3
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:15,600
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:16,633
Mark Hauser?

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,667
Who's this?

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,167
You know who it is.

7
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:21,534
MARK:
 <i>I already gave you</i>
 <i>what you asked for.</i>

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,667
But your employer

9
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,700
has tightened security,

10
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,767
so the access I paid for
is no good.

11
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,867
It'll take some time to download
the new security protocols.

12
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:32,034
I'll give them 40 minutes.

13
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,967
Federal agent!

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,334
Down on the floor!

15
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,267
 <i>Bill, Hauser admitted</i>
 <i>to selling Gredenko</i>

16
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,800
the security specs for Edgemont
nuclear power facility.

17
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,301
Does Gredenko have the specs?

18
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,267
Not yet. He's going to pick
them up in about 20 minutes.

19
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:46,101
Hauser was wounded, but he's got
a brother that Gredenko knows.

20
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,334
We're going to use him

21
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:49,134
 <i>to go through</i>
 <i>with the transaction.</i>

22
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:51,301
You look nervous, Brady.

23
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,501
All teams,
take out your targets.

24
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:58,134
There's a third hostile
inside the vehicle!

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,534
You know who I am

26
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:04,834
and you know
what I'm going to do to you

27
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,034
unless you tell me
where the bombs are.

28
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,367
First my terms:

29
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,900
amnesty from

30
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:14,167
your government and a guarantee
I won't be returned to Russia.

31
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,633
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,201
I don't know if I can accept
that she betrayed us.

33
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,501
She spied for Fayed?

34
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,767
 <i>I think we're wrong.</i>

35
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,501
I hear you and Nadia Yassir
are friends.

36
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:26,800
Yeah. Why do you ask?

37
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,167
'Cause I came across

38
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,234
evidence
at the switching station

39
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,234
that proves Nadia's innocent.

40
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,700
You're clear, Nadia.

41
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:38,534
Admiral Smith,
is the <i>Vickery</i> ready to launch?

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,700
It's seconds from
optimal launch position,

43
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,934
Mr. Vice President.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,667
Good, proceed
with the strike.

45
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,667
HAYES:
Vice President Daniels

46
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:49,600
is about to launch a nuclear
strike against the Middle East.

47
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,101
This strike is a complete
reversal of everything

48
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,568
your brother was working for.

49
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:58,167
You want Dr. Welton
to bring him out of the coma.

50
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,934
Yes.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,201
(phone rings)

52
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:03,067
It's for you, sir.

53
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,201
Yes.

54
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,633
I've called off the strike,
Noah.

55
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,067
I'm resuming my duties
as Commander in Chief.

56
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,733
Inform Admiral Smith
and the others

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,267
there's to be no hostile action
without my direct

58
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,067
authorization.

59
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,101
It's apparent to me that
the president is still suffering

60
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:21,967
the effects
from the attack on his life.

61
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:23,600
I can't let him remain in power.

62
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,667
Get me the Attorney General.

63
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:41,568
LENNOX: Secretary Dawes,
can you see and hear me clearly?

64
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, I can.

65
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,101
What about Secretary Durant
and Attorney General Graves?

66
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,401
Their connections
are being set up now.

67
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,401
How about the president?

68
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,167
He should be arriving
any moment.

69
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,034
What are you doing?

70
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,834
I need to get up
from this wheelchair.

71
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,834
No, you need
to take care
of yourself.

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Sandra, I can't afford
to look weak.

73
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,767
Roosevelt did just fine
from a wheelchair.

74
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,667
Listen, when I face Daniels,
I want to be on my feet.

75
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:12,800
Dr. Welton?

76
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,367
Yes, sir?

77
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,101
Can you give me a shot
of adrenaline?

78
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,834
Wayne.

79
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,367
I can.

80
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,267
It'll raise your
blood pressure,

81
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,934
which is not what
you need right now.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,967
Could elevate
the risk...
(knocking)

83
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,867
Mr. President,
it is time.

84
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,334
Give us a few minutes, please.

85
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,633
Yes, sir.

86
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,000
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

87
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,267
Mr. President...

88
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,667
Just do it.

89
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,401
Now.

90
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:47,334
(phone beeps)
What do you have, Jack?

91
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,367
Gredenko offered us Fayed
in exchange for immunity

92
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,667
and a guarantee that we won't
extradite him back to Russia.

93
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,534
Bill, I don't trust him.

94
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,834
He rolled over
too easy.

95
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,367
What do you think
his play is?

96
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:58,733
I don't know yet.

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,568
Well, it's your call, Jack.

98
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,867
But you should know
what's happening in Washington.

99
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:06,000
President Palmer's
regained consciousness.

100
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,234
How is he?

101
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,234
Well enough to reassert
his claim on the presidency.

102
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:12,167
but Daniels is challenging
him under the 25th amendment

103
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,700
in large part
so he can go ahead

104
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,000
with the nuclear strike
against Fayed's country.

105
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,733
Does he have a chance
of winning?

106
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,667
It's unclear, but if Fayed
detonates another bomb,

107
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,167
no one will be able
to stand in Daniels' way.

108
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:26,201
If there's a challenge
for the presidency,

109
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,633
the immunity agreement
will have no authority.

110
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,934
It won't be binding.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,034
Bill, you need to understand
that I have no intention

112
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,301
of honoring
this agreement.

113
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,267
Tell the Attorney General,
fill out the papers.

114
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,101
I'm calling him right now.

115
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,501
The president should be here
momentarily.

116
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,800
Mr. President.
Mr. President.

117
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,900
Mr. President,

118
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,800
I know I speak
for everyone here in saying

119
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,633
how very happy I am to have you
with us again.

120
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,534
Let's proceed.

121
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:33,034
(Lennox clears throat)

122
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:37,034
LENNOX:
As you know, an attempt was made
to assassinate the president.

123
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:40,067
He sustained injuries so serious
that the doctors had

124
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:43,267
to induce a temporary coma

125
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,367
in order to relieve
the pressure on his brain.

126
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:47,468
In so doing,
they saved his life.

127
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,800
The question now is whether,

128
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,834
in the words
of the 25th amendment,

129
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,534
he is unable to discharge the
duties and powers of his office.

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
Mr. Lennox,

131
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,134
isn't this really
a medical question?

132
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,334
Well, to a degree it is,

133
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:03,667
but the 25th amendment

134
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:07,434
puts the final decision squarely
in the hands of the Cabinet.

135
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,900
May we hear medical testimony?

136
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,234
Yes, we may.

137
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,067
And to that end, let me bring in
the surgeon in charge

138
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,134
of the president's case.

139
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,167
Dr. Welton,
if you would, please.

140
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,800
The president has undergone
an ordeal,

141
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,633
but from a medical
point of view,

142
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,267
I believe the greatest danger
is passed.

143
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,600
His cognitive functions
are presenting normally.

144
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,767
I have every expectation
that President Palmer

145
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,167
will make a full recovery.

146
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:34,834
GILES:
Might the pressures
of the office

147
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,367
increase the possibility
of a relapse?

148
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,600
It's difficult to say.

149
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,867
It's certainly a possibility.

150
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:40,501
Can you estimate those chances?

151
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm afraid I can't.

152
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,934
If you had a vote, Doctor,
how would you cast it?

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,934
This is precisely the question
which the Constitution

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,034
demands that
this Cabinet answer.

155
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:53,501
Thank you very much, Doctor.

156
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:56,934
Uh, Mr. President, I think now
would be an appropriate time

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,900
to address the Cabinet,
if you would, please.

158
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,700
The vice president initiated
this process

159
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,867
because I stopped him
from launching a nuclear strike

160
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,534
against the Middle East.

161
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,067
But this vote shouldn't be
about policy.

162
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:13,167
According to the Constitution,
you're judging me

163
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,367
to see if I am unable

164
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,733
to discharge the duties
of my office.

165
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,501
Well, as you can see,
and as you were just told

166
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,301
by my physician, I'm in complete
possession of my faculties,

167
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,234
and so to remove me
from this office

168
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,434
would be to betray
both your oath

169
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:32,700
and the American people
who voted me as their president.

170
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:40,434
All right, Mr. Vice President.

171
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:46,234
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Cabinet,

172
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:48,000
the 25th amendment
is purposely vague

173
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,934
on how you're supposed
to judge if a president

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,733
is unable to discharge
his duties.

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,501
It's open
to interpretation,

176
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,401
which is why
this is very much about

177
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,301
the president's policies
and his actions.

178
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,167
Here are the facts:

179
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:04,000
When a second nuclear attack
today spread radiation

180
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,534
over one of our major cities,
I decided

181
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,667
it was necessary to launch
a retaliatory strike

182
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:12,767
to show our enemies
that if attacked,

183
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,700
we would make them share
our pain.

184
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,267
Wayne Palmer's

185
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:21,334
first act upon regaining
consciousness

186
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,401
was to stop that strike;

187
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:29,367
to respond to the attack
by doing nothing.

188
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,834
In a time of war,

189
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,633
the president must be strong
enough in body and mind

190
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,067
to defend this country.

191
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:39,600
And I'm afraid
Wayne Palmer's actions

192
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:45,101
are the proof in this matter
that indeed,

193
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,667
he is unable
to discharge his duties.

194
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,568
All right,
time is of the essence,

195
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:59,501
so unless there's an objection,
I would like to recess

196
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:02,667
and then reconvene
for your vote in ten minutes.

197
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,667
--Any word on the
Cabinet vote?

198
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,934
No, they haven't
come back yet.

199
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,801
Look, Milo,
about what happened today,

200
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,567
let's just put it
behind us, okay?

201
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:40,801
Oh, which part,
the suspicion of terrorism

202
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:44,001
or the... the other thing?

203
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:45,734
The suspicion.

204
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:46,901
And the other thing?

205
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:48,934
Let's not worry about it
right now.

206
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,267
Let's try and get
through the day.

207
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,434
Okay.

208
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,567
I'm not going to
forget about the kiss,

209
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,100
and I don't think
you are, either.

210
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,734
(phone rings)

211
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,068
Nadia.

212
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,834
Nadia, it's Doyle.
Don't say my name,

213
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,133
just listen.

214
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,467
All right.

215
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,001
Okay. I need you to come up
to my office right now

216
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,334
and don't say anything
to anybody, just come.

217
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,867
On my way.

218
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,701
(sighs)

219
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:28,667
Have a seat.

220
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,734
Look, I know you and I
got off to kind of a bad start.

221
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,767
A bad start?

222
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,434
You assaulted me.

223
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,334
This country is under attack
by Islamic terrorists.

224
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,167
We had reason to believe there
was a mole in this building.

225
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,734
Starting with you wasn't racist.

226
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,167
It was common sense.

227
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,601
Oh, okay, so you're not
a racist, you're just a sadist.

228
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,334
You don't know me.

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,068
I think I do.

230
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,601
Why'd you call me here?

231
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,267
It turns out
there was no mole.

232
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,801
The terrorists were able
to hack into our system

233
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,934
'cause someone screwed up
and logged the wrong

234
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,001
security parameters.

235
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,867
I'm pretty sure
that someone was Milo,

236
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,734
and the proof
is on his computer.

237
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,034
I need someone to get it
without him noticing.

238
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,901
I can't do that.

239
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,667
Why? Is it 'cause
you're too busy

240
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,068
deciding if you want
to sleep with him?

241
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:24,968
Listen, if you don't get
the evidence for me,

242
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,634
I'm going to call a forensics
team, and they're going to come

243
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:30,267
and tear his system apart
as the entire floor watches.

244
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:33,233
And if they find what I think
they're going to find,
everyone gets to watch

245
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,467
Milo hauled out of this building
in handcuffs.

246
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:38,233
I'm sure it wasn't pleasant
when it happened to you.

247
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,367
But you're going to stand by

248
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,867
and watch it happen to him?

249
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,901
That's your idea
of being a friend.

250
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,500
So you want me to betray him
for his own good.

251
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,601
I promise you,
Milo will be better off

252
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,734
if you help me
than if you don't.

253
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,068
Your call.

254
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:59,634
If the Cabinet sides with you,

255
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,167
what are you going to do
about Daniels?

256
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,434
Unfortunately, Karen,

257
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,767
the Constitution doesn't
allow the president

258
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,934
to fire his
vice president.
No, but you can

259
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,467
marginalize him.
Karen's right.

260
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:10,267
Get him out of the bunker.
I would love to,
but Daniels has

261
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:12,100
way too many supporters,
and I can't afford

262
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,968
to alienate any one of them
right now.

263
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,467
Besides, I'd rather
have him somewhere

264
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,133
where I can keep an eye on him.

265
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,434
Mr. President,

266
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,334
the Cabinet's
reconvening.
Thank you.

267
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,834
HAYES:
All right, let's go.

268
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,534
Please, sit.

269
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,167
All right,
ladies and gentlemen

270
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,567
of the Cabinet,
let us now begin the vote.

271
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:55,400
Will those of you who believe
that President Palmer <i>is</i> able

272
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,300
to discharge his duties

273
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,467
please, at this time,
raise your hand.

274
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,968
Do we have any abstentions?

275
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:17,167
Uh, the vote is seven to seven.

276
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:20,867
LENNOX:
Mr. Attorney General,

277
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,834
what would be the next step?

278
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,068
Well, there's no need
for a next step.

279
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,034
The amendment requires
that the vice president

280
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,300
and a majority
of the Cabinet agree.

281
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,534
There is no majority
in the Cabinet.

282
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:33,934
It's split evenly.

283
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,601
President Palmer
remains in office.

284
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,400
NOAH:
It's not that simple--

285
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,767
one of the Cabinet votes
is invalid.

286
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:49,233
LENNOX:
Uh... sir,
wh-which vote is not valid?

287
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,834
National Security Advisor.

288
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,901
What are you
talking about?
She resigned.

289
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,167
I resumed my duties.

290
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,400
I don't agree.

291
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,934
And I haven't seen
any evidence

292
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,300
that you've been reinstated.

293
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,867
That is ridiculous!
I sat here <i>with you</i>

294
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:02,701
in a Cabinet meeting

295
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,901
less than one hour ago!
Ms. Hayes,

296
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:07,601
allowing you to sit in on
the meeting isn't the equivalent

297
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,267
of formally recognizing you
as National Security Advisor.

298
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,968
In fact, I did not

299
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:13,434
and do not so recognize you.

300
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,601
Oh, my God!

301
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:18,133
And if Ms. Hayes'
vote is invalid,

302
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,968
then the tally's seven to six

303
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:23,400
in favor of invoking the
25th amendment and removing...

304
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,601
President Palmer
from power.

305
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,934
I'm sorry, Wayne.

306
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:33,534
Noah, don't waste
your apologies on me,

307
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:36,634
because I won't let you
steal the presidency.

308
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,467
That's just not going to happen.

309
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:41,068
And what do you suggest?
The country has to be governed.

310
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,968
LENNOX:
Well, I would suggest,
sir, that this is

311
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,400
properly a matter
for the courts.

312
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,601
I concur.

313
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,801
We don't have time to go to...

314
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,167
GRAVES:
Mr. Vice President, if I may.

315
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:52,667
I agree with Mr. Lennox--
this is a legal question.

316
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:55,734
The Supreme Court
was in session this afternoon.

317
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:59,500
We can recall it and have them
render a decision regarding

318
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,901
the validity of the vote.

319
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,500
The whole matter could be
resolved in well under an hour.

320
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:04,801
Well, thank you,
Attorney General Graves.

321
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,534
Why don't you simply
get the process started,

322
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,467
and keep us advised
of your progress.

323
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,634
Certainly.

324
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,968
I think this meeting
is concluded.

325
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,567
(quietly):
Get my affidavit started.

326
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,367
Tom.

327
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,267
You know something?

328
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:35,233
I'm beginning to think
you're not on my side.

329
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,701
Well, sir, I'm on the side
of the United States of America,

330
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,567
and if you ever
thought otherwise,

331
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:42,133
you were very much mistaken.

332
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:57,201
--Gredenko's attorney approved
the immunity agreements.

333
00:15:57,268 --> 00:16:00,334
Yeah, we're just waiting
for digital signatures.

334
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,167
All right.

335
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:03,700
I'll inform the attorney
general's office

336
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:04,834
it's on its way.

337
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,400
Thank you.

338
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,634
Milo.

339
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,400
What's up?
I'm having a problem

340
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,201
with my station--
it keeps telling me

341
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,700
to refresh
the system credentials.

342
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:14,967
Uh, it's the
hardware codes.

343
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:17,268
You have to reset them
in the machine room.

344
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:20,134
I can take care of it.
Thanks.

345
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,700
You okay?

346
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,334
Yeah.
(laughs softly)

347
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,500
Well, you were right.

348
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,967
Milo forgot to refresh
the security parameters.

349
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,334
The breach <i>was</i> his fault.

350
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,934
So when you tell District,

351
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,067
they can fire and maybe
even arrest him.

352
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:06,368
Which is why
I'm going

353
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,167
to alter the logs so
they'll never know.

354
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,201
(sighs):
This should work,

355
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,734
as long as they haven't
changed the password.

356
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:19,934
(beep)

357
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:22,567
There. It's done.

358
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,034
Why'd you do that?

359
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:27,034
'Cause all I care about
is finding those nukes,

360
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,901
and we have a better chance of
doing that with Milo on board,

361
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,400
whether he likes me or not.

362
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:37,368
"And mankind was naught
by a single nation."

363
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,533
You've read the Koran.

364
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Yeah, and the Bible
and the Upanishads.

365
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,500
Anything I can get my hands on.

366
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,600
You're lucky--

367
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:47,734
you found your answers.

368
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,433
I'm looking for mine.

369
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,901
I'm going to get ready
to deploy.

370
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,334
What did Doyle want?

371
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,368
Nothing. We were just
reviewing some data sets.

372
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:32,901
Oh, your... system's back up.

373
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,667
Thanks.

374
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,934
(phone rings)

375
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,167
Buchanan.

376
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,901
HAYES:
Hi. It's me.

377
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,134
Hey, how did
the Cabinet vote go?

378
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,101
It was a tie, which, in effect,

379
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,067
means that Palmer's
still in office.

380
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,901
Good, that's good.
That's what we wanted.

381
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,067
Yes, well, Daniels is
contesting the vote.

382
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:10,867
He's saying that
mine is invalid.

383
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,167
Based on what?

384
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,001
Based on the fact
that I resigned,

385
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,767
and I was never
officially reinstated.

386
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,167
That's ridiculous.

387
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,067
You attended Cabinet meetings;
you had no replacement assigned.

388
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:23,467
How does he explain that?
I know, but maybe
he's right, Bill.

389
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,767
I did hand in my resignation.

390
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:28,201
Which was rescinded before
it was officially accepted.

391
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,667
Daniels knows that.

392
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,667
He's grasping at straws, Karen.

393
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,101
I'm so scared, Bill.

394
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,667
If he wins...
this will all be my fault.

395
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:39,500
Stop, stop.

396
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,134
It's desperate maneuvering
on his part,

397
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:43,634
Karen, nothing more.

398
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,600
He hasn't got a case.

399
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,934
And the Supreme Court
will agree.

400
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,767
Well, we're giving our arguments
in 15 minutes.

401
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:54,734
Call me as soon
as the decision is in.

402
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,567
Thank you for being there.

403
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,700
You don't have to thank me.

404
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,533
It's my job.

405
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
(laughs)

406
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,567
I miss you so much.

407
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,201
I miss you, too.

408
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,734
I'll talk to you soon.

409
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,734
Bye.

410
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,101
(long sigh)

411
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,234
(Gredenko speaking Russian)

412
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,901
(man speaks Russian over phone)

413
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,268
 <i>Dasvidanya.</i>

414
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:27,600
(snaps cell phone shut)

415
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:31,201
Good. My attorney
has verified the agreements.

416
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,467
Bill, we're set.

417
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,134
Gredenko's ready
to make the call.

418
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,134
All right, Jack,
we're standing by.

419
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,567
Doyle's got a team ready to go
as soon as Fayed tells Gredenko

420
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:39,834
where to meet him.
Copy that.

421
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,201
You try and warn Fayed

422
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:43,901
with anything you say
or how you say it,

423
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,101
and I will kill you
right here right now.

424
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,101
I believe you, Agent Bauer.

425
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,634
Make the call.

426
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:00,101
(phone rings)

427
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,268
Yes?

428
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:03,600
It's me.

429
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,201
Do you have the security
protocols for the power plant?

430
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:07,201
Yes.

431
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:08,934
Where do you want to meet?

432
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,634
Are you certain
you're not under surveillance?

433
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,034
Of course.

434
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,368
Do you think I'd be
calling you otherwise?

435
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,368
I can't allow another
one of your mistakes

436
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,634
to disrupt my plans
for the remaining two devices.

437
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,867
Do you want
the protocols or not?

438
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,500
Where are you right now?

439
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,368
Culver City.

440
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,268
Meet me at the Santa Monica Pier
in ten minutes.

441
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,533
GREDENKO:
Um, it may take me more time.

442
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,834
I won't wait.

443
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,334
Where do I find you?

444
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,001
Just be there.

445
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:37,634
I'll find you.

446
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,500
Give him the phone.

447
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,800
Bill, how long will
it take Doyle's team

448
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,067
to make it to the pier?

449
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:46,567
He's about 30 minutes out, Jack.

450
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:48,067
We'll make due with Ryan's team.

451
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,734
Put him in the vehicle.

452
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Instructions from
the Supreme Court.

453
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,301
Our arguments have
to be submitted in writing,

454
00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:03,101
in the next ten minutes.

455
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,500
Sandra's working
on our brief.

456
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,800
How's it coming?

457
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,234
I'm just about finished.

458
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,134
We have a strong case.

459
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,101
You resigned, and Daniels

460
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,201
was in charge
when you returned,

461
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,334
so the legal question is,

462
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,301
did he consent
to your reinstatement?

463
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,767
Of course he did.

464
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,334
And he made no objections when
you returned to the bunker,

465
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,901
you sat in his
first Cabinet meeting,

466
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,201
and he never questioned
your right to be there?

467
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:27,400
No, he didn't.

468
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:31,368
His own actions
prove our case.

469
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,234
Thank you...
for everything, Sandra.

470
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,767
My affidavit explains
everything--

471
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,667
that I never really intended
to reinstate Karen,

472
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,700
I was only allowing her
to perform her duties

473
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,067
temporarily, therefore,
she had no authority

474
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,001
to cast a vote
under the 25th amendment.

475
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,967
The problem is,
after Karen returned,

476
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:57,234
you treated her
as if she were still
National Security Advisor.

477
00:22:57,301 --> 00:23:00,400
It's really a question of my
state of mind, though, isn't it?

478
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,334
Yes. And your state of mind

479
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,934
will be inferred
from your actions.

480
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:11,034
Doesn't sounds like you think
our chances are very good.

481
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:13,700
I don't.

482
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:19,334
Then I am... deeply afraid
for our country.

483
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,934
When the world sees
that Wayne Palmer

484
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:28,201
isn't willing to fight back,
our enemies will be encouraged.

485
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,400
These recent attacks will be

486
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,600
just the beginning.

487
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:35,334
America will be vulnerable
in a way it never has been.

488
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:41,634
There may be a way

489
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,667
to illuminate your state
of mind more explicitly.

490
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,134
I can swear an affidavit
that, earlier today,

491
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,301
you told me to
inform Karen Hayes

492
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,034
you had no intention
of reinstating her.

493
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:03,101
But that you were
going to allow her
to perform her duties

494
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,533
on a temporary basis only.

495
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,867
Then Wayne regained
consciousness

496
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,433
before I could have
that conversation with her.

497
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,967
Lisa, you're talking
about perjuring yourself

498
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,368
in front of the Supreme Court.

499
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:18,368
I'm aware that
it's perjury,

500
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:23,268
but the end
justifies the means.

501
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,234
My affidavit will
push the court to
rule in your favor

502
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:28,800
so that you can
do what's right
for this country.

503
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,500
You're right.

504
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,500
Do it.

505
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,901
Prepare your affidavit.

506
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,101
And, Lisa...

507
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,734
...thank you.

508
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,433
Yes, sir.

509
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:22,334
Kasim, Hassan, with me.

510
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,433
I'm meeting Gredenko.
I'll be back within the hour.

511
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,867
And if you're not?

512
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,101
Are you worried for me, Halil,

513
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,400
or just anxious
to take my place?

514
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:37,067
I think we're wasting time.

515
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:39,700
We have the bombs.
We should use them right now.

516
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,667
Gredenko's information 
will enable us

517
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,867
to inflict damage
across half of California.

518
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,400
There's other target out there

519
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,533
that will result
in large amount of casualties

520
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
without the additional risk.

521
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:52,533
I've made my decision.

522
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,600
Let's go.

523
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:12,700
Come in.

524
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,134
Mr. Vice President,

525
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,334
I need to speak with you alone.

526
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,467
There is something in this room
you need to know about, sir.

527
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,433
Something in this room?

528
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,467
What are you
talking about?

529
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,667
This small object here

530
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,368
is a microtransmitter.

531
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
After you directed me
to lie to the ambassador

532
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,800
about the attempted
assassination,

533
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:58,734
I decided it was time
to protect myself.

534
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Now it turns out I was
protecting the country as well.

535
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:05,234
Be careful, Tom.

536
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:08,134
Be very careful
what you try to do here.

537
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:13,034
Actually, sir, you are the one
who needs to be careful here.

538
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:19,700
LISA:
I'm aware that it's perjury,
but the end justifies the means.

539
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:22,067
My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favor

540
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:25,201
so that you can do what's right
for this country.

541
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,901
NOAH:
You're right.

542
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,567
Do it.

543
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,101
Prepare your affidavit.

544
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,800
Turn it off.

545
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:38,368
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,
conspiracy to commit perjury

546
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,867
is a felony offense.

547
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,667
Now, I strongly urge you

548
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:46,234
to pick up that phone
and call the Supreme Court

549
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:49,001
and tell them that you have
withdrawn your affidavit,

550
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,433
and that of
Ms. Miller as well.

551
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,067
Tell them that you support
the vote of the Cabinet.

552
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:55,334
That you have
no further objections

553
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,834
to President Palmer
continuing his presidency.

554
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:01,767
You do understand
that I'm just trying

555
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,368
to do what's right
for this country.

556
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,433
Well, so am I, sir.

557
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,900
--Karen, I need
the launch protocols

558
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:28,767
the Joint Chiefs set up
with Vice President Daniels

559
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,134
along with chain
of command signing.

560
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,568
They just came over
from the Pentagon.

561
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,733
Everything is in place.

562
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,134
If the court sides with you,
you can cancel the strike

563
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:38,700
permanently.

564
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,700
I also need want an update
on the situation with Fayed.

565
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,201
(hoarsely):
Has CTU made any progress?

566
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,434
Yes, they have
Gredenko in custody.

567
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,000
The last time I talked to Bill,

568
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:47,267
they said they were going
to use him to lure Fayed

569
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,267
out in the open.

570
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:49,267
Who's running it?

571
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:50,733
Jack Bauer.

572
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,401
Good.
SANDRA:
Wayne.

573
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:54,067
The Supreme Court
was just notified

574
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:56,434
Daniels withdrew his suit.

575
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,134
What?
It's over.

576
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,633
He gave up before the
court had a chance

577
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,101
to make its decision.

578
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,000
Why?

579
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't know.

580
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,234
I just know
that you're still

581
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:07,633
the President of
the United States.

582
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,067
(breathing heavily)

583
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:18,000
Let the Cabinet know
I won't take any action 

584
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:20,201
against those who sided
with the vice president.

585
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:22,234
Yes, sir.

586
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,800
Oh, and, Karen,

587
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:26,633
tell Bill I want him to keep me
up to date on CTU's progress.

588
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:40,633
(breathing heavily)

589
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,733
Melinda.

590
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,501
Tell Dr. Welton I need
to see him, please.

591
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:48,267
I don't have a visual yet,

592
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,468
but Fayed won't show himself
until he sees Gredenko.

593
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:51,501
BUCHANAN:
Understood. Ryan,

594
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:52,867
what's your status
with Gredenko?

595
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,501
RYAN:
I've got
the audio transmitter set up.

596
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,468
I'm preparing
the tracker now.

597
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,468
Roll up your left sleeve.

598
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,934
JACK:
What's its range?

599
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,301
We can track the isotope's
signature up to 15 miles.

600
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,568
Copy that.

601
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,867
(winces)

602
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,733
Is it radioactive?

603
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Yes.

604
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:13,034
It penetrates
into the bone.

605
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:15,134
It's got a half-life
of about 11 hours,

606
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,633
so you can forget about
trying to dig it out
or making a run for it.

607
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,568
He's good to go.
JACK: Bill.

608
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,167
How far out is Doyle's team?

609
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:22,468
About 20 minutes.

610
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:23,568
We can't wait.

611
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:26,301
Fayed was clear
about his timeline.

612
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,301
Ryan,

613
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,600
send in Gredenko.

614
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:31,201
Gredenko's moving now.

615
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,568
CHLOE: I'm getting
a clean audio signal

616
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,900
from the transmitter
on Gredenko.

617
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,767
And we are locked
on the isotope signature

618
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:50,034
that's being emitted
from Gredenko's arm.

619
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:13,867
(phone ringing)

620
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,867
Hello.

621
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:30,700
Hello?

622
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,800
I have the gain on Gredenko's
transmitter up all the way.

623
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,633
There's no one
on the other end of the call.

624
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:40,733
He's reading something
off his phone.

625
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,234
It's a text message.

626
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:43,301
Fayed's made contact.

627
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,367
Everyone get ready.

628
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,967
Gredenko is heading south.

629
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,334
Milo, have you got him
on the tracker?

630
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:55,167
Yeah, he's still moving.

631
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,134
I'm heading in.

632
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:00,301
I'm going to follow him.

633
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,867
* *

634
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:02,568
I've lost audio signal.

635
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,134
I'm going to secondary channel.

636
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:06,700
There's no audio
on the secondary channel.

637
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,900
But he hasn't moved.

638
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,934
I don't like it.
Something's wrong.

639
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:17,167
You led them to me.

640
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,067
I had no choice.

641
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:22,700
But if you listen to me,

642
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,367
we'll both get
away from here alive.

643
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:27,101
Kasim.

644
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:44,434
Which direction, Milo?

645
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,434
I'm nearing the south end
of the pier.

646
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:47,468
That's where he stopped

647
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,468
and entered the building
on the left.

648
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:05,967
Is he still inside the room?

649
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:09,667
Yes, he's right on the other
side of the door.

650
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,700
I'm going in.

651
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,401
Milo, no one's in here.

652
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,334
Jack! The tracker's
showing the signal

653
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:22,067
right there
in the same room with you.

654
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,568
My God.

655
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:36,633
He cut off Gredenko's arm.

656
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,667
Ryan, move your men in now!

657
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,067
RYAN:
Roger that. Let's go.

658
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:44,501
Hold on.

659
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:47,534
I've picked up his blood trail.

660
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,000
Fayed,

661
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:53,167
their men will be coming
from the west side parking lot.

662
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:57,201
We should go this way.

663
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,401
Ryan, have your men circle back
to the east side of the pier.

664
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,401
Try and cut them off.

665
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,334
--Ryan, have you got anything?
Negative.

666
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,434
How far out
is Doyle's team?

667
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:19,434
20 minutes.

668
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,701
Have him set up a perimeter

669
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:22,167
as soon as he gets here.

670
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,967
Ryan, where are you?!

671
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,134
I'm pinned down!

672
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,734
Moving towards
you now.

673
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,033
Show me your head.

674
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,167
TV REPORTER:
But sources indicate that

675
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,067
the same terrorist
cell is most likely

676
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:05,734
responsible for the nuclear
explosion in Valencia...

677
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:06,734
We're trapped.

678
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:09,067
This way.

679
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,567
That's him.

680
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:14,768
I recognize him
from the news.

681
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:18,033
He's the terrorist
they're looking for.

682
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:21,933
MAN:
That <i>is</i> him.

683
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,967
You bastard.

684
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:39,701
Federal agent!
(two gunshots)

685
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:41,100
I am a federal agent!

686
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,701
I'm taking
this man into custody.

687
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,768
Now, back off!

688
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,200
Back off!

689
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:46,401
He shot my friend.

690
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,667
I'm sorry about your friend.

691
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,267
We'll get him medical attention.
Just stay back.

692
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,667
I hope your friend is dead.
Shut up!

693
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:53,967
Everybody out
of the bar now!

694
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,200
Move!

695
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,667
Gredenko is not here.

696
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:00,601
I need you to lock down the
area and initiate a search.

697
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,033
We have two men down.

698
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,234
One is a civilian, the other
is Fayed. He's in custody.

699
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,334
I need Medical
up here <i>now.</i>

700
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:07,801
All right, Jack. Good work.

701
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:09,900
Nadia, get me the president,
please.

702
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:18,601
I understand you're weak.

703
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,501
Another dose of
adrenaline will raise

704
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,267
your blood pressure
levels even higher,

705
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:24,334
to the point where we know
there'll be vascular damage.

706
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:26,467
And that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

707
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:27,801
Your well-being
is my responsibility.

708
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:29,900
And my responsibility, Doctor,

709
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,300
is to the well-being
of this country.

710
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:33,267
So give me another dose
so I can go back

711
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,134
to doing my job or I will find
someone else who will.

712
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,634
MELINDA:
Mr. President,

713
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,534
Bill Buchanan is on line one.

714
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,634
I'll take it.

715
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:02,167
Thank you, Arthur.

716
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,434
Yes, sir.

717
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,033
Bill.

718
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,267
Mr. President, I'm calling

719
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:19,467
to tell you that Jack
has Fayed in custody.

720
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:20,801
What about the bombs?

721
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,801
We haven't finished
the radiological scan yet,

722
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,067
so we can't confirm the bombs
are in the immediate vicinity.

723
00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:27,634
Jack is going to interrogate
Fayed as soon as possible.

724
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,933
But there's no way of knowing
how long that will take

725
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,567
or how successful
that will be, right?

726
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:32,567
No, sir.

727
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:33,634
All right, Bill.

728
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,601
That's what I wanted to know.

729
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:36,634
Thank you, sir.

730
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:35,334
But since the case
was withdrawn,

731
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:37,601
the court has no reason
to retain the documents.

732
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,200
They should be sealed
and returned to me immediately.

733
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:41,567
Okay. Good. Thank you.

734
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,667
I was thinking
that maybe

735
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,367
it's time to
declare a truce.

736
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,434
Okay. Well... maybe it is.

737
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,900
You know, we both want the
same thing for this country--

738
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:00,033
what's good for the country.

739
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,734
We just don't always
agree on the means.

740
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:06,801
I would love to go forward
without the threats

741
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:08,267
and the intimidation.

742
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:12,300
Done.

743
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,167
Good.

744
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:15,401
One more thing.

745
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,334
Do you know why
the vice president

746
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:19,267
withdrew his suit
from the Supreme Court?

747
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,834
No. I have no idea. Why?

748
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,834
Well, one of
my aides saw you

749
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,000
with him before
it was announced.

750
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:30,601
I... I guess just put this down
to happy coincidence.

751
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,734
For now.

752
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,868
But someday I'd love to know
the realstory.

753
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,000
Okay. Some day.
(phone rings)

754
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,033
Lennox.

755
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:44,401
He...

756
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:47,534
This cannot be,
this has got to be some mistake.

757
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:49,634
I'm on my way.

758
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:51,634
President Palmer.
What?

759
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:54,701
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

760
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:00,967
Mr. President.

761
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:04,401
If I may, sir.

762
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:08,300
I understand you're about
to launch the very strike

763
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,801
we just prevented Vice President
Daniels from launching.

764
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:11,967
That's right.

765
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:14,334
This makes no sense, sir.

766
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:16,634
I mean it's what
you risked your life to stop.

767
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:19,467
Tom, I risked my life
to reassert my authority.

768
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,933
I've got Vice President Daniels
calling me weak.

769
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,033
Even you thought the same thing.

770
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,200
I implore you, sir,

771
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,467
do not mistake being reckless
with being strong.

772
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:30,100
Tom, I am done talking.

773
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,401
Mr. President.

774
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:34,000
We have a successful launch.

775
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,434
Good.

776
