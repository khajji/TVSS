1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,067
I would like you

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,133
to appear on television
and appeal to members

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,734
of Islamic communities
everywhere.

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,234
<i>The majority
of your cabinet feels</i>

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,934
that you're making
a tragic mistake.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,734
The man has murdered
countless innocents,

7
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:27,901
and you are putting your hopes

8
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:30,167
for this country's safety
on him.

9
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:31,567
They will come after you.

10
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,400
I assure you of that.

11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,601
We're talking about removing the
President of the United States.

12
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,267
We are in the middle
of a national crisis,

13
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,501
and he is in over his head.

14
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,033
<i>He has brought
this on himself.</i>

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,567
I need the president's
itinerary,

16
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:47,834
specifically in regards
to Assad's televised address.

17
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,234
Why do you need this?

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,701
The less you know,
the better.

19
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,200
Because of me,
Fayed has a device

20
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,267
that can arm all the bloody
suitcase nukes he was.s.

21
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:56,601
<i>CHLOE:
You can't blame yourself.</i>

22
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,767
When the next bomb goes off,

23
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,501
and thousands
of more people die,

24
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,467
everybody will remember
that I was the one

25
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:02,834
that made it possible.

26
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,701
CTU found me.

27
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,634
<i>I needed to preoccupy them</i>

28
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,868
with a bomb
to enable my escape.

29
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,634
The delivery system software

30
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,701
was programmed
for five detonations

31
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,834
at five high-priority targets.

32
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,801
Because of your carelessness,

33
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,234
we are now down to three.

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,400
More than enough for
our needs,Gredenko.

35
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:21,167
Our country lost the Cold War

36
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,601
because it was afraid
to use these weapons

37
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,701
against the Americans.

38
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,367
Today we will
correct that mistake,

39
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,734
and the Arabs will
take all the blame.

40
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,501
Marilyn, it is vital that
we find this man Gredenko.

41
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,534
If we retrace the route
that you took that night,

42
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,801
do you think that you
would recognize the house?

43
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:38,734
Maybe.

44
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,367
What's going on
with you and Jack?

45
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:43,701
<i>He's looking for someone</i>

46
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:44,734
he thinks I can help.

47
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:46,434
You mean Gredenko?

48
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,133
What do you know about him?

49
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,234
I followed Graem
to a house one night,

50
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,734
he met with some Russians.

51
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,801
Jack wants to take me
over there to see

52
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:54,934
if it can jog my memory.

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,701
PHILLIP:
Now you're not going
to take Jack to the house

54
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:57,934
where Graem met the Russians.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,701
You're going to take him
to a different address.

56
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:02,367
Now you do this for me,
and I promise you

57
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:03,701
<i>you will see Josh again.</i>

58
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,801
<i>If you don't, he dies.</i>

59
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,734
Marilyn,
is any of this familiar?

60
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,467
<i>MARILYN:
Yes. That's it.</i>

61
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,767
The pale blue
house on the right.

62
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,200
JACK:
Are you sure?
Yeah.

63
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,000
Go! Go!

64
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,601
Bomb! Everyone out!

65
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,901
(automatic gunfire)
Come on, move, move, move!

66
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:26,400
Don't stop!

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
(phone rings)
Buchanan.

68
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,734
Bill, it's Jack.
BUCHANAN: What do you got?

69
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,133
We've been ambushed.

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,334
The house that Marilyn led us to
was wired with explosives.

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,834
Half my team is down--

72
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:06,300
I need you to send paramedics
to 9407 Hendry Place.

73
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:07,934
Bill, they knew
we were coming.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,934
You mean Gredenko?

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
Yeah, I think so.

76
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,167
Right now I'm trying
to find Milo and Marilyn.

77
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,901
I think they're being
pursued by hostiles.

78
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,300
I'll have a team
there in ten minutes.

79
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,701
I'll monitor local bandwidth,
see what I can come up with.

80
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,300
Bill, hurry,
we need to find them.

81
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,934
(breathleMarilyn, come on, we've
I-I can't...got to keep moving.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,934
You understand?
Come on, move.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,534
Move!

84
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,100
Check the warehouse.

85
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,000
(labored breathing)

86
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:13,033
REPORTER: The fallout has
prevented emergency workers

87
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,334
from coming within
several miles
(phone ringing)

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,767
of ground zero, but survivors
are being treated

89
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,334
at local hospitals and makeshift
medical facilities

90
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,534
like the one behind me.

91
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:23,100
Local authorities continue
to urge people

92
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,801
to stay in their home
until further notice.

93
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,868
Yeah?

94
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:33,334
HACKER:
We took out the CTU team.

95
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,868
So is my son dead?

96
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:36,701
Yes, sir.

97
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:42,334
(sighing):
Right, well...

98
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,567
had to be done.

99
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:46,634
You have Marilyn?

100
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,400
No, sir, not yet.

101
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:49,400
Why not yet?

102
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,734
She escaped with someone
from CTU,

103
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,868
but we're tracking them now.

104
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:52,968
Damn it, Hacker.

105
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,133
We'll find her soon, sir.

106
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,634
The man she's with doesn't look

107
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:57,868
like a trained field agent.

108
00:04:57,934 --> 00:04:59,767
Make sure you take her alive.

109
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,734
I need her to find Gredenko

110
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,767
so I can end this mess.

111
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,934
I understand, sir.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,734
I'll call you as soon
as I have her.

113
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,834
(clattering)

114
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,167
Hey.

115
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,300
They know we're here.

116
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,734
Are you sure?

117
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,400
Yeah.

118
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,601
Marilyn, listen to me.

119
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,167
I'm going to cover you.

120
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,701
When I do, I want you to head
back towards the alley.

121
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,701
I want you to run as fast

122
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,067
and as far away from here
as you can, you understand me?

123
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

124
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,200
The targets are right behind us.

125
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:46,934
Behind those Dumpsters.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Remember...

127
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,801
we need to take
that woman alive.

128
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,100
Just wait...
wait till I tell you.

129
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:57,868
Go!

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,434
(screaming)

131
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,934
I can't!

132
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,534
(cries out)

133
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:11,901
I told you to go!

134
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,334
I couldn't!

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
(groaning)

136
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:18,801
Let's go.

137
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:20,901
Wait! Wait!

138
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,567
Kill him.

139
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,167
(pained grunting)

140
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,400
(gunshots, Marilyn screams)

141
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,133
Drop your weapon!

142
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,234
Let her go!

143
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,968
Drop your weapon
or I will kill her.

144
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,567
If you wanted to kill her,
she'd be dead by now.

145
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,133
Now drop your weapon!

146
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,234
Or I will use mine!

147
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,501
Do it!

148
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,100
On your knees!

149
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,167
Now! Hands on your head!

150
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:53,701
Interlace your fingers!

151
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,367
Turn around and
face the fence!

152
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,767
Milo!

153
00:06:58,834 --> 00:06:59,801
Let me see it.

154
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,000
(pained groaning)

155
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,400
The bullet went
through and through.

156
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,734
There's no arterial bleeding.

157
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,667
You're going to be okay.
CTU will be here in a minute.

158
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:09,767
Take this gun.

159
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,767
Make sure he doesn't move.

160
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,267
(whimpering)

161
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,534
(screams)

162
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,934
That call you took,
that was from Gredenko.

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,801
You tipped him off!

164
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,100
Now over half
my team is dead!

165
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,801
You don't understand.
What don't I understand?

166
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,801
That Gredenko knew
we were coming?

167
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,601
It wasn't Gredenko
on the phone.

168
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,100
Those aren't his men.

169
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,767
If those weren't Gredenko's
men, whose were they?

170
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:31,834
Who sent them?

171
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:34,934
Your father.

172
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,901
What are you talking about?

173
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,734
It's true, Jack.

174
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:40,734
I swear.

175
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,367
Your father called me
in the car.

176
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:47,167
My father?

177
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,300
He told me to lead you
to that house.

178
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,334
He said if I didn't...

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,534
he said he'd killed Graem,

180
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:58,234
and that if he had to,
he would kill Josh.

181
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,434
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,434
He has my son.

183
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,067
(sobbing)

184
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:16,601
Marilyn.

185
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,834
Do you have the address
to Gredenko's safe house?

186
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,467
(mouthing)

187
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,267
I need you to give it to me now.

188
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,467
I can't.

189
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,934
I can't.
Not until I have my son.

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,868
I will help you get Josh back,

191
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:31,133
but I need that address now.

192
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,334
Gredenko is our only chance of
recovering the nuclear weapons.

193
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,067
You saw what happened in
Valencia earlier today.

194
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,100
This is going to be worse.

195
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,868
Please.

196
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:45,167
Just give me the address.

197
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,367
I recognized the house
once we were driving.

198
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:53,200
It's on Glascoe-- 9421.

199
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,033
Don't move.

200
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,267
(phone rings)
Buchanan.

201
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,834
Bill, it's Jack.

202
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,834
I've got the correct address
for Gredenko's safe house.

203
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,067
9421 Glascoe.

204
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,234
Turner's team will
be there any minute.

205
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,634
You run point on this.

206
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,200
No, I want you to send me a
smaller team to my location.

207
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:15,667
I'm at an industrial park
on Pine, just south of Oxford.

208
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,334
Make sure the team
brings me a vehicle

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
with a full tactical kit.

210
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,868
Then they're gngng to have
to transfer Milo back to CTU.

211
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,467
He's been shot,
but he's not critical.

212
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:23,767
I want you to divert
the rest of the team

213
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:24,801
to the address on Glascoe--

214
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,400
have them initiate the attack.

215
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,000
Get back to me as soon as soon
you've got Gredenko in custody.

216
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,000
Jack, what's going on?

217
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,701
I'll explain everything later.

218
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,834
That's not good enough.

219
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:34,067
Bill, please.

220
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,067
Just trust me.

221
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,100
This is personal.

222
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,501
Jack!

223
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:00,801
--Hi.

224
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,333
Hey.

225
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,634
Did you finish the vectors?

226
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,567
No.

227
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:09,333
You know, if you're having
trouble, I can help you.

228
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,333
I'm not having trouble.
I'm just not finished,

229
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,333
and I don't want this to turn
into another conversation

230
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,300
about whether or not I'm okay.

231
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,233
I'm sorry, love.

232
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,500
It's all right, but if you can't
talk to me, then you should talk

233
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,801
to a staff psychologist
or your sponsor.

234
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,267
I don't need a shrink.

235
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,367
I don't want to talk to my
sponsor, I'll be fine.

236
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:28,034
We just heard from Jack.

237
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,600
Marilyn Bauer's safe, and she
gave us Gredenko's location.

238
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,267
Milo was shot
during the operation,

239
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,667
but he's going to be okay.

240
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,300
What happened?
He held off three
armed hostiles

241
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,367
until Jack could get there.

242
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:37,600
From what I understand,

243
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,934
he's going to be up
for a commendation.

244
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,767
Morris, when Milo gets here,
I want you to debrief him

245
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:42,801
as soon as medical
gives you the okay.

246
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,001
Yeah, yeah, I'll debrief him,

247
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:45,934
and thanks for rubbing
that salt in the wounds.

248
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,867
What are you talking about?
The nukes are armed

249
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,034
because I'm a coward,

250
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,367
and now you want me to listen

251
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:51,967
to Milo talk about
what a bloody hero he is. Agh!

252
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:53,934
Coincidence?

253
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,034
It'll be taken care of, thanks.

254
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:59,068
Taken care of.

255
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:01,967
We're coordinating the Gredenko
operation from here.

256
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,200
Tac teams

257
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:04,567
are moving in on his location.

258
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,068
I'll be right there.

259
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,168
Obviously I pushed you
back to work too soon.

260
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,333
I'll have someone
from district relieve you.

261
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,233
No, no, that would
just make me feel worse.

262
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,333
Look, I need a few minutes--
I'll be fine.

263
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,567
I'm going to take a walk.

264
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,134
I'll cover for you,
but you need to be

265
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,168
back here
before we launch.
Yeah, I will.

266
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,467
Give me the phone;
we need to make the call.

267
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,867
Scramble collar
has to be enabled.

268
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,967
(indistinct communication
over police radio)

269
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,434
(beeping)

270
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,734
(distant siren blaring)

271
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,367
Give us a second, please.

272
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,834
Does he know where Phillip
is holding Josh?

273
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,200
No.

274
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,934
I'm gonna have to
force my father's hand.

275
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,534
Meaning what?

276
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,168
He's gonna call my father,

277
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,634
tell him he's
apprehended you,

278
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,233
but that you won't give
him Gredenko's location

279
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,901
until he takes you
to see your son.

280
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,867
What if Phillip refuses?

281
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,701
Then you have
to stay firm.

282
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,300
Tell him it's not a negotiation,
no matter what he threatens.

283
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,434
Jack, you're asking me
to put Josh's life at risk.

284
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,934
<i>Josh's life is at risk.</i>

285
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,934
Trust me, my father is not
going to give away his location

286
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,300
unless he thinks he has to.

287
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,867
Is that what this is about--
finding Phillip?

288
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:27,767
Josh is secondary?

289
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,134
My father will
have Josh with him.

290
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,367
Marilyn, I will do
everything in my power

291
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,600
to make sure
your son is safe.

292
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,567
How do you know
he won't betray us?

293
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:48,168
He wants to live.

294
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,068
Let's go.

295
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,434
You don't want to watch this.

296
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,734
You know, Josh...

297
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:18,634
your father
was very proud of you.

298
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,333
He used to tell me
how blessed he felt

299
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,134
knowing everything that he
was working so hard to build

300
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,467
would be left in
such good hands.

301
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:31,001
Do we really have to talk
about this right now, Grandpa?

302
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,001
No... of course not.

303
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:37,333
He loved you very much.

304
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:43,134
Remember, I'll be able to hear
both sides of this conversation.

305
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,801
You're set.

306
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,134
Dial.

307
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,801
(phone speed-dialing)

308
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:53,701
(phone rings)

309
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,134
Do you have her?

310
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,834
Yeah... but we
took casualties.

311
00:13:57,901 --> 00:13:59,168
I'm on my own now.

312
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,667
Are you assembling another team
to take out Gredenko?

313
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:04,001
Yeah, I am, but she's refusing

314
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:06,667
to tell me where Gredenko is
until she sees her son.

315
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,534
Put her on.

316
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,967
I did what you asked,
now where's Josh?

317
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:21,801
Marilyn, look,
I know you're frightened,

318
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,867
but this doesn't
have to end badly.

319
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,001
If you help me
find Gredenko,

320
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,701
we can all survive
this, as a family.

321
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,767
I don't know what
you're talking about.

322
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,967
I just want my son.

323
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:36,134
I'm just saying, you made
your deal with Graem.

324
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Now make a deal with me.

325
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:42,200
With enough time,
you and I... and Josh

326
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,367
can rebuild whatever is left
of this family.

327
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,734
After all, the legacy
I'm trying to preserve

328
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:49,233
will someday be his.

329
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,434
We can do this.

330
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,567
But first, you have to tell me
where Gredenko is.

331
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:59,400
Only after this man
takes me to see my son.

332
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,634
Bringing you here will only
complicate things,

333
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,101
and I need Gredenko now.

334
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,300
Tell me where he is.

335
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,834
No.

336
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,667
You may have misunderstood
my offer as a sign of weakness,

337
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:15,267
so let me
make it perfectly clear.

338
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,901
If you do not help me,
I see no future

339
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,600
for you or Josh.

340
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,168
I will walk

341
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,068
into the next room,
and I will kill him.

342
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,801
Right now.

343
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,400
Tell me... or Josh dies.

344
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,400
I will not tell you
what you want to know

345
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,101
until I have my son.

346
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:41,967
Give him back the phone.

347
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:46,500
(sobbing)

348
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Yeah?

349
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,333
Bring her to me
at the Grandmont Hotel.

350
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Room 2132.

351
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:52,834
We're on our way.

352
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,834
We got the address.

353
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:59,534
You did great.

354
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,068
Cuff him,
put him in the back.

355
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:03,200
(sniffles)

356
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,934
(handcuffs clicking)

357
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,134
Josh?

358
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,934
Uh, I'm just gonna
go downstairs

359
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,101
to get a soda.

360
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:17,467
Did you want anything?

361
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,767
No, thanks.

362
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,300
Did you look
in the minibar?

363
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,434
Uh, yeah, but there really
wasn't anything that I wanted.

364
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,801
Why don't you call
room service?

365
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,001
Well, I just feel like
getting out.

366
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:36,967
Josh...

367
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:39,333
Don't even
think about it.

368
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:47,233
No one's life is worth

369
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,001
the destruction
of everything I've built.

370
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,667
Now step away from the door.

371
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:10,668
--I was beginning
to worry.

372
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,967
Meeting went long.

373
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,934
Here's the President's
itinerary.

374
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,100
Oh, good.

375
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,100
This will work.

376
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,601
So when...
when does all this happen?

377
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:22,767
Now.

378
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,100
I need you to
authorize clearance

379
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,534
for someone to get
inside the bunker.

380
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:28,401
Once he's inside,
he'll carry the ball.

381
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,934
"Carry the ball"?

382
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,034
You mean, kill the President.

383
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,867
Sir, I would like to think
that we are beyond the point

384
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:34,934
of second-guessing ourselves.

385
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,967
This President has
endangered the lives

386
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,334
of millions of people.

387
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:41,134
You do not need to tell me
what the stakes are here.

388
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:45,534
So who is this person
we're putting inside?

389
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,334
He's a security specialist,
private sector,

390
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,000
but I've already put in
a request

391
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,733
for him to advise my group
on civil response options.

392
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,167
He has level two clearance;
I just need you upgrade him.

393
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,267
They will trace this thing
right back to me.

394
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,034
No. You won't even
be investigated.

395
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,601
We have a cover.

396
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,367
A cover? Who?

397
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,100
Assad.

398
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,501
Assad?

399
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,501
You're trying to make it
look like he did this?

400
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:11,167
Sir, all you need to do is
call in your authorization code.

401
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:12,900
(phone ringing)
That's all the information
you need on him.

402
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,434
Yeah, Dan.

403
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,601
Mr. Lennox, the President
has asked to see you.

404
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:22,601
Okay, tell the President
I will be with him in a moment.

405
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,034
Sir, our man will be here
within the hour.

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,434
Call me when you're done
with the President.

407
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,534
Tom, come in.

408
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:48,501
You asked to see me, sir?

409
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:50,534
Yes, I'd like to hear
your thoughts about something.

410
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,134
My thoughts on what, sir?

411
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,467
Assad's speech.

412
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,234
He's going live
in less than one hour,

413
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,967
and before I give him
my thoughts,

414
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:59,234
I wanted to hear yours.

415
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,134
Is there a problem?

416
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:05,534
Uh, no, sir, it's just...
What?

417
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:09,800
I assumed you were no longer
interested in my opinion, sir.

418
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,434
Tom, I still value
your judgment,

419
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:16,234
and if I've made you feel
otherwise, I apologize.

420
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:23,100
All right, sir.

421
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,501
How much longer?

422
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,234
I'm not sure.

423
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,201
I have to recalculate
the profile

424
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,700
for two of the target cities.
Hurry.

425
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't want to be
exposed like this

426
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,601
any longer than necessary.

427
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,167
You think the authorities know
we're working with Fayed?

428
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,967
If they don't, they will soon.

429
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,434
WOMAN (harried):
I was in my kitchen
when I saw the flash.

430
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:03,034
I turned to look out my window,
and it just exploded,

431
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
all the windows.

432
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,568
There was glass everywhere.

433
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:11,668
And then there was this sound.

434
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,167
It was so loud.

435
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,501
Oh, man.

436
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:17,668
Hell of a day, huh?

437
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,568
Yeah, you could say that.

438
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,534
Can I get you anything else?
No.

439
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,700
Yeah.

440
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,201
Whiskey. Plain, single malt.

441
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,167
What kind?

442
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,467
That kind.

443
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,267
This?
Yeah.

444
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,501
And these.
Okay.

445
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,568
(register drawer opening)

446
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,700
Your change?
Keep it.

447
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,634
(grunts)

448
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,867
(sobbing)

449
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:14,267
(retching)

450
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,534
(phone rings)

451
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:35,967
MORRIS:
I'm on my way.

452
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,100
From where?

453
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,301
I told you, I went out
for a walk.

454
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,867
The Tac Team is about
to move in on Gredenko.

455
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,434
I need you at
your station.

456
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,767
I'm on my way.

457
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,767
Morris...

458
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:54,234
(sobbing)

459
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,601
Come with me.

460
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,267
I want you to put this on,
under your clothes.

461
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,767
It's just a precaution.

462
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,833
(frustrated grunt)

463
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:52,767
My hands are shaking.

464
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,700
Here.

465
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:58,201
I'm going to do everything
I can to get him back.

466
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:01,301
He's the only reason
I stayed with Graem...

467
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:05,134
He was the only good thing
I had left since...

468
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,134
You ready?

469
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:13,534
Yeah.
Let's go.

470
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,700
Get out.

471
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,733
(grunts)

472
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,668
You do exactly
what I tell you.

473
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,134
You understand me?

474
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,601
--Hey, Milo?

475
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,200
Hey.

476
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,467
How are you
holding up?

477
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:05,434
(groans)... They say
I'm going to be okay.

478
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:11,133
(sighs) It's...

479
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,467
So what happened?

480
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,300
I was stupid.

481
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,400
They don't pay me to be
a field agent.

482
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:17,734
Well, maybe
they should,

483
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,133
because, uh...
you protected Marilyn Bauer.

484
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,467
That's what I heard.

485
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:23,567
I had no idea
what I was doing.

486
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:26,634
The whole thing
just happened so fast.

487
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:29,901
You don't have to downplay
it to make me fell better.

488
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,068
You don't have
to do that.

489
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,934
Okay.

490
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,367
Uh...

491
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:38,167
Hey.

492
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,434
You okay?

493
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,867
Yeah.

494
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:43,233
Well done.

495
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,400
Thanks.

496
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:52,133
I'm going to push Assad
to make these changes.

497
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,400
Your suggestions are
all excellent, Tom.

498
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,801
Oh? Just doing my job,
Mr. President.

499
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,400
I'd like you to be there
when he delivers this.

500
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,467
I will be, sir.

501
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:01,601
If you'll excuse me,

502
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,167
I have a briefing
with Senator Benson.

503
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:04,500
Of course, Tom.

504
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,934
(phone beeps)
Melinda?

505
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,200
I have some notes that need
to be taken to Assad.

506
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,767
MELINDA (over intercom):
Yes, Mr. President.

507
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:26,133
(quietly):
What did the president want?

508
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,934
He asked me to review
Assad's speech.

509
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:30,934
Which he'll never get
the chance to deliver.

510
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,601
Listen, sir... you need
to authorize that clearance.

511
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,701
Our man will be here
any minute.
It's in the works.

512
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,100
It's just taking a while
to complete the authorization.

513
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,968
<i>All right, well, we need it
before he's here.</i>

514
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:41,901
I will call security again.

515
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:44,567
I will phone you back
if there's any problem.

516
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:46,634
Meanwhile,
go meet with him.

517
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,300
This is Tom Lennox.

518
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:55,601
I need to speak to the ranking
Secret Service agent on site.

519
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,068
MAN (over phone):
Agent Hollister.

520
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,667
Agent Hollister,
this is Tom Lennox.

521
00:25:58,734 --> 00:25:59,901
I need to see you immediately.

522
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:01,701
Yes, sir.
I can meet you

523
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,601
as soon as I get someone
to man my position,

524
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,167
which should be
in about 15 minutes.

525
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,167
No, that's not soon enough.
I've got something to show you.

526
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,300
Where are you right now?

527
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,034
"B" Wing, room 17.

528
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,601
I'm on my way.

529
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:15,767
(groans)

530
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,901
Carson wondered
if you were playing us.

531
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:19,500
He said that he didn't want
to bring you into this,

532
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,100
but I defended you!

533
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,567
I said that
we could trust you.

534
00:26:22,634 --> 00:26:23,901
I told him that you understood.

535
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:26,434
Nothing justifies the killing
of a president.

536
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,534
This president is giving us
no choice.

537
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,068
Don't do this.

538
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,901
(grunting):
It's already done.

539
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:42,601
(panting)

540
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:52,367
Yes, uh, this is Reed Pollock.

541
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:55,367
I have a message for Agent
Hollister from Mr. Lennox.

542
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:58,068
Yes. Could you please tell him
that the issue has been resolved

543
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,167
and that Mr. Lennox won't need
to meet with him.

544
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:02,200
MAN (over phone):
Yes, sir.
Okay. Thanks.

545
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:12,801
NADIA:
We just confirmed
Marilyn Bauer's intel.

546
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,434
The Glasgow house is owned
by a Russian shell corporation

547
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,300
that Gredenko has a hidden
interest in.

548
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,034
Is Turner's team in place?

549
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,200
They'll let me know
when they're ready to go.

550
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,434
Chloe,
lock satellite

551
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,434
and establish
a comm link.

552
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,434
Nadia.

553
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,534
(quietly):
Where were you? I told you
not to take too long.

554
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:31,100
Sorry.

555
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,601
Comm unit's operational,
but the backup module

556
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,133
needs to be reset.

557
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,968
You better go do it now; the
operation starts in two minutes.

558
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,167
(quietly):
Come with me.

559
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,434
Do you realize that after
everything we've been through

560
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
what a betrayal this is?

561
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,267
I was a little late.

562
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:01,934
Morris, I can smell it
on your breath.

563
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:05,534
Yes... I took a drink,

564
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,767
but I spat it out
straight away.

565
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,834
Please...
I swear.

566
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,100
Chloe, look at me.
Look at me.

567
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:16,801
I am stone-cold sober.

568
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,167
You're losing control.

569
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,701
You're placing other people's
lives in danger.

570
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,901
(sighs)

571
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:27,334
I'm going to have to tell
Buchanan.

572
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,834
After everything
that has happened...

573
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:34,133
(chuckles)...
something had to give.

574
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,534
The important thing is,

575
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:40,667
that I realized I didn't want
to throw everything away,

576
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:44,034
especially you,
especially you.

577
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,534
And I stopped myself,
and that is a little victory.

578
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,867
Right?

579
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:56,701
I swear, it will
never happen again.

580
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,400
Please don't tell Buchanan
because you're right--

581
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:03,334
me getting back to work
is the best medicine.

582
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,734
I'll be watching you
for the rest of the shift.

583
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,233
Fine.

584
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,200
Call your sponsor.

585
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,968
I will.

586
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,068
Turner's team is
taking final positions.

587
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:26,233
Chloe, open
the video link.

588
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,400
Hal, what's your status?

589
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,400
No sign of a lookout.

590
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,133
Windows are covered,
but we're good to go.

591
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,334
Commence at your discretion.

592
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,500
Ryan, is your team ready?

593
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,400
Yes, sir.

594
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:39,968
Okay, we're going in on three,

595
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:42,133
two, one.

596
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:06,500
Clear!

597
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:08,767
Clear!

598
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,901
Clear!

599
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,534
Clear!

600
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,500
First sweep,
all clear, sir.

601
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,334
Roger that.

602
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,667
TURNER (over link):
Mr. Buchanan, there no sign
of Gredenko or anyone.

603
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,601
Hal, as soon as you've
completed a full sweep,

604
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,667
process the place
for evidence.

605
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:27,767
Yes, sir.

606
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:30,068
Chloe, text Jack's
cell phone,

607
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,767
tell him we don't have Gredenko.

608
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:40,300
(panting)

609
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:45,300
(phone vibrating)

610
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,034
Hold up here.

611
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,367
What's wrong?

612
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,601
It's nothing.

613
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,534
Don't even think about
trying to warn my father.

614
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,100
Once he sees that you
brought me here,

615
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,034
he's more likely
to shoot you than I am.

616
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,867
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

617
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,300
Both of you
go up to the door.

618
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:08,001
You knock; when he let's you in,
I'll follow.

619
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,167
Let's go.

620
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,167
Marilyn, get back.

621
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:18,001
Open the door.

622
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,001
Now, go.

623
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,801
Where the hell is
my father?

624
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,567
I don't know,
I swear.

625
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,867
Where's Josh?

626
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:45,567
Marilyn, just stay calm.

627
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:48,500
Put these on.

628
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,233
(phone rings)

629
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,467
Answer it;
put it on speaker.

630
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,367
Hello?

631
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,334
PHILLIP:
Hello, Marilyn.

632
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,901
Jack, even when you were young,

633
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:01,934
I learned never
to underestimate you.

634
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,167
I didn't want to hurt Josh.

635
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,001
You've forced my hand.

636
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:08,200
Take a look out the window,
the adjacent roof.

637
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,334
(gasps)

638
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,034
Oh, Phillip,
please don't!

639
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,867
JACK:
Dad...

640
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,367
you only have
one play left here,

641
00:32:21,434 --> 00:32:24,367
that's to try and cut a deal
with the government.

642
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:26,200
Explain your connection
to the nuke; tell them

643
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,834
you'll try and help them in
exchange for immunity.

644
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:30,634
Right now that is
your only option.

645
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,701
You pull that trigger
and that option is gone.

646
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,068
Do you understand me? Gone.

647
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,701
I'm no fool, Jack.

648
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,534
They're never going
to give me immunity

649
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:38,934
after everything
I've done.

650
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,534
You don't know that.
You don't know that for sure!

651
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,233
Right now they are desperate.

652
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,901
But either way, for you,
this is over.

653
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:46,334
Dad, it's over!

654
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
There is no empire to protect.

655
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,068
There's no legacy left.

656
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:53,267
There is Marilyn, Josh and me;
that's it.

657
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,300
Please, Dad.

658
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,767
I know you don't want
to hurt Josh.

659
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:03,267
I'm the one you want.

660
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:09,567
You let Josh go...
I will surrender.

661
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:13,500
Come alone, unarmed,

662
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,767
and I'll let Josh go.

663
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,968
But if you bring anyone else
into this,

664
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:19,701
I will kill him.

665
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,068
I understand.

666
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,667
Hang up the phone.

667
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,601
(speed dialing)

668
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,434
WOMAN (over phone):
CTU.
This is Jack Bauer.

669
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,034
I need you to send a team
over to the Grandmont Hotel

670
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,334
to pick up a hostile.

671
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,701
He's been secured.

672
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,801
He's in room 2132.

673
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,634
Jack?

674
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:09,400
--Hey, I need to talk to you.

675
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:10,934
About what?

676
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,134
Morris.

677
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,867
Not here.

678
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:17,301
Look, he came and saw
me in the infirmary...

679
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:19,034
Look, I know he's been
a little shaky.

680
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,634
Has he been drinking?

681
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,368
You smelled it on his breath?

682
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,867
Yeah.
I did, too.

683
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,034
I already talked
to him about it.

684
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:26,167
He didn't metabolize
the alcohol.

685
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,101
He didn't metabolize
the alcohol?

686
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,134
I know it sounds weird,
but it's true.

687
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,268
He took a drink
and he spit it back out.

688
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:33,368
How do you know?

689
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:35,067
Because he told me.
And you believe him?

690
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't have
to believe him.

691
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:39,167
I was married to him-- if he
was drunk, I would know.

692
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:40,400
He's not drunk.

693
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:41,800
He's been sober
for three years.

694
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:47,734
I didn't know he
was an alcoholic.

695
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,533
Now you know.

696
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,834
And you don't think Buchanan
should know about this?

697
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:55,800
No. If he slips up again,
I will personally tell Buchanan.

698
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,800
Let's just leave it for now.

699
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,834
Okay.

700
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:07,334
Okay. I want you to wait here
for Josh.

701
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,667
Do you think your father
will keep his word?

702
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:12,368
As long as I keep mine.

703
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:13,533
You know how to use this?

704
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,767
Point and shoot.

705
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,600
Once I get Josh,
do you want me to call CTU

706
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,201
and tell them
to send help?
No.

707
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,767
I need to take care
of this myself.

708
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,734
Jack...

709
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,934
thank you.

710
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,901
Everything's going
to be all right.

711
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,400
Just wait here.

712
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:54,767
I'm unarmed!

713
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:19,834
Dad!

714
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:23,834
I'm unarmed!

715
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,334
Come out! I am unarmed!

716
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,001
PHILLIP:
That's close enough.

717
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,767
Turn around.

718
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:47,268
Now show me that you're not
wearing an ankle holster.

719
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:04,767
Take one step toward me
for every step Josh takes away.

720
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,101
Josh.

721
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,167
Slowly.

722
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,667
Your mother's waiting for you
in the stairwell

723
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:26,901
around the corner. Go. Go!

724
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:36,167
That's it.

725
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,767
Oh, Josh!

726
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,634
Oh, God...

727
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,234
Are you okay?

728
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,368
Are you okay?
Let's go.

729
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:46,034
Go.

730
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:58,834
I never meant
for this to happen, Jack.

731
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,268
I didn't have a choice.

732
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:05,134
I don't know how exactly,
but Gredenko found out

733
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,001
about my role in David Palmer's
assassination.

734
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,767
So... he blackmailed me,

735
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,167
forced me to cooperate.

736
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,967
So it was Gredenko who had you
divert some of the bombs

737
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:18,268
the company was responsible
for destroying?

738
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:21,667
He's a radical nationalist.

739
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:25,134
Told me that he wanted
to preserve some of the arsenal

740
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:29,101
for the day when the Soviet
Union would be reestablished.

741
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:32,767
I believed him because I had to.

742
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:35,734
When did you find out
he sold the bombs to Fayed?

743
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,034
Not until one of the bombs
was detonated in Valencia.

744
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,734
That's the truth?!

745
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,433
Absolutely.

746
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,734
I've been looking for Gredenko
ever since.

747
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,067
So that I could find out
what he knew about Fayed,

748
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,700
and stop all this.

749
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,934
I'm a patriot, Jack.

750
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:54,800
I never wanted any harm
to come to this country.

751
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,500
You want to lie to yourself,
you go ahead,

752
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,301
but stop lying to me!

753
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,667
You let all of this happen

754
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,500
just so you could cover up
what you did!

755
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:06,201
(wry chuckle)

756
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:09,667
You have all the smarts
that Graem never had.

757
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:12,967
You'd have handled
Gredenko before this
all got out of control.

758
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,167
You know, none of this
would have happened

759
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:17,901
if you hadn't turned your back
on me.

760
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:23,001
So that you could become--
what?--

761
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:25,600
a civil servant.

762
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,967
So...

763
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,467
your people will use Gredenko
to find this terrorist,

764
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:35,101
and the truth will come out
about all I've done.

765
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,167
We never got Gredenko.

766
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:41,268
Then all this was for nothing.

767
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:45,268
On your knees.

768
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,567
I didn't have to end
like this, Jack.

769
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:55,834
(gun chamber clicks)

770
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:58,533
You could've had it all.

771
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,567
I want you to know...

772
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,334
...I never wanted you to feel

773
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,368
like I had turned my back
on you.

774
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:13,500
That I had turned my back
on the family.

775
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,567
I just had to go my own way.

776
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:27,334
Do things for myself. I...

777
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,001
It was never good enough
for you.

778
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:34,767
I'm sorry.

779
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,767
Anyway...

780
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm ready.

781
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:47,934
What are you waiting for?

782
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:50,567
Do it!

783
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:52,700
Damn you!

784
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,567
(phone rings)

785
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,301
Yes?

786
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,533
My name is Jack Bauer.
Who am I talking to?

787
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,901
You must've exhausted all
your options to find Gredenko.

788
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,400
Who is this?

789
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,834
It's Charles Logan, Jack.

790
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:51,234
I might be able to help you, but
we need to talk face-to-face.

791
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,567
Where are you?

792
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,001
I'm near the airport.

793
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:56,268
Good, you're local.

794
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,467
CTU knows where I am.

795
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,567
Come and see me, Jack,

796
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:03,700
as soon as possible

797
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,500
And come alone.

798
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,567
I'm looking forward to it.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
