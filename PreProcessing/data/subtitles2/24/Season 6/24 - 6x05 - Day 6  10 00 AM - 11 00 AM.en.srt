2
00:00:10,473 --> 00:00:12,206
<i>Previously on</i> 24.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,196
This was the last model
the Soviets produced.

4
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:17,157
Is this what you need
to reprogram the trigger?

5
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:18,262
Yes.

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,414
So in a little less than an hour,

7
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:21,861
it will detonate

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,657
and strike a blow
that the Americans will never forget.

9
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:26,676
When you're finished,
meet me at the safe house.

10
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:30,715
I think some people in this place have
a connection with the terrorist attacks.

11
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,189
How would you know that?

12
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,589
There was one phrase
they used several times.

13
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:38,151
"Khamsa ziwar."

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,704
Pass that on to the FBI.

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,131
I've just approved
the written agreement with Assad.

16
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,816
<i>I'm prepared
to offer you full protection</i>

17
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:46,591
and a pardon for all crimes
or acts of war in the past.

18
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,019
<i>Is that acceptable to you?</i>

19
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:50,230
I need to see this pardon in writing.

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,921
<i>You were right about Curtis and Assad
having a past connection.</i>

21
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:55,336
Curtis was in the army
just after Desert Storm.

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,845
<i>His squad was embushed
by Assad's people.</i>

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,068
They killed 5 of Curtis's men
and took 2 more hostage.

24
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,751
Assad's Lieutenant
personally beheaded them both.

25
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,309
Oh my God!

26
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:07,661
You still don't remember?

27
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,518
Special Forces battalion...

28
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:14,975
Curtis, put your weapon down!

29
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,568
Stay out of it, Jack!

30
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:17,733
I can't.

31
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:19,990
I gave him my word
that we would protect him.

32
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,161
I can't let this animal live.

33
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:28,277
<i>Curtis didn't leave you any choice.</i>

34
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,934
That's what
I keep trying to tell myself.

35
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,524
We're gonna find that suitcase nuke
because of you.

36
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:37,785
Tell the President I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.

37
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:41,452
We believe we've found
the suitcase nuke.

38
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,643
The tac team is ready.

39
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,140
Do it now!
Do it!

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,837
I just got a message from the FBI.

41
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,739
It's some Arabic phrase.

42
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:06,255
Khamsa ziwar.

43
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,512
It means "five visitors".

44
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,214
Assad said
"visitor" was a code word for "weapon".

45
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,900
Four more of theses things
are out there.

46
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,581
<i>The unthinkable has happened.</i>

47
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:30,403
<i>Terrorists have exploded
a nuclear weapon on our soil.</i>

48
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:33,992
<i>Over one square mile of Valencia,
a suburb of Los Angeles,</i>

49
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,678
<i>has been destroyed
by the most devastating attack</i>

50
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:40,904
<i>in a series of terrorists activities
that began eleven weeks ago.</i>

51
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:45,780
<i>And one can only imagine the cost
in lives and the suffering of survivors.</i>

52
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,760
<i>Judging from the direction
in which the mushroom cloud is heading,</i>

53
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:52,522
<i>winds from the South
may be blowing the airborne radiation</i>

54
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,194
<i>away from the more
heavily populated area zone.</i>

55
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,546
How many people died in this?

56
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:00,936
Initial estimate :
no less from 12.000.

57
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,483
Mr. President, I just got off the phone
with Bill Buchanan at CTU.

58
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,207
He has intel that four more
tactical nuclear weapons

59
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,645
were stolen
along with the one that went off.

60
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:18,721
Do we have any idea where they are?

61
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,416
We do not.

62
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:23,827
I want a meeting with the Joints Chiefs,
Tom, right away.

63
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:24,936
I've already let them know.

64
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,772
Has the civilian air traffic
been shut down?

65
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:30,418
Yes, the FAA gave the order as soon as
they were informed about the bomb.

66
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,018
Mr. President.

67
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:36,265
Given the current situation, we decided
to move you down to the bunker.

68
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,341
Alright.

69
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:40,836
But Tom, I have to get in front
of the American people.

70
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,525
Ellen, I want to make
a televise speech within the hour.

71
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,411
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, let's go David.

72
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:05,405
<i>The Department of Emergency Services
and Public Safety</i>

73
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,616
<i>are urging everyone to return home.</i>

74
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:11,726
<i>We'll have an expert in nuclear physics
in our program in just a few minutes.</i>

75
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:12,830
Nadia.

76
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,744
Have we heard from any
of the secondary teams

77
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:16,117
that were converging on Fayed?

78
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,147
We lost communication
as soon as the blast hit.

79
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,881
Milo, can you get a visual?

80
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,995
I just checked the satellite. All...

81
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,737
All of our field teams were too close
to ground zero. They're all dead.

82
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,433
What was the last thing
you heard from them?

83
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,939
They were engaged with the hostiles.

84
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,789
Which means they were
closing in on Fayed.

85
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:36,363
We need to know if he was in the radius
when the bomb went off.

86
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,563
Absolutely.

87
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,658
Mr. President...

88
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:41,499
your office has been prepared.

89
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:44,376
The continuity of operations plan
has also been activated.

90
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,747
The Vice President has been alerted,
and is following protocol.

91
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,994
The Joint Chiefs,
and most of the Cabinet members

92
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,499
are on they way here.

93
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,413
Remaining Cabinet members
have been routed to site-R.

94
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,165
Right this way, sir.

95
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,982
Bill ? Are you alright?

96
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,710
<i>We're upwind of the blast</i>.
We're fine. What's going on over there?

97
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,525
Secret Services moved us
down to the bunker

98
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,868
and the President is about to meet
with the Joint Chiefs.

99
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,135
Do you have anything new?

100
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,259
Here is what we know.

101
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,906
The bomb went off as we were
moving in on Fayed's safe house.

102
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,112
Do you think their presence
prompted the detonation?

103
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,175
It could have.

104
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,574
It's possible they were just
prepping the bomb in Valencia

105
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,725
and hoping to move it
to a more populated area.

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,164
Is there any chance
that Fayed could still be alive

107
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:40,040
and have those four other bombs?

108
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,687
We don't know.
We're running the intel, now.

109
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:45,049
- And what about Assad?
- He's on his way here.

110
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,190
We're hopping he can help us find Fayed.

111
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,418
Alright, keep me in the loop.
And Bill, please...

112
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,304
- be careful.
- I will.

113
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:00,922
It's a lot to process.

114
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,616
It's so many people!

115
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:05,582
Yeah.

116
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:08,394
And Curtis? I can't believe this.

117
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,660
I know you and him were friends.

118
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:13,794
Why do people I know keep dying?

119
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,004
Did you find anything about Fayed?

120
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:20,839
No, we're still
repositioning satellites.

121
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,233
We don't know where he is, yet.

122
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:25,958
We got massive packet lost.
Do you want to help me boot up routers?

123
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:27,567
Who wouldn't?

124
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,380
Open etudes five.

125
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,018
I have a very bad feeling
about everything.

126
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,274
Do you know, Jack quit?

127
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,341
Yeah, Buchanan said he's off channel.
What's that all about?

128
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:46,318
I'm sure it's because
he was forced to kill Curtis.

129
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,877
You know I'm here for you, alright?

130
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,868
Yeah, I do.

131
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:18,227
Over here!

132
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,768
The authorities discovered our location.

133
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,749
The bomb never reached its target.

134
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:38,365
Damn'it, Fayed!

135
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:39,775
I sold those weapons to you.

136
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:43,022
The least you could have done was warn
me before you blow them up in my city!

137
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,032
I told you it was not supposed to happen
the way it happened.

138
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,216
It's a little late for apologies,
don't you think?

139
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,747
My engineer died in the blast.

140
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,954
The device used to reprogram the trigger
was destroyed as well.

141
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:54,268
And that's my problem, why?

142
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:57,529
I have four more bombs whose triggers
need to be made operational.

143
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,003
Sorry, Fayed.

144
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,098
I'm going to Vegas.

145
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:02,946
Find me a way, McCarthy.

146
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:06,546
I'll pay you more. Double the amount
from our previous transaction.

147
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,342
That's interesting.

148
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:13,192
You need someone who could replicate
what that device did.

149
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,696
With modern equipment.

150
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,820
We're talking pretty advanced stuff.
I'd have to do some checking.

151
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:19,820
Do you know someone who can do this?

152
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,872
Even if I find someone who can, I doubt
they will, this is over the line.

153
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:26,266
I don't care,
how you get them to comply.

154
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,971
I need someone
within the next few hours.

155
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:31,070
Are you in, or not?

156
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,050
I'll do some research
and get back to you.

157
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:48,701
Help!
Somebody, help!

158
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,158
Look, I can get through the 911!

159
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:53,853
Could you... help!
I need a doctor!

160
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,491
I need a doctor!

161
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:56,920
Sorry, get out of my way!

162
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,720
Please, our helicopter,
it went down.

163
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,310
And there're two others.
One's dead,

164
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,367
one's incouncious.
I don't know what to do. Please

165
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:04,605
Please, help me!

166
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,044
I'm sorry, show me.

167
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:14,925
I don't even remember
anything hitting us.

168
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:16,259
It went out of control.

169
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,973
You were hit by a shockwave.

170
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,450
A shockwave of what?

171
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:21,221
Nuclear bomb.

172
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:49,693
Do you hear me?

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,826
Can you hear me?

174
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,397
Chuck, is that you?

175
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,702
Yeah, I brought help.
We're getting you out of here!

176
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,683
Be careful, it's about to fall.

177
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,086
It's jammed.

178
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,725
Ready?

179
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,049
One... two... three.

180
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,200
Go!

181
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,957
Stay here!

182
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:41,543
Are you okay?

183
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,971
I think so.

184
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,368
This guy says it's a nuclear bomb.

185
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,520
It's Valencia. It's where I live.

186
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,425
My wife and kids are there...

187
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,086
You can't go back to Valencia,
the radiation will kill you.

188
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,410
Jeff, don't, you'll die!

189
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,716
- <i>CTU.</i>
- It's Jack Bauer.

190
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,525
- Let me speak to Buchanan.
<i>Right away.</i>

191
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,066
If you want to save your friend,
don't let him go back home.

192
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,085
<i>- Jack, you're alright?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

193
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,390
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm still in Granada Hills.</i>

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,939
Good, you're upwind of the blast.
Don't go any further North.

195
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:17,291
- How bad is it?
<i>- It took out a square mile.</i>

196
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,920
Do we know if this was Fayed's endgame?

197
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,995
It wasn't.

198
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,614
There're four more nukes out there.

199
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,471
You need to pick me up.

200
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,994
You said you were out?

201
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:28,057
Not after this.

202
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,343
Alright, tell me where you are.
<i>I'll send a car.</i>

203
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,142
I am at the corner
of Glasgow and 15th.

204
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,266
We'll be there.

205
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:52,720
Colonel, Fayed has to be at
least partially state-supported.

206
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,351
Have your guys identified a country?

207
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,754
<i>Not yet, sir.</i>

208
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,483
<i>CIA has narrowed down the list.</i>

209
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,617
<i>It's on your screen
in the short brief section.</i>

210
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,242
Have you been in touch
with the ambassadors of these countries?

211
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,750
<i>Yes, sir.
They all extend their condolences</i>

212
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,084
<i>and have, of course,
disavowed any role in the attacks.</i>

213
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,750
Well, we know at least
one of them's lying.

214
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:12,319
Maybe all of them.

215
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,681
I'm not sure we know that, John.

216
00:12:14,874 --> 00:12:17,117
But let's say it is true--
what are you suggesting?

217
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:21,693
We have carriers on standby
in the Persian Gulf.

218
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,384
They have the capability
of striking multiple targets

219
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,654
in each of these states.

220
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:27,984
We've been playing games
with these terrorists

221
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,302
for 11 weeks now.

222
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,850
The only language
they understand is force.

223
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,117
So let's speak it to them real clearly.

224
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:37,050
I guarantee you that if each
of these countries had to sustain

225
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,798
three major metropolitan nuclear
strikes, they'd no longer

226
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:42,981
have the time or the resources
to play in our sandbox anymore.

227
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:44,925
These people want to live
in the Stone Age--

228
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,377
I say let's put them there.

229
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,660
Admiral, I am very sure
that your emotions

230
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,639
are shared by many in this room

231
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:54,180
- and across this country...
- These are not just emotions.

232
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:57,017
- Our duty demands we defend...
- The President is talking, Admiral.

233
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,284
Do not interrupt.

234
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,493
We will retaliate, Admiral.

235
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,919
But we will do so,
sir, carefully

236
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,432
and with our sights locked
on our enemy and only our enemy.

237
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,136
Karen, what has CTU learned
about the remaining weapons?

238
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:17,304
They're assessing the initial
satellite intel and forensic data.

239
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,829
So what <i>do</i> we know?

240
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,866
We're assuming that the bomb was meant

241
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,202
to be detonated in a more populated area

242
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,984
and was only
being assembled in Valencia.

243
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,388
By the scientist that I released.

244
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,269
Yes.

245
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,314
The scientist was killed in the blast,

246
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,859
and CTU is trying to determine
where Fayed was at the time.

247
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,691
The worst-case scenario

248
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,563
is that he is still alive

249
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:42,151
and in possession of
the remaining nuclear weapons.

250
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,029
Tell them we're safe.

251
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,804
That we're moving away from it now.

252
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,719
Mr. Buchanan,
this is Hamri Al-Assad.

253
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,430
Mr. Buchanan's Director of CTU.

254
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:29,438
Mr. Buchanan, I know
that you see me as your enemy.

255
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,684
But today...

256
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:33,712
I assure you I am not.

257
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,465
Follow me.

258
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,327
There. All right?

259
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:55,777
Why are we going out of our way
treating Assad,

260
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:58,033
one of the most violent
terrorists of our time,

261
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,248
like a VIP?

262
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:00,483
No holding room.

263
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,351
Audience with the White House? Sure.

264
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,579
How would you like your mineral water,
Mr. Assad, room temp?

265
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,184
Please have a seat.

266
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,450
Ready?

267
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,363
Bill Buchanan,
Director of CTU, Los Angeles.

268
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:34,307
I'm here with Hamri Al-Assad.

269
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:37,287
Less than 30 minutes ago,
Abu Fayed detonated

270
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:38,867
a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.

271
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,803
We have reason to believe
he's still at large

272
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:43,190
with four more tactical
nuclear weapons in his possession.

273
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,920
- Four?
- That's right.

274
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,004
Please, you must understand.

275
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,507
I came to the United States
to <i>stop</i> Fayed--

276
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,030
I knew he intended to inflict
damage, but I did not know

277
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:54,803
he was in possession
of nuclear weapons.

278
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,182
But he is.

279
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,396
Which means there has to be a trail.

280
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,278
There had to have been many people
involved in the planning of this.

281
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,205
This attack was planned
after Fayed betrayed me six months ago.

282
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:06,580
When he learned of your intention
to broker a peace plan?

283
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:08,159
Which I still intend to do.

284
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,735
But you knew Fayed was coming
to the United States.

285
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,793
This information came to me
only days before

286
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,758
- the first attacks began.
- From whom?

287
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,427
I am a well-informed man, Mr. Buchanan.

288
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,884
Are there any other paths
you can think of

289
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,682
- that can lead us to Fayed?
- Yes.

290
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,097
The source.

291
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,936
- The source of the bomb.
- About a year ago

292
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,231
I sent Fayed to negotiate
with an ex-Soviet General

293
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,623
about the cache
of tactical nuclear weapons.

294
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:36,591
But there was
no transaction at the time.

295
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:38,133
What was the name of the General?

296
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:39,457
Dmitri Gredenko.

297
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,216
Can you tell me anything
about Gredenko?

298
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,561
Nothing. Nothing.

299
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,013
I've never met the man.

300
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,565
Continue questioning him.
I'm gonna check this out.

301
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,965
Gredenko. You got that, Chloe?

302
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,762
Yeah,
I'm opening a Russian database now.

303
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,712
Let me know what you find out, Chloe.

304
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,564
Wait, what's this file
with Gredenko's name on it?

305
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:09,507
It's a link we're using
as a match basis, Milo.

306
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,852
- Mind your own business.
- I know, I understand that.

307
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:15,525
I just compiled a list of names,
people in L.A.

308
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,148
who had contact with Gredenko

309
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,534
on business channels.

310
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,346
- That's a lot of names.
- Yes. But one of them

311
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,716
kind of floated to the top,
if you know what I mean.

312
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,677
Put it on Buchanan's screen.

313
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,844
Yes, yes, they'll fly him up.

314
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,000
All right.

315
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,369
Morris just put something
on your B window.

316
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,199
Gredenko contacts. Good.

317
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,715
Look at number 17.

318
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,178
Chairman of BXJ Technologies.

319
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:54,890
Phillip Bauer.

320
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,710
Jack's father.

321
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:02,032
Did you get anything more specific?

322
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,594
No. BXJ does a lot of business
in Eastern Europe.

323
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,703
This could be
a purely coincidental linkage.

324
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:07,899
Yeah, what if it's not?

325
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,956
Most of their contracts are highly
confidential, but I'll look into it.

326
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,771
- You calling Jack?
- Yeah.

327
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,513
<i>- This is Bauer.</i>
- Jack, Assad just gave us

328
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,094
<i>the name of a Russian General</i>

329
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:22,449
Fayed contacted a year ago
about the nukes.

330
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,784
<i>The general's name is Gredenko.
Do you know him?</i>

331
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,110
It turns out your father does.

332
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:30,535
My father?

333
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,884
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Gredenko did business

334
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:35,614
with BXJ Technologies,
specifically with your father.

335
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:38,166
- What kind of business?
- We don't know.

336
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,049
That's why we want to talk to him.

337
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,307
Bill, I don't understand--
is my father a suspect?

338
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,314
No. His name came up
on a list of people

339
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,364
who have had contact with Gredenko.

340
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,761
We're gonna question him.

341
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:50,516
I wanted to check with you first to see
if you could shed any light.

342
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,776
I haven't spoken to him
for over nine years.

343
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,173
All right, we'll send
someone over to talk to him.

344
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:58,411
Bill, wait.

345
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,781
I should do this.

346
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:02,551
Jack, we can run this.

347
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,045
You don't have enough time.

348
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:06,031
He'll talk to me if I go alone.

349
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:09,730
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

350
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,112
<i>All right, tell Stokes
we'll pick him up-- you take the car.</i>

351
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,559
<i>- Let me know what you find out.</i>
- Thanks, Bill.

352
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,299
You need to pull over.

353
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:30,177
Yes, he is,
but I don't know exac...

354
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,397
The FBI's here.
I got to go.

355
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:34,996
Why did they send you?

356
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,466
Believe me, Miss Palmer, I didn't want
to arrest you or your friend.

357
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:41,456
This is Agent Jennings.
He'll be working this with me.

358
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,869
Well, what exactly will you be doing?

359
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,783
Walid overheard
some conversations about the bombs.

360
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,555
He heard a <i>fragment</i> of a conversation.

361
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:52,598
If there is an active cell
inside that detention facility,

362
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:54,456
we need Walid to find out more.

363
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,784
Agent Jennings
will be putting a wire on him.

364
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:58,902
Putting a wire on him?

365
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,011
I thought you were gonna be replacing
him with an undercover operative.

366
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:04,082
Walid isn't trained
to do something like this.

367
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:06,292
Well, he's already in place.

368
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,577
He's established a confidence.

369
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:11,901
How will you be putting a wire on him?

370
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,787
Just... let us do our job.

371
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,740
Have you heard anything more?

372
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:38,943
About what?

373
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,573
About what's going on out there.

374
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:42,773
How would I know that?

375
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:43,958
I thought...

376
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,299
I was just wondering if you...
knew anything.

377
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,370
No more than you, my brother.

378
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,547
I'm sorry, I have to get back.

379
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,956
Sure.

380
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,145
Walid Al-Rezani.

381
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:07,690
Yes?

382
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:09,055
You and I have to talk.

383
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:10,433
About what?

384
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,590
You don't ask the questions,
you son of a bitch.

385
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:13,710
I do.

386
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:28,002
Get out.

387
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,553
<i>We know who you're involved with.</i>

388
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:36,030
<i>I told your people,
I work for the IAA.</i>

389
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:37,619
I'm not involved in any kind

390
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:38,872
of terrorist activities.

391
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,444
- You're lying!
- I'm no terrorist.

392
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:41,597
<i>You're lying!</i>

393
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:43,491
What's he doing to him?

394
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:44,644
<i>What do you know?!</i>

395
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,678
Don't worry. He's not going to hurt him.
It's just for show.

396
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,770
That doesn't sound just for show.

397
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:50,837
Miss Palmer,

398
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:53,421
I advised you to leave.
If you want to stay,

399
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:55,096
keep your comments to yourself.

400
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,473
You're gonna explain to us
what we found in your wallet.

401
00:21:58,538 --> 00:21:59,717
What are you talking about?

402
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,070
You know damn well
what we're talking about!

403
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:08,320
He's wiring you.
It's a two-way radio.

404
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:09,717
Now, you're gonna tell me

405
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:12,034
what we found in your wallet.
You understand me?

406
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:13,734
What do you know about this guy?

407
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:18,678
This is ridiculous.

408
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:20,173
Sit down.

409
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,566
<i>Tell me now, or I'll take you
to the interrogation room.</i>

410
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,765
- You don't want that.
- I'm not telling you anything.

411
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:27,174
I don't care what you do to me.

412
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:28,370
You will.

413
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:31,015
You're gonna say
that I asked about this man.

414
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:33,583
You gotta make them believe
you're working for them.

415
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:36,380
I'll be back for you.

416
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,286
What did they do to you?

417
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,481
Nothing.

418
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:51,884
I'm fine.

419
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,165
They think they can do anything to us,

420
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,382
<i>those bastards.</i>

421
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,216
We've got a clear signal.

422
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,673
Sam, is that you?

423
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,594
Yes. Who's this?

424
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:18,870
It's Jack.

425
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:22,397
How are you, Sam?

426
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:23,996
We thought you were...

427
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:25,864
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

428
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:26,996
I'm in Los Angeles.

429
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,088
Listen, Sam,
I need to speak to my father.

430
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,978
It's really important. Is he there?

431
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:33,208
- No, he's not.
<i>- Where is he?</i>

432
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:35,784
He left yesterday
without telling me where he was going.

433
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,140
I haven't heard from him since.

434
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:38,506
Can I reach him on his cell?

435
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:39,684
He left it here.

436
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:41,898
I must admit,
it's all a bit mysterious.

437
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,284
I tried calling your brother.
He didn't know either.

438
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:47,917
Where is Gray?

439
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,318
<i>Well, he was at work earlier,
but who knows now?</i>

440
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:51,917
Can I get his cell number?

441
00:23:51,984 --> 00:23:53,569
Yeah. 818...

442
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,483
555-0175.

443
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:00,960
Okay, I got it.

444
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,178
Sam, listen to me.

445
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,810
If you speak to him, tell him
to get back to me at this number.

446
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,462
- Did it show up on your screen?
- Yes

447
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:07,709
It's really important.

448
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:11,367
I hope you find your father soon.

449
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:13,117
<i>I know he would want to talk with you.</i>

450
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,687
<i>He... regrets the way things
ended between the two of you.</i>

451
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,375
<i>Yeah, me, too.</i>

452
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,749
<i>Be well, Jack.</i>

453
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:23,554
<i>Thanks, Sam.</i>

454
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:32,821
Yeah.

455
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,059
It's Liddy.

456
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,017
You'll never guess
who just called here.

457
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:37,164
Who?

458
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,297
<i>Your brother, Jack.</i>

459
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:39,918
What are you talking about?

460
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,968
Jack's rotting away
in some Chinese prison.

461
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,790
No, actually he's here in L.A.

462
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:45,306
How the hell did that happen?

463
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:46,490
I don't know.

464
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,817
- What does he want?
- He's looking for the old man.

465
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,601
- Yeah, why?
- He didn't say.

466
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:54,318
But if I were you,
I'd expect a call from Jack.

467
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,027
Your name came up.

468
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:58,717
Damn it, we should have killed
Jack when we had the chance

469
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,600
instead of handing him over
to the Chinese.

470
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:01,727
We tried.

471
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:03,358
This isn't good.

472
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,483
My brother has a way of digging
things up that need to stay buried.

473
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,737
<i>It's me, Jack.</i>

474
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,999
Yeah.

475
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:31,323
Sam said you called,

476
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:33,048
but I didn't believe him.
Are you okay?

477
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,959
Yeah, I'm fine.
Is everyone safe over there?

478
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,238
Yeah, yeah, we're,
we're cool, Jack.

479
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,334
It's blowing my mind
hearing from you like this.

480
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:42,567
I want you to know that
when we found out that

481
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,834
you were in China, we tried
everything to get you out.

482
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,624
We called in a lot of favors.

483
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:47,893
Thanks.

484
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,559
How did you get out?

485
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:52,008
- Some sort of exchange.
- Yeah? For what?

486
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,161
I'm not really sure.

487
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,534
It must have been
one hell of an exchange.

488
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:57,440
Listen, Gray,
I'm working with CTU right now.

489
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:59,193
I'm trying to help them out
with something.

490
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:00,984
Yeah, Sam said that you were...

491
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:02,393
you were trying to find Dad?

492
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,564
Yeah. Where is he?

493
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,447
I don't know. He took off yesterday
without saying where he was going.

494
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,667
I assume he went to visit
one of his girlfriends.

495
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,768
One of them's really hot,
if you can believe that.

496
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:12,434
Why did he leave
without his cell phone?

497
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:14,857
I guess he just
didn't want to be bothered.

498
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,335
Gray, I need your help.

499
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:18,076
<i>I need to find him. It's important.</i>

500
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,590
Yeah, whatever you need, Jack.

501
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,398
I'll make a few phone calls.
Can I get back to you at this number?

502
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:24,305
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay. You got it.</i>

503
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:25,842
Thanks.

504
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:34,947
CTU. O'Brian.

505
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:36,911
Chloe, I need you
to help me find an address

506
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,746
<i>- Whose?</i>
- Graem Bauer.

507
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:40,897
- Your brother?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

508
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:42,931
It should be in my family file.

509
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:47,314
I haven't seen him in years.
Is he still in Malibu?

510
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:49,518
No, he's in Indian Falls.

511
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,892
226 Pine Crest Road.

512
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,123
Do you want his cell phone number?

513
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:57,965
I already have it.
I just talked to him.

514
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:00,801
Why didn't you ask him where he lives?

515
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:02,346
I'll get back to you.

516
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:07,409
<i>California Highway Patrol wants
to make it clear that it is essential</i>

517
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,467
<i>their emergency personnel be allowed</i>

518
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>to reach those injured in Valencia.</i>

519
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,433
<i>So, please keep the streets clear.</i>

520
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,322
<i>Once again, a nuclear bomb</i>

521
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,797
<i>has gone off in Valencia, California.</i>

522
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,031
- <i>The President</i>
- Dad.

523
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:21,017
<i>will adress the nation
within a half hour.</i>

524
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,935
You and your mom doing okay?

525
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:27,855
Yeah. I mean, on the news
they're talking about nuclear fallout.

526
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,070
We'll be fine.

527
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,066
Look, we're actually safer now.

528
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,212
They've made their big show in L.A.
with this nuke.

529
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,890
Whatever's gonna happen next,
it's gonna be in another city.

530
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:37,282
- Okay?
- Yeah.

531
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,003
Josh, I need to talk to your mom alone

532
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,576
- for a minute.
- All right.

533
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:55,051
I just got off the phone
with my brother, Jack.

534
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,904
How?
I thought the Chinese were holding him.

535
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:00,354
He's back in Los Angeles.

536
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,897
It's impossible.

537
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:04,866
Apparently not.

538
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,684
He's looking for Dad.

539
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,907
Is he coming here?

540
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:10,084
Why?

541
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,033
- Are you hoping he will?
- Don't go there, Gray.

542
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,852
We're already there.
I'm just looking for a little honesty.

543
00:28:16,624 --> 00:28:19,261
You weren't over Jack when
we got married, and you're still not.

544
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:21,584
Okay, how's this for a little honesty?

545
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,508
Insecurity in a grown man
is not attractive.

546
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:36,535
"The latest terrorist incident"?

547
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:38,684
This was a nuclear bomb!

548
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:40,384
Can we call it what it is?

549
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,424
We thought it would give the President
a little more flexibility.

550
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:46,415
Once you mention the word "nuclear,"
they're not gonna hear anything else.

551
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:48,675
No, actually, Ellen,
they will hear the truth.

552
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:50,983
Everybody in this country
knows what happened today.

553
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,876
And now they're looking for reassurances

554
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,280
that no matter how ugly

555
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,818
this thing is,
the President is in charge.

556
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,868
Listen.

557
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,771
We don't have any tangible leads

558
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:01,343
and confidence is low.

559
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:04,655
Now, if I go out there
and I lie to the American public

560
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,708
and tell them that we're on top of this,

561
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:09,129
and then some other bomb
goes off somewhere...

562
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:11,991
they won't believe a single word I say.
That can't happen.

563
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,833
I agree, sir, and that's why
I see an opportunity here.

564
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:15,916
Opportunity?

565
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:17,584
This bomb is going to remove

566
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:20,607
any remaining doubt
that we should be taking more aggressive

567
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,914
measures,
suspension of certain freedoms.

568
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,694
Internment, deportation.

569
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:27,124
Now is the time
to start hitting those topics.

570
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:28,527
Tom, you are counseling

571
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:30,703
that we embrace the politics of fear.

572
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:34,452
I am saying that we embrace reality.
We are afraid,

573
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:37,862
but if fear consolidates public support

574
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:41,271
for measures
that save our nation from extinction,

575
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,937
then you <i>bet,</i>
I'm in support of fear.

576
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:47,703
Tom, the people cannot be
any more afraid than they are now.

577
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:50,705
I would like this message
to have a calming effect.

578
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:54,284
Yes, we will call this a nuclear bomb,
because that is what it is,

579
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,648
but if we expect civil order
on those streets,

580
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:58,456
we cannot stoke the panic.

581
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:01,942
We're not gonna mention policy
in this speech.

582
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,532
The American public just needs to know
that every single member

583
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,840
of this administration
is working with the single

584
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:10,014
purpose of restoring order
and making our streets safe again.

585
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:17,362
I don't need a list of names.
I need one person who can do the job.

586
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:18,568
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

587
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,765
What took you so long?

588
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:34,050
Why couldn't you just pick me up
at my place, huh?

589
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:36,237
Instead of leaving me
on some street corner

590
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,050
looking like some hooker.

591
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:39,477
Just get in the car.

592
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:46,126
Do not...

593
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:47,492
talk to me...

594
00:30:47,935 --> 00:30:49,366
like one of your bimbos.

595
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:51,184
You got me?

596
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:54,336
They just

597
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,013
said on the news

598
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,187
that if the wind changes...

599
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,506
we're screwed.

600
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,417
I just want to get out of the city
and get to Vegas.

601
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:07,987
We're not going to Vegas.

602
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,190
Oh, no.
I'm not going to Palm Springs...

603
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,552
Again. No, no. That's where
you can just drop me off right here.

604
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,001
That place is like assisted living
for an entire city.

605
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,612
We're not going there either.

606
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,099
We have some things
we gotta do here first.

607
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,691
What are you talking about?

608
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:27,139
A nuclear bomb just went off,
like 25 miles from here.

609
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,920
I'm talking about a lot of money.

610
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,402
- Now, shut up.
- Darren.

611
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,651
Stop talking...

612
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:32,819
now!

613
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,789
Things are looking up.

614
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,078
- What does that mean?
<i>- It means</i>

615
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,422
I might be able to find someone
to do your dirty work.

616
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:46,560
How soon?

617
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:48,708
I expect to have some good news
within the hour.

618
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:50,611
Just make sure my money
is ready to wire.

619
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,024
The money is ready now.

620
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:56,223
McCarthy'll find someone for us.

621
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:59,406
Tell the men these bombs
will go off today

622
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:00,782
as scheduled.

623
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,352
Finished with Assad.
He gave me a few more names,

624
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,189
but nothing that he thought would help.

625
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:25,195
What else did he say?

626
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:26,787
He wants peace.

627
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:28,775
You believe him?

628
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,798
Yeah.

629
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:40,063
The President would like you
transported to Washington DC.

630
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:43,377
You'll be leaving out of Port Hueneme
on a military jet.

631
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,399
Some of the information
you gave us checked out.

632
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:49,995
Good luck here in Los Angeles.

633
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:51,607
I hope the worst is over.

634
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:52,756
Thank you.

635
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:15,080
Sir, the FBI
just upgraded one of their leads.

636
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:17,129
They're sending us live audio
we should monitor.

637
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,303
What kind of audio?

638
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:20,842
They've wired a guy
at the Anacostia Detention Facility.

639
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:23,396
They think one the detainees
may have information about Fayed.

640
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,779
Give it to Chloe. Make it a priority.

641
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:55,007
- Walid should not be doing this.
- He's going to be okay.

642
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:57,249
- That is not the point.
- This was his decision.

643
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:58,508
And it was the right one.

644
00:33:58,572 --> 00:34:00,885
Usually it takes
weeks or months to develop a cover.

645
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,215
He might be able
to find something out within hours.

646
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:06,100
If this works, he'll have done
a heroic thing for his country.

647
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:08,167
Please don't give me speeches, okay?

648
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,135
"If it works?" What if it doesn't?

649
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,056
What if they find out
he's wearing a wire?

650
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:14,869
The guards inside know what's going on.
They'll keep an eye on him.

651
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,618
- Right.
- You know, it's probably not

652
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,085
the best thing that you're here.

653
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,842
I've told you before--
Walid is my client.

654
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:21,083
I know what you told me,

655
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:23,496
and frankly
that carries no weight with the FBI.

656
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:25,567
Now let's be honest.

657
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:27,014
The only reason you're here,

658
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:28,700
is you're the President's sister.

659
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:31,410
Then you remember that
and we'll be fine.

660
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:34,717
You don't have any trouble
bending the rules

661
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,329
when it's to your advantage, do you?

662
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,323
What did they want with you?

663
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,248
I shouldn't bring you into this.

664
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:48,159
It's all right.

665
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,781
You can talk to me.

666
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:54,259
I heard the guard say

667
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:55,668
he found something in your wallet.

668
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:57,227
Yeah, they confiscated it.

669
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:58,904
What was it?

670
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:00,458
What did he find?

671
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,262
A phone number.

672
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,001
Whose?

673
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,396
Listen to me.

674
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:16,193
If you and I are
in the same situation here,

675
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,986
we should know each other.

676
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:23,621
Talk to me.

677
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,111
Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved.

678
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,353
I met some people
through my organization.

679
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:30,912
What organization is that?

680
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,339
The IAA.

681
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:33,852
I'm regional director.

682
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:35,030
Go on.

683
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,519
Most of what we do has no... teeth.

684
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,509
I was introduced
to a man who was more active.

685
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:42,875
I wanted to help him.

686
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,483
That's good.

687
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,535
We set up a meeting
but before I had a chance,

688
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,859
I was grabbed.

689
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:51,873
Who is this person?

690
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,303
Abu Fayed.

691
00:35:58,394 --> 00:35:59,697
You know him?

692
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:05,447
<i>But, please...</i>

693
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,908
Join us, brother.

694
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,587
He did that well.

695
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:22,726
What happens now?

696
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,906
He's going to have
to sell himself to the others

697
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,280
before they open up.

698
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:41,841
I-- didn't know
that you were coming here.

699
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,122
We need to talk.

700
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,577
Yeah, sure, yeah. Come on in. Come on.

701
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,751
Damn, Jack,

702
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:52,630
it's good to see you. Good to see you.

703
00:36:57,703 --> 00:36:59,304
You've never been here before, have you?

704
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:02,353
God, when was
the last time we saw each other?

705
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,232
When Teri died.

706
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:06,731
That's right. The funeral.

707
00:37:06,902 --> 00:37:08,119
Have you found Dad yet?

708
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,383
No, no, I made some calls
but so far noth...

709
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:11,665
Hey, Josh!

710
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,021
Come here.

711
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:15,060
This is your Uncle Jack.

712
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:17,816
You two have not seen
each other in a long time.

713
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:22,062
Hey.

714
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:23,778
Hi, Josh.

715
00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:27,429
How you doing?

716
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,768
Okay, I guess.

717
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,669
It's kind of been a weird day.

718
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,805
Yeah, I know.

719
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:36,067
Josh, give your father some privacy.

720
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,451
Maybe we can talk later.

721
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:46,237
I would like that.

722
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:53,601
Marilyn, I'm sorry for the intrusion.

723
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:57,181
I just need to get some information
about our father and then I'll leave.

724
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,851
Well, that was pleasant, wasn't it?

725
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:06,726
Come on, let's go to my office.

726
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:23,824
Have a seat.

727
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,298
I'm fine.

728
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,198
Okay, so what are we doing here, Jack?

729
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:31,127
Our father used to do business
with an ex-Russian general.

730
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,856
His name was Gredenko. Do you know him?

731
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,007
No. He must be one of the old guard.

732
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:39,099
You can't believe
some of the drinking buddies

733
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:40,594
Dad's cultivated over the years.

734
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,778
Oh, there was this one time,

735
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,005
we were down in Venezuela,
this was before Chavez...

736
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:45,094
Gray!

737
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,126
I didn't come here
to listen to your stories.

738
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,152
I'm serious. I need to find Dad.

739
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,253
Okay, we will.

740
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,688
Boy, Jack, you could never just

741
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,717
walk in a room and get along,
could you?

742
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,676
I mean, I know, you know,

743
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,982
you must have gone through hell
in China and everything,

744
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,569
but look on the bright side--
you got out. You're here.

745
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:05,123
You should just relax a little bit.

746
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,333
If you try and raise your voice,

747
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,233
I will rip your tongue out,
are we clear?

748
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,170
Gray, people in this country are dying.

749
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:55,857
I need some information.

750
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:57,565
Are you going to give it to me,

751
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,080
or do I have to start hurting you?

752
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:00,888
Actually, you're hurting me now.

753
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,457
Trust me... I'm not.

754
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,993
The speech is in the teleprompter, sir.

755
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,459
- With the most recent changes?
- Yes, sir.

756
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:21,830
Okay.

757
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:27,003
Are you all right, sir?

758
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,092
Tom, I can't let the American public
see how scared I am.

759
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:35,589
No, you cannot.

760
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:38,835
But then we just got hit
by a nuclear bomb.

761
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:41,955
Bravado would be
no more appropriate than fear.

762
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:45,814
Thank you, Tom.

763
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,150
My fellow Americans,

764
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,609
there is no easy way to say the words:

765
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:26,283
America has been hit
by a nuclear weapon.

766
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,866
But, as you know, this is now a fact.

767
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:33,028
The question remains,
what do we as a country,

768
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,634
as a people, do about it?

769
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,114
How do we rationalize
the fear and sorrow

770
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:39,334
that each one of us feels?

771
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:43,075
Do we let our anger
guide us down a dangerous path?

772
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:45,338
Or do we come together,

773
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,668
continuing to show courage and strength

774
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:50,205
in the face of our enemy?

775
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:54,850
Now, this horrible act of evil
which has struck our great nation

776
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:57,252
is the cowardly action of barbaric men.

777
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,549
One more thing comes out
of your mouth that I don't want to hear,

778
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,544
- and this is gonna start to hurt.
- I don't know

779
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:03,806
where he is. What do you want?

780
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,139
- The truth.
- It's the truth.

781
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,976
I swear to you on my family's life.

782
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:12,904
Not good enough.

783
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:23,697
You brought this on yourself.

784
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,457
