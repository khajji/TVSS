1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:06,434

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:11,434

3
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,701
Bomb!
(explosion thunders)

4
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:22,900
Vice President Daniels
is running this country now.

5
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:25,867
He will implement
your security plan.

6
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,234
Agent Lowry, these men
are responsible for

7
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,301
the attempted assassination
of the president.

8
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,833
WOMAN:
 <i>I have the Vice President</i>
 <i>calling for Mr. Buchanan.</i>

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,501
DANIELS:
 <i>Bill, I see</i>
 <i>from the White House flashes</i>

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,934
that President Palmer
granted Charles Logan

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,267
some kind of furlough.

12
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,367
Logan claims he can help us find
Dmitri Gredenko.

13
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,134
DANIELS:
 <i>How?</i>

14
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,934
BUCHANAN:
 <i>Through the Russian consulate</i>
 <i>in Los Angeles.</i>

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,334
LOGAN:
The bomb
that exploded

16
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,833
this morning was a Russian
suitcase nuclear device

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,867
supplied to the terrorists
by Dmitri Gredenko.

18
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:54,201
 <i>Where is he?</i>

19
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,634
I don't know.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,167
(phone ringing)
Yes?

21
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,401
MARKOV:
The United States

22
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:02,167
has connected you
with terrorists.

23
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,601
The reason we brought
the Arabs into this

24
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:07,034
was to conceal our involvement.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,334
Now we are exposed.

26
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,833
Russia is exposed.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,668
Jack, you just spent nearly
two years in a Chinese prison

28
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,733
because you violated the
sovereignty of their consulate.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,501
Now you plan to go back
into the Russian consulate

30
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,700
and take a chance
on that happening again?!

31
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,134
BAUER:
 <i>How do I find Gredenko?!</i>

32
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,668
M-Mojave Desert.

33
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,100
Shadow Valley.

34
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,334
What is he doing?

35
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,367
Launching drones.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,501
How soon will the drones
be ready?

37
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:39,767
In two hours, all the bombs
will be in the air.

38
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,601
Now!

39
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,568
I've got to set the transcript
codes for the debrief.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,967
Thank you.

41
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,134
Who are you?

42
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,833
I'm just Chloe O'Brian.

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
I-I need to do something
on this computer.

44
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,134
Do you know what's going on
with Jack Bauer?

45
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,501
As far as I know,
he's still being held

46
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:57,833
in the Russian consulate.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,100
I need to talk
to Bill Buchanan right now.

48
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,067
He'll be here after
his meeting.
Does he know

49
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,067
that I'm all alone here
in a holding cell?

50
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:10,134
This isn't really a cell,
and you're hardly alone.

51
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:11,668
This is standard procedure

52
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,934
for someone who's
under house arrest.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,833
Excuse me?
Sorry.

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,534
I-I'm feeling ambivalent.
I'm gonna go.

55
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,767
All right, I want to introduce
everyone to Mike Doyle.

56
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,534
He's the new head
of Field Ops,

57
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,967
just in from Fort Bragg.
I want all

58
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:35,201
tactical and comm agents
to report to him directly.

59
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,601
Jack Bauer's currently
being held captive

60
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:37,767
in the Russian consulate.

61
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,167
I haven't opened up
that information

62
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,267
to anyone on
the outside.

63
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,301
Doyle will help you

64
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,568
put a tactical
profile together

65
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,134
for an assault
on the consulate.

66
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,634
MILO: So, we're
permitted

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,134
to provoke an
international incident

68
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:50,301
just to liberate one
of our own operatives?

69
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,234
No. Liberating Jack
is a secondary goal.

70
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,234
Our primary objective is to
abduct Anatoly Markov,

71
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,867
the consul. Now,
according to Jack,

72
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:58,867
Markov knows how
to find Gredenko,

73
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,668
who controls the remaining
three suitcase nukes.

74
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,900
Excuse me, but is nobody worried

75
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,401
that this could be considered
an act of war

76
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:04,501
against the Russians?

77
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:05,934
BUCHANAN:
Ultimately,

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,134
it's the vice president's
decision if we go in or not.

79
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,100
But, if Jack
is right,

80
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,301
and Markov is working
with Gredenko,

81
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,833
the Russians will
have to back down.

82
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,000
Sir, Logan is ready
for you.

83
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,234
Thank you.

84
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,201
I want a comprehensive siege
profile on my desk ASAP.

85
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,034
Who has the control keys
for the main servers?

86
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
Uh, I do.
Okay, bracket the
scenarios into three.

87
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,100
I want projected
outcomes based on

88
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,267
different levels
of personnel.

89
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,767
MILO:
Doyle, normally,
we run general

90
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,534
attack assessment first,
then if there's any...

91
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:35,534
I don't care what
you normally do, Pressman.

92
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:37,234
And I wasn't
speaking to you.

93
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,067
I was talking with her.

94
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:40,334
MILO:
Yeah, that's so weird,

95
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,401
'cause I had this thought
that you might come here

96
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:46,167
and not be a jerk, like you were
in Denver, but you are.

97
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,367
That's right.

98
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:48,733
Just like Denver.

99
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,134
Let's get to work.

100
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,100
I take it
you know him?

101
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,367
Yeah.

102
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:57,767
I don't like him very much.

103
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,767
Does he know
what he's doing?

104
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,401
Yeah, he's good.

105
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,601
What did Buchanan say?

106
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,301
We're ready to move
on the consulate,

107
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,467
pending White House approval.

108
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:11,601
Is Jack on his own?

109
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah.

110
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,967
This is all about getting
Markov, not saving Jack.

111
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,100
Yeah?

112
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm terminating the American.

113
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:41,301
Do you confirm?
Yes.

114
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,900
And you're sure there won't be
any political complications?

115
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,234
Not if we stick to our story.

116
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,234
The American kills
our head of security,

117
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,100
tries to escape.

118
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,601
The American has shot Vasili.

119
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,501
He's in the basement.
Find him!

120
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,000
AGENT:
Consul Markov?

121
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,234
Yes.

122
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,100
We haven't found the American,

123
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,733
but I locked down
the perimeter.

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,601
There is no way
to leave the building.

125
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:13,201
He can't be allowed to call out.

126
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,367
Shut down the phone lines,
DSL, everything.

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,401
CTU. O'Brian.

128
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,467
Morris, it's Jack.

129
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,733
I know how to find Gredenko.

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,967
He's in the...
(dial tone)

131
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,134
Morris?

132
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,900
Jack? Jack? Jack!

133
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,234
(dial tone)
Come on!

134
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,467
Damn it!

135
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,800
Sir, Morris just
got a call from Jack.

136
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,800
The line went dead
before he could finish,

137
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,700
but he says he knows
where Gredenko is.

138
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:15,967
Did he trace
the call?

139
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,167
He's still inside
the consulate.

140
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,634
All right, monitor
everything in case

141
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,134
he calls back, and tell
Doyle Bauer's got key intel,

142
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,401
and is no longer
dispensable.

143
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,301
Got it.

144
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,434
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,401
We're going to have
to reschedule our debrief.

146
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:37,934
Why?

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,167
We have an immediate situation
at the Russian consulate.

148
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,934
Does this have something to do

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,601
with Bauer going
back in there to
question Markov?

150
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:46,167
Please, Bill.

151
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,467
Maybe I can help.

152
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,700
Jack was able
to get Grendenko's location

153
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:57,867
from Markov.

154
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,967
He tried to call us,
but was cut off

155
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,367
before he could say more.

156
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,467
He's either being held prisoner
in the consulate,

157
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,201
or he's being pursued.

158
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,067
Then I was right.
Markov is involved.

159
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:10,034
And he will do whatever it
takes to keep Jack quiet.

160
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,934
We have to
extricate Jack,

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,967
and failing that,
we have to go in

162
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,833
and remove Markov
and interrogate him ourselves.

163
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,501
We don't have time to
go through the red tape.

164
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,267
There's not gonna be
any red tape.

165
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,534
I'm launching an assault team.

166
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,367
No, that's... that
is a huge mistake.

167
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,467
Markov will not let
himself be taken alive,

168
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,067
and he will
kill Jack Bauer.

169
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,401
We have to try something.

170
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,568
We're running out of options.

171
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,534
Have you tried any pressure
from the top?

172
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,301
From-From President Suvarov?

173
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,134
Vice President Daniels
has spoken to Suvarov.

174
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,367
He's reluctant to act.

175
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,334
It's a diplomatic standoff.

176
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,568
He needs to be convinced
to get involved.

177
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,700
I don't know
how to do that.

178
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,833
I do.

179
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,767
How?

180
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,334
My ex-wife, Martha.

181
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,334
She became friends
with the Suvarovs,

182
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,867
especially the wife.

183
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,434
Anya can get through to Yuri.

184
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,833
He listens to her.

185
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
They're a very good team.

186
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,867
Um, with all due respect,

187
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,967
hasn't Mrs. Logan
been institutionalized?

188
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,367
That's beside
the point.

189
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,334
She's in a unique position
to help us.

190
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,000
All right. I'll-I'll...
put a call in to her.

191
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,501
Bill, let me do it.

192
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,034
Martha can be
very difficult.

193
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,267
I think it would be best
if I talked to her.

194
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,367
I didn't realize
you were on speaking terms.

195
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:31,568
We're not, but I think
I can get through to her.

196
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,201
I know I can.

197
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,401
Please, let me try.

198
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,568
That's the
way I want it.

199
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,401
How many on each
of those teams?

200
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,601
Five.

201
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:43,967
Okay, make it three.
More teams,

202
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,568
more area covered.
Fine.

203
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,867
Who's estimating the
consulate defense figures?

204
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,700
That would be me.

205
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,301
Where are the numbers?
I'm just sorting them
before I put them out.

206
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,467
Of course you are.

207
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:54,634
Where are the numbers?

208
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,401
Oh, I see. This is
about whether or not

209
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,733
it takes eight seconds
or ten seconds.

210
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,100
There are your numbers
sorted three ways. Pick one.

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,067
Hey!

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,668
Do I have your attention?
'Cause I only want

213
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,267
to do this once.

214
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,534
I have 25 soldiers

215
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:15,134
that are about to put
their asses on the line.

216
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,501
Whether they live or die

217
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,334
largely depends
on what gets done here.

218
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,800
That's not to mention

219
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,634
the larger threat
of three nuclear weapons

220
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,267
that may be down the street,
for all we know.

221
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,800
So, if anyone has a problem
taking orders from me

222
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,100
without giving me lip,
tell me now,

223
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,568
and I will have you reassigned.

224
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,501
Doyle.

225
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,201
You keep your hands
off my people.

226
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,634
Is that clear?

227
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,800
DOYLE:
They need to understand
what I expect from them.

228
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,034
MILO:
I know what you expect.

229
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,434
That's all
that matters.

230
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,867
You have a problem with somebody
on my team, you come to me.

231
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,967
Fair enough.

232
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:58,100
Have your "team"
merge their results

233
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,134
and download it onto my system.

234
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,401
You all right?

235
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,634
The shirt's a blend;
it doesn't wrinkle.

236
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,134
You know what I mean.

237
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,267
Yes.

238
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,301
I am all right.

239
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,201
I thought I was a
pain in the ass.

240
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,334
The Vice President
likes you, Tom.

241
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:26,201
He hopes you have the right
answer for him.

242
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,234
Well, I hope so, too.

243
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,867
Tom Lennox, man of the hour.

244
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,401
It's all right.

245
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,467
You can leave us alone.

246
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:45,201
So, have you given any thought
to our earlier conversation?

247
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,367
Yes, I have, sir.

248
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,501
And?

249
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:48,767
And I agree

250
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,900
that the priority here is
to protect our country.

251
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,367
And I am prepared

252
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,067
to look the other way
regarding details

253
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,601
of the assassination plot.

254
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,601
To a point.

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,234
Well, what does that mean?

256
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:08,767
It means the truth must
ultimately come out.

257
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,700
Reed and Carson need to be
punished for what they did.

258
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,668
And they will.

259
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:18,800
Look, all I'm trying to do is
keep America united.

260
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,267
I can't have our critics
screaming,

261
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,934
"Look at how bad we are.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,167
We're worse than
the terrorists."

263
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:29,100
We need to keep our eye
on the ball right now.

264
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,034
And on that point, sir,
we are in complete agreement.

265
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Good, because I need you

266
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,568
to tell the ambassador
of Assad's country

267
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,900
that you saw Assad plant the
bomb that injured the president.

268
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:44,534
Sir, looking the other way is
one thing,

269
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:45,934
choosing to tell a lie

270
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,568
to the ambassador,
that becomes

271
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,733
a matter of record.

272
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,601
Now, you listen to me:

273
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,067
If we expect to navigate
through this crisis,

274
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,900
I need you to cooperate.

275
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,467
Yes, and I would
like to cooperate.

276
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,967
I'm still talking!

277
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,833
Come on, now, Tom,

278
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,301
let's just count our blessings
here for a minute.

279
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,367
President Palmer survived
this awful attack.

280
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:20,301
And neither you
nor I had anything to do

281
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,167
with this heinous plot
to kill him.

282
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,668
And the most

283
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,100
beautiful fact of all is

284
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,167
that we now have
the opportunity

285
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,934
to implement
the correct policy

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,867
to stop these terrorist
lunatics.

287
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:37,833
Can you just put
aside your distaste 

288
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,800
for my methods
for one minute...

289
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,334
and think about
the great gift

290
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,034
that's been given
to us.

291
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:49,267
I will think long and hard, sir.

292
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:50,367
Good.

293
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:55,267
Now, I need you
to tell the ambassador

294
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,401
that Assad carried
in the bomb.

295
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,767
I'll take it from there.

296
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,767
(chuckles):
Okay?

297
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,967
Okay.

298
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,534
Lisa, get the ambassador
clearance and bring him

299
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,334
down here.

300
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:16,301
Let DOJ know

301
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,301
that Lennox has been
cleared of any wrongdoing

302
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:22,067
and will continue serving
as Chief of Staff.

303
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,100
Yes, sir.

304
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,401
(sighs)

305
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,067
Sir, I would like to know
what you hope to achieve

306
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,568
in your talk
with the ambassador.

307
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,067
I want him to know

308
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,000
that I hold his country

309
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,334
responsible for all of it--

310
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,467
the nuke and the presidential
assassination attempt.

311
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,134
They need
to be motivated

312
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,867
to reign in
these terrorists.

313
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,201
And I want them to know

314
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,234
that America is mad as hell
and ready to retaliate

315
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,501
--Here's Fayed.

316
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,100
It's about time
he got here.

317
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,800
We need to start
loading the bombs.

318
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:38,933
Mr. Vice President.

319
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
Bill, you're on speaker.

320
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,301
I'm here with Tom Lennox.

321
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,933
What's going on
at the Russian consulate?

322
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,467
Jack Bauer's still at large
and somewhere inside.

323
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:47,467
It appears he now also knows
Gredenko's location,

324
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,100
but isn't able
to get it to us.

325
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,234
All right, then what's the plan?

326
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,768
Former President Logan
believes

327
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,167
he can convince
his ex-wife

328
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,634
to put a call
into Anya Suvarov.

329
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:59,100
He thinks the Russian
First Lady can get through

330
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,501
to her husband.
(chuckles)

331
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,100
That's about as likely
as the terrorists knocking

332
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,567
on my door
and surrendering.

333
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:07,301
I agree.

334
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:10,267
That's why we've also
prepared a siege plan.

335
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,768
A strike force will enter
the consulate

336
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,900
and extract Markov
for interrogation.

337
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,534
You realize an attack

338
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,534
on a Russian consulate is
technically an act of war.

339
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:19,668
I do, sir.

340
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,100
Frankly, I'm reluctant

341
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,401
to go the tactical
route here.

342
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,034
We got our hands full
with these terrorists,

343
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,301
we don't need to open up
another front with the Russians.

344
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:27,534
Of course,
it's your decision, sir.

345
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:28,634
I understand the politics

346
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:30,000
are sticky,

347
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,601
but my responsibility is
to stop these nukes.

348
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:35,267
Markov will not surrender
willingly.

349
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,267
We have to go in.

350
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:39,534
How long will it take you
to put together this siege?

351
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,867
About 20 minutes.

352
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,701
All right.

353
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:46,967
Proceed as if you're going in.

354
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,467
If Logan can be
effective

355
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,000
before then, great..

356
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,267
but don't wait on him.

357
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:53,634
Yes, sir.

358
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,701
You ready?
Yes.

359
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,701
All right, take your team
to their first location,

360
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:59,668
and await our word.
Got it.

361
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,334
Martha, I'm back.

362
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,601
Did you get some rest?

363
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:22,701
I've been worried
about you.

364
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,768
Worried about me?

365
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,933
You shouldn't be out
driving around

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,367
with all that fallout
in the air.

367
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,367
Well, I'm keeping
a good distance away.

368
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:30,933
How are you?

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,534
Well, I've decided to read
my book and listen to music.

370
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,900
I've lived with enough fear
over the years.

371
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,334
I don't need anymore.

372
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,367
Good for you.

373
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,933
Got your magazines.

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,867
Thank you.

375
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:52,734
And I stopped by Mel's.

376
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,900
(gasps)

377
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,100
Did you get raspberries?

378
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,601
(gasps)
And blackberries
and fresh kiwi.

379
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:02,200
Oh, oh, thank God for Mel.

380
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,367
What would I do without
that man's produce?

381
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:09,467
Oh, these look
beautiful.

382
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:11,933
Mmm.

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,167
Ooh, here-- have one.

384
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,534
I'm fine.

385
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:15,967
Come on.

386
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,534
Hmm?

387
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,567
Can you get that?

388
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,067
Martha Logan's bungalow.

389
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,401
May I speak to
Martha, please?

390
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,933
Who is this?

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,634
It's Charles, Aaron.

392
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,434
Please put her on;
it's important.

393
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,434
Hold on.

394
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,501
Who is it?

395
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,768
It's Charles.

396
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,334
He says
it's important.

397
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,334
Important to whom?

398
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:00,234
Mr. Logan, she doesn't want
to talk to you.

399
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,900
I heard what she said.

400
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,134
Look, listen to me,
I'm in CTU in Los Angeles.

401
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,401
I'm here on government business

402
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,967
and it has to do
with the nuclear attack.

403
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,768
I don't understand how Martha

404
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,234
could possibly be
of any help.

405
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,534
What you understand
really doesn't matter.

406
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:16,234
I no longer have to tolerate
your sarcasm.

407
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,701
Please, this was not sarcasm.

408
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:20,034
Something needs to be done.

409
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,134
And, and I think that Martha
might be able to help.

410
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,534
I don't know what to
tell you, Mr. Logan,

411
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,800
but Martha simply doesn't
want to speak with you.

412
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,867
She hasn't taken your
calls in almost two years.

413
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,768
I don't know why you
think she would now.

414
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,234
Tell her
it's about the Suvarovs.

415
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,301
What?

416
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,601
Just do it.

417
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,100
Please.

418
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:42,267
Martha, he wants to ask you...

419
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,900
I told you.

420
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,467
I don't want to talk to him.

421
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,501
It's about the Suvarovs.

422
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:52,234
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

423
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,634
I don't know.

424
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,401
(sighs)

425
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,867
What is it?

426
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,000
Is Anya okay?

427
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,567
Anya's fine, Martha.

428
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:03,833
They're both fine.

429
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,867
Then what the hell do you want?

430
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,167
It's a very delicate matter.

431
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:13,000
There's an international
incident brewing

432
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:16,267
and I think that you might
be able to help defuse it.

433
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,000
Let me get this straight:

434
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,501
The government is desperate

435
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,401
so they come to you
to fix the world...

436
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:25,467
and, uh, then you come to me.

437
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,768
I can't be dragged in another
drama, with you Charles.

438
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,900
I won't.

439
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,301
You know what's going on
today, Martha.

440
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,367
You know that this is

441
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:33,668
important!

442
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,534
This is absurd.

443
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,301
You still there?

444
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:47,534
Yes, I'm still here.

445
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,301
Aaron, you know
I wouldn't be playing games

446
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:50,467
on a day like today.

447
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:52,634
I know.

448
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,334
You need to convince her
to see me.

449
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:58,067
I'm going to take a chopper
to you

450
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,833
and I'll be there
in a few minutes.

451
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:06,501
Aaron?

452
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,800
All right.

453
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,467
--This is Shavers.

454
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,234
BUCHANAN:
Stan, let me talk to Logan.

455
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,301
Sir, it's Mr. Buchanan.

456
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,201
Yes, Bill?

457
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:39,934
We've dispatched personnel
to prepare for an assault

458
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,700
on the Russian consulate.

459
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:45,334
Bill, attacking the consulate
is a huge error in judgment.

460
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,067
This has been decided.

461
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,001
The only way to avoid full-out
confrontation with the Russians

462
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:53,334
is for you can get Martha to
make the call before we engage.

463
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:14,301
(woman speaks Russian,
then giggles)

464
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:18,533
(man speaks Russian,
woman laughs)

465
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,001
Slowly...

466
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,268
both of you against the wall.

467
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,800
Please don't hurt her.

468
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:30,967
I have no intention
of hurting

469
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,201
either of you.

470
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:34,167
But if you don't cooperate,
I will kill you.

471
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:36,734
You understand me?
Both of you speak English?

472
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,134
Yes.

473
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:40,368
I need to make
an outside call.
You can't.

474
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,334
They've cut all
communications
from the building

475
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,567
because you
killed Stovich.

476
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,001
I didn't kill Stovich.

477
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,533
I don't believe you.

478
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,433
I don't have
to convince you.

479
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,967
We'll do
whatever you want.

480
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:51,400
In case of
an emergency,

481
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,567
how do you contact
the outside world?

482
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:56,034
Please, there's a
SATCOM phone upstairs.

483
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,500
Get it and bring it down here.

484
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,167
We're in the middle
of a lockdown.

485
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:01,400
That's your problem.
Get me that phone.

486
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,301
Now!
Okay.

487
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,034
Get against the desk.

488
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,767
Don't be scared.

489
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,433
You'll be fine.

490
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,934
Hello, Aaron.

491
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,834
Martha's waiting for you.

492
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:57,634
She's inside.

493
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,667
Thank you.

494
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,600
Martha?

495
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,134
I'll get her.

496
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,034
What's the matter?

497
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:48,368
Apparently she's
changed her mind.

498
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:50,334
I'm sorry, but she doesn't
want to see you.

499
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,167
Aaron...

500
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:55,001
you have to convince her
that this is not about us.

501
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,634
This is for the good
of the country.

502
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,034
I told her that.

503
00:25:58,101 --> 00:25:59,967
Look, if we don't do something
in the next few minutes,

504
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:02,301
there's going to be a U.S.-
led assault on the Russian

505
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,700
consulate here
in Los Angeles.

506
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,234
On top of everything else,

507
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:08,467
we will effectively
be at war with Russia.

508
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,134
MARTHA:
You've lost weight.

509
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:20,567
Martha.

510
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:25,201
So this is the new,
improved Charles Logan.

511
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,368
Reborn.

512
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,667
You look beautiful.

513
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:43,201
What do you want?

514
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:47,201
I need you to call Anya Suvarov.

515
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:48,767
What do you want
me to say to her?

516
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:50,800
She has to
convince Yuri

517
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:52,268
to order the
Russian Consul

518
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:55,734
General, here in Los Angeles,
to surrender himself.

519
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,567
And why would he do that?

520
00:26:57,634 --> 00:26:59,867
Because the man--
his name is Anatoly Markov--

521
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,600
he's a criminal and he's working

522
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,967
outside of Russian authority.

523
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,433
So what?
He's also a
mass murderer.

524
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
The bomb that went off
this morning in Valencia

525
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,368
was supplied to the terrorists

526
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:11,767
with Markov's help.

527
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,067
There are other
bombs out there.

528
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,734
He knows where they are.

529
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,567
Why doesn't the White House
just contact Yuri directly?

530
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:22,667
They did. It didn't work.
Why not?

531
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,201
Martha, this is
very complicated.

532
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,901
Please don't
make me explain

533
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,400
everything in details--
we don't have much time.
Oh, oh, oh...

534
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:31,433
I'm sorry; just do what
you say without asking.

535
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,567
I'm sorry.
You haven't changed a bit.

536
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:36,800
Look at this. Look at this!

537
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:38,334
I'm still under arrest.

538
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,268
After this is over,
I go back to prison.

539
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:43,101
I'm just trying to help.

540
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,433
Prison?

541
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,268
Is that what you call
a 10,000-square-foot

542
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,167
house with a swimming
pool and tennis court?

543
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,667
Yuri has to be convinced
that this man Markov

544
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:54,301
 is a traitor to his country.

545
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:57,433
Anya can make
our case for us.

546
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,101
You're the only person
who can reach her fast.

547
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,234
Do you think I should do this?

548
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,433
Yes, I do.

549
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,567
I need a drink.

550
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:30,600
(tense, wry laugh)

551
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:34,167
Not that knocking me
off the wagon

552
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:35,734
would be a small price to pay

553
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,700
for saving the world.

554
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,167
Get Anya on the phone.

555
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,067
--NADIA:
How far are you from
the Russian consulate?

556
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:04,334
We'll be there in a few minutes.

557
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,234
Has there been any
change of plans?

558
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,500
No.
As far as I know,

559
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,433
the assault on the consulate
is still a go.

560
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I'm about to talk
to Buchannan now.

561
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,134
Call me if anything changes.

562
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,901
Okay.

563
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,301
Have a seat,
Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you.

564
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,734
How is President Palmer?

565
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,500
Well...

566
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:29,500
The President's a tough man.

567
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,634
He's injured,
but we're confident

568
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,934
he'll make a full recovery.

569
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,967
What a tragic and
despicable act.
I agree.

570
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,734
What makes it even
more troubling

571
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,901
is that a citizen of your
country, Hamri Al-Assad,

572
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:42,301
was responsible for the
assassination attempt.

573
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:45,301
I understand that Assad
lost his life in the blast.

574
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,600
But I was led to believe
that he was working

575
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,134
with President Palmer
to promote a peace plan.

576
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,967
Well, I'm
afraid that was

577
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:53,700
all a ruse, Mr. Ambassador.

578
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,600
Assad's real
intentions

579
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,934
became clear when he
detonated the explosive.

580
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,634
You have proof of this?
Conclusive.

581
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,533
Forensic evidence, as well as
at least one eyewitness

582
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,001
who saw the detonator
in Assad's hand

583
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,334
immediately before
the explosion.

584
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,167
Isn't that right, Tom?

585
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:15,867
Yes, sir, that is correct.

586
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:20,734
Even if what you say is true,

587
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,700
you must know
that Hamri Al-Assad

588
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,634
was not working at the behest
of our government.

589
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,634
He was as much a wanted man in
our country as he was in yours.

590
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,500
Oh, not as much.

591
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,533
But that's
gonna change.

592
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,634
What are you referring to?

593
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,467
The terrorists presently on
U.S. soil are acting

594
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:43,134
under the orders of citizens
in your country

595
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,433
who have the support
of your government.

596
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,700
I know it and
you know it.

597
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,533
That is simply not true.
I say it is.

598
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,201
And I'm willing to bet you
that I'm right.

599
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:52,533
What do you mean?

600
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,533
I have a carrier group
within striking distance

601
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,567
of every major city
in your country,

602
00:30:58,634 --> 00:31:00,567
waiting for me
to give the order.

603
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:01,700
You would attack us?

604
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:03,201
Abu Fayed, a citizen
of your country,

605
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:06,268
enters the United
States and detonates

606
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:09,167
a nuclear bomb,
killing thousands.

607
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,334
Next, Assad attempts to
assassinate the president.

608
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,667
We cannot be held responsible.

609
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,867
You know fully well that
we have cooperated with you

610
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:19,301
since the inception
of this crisis.

611
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,700
These threats against us are
reckless and counterproductive.

612
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,767
I had an understanding
with your president.

613
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:26,034
And now you're going
to have one with me.

614
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,800
You help us find those nukes
before another goes off...

615
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,867
or I'm going to unleash
the full power

616
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,967
of our military on your country.

617
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:40,533
All right, keep me posted.

618
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,134
Doyle is approaching
the staging area.

619
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,400
We can in the consulate
in less than 15 minutes.

620
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,167
It's going to come right
down to the wire.

621
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:47,600
What do you mean?

622
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,800
Charles, Logan and I are trying
to arrange a phone call between

623
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,901
his ex-wife Martha
and Anya Suvarov.

624
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:54,400
When?

625
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,101
Mrs. Suvarov's giving a speech
right now in Omsk.

626
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,567
We have to wait till
she's finished.

627
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:59,433
Even if Mrs. Logan can
get through to Anya,

628
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,901
it's going to take her some time

629
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:02,567
to convince her husband
to change his mind.

630
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,834
I agree.
It's a long shot.

631
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,268
It shouldn't take much longer.

632
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:08,533
LOGAN:
I don't understand.
This is important.

633
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,268
Why don't they just interrupt
her speech?

634
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:12,800
It's Russian politics.
There's nothing we can do.

635
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,567
Fine.

636
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,201
It's gonna be
a few more minutes.

637
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,368
PIERCE:
What's the matter, hon?

638
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:27,368
This is taking forever.
I know.

639
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,201
Aaron... you promise
you'll stand by me,

640
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,967
even if I can't
go through with this?

641
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:35,834
Of course I will.

642
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,800
Martha, I'm sorry.

643
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:39,834
The last thing
I wanted to do

644
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,368
was upset you.

645
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,734
Funny, you always
manage to get

646
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,034
to that <i>last</i> thing.

647
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,934
Let me ask you
something, Charles.

648
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,467
Does it bother you

649
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,700
to see me with another man?
Martha, please.

650
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,001
We may as well talk
to fill the time.

651
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:04,034
We never really had any closure.

652
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,533
Well?

653
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,167
Yes. It's very difficult.

654
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:13,433
If you want to know the truth.

655
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,334
But you've had a rebirth.

656
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,467
You should be happy
for my happiness.

657
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,867
I am happy for you, Martha.

658
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,767
I'm sure you are.

659
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:32,134
You know, Charles,

660
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:35,001
Aaron has taken
such good care of me.

661
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,201
I don't know
what I did to deserve

662
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,234
such a good man.

663
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,368
I never knew
what that was before.

664
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:46,067
A really <i>good</i> man.

665
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:47,901
Martha, if it makes you
feel better to insult me,

666
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,201
please feel free.

667
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,001
I didn't come here
to fight with you.

668
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,368
It does make me feel better.

669
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,867
I can say exactly I want,
finally, without having

670
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,467
to worry about
incurring your wrath.

671
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,967
The great Charles Logan.

672
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,433
The President of the Universe.

673
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,301
The great leader.
The murderer.

674
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:06,034
Martha, I want you
to stop this right now.

675
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:07,767
You're going to get
all stirred up.

676
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,334
Oh, well, God,

677
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,700
we couldn't have that, could we?

678
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:12,533
(knife clatters)

679
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:18,268
Mr. Logan,

680
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:19,934
if you'd be more
comfortable

681
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:21,667
waiting outside,
I'd understand.

682
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:22,901
I appreciate that, Aaron,

683
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:24,767
but I think
I'll stay right here.

684
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,433
Actually, I'm very thankful

685
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
that you've been able
to be here for Martha.

686
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,700
You <i>are</i> a good man.

687
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,433
She's very lucky to have you.

688
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:46,400
Now you're trying to
irritate me, aren't you?

689
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:49,600
No, Martha, no.
I'm not.

690
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,234
Oh, cut the crap.

691
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,467
With the sincerity,
the new

692
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,400
enlightened soul.

693
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,268
At least you used
to be an honest crook.

694
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,734
PIERCE:
That's enough.

695
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,034
Please.

696
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,533
Sorry.

697
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll be a good little girl.

698
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,400
(Martha yells)

699
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,334
Oh, my God.

700
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:30,101
We need a medic
in here right now!

701
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,067
He just wouldn't
stop and I, oh, oh...

702
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:34,800
Oh, my God, what did I do?
You must've hit an artery.

703
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,667
Agent Foley, get in here now!

704
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,500
Somebody, come on!

705
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,167
Martha, look what
you've done!

706
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,601
--MEDIC:
He's going in to shock.

707
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:55,934
Let's get him out of here.

708
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:58,001
Now.

709
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:05,001
PIERCE:
It happened too fast, Bill.

710
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:06,701
I couldn't stop her.

711
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,767
BUCHANAN:
There's nothing we can
do about it, Aaron.

712
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,267
Right now, I've been ordered
by the vice president to send

713
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,167
an assault team into
the Russian consulate, unless

714
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,667
President Suvarov intercedes.
I understand.

715
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:17,300
Is Martha capable of having

716
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,801
a coherent conversation
with Anya Suvarov?

717
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:22,634
Honestly, I don't know.

718
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:25,100
Chloe's putting the call through
any second. Find out.

719
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:26,267
Will do.

720
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,767
Why are they
doing this to me?

721
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,133
I should be given a medal.

722
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,734
He was one of the biggest
criminals in history.

723
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:41,968
They gave him house arrest.

724
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:45,068
Martha, we're still
in a crisis situation.

725
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,834
Are you able to handle

726
00:36:46,901 --> 00:36:49,068
a conversation
with Anya Suvarov?

727
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,734
Of course, I am.
I'm not crazy.

728
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,068
I know what the stakes are.

729
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,500
Are you sure?

730
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,500
AGENT:
Mr. Pierce,

731
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,267
CTU's got Anya Suvarov

732
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,567
on the line
for Mrs. Logan.

733
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:05,100
They're putting
it through now.

734
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,567
Do you know what
you're going to say?

735
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:16,100
Anya, it's Martha.

736
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,634
How are you?

737
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:18,968
I'm fine.

738
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,601
I've been worried about you

739
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,300
there in California.

740
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,801
Stop worrying;
everything's gonna be fine.

741
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,867
I know we have a lot
to catch up on,

742
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:29,968
but I'm going to have
to be rude and get
right to the point.

743
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,701
There's not a lot of time.

744
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:32,934
What is it?

745
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,534
If you've talked
to Yuri recently,

746
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,667
you know there's a very
tense situation going on

747
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:39,601
at the Russian consulate
in Los Angeles.

748
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,734
I've heard something about that,
but don't know the details.

749
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,034
The details are
very important, Anya.

750
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,934
Please, tell me more.

751
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,400
The Americans stepped
on Russian soil

752
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,200
and took me hostage.

753
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:27,867
We will sort out
the details later.

754
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,734
Right now, I am ordering you

755
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,367
to surrender to the Americans

756
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,233
and deliver Jack Bauer,
unharmed.

757
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:39,367
I am afraid...

758
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:41,068
I cannot do that,

759
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,701
Mr. President.

760
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,601
How dare you disobey
a direct order.

761
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,801
You will do exactly
as I tell you!

762
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,068
(phone beeps off)

763
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,467
Mr. Buchanan,

764
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,867
Consul Markov is
not cooperating.

765
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,233
You understand,
Mr. President,

766
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,167
this leaves me
with very few options.

767
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,734
I do.

768
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:15,300
I will personally
authorize the use of force

769
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,233
against the consulate.

770
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,634
The United States
of America has the support

771
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:21,901
of the Russian state
in this matter.

772
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,334
Thank you,
Mr. President.

773
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,367
(phone beeps off)

774
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,133
I got it.

775
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,834
Get over here.

776
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:38,867
Is anybody gonna
notice this missing?

777
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,334
In a few minutes, yes.

778
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Make your call.
Did he hurt you?

779
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,634
No.

780
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:46,801
(phone beeps)

781
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:48,867
It needs the unlock code.

782
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,367
Get down.

783
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,567
(chamber clicks)

784
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:10,068
BUCHANAN (on phone):
Doyle, Suvarov just
gave us the go-ahead.

785
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,434
DOYLE (quietly):
Go!

786
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,400
(chamber clicks)

787
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,767
(gun clatters)

788
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,267
Are you hit?
No.

789
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,834
(phone ringing)
Yes?

790
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,001
It's Markov.
The Americans are coming in.

791
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,100
I thought you had
that under control.

792
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,667
No. Won't be long
(distant gunfire)

793
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:14,834
before they have your position.

794
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:16,734
Hold them off as long
as you can.

795
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:17,901
I will.

796
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:19,734
But you must launch now.

797
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:22,500
Drop your weapon!

798
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,500
My name is Jack Bauer.

799
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:30,634
This man needs medical
attention. They're not hostiles.

800
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:32,901
Okay, send medics
to the basement. I'm Mike Doyle.

801
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:34,834
You need to contact
Bill Buchanan.

802
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:36,267
Tell him that Fayed
and Gredenko

803
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:38,634
are in the Shadow Valley.
Patch me in with Buchanan.

804
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,434
This drone is ready to launch.

805
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,968
Arm the bomb.

806
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,167
Got it.

807
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:59,467
Put all the satellite coverage
we have on Shadow Valley.

808
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,934
Sir, stay still.

809
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,667
