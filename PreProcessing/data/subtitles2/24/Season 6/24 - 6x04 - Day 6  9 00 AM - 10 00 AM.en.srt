00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,581
<i>Previously on</i> 24...

3
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:18,596
Curtis! Everyone back!

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,017
OK, Jack.
The hard drive is mostly toast,

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,797
<i>but I was able to recover
the most recently accessed file.</i>

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,671
Some kind of wire and schematic.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,466
How much of the file do we have?

8
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:33,695
About a page and a half mostly in Arabic
some of it Russian.

9
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:35,665
Do you know what this is?

10
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:37,945
This is a list...

11
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:40,581
of electronic components
for a nuclear device.

12
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,607
- Hello?
- Do you have the package?

13
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:48,822
Not yet but I'll have it soon.

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,233
<i>Call me when you have it.</i>

15
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,794
Look, I don't wanna hurt him or you but
I will unless you do exactly what I say.

16
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,201
There's a package in there.

17
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:58,566
I'm supposed to take it to a man
who has an item for me.

18
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:00,060
When you pick up the item,

19
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:02,503
you call me in and I'll give you
further instructions.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,565
There it is.

21
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:07,803
Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,050
<i>I</i> deleted those files.

23
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,675
I wasn't right for them
to arrest you for my action.

24
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:13,985
You don't touch me!

25
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:15,962
Leave him alone!

26
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:18,840
- Sir, get back in line.
- Not until you let go that man.

27
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,999
Mr President.

28
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:23,638
What do you want?

29
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:27,427
You're holding 110 so called
enemy combattants.

30
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,315
at your Palmdale military facility.

31
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:33,612
You must have all these <i>freedom</i> fighters
on a non-military aircraft

32
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:35,641
in the air by the end of the hour.

33
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:37,795
If you don't release the prisonners
by the deadline,

34
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:40,062
<i>the consequences will be devastating.</i>

35
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,770
<i>Jack, a nuclear device
has been diverted to a scientist</i>

36
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:44,426
<i>with known terrorist ties.</i>

37
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:46,753
Pulling up the file now.

38
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,745
- Do you recognize him?
- Yes.

39
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:55,507
I saw him with Fayed a year ago.
His name is Numair. Hasan Numair.

40
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:57,249
We need to know where this man is now.

41
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,722
Hasan Numair is one of the terrorist
being released

42
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,964
from Palmdale military prison.

43
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,817
Prisonner Numair, identify yourself now.

44
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:10,956
<i>Sargent, Numair is not on the plane.
Repeat, Numair is not on the plane.</i>

45
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:14,009
Hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you.

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,684
<i>The following takes place
between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.</i>

47
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,299
This escape was planned well in advance.

48
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,323
<i>- I agree, sir.</i>
- Fayed's demand for the release

49
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:28,749
of the prisonners was a ploy.

50
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:31,124
He never intended for us
to fly Numair out of the country.

51
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,814
He wanted him free inside our borders.

52
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:34,573
- That's right, sir.
- Do we have any idea

53
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:37,305
where along the route
Numair actually escaped?

54
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,349
It had to be after the bus get on the
highway. He must have had inside help.

55
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:41,777
Is there anyone unaccounted for?

56
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,361
Yes, sir. Our sargent is missing.

57
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:46,588
We're looking for him now. I'll call you
as soon I have any more information.

58
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,050
Chloe, what about satellite?

59
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:51,907
We have coverage of the bus
Numair boarded but it's not continuous.

60
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,471
There are 2 tunnels and three locations

61
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,713
including this one
where the coverage is only partial.

62
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:56,795
Dammit.

63
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:59,001
Numair is a known terrorist

64
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,349
with possible access to suitcase nukes
and he escapes in broad day light.

65
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:05,638
We have to do better than we're doing

66
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,995
and we have to do it faster!

67
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,474
What else do we know
about this prisonner Numair?

68
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,510
He's a nuclear engineer
trained in Germany.

69
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,451
Run a weapons' program outta Frankfurt
up until by 8 years ago

70
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,246
when he moved to the Middle East.

71
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:22,406
How relevant is his training
to the existing systems?

72
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:23,507
He knows it all.

73
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:26,058
And he's up to date. If he gets his
hands on the suitcase nuke

74
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,666
- he can prep it on site.
- I want this at the top of our list.

75
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:31,452
Capturing Numair
is our number-one priority.

76
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,583
We won't be able to set up satellite
parameters and that's to wide.

77
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:38,812
I know...

78
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:46,900
Partition the grid.

79
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,779
Send half to me
and the other half to Morris.

80
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,714
- Morris?
- Just do it.

81
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,188
That's because
we're monitoring the situation.

82
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:56,020
As soon as I have anything
in your on my end

83
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:57,426
I will <i>share</i> it with you.

84
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,145
<i>- As soon as you...</i>
- Yes!

85
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,431
What are you workin' on?

86
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,175
Just setting up the image processing
for CalTrans

87
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,349
- in the area Numair escaped.
- Dobbins can do that.

88
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:09,248
- I need you on something else.
- Now isn't the time to pull rank on me.

89
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,605
Chloe has assigned me a task.
Please find somebody else.

90
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,151
Okay.

91
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,556
Chloe...

92
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:18,204
- What's Morris doing for you?
- What're you talkin' about?

93
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:20,948
I know he says he's on task for you
but I need help with something.

94
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:22,378
He's not doing anything for me.

95
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,124
- Is this a joke?
- You're upset.

96
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,760
Our alert level is as high as it gets
and you're playing games.

97
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,664
If you can't work with me then you quit.

98
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,504
Files are on your system.

99
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,243
Filter them, now.

100
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,067
I will.

101
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,210
So now we have to assume

102
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,157
there is a rogue nuclear weapon
somewhere on American soil

103
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,431
- or there will be soon.
- All agencies are advised

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,791
to proceed into that assumption.

105
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,451
So what are we dealing with, Karen?

106
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:51,956
Suitcase nukes.

107
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:56,222
The term refers to a number of devices
manufactured by the former Soviet Union.

108
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,599
Small enough for one individual to carry

109
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:01,149
and they have a yield
of one kiloton or less.

110
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,855
- Potential damage?
- The kill radius

111
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:05,559
of a typical suitcase nuke
is about a half mile.

112
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,054
The radiations from the blast

113
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:10,000
greatly extends that radius depending on
the prevailing winds

114
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,253
and other weather conditions.

115
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,001
Let's just arrive at the point here,
Karen.

116
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,314
How many casualties
are we talking about?

117
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,340
That depends on the population density.

118
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,444
In a crowded city...

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,170
many thousands would die instantly.

120
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,379
Taking the radiation into account,

121
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,981
the number of deaths
and serious injuries

122
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,310
would multiply
into the hundreds of thousands.

123
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,395
Get me Jack Bauer.

124
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:38,005
Immediately.

125
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,260
There's nothing here.
We're wasting our time.

126
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,999
You keep saying "we".

127
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,510
There's <i>you</i> and there's <i>us<i/>.

128
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,684
There is no "we".

129
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:50,988
Just give it a minute.

130
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,558
Anything not fully incinerated
can provide us with finger prints

131
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:54,660
or traced DNA.

132
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:02,357
- It's Bauer.
<i>- Hold for the President, please.</i>

133
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:05,953
- Yes.
<i>- Sir, Jack Bauer is on the line.</i>

134
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,364
<i>Mr President.</i>

135
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:14,531
I wanted you to know that we're in the
process of verifyin' what Assad told you

136
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,493
- about his peace initiative.
- Good.

137
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,670
So far everything he told us
has been true.

138
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,492
He's given us no reason to doubt him.

139
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,824
I hope you're right.

140
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,857
Listen, I'm also calling because I want
you to take charge of the search

141
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,122
for Fayed and Numair.

142
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,678
- Mr President, I...
- After the way

143
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,859
the country treated you
this morning, Jack, I...

144
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:33,484
Well...

145
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,334
After the way that <i>I</i> treated you,

146
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,537
I know I don't have any right
to ask you anything.

147
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:41,380
But you've been on top
of this situation from the start

148
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:42,992
and I just want to make it official.

149
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:45,158
Mr President, the truth is...

150
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,917
I don't think I'm up to it.

151
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,841
<i>Jack, we are behind the curve, as it is.</i>

152
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,782
But if weren't for your efforts today,
we'd be nowhere.

153
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,312
I need you to lead this search.

154
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,474
Then I'll do my best, sir.

155
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,071
Report to Bill Buchanan at CTU

156
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:07,264
and call me any time
you think it's necessary.

157
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:09,499
- Yes, Mr President.
- Thank you.

158
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:22,002
The President wants me to run the search
for Fayed and Numair.

159
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,498
I can't do this
without your help, Curtis.

160
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:27,786
I need you to accept Assad
as part of this investigation.

161
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:30,288
He knows this people,
he knows what to look for.

162
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,131
He will see things
that you and I would miss.

163
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,397
He knows this people
because he's one of them, Jack.

164
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:35,752
Trust me.

165
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,203
We need his help.

166
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,909
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

167
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,751
Time was you would have seen
through this guy in a minute.

168
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:45,000
What did the Chinese do to you?

169
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,813
Is there something you need to tell me?

170
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,291
Like what?

171
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:53,498
Is there some kind of a history
between you and Assad?

172
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,993
They found this.

173
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,194
- What is it?
- It's a PDA damaged in the blast.

174
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,737
- A message is still readable.
- What's it sayin'?

175
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,505
"Visitor arrived on Thursday."

176
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:08,499
"Visitor" couldn't have been Numair.

177
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,878
- He was still in custody then.
- "Visitor" is a code word

178
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:13,025
used within the cell.
It to refers to weapon.

179
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:14,284
A suitcase nuke.

180
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,997
The message must mean that Fayed
received it last Thursday.

181
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,891
If they had the weapon last thursday,

182
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:21,081
why did they need to get Numair
outta prison now?

183
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,455
He must be key
to making the device operational.

184
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:25,996
Get everything packed up,
we need to go. Move.

185
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,247
Nothing is more important
than finding Fayed and Numair.

186
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you understand me?

187
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,374
Yeah.

188
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,249
- O'Brian.
<i>- Chloe, it's Jack.</i>

189
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,305
<i>I need you to do something</i>

190
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:46,173
for me.
I want you to run a crossed check

191
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:47,985
on Curtis Manning and Assad.

192
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,323
Is this important?
I've got a lot on my plate right now.

193
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,357
Curtis has a problem with Assad,
it's personal.

194
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:55,690
I don't know what it is but I need
to get them to work together. Please.

195
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,497
Okay, I'll do it as soon as I can.

196
00:08:58,398 --> 00:08:59,848
Numair is here.

197
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,499
- My brother.
- Fayed.

198
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,972
- I was starting to worry.
- Yes.

199
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:16,614
The escape went as planned but
I had to be careful crossing the city.

200
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,235
Where is it?

201
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,221
This was the last model
the Soviets produced.

202
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,008
Where are the tools?

203
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,771
You're missing what I need
to reprogram the trigger.

204
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,217
The device will be here soon.

205
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,403
By what means?

206
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:53,458
A young man named Ahmed.
Recent recruit but reliable.

207
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:57,323
Ahmed, we have known you
and your family for so long.

208
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,967
I can't believe you want
to be doing this.

209
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:03,416
It's not what I want to do.
It's what I have to do.

210
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:04,571
I'm a soldier.

211
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:06,462
You said your father
knows nothing of this.

212
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:08,748
When he finds out, will he be proud?

213
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:12,600
- Yes.
<i>- Ahmed.</i>

214
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,589
- I have what you want.
<i>- Good. Now you're going</i>

215
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:16,819
to deliver it to a man named Fayed.

216
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:18,693
<i>- No.</i>
- What?

217
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:21,438
No, I'm not going to deliver it anywhere
until you let my family go.

218
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:23,748
Ray, do what I say or I will shoot them.

219
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:24,964
Well then I will destroy it

220
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:28,056
and I have a feeling the people you're
working for will be very disappointed.

221
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,833
- Listen to me!
- No, no, you listen to me!

222
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:31,349
I just killed a man for this package

223
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:34,480
and I'm not gonna deliver it anywhere
until I know my family is safe.

224
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,058
- I'll release one of them.
- Both of them!

225
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,712
If I do that I have no leverage
and you know it.

226
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:43,001
Decide now. Which one do I release?

227
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:52,738
My son. Release my son.

228
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,171
I will release your wife.

229
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:56,670
- No, I just told you to release my son.
<i>- You just told me</i>

230
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,208
who you value most.

231
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,044
Your wife will call you
and she's clear off the house.

232
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:04,078
Deliver the component
and then I will release your son.

233
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:06,406
That's it, Ray. Don't push your luck.

234
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:09,501
All right. All right, let her go.

235
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,500
Get in the car and drive.

236
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:17,237
And call Ray
and tell him that you're all right.

237
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,174
This is the number that he called from.
Will you remember this?

238
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,453
- Yes.
- Good.

239
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,171
Tell him to call me when you're through.

240
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,286
And understand that if I see any police,

241
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:30,502
I will shoot Scott. Do you understand?

242
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:36,505
I love you.

243
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:40,610
Go!

244
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:03,596
- Gillian.
- Ray?

245
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,384
<i>- Gillian, are you all right?</i>
- I'm fine.

246
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,838
<i>- What about Scott?</i>
- He's still with Ahmed.

247
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,466
He says that if we go to the police
that he's gonna kill Scott.

248
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,159
But do you think that even if we do
what he says that he would...

249
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:15,362
You think he will still kill Scott
when this is over.

250
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,222
I don't know but we-- we can't take
the chance of going to the police.

251
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,030
- We have to handle it ourselves.
- Oh, God!

252
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:22,361
- I don't know.
- Look, I'm gonna deliver the package

253
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,435
like Ahmed said.

254
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:24,788
He already let you go,

255
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,718
so we have to tell ourselves
that he's got no reason to kill Scott.

256
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:29,370
Look...

257
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,882
I'm gonna call Ahmed back.
Do not call the police.

258
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:32,899
Okay.

259
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:35,810
- Honey, I love you.
- I love you.

260
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,605
- Hello.
- Ahmed, I heard from Gillian.

261
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:51,155
<i>Good. Take the package</i>

262
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,332
to 351 Old Mill Road Valencia.

263
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:55,459
Do you know where that is?

264
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,807
- 351, I can find it.
<i>- All right, I will call Fayed</i>

265
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,539
<i>and tell him to expect you
instead of me.</i>

266
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:03,009
Call me when you get there. It shouldn't
take you longer than 30 minutes.

267
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:04,704
- If it does...
- I understand.

268
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:05,895
I'm leaving now.

269
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,925
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

270
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:39,211
A terrorist is holding my son hostage.

271
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,918
I need to speak to the police.

272
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,779
Dammit, Morris.
I didn't want this tab delimited.

273
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:58,093
- I wanted it in tables like I told you.
- I work much faster with tabs.

274
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,922
I thought <i>that</i> is what you'd want.

275
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,257
You know it's not what I wanted.
You're just being an ass.

276
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:04,097
Nobody speaks to me like this.

277
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,318
No? I just did. So what?

278
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,653
- Sit down and get back to work.
- This has got to stop.

279
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:11,053
Everyone is extremely busy and you two
are distracting everyone around you.

280
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:14,058
If you can explain to me how to get
him to follow directions...

281
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,233
You are on a power trip!

282
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,637
You're a bull, mate!

283
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,715
Excuse me.

284
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:19,751
We all know what this is about.

285
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:24,710
Milo, you and me dated a couple of times
before Morris and I got back together.

286
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,044
We saw a couple of good movies...

287
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,308
but we both agreed
that it wasn't really happening.

288
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,183
Yeah.

289
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:32,709
And you...

290
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:35,250
So I dated Milo a couple of times.

291
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:36,487
But I chose you.

292
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,802
So why don't you get over it
and stop trying' to beat him up?

293
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,501
You think this is about my insecurities?

294
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,638
Yeah. Isn't it?

295
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:44,908
No.

296
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,078
Okay, fine.
If you want it in table format,

297
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,399
you'll get it in table format.

298
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,482
Let's just stop
this mad psychotic terrorist bad guy

299
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:53,313
before he detonates a nuke
on Wilshire Boulevard. All right?

300
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:54,591
Thank you.

301
00:14:58,567 --> 00:14:59,804
Sorry about that, mate.

302
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,303
And just for the record...

303
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,471
there's no lingering jealousy

304
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,541
about any films you two
may have seen together.

305
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:09,078
No problem.

306
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,509
- It's Bauer.
<i>- Jack, it's Bill.</i>

307
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:15,220
The police just vetted a call
from a woman

308
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:17,184
who claims her son
is being held by a terrorist.

309
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,255
- Is she credible?
- I'm not sure yet.

310
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,723
She says she was held too
for a couple of hours

311
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:22,896
but she got out somehow.

312
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:25,391
- Is she on the line?
- Yes. Her name is Gillian Wallace.

313
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:26,496
Patch her through.

314
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,092
Mrs. Wallace, this is Bill Buchanan.

315
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,500
I'm transferring you
to one of our men on the field.

316
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,693
- Hello?
- <i>Mrs. Wallace, my name is Jack Bauer.</i>

317
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,645
You said your son is being held
by a terrorist?

318
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,413
Yes. And he's forcing my husband
to deliver a package.

319
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,999
- What kind of package?
- I-I don't know.

320
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:44,140
- Other persons are involved.
- <i>What's the name of the man</i>

321
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,146
- holding your son?
- Ahmed Amar.

322
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,505
Did he mention any other names?

323
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,353
Yes, one. Fayed.

324
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:53,340
Ma'am, how do we reach your husband?

325
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:57,120
You can't,
he isn't carrying his cell phone.

326
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,997
Do you know where he was taking
the package?

327
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,976
No... I'm sorry.

328
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:04,003
Whatever you do,
just don't let them hurt my son.

329
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:05,573
Ma'am, we'll do everything we can.

330
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,661
Stay away from the house.
We'll get back to you.

331
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,749
What do you think, Jack?

332
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:13,749
She knew Fayed's name.
What's the location?

333
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:17,171
North East corner
of Channing and 15th, Grenada Hills.

334
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,396
Where's your nearest TAC team?

335
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,646
They're all over the city.
You're as close as anybody.

336
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,638
- Take your team with you.
- Copy that.

337
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:24,269
We have a lead?

338
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:26,027
Hostage situation in Grenada Hills.

339
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,864
They think it might be tied
to the bombings.

340
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,503
We need to go to 15th and Channing.

341
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,075
We can't take him on tactical mission.

342
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:32,855
We might need him when we get there.

343
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:38,420
All teams, proceed to 15th and Channing
Grenada Hills.

344
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,329
Mr. President.

345
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:44,251
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Ambassador.

346
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,964
- And yourself.
- Please, sit.

347
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:47,500
- How do you do?
- Karen Hayes.

348
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,969
- How do you do?
- Tom Lennox.

349
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:56,964
The events of these past few weeks are
deeply distressing for all of us.

350
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:59,914
If there's anything we can do
to help, please tell me.

351
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,495
You can help right now, Mr. Ambassador.

352
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,666
By having a very candid
conversation with us.

353
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm always candid, Mr. President.

354
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:06,954
Mr. Ambassador...

355
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,420
We've been in contact
with Hamri Al-Assad.

356
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,628
We know that he has been a driving force

357
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,511
behind a number of terrorist attacks
around the country.

358
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:16,990
Around the world
for the past two decades.

359
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:18,693
I know who he is.

360
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:21,533
Assad claims he's renounced terrorism,
Mr. Ambassador.

361
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,533
He says he's willing to negotiate.

362
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,901
To use political means
to gain his ends.

363
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:28,367
You think he's telling the truth?

364
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,991
I have reason to believe
that he is telling the truth.

365
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,878
But how much influence does he have?

366
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,834
Does he speak for a large number
of terrorist organizations?

367
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:38,639
As you know, there are literally
hundreds of such groups.

368
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:41,354
But Assad's reputation is such
that many of them--

369
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,465
not all by any means
but a substantial number--

370
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,753
would follow his lead
at least for a while.

371
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,890
So this really could be a
significant step towards peace?

372
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,871
I sincerely hope so.

373
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:56,419
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

374
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,578
- You've been extremely helpful.
- You're welcome, Mr. President.

375
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,752
- Thank you.
- Mr. Ambassador.

376
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:07,194
So this corroborates
everything Jack told us about Assad.

377
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:10,421
We need to formalize a relationship
with him now.

378
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,103
Lock him into cooperation.

379
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:14,690
- Tom?
- I have problems forming a partnership

380
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:19,376
with a man who is responsible
for the deaths of so many innocents.

381
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:27,077
Is Assad still with Jack Bauer?

382
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:29,799
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get Jack on the phone, please.

383
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,873
- Bauer.
- <i>Hold for the President, please.</i>

384
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,443
- Jack?
- <i>Yes, Mr. President.</i>

385
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,803
Do we have any leads
on that nuclear weapon yet?

386
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,180
One. We're following it up now.

387
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,486
It's too early to tell
if it's going to be meaningful.

388
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,680
All right. Jack, listen.

389
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:48,157
I just had a meeting that confirms
Assad is serious

390
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:50,211
about pursuing this negotiated peace.

391
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,937
And that he does have the influence

392
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,804
with his own people
to make that happen, so...

393
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:55,670
I'd like to come to some
arrangement with him.

394
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,289
- Is he with you now?
- Yes, sir.

395
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:59,017
<i>Let me speak with him, please.</i>

396
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,253
One moment.

397
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:05,184
The President wants to speak to you.

398
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,506
Yes, Mr. President.

399
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:10,964
Mr. Assad, I am prepared
to offer you full protection

400
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:14,204
and a pardon for all crimes
or acts of war in the past.

401
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,885
There are conditions however.

402
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,133
That you continue tracking Abu Fayed

403
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:21,236
and that you pledge your commitment
to establishing a broader peace.

404
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:23,503
- Is that acceptable to you?
- In principle, yes.

405
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,767
Forgive me, Mr. President, but...

406
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,750
I need to see this in writing.

407
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,080
You'll have it within the hour.

408
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,197
Let me speak with Jack, please.

409
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,719
Of course.

410
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,162
Yes, sir.

411
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,091
This was not an easy thing to do, Jack,

412
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,501
but I do believe
the greater good requires it.

413
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:50,636
Do you agree?

414
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,389
I'm glad that's a call
I didn't have to make, sir.

415
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,571
Thank you, Jack.

416
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes, sir.

417
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:01,875
Your President--
do you believe he's an honorable man?

418
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,793
Yes, I do.

419
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,334
Mr. Lennox, excuse me. I have
Sandra Palmer calling for the President

420
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:13,732
but he's on another line.

421
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,067
Could you transfer that call
to my cell phone, please?

422
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:19,434
She specifically asked
to speak to the President.

423
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,834
And do it now, please.

424
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,614
Yes, Sandra? Tom Lennox here.

425
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,721
I need to speak with Wayne,
it's important.

426
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:32,152
I'm afraid the President's
all tied-up at the moment..

427
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,249
Will you please let him know
that I'm on the phone?

428
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:36,465
Actually, the President
asked not to be disturbed.

429
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,730
Is this by any chance concern
your friend Walid?

430
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:41,381
Yes, that's exactly what it's about.

431
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:42,746
He's still in custody.

432
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,290
You continue to arrest innocent people,

433
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,489
you're giving the terrorists
exactly what they want.

434
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,675
With all due respect,
the President is more concerned

435
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:50,724
by the fate of the country

436
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,281
than the fate of one man, Sandra, so...

437
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,727
An innocent man jailed without charges.

438
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,604
If you believe
the fundamental principles

439
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,732
of this country,

440
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:00,035
there is nothing more important
than that.

441
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:03,292
Well, you've got the makings of
a splendid long review article there

442
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,977
and will pass this message
along to the President.

443
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:08,158
- If you'll excuse me, please.
- Mr. Lennox.

444
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:09,809
Pass along another message as well.

445
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,310
What is that, Sandra?

446
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:12,734
<i>I will do whatever it takes</i>

447
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,081
to protect my client.

448
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:16,825
If it embarrasses the administration,
so be it.

449
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,657
Do I detect a threat here?

450
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:20,915
<i>Yes, and so is this:</i>

451
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:24,755
I am holding you personally responsible
for whatever happens to Walid.

452
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:31,084
Next, Sabir Hadad. Sabir Hadad.

453
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:36,456
Walid Al-Rezani.

454
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,997
Is there some place
I can get a drink of water?

455
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:47,962
Brother.

456
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,499
Thank you.

457
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,998
Thank you for helping me earlier.

458
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,998
No problem.

459
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,997
Did you tell them anything?

460
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,113
- Of course not.
- Good.

461
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:13,069
I'll tell you something, brother.

462
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:16,247
Before this day is over,
they'll all pay.

463
00:22:17,696 --> 00:22:19,000
What do you mean?

464
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,053
Salim.

465
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,363
What are you doing?

466
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:26,343
It's all right, he's a friend.

467
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,174
Take-take it easy.

468
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:22,310
I got a package from Ahmed, okay?
Ahmed.

469
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:31,711
Fayed.

470
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,288
- Who is this?
- He says Ahmed sent him.

471
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:37,208
- Your name?
- Ray Wallace.

472
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,507
Ahmed should have called you
and told you I was coming.

473
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,901
You have to call Ahmed
and tell him to let my son go.

474
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,478
- Because we-- had a deal.
- Quiet!

475
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:47,978
Is this what you need
to reprogram the trigger?

476
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,679
Yes, this should work.

477
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:54,991
How long will it take
to complete assembling?

478
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:56,745
20 minutes.

479
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,289
So in a little less than an hour,

480
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,748
it will detonate.

481
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:03,656
A strike of blood that the Americans
will never forget.

482
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,927
You're insane.

483
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,907
Don't kill him.

484
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,634
until you're ready to leave.

485
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:10,827
He still maybe of some use
as a bargaining chip.

486
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:11,995
if something goes wrong.

487
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,180
Look...

488
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,171
My son...

489
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:18,679
He's-- just a boy.

490
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:20,664
Can you call Ahmed
and tell him to let him go?

491
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:22,960
I mean I've done everything
I've been asked to. Please.

492
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:25,850
I may...

493
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:27,974
if you remain cooperative.

494
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,750
I will. I swear.

495
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:34,745
I still have much to do as you know.

496
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:36,145
I have everything I need.

497
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:38,297
When you're finished,
meet me at the safe house.

498
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,313
- Yes.
- Ahmed, it's me.

499
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:49,621
- Did the device arrive?
- Yes.

500
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,751
But it was still wrong
to involve anyone else.

501
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:54,339
I understand and I know
but I-I had to. I had no choice.

502
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:55,459
- I...
- Never mind.

503
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:57,112
It arrived and that's what counts.

504
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:58,419
You have a hostage--

505
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:00,143
- This man's son.
- Yes.

506
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:02,204
- You have no further use for him?
- No.

507
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:06,231
Then leave. Join the others.

508
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,501
But before you go, kill the boy.

509
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:15,210
- Is that necessary?
- <i>Yes.</i>

510
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,297
He's seen and heard too much.

511
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:20,333
<i>You understand?</i>

512
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,745
Yes, Fayed.

513
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:41,017
The pardon for Assad looks satisfactory.

514
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:43,616
- Tell the Attorney General to proceed.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

515
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:47,594
Yes.

516
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,015
Mr. Lennox and Miss Hayes are here.

517
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,162
Show them in.

518
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,147
I've just approved
the written agreement with Assad.

519
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,751
- That was quick.
- It had to be.

520
00:26:00,763 --> 00:26:03,009
We don't have the time
to stand on ceremony.

521
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,501
Tom, I know you disapprove
of this agreement.

522
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:07,253
But you have got to put that behind you.

523
00:26:07,754 --> 00:26:10,545
The issue now is how do we position this
with the public.

524
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:13,840
- It must be kept from the public.
- That's not practicle, Tom.

525
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,063
We will leak out.

526
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:17,576
It's our advantage to make it known
that Assad is on our side.

527
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:19,511
Then don't disclose
the formal agreement.

528
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,736
Don't use the words
"pardon" or "amnesty".

529
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,507
- We're "cooperating".
- I agree.

530
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:25,825
Let's portray Assad as a man
who's not a terrorist,

531
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:28,563
but someone who's renounced terrorism
and wants peace.

532
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:31,026
- Terrorist turned statesman.
- Well, he's not the first

533
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:33,478
The point is saving lives.
That needs to be our focus here.

534
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:35,998
Okay, so for every life
that was lost in the past

535
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,038
because of this man

536
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,836
10 more may be saved in the future

537
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:40,637
by working with him.

538
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:43,378
All right, well on the face of it,
if the logic is compelling.

539
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:46,651
All right, let's make a set of briefing
points and get them to our media people.

540
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:48,628
I'm on it.

541
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,820
I do have to say, Mr President...

542
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:57,748
I still don't like this.

543
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:00,114
I understand.

544
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:03,747
And it makes me appreciate
your loyalty all the more, Tom.

545
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,026
The Wallace kid's
still being held hostage.

546
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,562
Copy that. Curtis...

547
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,658
you and your team
you take the back of the house.

548
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:20,222
You come with me, we'll find
an entrance point from the side.

549
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,390
We'll go on my command.

550
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,730
This is Bauer to all personnel,

551
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:24,846
it is imperative
we take the suspect alive.

552
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:27,118
Right now he's our best chance
of finding the nuke.

553
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,001
Slowly moving into position now.

554
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:37,976
All is clear.

555
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,521
Cover me.

556
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:58,245
Why aren't you talking?

557
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:01,575
What's goin' on?

558
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:04,345
Did my father deliver the package?

559
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:07,994
- Yes.
- Is he okay?

560
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,487
Did he do exactly what you told him?

561
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:12,995
Your father's fine.

562
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,062
So...

563
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,946
Then you can let me go, too.

564
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,438
Get up.

565
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,381
What?

566
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:31,852
Get up!

567
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:34,999
Why?

568
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,057
My father did exactly
what you told him to do.

569
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,326
I swear I...

570
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:47,596
I promise you I won't tell anybody
what I know.

571
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:50,359
Scott, don't make this any harder
than it is. Kneel down.

572
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:56,897
I can't see what's happening
in the house.

573
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:59,043
Does anybody have
a visual on the situation inside?

574
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:01,710
Not yet. My men are almost in position.

575
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:09,362
- Turn around.
- You don't have to do this.

576
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,507
Turn around now!

577
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,366
- Set.
- All teams are set.

578
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,455
Curtis, make the call.

579
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:21,601
I'm sorry, Scott.

580
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:22,999
Go!

581
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:27,926
Freeze!

582
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:33,038
- He's comin' your way, Jack.
- Drop the weapon!

583
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,915
Hold your fire!

584
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,091
Hold fire!

585
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:44,642
- Is he alive?
- Barely.

586
00:29:44,671 --> 00:29:46,564
Get the EMT up here now!

587
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:49,099
I need him conscious to tell us
where he made the boy's father

588
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,181
take the package.

589
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:52,057
Get me an EMT down here now!

590
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:53,932
I'm-I-I might know.

591
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:55,124
Jack!

592
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:57,848
When-when he was on the phone
with my father

593
00:29:57,874 --> 00:30:00,334
he told him to take something
to an address, hum...

594
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:06,000
351 Old Mill Road Valencia.

595
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,990
- Buchanan.
- It's Jack. I think we got an address.

596
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,661
351 Old Mill Road Valencia.

597
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:19,960
<i>Got it.</i>

598
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:21,904
Nadia...

599
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:25,228
Alert the 2 tac teams, we have
a strike target, deploy them there.

600
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:30,997
You gonna save my dad?

601
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:36,887
We'll do everything we can.

602
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:48,047
When you got the satellite feed,
download it to the tac teams.

603
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,660
OK, I think we should get send'em here.

604
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,080
Here is the satellite download
to Fayed's location.

605
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:54,888
They're only from the past 10 minutes
but nobody entered or exited.

606
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,418
What's the exterior layout?

607
00:30:56,614 --> 00:30:58,911
Favorable. Tac teams can approch
without being seen.

608
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:00,594
Nadia, get me the President.

609
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,221
We just don't have
enough specifics to go public.

610
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:06,661
But I still want all 1st response teams
in the Los Angeles area

611
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,801
to be briefed on the possibility
of a nuclear detonation.

612
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:13,712
Excuse me, Mr President, you have
an urgent call from Bill Buchanan.

613
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:14,953
I'll take it.

614
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,055
<i>Mr President, we have some good news.</i>

615
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:21,309
We believe
with a high level of probability

616
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:23,594
- we can find the suitcase nuke.
- <i>Where?</i>

617
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,621
In Valencia, 20 miles north of the city.

618
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:27,520
Tactical teams
will be there in 15 minutes.

619
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:30,525
Would you like me to patch you
into that feed when it's available?

620
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,349
Absolutely, Bill.
Good work.

621
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,008
Thank you, Mr President.

622
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:36,009
I'll let you know
when the feed comes up.

623
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,197
Can we have a moment alone, please?

624
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:51,647
- I'm getting you outta here.
- I'm not going anywhere.

625
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:53,487
- Yes, you are.
- Sandra, listen to me.

626
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:58,026
I think some people in this place have
a connection with the terrorist attacks.

627
00:31:58,153 --> 00:31:59,532
How would you know that?

628
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,136
They were speaking Arabic,
which I don't understand,

629
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,995
but there was one phrase
they used several times.

630
00:32:12,602 --> 00:32:16,292
Pass that on to the FBI or somebody.
It may help

631
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:19,231
They're being held illegally.
Any statement they make

632
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,878
- may not be in...
- Dammit, Sandra!

633
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:23,574
Stop being a lawyer
for one damned minute.

634
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,917
This guys may be planning something
that will harm a lot of people.

635
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:40,772
All right, I'll pass it on.

636
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:45,084
I have to come back.

637
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:47,441
Be carefull.

638
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,334
Yeah, I just got it. Thanks, Bill.

639
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:57,643
Let me know when the tac teams
arrive in Valencia.

640
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,005
<i>Will do, Jack.</i>

641
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:09,500
This represents everything that you
and the President talked about.

642
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,199
You'll receive a full pardon

643
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:14,175
in exchange for your continued efforts
in helping us stop these attacks

644
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,106
and for bringing
your political organization

645
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:17,938
to negociate in peace with the west.

646
00:33:18,003 --> 00:33:19,843
I need a moment
to look through this, please.

647
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:20,892
I understand.

648
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:22,586
Unfortunately I need
to get back to work.

649
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:24,016
Agent Borman will take you to CTU.

650
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:28,195
Good luck.

651
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:29,986
Thank you.

652
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:37,992
Excuse me.

653
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,317
- What's the document?
- Come here.

654
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,555
I wanted to talk to you about this
before it was executed.

655
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,257
I didn't think
it would happen this fast.

656
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:55,328
We made a deal with Assad.

657
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,031
- Who's "we"?
- The United States government.

658
00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:00,166
Personally authorized by the President.

659
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,878
Assad will receive a pardon

660
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,685
in exchange for his full cooperation
which he has given us.

661
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,994
In other words...

662
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,687
he walks.

663
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,507
Like I told the President,
it's not my call.

664
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:13,754
It's not your call either.

665
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:16,179
This possibility lies with him alone.

666
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,240
It's out of our hands.

667
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,526
All right.

668
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:25,133
Then that's the way it has to be.

669
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,511
That's the way it has to be.

670
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,560
Yeah.

671
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:35,973
Scott! Scott...

672
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,955
Oh, God. Are you all right?

673
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:41,946
- I'm fine.
- You're sure?

674
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,818
- Are you ?
- Yes.

675
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:45,094
Miss Wallace?

676
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:46,812
Is there any word of my husband?

677
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:48,850
With your son's help
we think we know where he is.

678
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:49,919
We've got agents on route.

679
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:51,847
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

680
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,543
As soon as they get there, I promise you

681
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:55,409
we'll do everything we can
to protect him.

682
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,650
Excuse me for one second.

683
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,493
- This is Bauer.
- Jack?

684
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,108
You were right about Curtis and Assad
having a past connection.

685
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:04,185
- Go on.
- Curtis was in the army

686
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,674
just after Desert Storm.

687
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:08,516
His squad was embushed
by Assad's people.

688
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:11,441
<i>They killed 5 of Curtis's men
and took 2 more hostage.</i>

689
00:35:11,614 --> 00:35:13,993
Curtis was badly wounded,
he couldn't go after them.

690
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:17,429
<i>The next day a tape was sent
to the local television stations.</i>

691
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,086
Assad's lieutenant forced the men

692
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:21,227
from Curtis's patrol
to beg for their lives

693
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:23,282
and then personally beheaded them both.

694
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,067
Oh, my God!

695
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,454
Jack?

696
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:37,079
I-I'll get back to you.

697
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,836
Where's agent Manning?

698
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:46,388
He was here just a second ago.

699
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:53,583
Borom... Go ahead, I got him.

700
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,498
You still don't remember?

701
00:35:58,746 --> 00:36:00,705
Special Forces batallion...

702
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:03,001
32th support group

703
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:07,428
Curtis, put your weapon down!

704
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:11,315
I can't do that, Jack.

705
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:13,285
By order of the President
of the United States,

706
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:14,888
put your weapon down!

707
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,103
Stay out of it, Jack!

708
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:19,220
I can't.

709
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:21,497
I gave him my word
that we would protect him.

710
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:23,961
I didn't.

711
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,063
Curtis, please. Don't do this.

712
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:32,961
Please.

713
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,364
I can't let this animal live.

714
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:03,159
- Yeah.
- <i>Jack, it's Bill.<i>

715
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:05,239
Spreg told me what happened.

716
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:07,540
<i>Curtis didn't leave you any choice.</i>

717
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,357
That's what
I keep trying to tell myself.

718
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:11,938
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

719
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:13,757
We need Assad alive.

720
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,979
<i>He's on his way back.
I think you should come in, too.</i>

721
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,180
Tell the President I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.

722
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:22,741
<i>The hell you can't.</i>

723
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:25,338
We're gonna find that suitcase nuke
because of you.

724
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,409
<i>Jack, you've done great work today.</i>

725
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,587
Good, then you don't need me anymore.

726
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:32,584
<i>I'll send a car for you, Jack.
Come back here, we'll talk.</i>

727
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,143
I'm done.

728
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:58,181
- Yes ?
- <i>Mr Buchanan, I just received word</i>

729
00:38:58,232 --> 00:39:01,487
that Ahmed Amar, the terrorist who held
the Wallace family hostage,

730
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:03,284
died on route to the hospital.

731
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:06,834
Thank you, Nadia.

732
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,035
Mr Buchanan, the tac team is ready.

733
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:23,103
Patch me in. Make sure the White House
is connected to the feed.

734
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:37,092
<i>Watch your 6.</i>

735
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,477
<i>Here.</i>

736
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,701
<i>- To mode set.
- Go! Go!</i>

737
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,753
Delta unit, move in.

738
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:00,994
<i>Delta movin' in.</i>

739
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:04,498
<i>Offensive, watch it, watch it.</i>

740
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:10,036
<i>Engage!</i>

741
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:20,001
How much longer?

742
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,670
Almost finished.

743
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,391
I just need to reconnect the fuse.

744
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,533
Sabir...

745
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,455
- I think I saw someone out there.
- Who?

746
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:37,892
Police. Somebody. I saw something.

747
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:40,343
- Are you done?
- Yes.

748
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,404
- Can you detonate now?
- Yes.

749
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,931
Right now! Do it!

750
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:00,322
No.

751
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,833
Oh, my God!

752
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:38,179
Alert all fresh response teams

753
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,505
in Los Angeles
and the surrounding counties.

754
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:42,748
Let's put them in touch
with the military.

755
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:43,776
Tell them...

756
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:48,412
Tell them the resources of
the entire nation are at their disposal.

757
00:41:48,431 --> 00:41:50,076
Whatever it is they need.

758
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,065
Karen?

759
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:01,906
Yes, Mr President.

760
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:21,727
Mr Buchanan,
I just got a message from the FBI.

761
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,865
They said it's important.

762
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:27,027
- It's some Arabic phrase.
- What is it?

763
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,808
Someone overheard a conversation
at one of the detention centers.

764
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:30,992
This phrase kept comin' up.

765
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:32,779
I'm not sure about the pronunciation.

766
00:42:37,231 --> 00:42:38,561
It means "five visitors".

767
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:42,772
Assad said
"visitor" was a code word for weapon.

768
00:42:43,634 --> 00:42:45,771
Four more of theses things
are out there.
