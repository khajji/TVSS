1
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:07,834

2
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:12,834

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,533
Fayed has the bombs.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,901
Where is he?

5
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,101
I don't know,

6
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:19,867
but I can help you find him.

7
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:22,368
RYAN:
<i>Preparing the tracker now.</i>

8
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,067
We can track the
isotope signature

9
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:25,067
up to 15 miles.

10
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:26,567
(inhales sharply)

11
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:27,934
MILO:
<i>We are locked</i>
<i>on the isotope signature</i>

12
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,101
that's being emitted
from Gredenko's arm.

13
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,268
You led them to me.

14
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:33,567
I had no choice.

15
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,067
I don't like it.
Something's wrong.

16
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:36,134
I'm heading in.

17
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,700
Which direction, Milo?

18
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,700
He stopped and entered
the building on the left.

19
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:42,967
He's right on the other side
of the door!

20
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:44,234
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,433
He cut off Gredenko's arm!

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,734
Ryan, move your men in now!

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,001
I want Fayed alive!

24
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,301
REPORTER:
But sources indicate

25
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,001
that the same terrorist cell
is most likely...

26
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,400
We're trapped.
This way.

27
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,134
I recognize him from the news!

28
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,567
He's the terrorist
they're looking for!

29
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:58,934
MAN:
That<i>is</i> him!

30
00:00:59,001 --> 00:00:59,967
You bastard.

31
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,700
Back off!

32
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:09,800
<i>Gredenko is not here.</i>

33
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:11,001
<i>I need you to lock down</i>
<i>the area</i>

34
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:11,934
and initiate a search!

35
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,800
One of the Cabinet votes
is invalid.

36
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,334
The tally's seven to six

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,934
in favor of invoking
the 25th amendment

38
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,368
and removing President Palmer
from power.

39
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,134
I'm sorry, Wayne.

40
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,467
No, don't waste your apologies
on me

41
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,767
because I won't let you
steal the presidency.

42
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,134
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,

43
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,867
conspiracy to commit perjury

44
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,834
is a felony offense.

45
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:40,167
LISA:
My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favor

46
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,334
so that you can do what's right
for this country.

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,500
NOAH:
You're right. Do it.

48
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:46,901
Turn it off.

49
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,901
Wayne, the Supreme Court
was just notified.

50
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,368
Daniels withdrew his suit.

51
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,400
You're still the President
of the United States.

52
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:54,867
President Palmer...

53
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:57,067
What?

54
00:01:57,134 --> 00:02:00,001
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

55
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,667
This makes no sense, sir!

56
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,567
It's what you risked your life
to stop!

57
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:07,301
Tom, I risked my life
to reassert my authority.

58
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:08,834
Mr. President...

59
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:11,667
...we have a successful launch.

60
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:12,734
Good.

61
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,567
Mr. President,

62
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,967
the missile is just
entering target's airspace.

63
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,001
Mr. President...

64
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,301
Tom, I said I was
done talking.

65
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,500
We both agreed

66
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,301
a nuclear strike is pointless,
Fayed's actions

67
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,600
are not state-sponsored

68
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,967
and his country
cannot be held

69
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:43,967
accountable for this.

70
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:46,800
Five minutes till impact.

71
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,201
The ambassador assured us

72
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,667
he country is doing
everything possible

73
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:51,967
to find those suitcase nukes.

74
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,667
They simply don't know anything!

75
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,634
Well, one way or another, Tom,

76
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,934
we're about to find out
if that's true.

77
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:04,934
(keypad beeps,
phone rings on line)

78
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,700
Buchanan.
HAYES: Bill, it's me.

79
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,567
Have you gotten anything
from Fayed?

80
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:10,101
Jack's interrogating
him now,

81
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,467
but frankly, he's not
optimistic about breaking him.

82
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,667
What's going on?

83
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:16,567
The president's gone ahead
with the missile strike.

84
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:17,967
He what?

85
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,467
He's launched it, Bill.

86
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,201
Why?
I don't know why.

87
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,567
He fought the vice president
to regain his office,

88
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,567
and now he's just going
ahead with Daniels' plan.

89
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,101
It doesn't make
any sense.

90
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,134
We've got to stop this.

91
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:34,134
Look, can I tell
the president

92
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:37,067
that you have a solid lead
from Fayed on the location

93
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,400
of the suitcase nukes?

94
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,667
If you're asking me
to provide a pretext

95
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,834
to bring the missile down,
Karen, I can't do that.

96
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,301
Fayed's not talking
and Gredenko's dead.

97
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,433
I don't have anything.

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,800
Okay, okay.

99
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,901
I'm sorry.

100
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,634
Me, too.

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,167
I'll call you later.

102
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,734
Sir, we have confirmation

103
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,867
the radar's tagged
the missile.

104
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,934
They're scrambling fighters
and readying air defenses, sir.

105
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,634
Then they know we're coming.
Good.

106
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,867
Sir, I just got off
the phone with CTU.

107
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,167
Bauer's interrogating Fayed.

108
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,400
It's just a matter of time

109
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,001
before he has the location
of those bombs.

110
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,667
No, Karen, we can't afford
to wait longer.

111
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,368
Sir, we can't afford not to.

112
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,800
Please, why are you doing this?

113
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,700
Four minutes to impact,
Mr. President.

114
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,867
Mr. President...

115
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,800
(intercom beeps)

116
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,634
Yes?

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Excuse me. We have the
ambassador on for the President.

118
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,467
This is President Palmer.

119
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,001
Mr. President, my government
has alerted me

120
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,134
of the nuclear weapon heading
toward my country.

121
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,700
That's correct, Mr. Ambassador.

122
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,134
We've made good on our threat.

123
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,400
For God sake, I implore you
to stop it!

124
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,500
On what grounds?

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,268
We have uncovered new
information regarding
your situation.

126
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,234
I'm listening.

127
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,867
We've identified a general
in our Central Command,

128
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,101
General Mohmar Habib,

129
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,167
who has also been in
contact with Fayed.

130
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,934
It's our belief
that he's been helping

131
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,901
orchestrate the attacks
on your country.

132
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,268
Have you arrested Habib?

133
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,700
Yes, yes. He's being
interrogated as we speak.

134
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,934
Please, you must

135
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,867
abort this attack
before it's too late.

136
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:27,167
Does Habib know the present
location of Fayed's

137
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,301
nuclear weapons?

138
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,767
It is my understanding
that the general's

139
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,268
last contact with Fayed
was during the drone operation.

140
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,834
He has no current knowledge
of the weapon's whereabouts

141
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,301
or their intended targets.

142
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:37,634
Mr. President,

143
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,800
two minutes to impact, sir.

144
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,467
Ambassador,

145
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,067
your government has
known about this man

146
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:48,867
for quite some time,
haven't they?

147
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,500
Mr. President, this 
development has come
as a shock...

148
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,134
Stop lying to me!

149
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:56,734
That missile will hit
in less than two minutes,
Mr. Ambassador,

150
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,467
so please don't try
my patience again.

151
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,101
You must understand
the fragile political
climate of our country.

152
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,101
General Habib
is a high-ranking
military commander.

153
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,400
I really hope
protecting this man
was worth pushing us

154
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:11,301
to the brink of
World War III.

155
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,500
The missile will be aborted,
Mr. Ambassador.

156
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,067
But in the meantime,
I strongly suggest

157
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:23,067
you get me a full 
dossier on General Habib.

158
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,567
I want a thorough update

159
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,967
on the progress
of his interrogation.

160
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:28,201
I'm also demanding
that you return here

161
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,567
to the White House immediately.

162
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:32,634
I want direct access
to you, sir,

163
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,667
for the duration
of this crisis.

164
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:36,967
As you wish,
Mr. President.

165
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:44,867
Commander, abort code:
Alpha-Zero-Delta-Nine.

166
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,800
Ditch it in the Gulf.

167
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,634
My God,

168
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,834
they were lying to us
all the time.

169
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,467
Withholding information

170
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,634
and you knew it.

171
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
I suspected it.

172
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:01,567
Well, I'll see that the<i>Vickery</i>
sends a recovery team

173
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:02,667
to retrieve
that nuclear warhead.

174
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,867
That won't be necessary, Tom.

175
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,934
The president
ordered the launch

176
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:09,268
of a secondary missile on board
the<i>Vickery,</i>

177
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:12,134
an unarmed one.

178
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,867
HAYES: What?
This was all a bluff?

179
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,467
The vice president was right.

180
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,700
Well, about one thing, anyway.

181
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,567
That it was going
to take a willingness

182
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,600
to strike back before
getting any real cooperation

183
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:24,967
from their government.

184
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,600
The difference is I wasn't
about to take innocent lives

185
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:28,901
to prove my point.

186
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,901
Now let's get
this information to CTU.

187
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,400
Perhaps it's the key
to breaking Fayed.

188
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
(grunts)

189
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,567
Gah!

190
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,967
This country is planning
a full retaliatory strike

191
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,467
against your people.

192
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,934
Now, I can stop it,
but tell me where the bombs are.

193
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,967
Where are the bombs?!

194
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:00,800
Fayed, this is over.

195
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:01,867
You lost.

196
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:04,167
Save your people.

197
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,001
Just tell me
where the bombs are.

198
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,834
Are you enjoying
yourself, Bauer?

199
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:12,700
As much as you enjoyed
butchering my little brother?

200
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,234
Your brother was responsible
for the death of dozens

201
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:18,201
of innocent lives.

202
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,533
Now you're responsible
for thousands.

203
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:26,268
Trust me, I haven't
begun to enjoy myself.

204
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:29,001
Go ahead.

205
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,301
You'll get nothing from me,
and you know it.

206
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,034
We'll see.

207
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:36,600
(gasps)

208
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,634
(coughing)

209
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:42,234
(whispering):
This is not working.

210
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,067
Let me have a go at him.

211
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,433
No. That's exactly
what he wants.

212
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,201
He knows he's lost.

213
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,201
He wants us to martyr him.
(cell phone ringing)

214
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,433
Hold on.

215
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,500
This is Bauer.

216
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,567
BUCHANAN:
Jack, it's Bill.

217
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,700
What's your status with Fayed?

218
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:58,834
Same as before.

219
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,634
We're getting nowhere.

220
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,301
I just got some new intel
from the White House.

221
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,567
Fayed's government
arrested one of its generals--

222
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,334
Mohmar Habib.

223
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,067
Apparently, he's
been running Fayed,

224
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:10,800
helping him coordinate
the attacks.

225
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,834
Then Habib would know
where Fayed's men are.

226
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,967
Unfortunately not.

227
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,167
He claims there's
been no contact

228
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,268
since the failed
drone attack.

229
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,901
They're interrogating him now.

230
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,567
Well, unless Habib's
going to give us

231
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:20,700
something more useful than that,

232
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,433
we still have no location
for these bombs.

233
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,667
We have to try something
more drastic.

234
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,834
How soon can you have
Fayed ready for transport?

235
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,067
Immediately, but...

236
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,867
You really think
you're going to be

237
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,334
remembered as some great martyr
for your people, Fayed?

238
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah, you blew up
a little city,

239
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,500
and you killed a lot
of people today.

240
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,934
But let's face it,

241
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:42,334
that's going to be of no
real political significance.

242
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,767
Let me tell you
what's going to happen.

243
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,334
Your number two guy,

244
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,201
once he realizes that
you're out of the picture,

245
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:50,334
he's going to take
those remaining suitcase nukes,

246
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,334
and he's going to blow up
a substantial target,

247
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,867
something that's really
going to hurt this country.

248
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,500
And if, by some
chance, he succeeds,

249
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:01,667
<i>he's</i> going to be the
hero of your jihad,

250
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,967
and you will be forgotten.

251
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,201
Is that what you want?

252
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:07,967
(scoffs)

253
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,368
Do you honestly believe

254
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:12,834
you can manipulate me
by playing on my vanity?

255
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,700
I serve the will of God.

256
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,201
No, you don't.

257
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,201
And if you don't believe me,
ask him when you meet him.

258
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,167
(cocks gun)

259
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,567
Agent Doyle, lower your weapon.

260
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,734
I said lower
your weapon!

261
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,301
Buchanan wants us
to transport Fayed

262
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,867
back to CTU.
We don't have time.

263
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,301
His men are probably
on the move.

264
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:35,001
The only way
we're going to break him

265
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,667
is with a
pharmaceutical package.

266
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,067
Burke is standing by.

267
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,334
We don't need Burke.
Just give me some time with him.

268
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
Those are your orders.

269
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,533
Agent Doyle,
do you have a problem?

270
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,368
No problem.

271
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,567
Good.
Get your men ready.

272
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,467
--LENNOX:
Excuse me, sir.
Here's the file on Habib.

273
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,934
Is this the complete dossier
on General Habib?

274
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,467
No, sir.
That's preliminary.

275
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,134
And I was told by
the ambassador's staff

276
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,834
that more will be forthcoming
and will be relayed

277
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,767
concurrently to CTU.

278
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:34,934
Good.

279
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,834
How soon before
the ambassador gets here?

280
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,068
Within 15 minutes.

281
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh, and I spoke with

282
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,500
Secret Service.

283
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,367
They said your sister is on
her way back to the hospital

284
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,434
to be with Walid.

285
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,934
And she's going
to call you soon.

286
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,267
All right.

287
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,567
Thank you.

288
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:54,734
I did want to say,
your handling

289
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,600
of the crisis...
Tom, I know that
you're not happy

290
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,168
that you were kept in
the dark about the bluff.

291
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,734
But the Joint Chiefs
and I agreed

292
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:00,934
to keep the
plan closed.

293
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,600
That's not it.

294
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,967
I just want
to say I'm sorry...

295
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:07,667
I doubted your strength
and your leadership.

296
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,934
It's all right.

297
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,767
Well, respectfully, sir, no...

298
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,001
it's not all right.

299
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,534
Tom...

300
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,567
you and I go back
a long time,

301
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:23,267
so let's be honest
with each other.

302
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,134
You made it no secret
that you believed

303
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,701
the vice president
was better suited

304
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,200
to lead this country
through this crisis.

305
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,667
And I was wrong about that, sir.

306
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:33,101
No, if that missile had
detonated on foreign soil...

307
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,634
Russia, China, every nation
with a nuclear capability

308
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,300
might well have inserted
themselves into this.

309
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,467
No, this could have
been a world war.

310
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,701
Unfortunately, we're already
in a world war, Tom.

311
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,801
It's just taken me some time
to fully realize that.

312
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,600
If it hadn't have been for
Vice President Daniels

313
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,734
initiating that missile launch,

314
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,233
I would have no gambit
to play here.

315
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,734
And the ambassador would never
have come forward

316
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,001
with this intel on Habib.

317
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,567
I'm not David, Tom.

318
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,068
And I never will be.

319
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:03,934
But I am learning that who I am
is not so bad.

320
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,867
Yeah, well, we're all doing
some learning here today,

321
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,467
aren't we, sir?

322
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:11,801
Tom?

323
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:16,734
Daniels withdrew his challenge
to my competency very suddenly.

324
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,001
And from what I know,

325
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:20,168
without any
discernible reason.

326
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,300
Change of heart maybe.

327
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,434
Oh, something
must have changed it.

328
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,333
You have something on him,
don't you?

329
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,701
Sir, as chief of staff,
I'm here to inform you

330
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,200
and also
to protect you.

331
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:39,200
Those jobs don't always
work in combination.

332
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,168
JACK:
We're northbound on Washington.

333
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,168
ETA about 16 minutes.

334
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,567
Tell Agent Burke we're going
to need everything he's got.

335
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,567
Jack, what if this
doesn't work?

336
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,767
I've never found

337
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,667
pharmaceutical torture
all that effective.

338
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,534
I have.

339
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,034
If this is supposed to frighten
me, you're wasting your time.

340
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,467
I won't tell you a thing.

341
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:17,034
Whether you do or not,

342
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,500
I get to watch
you suffer.

343
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,101
Agent Doyle, I don't
want you talking...

344
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,333
Jack!

345
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,634
Watch out!
(tires screech)

346
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,300
Everybody okay?!

347
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,367
DOYLE:
Yeah.

348
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:43,901
They're trying to flank us
on both sides.

349
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,600
We're sitting ducks here.

350
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,001
Try and get Fayed out the back.

351
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:48,168
I'll cover you from this side.

352
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,767
DOYLE:
All right.

353
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,734
(automatic gunfire)

354
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,367
(speaking Arabic)

355
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,767
(yelling in Arabic)

356
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,434
We're clear.

357
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,467
We're clear.

358
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:17,134
Bill, it's Jack,
do you copy?

359
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,734
Bill, do you copy?

360
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,500
We're here, Jack.
The cover team
just picked up Fayed.

361
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,767
You think
he bought it?

362
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,667
We'll know soon enough.

363
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,168
JACK:
Is the A/V feed up yet?

364
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,333
We're almost there.

365
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,500
Agent Doyle, you're bleeding.

366
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,300
Oh, must have cut myself
in the crash.

367
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,034
Mike, do you need
medical assistance?

368
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:48,834
DOYLE:
Uh, negative, it's superficial,
but thanks for your concern.

369
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,634
Jack, I'm patching it
through to you now.

370
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,534
JACK:
Copy that.

371
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,168
JAMAL:
Talit, take evasive measures.

372
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,367
Keep off
the main streets.

373
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,767
(speaking Arabic)

374
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:12,068
My name is Jamal Nasawa.

375
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:13,300
We are with
the Al-Tahireen cell.

376
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,300
General Habib sent us.

377
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,333
The general?

378
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,534
Yes.

379
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,667
How did you find me?

380
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,200
Through contacts the general has

381
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,767
within the American
intelligence community.

382
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,967
He learned of your route
and ordered us to intercept.

383
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,734
He wants us

384
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:28,801
to help you rendezvous
with your men.

385
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,333
(breathing heavily)

386
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,701
Give me a gun.

387
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:42,834
(speaks softly)

388
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,867
I want to speak to him.

389
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:01,867
General Habib.

390
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,267
That's not possible
at the moment.

391
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,567
Why not?

392
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:06,600
The general is under tight
scrutiny by the government.

393
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,134
It's not safe.

394
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,834
He said he'll call us
when he can.

395
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:11,867
Fayed,

396
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,434
where do you want us
to take you?

397
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,467
I'll let you know
after I speak to the general.

398
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,001
As you wish.

399
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,333
Bill, did you copy that?

400
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,101
Fayed's not going anywhere
unless he talks

401
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,333
to General Habib.

402
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,767
I don't know
if I can make that happen, Jack.

403
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,034
We've got to make
that happen.

404
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,934
Otherwise, this play is
going to fall through.

405
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,634
We have no other way
to find the bombs.

406
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:32,701
I'll call
the White House.

407
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:51,901
--I've got Bill
Buchanan on the phone.

408
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:52,967
I'm patching
him through.

409
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,333
Bill, you're on speaker
with Tom Lennox and myself.

410
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,168
So what's the situation?

411
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,300
Jack Bauer wasn't able

412
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,233
to extract any information
from Fayed.

413
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,734
He considered it a dead end.

414
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,534
Consequently, we
implemented a plan intended

415
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
to trick Fayed
into leading us

416
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,867
to the location
of the suitcase nukes.

417
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,200
What sort of plan?

418
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,267
We staged a fake rescue of Fayed

419
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,001
by CTU agents posing as members
of a terrorist cell

420
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,534
with loyalties to Habib.

421
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
We hoped
that Fayed would lead us

422
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,734
to wherever his men
are holed up.

423
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,901
But he hasn't, right?

424
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,400
No, sir.

425
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:29,667
Fayed is stalling until he can
get confirmation from Habib

426
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,001
that these men are
taking orders from him.

427
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:34,600
He wants to speak
to the general, sir.

428
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,367
Habib is still being
interrogated, Bill.

429
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:38,200
We don't yet know how
cooperative he's being

430
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,567
or even if he will be.

431
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:41,200
I appreciate that, sir.

432
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,667
Our agents on the inside
are trying

433
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:45,567
to circumvent Fayed's request,
but Jack believes

434
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,333
Fayed will not lead us
to the location of the nukes

435
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,801
unless he speaks directly
to the general.

436
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,034
Where's the ambassador now?

437
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:54,400
He arrived a
few minutes ago.

438
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,934
Karen Hayes is meeting
him in the lounge.

439
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,634
All right.

440
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:59,901
I'll do my best to put pressure
on the ambassador, Bill.

441
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,434
Maybe they can force
Habib to make that call.

442
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,068
Keep doing what you can
on your end

443
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,001
just in case
I'm not successful.

444
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:07,634
Yes, sir,
we'll keep you apprised.

445
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,901
All right.

446
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,600
You know, sir, if this
ruse isn't working,

447
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,867
our time might be better
served getting the information

448
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,168
out of Fayed by more
conventional means.

449
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:16,801
Tom, if Jack Bauer says
that's a dead end,

450
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,634
then it's a dead end,
and I believe him.

451
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,834
Let's not keep
the ambassador waiting.

452
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:24,068
Oh! Are you all
right, sir?

453
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,634
I'm fine.

454
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:41,667
Ambassador.

455
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,001
Mr. President.

456
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:45,034
The Prime Minister has asked
me to convey his gratitude

457
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:48,034
to you for stopping the attack
on our country and his relief

458
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:50,434
that an international
catastrophe was
narrowly avoided.

459
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,134
Well, don't get
too comfortable,

460
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Mr. Ambassador,
because there may be one yet.

461
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,634
Sit down.

462
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,434
Let me get right to the point.

463
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:06,200
At this very moment,
Abu Fayed is traveling

464
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,333
with a team of CTU agents
posing as a terrorist cell

465
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,701
allied with General Habib.

466
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:12,168
You have Fayed?

467
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,434
Yeah, we do, but we don't
have the suitcase nukes.

468
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
The problem is Fayed
will not rendezvous with his men

469
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,333
until he speaks to that
general, presumably to confirm

470
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,667
the legitimacy
of our undercover agents.

471
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,967
So we need that phone call
to take place now.

472
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,068
I appreciate your dilemma,
Mr. President,

473
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,034
and I will gladly
pass on your request.

474
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,300
But I'm not sure
the general would
be accommodating.

475
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:35,300
He's proven to be quite stubborn
throughout his interrogation.

476
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:37,867
Well, perhaps you should be
a little bit more persuasive.

477
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:39,600
I resent your tone.

478
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,134
I don't need you to tell me

479
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,367
how dire the situation is.

480
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,001
This is not a moment
for your indignation,

481
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,734
considering
it's your country's

482
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:48,200
own inactions that have brought
us to this point.

483
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,467
I can assure you,
every effort is being made

484
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:51,967
to get information
from him.

485
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,034
We have even
arrested his family.

486
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:57,400
Have you threatened
to kill them?

487
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,434
I beg your pardon?

488
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,701
Mr. President...

489
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:04,834
These are desperate times
for us, Mr. Ambassador.

490
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,101
I spared your country

491
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,001
a nuclear strike that
would have killed thousands.

492
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,200
What is your country
willing to do

493
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:11,901
to insure that
another bomb

494
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,400
does not go off in mine?

495
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:14,867
What you're suggesting
is barbaric.

496
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,168
I'm fully aware

497
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,667
of how your country treats
political dissidents.

498
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:21,168
So don't you dare
speak to me of barbarism.

499
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,467
Now I don't care
how you do it,

500
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:26,834
but General Habib
needs to call Fayed

501
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,134
and give him his orders

502
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
directly without
compromising CTU's operation.

503
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:37,367
You'll make the call now.

504
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,267
Nadia...

505
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,367
if General Habib makes
the call,

506
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:51,967
it'll be to
Jamal's phone,

507
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,367
but the general
doesn't speak English.

508
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:54,734
I'll set up a
separate channel

509
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:56,300
and translate
their conversation.

510
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,634
Milo, I need you to uplink
a proprietary channel

511
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,134
on socket D to my terminal.

512
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,101
I can't. I'm busy.

513
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,967
Why don't you just
do it yourself?

514
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,534
Because I don't have level five
security clearance.

515
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,867
Hasn't stopped you before,
now, has it?

516
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,034
Milo, is there something
on your mind?

517
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:20,634
I just don't get it.

518
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:23,867
A few hours ago, Doyle was
threatening you, hurting you.

519
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,967
You were barely talking
to me and now, what, you
two are best buddies?

520
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:29,367
Just because I showed concern
for an injured field agent
Concern...?

521
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,500
doesn't make us friends.

522
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:32,801
Milo, besides,

523
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,801
he might not as bad
as you think he is.

524
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,967
No. He is.

525
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,267
The guy is a creep
and a sadist.

526
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,634
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

527
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,101
I can have Chloe do it.
It's fine.

528
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:43,034
Wait, that's it? That's
all you're going to say?

529
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,667
Let go of me.

530
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,333
Psst.

531
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,534
I know it's none of my business,

532
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,367
but do we have
a bit of a problem?

533
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,068
No.

534
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,500
I'll set up your channel.

535
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,967
Thank you.

536
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,068
You all right, love?

537
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:17,034
Yeah. Thanks.

538
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,934
Don't mention it.

539
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,101
(labored breathing)

540
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:33,134
Pull into that garage up there.

541
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,834
We'll wait there.

542
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,333
JACK:
Stop right up here.

543
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:02,034
Fayed, I understand
your caution.

544
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,567
But we can't just sit
here while the Americans

545
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,168
are looking for us.

546
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:09,233
I told you-- we're not going any
further until the general calls.

547
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,634
Tell me, Jamal.

548
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:19,767
FAYED: If you take your orders
from General Habib as I do,

549
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,434
how is it I've never heard
of you or your cell?

550
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,267
This is going south, Jack.

551
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,500
Just be patient.

552
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,767
Don't be a fool, Fayed.

553
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,101
You know how this works.

554
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,634
Every cell is autonomous,

555
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,567
without the knowledge
of what the others are doing.

556
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,634
It is the only way
that we can protect ourselves

557
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,934
and our operations
should any of us get captured.

558
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,267
(phone rings)

559
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:40,267
Yes?

560
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,467
(speaking Arabic)

561
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,701
The general.

562
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,834
<i>Alloo?</i>
HABIB:
Fayed...

563
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:58,134
(speaking Arabic)

564
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,101
NADIA (over radio):
"Fayed, I can't speak long.

565
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:01,834
I suspect I'm being watched."

566
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,434
(Fayed speaking Arabic)
"So I was told."

567
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,434
General...
"General..."

568
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,634
"these men who rescued me,
did you send them?"

569
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:15,600
(speaking harshly in Arabic)

570
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,233
"Of course I sent them."

571
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,500
"Do you still
have the bombs?"

572
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,534
(speaking Arabic)
"There are two left.

573
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,667
They're with Halil
at a safe house."

574
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,734
(Habib speaking Arabic)
"Why haven't you used them?"

575
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:29,400
(Fayed speaking Arabic)

576
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,801
"The Russian Gredenko
failed to provide us

577
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,967
with the means to
a secondary target."

578
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,767
(speaking Arabic)

579
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,567
"You failed, Fayed."

580
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:40,467
(speaking Arabic)

581
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,701
"I should have sent Sameer
in your place."

582
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,500
(speaking Arabic)

583
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,367
"Are the bombs operational?"

584
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:50,367
"They are."

585
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,233
"Good."

586
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,834
"Connect with your men,

587
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:57,901
"get the bombs
ready to move out,

588
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,333
"call me back
at this number.

589
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,300
"By then, I will have chosen
a new target for you.

590
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,500
Do you understand?"

591
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:05,734
<i>Na'am, General.</i>

592
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:06,934
"Yes, General."

593
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,967
Are we good?

594
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,233
The safe house isn't far.

595
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,001
Head east toward
the 110 Freeway.

596
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,934
Target vehicle is moving.

597
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:22,001
Copy that, Jack.
Looks like it worked.

598
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:23,867
I'll let the White House know.

599
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:35,001
Let's go.

600
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,200
Mr. President?

601
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:53,434
Are you feeling
all right?

602
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,567
I'm fine, Karen.

603
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:59,734
Just a...
just a little tired.

604
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,667
Mr. President,
I just got word from CTU.

605
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,567
The general's phone call appears
to have satisfied Fayed.

606
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,767
He's leading them
to the safe house and the bombs.

607
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,267
Oh, thank God.

608
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:12,467
I'm pleased we were able
to help, Mr. President.

609
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:13,734
(Wayne clears throat)

610
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,734
(strained):
So am I.

611
00:28:15,801 --> 00:28:17,001
Karen, would you please show
the ambassador

612
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,168
to his car.

613
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,867
Yes, Mr. President.

614
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:22,333
AMBASSADOR:
Forgive me, Mr. President,
but I believe you asked me

615
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,801
to remain here
until the crisis is resolved.

616
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,333
That won't be necessary
any longer.

617
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,200
Thank you again
for your cooperation.

618
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:29,500
Of course,
Mr. President.

619
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:38,134
You handled him well, sir.

620
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,367
(strained):
The door, Tom.

621
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:40,667
Excuse me, sir?
What...?

622
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,934
The door, lock it.
Mr. President...

623
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,734
No one can know.
Sir!

624
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,634
--All shadow teams
for Bauer and Doyle

625
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,000
have checked in
and are standing by.

626
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,134
They're ready to advance

627
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,933
the moment Fayed arrives
at the safe house.

628
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,267
No one moves until Jack calls
with confirmation

629
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,534
that the nukes are there.

630
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:15,301
Make sure Fayed's vehicle

631
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:16,734
and the follow car
have a wide berth.

632
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,833
No choppers in the area.
Nothing to tip Fayed off.

633
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Right.

634
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,401
Sir...

635
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,067
I think we have a problem.
What is it?

636
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:25,567
I analyzed the transcript
between General Habib and Fayed.

637
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:27,100
There's an
inconsistency.

638
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,301
During the conversation,

639
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,800
the general mentioned
a man named Sameer.

640
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:31,401
That's right.
According to the
inter-agency database,

641
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:33,200
a Sameer Al-Afted served
on the general's staff

642
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,534
throughout the '90s.

643
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,668
He was later implicated
in money laundering

644
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,167
for various radical
organizations.

645
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,100
Well, that's probably the guy.

646
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,267
Yeah, well, the problem is,
Sameer Al-Afted was killed

647
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:44,334
two years ago in a raid
by Afghan forces.

648
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:47,634
But the general spoke about
him as if he were alive.

649
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,000
Okay, he could be referring
to another Sameer.

650
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,634
Or it could be a code.

651
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,701
I think the general
was trying to tell Fayed

652
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,234
that he was speaking
under duress.

653
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:57,768
I'd better warn
Jack and Doyle.

654
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,567
Nadia...

655
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,000
Good work.

656
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,567
Jack...

657
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:07,000
they're turning north
onto Adams.

658
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,067
Jack, we just detected
what might be a duress code

659
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:11,634
in the conversation between
General Habib and Fayed.

660
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,167
Give us the specifics.

661
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:16,434
The general mentioned sending
in a man named Sameer Al-Afted.

662
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:18,434
But Sameer's been dead
for two years.

663
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,367
Give me your phone,
we need to call Jamal.

664
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:25,833
Jack, if they're wrong,
you could blow this.

665
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,200
If they're right,
this is already over.

666
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,000
Now give me your phone!

667
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,100
(phone rings)

668
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,967
Yes?

669
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:40,234
JACK:
Jamal, this is Agent Bauer.

670
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:41,701
I'm in the follow vehicle
behind you.

671
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:44,467
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

672
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:45,367
Go ahead.

673
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:46,668
We believe that General Habib

674
00:30:46,734 --> 00:30:48,668
may have given Fayed
a duress signal.

675
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:51,734
Fayed might know
that this is a setup.

676
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,634
Jamal? Jamal, do you copy?

677
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,401
(static crackling)

678
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,000
Damn it, what the
hell just happened?

679
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,701
CTU, we just lost
video and audio.

680
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:04,134
They went into a tunnel
about a quarter of a mile ahead.

681
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
It may just be interference.

682
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,401
How long is it?

683
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,668
Checking.

684
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,301
It's only 120 yards long.

685
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,933
They should've come out
the other side by now.

686
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,668
Copy that.
Aerial One, this is Jack Bauer.

687
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:15,800
We have lost the target vehicle.

688
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,467
It entered a tunnel on Adams.

689
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,734
We need you to seal off
the north end. We're going in.

690
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,501
PILOT:
Roger. On our way.

691
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,701
We got a visual on
the target vehicle.

692
00:31:31,768 --> 00:31:33,234
It stopped in the middle
of the tunnel.

693
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:34,334
We're going to engage.

694
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,267
(tires screeching)

695
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,467
Now.

696
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:57,367
Dead.

697
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:58,434
They're both dead.

698
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,301
Jamal's still alive.
Stay with him.

699
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,800
Call in a medic.

700
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,567
Aerial One, did you see anything

701
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:05,734
leave the north end
of the tunnel?

702
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,267
Aerial One, do you copy?

703
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:09,267
(door slams)

704
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:35,267
* *

705
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,301
(grunting)

706
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,434
(panting)

707
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:56,000
It's me. I'm on my way
to you now.

708
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,334
I'll explain when I get there.

709
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:12,100
(gears grinding)

710
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:37,401
(engine roaring)
Bill, it's Jack! Do you copy?!

711
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,701
Jack, go ahead.

712
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,467
Fayed is in a sanitation truck
headed east!

713
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:45,367
Jack, say again.
We didn't get that.

714
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:49,034
Damn it!

715
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,967
(transmission static)

716
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,567
Jack?
(static continues)

717
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:53,734
Jack?

718
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,334
The signal's gone.

719
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:56,701
There's no contact
from Agent Doyle.

720
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,234
Aerial One says they're still
inside the tunnel.

721
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:00,301
Send the call
to audio forensics,

722
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:01,967
see if they can pull
what Jack said.

723
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,401
Chloe, replay the
satellite feed.

724
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,234
Back-time it 60 seconds.

725
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,167
Yes, sir.

726
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,534
Bill, this is Doyle.

727
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:13,967
I don't have
a twenty on Jack.

728
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:16,933
But I have a dead
body at the loading dock.

729
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:46,334
--Doctor, what is
happening to him?

730
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:48,067
His blood
pressure's dropped.

731
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:49,900
It's 80/40.

732
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,401
It could be any
number of things:

733
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:54,234
vascular damage from
the adrenaline shot,

734
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,767
intracranial swelling...
Mr. President?

735
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,000
We have to get you
down to Medical.
No.

736
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,668
No, I'm not going anywhere.

737
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,700
(groaning)

738
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:06,700
Just give me another
shot of adrenaline.

739
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,067
No, sir.

740
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:11,568
Another injection
would kill you.

741
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,034
I should never
have given you

742
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,668
that last one. I won't make
that mistake again, I'm sorry.

743
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:25,700
Sir, what are you doing?

744
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,367
I'm going back to work.

745
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:29,434
Would you please
listen to this man.

746
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:30,900
Let him perform some tests.

747
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:33,401
When this crisis is over, Tom,
and those nukes are secured.

748
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,134
In my opinion,
you won't last that long.

749
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:36,767
I might surprise you.

750
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:42,401
Mr. President...

751
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:43,867
if you don't get down
to Medical right now,

752
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,301
you can have my resignation.

753
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,634
I won't accept your resignation,
Arthur, so don't bother.

754
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,034
Now, please...

755
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,700
will you excuse us?

756
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,100
(labored breathing)

757
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,833
(whispering):
For God's sake,

758
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,234
talk some sense
into him, Tom.

759
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:05,733
It is his decision.

760
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:14,800
Tom...

761
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:16,733
call CTU.

762
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,467
I want to know
what's happening.

763
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:21,501
All right, sir.

764
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:24,000
All right.

765
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
HALIL:
What's going on, Brother Fayed?

766
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,167
What happened?

767
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:06,900
FAYED:
Gredenko betrayed us.

768
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,967
He led CTU right to me.
What?!

769
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:12,201
They may be tracking me.
It's not safe here.

770
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,900
Load the bombs onto the truck.
We're leaving.

771
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,134
Where are we going?

772
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,467
To finish this.

773
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,000
We're going to take out
downtown Los Angeles.

774
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,401
Let's move!

775
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,900
You wait here.

776
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,601
You guys, come with me.

777
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:33,934
(bones cracking, low groaning)

778
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,900
(gate and chains rattle)

779
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:15,767
(Fayed speaking Arabic)

780
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:33,800
(three gunshots)

781
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:39,467
(gunfire, men shouting)

782
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,301
(groaning)

783
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
(both grunting, shouting)

784
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,833
(groaning)

785
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,467
(grunting)

786
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:14,634
(pained shouting)

787
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:18,534
(pained groaning)

788
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,934
Say hello to your brother.

789
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:35,800
(choking)

790
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,767
(helicopter blades whirring)

791
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,867
Jack? Jack?

792
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:14,900
(panting)

793
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,601
You all right?

794
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:19,067
Yeah. I'm fine.

795
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:20,367
How'd you find me?

796
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,700
Well, we tracked the
sanitation truck by satellite.

797
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,733
Bombs are on the table.

798
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,234
CTU, this is Doyle.
We're on site.

799
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:32,733
The bombs are secure,

800
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,467
and Jack's all right.

801
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,501
Repeat, the bombs are secure.

802
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,100
Damn, Jack.

803
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,134
Let's get you to Medical.

804
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:54,967
(groaning):
I'm fine.

805
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,000
(cell phone ringing)

806
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:59,934
Doyle.

807
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:06,467
(chamber clicks)

808
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,000
You got a call.

809
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:12,501

00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:14,534
Thanks.

811
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:18,934
This is Bauer.

812
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,867
Hello? Hello?

813
00:42:21,934 --> 00:42:24,201
WOMAN (over phone):
Jack...

814
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:26,167
are you there?

815
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,100
Can you hear me?

816
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,100
Audrey?

817
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,467
Help me, Jack.

818
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,833
Please, help me. You...

819
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,100
What the hell is going on?
Audrey, where are you?

CHENG:
Hello, Mr. Bauer.

821
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,167
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive.

822
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:43,800
If you wish her
to remain that way,

823
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:45,634
you will call me back
in ten minutes

824
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,501
at 310-597-3781

825
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,301
on a secure line.

826
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:54,568
If you make any attempt
to find our location,

827
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,100
she dies.

828
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,134
Cheng... Cheng!
