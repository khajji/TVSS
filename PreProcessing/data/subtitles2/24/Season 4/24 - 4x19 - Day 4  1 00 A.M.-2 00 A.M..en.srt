Previously On 24

6
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:14,605
There's a convoy missing.

7
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,820
It was headed from Illinois
to Jefferson City, Iowa.

8
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:19,633
It disappeared just inside the border.

9
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:20,260
Disappeared?

10
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,316
They were due to call in at
that checkpoint every 20 minutes.

11
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:23,408
They didn't.

12
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:24,797
I tried to reach them
through comsat.

13
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,705
There was no reply.

14
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:26,657
What was on the trucks?

15
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:28,303
A nuclear warhead.

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:29,763
They found us.

17
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:30,408
Where are you?

18
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,196
It doesn't matter.

19
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:32,703
It's over.

20
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:34,114
They already got us.

21
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,067
You have to kill Prado.

22
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:36,351
He knows too much.

23
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:40,786
Drop the gun!

24
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:41,678
Drop the gun now!

25
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:42,536
Put the gun down!

26
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,322
Who are you?

27
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:45,433
My name's Joe Prado.

28
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:46,380
I'm innocent.

29
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:49,084
Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated.

30
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:50,351
Take me to him now.

31
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:51,542
We have no choice, Curtis.

32
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:52,360
Do what he says.

33
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:53,929
There's a nuclear warhead missing.

34
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:55,142
This is our only lead, Bill.

35
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,343
What the hell's going on here?

36
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:57,907
You've got a key witness
on a missing warhead.

37
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:59,874
We should be pressing this
guy with everything we've got.

38
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:01,411
Jack, it's Mike Novick.

39
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:03,373
Mike, if we want to procure
any information from the

40
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:05,334
suspect, we're going to have
to do it behind closed doors.

41
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,091
You're talking about torturing this man?

42
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:09,241
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to

43
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:11,094
stop this warhead from
being used against us.

44
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:14,674
All right, gentlemen, I'll have
an answer for you in 20 minutes.

45
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:17,695
Mr. President, this thing
could be over in 20 minutes.

46
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:19,741
What if I could find another way to handle

47
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,471
this that wouldn't
implicate anyone else but me?

48
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:23,308
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack.

49
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,458
You don't have to.

50
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:25,755
What do you mean?

51
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:27,546
Accept my resignation.

52
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,216
And if I do that, what then?

53
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:30,542
Release the suspect.

54
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,976
Now you're throwing me out?

55
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:33,106
That's right.

56
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:37,219
Make a sound and I will blow your
brains out all over the windshield.

57
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,197
Where is he?!

58
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,227
I don't know!

59
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:40,222
Where is he now?!

60
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:41,616
Where's Marwan?!

61
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,431
Okay, okay, okay.

62
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:44,005
Marwan's...

63
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:46,804
Marwan's going to be at a place
called the hub club tonight.

64
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:47,531
Where is it?

65
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,783
It's...

66
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:49,925
It's...

67
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,517
Where is it?!

68
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,111
It's just east of downtown!

69
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,402
This will help you with the pain.

70
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:05,513
The following takes place
between 1:00 A.M. and 2:00 A.M.

71
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,900
Put me through to the White House.

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,100
President Logan?

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
No, not the president.

74
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:28,765
Mike Novick.

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
One Moment Please.

76
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm sorry we're trying to locate Mr. Novick.

77
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,400
Call me when you've got him on the line.

78
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes sir.

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,300
What happened?

80
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,300
Prado talked.

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Who did this?

82
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Audrey...

83
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm a representative of DOD.

84
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,300
I have a right to know, Bill.

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Did Jack do this?

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes, he did.

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
It was the only way to get him
to give up Marwan's location.

88
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,800
So President Logan gave Jack
the authority to use force?

89
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,500
No, Audrey, the president didn't.

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,100
Where's Jack now?

91
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
He's prepping a team to apprehend Marwan.

92
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,100
Curtis, Castle told me
you want to utilize LAPD?

93
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,900
I'm having them lock down
a ten-block perimeter.

94
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
I don't think that's the right call.

95
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,665
Marwan's people are coming and going.

96
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,800
We lock down that area, we
just give them a heads up.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,265
All right.

98
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,200
We'll stay invisible.

99
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Excuse me for one sec.

100
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,900
What is it?

101
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,200
I just came from the clinic where they're
treating Prado for a multiple injuries?

102
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,400
Audrey, what do you expect me to do?

103
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Marwan has a nuclear warhead and he's
going to use it, unless we find him first.

104
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,765
I understand the situation, Jack.

105
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Then you know what I did
was absolutely necessary.

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
At least now we know where he is.

107
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,976
Logan gave you a direct
order not to use extreme

108
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,400
interrogation measures
without his authorization.

109
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,600
Jack, you are acting against the president.

110
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,400
I know.

111
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,300
Jack, we're set.

112
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
I'll be right there.

113
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
All right, everyone, let's move out!

114
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,200
I've got to go.

115
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,700
Jack, you can't keep working outside
the line and not expect consequences.

116
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,100
Trust me.

117
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
No one understands the
consequences better than me.

118
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,400
No one.

119
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,100
You okay?

120
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,600
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Just asking.

122
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,500
I'm fine.

124
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,500
Look, for whatever it's worth,
you did the right thing with Prado.

125
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,300
Thanks.

126
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,242
Authorizing the torture of a
foreign national is one thing, but

127
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:00,215
torturing a U.S.Citizen... I can't...

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Sir,

129
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,100
this man Prado has information on
the whereabouts of a nuclear warhead.

130
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:08,700
We don't know that for sure, Mike.

131
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,765
No, sir, we don't.

132
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Because you're not letting
CTU do what they need to do.

133
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,500
I want to wait till the attorney
general gets back to me with an opinion.

134
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,000
Mr. President, we are running out of time.

135
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,500
Walt, you were the first one
to raise an objection to this.

136
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
What do you think now?

137
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
I think you need to make a decision, sir.

138
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,700
And sooner rather than later.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mr. Novick, Bill Buchanan's
on the phone from CTU.

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,100
He's called twice. It's urgent.

141
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll be right there.

142
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:45,800
Yes.

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,200
What should I tell him?

144
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,875
Mr. President...?

145
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,200
Stop pressing me for an
answer I'm not ready to give!

146
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,100
I need more time.

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,398
I'm sorry for the delay, Bill, but the

148
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,500
president is still working
through his decision.

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
The president won't have
to make that call, Mike.

150
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,100
What are you talking about?

151
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,200
Prado gave up Marwan's location.

152
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,500
I thought Prado claimed
he didn't know anything.

153
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,700
He did.

154
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,000
He changed his mind.

155
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
You mean Bauer physically coerced him.

156
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,600
Tell me what happened, chapter and verse.

157
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,965
Mike, Bauer got the information we needed.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,100
I think it's best if I
insulate you from the details.

159
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,050
The president gave explicit orders.

160
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,900
You should have restrained Bauer.

161
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,100
With all due respect, restraint is
a luxury we can't afford right now.

162
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
What am I supposed to tell the president?

163
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,294
Convince him to sign off on
the extreme interrogation,

164
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,600
and we'll cheat the timeline
in the official record.

165
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,317
I made the mistake of deceiving one

166
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:15,000
president; I won't make
the same mistake twice.

167
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Even though we both know Bauer was right?

168
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,600
Mike...

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Someone out there has one
of our nuclear warheads.

170
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,400
May I speak off the record?

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,900
Go ahead.

172
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
I'm worried about President Logan.

173
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,300
Worried?

174
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,400
Why?

175
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,500
His behavior over the last few hours..

176
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,900
I'm concerned about his ability
to lead us through this crisis.

177
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,100
I understand.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes?

179
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,500
Where are you?

180
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,765
At the Iowa location.

181
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,000
We just arrived with the package.

182
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Has Sabir done the compatibility check?

183
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,600
Not yet.

184
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,800
Call me as soon as he's finished, and I'll
have the next payment wired to your account.

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Is it compatible?

186
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,900
I'll need to reconfigure
the trigger mechanism.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,300
Is it compatible?

188
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,800
Yes.

189
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
How long will that take?

190
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,350
An hour.

191
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,100
Maybe less.

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,000
Then you should start.

193
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,000
My girlfriend.

194
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
She'll leave a message.

195
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,065
She's already left three messages.

196
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,400
I don't want her calling around for me.

197
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Take the call, but hurry up.

198
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,765
Nabila?

199
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,700
Where are you, Sabir?

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
It's the middle of the night.

201
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,800
I asked you where you are.

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,950
At the hotel.

203
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:20,900
Stop lying to me.

204
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,465
I called.

205
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
You never checked in.

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Tell me what you're doing.

207
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
Nabila, I can't talk about this now.

208
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,700
Get some sleep, and I'll
explain everything tomorrow.

209
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
You mean after you've had time
to come up with another lie?

210
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,500
I found something on your computer, Sabir.

211
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,200
A bookmark.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Do you have something to do
with what's been happening today?

213
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,700
How can you ask that?

214
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,500
Are you working with these terrorists?

215
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:45,500
Of course not.

216
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,400
You know I'm not a violent man.

217
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,800
I know your politics.

218
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,765
Nabila, enough.

219
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,900
Stop talking nonsense.

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Is it nonsense?

221
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,500
Like I said, I'll explain things tomorrow.

222
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:56,700
Sabir, listen to me.

223
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,000
She's fine.

224
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,100
Don't worry.

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,448
I want schematics on the
nightclub, options for a

226
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,100
staging area, and let county
know we need traffic control.

227
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Thank you.

228
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Bill, how could you let Jack torture Prado?

229
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,200
Audrey, it had to be done.

230
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
The president made it very clear that
he didn't want Prado's rights violated.

231
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,200
That's right, he did make
it clear, and he was wrong.

232
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,820
We can't just break protocol
because we think it's

233
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:27,800
right at the time and
expect to get away with it.

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,950
Normally, I'd agree with
you, but in this case,

235
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:31,900
I'd rather ask for
forgiveness than permission.

236
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,300
What kind of answer is that?

237
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
The answer is it worked.

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,700
We got Marwan's location.

239
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,000
Audrey, will all due respect,
this is not Washington, D.C.

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Policy and politics do not always work on
the front line, which is where we are today.

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,500
Yes, well, Charles Logan is a politician,
and he is not going to give you forgiveness.

242
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,700
I hope this does not come
back to haunt you or Jack.

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,900
If what we did gets us to
Marwan, we'll live with it.

244
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,500
What is it?

245
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,300
CTU located Marwan.

246
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
They've sent a tactical team to grab him.

247
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,200
That's good news.

248
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,800
But I'm curious how they
obtained Marwan's location.

249
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,500
Did they use force?

250
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,291
Yes, sir, I believe force was
used, but I'm sure I don't need

251
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:41,900
to remind you that this is an
extremely time-sensitive situation.

252
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,000
Who's responsible, Mike?

253
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm asking you a question, Mike.

254
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:48,700
Who did this?

255
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Jack Bauer.

256
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm the President of the United States!

257
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,627
I can't allow this kind
of insubordination to

258
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,800
go unanswered, especially
in a time of crisis!

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,800
I want Bauer arrested.

260
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,502
I agree that that should
happen, sir, but I think

261
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:14,000
we should wait until we
have Marwan in custody.

262
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:17,100
No, I want him arrested now.

263
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,400
Sir, Bauer is heading the field operation.

264
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,100
Jack Bauer is not the only
man that can do the job!

265
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:24,100
Put someone else in charge!

266
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,100
Mr. President...

267
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,450
Get me secret service!

268
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,700
Yes, Mr. President.

269
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,900
Has Jack set the robotic camera in position?

270
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
It should be ready in a few minutes.

271
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,500
We're set to receive.

272
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:39,300
Thanks, Curtis.

273
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,200
Get this to Audrey Raines and
have her stream it to DOD, please.

274
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Buchanan.

275
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,165
Bill, it's Mike Novick.

276
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,900
I just got out of a room
with president Logan.

277
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,700
He knows how we got the
information from Prado.

278
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,200
How did he find that out?

279
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,500
He's not a stupid man, Bill,
and I'm not going to lie to him.

280
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, you'll just have to convince
him to leave it alone then.

281
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,465
I tried.

282
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,000
He's not going to leave it alone.

283
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,100
Fine.

284
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,865
Tomorrow he can bring charges against me.

285
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,100
Right now, I have to get back to
the business of finding Marwan.

286
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,500
It's not tomorrow and it's not you.

287
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,800
What does that mean?

288
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,000
He wants Jack Bauer arrested.

289
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,100
Arrested?!

290
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,000
Mike...

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Jack is heading up the team
that's trying to bring in Marwan.

292
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,900
We're aware of that.

293
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,465
Logan's adamant.

294
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
He wants this dealt with immediately.

295
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,200
Anything less he will take as a
personal repudiation of his presidency.

296
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,889
Okay, what's more important, the
president's feelings or capturing

297
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,400
the man who's responsible for
everything that's happened today?!

298
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,000
I hear what you're saying, Bill, but
Logan's already called the secret service.

299
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,300
They're on their way to
take Jack into custody.

300
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,300
I suggest you warn him immediately.

301
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,600
Before we move in, we need
confirmation Marwan's inside.

302
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll send in the remote camera,
see if we can get a visual.

303
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,200
What's your point of entry?

304
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,500
Ventilation shaft.

305
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,665
Chloe, it's Jack.

306
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,802
Can you get the schematics
for the AC configuration

307
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,500
for the building, send it over to my pda?

308
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,265
I'm on it, Jack.

309
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,900
I'll send it to you as soon as I can.

310
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,900
Okay

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,700
The camera's working.

312
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,100
O'Brian.

313
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,400
We've got a Los Angeles woman
reporting suspicious activities.

314
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,100
First Tier wants it kicked up to you.

315
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,700
Cross reference and I.D.Match?

316
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
She seems to be who she says she is.

317
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Okay, send her information to
my screen and put her through.

318
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,700
Here you go.

319
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,465
This is Chloe O'Brian, how can I help you?

320
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,300
I was just telling the man on the phone, I'm
not sure who exactly I should be talking to.

321
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,650
I'm an analyst at CTU Los Angeles.

322
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,100
Why don't you start at the beginning?

323
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm calling about my boyfriend.

324
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,600
What's his name?

325
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,000
You need to understand, I'm
not sure if this means anything.

326
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,400
You were about to tell me his name.

327
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,700
Sabir Ardakani.

328
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,500
We've been going out since grad school.

329
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,700
Can you spell that?

330
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,000
S-a-b-i-r A-r-d-a-k-a-n-i.

331
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Where'd you go to grad school?

332
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,000
Berkeley Tech.

333
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
We were both studying engineering.

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
He's been traveling a lot
lately, "business trips," he said.

335
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,389
I'm not sure why I looked, probably because
of everything that's been going on today,

336
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,900
but I found something on his computer.

337
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Tell me.

338
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,900
I think Sabir may have
become involved with...

339
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,800
radical groups.

340
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,500
You mean terrorists?

341
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,200
Yes.

342
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Where is Sabir now?

343
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,800
He said he was going to Arizona for a client
meeting, but the hotel has no record of him.

344
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
When you looked through his computer
files, tell me what you found specifically.

345
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,083
Most of his files are encrypted,
but there was one document

346
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:29,400
in the recycle bin that's a
schematic for a microchip-

347
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,000
A type I've never seen before.

348
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,200
Jack, do you copy?

349
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,300
Yeah.

350
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,600
Buchanan wants to talk to you.

351
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,100
Now?

352
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,300
He says it's urgent.

353
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,500
Fine.

354
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,600
Go ahead, Bill.

355
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Jack, we've got a problem.

356
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
Secret service is on their way
over there now to arrest you.

357
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,500
What are you talking about?

358
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,600
Logan knows we violated his
order when you after Prado.

359
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,800
Bill, they can't interrupt this mission.

360
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,165
You got to stall them.

361
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,700
Jack, I've been on the phone
for the last ten minutes.

362
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,200
There's nothing I can do from here.

363
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,300
You have to get Marwan before
secret service gets there.

364
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Curtis, did you copy that?

365
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah.

366
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,100
I'll run interference.

367
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Give me a couple minutes.

368
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
I'll be ready to transmit.

369
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,600
Yes, we're ready.

370
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,000
Excuse me, Marwan.

371
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,700
I just talked to Abat in New York.

372
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,800
As soon as you're done,
I'll upload the tape.

373
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,900
Good.

374
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,000
I want this delivered to television
stations by dawn on the east coast.

375
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,000
That won't be a problem.

376
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,300
Do you want to cover your face?

377
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,800
No.

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
I want the american people
to know who did this.

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,500
Ready.

380
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,000
People of america, you wake
up today to a different world.

381
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,500
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

382
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,700
It'll be days and weeks before you
can measure the damage we have caused.

383
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,500
But as you count your dead, remember
why this has happened to you.

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,667
You have no understanding
for the causes of the

385
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:16,500
people you strike down or
the nations you conquer.

386
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,100
You choose to meddle in
their affairs without respect.

387
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,700
You follow your government,
unquestioning, toward your own slaughter.

388
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Today you'll pay the
price for that ignorance.

389
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,400
I have camera in the vent.

390
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,500
I've got a visual on the main room.

391
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,165
Approximately 50 civilians.

392
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Marwan won't be here, he's going
to want to stay out of sight.

393
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Hold on, I've got a possible sentry...

394
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,100
and a second possible sentry at the
window, looking down on the street.

395
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Michelle, can you get a frame grab?

396
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
We're working on an I.D.

397
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,500
Sending a freeze frame to the
facial recognition software.

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,100
Jack, we have a match.

399
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,500
He's a known associate of Marwan.

400
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,200
That confirms that Prado
gave us a legitimate address.

401
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,900
But not that Marwan is in the building.

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,300
We can't risk exposing ourselves
till we know he's in there.

403
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,400
Castle.

404
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Secret service is approaching your position.

405
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,500
Jack, secret service has arrived.

406
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,700
Did Marwan's people see them approach?

407
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,265
No.

408
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
They came up through the rear alley.

409
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,400
Moving on to the next room.

410
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,700
Unless you renounce your policies of
imperialism and interventionist activities,

411
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,000
this attack will be followed by another,

412
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,100
and another after that..

413
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,700
I've got a visual on
people in the storage room.

414
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,600
How many?

415
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,700
Five.

416
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,400
But they're talking to
someone outside my sight line.

417
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,900
I got it.

418
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
All right, stand by, Jack.

419
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,100
What's going on?

420
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,765
Secret service.

421
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm Agent Greg Merfield,
this is Agent Frank Wells.

422
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,696
We know this is a highly
irregular situation, but

423
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,900
we have orders to take
Jack Bauer into custody.

424
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,000
Curtis, let me talk to them.

425
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,900
Go ahead, Jack.

426
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,800
This is Jack Bauer.

427
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,800
Right now we are trying to confirm
that Habib Marwan is in this building.

428
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,850
He is a terrorist in possession
of a stolen nuclear warhead.

429
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,600
I cannot impress upon you
how sensitive this mission is.

430
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,450
The president was specific, sir.

431
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,800
We need to pull you off this now.

432
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,500
I don't think you understand.

433
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:25,765
I am in a concealed position.

434
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,700
You pull me out now, you put
this whole operation in jeopardy.

435
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,800
As soon as this is over, I give
you my word I will go with you.

436
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry, agent, if you don't come out,
we're going to have to come in and get you.

437
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,900
Local secret service command
has confirmed the order, Jack.

438
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,000
There's nothing I can do about it here.

439
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,400
Jack, we don't have a choice.

440
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,000
We're going to need to replace you.

441
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,350
Jack, this is Castle.

442
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:46,400
I'm heading out to you.

443
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:46,965
Fine.

444
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Approach the south side of the building.

445
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,700
Got it.

446
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
Curtis, we're on the move.

447
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,700
All right, be careful.

448
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Marwan, the police are here.

449
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,500
Nasir saw an officer outside.

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,900
Start packing.

451
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,100
Hold on, I got a visual on Marwan.

452
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,750
I have a visual on Marwan.

453
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:33,900
He is in the building.

454
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,950
Damn it, they know we're here.

455
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:46,000
Everybody move on the building.

456
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:46,700
Our cover's blown!

457
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:47,265
Everyone, go!

458
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,000
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!...

459
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,765
Down!

460
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,600
Down!Down!Down!...

461
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:27,817
Everybody, get down!

462
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:29,000
Down! Down! Down!...

463
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,400
Freeze!

464
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,500
Hostile down.

465
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:58,200
I got him, Jack.

466
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,100
Marwan and his men have escaped through
a hole in the outer basement wall.

467
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,700
Set up a two-mile perimeter,
cover all utility access points.

468
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,400
Bomb!

469
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Bomb! Go!

470
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,800
Jack, what happened?

471
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Curtis!

472
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,000
Jack, do you read me?

473
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,200
Jack, you okay?

474
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:23,800
Yeah.

475
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,100
Check on the men.

476
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,400
Michelle, it's Jack.

477
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,200
We can't pursue, they blew
the tunnel up behind them.

478
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:34,500
It's completely blocked.

479
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,900
Have LAPD tighten up the perimeter.

480
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Get them to tell us what
this tunnel feeds into now.

481
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,600
Yeah.

482
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Jack...

483
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,000
Agent Bauer...

484
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,250
Agent Merfield.

485
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:48,965
Secret service.

486
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm sorry, but I'm here
to take you into custody

487
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,300
Hand over your weapon.

488
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
You blew this mission.

489
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,800
I'm sorry, sir, I'm just following orders.

490
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,748
has anyone asked President Logan

491
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,800
what the hell he was thinking, arresting
Jack in the middle of the operation?

492
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Look, Curtis, we still have
to focus on finding Marwan.

493
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,800
We pulled up city records.

494
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,300
The building is directly
adjacent to a sewer line.

495
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,400
How many street-level
egress points are there?

496
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,270
At least 30.

497
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:36,400
Which means Marwan's probably
gotten past our perimeters already.

498
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,900
Yeah, well, we still have to keep looking.

499
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,717
LAPD and FBI will set
down a grid down there.

500
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:41,500
I want you to coordinate your men with them.

501
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
We just found a videotape
on the man we shot.

502
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,800
It's been damaged, but we should be
able to recover most of what's on it.

503
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,400
Well, have one of your men come
back here with the videotape.

504
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,950
Edgar's repositioned the satellite.

505
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,200
We'll let you know if we find anything.

506
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,900
You got it.

507
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,200
How did Marwan get past your men?

508
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,100
They had to move in before they were ready.

509
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,400
Why?

510
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,349
Secret service showed up to take Bauer into

511
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,500
custody, which compromised
one of our positions.

512
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,000
I didn't mean...

513
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,300
that's not what i meant to have happen.

514
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
With respect, sir...

515
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,100
your orders were explicit.

516
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,000
What other search protocols are you running?

517
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,465
None, Mr. Novick.

518
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
We're essentially without a lead.

519
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,900
Bill, give us a few minutes.

520
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
We'll get right back to you.

521
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Standing by.

522
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,800
This is not my fault.

523
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
None of this would have
happened if Jack Bauer

524
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:56,700
hadn't disobeyed my
orders in the first place.

525
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Sorry, sir, but if you're asking me
to agree with that assessment, I can't.

526
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,100
If it wasn't for Jack,
we won't locate Marwan.

527
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,300
CTU is waiting for us to call
them back with a directive.

528
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,700
What would you like me to
tell them, Mr. President?

529
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,400
I have no idea.

530
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,200
And that's the problem, isn't it?

531
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,700
It is my fault we lost him.

532
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,700
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear
warhead, and I allowed him to escape.

533
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,500
Mr. President...

534
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:50,100
Stop.

535
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,200
I don't even know if I
deserve to be called that.

536
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,000
Whatever I call you won't change the fact-
you are president of the united states.

537
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I shouldn't be.

538
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,100
For the good of this
country, I should resign.

539
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:09,400
That's not an option, sir.

540
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,700
Not without destroying the public's
confidence, which is already at its limits.

541
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,000
Three presidents in as many
hours would be devastating.

542
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,600
Then what should I do, Mike?

543
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,400
Tell me what to do.

544
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,000
There's someone who can
advise you better than I can.

545
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,700
You should consider bringing him
in here to help you through this.

546
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,200
Who?

547
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,400
President Keeler is in
critical condition after Air

548
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:59,200
Force One crashed in the
Mojave desert a few hours ago.

549
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,328
A white house spokesperson
reports that the president was

550
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,400
taken to an undisclosed military
hospital following the crash.

551
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,500
Sir, there's a secure call
coming through for you.

552
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Thank you, Adam.

553
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,400
Hello.

554
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,100
Mr. President...

555
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,700
Mike?

556
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,800
Yes, sir.

557
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm sorry to disturb you so late.

558
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
I've been up all night following the news.

559
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
This is a tragic day for our country.

560
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,800
Yes.

561
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,600
May I ask when you received
your last intelligence briefing?

562
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Three hours ago, why?

563
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,100
Since then, the terrorist behind
today's events, Habib Marwan,

564
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,300
has taken possession of a nuclear warhead.

565
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,600
My god.

566
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,300
How?

567
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,400
Well, he recovered the football
from the wreckage of Air Force One,

568
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,900
and he used it to track
and steal the warhead.

569
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
President Logan feels he needs help.

570
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,700
What kind of help?

571
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,700
Substantial.

572
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

573
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,008
President Logan is requesting that you
run the effort to recover the stolen weapon

574
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:09,900
and be in place to make whatever
decisions need to be made.

575
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,100
A crisis is looming.

576
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,600
Hard choices may need to be made, and
by the president's own admission...

577
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,400
he feels he may not be up to the task.

578
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:31,200
This country is very possibly about to
face the worst terrorist act in its history.

579
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,100
We need your leadership.

580
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,100
Before I do anything,

581
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,500
I want to speak to
President Logan face-to-face.

582
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,700
Fair enough.

583
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,000
We'll notify your secret service
detail to bring you to the White House.

584
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,900
All right, Mike.

585
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,100
Thank you, Mr. President.

586
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,600
Please step out of the car, Agent Bauer.

587
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,800
What's going on?

588
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,600
President Logan realized this was a mistake.

589
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,700
You're free to go.

590
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,700
I am genuinely sorry about all this.

591
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,700
Doesn't really help us
with our situation, does it?

592
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
We had Marwan.

593
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,800
Any sign of him?

594
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,100
We have people all over the tunnels.

595
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,000
So far, nothing.

596
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,900
We had him.

597
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,500
Damn it!

598
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:46,065
We had him.

599
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,465
They're not finished searching the tunnels.

600
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,900
If you haven't found him
yet, you're not going to.

601
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:50,400
Too many ways in, too many ways out.

602
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
CTU have any new leads
on Marwan or the warhead?

603
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,200
No.

604
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,900
Great.

605
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,565
Load everybody up.

606
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
We're going back to CTU now.

607
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,500
All right, everyone, let's go.

608
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,600
Edgar...

609
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,765
I'm busy, Chloe.

610
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,900
I need you to release your system.

611
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,300
Why?

612
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
It's the only one with a random sequencer.

613
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
You're gonna have to wait.

614
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,965
I can't wait- someone called a lead in.

615
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,300
And now that Marwan's
escaped, I need to pursue this.

616
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,065
This is more important.

617
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,600
I have agents out there looking for Marwan.

618
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I need to reconfigure
the perimeter for them.

619
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,565
You don't need your system to do that.

620
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,900
Just tell them to use the profiles
we loaded onto their panels.

621
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,865
That won't be good enough.

622
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,100
Things are changing every minute.

623
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,800
They're field agents, they have guns.

624
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:28,100
They don't need you to coddle them.

625
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
You know, that's a pretty rude attitude.

626
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,400
I need your system.

627
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:32,900
No.

628
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,900
Tony.

629
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,400
What?

630
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,913
A woman called in, and she
thinks her boyfriend may

631
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,900
have had something to do with
today's terrorist attacks.

632
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,900
Did you verify it?

633
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,865
No, that's the problem.

634
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,300
I need to use Edgar's system.

635
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,600
Why?

636
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,700
Her evidence involves data that she
got from her boyfriend's computer.

637
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:51,900
It's in proprietary format.

638
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,700
Well, what's Edgar doing?

639
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,700
He's screwing around, moving agents
that Jack and Curtis don't need.

640
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,100
Edgar.

641
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,300
Yeah?

642
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,200
Let Chloe into your system.

643
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
What about tactical I'm running?

644
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:03,900
I still got guys out there.

645
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,965
Marwan's long gone.

646
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,400
Most of those agents you can call back in.

647
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,300
Excuse me.

648
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,300
Yes?

649
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,200
This is Morrison.

650
00:34:59,235 --> 00:34:59,865
Is there a problem?

651
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I haven't heard from you.

652
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
CTU found the club.

653
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,600
How'd they know you were there?

654
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,100
Must have been Prado.

655
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,600
Has the warhead been reconfigured?

656
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Yes.

657
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Then our timetable remains unchanged.

658
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,500
Marwan...

659
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,900
we, uh, may have a potential
security breach here.

660
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,300
Who?

661
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,900
The technician, Sabir.

662
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,500
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

663
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,400
But it's being taken care of?

664
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,600
Of course.

665
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,800
It's been handled.

666
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Let me know when it's done.

667
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,200
Tony.

668
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah?

669
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,000
The woman with the phone tip who was
suspicious about her boyfriend panned out.

670
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,100
What'd you find?

671
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,500
She sent us a schematic of a
microchip that we did analysis on.

672
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:54,300
It's used exclusively in
legacy nuclear warheads.

673
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,100
Does this include the
warhead Marwan has control of?

674
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes, this is the design of the chip that
controls the trigger on the stolen warhead.

675
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,500
What do we know about the man
whose computer we found this on?

676
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,200
His name is Sabir Ardakani.

677
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,800
According to his girlfriend,
he's recently become radicalized.

678
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,265
I want his picture and I.D.

679
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,500
On an all-agency distribution
list, highest priority.

680
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,600
She thinks he's out of state,
but she has no idea where.

681
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,367
Well, if he's in this
with Marwan, he's probably

682
00:36:16,368 --> 00:36:18,000
somewhere in the Iowa
region, with the warhead.

683
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,700
This woman who gave you
the tip, is she local?

684
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,165
Yes.

685
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,765
Los Feliz.

686
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,000
She says that the rest of the
files on his hard drive are locked.

687
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,600
If that's the case, we're
going to need a specialist.

688
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,881
We're going to need to send
a team over there as soon

689
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:28,500
as possible and see what
else we can dig up on him.

690
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,200
All right.

691
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,900
Chloe, I want you over there.

692
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,465
What?

693
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,800
Take a team with you, let's get on this.

694
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,500
Oh, I'm not a field agent.

695
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:36,300
I don't do that.

696
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,100
Chloe?

697
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,065
We need a specialist on this.

698
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,400
You're the only one who can get
those files off that hard drive.

699
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
I want to know what Ardakani's
doing and where he is.

700
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,600
Chloe...

701
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm giving you an order- go.

702
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Does my panel have a live
link to the tactical network?

703
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,400
Not yet.

704
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,800
What are you waiting for?

705
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,700
We don't do that until the agent's on site.

706
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,800
I'm not an agent.

707
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,800
I know that, but you're
attached to a mobile unit, Chloe.

708
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,300
I'm just trying to do things by the book.

709
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,700
Isn't always what you tell me to do?

710
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,050
Why do you have to be so contrary?

711
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:24,165
I'm just not comfortable out here.

712
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
I want to make sure you
have everything covered.

713
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,700
Fine, you have your live link.

714
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:29,300
What else?

715
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,500
Trunk my audio in with Bergen and White.

716
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,800
I want to make sure that I can
monitor two-way between them and CTU.

717
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,600
Done.

718
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,500
Okay, I can't think of
anything else right now,

719
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,065
but if I do, I'm going to call you,

720
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,600
and I really hope you don't give
me so much resistance next time.

721
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,700
Chloe, I know you're scared, and I'll make
sure everything is covered on this end.

722
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,800
Why did they ask me to do this?

723
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:51,600
I really hate it.

724
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,900
While you were prepping, I asked
Buchanan if I can go instead of you.

725
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,900
He wouldn't let me.

726
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,300
He said you were the best analyst we have.

727
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,800
He's right.

728
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,200
I know.

729
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
I'll call you if I can
think of anything else.

730
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,100
Okay.

731
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,100
Hi.

732
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm Agent O'Brian, these
are agents Bergen and White.

733
00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:43,300
You're Nabila Al-Jamil?

734
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes.

735
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,700
Where's the computer?

736
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:45,600
Please, come in.

737
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,900
These men need to search the house.

738
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,500
Did Mr. Ardakani keep records
other than on his computer?

739
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:55,000
There are some papers in the bedroom.

740
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
This is the computer you
found the chip schematic on?

741
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,721
Yes, but like I told your people on the
phone, the rest of his files are encrypted.

742
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:01,400
Are you sure?

743
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,900
Yes, I ran a check sum and
built a subroutine to confirm.

744
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,900
I have a doctorate in computer sciences.

745
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Okay, let's see...

746
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:10,965
You're right.

747
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,500
They used blowfish algorithm.

748
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,300
How can you tell?

749
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,200
By the tab on the file headers.

750
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Can you decrypt it?

751
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,100
CTU has a proprietary algorithm.

752
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:19,400
It shouldn't take that long.

753
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,600
We'll start by trying to hack the password.

754
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Let's start with the basics.

755
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,300
Write down nicknames, birthdays, pets-
anything you think he might have used.

756
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:26,900
Okay.

757
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,500
What was that?

758
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,000
I don't know

759
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:31,900
Go!

760
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,100
Go!

761
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,700
In here.

762
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,900
Your men are dead.

763
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:49,600
Open the door.

764
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,700
Don't you have a gun?

765
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,900
I work with computers.

766
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,900
Open the door.

767
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,965
Edgar Stiles.

768
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,750
Edgar, it's Chloe.

769
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:57,642
This is an emergency.

770
00:39:57,677 --> 00:39:58,500
We're being shot at!

771
00:39:58,535 --> 00:39:58,900
Where are you?

772
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,500
The Los Feliz location.

773
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:01,065
We need help!

774
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,800
Okay, all right...

775
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,400
Jack, Curtis, Chloe's in the field.

776
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:06,100
She's under fire.

777
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,965
What's her location?

778
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,700
1482 Franklin, Los Feliz.

779
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Curtis, how far out are
the closest tac teams?

780
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,300
I'm on it.

781
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,865
Chloe, it's Jack.

782
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,900
What's your situation.

783
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,600
I barricaded us in the laundry room.

784
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,700
Who are you with?

785
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,365
Our informant.

786
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Bergen and White were with me.

787
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,300
Bergen's down, I don't know where White is.

788
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,300
I'll call you back.

789
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,600
Chloe, don't hang up the phone.

790
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
Get her back on the line now.

791
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,000
Hurry.

792
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,565
This is Jack Bauer.

793
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,000
I need an LAPD response at 1482 Franklin.

794
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:44,400
We have two agents down, one under fire.

795
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Where are the tac teams?

796
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,200
About 15 minutes.

797
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,800
That's too long.

798
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,400
Be open, be open...

799
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,300
where are the keys?

800
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,300
where are the keys?

801
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,100
where are the keys?

802
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,100
Jack, it's her!

803
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,600
Put her on speaker.

804
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,100
Jack, how far away is help?

805
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,200
At least ten minutes.

806
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,600
Ten minutes is too long.

807
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,050
Chloe, just try to stay calm.

808
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:18,100
Tell me where you are now.

809
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,900
He's shooting at us!

810
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,965
The glass is bulletproof.

811
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,700
Chloe, I need you to tell me where you are.

812
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,200
We're in a CTU car.

813
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
He's shooting at us from outside.

814
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't have the keys. Can I hot-wire this?

815
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,565
No, it's secured.

816
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,300
But there should be weapons
stored inside the vehicle.

817
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
There's a rifle in the back.

818
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:35,865
It's locked.

819
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,200
I need the combination.

820
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm on it.

821
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,300
Chloe?

822
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,459
Where's going?

823
00:41:52,494 --> 00:41:53,900
Wait, I think he's leaving.

824
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
We got the combination?

825
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,200
Not yet.

826
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,000
He's going to ram us!

827
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,600
Oh, god!

828
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,800
What's taking so long, Jack?!

829
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:30,800
I've got it!

830
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,800
It's three-one-four-three!

831
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,000
Chloe, did you get that?!

832
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:34,869
Three-one...

833
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,300
What's going on here?

834
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,400
What's doing?!

835
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,490
Go, get out!

836
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:41,299
Get out, get out!

837
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:08,866
