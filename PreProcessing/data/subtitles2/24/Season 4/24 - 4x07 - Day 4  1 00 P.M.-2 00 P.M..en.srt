1
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,135
Put down the gun!

2
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,902
Put the gun down now!
Drop it, now! Step back!

3
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,202
I'll kill her!

4
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,701
<i>I will kill her!</i>

5
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>( yells )</i>

6
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:32,768
Jack, when I was inside,
I recognized

7
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:34,335
one of the men.
Who?

8
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,601
I can't place him,

9
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,401
but I know that I saw him
before today.

10
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:38,835
Why did they think
you were

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,702
holding something back
from them?

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,433
<i>I will not tell these people</i>

13
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,507
things about my private life
that they don't need to know.

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,102
<i>That you don't think
they need to know.</i>

15
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:49,601
What are you doing here?

16
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,668
Your mother told Madwan
you took care

17
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:52,935
of the American girl?

18
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:53,935
<i>Yeah?</i>

19
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,002
<i>Then you'll need help</i>

20
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,202
getting rid of the body.

21
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:58,601
He's going to kill our son.

22
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:00,302
Yes.

23
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,434
You brought me here
to kill me!

24
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:04,968
I took care of the girl!

25
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:06,102
Madwan knows!

26
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:08,568
It's not Madwan
that wants you dead!

27
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,202
Who wants me dead?

28
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:11,801
Your father.

29
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,801
Thank you so much
for helping me out.

30
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,235
<i>They said Maya's arrived?</i>

31
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:19,335
She's in the exam area.

32
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:20,635
I'm about to do
her work-up.

33
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,601
<i>ERIN:
She suffers from schizophrenia.</i>

34
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:25,302
I want us to be together again.

35
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,568
I'm sorry, Paul.

36
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:29,601
<i>I'm seeing someone.</i>

37
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,002
Paul, this
is Jack Bauer.

38
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,369
Nice to meet you.

39
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:36,202
What was your courier
transporting?

40
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,335
MAN: A Dobson-type override.

41
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,668
<i>What exactly does
this override do?</i>

42
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,269
It's a combination
of hardware and software

43
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:46,635
that can remotely take control
of a nuclear power facility.

44
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,568
And the person in possession
of this program,

45
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:50,035
could they do the opposite
with it?

46
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:51,768
Create a disaster at a plant,
a meltdown?

47
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:53,601
Theoretically, yes.

48
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:56,369
ERIN: How many nuclear
power plants in this country

49
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:57,434
would be vulnerable?

50
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,102
All of them.

51
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,235
<i>( phone rings )</i>

52
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,935
Yes?
It's me.

53
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,902
They found out
about the override.

54
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,468
Jack, did you get
the surveillance footage from

55
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,202
Hyatt Security? No, they
heard each dinner that

56
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,135
you attended was monitored
by a private company-

57
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:30,235
Felsted Security- I just
got off the phone with them.

58
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:32,369
They've got the videotapes
on file, but unfortunately,

59
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,801
they're working
off a closed system.

60
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,434
I've got to go there,
pick up the tapes,

61
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,002
bring them back here
for you to I.D.

62
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,369
Where are you on
the guest list?

63
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:40,534
I'm having it sent here.

64
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,269
You know,
we're running out of time.

65
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,635
What do you mean?
Is it that urgent?

66
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,135
Yes. As it turns out, your
kidnapping was just a cover

67
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,269
for a much larger attack.
The terrorists used

68
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,434
the broadcast of the trial
to overload the Internet,

69
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,235
and diverted all of
our attention away from

70
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:56,468
what they were
really trying to do.

71
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:57,501
I need a full tactical

72
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,902
for my vehicle.

73
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,601
Which is what?

74
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:03,501
They're in possession of a
stolen device called an override.

75
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:04,902
With that,
they've gained control

76
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,102
of the 104 nuclear power
plants across this country.

77
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,868
The override device maintains
heat levels within the reactors.

78
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,468
Effectively,
they can meltdown

79
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:12,868
every one
of those plants.

80
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:13,868
Oh, God... my God.

81
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:15,102
Thank you.

82
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:17,735
The man you saw when you
were being held captive,

83
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,002
right now,
he's our only lead.

84
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,501
Then let me come
to Felsted Security with you

85
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,668
and make the I.D. there. It'll
be quicker. Audrey, I can't.

86
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:25,302
After what you've
been through today,

87
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:26,801
I'm not going
to put you at risk.

88
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:28,968
You just said our nation's
nuclear power plants

89
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:31,302
will melt down if we don't
find that override, Jack.

90
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:34,568
We can't afford to
waste any more time.

91
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,568
Come over here.

92
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:43,568
There are 104 nuclear power
stations in the United States.

93
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:45,235
We just learned
that terrorists

94
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:48,235
are trying to convert all 104
nuclear cores into weapons.

95
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:50,935
Give us the worst-case casualty
scenarios, Curtis.

96
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:53,735
This graphic represents
a single meltdown scenario.

97
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,601
Edgar, break it
down for us.

98
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,202
If we can't wrest control
of the override,

99
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,902
it will shut down
the entire cooling system

100
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,135
and the core will melt through
the containment building.

101
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,434
In the first
three hours,

102
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,168
the population within
a ten-mile radius

103
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,302
will receive the highest
doses of radiation.

104
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,735
Most people will die
within two days.

105
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,235
Now, the smallest
of these 104 cities

106
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,168
represents
75,000 people.

107
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,468
Multiply that by 104,

108
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,035
we're looking
at three million casualties,

109
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:19,635
and that's conservative.

110
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:20,801
The environmental impact

111
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:22,701
would also be
catastrophic.

112
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:25,202
30 miles in all directions
of each plant

113
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,568
will be uninhabitable
for at least five years.

114
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,534
Don't these plants
have multiple security systems

115
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,801
to prevent
this kind of breech?

116
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,168
They do, but the override

117
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,801
has already deactivated them.

118
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,468
ERIN:
And if we don't succeed,

119
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:38,534
how long before these cores
start to melt down?

120
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,668
I'm projecting the first
radiation shock waves

121
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,068
in approximately three hours.

122
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:45,768
All right, I want everyone here
from Com and Logistics

123
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,168
to work on getting a handle

124
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:48,701
on the software.

125
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,235
The rest of you will handle
support in conjunction

126
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:52,668
with NRC personnel.

127
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,369
Let's get to work.

128
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:55,701
JACK:
Erin, we're leaving now.

129
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:57,235
Where you going, Jack?

130
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:59,668
Audrey's given us a significant
lead. We need to follow it up.

131
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,868
What kind of lead?
When we were being held,

132
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,902
I recognized someone
- he was an American. I saw him at

133
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,635
a function here in L.A.
a couple months ago.

134
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:07,635
We're going to view the
surveillance tapes of the function

135
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:09,369
at a private security
company not far from here.

136
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,468
I don't want her
going out now.

137
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:12,835
Why can't you access
the tapes here?

138
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,635
JACK: Sir, I wish we
could, but they're off line.

139
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,868
They would have to record
over four and a half hours

140
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:19,135
of material for us to view.
We don't have that time.

141
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,135
Jack told me that these
people are trying to use

142
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,701
our nuclear power plants as
weapons. We have to follow

143
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,302
this lead, and we have
to follow it now.

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,662
JACK: Sir, Audrey's the only person

145
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,263
who can make this I.D.

146
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,507
If anything happens, Jack,

147
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:32,401
I will hold you personally
responsible.

148
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:34,302
I understand.

149
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,002
How far away
is this facility?

150
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:41,468
Not far. Burbank.

151
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:43,135
Audrey...

152
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,568
Paul.

153
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,801
I'll get the team set up.

154
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:46,835
We need to talk.

155
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,068
We'll have to do it
when I get back.

156
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:49,068
Get back from where?

157
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:51,035
We're following up
on something.

158
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,801
Paul, please- can we
just do this later?

159
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:53,801
How many on your team?

160
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:54,835
Four of us.

161
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,168
Set up a weapons package.

162
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:58,269
I'll meet you in the motor pool. Done.

163
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:05,035
<i>( quietly ): ... cannot
see each other anymore.</i>

164
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,701
Look, I don't know
about all of this,

165
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,035
but I know about
you and him,

166
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,168
I am not okay
with that.

167
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,868
Look, you and I
aren't together anymore.

168
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,735
I thought we were trying
to work things out.

169
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,868
Yeah, I tried, but you
kept putting it off.

170
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,135
So I gave up.

171
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:17,868
We haven't been together
for over nine months.

172
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:19,668
We're not trying to work out
anything anymore.

173
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,401
Mr. Raines,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

174
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,801
She is my wife.
Paul, please.

175
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:28,568
Excuse me.

176
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,369
She's my wife.

177
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,968
Don't you forget that.

178
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:37,902
Yeah.

179
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,302
Let's go.

180
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,801
Jack, I'm sorry.

181
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,801
It's fine.

182
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:57,401
Hey, I just received
these files from DOD.

183
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:59,302
I need to give them
to Jack Bauer.

184
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,369
Oh, you can't.
Jack just left.

185
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,369
Oh, well, um, can I forward them
to him?

186
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:04,668
No, he went

187
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,068
with Audrey Raines
to Felsted Security

188
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,468
to look at some archive footage.

189
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,735
Okay... well, I guess I can just
hold on to them for him.

190
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:12,202
Yeah,
that'd be fine.

191
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:40,801
Paul.

192
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:41,935
Jim,

193
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,434
we need to talk.

194
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,035
Come in here.

195
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:57,635
Did you know about
Audrey and Jack Bauer?

196
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:59,401
Not till an hour ago.

197
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:00,902
Well, I've got to tell you,

198
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,468
they were carrying on
right under your nose.

199
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,668
It's pretty unprofessional,
wouldn't you say?

200
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:11,002
Look, I understand your feelings
about this,

201
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:12,135
but you and Audrey

202
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,434
have been separated
for almost a year.

203
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,401
Paul, I'm sorry,

204
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:17,568
but she's a big girl.

205
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:19,768
She can do what she wants.

206
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:23,002
Well, what she's
doing is she...

207
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,468
she's breaking my heart.

208
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,801
Maryanne...

209
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,935
Sarah.

210
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:51,302
What do you need back here?

211
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:53,935
Um... Edgar asked me to do
a manual reboot of Hub Five.

212
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,135
Oh, I can do that
for him.

213
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,068
No, no, it's fine.

214
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,035
Okay.

215
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:10,534
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

216
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,768
MAN:
Yes?

217
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,902
Bauer and Audrey Raines left
here about five minutes ago.

218
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:15,968
Where'd they go?

219
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:17,035
Felsted Security.

220
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:18,335
357 White Oak Boulevard.

221
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:19,701
It's in Burbank.

222
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,202
All right, good.

223
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,902
You're going to need to set
things up on your end.

224
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,235
What are you talking about?

225
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,868
I should be done here.

226
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:30,401
No. When Jack Bauer and
Audrey Raines are killed,

227
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,801
CTU is going to know that someone
inside leaked the location.

228
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:35,835
<i>( sighs )</i>

229
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,735
All right. What do I do?

230
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,068
Divert suspicion.

231
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:44,835
Fine.

232
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,568
I'm standing live in an area
just outside of the perimeter.

233
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,035
Unfortunately, the Pentagon
is not commenting at this time.

234
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:58,968
But what we do know
is that at 12:10 p. m.,

235
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,369
Secretary Heller
and his daughter, Audrey Raines,

236
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,235
were successfully rescued.

237
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,935
The number of fatalities
is unknown,

238
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,668
but sources say
there might have been

239
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:08,935
as many as 20 terrorists

240
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:10,735
inside the building at the time,

241
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,468
and it appears there
are no survivors among them.

242
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,401
It is also unclear as to...
Yes?

243
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,168
It looks like all the critical
instructions went with him,

244
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,768
before the assault.

245
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:20,868
Yes.

246
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,768
The override has taken control
of the nuclear power plants.

247
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:25,868
What about Behrooz?

248
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,002
What about our son?

249
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:33,801
We have to be strong now.

250
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,635
We'll mourn him
when this is over.

251
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,635
REPORTER: ... and as you might imagine,
among the most difficult of days

252
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,835
for Secretary Heller
and his daughter.

253
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,401
The Secret Service
was previously

254
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,168
swarming over this area
to secure it,

255
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:46,801
but have since taken
the Secretary

256
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,235
to an undisclosed location
for his safety.

257
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:50,335
<i>( phone rings )</i>

258
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,835
We hope to have
more information,

259
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,302
as officials are preparing
to make a public statement.

260
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:56,735
Hello?

261
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:57,902
Mom?

262
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,068
Behrooz?

263
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:01,235
Are you all right?

264
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:02,534
Tariq tried to kill me.

265
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,269
He was going to shoot me.

266
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,302
I had to defend myself.

267
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,401
What did you do?

268
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:07,701
I killed him.

269
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,534
You can't let Father know.

270
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,568
Why not?

271
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:11,902
Because Father is the one

272
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,202
who told Tariq to do it.

273
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,935
He wants me dead because
I messed up with Debbie.

274
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,601
Behrooz, that's not possible.

275
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,968
Your father would never want
to hurt you.

276
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,302
It's true.

277
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:23,668
Mom, I don't know what to do.

278
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,269
You have to help me.

279
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,534
Where are you now?

280
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,035
I'm near the Metrolink station

281
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:29,868
on Lassen in Chatsworth.

282
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,302
Are you using Tariq's car?

283
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,601
Yes.

284
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:35,701
Hide it. I'll pick you up there
in a half hour.

285
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,701
Hurry.

286
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,302
Who was on the phone?

287
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,468
It was nothing important.

288
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,668
Liar.

289
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:52,002
What did Behrooz do?

290
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:53,568
No, what did you do?

291
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,002
Did you give the order?

292
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:56,369
Behrooz was not committed.

293
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,668
It was just
a matter of time

294
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:58,968
before he turned
against us.

295
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:03,135
You ordered Tariq to kill him.

296
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,468
To kill our own son.

297
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,935
No, no, no, you...

298
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:13,801
Where is Tariq?

299
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,202
Behrooz killed him.

300
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,369
That's impossible.

301
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,102
Because you think he's weak?

302
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,434
He's not.

303
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:22,601
<i>Nothing... nothing
will stand in the way</i>

304
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,735
of what needs to be done.

305
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,269
Not him,

306
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:28,235
not you.

307
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:30,302
Where is he now?

308
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:31,335
Why?

309
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,902
What are you going to do?

310
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,735
You're hurting me.

311
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:39,202
I will do more than that.

312
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,835
Now you listen to me, woman.

313
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:43,534
You will do exactly
as you told him.

314
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:47,235
You will pick him up
in a half an hour.

315
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,956
What did you say to Paul?

316
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:35,090
That I'm filing for divorce
as soon as I get back to D.C.

317
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:38,756
Are you sure
that's what you want?

318
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,389
Yes.

319
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,890
Okay.

320
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:04,756
Yes!

321
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,190
Do you have something?

322
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,956
It looks like the Dobson
override device

323
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,489
hasn't completely taken control
of all the reactors.

324
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,589
I'm starting to get some
response. What could I do?

325
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,789
Nothing. Just stay off Hub Five.
I need it.

326
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,123
I thought Hub Five
was out for a reboot.

327
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,456
No.

328
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:22,056
Curtis! Come here!

329
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:25,123
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

330
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,990
Actually, I'm kind of busy.

331
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,123
You lied to me about
doing a reboot for Edgar.

332
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:32,522
Yes, I did.

333
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:33,556
Why?

334
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,756
Sarah, I had
a personal call to make,

335
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,522
and I knew it would be
inappropriate

336
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:39,789
at the time of the crisis.

337
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:41,290
I didn't want anyone to know.

338
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:42,823
Then why'd you do it in here?

339
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,422
Why didn't you just go outside?

340
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:50,357
I was trying to make it look
like I was working, okay?

341
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,489
Look, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

342
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:05,556
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

343
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,489
It's Madwan.

344
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,923
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

345
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,689
Yes.

346
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,956
Has Tariq taken care
of your son?

347
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:21,056
I haven't spoken to Tariq yet,
but I'm sure

348
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,123
if there was a problem,
he would've called me.

349
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,456
The fact that I'm even talking
to you about this is a problem.

350
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:27,823
The next two hours are crucial.

351
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,190
I can't be distracted by this.

352
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,323
I understand.

353
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,823
I promise,

354
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,656
I will personally
oversee the situation

355
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,123
and make sure
it is resolved.

356
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,257
Fix this, Navi.

357
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,223
Of course.

358
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:46,422
What is Madwan going to say

359
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,823
if he finds out Behrooz
killed Tariq?

360
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,456
Tariq is expendable,
like we all are.

361
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,723
Madwan understands that.

362
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,689
All he cares about
is that Behrooz is silenced.

363
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:04,123
I will not be able to look
at you after today

364
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,990
without thinking about
what we did to him.

365
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,456
I think I got it.

366
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,023
What?
The Dobson override.

367
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,023
I think I've got
a piece of the code.

368
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,323
What does that mean?

369
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,323
If this is really it,
I can turn off the override,

370
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,156
and stop the remaining plants
from melting down.

371
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:35,422
What do you need?

372
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,389
To get into the software kernel,
but the NRC

373
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,056
will never let me.
It's too dangerous. Why?

374
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,489
If I tinker in there
and screw up,

375
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:42,056
I can start a chain reaction.

376
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,456
All right, Edgar.

377
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,090
I'm going to need you
to present this to Heller.

378
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:46,422
He can order NRC
to let you in.

379
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:47,589
Present to Heller?

380
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:48,823
Yeah, he's in
the situation room.

381
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,456
I shouldn't do this, Curtis.

382
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:51,756
Why not?
I could faint.

383
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:53,623
I feel very nauseous.
I have low blood sugar.

384
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,056
It's just Driscoll
and Heller.

385
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:56,290
Driscoll's in there, too?

386
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,623
Excuse me,
Mr. Secretary.

387
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,190
I'm going to have
to interrupt you.

388
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,689
What is it? This is Edgar
Stiles, our chief analyst.

389
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,856
He's requesting access
to the kernels

390
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,257
of the power plants.

391
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:11,456
My understanding is that

392
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,323
no one is to manipulate
those kernels

393
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:14,956
while the plants are on line.

394
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:19,522
Yes, but there is a way to do it
if you're careful.

395
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,756
I'd have to stay away from
the pre-compiled headers,

396
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,190
while I was putting
the software lock

397
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:24,422
on the Dobson override code.

398
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,257
But the chances of causing
a load imbalance...

399
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:28,389
I don't understand one
thing you're talking about.

400
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:31,023
Just tell me
what the downside is

401
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,823
if the kernels
are disrupted

402
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,223
because of your
manipulation.

403
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,589
<i>( sighs )</i>

404
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,422
If I make a mistake,
I can accelerate

405
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,489
a core meltdown
in some of the reactors.

406
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:45,789
This is probably a bad idea.
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

407
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,257
But if you're
successful,

408
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,456
you can regain control
of the reactors?

409
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,689
Yes.

410
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:52,389
Edgar, what we need to know
is can you do this

411
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:53,990
without making a mistake?

412
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:01,290
Yeah, I can do it.

413
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:03,890
You're not filling me
with confidence, Edgar.

414
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,556
Look...

415
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:08,589
I'm just a little nervous.

416
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:11,890
But if I say I can do it,
I can do it.

417
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:18,589
He'll run away
the moment he sees you.

418
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:19,689
He won't see me.

419
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,990
You'll be the only one
in the car

420
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,589
when you pick him up.

Yes.

What did you tell Dad?

429
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,123
I didn't; I just left.

430
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,123
He was busy working.

431
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,223
What are we going to do?

432
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,257
Wherever we go, he'll find us.

433
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:49,223
No, he won't.
I know a safe place.

434

I didn't understand, until
today, what it would feel like.

Doing these things-
they're wrong, Mom.

436
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,123
And I see it now.

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,990
Don't think about that anymore.

You'll be safe now.

439
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,923
But I am thinking about it.

440
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,923
Maybe I should go to the police
and tell them everything I know.

441
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,190
We'll talk about it
when I get there.

442
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,823
Okay.

443
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,522
You did well.

444
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:02,584
Who are they?

445
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,152
Don't worry about it.

446
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:07,385
Just make sure you take the
second exit at Angeles Crest.

447
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,118
He's going to ask me
why I'm stopping.

448
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,918
Let him ask.

449
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:12,052
What do I tell him?

450
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,785
Don't tell him anything.

451
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,551
We'll meet you there.

452
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,519
Erin? We're making
good progress.

453
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,718
Tell me. We've been able to take

454
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:52,551
87 power plants off line,
they're safe.

455
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,318
What about the other 17? The
terrorists were able to use the override

456
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,551
to block a shutdown.

457
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:58,252
Everything we're trying
is being repelled.

458
00:20:58,318 --> 00:20:59,985
What are we doing
to get around it?

459
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,918
Believe me, Erin,
we're trying everything.

460
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:03,519
If there's a way,
we'll find it.

00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:28,385
Nothing.

489
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:30,918
You tortured my son
for almost three hours

490
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:33,018
and ended up yielding nothing?

491
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,519
You gave the order, sir.

492
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:47,885
Give us a moment, please.

493
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:56,018
I'm sorry this had
to happen, Richard,

494
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:57,285
but we had to make sure

495
00:22:57,352 --> 00:22:59,818
that you weren't withholding
anything from us.

496
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:02,252
I hate you.

497
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,684
I never want to see you again.

498
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:11,352
Please understand
that I am responsible

499
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,218
for the lives
of millions of people.

500
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,751
You torture me and now
you want me to forgive you?

501
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:24,718
This just confirms everything
I always knew about you.

502
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,551
Am I free to leave?

503
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,352
Yes.

504
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:49,885
<i>( phone rings )</i>

505
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,218
Yeah, Paul.

506
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:59,818
Audrey, do you have a minute?

507
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:01,785
Sure, what's going on?

508
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:04,018
I just talked to your dad,
and he said something to me

509
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,651
that I've been
thinking about it a lot.

510
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:07,052
He said that you're a big girl,

511
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:09,085
and I think I've been treating
you like a child.

512
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:10,684
I don't think that, Paul.

513
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:13,452
Well, whether it comes off
that way or not,

514
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,885
I need to respect your choices,
respect who you are

515
00:24:16,951 --> 00:24:18,684
<i>and... ( sighs )</i>

516
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:21,218
I've been so stupid
about all of this.

517
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:24,684
I've lost sight of the
things I love about you.

518
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,651
Look, uh...

519
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,252
I hear what you're
saying, but I don't...

520
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,684
I don't really know
how to respond to that.

521
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:34,951
Well, you don't have to.

522
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,452
I just want you to know that

523
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,651
I've been wrong about
a lot of things

524
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:40,985
and before you make
any big decisions,

525
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:43,385
decisions that you're entitled
to make,

526
00:24:43,452 --> 00:24:46,052
let some time go by.

527
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,218
Is that fair?

528
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,485
Is that fair of me to ask?

529
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,385
Yeah. Yeah,
that's fair.

530
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,419
Okay, well, I'll, uh...

531
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,584
I'll see you later.

532
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:58,218
Yeah. See you later.

533
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,052
How far out are we?

534
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:08,218
A few miles
away, sir.

535
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:09,918
Okay.

536
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:39,085
Where are we going to go?

537
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:40,519
Out of the city.

538
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:41,851
Why did Father

539
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,318
want to kill me?
I'm his son.

540
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,918
Stop, Behrooz, you can't

541
00:25:44,985 --> 00:25:46,152
think about that now.
Get in.

542
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,385
Get in.

543
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:55,252
Mom, we killed
two people today.

544
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:58,185
I can't do this.
I'm freaking out.

545
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,918
Shh.

546
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:04,519
Get on the train.

547
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:07,285
What?

548
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:08,985
Your father's
following us.

549
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:10,218
What?!

550
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:12,018
It was the only way
I could save you.

551
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,018
Now, damn it,

552
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:14,651
Behrooz, get out, go.

553
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:18,751
Go!

554
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:19,918
Obey me!

555
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:21,185
Oh, God!
Mom!

556
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:22,551
Mom!
Oh, God!

557
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:30,618
Go!

558
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:34,018
<i>( screaming )</i>

559
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:39,519
<i>( groaning )</i>

560
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:50,851
Watch out!

561
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:52,218
<i>( tires squealing )</i>

562
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,038
Is it taken care of?

563
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,838
No, there's a problem.

564
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:59,771
My wife and Behrooz
have betrayed us.

565
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,339
Where are they now?

566
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,504
I don't know.

567
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,938
But Dina's been wounded.

568
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:21,105
She'll have to get
medical attention.

569
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:25,371
So you've come to me asking me
for help with this mess?

570
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,072
I can't do it alone, Madwan.

571
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:32,272
I'm ashamed of myself.

572
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,671
Allow me to make this right.

573
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:36,671
What would you need?

574
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:39,371
To monitor
local hospitals.

575
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:41,805
I'll also need drivers,

576
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,605
as well as access

577
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:44,805
to police frequencies.

578
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:46,738
You think she'll go
to the police?

579
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:47,905
No, no.

580
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:50,205
But they may pick her up
if they find out

581
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,771
she's been shot.

582
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,938
I told you...

583
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:05,272
I can't be distracted
by this right now.

584
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:09,638
Give him what he needs.

585
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:12,805
Make sure the woman and child
are captured

586
00:29:12,872 --> 00:29:15,038
before they can
do us harm.

587
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:17,805
Thank you.
Thank you, Madwan.

588
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:22,438
No matter what happens today,

589
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:25,205
you will answer for this.

590
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:29,605
I understand.

591
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:46,371
No, we just got here.

592
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:49,538
How long is it going to take you
to create the database?

593
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:52,705
Okay.

594
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:56,905
Okay, Marcie, thanks.

595
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:58,504
Our office just got
a copy of the guest list

596
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:00,305
from the dinner where
you saw this guy.

597
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:02,705
Once you make an I.D. on the
surveillance tape, we'll be able

598
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:05,239
to send it through a database,
and we'll find out who it is.

599
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,504
Okay.
I'm carrying.

600
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,005
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

601
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,404
Yeah.

602
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:11,504
Jack, this is Maryanne Taylor
at CTU.

603
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,571
What is it, Maryanne?
Curtis wanted me to tell you

604
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:15,371
that as soon as Audrey
recognizes somebody

605
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,638
from the surveillance video,

606
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,272
he wants it sent directly
to my system.

607
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:19,272
I'm on 60 Casper.

608
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,771
Why didn't he
tell me himself?

609
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:22,438
They're still trying
to shut down

610
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,038
all the remaining power plants,

611
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,404
and everybody else is still
working on that.

612
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,404
Are they going to be able
to control them in time?

613
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:29,805
I don't know.

614
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:31,404
Okay, keep me informed.

615
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:32,905
What is it?

616
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:35,638
We don't have
a lot of time.

617
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:38,738
She seems to be doing
better now. She's sleeping.

618
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,438
Oh, that's
very good news.

619
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,305
Did you give her Haldol?

620
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,438
Mm-hmm. Why?

621
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:52,172
She's allergic to it.
It's in her file!

622
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:55,038
The date on this is gone.
This is the wrong file.

623
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,272
Maya! Maya!

624
00:30:57,872 --> 00:30:59,239
Maya? She's unconscious!

625
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,538
Mary, we have a code!

626
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,705
I need 25 cc's
of norepinephrine.

627
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:06,072
How could you have
gotten the wrong file?

628
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:10,805
I need that syringe now.

629
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:16,272
Ms. Driscoll,

630
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:18,105
Secretary Hel...

631
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:22,438
What is it, Sarah?

632
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:24,671
Sarah!

633
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:27,404
Secretary Heller needs you.

634
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:28,605
For what? He's going online

635
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:29,671
with the President

636
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:32,205
in a few minutes
and he wants to know

637
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:34,504
about our progress
on the reactors.

638
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,072
Um, tell him that

639
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:38,571
they're still trying to get
control of the system kernel

640
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:41,705
and that we'll know more
in 15 minutes.

641
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,404
If we do stop
the meltdown,

642
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:44,771
he wants to know

643
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:46,438
if there's going to be
any system contamination.

644
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,838
Uh, no, there won't
be any contamination.

645
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:51,172
It'll take 36 hours
to reboot the reactors.

646
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,471
Is there anything else?

647
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,005
No, that's all.

648
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:55,538
All right, go.

649
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,172
We had security cameras running
on only two areas of the event.

650
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,938
One was covering
the main ballroom

651
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,905
and one was
at the entrance.

652
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,705
Okay, put them both up.

653
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,838
The ballroom angle is too wide.

654
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,504
Let's just go
with the entrance.

655
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:24,738
What time is that?

656
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:26,404
6:39.

657
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:27,471
No, that's too early.

658
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:28,738
I met him when
I arrived,

659
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:30,471
around 9:00, 9:15.

660
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:33,239
<i>( keys clicking )</i>

661
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:45,638
Wait, stop.

662
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,105
Can you back this up
a few frames?

663
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:51,172
Sure.

664
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:58,371
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop there.

665
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:01,305
I think that's him.

666
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:05,671
Can you enhance him right here? Yeah.

667
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,538
That image
won't process.

668
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:10,138
We need to make it clearer.

669
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,838
Okay, let me see
if I can get that for you.

670
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:21,005
Who's supposed
to be at that desk?

671
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:23,172
Oh, that's Mitchell.

672
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,671
Probably went out

673
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,571
for another smoke.

674
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,638
JACK:
The back gate's wide open.

675
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:29,638
No one's there.

676
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:30,638
Greg, do you copy?

677
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:32,339
Greg?

678
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,938
Rick?

679
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,239
How many ways into this
area of the building?

680
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:39,205
Two.

681
00:33:39,272 --> 00:33:40,972
Put them up. Rick!

682
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,038
Get down. Get down!

683
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:50,138

Yeah!( tech grunts )</i>

Damn it!

686
00:33:57,272 --> 00:33:59,705
I'm going to look for help,
okay? But first I need to know

687
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,738
about the surveillance tape
Where's the source?

688
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:06,872
The main...
ser... server...

689
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:08,972
How do I access it?

690
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:11,872
Put it on the...
the... flash memory.

691
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:13,371
Okay.

692
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:15,205
Watch the security monitors.

693
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:20,638
Do you have sticks?

694
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:22,538
<i>( gasping )</i>

695
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,138
Gary, do you have sticks?

696
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:28,172
In my... in my... pocket.

697
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:32,538
Okay.

698
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,305
Stay with me.

699
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:46,339
He's gone.

700
00:34:46,404 --> 00:34:49,504
Jack, they're coming.

701
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:51,605
JACK:
They're trying to seal us off.

702
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:52,838
Shouldn't we call CTU?

703
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:54,404
No, CTU's got to be compromised.

704
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,438
That's the only way

705
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,771
they'd know we were here.

706
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,038
We've got to get out of here.

707
00:34:59,705 --> 00:35:00,638
Move. Go, go!

708
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:17,038
Go.

709
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:29,838
Go, go.

710
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:48,239
There's one in the pipe.

711
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:50,072
The safety's off.
Jack...

712
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:52,038
You can do this.
We'll cover each other.

713
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,172
I thought you said
CTU's been compromised.

714
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,072
It has been.

715
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,205
Then who are you calling?

716
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:07,571
The only person I can trust right now.

717
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:24,974
If there are 17 nuclear power
plants about to melt down,

718
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,840
I need to update
an evacuation strategy.

719
00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:29,041
I agree, sir.

720
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,540
I've already laid
the groundwork

721
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:32,106
with the National Guard.

722
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:35,407
They're preparing to go into
individual communities

723
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:39,041
and effect a civil defense
evacuation upon your command.

724
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:41,041
You say our worst-case scenario
gives us

725
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,373
approximately three hours.

726
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,041
That's correct, sir.

727
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:48,307
Erin, what are our chances of
shutting down the remaining 17?

728
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,540
At this time, I would say
it's less than 50%,

729
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,140
but we're trying something now

730
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:53,840
that might improve
those chances.

731
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:56,041
When will you know more?

732
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:57,907
In the next 15 minutes.

733
00:36:57,974 --> 00:36:58,874
Keep me updated.

734
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:00,073
Yes, Mr. President.

735
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,473
Let's find out
from Jack and Audrey

736
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,674
if they've come up

737
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,407
with anything on their end. Yes, sir.

738
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:15,106
Mr. Secretary, I can have a room
prepared for you to rest, if you like.

739
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,407
You've been under a great deal
of strain these past few hours.

740
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:22,273
No, I don't think I can rest,
but thanks, anyway.

741
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,140
Erin?

742
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:26,840
Yes, sir?

743
00:37:26,907 --> 00:37:30,774
I understand your daughter
is down in the clinic.

744
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,140
Yes, but it won't interfere
with my work.

745
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:35,340
I'm sure it won't.

746
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:39,173
I was just wondering
if everything was okay.

747
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:44,407
It's something we've lived with
since she was six years old.

748
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:47,507
There are good days
and bad days.

749
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:48,574
Today's a bad one.

750
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,307
I'm sorry.

751
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,240
<i>( whispering ):

00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:19,273
Come here.

754
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:01,106
Okay, we're going
to get through this.

755
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,307
You've got to listen to me.

756
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,807
I need to get that
guy's weapon. Mm-hmm.

757
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,106
I need you
to provide cover.

758
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:06,840
Save your ammunition.
Space out your shots.

759
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:07,840
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

760
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:09,106
Okay.

761
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:24,974
Damn it.

762
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,240
Audrey, get down!
I'm out!

763
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,907
Go!

764
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:35,440
I'm empty.
What?

Yeah! We're all right!

Edgar's just started
the final sequence.

772
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,373
Is he in the kernel yet?

773
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,340
Yes. This is where he
can't make a mistake.

774
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:25,206
If he does, he'll
accelerate the meltdowns

775
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,407
instead of
stopping them.

776
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,340
Sarah, look up
the out codes

777
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:32,740
for Load "A" registered condition.

778
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:36,407
"FF-09."

779
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:38,173
No, that's a jump "A",
I need a load "A."

780
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,307
Damn it, move.

781
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,707
That's it, "AB-A1."
I think I got it.

782
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:47,273
What do you mean, you
think? I'd like to go

783
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,840
through it again
before I send it, please.

784
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,907
How long will that take?

785
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:53,173
Ten minutes. We don't have
time. You have to do it now.

786
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,674
Let me just check the headers.

787
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,041

Oh, no, don't tell me that.

ERIN:
Edgar, what's going on?

797
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:33,206
Why are some of the reactors
still not shutting down?

798
00:42:33,273 --> 00:42:34,307
Edgar?

799
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:39,340
Edgar, talk to me.

800
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:44,206
Six of the reactors are immune
to the kill sequence.

801
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:47,340
The Dobson override's already
taken over their system.

802
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:49,206
Those six are going
to melt down?

803
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:51,373
The shutdown codes have been
completely corrupted.

804
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,473
Contact Bauer.

805
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,507
Either he finds
the people responsible

806
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,674
for planning
the override,

807
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,807
or we're looking
at a nuclear holocaust.
