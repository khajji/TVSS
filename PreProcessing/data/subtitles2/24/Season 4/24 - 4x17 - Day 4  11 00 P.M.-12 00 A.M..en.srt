1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,400
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,400
We have a problem. If the information on that hard drive is discovered by the Americans,

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,700
it'll jeopardize the next phase of our plan.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,200
Well, it's not here.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,300
Keep looking.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,200
Agent Drake?
Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon now!

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,500
Jack's on the line.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,600
Jack, what is it?

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
I pulled some data off a hard drive that we found hidden in Anderson's apartment.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,200
I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a stealth fighter.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,100
Mr. President, we have reason to believe that a stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,800
- He's in your airspace as we speak.
- Just how sure are we about this?

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
It's a near-certainty, Mr. President.
This is a stealth aircraft.

14
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:54,500
If he finds you,
he may be on you before your fighter escort can react.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,100
Mitch Anderson, we know who you are.
We know what you're trying to do.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,700
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson? Chloe, I think we've been cut off.
Is there an override channel?

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,400
He's cut off all communication circuits.
I don't think there's anything we can do.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,100
Dad. I'm scared.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,300
Air Force One has been fired on.
I repeat, Air Force One has been fired on.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,400
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Was Air Force One just hit?
Was Air Force One just hit?!

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Escort pilots report Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit by an air-to-air missile. Pieces are falling to the ground over the desert.

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,800
The following takes place between 11:00 P.M. and 12:00 A.M.

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,800
This is Air Force One. We are declaring an emergency. Repeat, Air Force One is declaring an emergency.

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Copy, Air Force One. What is your condition? Over.

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:09,000
Extensive damage to the port side wing and fuse lines. We've lost our pressurization, losing fuel pressure. Low hydraulics.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
Chloe, are those the coordinates?

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Yeah. They're 20 knot of the miles northeast to the city of Indio.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Edgar. Contact local PD and EMS. Alert them of the situation with Air Force One.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,900
On it.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,000
Tony, do we have any CTU support teams in the area?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,600
The Las Vegas office has two satellites search and rescue teams available.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,700
I'm gonna dispatch Air Force One's coordinates to all of the search and rescue teams over in LA and Vegas so they can start for the landing site now.

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,700
Edgar, pull up satellite on the National Park. Pinpoint any possible landing scenarios.

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Chloe, what's happening?

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,400
We've lost the signal. They're still moving fast and losing altitude.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,100
Change the frequency.

38
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,400
OK, I've got it.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Reaching 6 knots.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Going through 7500 and 210 knots.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,300
Roger, 210 knots.

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,800
Chloe, are you still waiting coordinates?

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
Yeah, they're making a turn.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Roger, I'm close to a stall. Yeah, I'm putting you down now. Don't get redeployed, we are still hard and fast.

45
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Air Traffic Control, This is CTU. We are sending EMS, Police and rescue teams to the site ASAP.

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,000
Copy that, CTU.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,500
This is Air Force One, descending through 5500, 169¡­

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Chloe, what's showing on radar?

49
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,000
Air Force One is down.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,400
Air Force One? Air Force One, do you read? Air Force One is down.

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,200
I just got a confirm of scattered ground flashes from DOD satellite.

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Edgar, bring that up.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
What's the status of Air Force One?

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's down.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,100
What's its crash signature like?

56
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,700
It was a rough landing, radio's down. We don't know if there are any survivors.

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,900
Match your coordinates to the satellite. Send it to all agencies.

58
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,700
Got it.

59
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,200
Anybody tried sub-channel com-sat?

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
No.

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Secret Service has at least five personnel on board; all of them have private channels.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Com-sat 3 operator.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,100
This is Jack Bauer. Log in password: F-H-Ralfie-4.

64
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Go ahead.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
I want you to flood all AF1 channels with an acknowledge signal.

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:35,500
Copy. This is com-sat 3 operator, calling AF1 channels 1 through 5, please acknowledge. AF1 channels 1 through 5, please acknowledge.

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
This is channel 3.

68
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,400
Who's this?

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Peterson. We're down.

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
What is the status of the President?

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
I don't know. I can't move yet.

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Agent Peterson, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm with CTU. Rescue units are on route. What else can you tell me?

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,900
I see some bodies. I¡­ I think we have some survivors.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,700
Mr. Vice President, I just received confirmation.

75
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,900
Air Force One sustained an indirect hit from an air-to-air missile fired from a stolen stealth fighter.

76
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,300
Is the President alive?

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,300
We don't know at this time.

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,800
When will we know?

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
Hopefully within the next few minutes.

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:33,300
Charles, we've known each other for 15 years. If I can offer some advice?

81
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,500
Of course.

82
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,300
We all hope President Keeler is alive, but even if he is,

83
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,300
it's very likely he won't be in any shape to run the country.

84
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,500
You need to make arrangements to be sworn into office as soon as possible,

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,100
and the media should provide live coverage.

86
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,000
The American people need to be reassured that their leadership is intact.

87
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,900
It's good advice, Mike. I'll take it under consideration, but I don't wanna act prematurely.

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,800
I understand.

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,700
Well, we have to get to the White House. I've arranged for a security briefing with the Pentagon.

90
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,200
That's great.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,300
By now, you all know that Air Force One has been shot down. The escort pilots following Air Force One managed to get a visual of the stealth fighter used to commit the act,

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:47,400
pilot engaged, then shot down the stealth. The status of the President is unclear at this time. Rescue teams are minutes away. We'll know very soon.

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,300
The man responsible for what has transpired today, Habib Marwan, is still out there,

94
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,900
and most likely planning further attacks. I want every one of you to rededicate yourselves to finding Marwan.

95
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't want a single lead ignored or a shred of evidence missed.

96
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,900
Let's get back to work.

97
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
Michelle, let me talk to you.

98
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,000
I want you to uplink all curtainlies to a station, so you and I can start working on a priority list.

99
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,900
We might not know exactly where Marwan is, but he has to be within a 15 mile radius¡­

100
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,400
J ack.

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Jack. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just got off the phone with the Secretary of Defense, and right now there's a higher priority than finding Marwan.

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,400
What is it?

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,700
Recovering the Nuclear Football.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Didn't it go down with Air Force One?

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,900
Not exactly. The missile inflicted enough damage that the plane left a trail of debris as it went down.

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,100
A lot of things were sucked out, including the Football. There's a transponder embedded in the casing, so we know its exact location.

107
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, good, then the retrieval team should have no problem recovering it.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
The Secretary wants you to head up that team, Jack.

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Why?

110
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
It's his top priority.

111
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,200
That case contains the codes and locations of out entire nuclear arsenal.

112
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,500
Nothing is more critical than getting it back, and as quickly as possible.

113
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,200
Fine.

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll organize your team, mobilize the units.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,900
Thanks.

116
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
What's the location of the Football?

117
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,800
Forty miles northeast of here, in the middle of the desert.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Hey. Hey.

119
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong?
What else is happening?

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Paul may have to go back into surgery. Apparently the bullet did more damage than they thought.

121
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,600
I keep thinking if I had handled things differently, if I had trusted him more, that¡­

123
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,100
Audrey, you are not responsible for this.

124
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,000
I, and I alone, made the decision on how to handle Paul.
If you wanna remain affective,

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,700
be able to do your job, you have to let it go.

126
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,300
Jack, that's your gift.
You're able to block things out. I can't do that.

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,900
Jack, the chopper's waiting.

128
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,200
I have to change and get ready.

129
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,600
All right.

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Honey.

131
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,600
What's wrong?

132
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,800
I don't know. Something woke me up. It sounded like some kind of an explosion or something.

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Explosion? Nearby?

134
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm not sure.

135
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,100
It was probably just a bad dream.

136
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
Yeah.

137
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:49,600
You're still stressed, aren't you? I want you to try and forget about work, OK?

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Just focus on what we came out here for ¨C to relax,

139
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,900
and to make a baby.

140
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,700
Look.

141
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
What?

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,300
Watch your step.

143
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, my God.

144
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,200
Kelly.

145
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
What is it?

146
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,000
If the President is unable to fulfill his duties, Vice President Logan will have to assume office, at least on temporary basis.

147
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,200
Cabinet members will need to be briefed on the circumstances surrounding the crash.

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
Not all Cabinet members are equal. State and Defense need more detail than say, Aviculture and Treasury.

150
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,900
Yeah, I can handle it.

151
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,300
I just wanna make sure that the transition is smooth.

152
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,900
I understand,
but uh¡­ I do know what to do.

153
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,500
All right.

154
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Tony.

155
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,100
I've noticed a little hostility on your part. If it's because of me and Michelle¡­

156
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,200
It's none of my business.

157
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,600
As far as the hostility goes, I can promise you ¨C it's over with.

158
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Whatever you say.

159
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,500
One more thing; I think the world of Michelle, love working with her.

160
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Outside work, we never got off the ground,

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,600
she never said why but it didn't take a genius to figure it out ¨C she cared about you.

162
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,100
If you ask me, she still does.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Mr. Buchanan, rescue teams are inside Air Force One.

164
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
We're picking up the live feed now.

165
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:50,600
Go ahead. Check to see if he's alive.

166
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,700
She's dead too.

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Copy that. They said he was in the conference room.

168
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,969
We got a survivor.

169
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,443
I'm going in.

170
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Looks like the President's son. He's dead.

171
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
Where's the President? This may be him. Wait, hold on. This may be him.

172
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,300
Mr. President? He's still alive.

173
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,000
I repeat, the President is alive.

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,600
We need medivac teams in here ASAP. Did you read that? We need medivac teams in here.

175
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,500
I have Agent Buchanan for the Vice President.

176
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,900
Yes, he's right here. Bill Buchanan.

177
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Bill.

178
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:59,400
Mr. Vice President. I'm in direct contact with the rescue teams at the crash site of Air Force One. President Keeler is alive.

179
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,900
Thank God!

180
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,700
Yes, Sir.

181
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,800
But he's in critical condition. He is unconscious, he's lost a lot of blood,

182
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:17,100
there's no chance he's going to be able to lead this country, certainly not for a few days, and probably much longer.

183
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,600
Mr. Vice President?

184
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
Yes, I'm here.

185
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,100
This is all confirmed?

186
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,600
The President is being medivaced to the nearest emergency center as we speak.

187
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,100
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th amendment, and take control of things as soon as possible.

188
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,600
I understand. Thank you, Bill.

189
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
President Keeler is alive but he's incapacitated.

190
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,500
We should, uh¡­ we should probably contact the Cabinet members.

191
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,900
Actually, sir, I've already put that in motion. Most of the Cabinet members are standing-by. The others will be very soon.

192
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,400
You did without my permission?

193
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,200
I¡­ You had enough to worry about, sir. I thought it'd be best to be prepared.

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes. All right.

195
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Thank you.

196
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,500
Shall I begin the process of collecting votes?

197
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Yes, go ahead.

198
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
I can't get a signal.

199
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,900
Try up here.

200
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,700
Got it.

201
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,400
Kelly. Look at this.

202
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,900
what is it?

203
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm not sure, but if it's what I think it is¡­

204
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,600
I read this article once; I think it's got a funny name, umm¡­ I can't remember

205
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,300
but it's got our nuclear codes. It goes everywhere the President goes, and he can launch an attack from it.

206
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,800
We gotta call somebody.

207
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Who are you gonna call?

208
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,700
I'll start with the police, I guess. They'll put us through to the right people.

209
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,100
The Football transponder's signal's still strong.

210
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,900
Hello?

211
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
Hey, it's me.

212
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Look, when I walked away from you at CTU, I felt like you didn't understand what I was trying to say.

213
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm not telling you that you shouldn't care. I care. I care about you. I care about what happened to Paul, I feel completely responsible for it.

214
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,900
But right now this country is under attack, and I've got a job to do, and I don't have a choice.

215
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Jack, I understand. What you have to do is very important.

216
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,100
I just didn't want us to leave things like that.

217
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm glad. Me neither.

218
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,300
Audrey, hold on a second. I gotta take this call.

219
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,600
Wait, Jack. Take the call. Stay focused on what you have to do.

220
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,100
Yeah, I'll talk to you in a little while.

221
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,200
- OK.
- Bye.

222
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
This is Bauer.

223
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Jack, it's Tony.

224
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I got a guy on the line the police put through. He's in the desert, says he found a case.

225
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Jack, this guy found the Football.

226
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
OK. Let me speak to him.

227
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
All right. His name's Jason Gerard. We're running a background check as we speak.

228
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,900
I'm patching him through right now.

229
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,300
OK. Tony, stay on the other line.

230
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Mr. Gerard?

231
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,600
Yeah. Hey, call me Jason. I'm with my wife Kelly. Who's this?

232
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,300
Jason, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm a Federal Agent with the Department of Defense.
My colleague Agent Almeida says you found what we refer to as ¡°the Football¡±.

233
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah, it sure looks that way.

234
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,000
I mean, I don't know very much about this sort of thing. My wife and I are just out here on a camping trip.

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,800
OK, fine. Why don't you just describe to me what you found?

236
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,200
Sure. It's a black-leather briefcase; it's got a number paneling over by the handle.

237
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,200
It was in a protective case that had the Presidential seal on it.

238
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Well, that sounds like it.

239
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,000
Right now I'm in a helicopter. I'm about 20 minutes away from you. Look, I just want you to hang out there and wait for me.

240
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,500
I think someone beat you to the punch. I see headlights.

241
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,300
How far away?

242
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,400
Uh, it's hard to tell. A few miles?

243
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,000
OK, just hold on a second, Jason.

244
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,700
Tony. This kid Jason says he's got headlights headed towards him. Do we have any ground units in his vicinity?

245
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
No.

246
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,600
How about patrol park rangers, anything?

247
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,700
No, nobody.

248
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,800
How can that be?

249
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,000
We're spread thin, Jack. All state agencies are still assisting with the evacuation.

250
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,500
Jason, are the headlights headed straight for you?

251
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,300
Yeah. They're pretty much coming this way.

252
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,300
Dammit. This situation just got a lot more complicated than we thought.

253
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,400
What do you mean?

254
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:54,000
The Football has a transponder. It's a tracking device that allows anyone to pinpoint its exact location, as long as they've got the right frequency.

255
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,700
Do you think someone got a hold of the frequency, who's not supposed to have it?

256
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
Right now we're gonna have to make that assumption.

257
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Well, who do you think it is?

258
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,800
The terrorists who carried out today's attacks.

259
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,700
Listen, if I'm right we don't have a lot of time.

260
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,000
I need you to remove the transponder and take the Football, and get away from there as far as you can.

261
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,800
Uh¡­ All right.

262
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,700
Flashlight. Get your light.

263
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
OK, uh¡­ Go ahead.

264
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,100
The transponder's tiny, and it's hidden in the surface of the case. It's designed not to be found.

265
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,000
Then how am I supposed to find it?

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,900
Do you have a compass and a flashlight?

267
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,200
Uh, yeah. Get the compass.

268
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,000
OK, I want you to move the compass over the surface of the case slowly.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,700
The transponder puts out an electromagnetic field.

270
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,200
It's not very strong, but it should move the needle.

271
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,900
Just move the compass over the surface of the case slowly,

272
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,700
and watch the needle.

273
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Here, here, here. Get the beam of the compass.

274
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,800
I think I got it. I found it. I found it.

275
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,800
OK, good. Take a knife or a sharp rock, and start scratching the surface hard.

276
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Hurry.

277
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,900
- Dammit.
- Jason, they're coming.

278
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
Come on, Jason, talk to me.

279
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm working on it.

280
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,700
OK, I think I got it.

281
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,900
OK, I want you to take the compass, put it over the scraped area and tell me, is the needle moving?

282
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
No, no, it's not.

283
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,000
OK, you've disabled it. Good work. How far away is the vehicle?

284
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,100
Not far!

285
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,700
OK, I need you to take the Football and start moving. I don't care which direction, just start moving now. I'll get back to you.

286
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
We gotta go. We gotta go now.

287
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,400
Tony, I'm gonna need surveillance of the entire area put up to my screen.

288
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Why are we stopping?

289
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,400
We've lost the signal.

290
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
How is that possible?

291
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,100
I don't know. Maybe it was damaged on impact

292
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,200
And it just happens to malfunction now that we're getting closer?

293
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Scan the area for cell phones, active and passive signals.

294
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah?

295
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Jason. OK, we found a reserve power station about a half a mile north of you.

296
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,600
Yeah, that's right. I remember it from the map.

297
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,500
OK, I want you to go there now.

298
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
It's OK. Yeah. Yeah, we'll get there.

299
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,300
The station's a large unmanned facility. I want you to break in and find a place to hide. I want you to avoid using your flashlight, and as soon as you hang up,

300
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,800
I want you to take your cell batteries out.

301
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,600
The batteries?

302
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,700
Yeah, to prevent something called passive triangulation. In other words, it'll stop you from being followed.

303
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,200
What if I need to contact you?

304
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,000
If you need to contact me, put the batteries back in, but only if you have to.

305
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,900
Now, I'm gonna give you my direct line. Have you got a pen?

306
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,400
Yeah. Hold on.

307
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Go ahead.

308
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,900
3-1-0-5-9-7-3-7-8-1

309
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
OK, yeah, I got it.

310
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,600
Start moving now.

311
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,200
OK.

312
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,100
He said to take the battery out of the cell phone. Come on.

313
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,500
I had a cell phone signal for a few seconds. It's moving, but it's gone now.

314
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
Did it move enough to yield a vector?

315
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Wait. Yes, it was headed a few degrees west of north, just before we cut off.

316
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
Check the map. See if there's anything near there.

317
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,500
There's a reserve power plant. A kilometer away, maybe less.

318
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
Whoever has the Football, that's where they're heading.

319
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,800
This is it.

320
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,900
Stay back.

321
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
We're not in any danger, right?

322
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,600
I mean, how can anyone even know that we're here?

323
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,600
We're just being safe.

324
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,500
Not a relaxing weekend in the desert, just like I said¡­

325
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,900
They're here. I gotta call Jack.

326
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,100
Come on.

327
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,300
This is Bauer.

328
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,900
It's Jason. These terrorists you talked about? They're here.

329
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,900
How many?

330
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I just saw two jeeps.

331
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,800
Where are you?

332
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,300
Just inside the power plant. When are you going to get here?

333
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
Soon, just stand-by.

334
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,000
Go, Kelly, go, go.

335
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,800
Tony, it's Jack. We're out of time. We need the schematics for the power plant now.

336
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,400
Yeah, it should be on your screen in a few seconds.

337
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
OK, I got it. Thanks.

338
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Jason, you're still with me?

339
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,300
Yeah, I'm with you.

340
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,200
Which side of the building did you enter?

341
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
Uh¡­ The, the south side.

342
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
This is a large facility.

343
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,100
I want you to go to the lower level, southeast corner.

344
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,100
I'll find you there as soon as we land.

345
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,500
Ok.

346
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,100
Hey, hey, Agent Bauer? Please hurry.

347
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,800
We are.

348
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,200
Find them.

349
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
There's got to be stairs somewhere.

350
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Here they are, here they are.

351
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,000
Wait. What if it's a dead end?

352
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,600
There's a man and a woman.

353
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,800
Where are they?

354
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,100
This way.

355
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,500
They were down here.

356
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,400
Follow them and flush them out.

357
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,900
Go around and cut off the exits.

358
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,100
Go up there, go up there.

359
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,800
Come on, come on, come on.

360
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,600
Ok.

361
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,500
Anything?

362
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,300
Nothing.

363
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,300
Helicopter.

364
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,500
Intercept it.

365
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Ok.

366
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,400
Jason.

367
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,700
Where are you?

368
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,600
We just landed. We're approaching the building. Where are you?

369
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,200
We're inside the plant, on the lower level.

370
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,600
Jack! Jack!

371
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,000
Jason, you're still there?

372
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm here. They're inside the building. We cannot keep hiding. They are gonna find us.

373
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
I know. You gotta keep moving. I'll get back right back to you.

374
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,000
Edgar Stiles.

375
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,000
Edgar, it's Jack. I need to speak to Audrey Raines now.

376
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Ms. Raines, Jack's on line one.

377
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,700
Jack.

378
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
Audrey, I'm taking fire. The other agent's been killed.

379
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,900
I need the latch code for the Football now.

380
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,100
All right. Hang on.

381
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,500
Take the Football, take the Football! Come on.

382
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Jack. *76114.

383
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,800
I got it.

384
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,300
Hey.

385
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,000
Jason, I need you to open the case. The combination is *76114.

386
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Why? Where does that plant us?

387
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,700
Just do it. *76114.

388
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,600
He wants us to open the briefcase. *76114.

389
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,600
OK, it's open.

390
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
OK. Inside should be a phone, a control board and a book with colored pages. It's called the Playbook.

391
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,000
I want you to remove the Playbook. Give the case with the control board back to your wife. The two items need to stay separated.

392
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,400
Why?

393
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,700
Because the control board is useless without the Playbook.

394
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,399
I need you and your wife to split up.

395
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,100
He wants us to split up.

396
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,500
I can hear him.

397
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,900
I am not leaving my wife.

398
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,800
You have to.

399
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,800
Forget it.

400
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Jason, please listen to me. I know how scared you are

401
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
but if this man gets what he wants, he's gonna kill both of you.

402
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,800
Right now the only chance you have to survive is to separate, do you understand me?

403
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,000
It's OK, Jason. He's kept us alive this far. Let's just do what he says.

404
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,100
Just get here as fast as you can.

405
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:58,900
I will.

406
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,300
I love you.

407
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,100
I love you.

408
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,600
Give me the Playbook.

409
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,800
Here, you take the phone.

410
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:30,600
I want you to go to that top wile over there, all right? I'm gonna stay down here. You just find a place to hide, all right?

411
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,200
Go, go, go, go. Go. Hide, hide.

412
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,200
I've got him!

413
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,500
He's clean.

414
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,700
Where's the control board?

415
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,200
I¡­ I don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,600
Tell me what I want to know.

417
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
I swear, I don't know what you're talking about. Please.

418
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,400
It doesn't have to be this painful.

419
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,200
This is Bauer.

420
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
They've got my husband. They're hurting him.

421
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,000
Where are you? I'm on the lower level.

422
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,700
We had to leave. We're on the second floor. I don't know where.

423
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,200
OK, I'm on my way.

424
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
They're gonna kill him.

425
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Kelly, stay on the phone. Keep talking to me.

426
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,400
I can't.

427
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,900
Kelly!

428
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,600
Please...

429
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,300
Where is the control board?

430
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,400
Stop.

431
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,300
I have what you want.

432
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,100
Give it to me.

433
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
First, you let my husband go.

434
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
No!

435
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,000
OK. OK.

436
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'll give it to you if you promise not to kill us.

437
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,500
I won't kill you. I promise.

438
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,100
It's over there.

439
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's behind the pillar.

440
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,000
It's locked.

441
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,900
What is the code?

442
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,300
It's uh¡­ *76114.

443
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,300
It's here.

444
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,900
Let's go.

445
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,600
Kill them.

446
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,800
This is Jack Bauer. I need a medic. Second level, north end of the building.

447
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,200
It's all right. He's gonna be OK. Help is on the way.

448
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Where is the Football?

449
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
They have it. They went out that door.

450
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Don't be. You did great. Thank you.

452
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
Air support, two hostiles just left the building.

453
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,900
I do not have possession of the Football. I repeat, I do not have possession of the Football.

454
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,200
Air support, the Football is in the lead jeep headed north. Take it out.

455
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
I repeat, take it out.

456
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,000
Put your hands where I can see them!

457
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,000
Air support, I cannot see the Football in the vehicle. Shine your spotlight on me

458
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,800
and follow.

459
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,600
Air support, I'm in possession of the Football. Go after the other jeep.

460
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,500
Almeida.

461
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,500
Tony, it's Jack.

462
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
I'm in possession of the Football. Three hostiles are down, one escaped.

463
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.

464
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,900
I'm sorry, but I had to make a choice.

465
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
Marwan gave us the Football to buy his freedom?

466
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,100
Yeah, that doesn't sound right to me either.

467
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,500
What are you thinking?

468
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,300
I don't know.

469
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,600
Let me ask you something; Is anything missing?

470
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,000
No. All the components are here.

471
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,100
Hold on one second.

472
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,500
Tony, I was wrong.
There are some pages missing.

473
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,300
All right, look, Jack, the sections are color-coded. What's missing?

474
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
Red Chapter, Section Three.

475
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,000
Get Audrey.

476
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,500
All right. We'll call you right back.

477
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,600
You're worried about him.

478
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,800
I am. He seems unsure of himself.

479
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,300
No, Mike, trust me.

480
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,200
He spent his whole life preparing for this. He's just being cautious, feeling his way along. He'll be fine.

481
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,300
Yeah?

482
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,400
Well, the vote was unanimous. The 25th amendment's been officially invoked.

483
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,900
Tell the press we're ready. Let's get this done.

484
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,500
Mr. Vice President

485
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,100
the 25th amendment is in effect

486
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,000
Any descending votes?

487
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,800
None, sir.

488
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,000
Well, we should proceed with the sworning then.

489
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Yes, sir. The sworning will only take a minute, and then we'll take a short break and you can address the nation.

490
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm still not entirely certain that a live address makes much sense this time of night.

491
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,400
After what's happened today, sir, an awful lot of people are wide awake. I'm sure they'd like to hear from you directly.

492
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Yes, of course.

493
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,100
We're ready, sir.

494
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,000
Please. Please. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

495
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Yeah?

496
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,600
Jack, it's Tony.

497
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,000
Is Audrey there?

498
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Jack, I'm here.

499
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Tell me what the contents are of the missing pages.

500
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,900
Jack, it's the Red Section which contains warhead locations and activation codes.

501
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,500
But we started canceling all the activation codes as soon as Air Force One went down.

502
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,000
Yes, but there are thousands of warheads. It's gonna take an hour to clear the slate.

503
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,800
Jack, in the meantime, if they get a hold of a warhead and a matching activation code, we will not be able to stop them.

504
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

505
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,600
Mr. Novick's office.

506
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,100
Let me speak to Mike Novick.

507
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Yes, sir, right away.

508
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,600
I soundly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, and will, in the best of my ability,

509
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,300
preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.

510
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,487
Mr. President, I appreciate it.

511
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you coming at this late hour.

512
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,800
Novick.

513
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,700
Mike, it's Jack. We got a problem.

514
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,200
¡­to take this oath under tragic circumstances. Words cannot express the sense of sadness¡­

515
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,000
Part of the Football's been compromised.

516
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,900
Yes, I'll tell him.

517
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:49,900
Mr. President.

518
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,400
I just received a phone call from CTU.

519
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:01,100
I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but it appears that part of the Nuclear Football has fallen into the hands of terrorists.
