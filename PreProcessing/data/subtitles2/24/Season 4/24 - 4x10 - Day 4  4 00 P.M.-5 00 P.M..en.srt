1
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:15,516
The San Gabriel Island
reactor has just gone critical.

2
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,050
The core material
is now airborne.

3
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,916
<i>HELLER:
I thought we had more time.</i>

4
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:22,549
At this rem rate, the radiation
will continue getting stronger

5
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,116
and will spill
into the atmosphere

6
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:26,183
until the core
has exhausted itself.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,816
Son, you've done
everything you can.

8
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:29,417
Now get the hell out of there.

9
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:31,582
Evacuating won't make
any difference, sir.

10
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,050
We've already been exposed.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,882
Jack has got to
find the override

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,983
before the rest of these
reactors go critical.

13
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:39,087
I know about
you and him

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,216
and I am not
okay with it.

15
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,216
Look, you and I
aren't together anymore.

16
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:44,283
<i>PAUL: I thought we were
trying to work things out.</i>

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,683
Yeah, I tried.

18
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,116
But you kept putting it off.

19
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:48,549
What did you say to Paul?

20
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,250
That I'm filing for divorce.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,649
Somebody set me up.

<i>ERIN: Thousands of
people's lives are at stake.</i>

23

Where are the people
who control the override?

24
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,283
Talk to me, Sarah.

25

Erin, Powell's dead.

28
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:08,183
He was hit by a sniper

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,716
as soon as we took him
into custody.

30
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:11,849
Did you find out anything
from him before he was killed?

31
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,317
<i>No, but I managed to get
the last ten calls</i>

32
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:14,950
he made off his cell phone.

33
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:16,582
He called two numbers
repeatedly.

34
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,417
We traced one of them
to Maryanne Taylor.

35

You're under arrest.

36

Don't move!

37
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,916

Government agents found me.

41
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:34,883
I made a deal.

44

I'm going to help them
stop your father.

Mother will tell
them everything.

48

If you don't believe me,
look outside.

He's got nowhere to go but down!

Bring us up to speed.

69
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:27,849
We have a hostage situation

70

involving one of the men
that was involved in

71
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,649
the terrorist attacks
this morning.

72
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,383
ERIN:
I'm pulling up his I.D. now.

73
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,749
His name is Navi Araz.
The sleeper?

74

<i>ERIN: He was granted American
citizenship five years ago.</i>

75

Who's the hostage?

76
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:42,116
His 17-year-old
son, Behrooz.

77
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:45,116
He broke ranks and now his
father sees him as a liability.

78
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:46,983
Araz knows we have
his wife in custody.

79
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,449
He's worried that
if he kills

80
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,950
the boy, she'll betray him
by cooperating with us.

81
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,449
AUDREY:
What does she say?

82
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,383
ERIN: She's agreed to
help us find the override

83
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,250
and stop the nuclear meltdowns,
if we rescue her son.

84
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:00,116
So, the father will stall,
keep the kid alive

85
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:01,150
until the reactors blow.

86
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,616
That's right, sir.

87
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,417
We've already lost one
in California, Jack.

88
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,016
Can we trust
this woman to help us?

89
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,683
I think right now she'll
do everything she can

90
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:09,983
to protect her son.

91
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,816
Okay, Jack. Whatever
you need, you've got.

92
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:12,983
Just get that kid.

93
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,983
Yes, sir.

94
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,116
Erin, I'm going to need

95
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,616
a thermal satellite scan
of the building.

96
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,749
We're looking for two heat
sources in close proximity,

97
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:20,150
in remote areas of the basement.

98
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,916
I'll call you back

Why?

106
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:46,950
Because I don't want

00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,183
to kill innocent people?

108
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,849
Because you're weak
and you stand for nothing!

109

I always saw you
as something more

I don't even
recognize you.

Why so long?

135
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,183
The Americans
have programmers

trying to prevent
the meltdown.

137
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:51,150
That means we have to manipulate
each plant individually,

138

Where are the latest timing
estimates on the remaining

167
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:49,216
nuclear plants?

168
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,283
Right here.

169
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:52,749
These are from
40 minutes ago.

170
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:53,916
They update
every 15 minutes.

171
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,083
I'm sorry, Miss Driscoll.

172
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,683
I've been little upset
about my mother.

173
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:59,150
You have to put your emotions
on hold a little longer, Edgar.

174
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:00,449
We're in the middle
of a crisis.

175
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:01,816
My mother just died,
Miss Driscoll.

176
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:02,950
I can't put that on hold.

177
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,616
I'm sorry;
that was callous of me.

178
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,317
But I'm really depending
on you now, Edgar.

179
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,749
Please come through for me.

180
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:18,883
I'll get you those figures
as soon as we're done here.

181
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,883
Thank you.

182
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,516
HELLER:
All right,

183
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,783
bring me up to speed.

184
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,549
We're trying to hold off
the meltdown process

185
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:25,816
on five nuclear power plants.

186
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:27,516
How's that going?

187
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:29,150
Our programmers are trying
to fight off the override.

188
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,549
They can slow it down, but
they won't be able to stop it.

189
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,849
Which means we still have
to find the override.

190
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,883
EDGAR:
Yes.

191
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,250
Jack has a suspect cornered

192
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,716
at a local medical facility,

193
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,916
and we're fairly certain
this man he's pursuing

194
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,950
is one of the key architects
in today's events.

195
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:42,150
Can we take him alive?

196
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:43,283
Unknown.

197
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,317
What about
Maryanne Taylor?

198
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:45,616
I sent Curtis
to interrogate her.

199
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,050
I want to call my lawyer.

200
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,083
Really?

201
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,883
I do have rights.

202
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,282
Yeah?

203
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,750
Henry Powell
had rights, too.

204
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:17,349
I don't know any Henry Powell.

205
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,616
The one who helped the
terrorists obtain the override.

206
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,050
He's right here.

207
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:24,249
Want to say hello?

208
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,216
Bring him in.

209
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,683
You sick... sick bastard.

210
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,282
CTU didn't kill him.

211
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:49,650
Well, then who did?

212
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:52,149
The same people who planted
the bomb under your car.

213
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,650
Whoever they are,
they've caught up with you.

214
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:59,017
Even if we let you go,
you'd be dead in 15 minutes.

215
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,549
Get him out of here.

216
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:17,750
Your only chance to survive
is to tell us what you know.

217
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:19,650
I want a deal.

218
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:20,916
You get to live.

219
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,149
That's your deal.

220
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,650
All right.

221
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,149
Who did you and Powell work for?

222
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:32,549
I don't know.

223
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,316
I only dealt with him.

224
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,850
Why did he send you into CTU?

225
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,783
To cover his tracks in
case he became a suspect.

226
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,182
And after Audrey Raines
saw him at the warehouse,

227
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,216
it became necessary?

228
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,850
Y es.

229
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,416
Did Powell work directly
for the terrorists,

230
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,449
or for someone else
associated with the terrorists?

231
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:50,316
I told you- I don't know.

232
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,516
I need names!

233
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,282
People who can get us
to the override.

234
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,483
I don't have any names!

235
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:00,850
But I-I can get them for you.

236
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:01,950
How?

237
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:05,916
Powell kept a file
on his computer

238
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,549
at his office downtown.

239
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:10,249
It was a... an insurance policy

240
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,683
in case either of us ever needed

241
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,950
a bargaining chip.

242
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:15,683
Give me the address
and the access code.

243
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,249
It can't be accessed externally.

244
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,182
It requires a thumbprint
identification-

245
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,583
either his or mine.

246
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,282
Since he's dead...

247
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,616
it'll have to be mine.

248
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,383
All right, you set?

249
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:32,383
TONY:
Yeah.

250
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,683
We think we found them.

251
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,316
Where? The basement,
in the laundry room.

252
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:38,182
Our satellite picked up
two thermal images.

253
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,282
Then Behrooz is still alive.

254
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:41,650
Yes.

255
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,483
I'm going to need you
to distract your husband.

256
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,950
I'm going to take you
down to the basement.

257
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,716
In one minute, we're going
to have you call your husband.

258
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,182
We need you to keep him on the
line as long as possible. All right.

259
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,282
Let's go.

260
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,750
Okay.

261
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:00,983
You ready?

262
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,083
Ready.

263
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,416
Okay, keep going.

264
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,249
Six feet...

265
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,716
four feet...

266
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:13,850
three feet...

267
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,149
Stop.

268
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,750
All right, come here.

269
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,449
Okay, make the call.

270
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:28,483
Remember, keep him on
as long as you can.

271
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,783
<i>( phone rings )</i>

272
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:39,716
Yes?

273
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:40,750
It's Dina.

274
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,549
Where are you?

275
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:43,983
Still in the hospital.

276
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,483
What have you told them?!

277
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,883
Nothing.

278
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,083
And I'll keep my mouth shut
if you release our son.

279
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,616
You know I can't do that.

280
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,050
Then at least promise me
you won't kill him.

281
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,916
Is he still alive?

282
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:09,349
Yes...

283
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,583
and he'll remain alive,
as long as you remain silent.

284
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,583
I have a visual on the suspect.

285
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,950
The boy is still alive.

286
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:26,816
I'm ready to proceed.

287
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:27,883
Go.

288
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,650
Slowly retract the rig.

289
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,149
I'm in position.

290
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:04,549

291
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:12,750
Don't... move.

292
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:36,416
Get up slowly.

293
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,950
Put your hands
on your head!

294
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,316
Stay with her.

295
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:42,683
Put your hands on your...

00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,182

301
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,050
Interlock your fingers.

Just put the gun down.

00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,883
It's over.

307
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,783
TONY:
Drop the gun!

308
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,883
Tony, don't shoot!
Drop the gun!

309
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:53,117
Please, son, put the gun down.

Hands on your head!

312
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,383
Turn around.

313
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,182
Behrooz, are you all right?

314
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:16,216
I killed him!

315
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,616
Your son is safe.

316
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,750
He's alive.
We did what you asked.

317
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:23,249
Now, where is the
override device?

318
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,282
I don't know that,
but I can give you an address

319
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,616
where much of the work
behind today's attacks was done.

320
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:29,916
That's not the deal we made.

321
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:31,050
That's all I know.

322
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,916
I can only tell you
what I know.

323
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:33,983
What's the address?

324
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,383
24878 Alvert Street.

325
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:38,850
What's there?

326
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,216
It was a drop-off.

327
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,050
The place we used
to get our final assignment.

328
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,916
It was the last place
I saw the men

329
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,017
who were going to take
possession of the override.

330
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,249
When was that?

331
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:49,650
Yesterday.

332
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,017
Send in an advance team.

333
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,516
Tell them to set up
a hard perimeter.

334
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,117
No one goes in there
until we get there.

335
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,750
You got it.
What about these two?

336
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,216
Until we know she's not lying,
they come with us.

337
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,000
So this Maryanne Taylor claims

338
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,533
she has to access
the file personally.

339
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes, she does.

340
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,234
And do you believe her?

341
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,034
I'm not sure.

342
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,301
The polygraph indicates
that she's telling the truth.

343
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,934
But in my opinion,

344
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,100
she may be a sociopath.

345
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,867
Are you a psychologist?

346
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:34,500
No, but I have had dealings
with her before.

347
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,633
Dealings that might
affect your judgment?

348
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,667
No.

349
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,301
Well, we have
to check it out.

350
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:40,366
The question is how.

351
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:41,600
I can spare
an operative

352
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,600
from the cyber unit

353
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,967
and a security team.

354
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,034
What do you think?

355
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,600
I think Curtis should go.

356
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,234
I need Curtis here.

357
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:50,100
AUDREY: The information in the
computer file may be important.

358
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,700
Someone with experience needs
to examine it firsthand.

359
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,533
HELLER:
I agree.

360
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,034
Send Curtis with a security team

361
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,533
and you'll have
to figure out

362
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
how to do without him
till he gets back.

363
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,600
Yes, sir.

364
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,734
I don't like this.

365
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,200
Either do I,
but those are our orders.

366
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,500
Get it done and get back
here as quickly as you can.

367
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,367
Okay.

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,634
You okay?

369
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,734
Anything you need?

370
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,966
I'm fine.

371
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:37,300
You understand,
Sarah, I had no choice.

372
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,300
You were identified
as a threat to security

373
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,600
and I acted accordingly.

374
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,233
I would have hoped
you had more faith in me.

375
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,267
Personally, I do.

376
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,167
But the evidence
was brought to me

377
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,867
by the Secretary of Defense,

378
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,667
and I couldn't
very well ignore it.

379
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,966
So what happens now?

380
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,400
You can go home and rest.

381
00:16:56,467 --> 00:17:00,801
No one would blame you
if you did.

382
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,801
But if you're up to it,
I could use you on the floor.

383
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,567
The San Gabriel Island
reactor went into meltdown

384
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,801
less than an hour ago.

385
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,567
The five remaining
plants are critical.

386
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:14,267
I need my best people
in play.

387
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,033
I'll go back to work.

388
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,567
Thank you, Sarah.

389
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,834
It shouldn't
be too complicated.

390
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:33,933
Building security is light.
I have a keycard

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,767
that'll get us
into Powell's office.

392
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,333
How long is it going to take?

393
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,500
Five minutes to get up
to his office,

394
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,500
another five
to download the data.

395
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:40,767
We're looking at a 15-minute

396
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,333
operation time?
Approximately.

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,700
If I think you're stalling,

398
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,434
taking longer
than you should,

399
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,966
I will take action.

400
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,634
You got that?

401
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,801
Raise your leg.

402
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,734
Don't make me do it for you.

403
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
Curtis, I'm not going to run.

404
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:09,434
Then you won't mind
wearing it.

405
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,734
Can I put
my foot down now?

406
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,267
Yes.

407
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,300
Look, I realize
that after today,

408
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,834
you have a hard time
trusting me,

409
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,367
but if we're going to pull this
off, you're going to have to...

410
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:28,066
I don't have to do anything
except retrieve the data

411
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,267
your boyfriend had
and put you in jail for treason.

412
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,901
Is that what
you really want?

413
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:36,534
Without a doubt.

414
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,933
Curtis...

415
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,100
Get your hand off me.

416
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,500
I spoke with Mike
at the local D.O.D. office.

417
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,734
He wants to know who you want

418
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:57,567
to bring in to help manage
with their load.

419
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,233
Things are too unstable

420
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,700
for me to leave here.

421
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,167
I have to keep my eye
on tactical.

422
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,267
Well, I checked with their logs,
and they're going to need

423
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,700
someone pretty soon.

424
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,100
How are you holding up?

425
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,901
I can handle it,
if that's what you mean.

426
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,734
Dad, it'll be fine.

427
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:18,233
Why don't you head over there,
then?

428
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,734
I'll call you from there.

429
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,667
Sarah, you're back.

430
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,100
Yeah.

431
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,801
I heard some rumors about
what they were doing...

432
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:34,966
I'll be all right.

433
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:37,500
Just bring me up to speed.

434
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,167
Sure.

435
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,400
We're still trying
to find the override.

436
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,534
It's the only way
we're going to stop

437
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,767
the remaining plants
from melting down.

438
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,500
What have you gotten
out of Maryanne so far?

439
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,834
She claims she has access
to a computer

440
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,300
that has data on it
about the override.

441
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,500
And which computer is this?

442
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,066
She's taking Curtis
over to it now.

443
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,700
They let her out
of the building?

444
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,066
Yeah. He's got a security team
with him.

445
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,600
And we trust her because...?

446
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,933
She's trying
to cut a deal.

447
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,901
Agent Bauer.
Agent Salars.

448
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:16,901
Agent Almeida.

449
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,333
Did you set
your perimeter yet?

450
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,734
Anything inside four blocks
is not going anywhere.

451
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,033
Any activity?

452
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,867
Not that we've seen.

453
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:22,801
Okay, I want to keep this

454
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:23,667
as surgical as possible.

455
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:24,867
You, me, and Almeida will be

456
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:25,901
the insertion team.

457
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:27,367
Your men will maintain backup.

458
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,200
You ready?

459
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,734
Yeah.

460
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,534
Go.

461
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,933
We're clear!

462
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:56,067
Dina must have been lying.

463
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:57,033
I don't think so.

464
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,467
She wants to save her son.

465
00:20:58,534 --> 00:21:00,200
Well, then they must have
cleared this place out.

466
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:01,700
Bring in
a forensics team now.

467
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:02,633
I want this place

468
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,033
torn apart
for fingerprints.

469
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,067
Yes, sir.

470
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,733
Tony.

471
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,234
What is it?

472
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,800
Go.

473
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,267
It's clear.

474
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,567
That's the train
they attacked this morning.

475
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,967
So that's how the terrorists
got ahold of the override.

476
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:56,434
Jack?

477
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:11,100
They planned
the kidnapping here.

478
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,700
Yeah.

479
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,477
Edgar, the location
Jack is searching

480
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:29,278
didn't show up
on any agency watch list.

481
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:31,345
Yeah, well, I'm having
a hell of a time here.

482
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:32,477
Why?

483
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,844
The building is owned
by a company

484
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,312
that's owned
by another company,

485
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:36,444
that's owned by an LLC.

486
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:37,911
<i>( typing )</i>

487
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,145
Galaxy Financial?

488
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,145
I've heard that name before.

489
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,444
No, Hal, I want you to put
that in a separate file.

490
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:56,412
We'll handle the kidnapping and
the train bombing another day.

491
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,477
Right now, I only want
things that are pertinent

492
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:00,145
to helping us find
the override device.

493
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,511
Okay, I'll have it up on the system
when you get here. Okay, thanks.

494
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:05,312
( phone rings ) Tony,
look, I need to talk to you.

495
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:06,644
I'm sorry.

496
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,878
Just give me a minute.

497
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:09,878
Yeah.

498
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,577
Jack, this is Sarah from CTU.

499
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:13,978
Listen, I got something on
that address you gave to Edgar.

500
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,978
What is it?

501
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,577
The ownership of the
building is complicated,

502
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:19,878
but I recognize one of the shell
corporations on the ladder.

503
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:20,878
Which one?

504
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:22,011
Galaxy Financial.

505
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,278
I never heard of it.

506
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:25,544
Neither did I
until this afternoon.

507
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,778
When Paul Raines came in,

508
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:28,211
I was the one
who ran his clearance.

509
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,744
Paul Raines? What does he have
to do with the company?

510
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:31,945
He's a general partner
in Galaxy Financial.

511
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,011
You're telling me that Audrey's
husband owns the building

512
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:36,312
that was used by the terrorists
to plan this morning's attacks?

513
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:38,211
According to this, yes.

514
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,111
Where's Audrey now?

515
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,577
She's on her way over to D.O.D.

516
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:42,644
Patch her through to me.

517
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:48,178
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

518
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:49,378
Yeah.

519
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,678
Miss Raines, this
is Sarah from CTU.

520
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:51,644
I've got Jack.

521
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,412
Hold please.
All right.

522
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,011
Jack, I've got
Audrey on the line.

523
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:00,211
Audrey, it's me.

524
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,711
Hey, did you find
anything at the address?

525
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:03,444
Yeah, the building was used
by the terrorists

526
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:04,678
to plan this morning's attacks.

527
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:06,178
Jack, that's a great find.

528
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:07,312
Yeah, there's something else.

529
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:08,711
What?

530
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:10,312
The company
that owns the building,

531
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:12,078
it's called
Galaxy Financial Services.

532
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:13,412
Have you ever heard of them?

533
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,644
No. Should I have?

534
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:17,577
Your husband is
the chief financial officer.

535
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:19,611
What?

536
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:21,211
Audrey, the information is true.

537
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:22,611
CTU just verified it.

538
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:24,711
I need to find Paul.
I need to speak to him now.

539
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:27,045
Paul had nothing to do
with the kidnapping.

540
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:27,978
Maybe, maybe not.

541
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:28,978
But his name is all over

542
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,477
the paperwork for the building.

543
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:32,211
Because of his relationship
to you and your father,

544
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,644
he's going to have
to explain that.

545
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:34,911
Jack, I don't
know where he is.

546
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:37,278
He left CTU without
saying anything.

547
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,278
Can you reach him?

548
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,278
What? Yeah, I have

549
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:40,211
his cell phone number.

550
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:41,378
Okay, I want you
to call him.

551
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:42,678
I want you to
keep it personal.

552
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:44,378
I don't want you to
tell him what I know.

553
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:46,945
I just want you
to tell me where he is.

554
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:50,477
Audrey, five power plants
could still melt down.

555
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:52,811
If Paul has any information
that can help us stop that

556
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,511
from happening, we have
to follow through with it.

557
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:55,544
You know that.

558
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,245
All right.

559
00:25:59,312 --> 00:26:01,711
Please get back to me
as soon as you can.

560
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:02,978
Okay, I will.

563
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:27,978
Hello.

564
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,011
Hey... Paul, it's Audrey.

565
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:33,345
I wasn't expecting
to hear from you.

566
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:34,844
I know, I was just...

567
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,878
Look, Paul, I-I didn't like the
way we left things between us.

568
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,945
I didn't care
for it much either.

569
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:42,945
Look, uh, I'm glad
you called, but, uh,

570
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:44,945
I'm about to check out.

571
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:46,211
Where you going?

572
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:47,744
What difference does it make?

573
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:51,844
Look, Paul, I was thinking
about what you said,

574
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:55,811
about how... we've got
so much going on for us.

575
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:57,878
I thought
you wanted a divorce.

576
00:26:57,945 --> 00:26:59,945
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but...

577
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:01,945
You know, Paul,
today was the first time

578
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:05,844
that we've seen each other
in months, and...

579
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:09,644
I don't know, maybe it took
a while for it to sink in.

580
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,412
Maybe you're right.

581
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,945
Maybe there is something there.

582
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:20,145
Audrey, you know this is what
I want, more than anything.

583
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:21,811
Then let me come over.

584
00:27:21,878 --> 00:27:23,278
I don't want to have

585
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:27,245
the most important conversation
of my life over the phone.

586
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,145
All right, I'm at
the Westmore, Room 408.

587
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,577
All right, I'll be there soon.

588
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:34,011
I'll wait for you.

589

<i>( grunts )</i>

590
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:40,778
Okay, no one goes
back down there

591
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:42,178
until the forensic team
gets here.

592
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,945
When they do,
I want the place torn apart.

593
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:45,577
I want fingerprints,
trace DNA samples,

594
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:46,678
fiber samples, everything,

595
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,145
you understand?
I understand.

596
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:49,577
Okay.

597
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:55,111
Hey, I need to follow up
on my own.

598
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:57,477
I need you to do me a favor.

599
00:27:57,544 --> 00:28:00,145
I need you to take Dina Araz
and her son back to CTU

600
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,744
and head up the interrogation.

601
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:03,312
Wait a second, Jack.

602
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:05,378
They'll never let me step foot
in CTU, even if I wanted to.

603
00:28:05,444 --> 00:28:06,678
Tony, listen.

604
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:08,011
You're the only one
I can trust to do this.

605
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:10,111
Over the last two hours,
I watched

606
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:11,245
my friend
come back to life.

607
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:12,378
It's not that simple, Jack.

608
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:13,378
If I press hard enough,

609
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:14,611
I can get you reinstated.

610
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,511
But I need to know now,
is that what you want?

611
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,412
I don't know.

612
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,644
Maybe I was wrong.

613
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:30,178
You saved the life
of the daughter

614
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:33,045
of the Secretary of Defense
who happens to be my boss.

615
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,312
You do know that, right?

Yeah.

623
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:00,811
All right, Jack.
I spoke with Paul.

624
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:02,245
He's at the Westmore downtown,

625
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:04,245
Room 408. I'm heading
over there now.

626
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:05,844
No, Audrey! You need
to let us handle this.

627
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,778
We don't know Paul's
connections to the attack yet.

628
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:08,878
He could be dangerous.

629
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,278
Jack, I don't think
we have a choice.

630
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:11,611
He was on his way
out the door.

631
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:13,844
I had to make something up
just to keep him there.

632
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:15,378
Fine, I can get
there instead.

633
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:18,145
Jack, I'm only a couple minutes
away and he knows that.

634
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,744
He's not going to stick
around if I don't show up.

635
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:22,544
Audrey, I know you're trying
to help, but

636
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:24,412
I don't feel comfortable with
you going in that room alone.

637
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:25,412
Jack, it's the only thing

638
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:26,412
that he won't suspect.

639
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,412
He's been wanting to talk

640
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:28,412
about the marriage all day long.

641
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,045
Look, I'll keep him there

642
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,345
until you get there.

643
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:32,778
No, it's not an option.

644
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:35,544
Jack, just get there
as soon as you can, please.

645
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:38,278
Audrey. Audrey!

646

Erin, I just

647
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,240
got off the
phone with Jack.

648
00:29:57,307 --> 00:29:58,473
He wants me
to approve

649
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,040
Tony Almeida's reinstatement.

650
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:01,839
Do you have a problem with that?

651
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:04,106
Considering what Almeida
has done for us today,

652
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,773
I do not have
a problem with that.

653
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,806
Good.

654
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,440
Sir, you said
you spoke with Jack.

655
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,873
How long ago was that?

656
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,173
Ten, fifteen minutes ago. Why?

657
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,407
We have some new information
I'd like to share with you.

658
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:15,973
We found a curious

659
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,073
connection to the terrorists.

660
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,507
What kind of connection?

661
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:21,073
Paul Raines.

662
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,973
My daughter's husband?

663
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,739
One of his companies

664
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:27,207
is listed as the owner of the
building Jack just searched.

665
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:29,973
The building the terrorists
planned the attack from today?

666
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,006
That's the one.

667
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:33,140
Has anybody gone to pick him up?

668
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,173
We have teams on the way
to the hotel where he's staying,

669
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,140
but he was about to leave,
and the only way

670
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:40,240
to keep him there
was under a false pretense.

671
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:41,640
False pretense.
What's that supposed to mean?

672
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,073
Jack called to tell us
that Audrey's meeting Paul

673
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,173
in his room. Jack's
on his way over there.

674
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,373
What?!

675
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,839
She's going to try
and keep him there

676
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:50,473
until our backup teams
can take over.

677
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,706
Unacceptable.

678
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,106
How could you
let this happen?!

679
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:54,173
This wasn't
my decision.

680
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,473
This was her choice.

681
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,839
Jack did everything
he could to stop her.

682
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,574
When did you
find out about this?

683
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,607
About five minutes ago.

684
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,574
That's when you
should have told me.

685
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:08,906
Yeah.

686
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,207
Find out.

687
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,140
Tell me everything you know
about Paul Raines.

688
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,340
Why?

689
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,873
What's his connection
to all this?

690
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,140
How should I know?

691
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,806
Look, Curtis,
I wish I knew

692
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:24,773
something that
you could use.

693
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,473
Believe me,
I'm quite clear

694
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,207
it's my only
way out of this,

695
00:31:28,273 --> 00:31:29,540
but I don't
know any more

696
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,473
about Paul Raines
than you do.

697
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:36,940
How much longer?

698
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,839
We're about five minutes out.

699
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:44,207
Raines's part in all this is
being investigated as we speak.

700
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:47,240
If your name turns up linked to
the kidnapping in any way...

701
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,773
It won't.

702
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,473
I am going to do
everything I can

703
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,640
to find something in Powell's
computer that will help you.

704
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:56,473
Maybe something about Paul
Raines will be on there.

705
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:06,973
<i>( phone rings )</i>

706
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:08,906
Yeah.

707
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,173
What's this I hear about you

708
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,574
going to see Paul by yourself?

709
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,173
It's the only way
to keep him here.

710
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,140
If Paul was involved
in our kidnapping...

711
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:17,073
Look, Paul would never hurt me.

712
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,307
There is strong evidence
to suggest that he was involved,

713
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,773
which means he is dangerous.

714
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,440
Look, I don't believe he is.

715
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,207
You don't know
what he is, Audrey.

716
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:28,040
I've lived with him
for eight years.

717
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:29,040
I know him.

718
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:30,640
Yeah, I thought I knew him, too.

719
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:33,073
Audrey, I forbid you to do this.

720
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,574
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm already here.

721
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:50,307
Mr. Almeida.

722
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:51,373
That's right.

723
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,307
Erin Driscoll,

724
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:54,373
Director of CTU.

725
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,739
How are you?

726
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:58,706
Uh, this is Mrs. Araz
and her son, Behrooz.

727
00:32:58,773 --> 00:33:01,373
Mrs. Araz is in need of
medical attention right away.

728
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,674
Have her taken care of and
prepare them for interrogation.

729
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,407
We've told you
everything we know.

730
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:06,574
We'll see.

731
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,106
You're going
to need these?

732
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,407
<i>( sighs )</i>

733
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:13,674
Miss Driscoll,

734
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:15,507
I'm sure you're aware
of my history here.

735
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:16,507
Not an issue.

736
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,073
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller

737
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,106
both vouch for you.
That's enough for me.

738
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,873
Thank you.

739
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,507
Uh, Jack thought
it'd be a good idea

740
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:26,973
if I headed up
the interrogation.

741
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,240
That makes sense.

742
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:31,640
You've had the chance
to observe them firsthand.

743
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:34,340
If there's anything
you need, let me know.

744
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,906
That man I was
just talking to

745
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,040
is Tony Almeida.

746
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,806
I want you to keep
an eye on him.

747
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:51,674
Let me know if he
goes off protocol.

748
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,607
I'm particularly
interested in...

749
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:55,006
...in any communication

750
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:56,839
between him and Jack Bauer
or Secretary Heller.

751
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:58,140
That's right.

752
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,873
I'm beginning to see how
things work around here,

753
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,006
Miss Driscoll.

754
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,507
How do things work around here?

755
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:06,040
You can care less
about me being

756
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:07,440
falsely accused
and tortured.

757
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:09,607
You're beginning
to feel squeezed out

758
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:10,839
and you need allies.

759
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,006
That's why you were
so nice to me before.

760
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:15,806
We're facing a
crisis today, Sarah,

761
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:18,273
and our first priority is to
deal with it successfully.

762
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,440
Is that a problem for you?

763
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:23,273
Not at all,

764
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,006
but after what I
went through today,

765
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:27,040
if you want my help,
I need something, too.

766
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,739
And what's that?

767
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,973
I want my arrest expunged.

768
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,873
Not explained
by an official letter

769
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,407
in my file- expunged,

770
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,140
and I want a promotion,
two pay grades.

771
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
Done.

772
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:51,040
<i>( knocking at door )</i>

773
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:01,906
Come on in.

774
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,473
I'm glad you came.

775
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,607
Can I get you
something?

776
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,839
Sure.

777
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,240
I had them send up
your favorite champagne.

778
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:21,640
To tell you the truth,
I, uh...

779
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,574
wasn't sure you'd really come.

780
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,073
Why wouldn't I?

781
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,940
You were so adamant
before about ending things.

782
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:29,040
Your turnaround
was just

783
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:30,873
a little surprising, that's all.

784
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,507
How about you?

785
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:40,940
I hardly hear from you
for about six months

786
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,507
and then you see me
with another man

787
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,273
and suddenly
you're pouring Don Perignon.

788
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,173
It shows what a fool I am
for not realizing what I had.

789
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,340
It also shows

790
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:54,574
that I still have
feelings for you,

791
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,373
and you must have some
for me, too-

792
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,574
otherwise you wouldn't
be here, right?

793
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,173
I would hate to think

794
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,607
you are playing
some kind of game with me.

795
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:10,273
I don't play games, Paul.

796
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,640
Okay.

797
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,574
To new beginnings?

798
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,839
New beginnings.

799
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:50,267
Miss Driscoll,
it's Jack on line three.

800
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:53,966
Jack.

801
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,634
Are the backup teams
at the Westmore yet?

802
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:57,267
No. They were
caught up in traffic.

803
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm still a couple
miles out.

804
00:36:58,567 --> 00:36:59,767
If your teams
get there first,

805
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:00,900
tell them not
to waste time

806
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:02,267
coordinating
with hotel security.

807
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,200
I want them in that room
as soon as possible.

808
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:06,133
Why not put some fiber
optics in place first,

809
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,500
get a better
position on Raines?

810
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,500
Because, if Paul's involved,
he's gonna be nervous.

811
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:11,300
I don't want anything
to possibly tip him off

812
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,833
before we're ready
to enter that room.

813
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,233
I don't want Audrey
in any more danger

814
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
than she already is.

815
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,667
Okay, I'll pass that
along to Tactical.

816
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,000
Has Curtis had
a chance to question

817
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,133
Maryanne about Paul yet?

818
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,367
She says she doesn't know

819
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:21,966
anything about him,
but they're about

820
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,167
to get into the computer files.

821
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:24,367
That might help us
find the override.

822
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:25,966
Okay, thanks, Erin.

823
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:30,167
It's right down this
hall and to the left.

824
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,000
Stay alert.

825
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,900
This place may not be
as empty as it seems.

826
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:37,900
What, you think

827
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:39,067
this is some kind of trap?

828
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,634
Yes, I do.

829
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:41,833
Like you said, Curtis.

830
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,701
This is my only chance
to stay alive.

831
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm not going
to blow it, so relax.

832
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,500
Okay?

833
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,100
All clear, Curtis.

834
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:37,133
This will only take one minute.

835
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:46,634
Here it is.

836
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,000
All I have to do
is reformat

837
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,933
and then we can download
the data and get out of here.

838
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:56,833
Paul.

839
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,866
What?

840
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,767
The file has a second
password encryption.

841
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:01,966
Do you know it?

842
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:05,534
I think so...
but it's strange.

843
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,033
<i>( gunshot )</i>

844
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,033
Take your hand
away from the gun.

845
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,734
Take it away.

846
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,933
The files are still secure.

847
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,400
I-I didn't give
them anything. I...

848
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:32,567
Now put the gun down.

849
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:42,367
Put it down.

850
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,100
Your name is Curtis Manning.

851
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,500
You work for CTU.

852
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:01,833
You're going to tell me

853
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,801
how far along you are
in your investigation.

854
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:05,600
What investigation?

855
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:06,701
Of the override.

856
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,500
Have they discovered
where it is yet?

857
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,866
You're an American

858
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:13,200
and you're working
with the terrorists.

859
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,467
Who are you?

860
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

861
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,634
What does CTU know
about the override?

862
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:26,667
Fine.

863
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,434
Or...

864
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,033
I could move
to Washington.

865
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,067
I could turn West
Coast operations

866
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,367
over to Ben Simon.

867
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,133
Audrey.

868
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,133
Yes, I-I heard you.

869
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,334
Turn West Coast operations
over to Ben Simon.

870
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,701
What do you think?

871
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,467
I don't know.
I-I guess you'd have to decide

872
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:15,067
whether or not you thought
he was capable of running...

873
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,534
Not what do you think
of Ben Simon.

874
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,367
Wh-What do you think
of me moving back east?

875
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,434
Oh, um...

876
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,467
Well, I-I, I don't know.

877
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,367
I feel like I'm
doing all the work here.

878
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:32,833
You said you
wanted to talk.

879
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,100
You're not talking.

880
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,300
These things take time, Paul.

881
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:41,167
Well, maybe...

882
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,833
talking isn't what
we should be doing.

883
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,966
Why are you looking
at me like that?

884
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,734
You're my wife,

885
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,634
for God's sake.

886
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:58,100
You can't believe that I came
over here to sleep with you.

887
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,767
Okay, you didn't
come over here to sleep with me.

888
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,300
You didn't come over to talk
with me. Why did you come?

889
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,400
I just... I thought that

890
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:05,534
maybe we could spend
a little time together.

891
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,534
It would be nice.

892
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,200
On-on a day like this?

893
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:10,334
All hell's breaking loose.

894
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,567
You thought it
would be nice

895
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:13,300
for us to spend
some time together?

896
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:16,067
Well, I guess I really wasn't
thinking when you called, was I?

897
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,133
What are you doing here?

898
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,167
What's really going on?

899
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,300
Are you spying on me?

900
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,100
Are you doing something
worth spying on?

901
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,933
What is that supposed to mean?!

902
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,167
I just...

903
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:26,267
Maybe I should go.

904
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:27,567
I think you should stay!

905
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:28,767
Please, just let me go.
No!

906
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:29,600
No!

907
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,701
Let go of my cell phone.

908
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:32,833
Take your hands off of her!

909
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,933
You set me up!

910
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:36,567
Audrey, get behind me.

911
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:38,767
Put your hands
on your head now!

912
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,367
Now!

913
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,567
What do you want?

914
00:42:44,634 --> 00:42:47,467
I want answers.

915
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:50,833
Well, I'm not
talking to you.

916
