1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.95

2
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:15,407
Jack, look out!

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,121
Paul!

4
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,415
Get me a Medic!

5
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:20,209
Medic!

6
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,962
Losing pressure, I need 10ccs...

7
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:24,468
It happened so fast, he was
hit before I could do anything

8
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:26,597
How bad is it?

9
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:27,390
We don't know.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,100
We just don't know.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Please tell me he's not going to Die.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,990
Why should I help you?

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,990
I'm offering you your Freedom, Dina.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,294
You and behrooz will be put in
the witness protection program.

15
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:43,215
You'll be given new Names,
identities, everything.

16
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:45,094
What do you need me to do?

17
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:49,019
I need you to go to fayed and tell
him that you need to speak to marwan.

18
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:53,236
He won't let me through his front door let alone get near marwan.

19
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,033
He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him.

20
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:57,704
Who?

21
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,624
Me.

22
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:01,336
What If rayed doesn't believe us?

23
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:03,299
Then we're both dead.

24
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:04,175
Close the door!

25
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:04,676
Put your Gun over there.

26
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:06,681
Do it!

27
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:09,395
What is it?

28
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,399
A woman named Dina araz came to me.

29
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:12,610
What does she want?

30
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,987
She wants to bring you a hostage.

31
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,117
A ctu agent name Jack bauer.

32
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,503
Caused me a lot of trouble, Mr. Bauer.

33
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,100
kill him.

34
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:37,537
just what I thought.

35
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:38,539
Dina!

36
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,543
No!

37
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:50,480
Meet them at the hotel.

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,990
I'll need his entire flight package, including
clearance and identification codes.

39
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,618
You'll have whatever you need.

40
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,497
Get your things.

41
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:00,501
We got a plane to catch.

42
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,296
Let me talk to my family.

43
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,591
Your family is dead.

44
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,595
And so are you.

45
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,695
Edgar, have you found
any way to locate Jack?

46
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,200
We're trying, but marwan
wasn't stupid, he covered his tracks.

47
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:38,288
Michelle.

48
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:40,000
What do we have, Chloe?

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,213
Local pd found the Van that
Jack and Dina were in.

50
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:42,923
Where?

51
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:46,931
It was abandoned at an industrial warehouse at
the far end of San Fernando road.

52
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,935
Dina's body was in it.

53
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,438
Okay.

54
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,816
Tell local police to look for witnesses.

55
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,820
We need a license Plate, something to follow.

56
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:57,537
Edgar, pull up satellite from 8:45 to 9:00.

57
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:57,912
I'm on it.

58
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,916
All right, everyone, listen up.

59
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,338
Jack bauer is missing.

60
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:06,221
There's a good chance he's being held by our
primary target, Habib marwan.

61
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:12,818
Because we believe marwan is preparing for another domestic
attack today, we need to Pool all our resources to find him.

62
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,115
All comm teams coordinate with Edgar.

63
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,620
Thank you.

64
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:45,720
yes?

65
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,223
There's a problem.

66
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:47,933
What?

67
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,482
I got onto the Base and through both layers of
security using the pilot's Id.

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,115
Just as I was about to do a pre-flight check,
they grounded the plane.

69
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:56,409
Why?

70
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,288
Checking a trouble sensor.

71
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,292
Might have to swap out a defective part.

72
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,100
How long will it take?

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,021
I don't know yet.

74
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,816
Resolve this now.

75
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,820
It's time to earn your money, Mr. Anderson.

76
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,910
Your window of opportunity on
the target closes in an hour.

77
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:20,125
I understand.

78
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,321
Excuse me.

79
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:35,908
Yes, Sir?

80
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,495
You working on the Phoenix?

81
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,916
Yes, Captain, they sent me down from Hawkins.

82
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,127
You taking her up?

83
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,507
That's the plan, what's the ETA on
getting me in the air?

84
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,303
Well, trouble sensor was correct, Sir.

85
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:48,225
There was a hairline fracture in one of your strut pins.

86
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,605
But, uh, replacement won't be in till morning.

87
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,612
is that the only problem, strut pin?

88
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:56,618
Well, yes, Sir, but it would be one Hell of problem when you tried to land.

89
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:59,040
Rear assembly would disintegrate on Impact.

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,422
Only way out would be to Parachute out and Hope
the jet doesn't come down on anyone.

91
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,553
Did you make your report to the chief
mechanical Officer?

92
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,557
I was just about to head over
there right now, Captain.

93
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,647
And then I'm going to head up to Ventura for a little R&amp;R.

94
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,401
Sounds great.

95
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:13,194
Don't let me hold you up.

96
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,198
Thank you, Sir.

97
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,426
Thanks.

98
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:29,019
M.E. Says Dina's been dead
for less than 30 minutes.

99
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:31,440
We can only assume that's when
marwan grabbed Jack.

100
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,530
What's the search Range on
Jack and marwan?

101
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,827
1500 Square miles, but it's
increasing by the minute.

102
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:37,829
What about chatter?

103
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,628
Well, I filtered through everything that came
from Langley, Nsa and interpol.

104
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,633
None of it's correlating right now.

105
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,551
And volume?

106
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:46,221
It's actually slowing down.

107
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,061
Which May mean that we've incurred all
the damage we will today.

108
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,858
Or it could be the calm before the Storm.

109
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,069
Yeah.

110
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,910
The one thing we know for sure is If Jack's
alive, he'll find a way to contact us.

111
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,624
We'll just have to wait until we pick up a thread on marwan.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,004
Yeah.

113
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,138
Tony.

114
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,142
Yup?

115
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,647
I heard Jack called you earlier today.

116
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,737
Yeah.

117
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,741
And that you saved his life?

118
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,833
Well, we both know I owed him one, right?

119
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,643
Look, Audrey's been waiting for her husband
to get out of surgery.

120
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:31,440
I think we should tell her about Jack.

121
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,447
Why?

122
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,825
They're involved.

123
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:37,620
She's married.

124
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,624
Separated.

125
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,422
Well, then I'd prefer not to tell her anything.

126
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,215
Why?

127
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:46,639
Because we May have to make a very tough call
on how Jack's capture plays out.

128
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,225
Well, Michelle, she's a professional.

129
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:49,520
She knows that's a possibility.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,315
I think it'd be wrong to keep it from her.

131
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,111
I don't want her interfering.

132
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,115
I think she has a right to know.

133
00:06:57,745 --> 00:07:00,251
But, Hey, you're the boss, it's your call.

134
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:02,129
excuse me.

135
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,424
How's Paul doing?

136
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,843
He's still in surgery.

137
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,848
I won't know until he gets out.

138
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,937
Have you heard anything from Jack?

139
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,570
Jack is missing.

140
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:15,950
Missing?

141
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,912
We think he was taken by Habib marwan.

142
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:21,002
My God...

143
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,420
What are we doing to get him back?

144
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
everything we can.

145
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,800
How did this happen?

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,140
I thought we were tracking him.

147
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:30,313
He's supposed to be protected.

148
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:32,443
No one is fully protected in the field.

149
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:34,530
Who was in charge of this operation?

150
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,035
I was.

151
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,251
Get him back, Michelle.

152
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,873
I have a few simple questions.

153
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:01,628
If you answer them, there's a chance you
might survive today.

154
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,426
Don't waste your time.

155
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,025
You located me through a man named Joseph fayed, who you might be interested to know has since martyred himself.

156
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:16,242
It would help me If I knew he was the only Link you had to me.

157
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,960
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail.

158
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,132
Just like everything else you've tried today.

159
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,637
Fail?

160
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:30,772
Almost 40 dead in a Train crash, many more near
the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

161
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,071
That wasn't really your plan, was it?

162
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:37,662
We managed to stop the other 103 power
plants from melting down.

163
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:40,459
That's what America will remember,
that we stopped you.

164
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,129
No.

165
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:48,518
They'll remember the image of Secretary of defense heller held hostage on your own soil,and it will Burn in their psyches.

166
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,528
This country will forever be afraid to let their leaders appear in public.

167
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:57,537
For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well.

168
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:05,136
Whatever you throw at us, I promise you, that'll never happen.

169
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,163
Marwan, we have a problem.

170
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,248
What is it?

171
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:21,253
The family of the pilot that we killed.

172
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,171
What about them?

173
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,215
We disposed of the bodies, right?

174
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:27,933
Yes, yes, but a relative showed up at the house and became suspicious when no one was home.

175
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,937
He called the police who are now looking into it.

176
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,733
Has it gotten to ctu yet?

177
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,321
No, but this man was a military pilot.

178
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,537
It will be flagged by other agencies and it
will get to ctu within the hour.

179
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,336
What do you think we should do?

180
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:45,136
We have to make sure ctu is too
busy to realize its significance.

181
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:46,555
Distract them.

182
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:48,559
How?

183
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,754
Tell me about the boy.

184
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:02,881
What boy?

185
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,843
Behrooz araz.

186
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,516
What do you care about him for?

187
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,645
Does ctu have him in custody?

188
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,445
Yes. He's safe.

189
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,662
You answered the question, but
are you telling me the truth?

190
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,251
Call ctu, ask them yourself.

191
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:57,829
Edgar Stiles.

192
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,958
What's the new password for the Server?

193
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,253
For the central Server?

194
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:02,046
I'll get you on.

195
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,551
No, don't get me on. Give me the password so I
can access it whenever I want to.

196
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,555
It's not your area anymore.

197
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,267
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,854
You work for me.

199
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:12,359
No. I worked for you. Worked.
With an -ed at the end. Past tense.

200
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,946
Edgar, I've been reinstated.

201
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:16,159
So quit being territorial and just give me the password.

202
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,163
No.

203
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:36,827
Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar that I have
been re-hired to resume my position as head of comm?

204
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,038
Things have changed, Chloe.

205
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:39,165
Edgar took over for you.

206
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,169
You'll be working for him now.

207
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,259
You're kidding.

208
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,265
Michelle called me in because things were
falling apart here under Edgar.

209
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,770
Now give me my command or I walk.

210
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:54,071
You'll have equal authority, just on Paper it
has to look like you work for him.

211
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,367
Well, I'm not going to do that.
It's a matter of Principle.

212
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:58,789
You'll be bumped up to a term four analyst.

213
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,587
That's a 35% Increase in salary plus bonus.

214
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,964
Well, I should be getting that anyway.

215
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,384
That's not my point.

216
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:05,470
Edgar works for me.

217
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,474
Not today, Chloe.

218
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,522
Fine...

219
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,651
What's the password to the central Server?

220
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:15,157
C-I-s-one-five-a.

221
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:17,161
Thanks.

222
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:18,539
Curtis!

223
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,752
A man who says he's Habib marwan is on line one.

224
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:22,672
He wants to speak to the director of ctu.

225
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:23,758
Put it through a Hi-res filter.

226
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,762
Activate all tracers and recorders.

227
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:29,478
Michelle, someone claiming to be
Habib marwan is on the line.

228
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:30,981
Are you prepped for the call?

229
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:31,357
Yeah.

230
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,361
Take it there.

231
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,664
Put him through.

232
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,670
This is Michelle dessler, director of ctu.

233
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,881
To whom am I speaking?

234
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,593
This is Habib marwan.

235
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:47,182
Jack bauer is alive and in my custody.

236
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:48,476
I'll need to speak to him.

237
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,900
I will return him to you unharmed in exchange for behrooz araz.

238
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,741
I will give you ten minutes to secure clearances with your people.

239
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,662
I need more time before I can agree to that.

240
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,956
Ten minutes.

241
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:03,466
I will call you then with exact details on how the exchange is to proceed.

242
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:06,472
Did you get a Trace?

243
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:06,973
No.

244
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,269
Okay, confirm marwan's identity off voice.

245
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,273
And process behrooz araz.

246
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:11,858
got it.

247
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,280
Why is behrooz araz Worth trading for Jack?

248
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:16,785
I don't know.

249
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:19,081
Have all tactical teams meet
me in the situation room.

250
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,086
Yeah.

251
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:56,284
Sent the report about the pilot and his
missing family to ctu yet?

252
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:57,787
I don't think so.

253
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:00,585
But our contact at lapd said that the report has been flagged.

254
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:03,466
It will go out to all the agencies within the next 15 minutes.

255
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,182
If ctu gets a hold of it, even
a minute too soon, they'll be able to stop us.

256
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:09,770
You need to tell me the second
that report gets released.

257
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,775
Yes, marwan.

258
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:15,741
Marwan wants to exchange
Jack bauer for behrooz araz.

259
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,871
The obvious question is why.

260
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,668
The way I see it, there are two possibilities.

261
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:23,048
One, there's a personal connection.

262
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:26,472
Two, behrooz has information that can damage marwan.

263
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:27,766
I agree.

264
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,772
Edgar, have your team sift through everything we have on behrooz araz.

265
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:34,488
Go back as far as you can and see If there's a family Link between him and marwan.

266
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:40,083
Did the initial interrogation reveal that behrooz knew
anything that might make him valuable to marwan?

267
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,171
No, but main focus was on the mother.

268
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,967
We really didn't push him very hard.

269
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,470
Curtis, push harder.

270
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,973
See what you can find.

271
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:47,975
But do it now.

272
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,772
My guess is marwan will want to make this exchange within the hour.

273
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,405
Tony, monitor him from the observation room.

274
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:55,783
Chloe, what do we have on audio?

275
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:58,246
I was able to get some
voice memos from mclennan-Forster.

276
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,457
The voice print matched.

277
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:00,167
It was marwan's.

278
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,670
How are you going to handle this?

279
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,758
The kid thinks his mother
made a deal to protect him.

280
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,180
The first thing I have to do
is let him think that the deal is off.

281
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,058
We can't use a psychological approach.

282
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:08,768
It's too slow.

283
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:09,854
What are you suggesting?

284
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:13,278
I think he's just going to drag his feet
unless we put some physical pressure on him.

285
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,781
He's just a scared kid.

286
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,785
I'm pretty sure he's given us
everything he knows.

287
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,789
You're pretty sure?

288
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,587
I'll call Richards.

289
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,672
Tony...

290
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,676
Go ahead... I'll catch up.

291
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:27,182
Have you heard anything on Jack?

292
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:29,395
Yeah, we just got some information a couple of minutes ago.

293
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,898
Why didn't you let me know?

294
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,902
I'm sorry, Audrey, but things
are going pretty fast here.

295
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:34,990
Look, Jack's alive.

296
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,701
He is being held by marwan.

297
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,163
How did you confirm that?

298
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,749
Marwan contacted us.

299
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:41,378
He contacted you?

300
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,463
Why would he do that?

301
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,259
He wants to make a trade.

302
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,263
Jack for behrooz.

303
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:48,351
When is that going to happen?

304
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,770
We don't know If it is.

305
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,190
What do you mean?

306
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,488
Look, If he wants to make this trade, that
means behrooz has tactical value.

307
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,994
If that's the case, then we
May have to hold on to him.

308
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,879
Look, there's a lot of stuff we have to go
over before anything happens.

309
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,177
I'll keep you posted, but right now I have to get
in that room with behrooz, all right?

310
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,603
Thank you.

311
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:15,699
All right, keep it at that level.

312
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,912
Let me know If the readings fluctuate.

313
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:30,981
Remember, he doesn't know
that his mother's dead.

314
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:33,069
I know.

315
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,580
Hello, behrooz.

316
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,585
How much longer do I have to stay here?

317
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,090
These things take time.

318
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,676
Where is my mother?

319
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:45,678
She's still in the field.

320
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,599
With Jack bauer?

321
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,601
Is she okay?

322
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:49,603
Yeah.

323
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,607
She's fine.

324
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,916
Tell me about Habib marwan.

325
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,879
Why are you doing this?

326
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:04,969
Habib marwan.

327
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,472
Your mother gave us a little information.

328
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:07,975
She said you could give us some more.

329
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,186
You promised you wouldn't Hurt me!

330
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:11,357
Please, get this Guy away from me.

331
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:12,860
Back over here.

332
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,864
We're just going to have a little talk.

333
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,996
Marwan's the leader.

334
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:18,998
That's all I know.

335
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:21,169
I heard my parents
talk about him, that's it.

336
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,603
Go ahead.

337
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,196
What are you going to do?

338
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:36,994
What is he going to do to me?

339
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:37,912
sorry, behrooz.

340
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:37,996
We just don't have a lot of time.

341
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:42,422
No, no, no!

342
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:45,887
This is marwan.

343
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:47,557
Get me Michelle dessler.

344
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,562
Miss dessler, it's marwan!

345
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:53,486
Everyone, on this!

346
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:00,292
This is dessler.

347
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,797
Union conduit dam, -

348
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:03,507
North entrance. 30 Minutes.

349
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:05,678
I need to know Jack bauer's still alive.

350
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,808
Very well.

351
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:09,812
Michelle dessler wants to
make sure you're alive.

352
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:15,825
I'm being held in an abandoned warehouse, somewhere downtown...

353
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:18,121
Satisfied?

354
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,209
I don't know If I can make this happen in 30 minutes.

355
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,921
You'll find a way.

356
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,925
Wait...

357
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,681
Damn it!

358
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:29,061
Ctu will never go through with the exchange.

359
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:32,902
I'm expendable.

360
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:34,990
Yes. You are.

361
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,288
If behrooz is a value to you,
he's a value to them.

362
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:41,169
They'll never let you have him back.

363
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,330
Marwan.

364
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:01,420
The police report file has been distributed.

365
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,219
In the next few minutes, ctu will be alerted
that a military pilot and his family are missing.

366
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:08,058
All right.

367
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,706
Chloe, the hourlies from lapd are here.

368
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,000
What do you usually do with them?

369
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,006
I go through them and promote
any flagged items to the analysts.

370
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,008
I can't do that now.

371
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,386
I have to get ready for the call from marwan.

372
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:26,514
Well, I can't do it either.

373
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:27,599
I'm working on tracking behrooz.

374
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,186
But I'd get on those
hourlies If I were you.

375
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:30,397
Well, you're not me.

376
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:34,405
I'll hand it off to Meg, tell her to sift through it, and
deal with any flagged items when we're done with the exchange.

377
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:36,493
Okay, boss.

378
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:41,712
this is Meg.

379
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,716
Meg, hourlies from local Law
enforcement just came in.

380
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,303
Chloe and I need you to sift through them.

381
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,931
Do you know how backed up we are down here?

382
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,184
Yeah, well, it's worse up here.

383
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,186
Just do it, okay?

384
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,566
Fine. Send us a four.

385
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:10,898
Phoenix is ready to go.

386
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,401
I thought we were waiting on a part.

387
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:14,196
It's a good thing they called me
in for a second opinion.

388
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:17,119
Aft strut's fine... It was just a
faulty trouble sensor.

389
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,205
You sure?

390
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:19,708
Absolutely, I triple checked it.

391
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,420
It was just a false alarm.

392
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,424
Here is my report.

393
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,192
All right, I'll clear it for take-off.

394
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,791
This is Miller.

395
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,215
Phoenix is clear for take-off all right.

396
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:05,720
Chloe, what's wrong?

397
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:07,223
Nothing.

398
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,021
I mean, there's no bad news about Jack yet,
If that's what you're asking.

399
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:16,576
Since Jack and your father aren't here, you're
the Official dod representative,

400
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,288
so these are
some Standard non-disclosures.

401
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,292
Read them whenever you get a chance.
I flagged where you need to sign.

402
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,589
I'll do that now.

403
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,524
I'm really sorry about your husband.

404
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,695
Thank you.

405
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:37,495
I can't imagine how I'd be feeling
right now If I were you.

406
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,127
I'm feeling like someone who's afraid
of losing her husband.

407
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,633
No, I meant you know, you and your
husband are separated...

408
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,012
And you've fallen in love with Jack, I guess,

409
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:50,313
and then you end up together, and your husband
takes a bullet but saves Jack's life?

410
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:51,524
What do you do with that?

411
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:53,737
I can't think about that right now, Chloe, okay?

412
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,198
I just need Paul to pull through this.

413
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,493
What about Jack?

414
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,288
You just assume the terrorists
aren't going to kill him?

415
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:01,378
Chloe, I don't want to talk about it.

416
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,090
Here.

417
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,094
I was inappropriately Blunt, wasn't I?

418
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,599
I do that a lot.

419
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:12,025
Sorry.

420
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:13,904
Sorry, I'm going to go.

421
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:17,829
I have a... A field meeting anyway.

422
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:30,146
when you said your father spoke to marwan, was
that on the phone or did he come to your house?

423
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,154
Both.

424
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,996
Did you ever speak to marwan alone,
away from your parents?

425
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,002
No.

426
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:44,802
When they made the preparation for today's
attacks, were you in the room?

427
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:47,891
I told you.

428
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,896
They didn't want me in there.

429
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:52,610
Almeida.

430
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,113
Tony, the briefing's about to start.

431
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:56,117
All right, I'll be right there.

432
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,332
If he produces something relevant,

433
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:01,336
let me know. I'll be in the briefing.

434
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:07,808
O'Brian.

435
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:10,814
Chloe, is anything you're doing up there
yielding a military connection?

436
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:12,234
No. Why?

437
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:16,242
It May be nothing, but the county hourly's contain
an incident report that might be Worth looking at.

438
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:17,411
What is it?

439
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:22,505
An air force pilot's wife and kids reported
missing as of two hours ago.

440
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:23,800
Two hours ago?

441
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,595
How can someone be missing
in two hours?

442
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:26,388
I don't know, Chloe.

443
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:28,518
I'm just telling you what it says here.
Should I run it?

444
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:29,896
No, we have to do it up here.

445
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:32,109
Then why did you send it down here
in the first place?

446
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,324
It was Edgar's executive decision.

447
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:36,326
Should I give it to you?

448
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:38,622
No, I'm the primary tactical
in a trade for Jack.

449
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:39,624
Give it to Edgar.

450
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:41,628
He said he's too busy.

451
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,134
Just run it through county and get it to him.

452
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:46,138
Okay.

453
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:00,209
Edgar

454
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:00,710
What?

455
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,004
Meg found something in the hourly.

456
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:03,090
I need you to look at it.

457
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,303
Can't Meg do it?

458
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,305
I'm preparing for this briefing.

459
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,100
No, it's the job of the lead tactical.

460
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,021
Isn't that what you think you are?

461
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,524
I don't need your sarcasm, okay?

462
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:12,526
I'll take care of it.

463
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,530
Fantastic.

464
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,010
Hey. Is this briefing about the trade for Jack?

465
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,848
Yeah. Marwan us called again.

466
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:29,019
Has a decision been made
whether to go through with it or not?

467
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,649
- No. That's going to be decided in this meeting.
- By whom

468
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:32,526
Division.

469
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,822
Look, they sent someone down to run point.

470
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,035
Is Division thinking about not going through with this exchange?

471
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,624
Honestly, it could go either way.

472
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:46,012
Look, I don't need to tell you that Jack would want
us to do what's best for the operation and the country, not what's best for him.

473
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,516
I know.

474
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:49,228
All right. I'll let you know what's going on as soon as I can.

475
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:51,232
All right. Thanks, Tony.

476
00:24:54,614 --> 00:24:56,701
Were you able to get
anything out of behrooz?

477
00:24:56,701 --> 00:25:01,545
I don't think he knows anything
but Curtis is still trying.

478
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:02,213
Okay.

479
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,217
Bill,

480
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:05,136
are we up to speed?

481
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,140
Yeah, I got briefed on the way here.

482
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:09,353
All right, everyone, listen up.

483
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:11,733
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.

484
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,319
He'll be overseeing the operation.

485
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,449
All department heads run everything through him.

486
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:16,242
Bill.

487
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:20,960
In less than half an hour, Habib marwan wants to
make an exchange at the Union conduit dam;

488
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,923
behrooz araz for Jack bauer.

489
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,511
Now, before we decide whether or not to go
forward,

490
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:27,516
I need to know a few things.

491
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,812
Why does marwan want the boy?

492
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:31,524
What's his value?

493
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:34,822
We were unable to find any evidence that
behrooz had any critical information.

494
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:35,741
Did you push him?

495
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:36,910
Yeah.

496
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,205
I don't think the kid knows anything.

497
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,207
Who's doing backgrounds?

498
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:39,708
Me.

499
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,213
There's nothing that specifically ties
these two people together.

500
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:43,716
The parents, yes, behrooz, no.

501
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:46,430
Could behrooz have had something implanted in his body, -

502
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,017
something neither he or his
parents knew about?

503
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:48,852
No.

504
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,355
We had him scanned when
he was brought in.

505
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:51,357
Did you do an mri?

506
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:53,361
Yeah.

507
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:57,035
I don't like giving something up
unless I know its value.

508
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,749
Let's talk about what happens
If we don't agree to the exchange.

509
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,545
We don't get Jack bauer
back, for one thing.

510
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:03,298
That can't be the
deciding Factor here.

511
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,092
Well, most importantly, -

512
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:07,724
If we don't go through with this exchange, we
May be lose an opportunity to trap marwan.

513
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,812
Marwan has to know that's
what we're thinking.

514
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:13,820
The chances of him actually
being in prison at the exchange are small.

515
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,326
I agree, but we could put a tracer on behrooz.

516
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,745
He might lead us to marwan.

517
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,916
You tried to Trace Dina araz
and Jack an hour ago.

518
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,046
They grabbed Jack and killed Dina.

519
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,215
We'll take a different approach.

520
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,635
Use tracers, two of them.

521
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,931
One for marwan to find,
the other subcutaneous.

522
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:29,228
There's no guarantee he
won't find that one, too.

523
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:31,649
No, Sir, there are no guarantees, period.

524
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:34,447
But the fact is we have
no viable leads on marwan.

525
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,743
We have to run with
every chance we get.

526
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:42,463
Have tactical finish up the
profiles in five minutes.

527
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:45,261
Let's get field teams on
their way to the dam now.

528
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,806
How do you want to approach the site?

529
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:50,230
We'll figure that out when marwan calls
back with the details of the exchange.

530
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,610
Go.

531
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:02,714
yeah.

532
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:04,134
What's your status?

533
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:06,138
I should be airborne in 30 minutes.

534
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,225
Very well.

535
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,524
Get bauer.

536
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:11,232
No, we have to have the satellite
in position, -

537
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,528
before the exchange takes the place.

538
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,829
Edgar, Chloe wants you to take a
look at this when you have the time.

539
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:20,042
Hang on. Let me write that down.

540
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,127
Just put that down.

541
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:23,131
Thank you.

542
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:25,637
Yeah, okay, got it.

543
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,033
Mrs. Raines?

544
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:39,541
The doctor wanted me to tell you that your husband
should be out of surgery within the next hour.

545
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,752
How's it going?

546
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,338
That's all he said.

547
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:44,342
Thank you.

548
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,480
Audrey, any word on Paul?

549
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,735
We still don't know yet.

550
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:56,033
Look, I thought you'd want to know we
decided to go ahead with the exchange.

551
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,246
We're getting behrooz ready right now.

552
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,334
It's not going to be as simple as that, is it?

553
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:01,628
These things are never simple,-

554
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:03,549
but, uh, -

555
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:06,138
if marwan really wants the kid,
he's got no reason to Hurt Jack.

556
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,058
And If he doesn't, and it's just a trap?

557
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:09,436
We'll be prepared.

558
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:11,566
Our field agents will have
the area fully covered.

559
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,152
Tony, will you be there?

560
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,157
No, I'm going to be
running point from here.

561
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:17,161
Curtis will be on the ground.

562
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:24,175
Is the operational objective to get Jack?

563
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:28,184
No, it isn't.

564
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:35,240
Audrey...

565
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:38,831
We have to consider Jack expendable.

566
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,839
This whole thing's about
creating an exposure point for marwan.

567
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:45,428
I know.

568
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:51,941
Thank you for being straight with me, Tony.

569
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,451
Look...

570
00:29:57,745 --> 00:29:59,749
Jack's about the only friend I have
left, so I'm going to do everything -

571
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:05,052
I can to keep him safe, all right?

572
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,351
Okay.

573
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:26,138
What are you doing?

574
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,142
Where are you taking me?

575
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,731
Habib marwan offered to
exchange one of our operatives for you.

576
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,071
We accepted that offer.

577
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:35,157
What are you talking about?

578
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:36,576
What does he want from me?

579
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:37,745
We don't know.

580
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:40,752
But we'll be behind you every step of the
way, and recover you as soon as possible.

581
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,756
Does my mother know about this?

582
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,887
Yes.

583
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:51,357
You made a deal with her, to put us both in witness protection.

584
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:53,194
And we'll do everything to
abide by that deal.

585
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:55,198
Then don't do this!

586
00:30:55,574 --> 00:30:57,536
That's not an option.

587
00:30:58,455 --> 00:31:00,459
Put this watch on.

588
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:03,340
No.

589
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:06,054
Go away from me.

590
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:08,058
These devices will help us track you.

591
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:11,941
And I give you my word I'll do
everything in my power for you.

592
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:16,868
Hang on, behrooz, this will stick.

593
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:21,044
it's a Micro tracker implanted
under your skin.

594
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,555
You don't care about
me, or your word.

595
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,854
You're just using me!

596
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,783
Let's go.

597
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:43,257
Edgar, I need you to sterilize
a video feed to Curtis's Van.

598
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,259
Tony, I'm stacked up.

599
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,138
I got teams that need tactical uploads.

600
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,850
These hourlies need to be looked at.

601
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,269
They're 30 minutes past due.

602
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,772
And now I got to put video together?

603
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:51,774
Video's a priority.

604
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:52,443
I'll take care of the uploads.

605
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,447
What about the hourlies?

606
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,165
Get on it as soon as the Link's in place.

607
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:09,687
Is that tracker working?

608
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:10,772
The red Dot is the decoy.

609
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:13,987
When they find the watch and remove it, we can
still Trace the tracker in the back of his neck.

610
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:14,697
All right.

611
00:32:14,697 --> 00:32:18,079
Edgar, make sure all cellular stations
in that area are put on auto-Trace.

612
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,248
Got it.

613
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,255
When our vehicles get within two miles
of the dam on the West, have them hold.

614
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,261
Nobody goes into that area
until we hear from marwan again.

615
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:27,140
Castle and his team will be
there as soon as possible.

616
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,058
Behrooz is on his way.

617
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:29,144
The tracer's in place.

618
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:31,941
We don't have time to send in
sweep teams, make sure it's not a trap.

619
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,071
We don't have a choice.

620
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,367
CTU, Edgar Stiles.

621
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,244
This is marwan.

622
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:38,163
Get dessler.

623
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:40,167
Miss dessler, it's marwan.

624
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:46,555
This is dessler.

625
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:48,559
I'm going to give you final
instructions now.

626
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,564
Make sure you follow them explicitly.

627
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:52,192
Are you ready?

628
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:52,693
Go ahead.

629
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,697
How are you transporting behrooz?

630
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,701
In one of our tactical vehicles.

631
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:57,495
Good.

632
00:32:57,495 --> 00:32:58,873
Now...

633
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:00,459
Approach Via the frontage road.

634
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:06,054
Pull up by the back gate of the dam and have behrooz
get out by himself and walk toward the gate.

635
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,641
A Van will be there to pick him up.

636
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,645
What about Jack bauer?

637
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,649
He'll be in the Van.

638
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:14,781
That doesn't work for me.

639
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,952
I want to see Jack before
I give up behrooz.

640
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,248
That's acceptable.

641
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,376
And I want him unharmed.

642
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,380
Your boy scout is just fine.

643
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:23,674
Okay.

644
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:26,555
Remember, behrooz gets out by himself.

645
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:30,397
If any of your agents interfere, bauer dies.

646
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:31,774
Understood.

647
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:33,695
Don't be late.

648
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,365
Our vehicle's five minutes away.

649
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:37,369
Then we'll see you in five minutes.

650
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,587
That should keep them busy.

651
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,549
What do you want to do about bauer?

652
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:46,472
As soon as we have behrooz...

653
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:48,476
We kill bauer.

654
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:31,774
Who's going to protect me?

655
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:33,069
We are.

656
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:35,073
That's why we put trackers on you.

657
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,662
You don't think marwan will find them?

658
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,873
He will.

659
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:40,877
Hopefully, it won't come
to that, behrooz.

660
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,674
What does that mean?

661
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:46,681
We're gonna have the area surrounded.

662
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,476
We will protect you.

663
00:34:48,476 --> 00:34:50,397
Why would you protect me?

664
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:51,900
I'm nothing to you people.

665
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,904
You think I'm a terrorist.

666
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,785
I don't believe you are.

667
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,002
If marwan is going to be there, -

668
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:03,716
why don't you just grab
him when we get there?

669
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,720
He's probably not going to be there.

670
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,766
We needyou to lead us to him.

671
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:10,271
Oh, God.

672
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:11,148
It's going to be all right.

673
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:13,152
It's not!

674
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:20,584
I'm in position.

675
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:22,589
Does ctu have anyone there yet?

676
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:25,678
No, but Rashid has spotted vehicles
at the edge of the access road.

677
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:27,683
He thinks that it might be them.

678
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:28,685
Okay.

679
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,564
Wait until the exchange.

680
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,568
Then I'll give you the word to take out bauer.

681
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:34,697
All right

682
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:38,580
Once the trade is made, how much longer
do we need to keep ctu distracted?

683
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:41,587
Ideally, until we hit the target.

684
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:43,215
In any event, as long as possible.

685
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:45,595
And what should my men do with
behrooz once we have him?

686
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:49,854
I haven't decided yet.

687
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:21,879
yes.

688
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,881
They're here.

689
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,008
Good.

690
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:25,804
Send in the Van.

691
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:27,098
I don't want to do this.

692
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:27,891
Please. I'm afraid.

693
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:30,564
I told you, behrooz, we'll be
behind you every step of the way.

694
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,276
What good will that do If
he wants me dead?

695
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,572
He's not going through all of this just
so that he can kill you.

696
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:47,098
All right, the Van's here.

697
00:36:58,288 --> 00:37:00,292
Come on.

698
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:04,301
All right, I see Jack.

699
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:05,595
This might be all we're gonna get.

700
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:06,806
We could converge on them now.

701
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:07,891
Edgar.

702
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:11,106
Is there any indication that marwan has
other personnel or vehicles in the area?

703
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,069
No. Just a Van.

704
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:16,785
Marwan's not gonna be there.

705
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:20,376
If we close in now, they could take
the Van out themselves.

706
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:23,465
We proceed.

707
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,094
Curtis, it's a go.

708
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:26,179
All right.

709
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:28,184
I'm sending behrooz.

710
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:30,271
Go ahead

711
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:32,276
It's all right.

712
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,994
Go.

713
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:01,086
Is my mother in the Van?

714
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:02,589
She was working with
you. Where is she?

715
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:03,173
I don't know.

716
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:05,177
I don't want to Die.

717
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:11,399
We've got behrooz, and I've
got bauer in my sights.

718
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:13,779
Take him out.

719
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:24,384
I got their sniper.

720
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:26,388
Let's move out.

721
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,232
Why'd you give them the kid?

722
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,234
It's okay. He's been double-tagged.

723
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:33,904
We're tracking him.

724
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:36,159
All right, you two, secure the area.

725
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:38,580
You two, let's go.

726
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:50,104
Almeida.

727
00:38:50,104 --> 00:38:51,399
Tony, it's Jack.

728
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,902
I got Buchanan and Michelle here.

729
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:53,904
I'm putting you on speaker.

730
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:54,906
Okay.

731
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:55,491
You okay?

732
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:56,117
Yeah, I'm fine.

733
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:59,916
Look, Tony, I need you to pick up a phone
matrix within a 20-Mile radius of the dam.

734
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,710
What are you thinking?

735
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,800
I managed to short-circuit some phone lines
in the building that I was being held.

736
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:09,311
Look, If you can find two Service obstructions
at the same coordinates, we can get to marwan.

737
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:11,524
I'm opening up an interface with
the phone company right now.

738
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:12,818
Tony, we don't have a lot of time.

739
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,825
Marwan was at the building when they moved
me, but he's not gonna stay there long.

740
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,578
We have tactical teams ready to go.

741
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:19,499
Once we get a location, I'll reposition
for an assault.

742
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:20,668
Okay, I know the layout.

743
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:21,378
I'll run point.

744
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:23,382
Copy that.

745
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,094
The Van's heading West on center.

746
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:26,889
Both trackers are registering so far.

747
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:27,599
Good.

748
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,810
Let me know If anything changes.

749
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,814
Okay, I will.

750
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:36,618
Marwan.

751
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:37,411
We have the boy.

752
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:40,083
I know they will have placed tracking
devices on him.

753
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,420
Find them.

754
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,006
We're looking for them now.

755
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,010
When you've destroyed them,
report back to me.

756
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,516
Very well.

757
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:56,033
where is my mother?

758
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,996
Your mother is dead.

759
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,296
No.

760
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,593
I don't believe you.

761
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:18,914
what are you going to do to me?

762
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:20,919
No! No!

763
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:26,221
Curtis.

764
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:27,098
We lost one of the tags.

765
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,309
They found the decoy.

766
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:29,812
How's the injected device looking?

767
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,816
Still tracking.

768
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:34,321
Wait.

769
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:36,326
No, it's not.

770
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,539
They must have found it.

771
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:40,793
Damn it. Can you get me a visual on the Van?

772
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:42,797
Hold on.

773
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,108
yeah, Chloe.

774
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:54,321
We need a satellite plugged
into the tactical Server.

775
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:55,992
Chloe, I got something you should see.

776
00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:56,785
Okay, I'll get to it.

777
00:40:56,785 --> 00:41:00,501
Right now we need that satellite to
find behrooz araz before they kill him.

778
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,630
I'm on it.

779
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:33,987
We have a location from the phone company.

780
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:36,701
I repeat, we have the location
where marwan was holding Jack.

781
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,290
Edgar, download these coordinates
to tactical right now.

782
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:44,718
Our window is closing.

783
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:46,806
we will only have this one opportunity.

784
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:48,726
You got to get it into the air right now.

785
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:49,520
No problem.

786
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,524
I am ready and on the move.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
