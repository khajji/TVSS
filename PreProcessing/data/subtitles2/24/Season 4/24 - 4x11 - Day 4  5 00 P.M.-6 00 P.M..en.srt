Previously On 24

6
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:13,889
You're not my son.

7
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:14,806
Why?

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,236
Because I don't want to
kill innocent people?

9
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:18,293
Because you're weak

10
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:20,407
and you stand for nothing!

11
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:22,106
Is there a problem, Navi?

12
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,165
Government agents have arrested Dina
and surrounded the building that I'm in.

13
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,314
How much more time do you need to melt
down the remaining nuclear power plants?

14
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:29,752
One hour, maybe two.

15
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,831
I don't want to have
to kill you, but I will.

16
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,522
I have a suspect in custody.

17
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:34,343
I need assistance.

18
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,852
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son
back to CTU and head up the interrogation.

19
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:44,990
Wait a second, Jack.

20
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,655
They're not going to let me set
foot in CTU, even if I wanted to.

21
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,029
If I press hard enough

22
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,812
I can get you reinstated, but I need
to know now: Is that what you want?

23
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,227
Ms. Driscoll, I'm sure you're
aware of my history here.

24
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:54,952
Not an issue.

25
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,342
Jack Bauer and secretary
Heller both vouch for you.

26
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,187
That's enough for me.

27
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,559
Did Powell worked directly
for the terrorists?

28
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,380
I told you, I don't know.

29
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,777
I need names, people who
can get us to the override.

30
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,703
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

31
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,547
What, you think this is some kind of trap?

32
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:11,097
Yes.
I do.

33
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:12,417
I didn't give him anything.

34
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:12,852
I...

35
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:17,001
What does CTU know
about the override?

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,234
Audrey, it's me.

37
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,193
Hey, did you find anything at the address?

38
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:29,184
Yeah, the company that owns the building,
it's called galaxy financial services.

39
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,004
Have you ever heard of them?

40
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:30,881
No, should I have?

41
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,381
Your husband's the chief financial officer.

42
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,389
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:35,474
What's really going on?

44
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,524
Are you spying on me?

45
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:38,353
Are you doing something worth spying on?

46
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,179
What is that supposed to mean?!

47
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:41,961
Take your hands off of her!

48
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,443
You set me up!

49
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,313
Put your hands on your head now!

50
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,086
What do you want?

51
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:50,533
I want some answers.

52
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:57,040
The following takes place
between 5:00 p. m. and 6:00 p. m.

53
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,690
I think it would be better if you left
the room while I question your husband.

54
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,135
You can wait just outside
with the backup team.

55
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,206
What are you going to do to him?

56
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:18,852
Whatever I have to.

57
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:22,629
I'm staying.

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,479
Fine.

59
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:03,231
Look at me, Paul.

60
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:05,582
Look at me!

61
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,319
I've got nothing to say to you.

62
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,044
This is what you need to know, Paul.

63
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,690
There are five nuclear power
plants ready to melt down.

64
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,673
All I care about right now is
making sure that that doesn't happen.

65
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,101
Your name is on a lease
in a building in chatsworth

66
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,500
that was used by the terrorists
to plan today's attack.

67
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:21,256
That makes you a prime suspect.

68
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:22,371
I'm going to treat you like one.

69
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,183
Do you understand that?

70
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,061
My name is on at least 50 different leases.

71
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:28,403
I own ten different corporations.

72
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,689
I don't know anything about
some building in chatsworth.

73
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:31,616
I don't believe you.

74
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:34,818
The lease of that building was notarized.

75
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,373
There's documentation of your id.

76
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,129
Ctu verified your signature.

77
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,800
Paul, you need to start talking to me now.

78
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,374
I've got nothing to say to you.

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:58,467
Jack.

80
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,977
I don't think that Paul would
be a traitor to this country.

81
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,841
Right now Paul is a prime suspect,

82
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:08,046
and he's not cooperating with me and I
don't have time to do this any other way.

83
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,335
I need to know for sure.

84
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:13,452
Paul...

85
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:17,869
this is the last chance you've got to
talk to me before I have to hurt you.

86
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,647
Tell me about 24878 alvert
street in chatsworth.

87
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:23,611
Why's your name on the lease?

88
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,256
Jack, please.

89
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,568
Audrey, don't interfere!

90
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,929
If you need to step
outside of this room, do it.

91
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,097
Why is your name on the lease?

92
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,504
You're bluffing.

93
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:51,546
I need that information,
Paul, I need it now.

94
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:55,979
Come on, Paul, just tell me.

95
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,313
What's your connection to the terrorists?

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,862
Jack?

97
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,682
Please, don'T.

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,721
All right, all right, all right.

99
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,732
I-I-I don't know the specific
building you're talking about.

100
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,217
I can find out.

101
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:25,859
How?!

102
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,547
My corporate records
are stored on my laptop.

103
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:32,092
If that address is under
my name then it'll come up.

104
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:34,389
Maybe there's someone else
involved I don't know about.

105
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,103
What's your user id log-in number?

106
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,056
It'll be much quicker if I just do it.

107
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:41,789
Please.

108
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:59,693
You want me to believe that you're
not involved with this, Paul?

109
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,874
You better show me who is.

110
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:28,193
I'm sorry I had to call you
here, Marwan, but I had no choice.

111
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:32,851
Ctu is trying to disable the
override, using a drinfeld module.

112
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:35,592
They've already shut down over 90 reactors.

113
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,705
We always knew they'd stop some of them.

114
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:41,272
The important thing is that one
of the reactors has melted down.

115
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,423
As long as the override has control of the
other five, I can do the rest from here.

116
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,829
Everything is ready for you upstairs.

117
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,204
Will anyone in that office be suspicious?

118
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,121
I've reported a system failure.

119
00:06:57,156 --> 00:07:01,159
If anyone asks, tell them you're
from it restoring my hard drive.

120
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:05,302
My desk is in the last row,
three from the end, seat 86.

121
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,692
The override is well
disguised inside the desk.

122
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,539
Here is the key.

123
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:09,520
Good.

124
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,595
How much time will you need?

125
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,751
45 minutes to melt down
the remaining reactors.

126
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,026
I'm here if you need anything.

127
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,345
Where is the CTU agent?

128
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,689
Forbes is questioning him now.

129
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:15,241
He's out.

130
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,698
He's not going to tell us anything.

131
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,282
What does Marwan want us to do with him?

132
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,393
Finish him off.

133
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,066
Then get rid of the body.

134
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,121
Take care of it.

135
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:31,617
He came with a woman and two other agents.

136
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:32,705
Where are their bodies?

137
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:33,521
They're already in the van.

138
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,321
Yeah, here it is.

139
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,059
Galaxy financial services.

140
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,363
What kind of a company is it?

141
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:44,143
It's, um, a failing payroll
service I was about to dissolve,

142
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:47,311
and someone came in with an
offer to buy 51% of the shares.

143
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,964
Seven, 800 grand, something like that.

144
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:52,443
Here- Harris Barnes, director.

145
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:53,393
Who is Harris Barnes?

146
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,335
I, uh... don't remember.

147
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,488
What do you mean you don't remember?

148
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,423
I'm involved with over 30 companies.

149
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,195
I don't deal directly with most of them.

150
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,468
Explain to me, Paul, how
your name got on the lease.

151
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:06,165
I don't know.

152
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,009
You expect me to believe that
you entered into a business deal

153
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:11,960
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
with someone that you'd never met?

154
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,949
Yes. My attorney handles most of the...

155
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,202
Paul, I don't believe you!

156
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:16,335
Jack, it's possible.

157
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:19,192
Paul has put together a lot
of deals through his attorneys.

158
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:33,454
This is Sarah.

159
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:34,327
Hey, it's me.

160
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,012
I need you to run a name for me.

161
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:36,723
Go ahead.

162
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:37,838
Harris Barnes.

163
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:41,492
He's the director of a cAlifornia
corporation- galaxy financial services.

164
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:42,748
What am I looking for?

165
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,058
Where he lives, his
businesses, anything that

166
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,217
could possibly connect
with any terrorist activity.

167
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,787
All right, give me a minute.

168
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:49,881
I'll be here.

169
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,383
She's calling me right back.

170
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:54,688
Excuse me.

171
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:59,920
Oh, your boyfriend is
just a thug with a badge.

172
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,421
Paul, why is your name on that lease?

173
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,232
Unbelievable.

174
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:09,277
An hour ago, I was sitting here feeling

175
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,479
sorry for myself that
you didn't want me back.

176
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,050
And now... you think I'm a terrorist?

177
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:20,915
You think I had something to do with
you and your father's kidnapping?

178
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,640
I don't know what to believe anymore.

179
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,451
Yeah?

180
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,221
Okay, I ran down the
name Harris Barnes, and

181
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:35,329
a lot of data came up,
but it was inconsistent.

182
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:37,888
So I went into the irs records
and found out that Harris

183
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,186
Barnes didn't appear on their
logs until two years ago.

184
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,410
So it's an Alias.

185
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,770
As far as I can tell it's
a washed id, with a vAlid

186
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,791
social security number
and credit card history.

187
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,068
Interpol back-traced a
name and provided a list

188
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,002
of foreign nationals
who've used it in the past.

189
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,346
Who used it most recently?

190
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,185
A man named Habib Marwan.

191
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:55,607
Okay, we need to find him.

192
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,995
I think we already have.

193
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:57,752
What do you mean?

194
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,383
Marwan used the name Harris Barnes to
lease more office space here in L.A.

195
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:05,108
It turns out the same address was given
to us an hour ago by Marianne Taylor.

196
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,957
She and Curtis are there now.

197
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:08,193
What's the address?

198
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,111
It's the 29th floor at the
Rockland building downtown.

199
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:12,119
Okay, I'm on my way.

200
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,286
As soon as Curtis calls,
you patch him through to me.

201
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:14,815
You got it.

202
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,534
You think Marwan's there?

203
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,615
Right now, it's our only lead.

204
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,785
If he is, that's where the override is.

205
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,187
I'll get back to you.

206
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,545
I want you to tell me
who's still out there.

207
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,648
I want the name of anyone
who can help us find

208
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,849
that override to stop the
plants from melting down.

209
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:47,660
My husband kept all of this from me.

210
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:48,721
I only helped.

211
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:49,890
That's a bunch of crap.

212
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,662
Now, we know you were just
as involved as your husband.

213
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,208
Listen, we're quite
aware that the only reason

214
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,821
you're helping us is
because of your son.

215
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:03,005
But believe me, it's not too late for us
to change our minds about how we treat him.

216
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:13,329
There are a few men whose
names I heard Navi mention.

217
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,878
They might know what you want.

218
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,153
But I don't know how to find them.

219
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:25,527
All right.

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,189
Why don't you start by
writing the names down?

221
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,270
As far as we can tell, this Habib
Marwan's been controlling the override.

222
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,209
Jack's on his way there now?

223
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:44,198
Yes.

224
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,487
Curtis and his team are
already at that building.

225
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:49,232
I know, but we haven't been able
to reach him or his team members.

226
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,554
He's not answEring his cell.

227
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:52,712
How far is Jack?

228
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,032
About 15 minutes out.

229
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,362
Keep trying Curtis.

230
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:56,524
Tell him Jack's on the way.

231
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:59,147
We have to coorDinate the
two and find that override.

232
00:13:59,278 --> 00:13:59,723
Okay.

233
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,121
Tony?

234
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,653
Ask her about a man named Habib Marwan.

235
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:13,474
Who's Habib Marwan?

236
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:21,199
I heard Navi speak of him a few times.

237
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:22,855
He's an engineer.

238
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,445
Beyond that, I don't know.

239
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,297
Miss Driscoll?

240
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,137
Yes?

241
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,026
This is Alison Lackey at the clinic.

242
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,287
There's a problem with your daughter Maya.

243
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,643
I think you should get down
here as soon as you can.

244
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:47,229
I'll be right there.

245
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:48,167
Thank you.

246
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,612
It's the CTU agent's phone.

247
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:01,480
What should we do?

248
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:02,636
Nothing.

249
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,686
Let them wonder where he is.

250
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,569
By the time they reAlize what's
happened, it will be too late.

251
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,982
Find out if Adam and Jason
have disposed of the body.

252
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,515
They should have been back by now.

253
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,233
All right.

254
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,629
Yeah?

255
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,112
Ali, Adam and Jason are dead.

256
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,934
Did the agent escape?

257
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,731
No, the door's still armed.

258
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,233
He's still on this floor.

259
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:55,842
- Find him.
- Yeah.

260
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:04,386
Yes.

261
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,462
The CTU agent is loose on this floor.

262
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:07,821
How did he escape?

263
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,228
He killed two of our men.

264
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,286
Does he know the override
is in the building?

265
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,078
I don't think so, and he can't get to it.

266
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:14,516
We have the exits covered.

267
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,080
Disconnect all the hotlines.

268
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:17,880
He can't be allowed to contact CTU.

269
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:18,761
I will.

270
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:32,496
No, no, no.

271
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:34,057
You can't keep me here!

272
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:35,907
Maya, please.

273
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:37,586
We just want to help you feel better!

274
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,793
I'll feel better when
you get out of my face!

275
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:40,360
Maya!

276
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,546
What took you so long?

277
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,261
I thought she was given a sedative.

278
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:44,728
We did.

279
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:45,649
She's fighting it.

280
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:46,947
Give me a few minutes with her.

281
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:47,493
Sure.

282
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:48,608
Nurse.

283
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:49,200
Honey.

284
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,348
Honey... I brought you here
so that you could be near me.

285
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,219
Isn't that what you wanted?

286
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,056
I want for us to go home.

287
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:00,605
Maya, we will, honey, but
we can't just yet, honey.

288
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,871
I don't like these people here.

289
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:08,535
Maya, Maya, that's not going
to make you feel better.

290
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:10,432
You're wrong.

291
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:11,894
I do feel better.

292
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,577
- Sweetheart, I need you to...
- Go, get out!

293
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:22,507
You're such an important person, why don't
you take care of your important business?

294
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,356
- Maya...
- Doctor?

295
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,098
Doctor?!

296
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:28,064
Doctor?

297
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:29,421
Yes, Maya?

298
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:32,439
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,464
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,408
I was misbehaving.

301
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,233
But I promise to be good.

302
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:43,021
If you'll just get that out of here.

303
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:48,869
I'm going.

304
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:55,479
I'm going.

305
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,200
Bye.

306
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,581
I'll be in my office if you need me.

307
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:07,042
Come on, Maya.

308
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,218
Curtis's phone is ringing,
and he's not answEring it?

309
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:13,677
Right.

310
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,067
It rang several times
before I got his message.

311
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,682
If he had turned it off, it would
have gone to voice mail immediately.

312
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:19,617
He's in trouble.

313
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:20,626
Where are the field teams?

314
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,624
Castle and his men will
be there in two minutes.

315
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,693
I can have them set
up a staging area along

316
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:26,437
the perimeter and stand
by for your command.

317
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,025
What's the probability that
Marwan's even in the facility?

318
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:29,861
We don't know yet.

319
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:31,795
Where are they staging?

320
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,902
They'll be waiting for
you in a parking lot at the

321
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,951
northwest corner of wilshire
and grand, one block away.

322
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:36,476
Okay.

323
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,040
Have your people found Marwan yet?

324
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:39,592
No.

325
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,275
Audrey, you, you have to
know that I would never

326
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,547
be involved in anything
that could bring you harm.

327
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,352
Of all the people this Marwan could
approach to do business and he chose you?

328
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:52,870
It's a hell of a coincidence, Paul.

329
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,026
It might not just be a coincidence.

330
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,146
They might have wanted Paul for
more than just the corporate shell.

331
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:00,426
He chose Paul because he was my husband?

332
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,040
That would put them one degree
of separation from your father.

333
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,561
So this Marwan used me
to get to Audrey's father.

334
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:08,045
It's a possibility.

335
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:11,388
Well, I had no idea where Audrey
or her father would be today.

336
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:14,216
The information they used to stage the
kidnapping couldn't have come from me.

337
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,925
They would have used your relationship
with her father for something else.

338
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,163
Maybe to plan something for
the future, a contingency plan.

339
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,114
I've been careless.

340
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,190
I'm so sorry.

341
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:58,493
all right, well, so far
every name Dina's given

342
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:00,446
us has checked out as
a mid-level cell member.

343
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:05,577
But what's interesting is that Marwan,
who she claims to have never met,

344
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:07,414
is connected to everyone on this list.

345
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,643
It looks like all roads lead to him.

346
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:12,502
This must be his operation.

347
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,709
Which means she definitely
knows more than she's telling us.

348
00:20:16,602 --> 00:20:17,873
What do you want to do to make her talk?

349
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,302
I just need you to give
me a little bit of rope.

350
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:23,412
Do it.

351
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:39,154
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan?

352
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,355
I already told you.

353
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:44,609
No, you told me you never met him.

354
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:45,292
I haven'T.

355
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,000
Danny, could you come in here, please?

356
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:03,140
I'm going to need all video and audio
monitoring in this room disconnected.

357
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:04,685
Thank you.

358
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,575
I'm not a stupid woman.

359
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,491
What are you trying to prove with this?

360
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,012
I'm not trying to prove anything.

361
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:20,349
I just don't want what I'm
about to say to be recorded.

362
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,227
I don't believe you.

363
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,495
Open the door!

364
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:51,944
Everybody out.

365
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:53,246
Get out, now!

366
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:56,950
Everyone, Erin.

367
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,374
Unless you tell me the
whole truth right now,

368
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,506
that deal you made to
save your son is over!

369
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,543
And he goes to prison
for murder and treason!

370
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:21,661
You can't do that.

371
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:23,771
The president signed an agreement.

372
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:25,704
If that deal gets in the way
of protecting this country,

373
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:27,391
you think the president's
gonna stand behind it?

374
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,596
He's gonna tear it up, and your son
goes to prison for the rest of his life.

375
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,330
Let me tell you, I know a
little something about prison.

376
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:38,382
And based on the conditions of his
confinement, I can tell you right now,

377
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,883
I give behrooz about three
months before he commits suicide.

378
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:42,991
And by the way,

379
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:47,457
I'm going to make it my
personal mission to make sure

380
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,164
you never hear word one about
what happens to him, ever!

381
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:06,402
Wait.

382
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:14,254
Habib Marwan is the man our cell
reported to in the united states.

383
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:15,691
You said "your cell. "

384
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,189
How many other cells reported to him?

385
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,341
I don't know.

386
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:20,570
But there are others?

387
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:22,767
Yes.

388
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:23,402
How many?

389
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,441
I told you, I don't know.

390
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,319
The cells are not in
contact with one another.

391
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,910
Marwan thought it was safer that way.

392
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:32,775
What about the override?

393
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:34,795
Is it in his possession right now?

394
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:36,058
Definitely.

395
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:36,757
Definitely?

396
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:37,421
Why definitely?

397
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:41,685
Your programmers are trying to
interfere with the meltdown sequence.

398
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:45,045
Marwan is the only one
capable of stopping them.

399
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:47,582
And he's trying to do this
by controlling it directly?

400
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:48,508
Exactly.

401
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:49,149
Where?

402
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:50,843
Where?!

403
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,801
Somewhere in downtown.

404
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:54,894
The rocklyn building?

405
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:57,923
Yes.

406
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:02,972
Sarah Gavin.

407
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,820
Sarah, get me Jack Bauer on the phone.

408
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:05,493
You got it.

409
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:12,563
Place her back in holding.

410
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,710
Erin, Dina just confirmed
Marwan's got the override.

411
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,820
He's at the rocklyn building.

412
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:19,669
Everyone, listen up!

413
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:23,914
The address where Curtis is
and where Jack Bauer is heading,

414
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:25,691
is the location of the override.

415
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,702
I want every station to
focus on this location.

416
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:30,289
I want field teams ready.

417
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:34,556
Rework your assault tactics on the
building factoring in this new information.

418
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:36,816
Let me speak to Tony.

419
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,901
Hold on a second.

420
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:38,576
Tony.

421
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:39,460
I've got Jack.

422
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:42,537
Jack.

423
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:43,252
Yeah?

424
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,091
We have confirmation: Habib
Marwan is controlling the override.

425
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:47,187
He's at the address you're headed to.

426
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:48,062
What about Curtis?

427
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,233
No, we haven't been able to reach him yet.

428
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:52,763
Have you changed the assault profiles?

429
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:53,791
We're working on it.

430
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:55,209
Look, Marwan's the key to this.

431
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,460
He can't know we're coming or
he'll take off with the override.

432
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:58,758
Also, we're running out of time.

433
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:00,975
We've got about 20 minutes before
these plants start to melt down.

434
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:03,565
Okay, tell Castle to prep
for a low-profile assault.

435
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,682
Tell him I'm on my way.

436
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:05,324
Copy that.

437
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:06,601
Get me Castle.

438
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:11,979
Ali?

439
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:13,872
Go.

440
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:16,705
Have you found him yet?

441
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,138
Marwan, it was not necessary
for you to come down.

442
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:20,528
Not necessary?

443
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:22,377
We will find him.

444
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:25,688
If I'm captured, it'll end
everything we've been working for.

445
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:26,654
We control the floor.

446
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:27,551
He can't get far.

447
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,015
Don't tell me what he can't do.

448
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,444
He's already killed two of our men.

449
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:34,407
What is it, Forbes?

450
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:37,000
Tell me you've got him.

451
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,316
No, I'm sorry, Marwan.

452
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:39,617
He may have gotten away.

453
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:41,145
How is that possible?

454
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,972
Ali says the floor is locked off.

455
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:43,406
I know.

456
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,504
We're still searching.

457
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:48,590
But we've got to deal with
ventilation, air ducts, ceiling space...

458
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:52,418
I don't care how you get him,
as long as he's contained.

459
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:53,975
I need 30 minutes.

460
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,149
Can you make that happen?

461
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,421
I can make it happen.

462
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,290
30 minutes.

463
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,548
Who's Marwan?

464
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:11,914
Who is he?

465
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,474
Does he have the override?

466
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,871
Does he have the override?

467
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:24,443
Yes.

468
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:25,958
Where is he?

469
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:29,535
Where is he?

470
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:31,502
One flight up.

471
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:33,991
I don't have access to the floor.

472
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:53,926
Ctu Sarah Gavin.

473
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,125
Sarah, it's Curtis.

474
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,024
Where's Driscoll?

475
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,915
Where have you been?

476
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,899
We've been trying to reach you.

477
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,140
I'm still in the rocklyn building.

478
00:26:59,251 --> 00:26:59,865
Sarah, listen.

479
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:02,747
Maryanne's dead, I'm sure our
backup teams are dead, too.

480
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:04,699
The override is here.

481
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,277
Uh, Jack's on his way to you now.

482
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:23,604
Jack?

483
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:26,497
I need you to put together a security
detail for Paul and Audrey Raines now.

484
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:27,226
I'll take care of it.

485
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:30,599
I want you to stay here with
these men until I get back.

486
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:31,337
Are you going in?

487
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:31,937
Yeah.

488
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,748
One second.

489
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:36,948
This is Bauer.

490
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:38,635
Jack, it's manning.

491
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:39,611
Where are you?

492
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:41,478
I'm still in the building- 29th floor.

493
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,296
Where are you?

494
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,288
I'm in the staging area about a block away.

495
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:46,105
Have you secured the override device?

496
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:47,956
No, but it's here, on an upper floor.

497
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,763
A man named Marwan is in control.

498
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:51,694
I know, CTU worked up a partial profile.

499
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:52,627
What's your mobility?

500
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:53,250
Limited.

501
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:53,917
They're still looking for me.

502
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,158
But I took an access card
off one of the hostiles.

503
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:57,032
How do we meet?

504
00:27:57,446 --> 00:27:58,532
Take the main elevator.

505
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,918
There's only one guard posted there.

506
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:01,010
I'll take care of him.

507
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,826
I'm on my way.

508
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,580
We've got Marwan boxed in.

509
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,893
I want you to send in your
team, reinforce the perimeter.

510
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:08,171
I want men on the first floor
in case this thing goes hot.

511
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:08,765
Got it.

512
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:23,961
I'll be right back.

513
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:27,600
Go, go!

514
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:42,758
That was our field agents
from the rocklyn building.

515
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:43,672
Your daughter's with them now.

516
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:44,316
She's safe.

517
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,193
I don't want her anywhere near harm's way.

518
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:48,073
She won't be, sir.

519
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,694
I understand we're
closing in on the override?

520
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:05,136
We hope so, sir.

521
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:07,742
We believe we've found
where the terrorists have it.

522
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,370
Which is where?

523
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,329
In an office building in L.A.

524
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:13,551
We believe the terrorists are either
associated with one of the tenants,

525
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:16,196
or they've created a corporation
they're hiding behind.

526
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:17,833
How is CTU proceeding?

527
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:19,122
We have teams converging.

528
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:24,208
Once we find the override, we have to
use it to reprogram the reactors manually.

529
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:26,009
Will there be enough time to reprogram?

530
00:29:26,204 --> 00:29:28,145
Our people will be ready,
sir, once we find it.

531
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:28,911
All right.

532
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:33,719
I don't have to remind both of
you of the consequences if we fail.

533
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:36,517
Everyone here understands
what's at stake, sir.

534
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:40,779
Excuse Me, Miss Driscoll?

535
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:42,216
Dr. Sanford's on line two.

536
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:43,305
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:46,607
I'll meet you on the floor.

538
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,429
Yes, doctor?

539
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:55,792
I'm sorry to bother you,
but Maya's acting out again.

540
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:56,982
What is she doing?

541
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,691
She's being abusive to my staff.

542
00:29:58,726 --> 00:29:59,968
She's broken a few things.

543
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:03,340
If she doesn't settle down, I'm going to
have to move her to a private hospital.

544
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,522
We're not equipped to
handle a patient like Maya.

545
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,465
All right, don't do anything.

546
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:08,471
I'll be right there.

547
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:18,683
Sarah?

548
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,288
Excuse me.

549
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:21,968
Is Edgar still online with NRC?

550
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:22,524
Yes.

551
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,937
They found any alternate
ways to stop the meltdowns?

552
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,382
Not without the override, no.

553
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,023
What's happening at the rocklyn building?

554
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,424
Castle just called in.

555
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:31,205
His teams are spread out on the perimeter.

556
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,081
What about Curtis?

557
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,271
He's about to meet up with
Jack inside the building.

558
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:35,675
Okay, where are you monitoring?

559
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:36,460
Station three.

560
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:37,805
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.

561
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,581
Make sure everything's
ready and calm if Jack

562
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,099
and Curtis get their
hands on the override.

563
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:41,521
OK.

564
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:47,755
You're a cruel person.

565
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,738
Do you know that?

566
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:49,686
Maya, please.

567
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:51,330
This is a restricted area.

568
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:52,707
You have to stay in your bed.

569
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:53,833
Stay in my bed?

570
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:54,925
What am I, a baby?

571
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:56,138
Maya!

572
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:58,078
What do you want, mother?

573
00:30:58,113 --> 00:30:58,588
Don'T.

574
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,233
Please, don't treat these
people disrespectfully.

575
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,219
Please don't tell me what to do!

576
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:12,698
I'll stop telling you what to do
when you stop behaving like a child.

577
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:13,259
What?

578
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:14,160
You heard me.

579
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,452
There are other people in this world
besides you and they have problems, too.

580
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,253
Now, are you gonna
get a grip on yourself

581
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:27,258
or am I going to have to call
security and have them restrain you?

582
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:28,923
You're pathetic, you know that?

583
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,982
I will not allow you
to talk to me like this.

584
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:32,646
I will not!

585
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,541
What are you going to do about it?

586
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:45,054
I...

587
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:50,624
I just want to get out of here, mommy.

588
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,499
And I will take you home,

589
00:31:58,077 --> 00:32:00,740
but I have something
I have to finish first.

590
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,817
- No...
- It's okay.

591
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:10,849
Are we clear?

592
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:13,909
Yeah.

593
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:15,361
Good.

594
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:20,111
That's my girl.

595
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:48,693
We've got a man down.

596
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:49,749
Take the wall.

597
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:58,840
You okay?

598
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:02,867
Yeah, I overheard a phone conversation
between Marwan and one of his men.

599
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:04,090
We have less than 15 minutes.

600
00:33:04,174 --> 00:33:05,099
How many are still Alive?

601
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm not sure. But at least four.

602
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:07,870
Have your men secure the floor.

603
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,388
Curtis and I are going after the override.

604
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:09,818
Which way?

605
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:10,405
This way.

606
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:12,461
What about backup?

607
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,961
No backup- we can't let
Marwan know we're coming.

608
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:16,662
What's upstairs?

609
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,728
Ids data systems.

610
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:21,423
My guess is Marwan somehow
inserted a sleeper into the company.

611
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,512
They must have used
their servers to download

612
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:25,110
the virus into the nuclear power plants.

613
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:26,695
By piggybacking on ids hardware.

614
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,173
Yeah.

615
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:28,404
Take the door.

616
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,012
All right.

617
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,698
Clear.

618
00:34:12,788 --> 00:34:14,040
Step away from the door, ma'am.

619
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,733
I need you to exit the building.

620
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:16,387
It's an emergency.

621
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:18,729
You ready?

622
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:19,127
Yeah.

623
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:20,099
Let's go.

624
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,038
Did you get a description on him?

625
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,175
No.

626
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,117
It could be anyone.

627
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:04,319
Hey, bob, what's going on?

628
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:46,289
Yes?

629
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:47,346
Marwan, it's Ali.

630
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:48,489
We've been discovered!

631
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:52,149
Ali?

632
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,018
Make sure all the exits
are covered on all floors.

633
00:36:59,233 --> 00:36:59,844
Roger that.

634
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:01,999
Last man down.

635
00:37:40,485 --> 00:37:41,032
Curtis!

636
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:51,507
Stay down!

637
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:56,896
Stay down!

638
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:58,853
I got this exit!

639
00:37:59,359 --> 00:37:59,956
You got him?

640
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:00,621
No!

641
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:05,449
Jack, I have the override!

642
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:06,666
Secure it!

643
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:09,226
Call CTU now!

644
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:10,219
Now!

645
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:12,850
I got him!

646
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:19,586
Driscoll.

647
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,748
Erin, it's Curtis.

648
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:21,682
I have the override.

649
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,293
Put Edgar on.

650
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:23,148
Edgar, line one.

651
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:23,945
It's Curtis.

652
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,784
He has the override.

653
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,743
This is Edgar Stiles.

654
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,827
Is the override logged in?

655
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:27,417
Yes.

656
00:38:27,744 --> 00:38:28,625
Send it to channel 11.

657
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,172
I can'T.

658
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:32,425
What do you mean you can't?

659
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:34,357
All the fields are write-protected.

660
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:35,398
It's not supposed to be.

661
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,108
If you're directly
plugged into the override,

662
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:38,569
you should be able to
do anything you want.

663
00:38:38,604 --> 00:38:39,980
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's locked up.

664
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:40,824
What do you want me to do?

665
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,200
Miss Driscoll, the clinic just called.

666
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:43,343
Tell them they're going to have to wait.

667
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:44,669
- They said it was an...
- Tell them!

668
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,444
Edgar, we're out of time.

669
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,852
If you're going to do something, do it now.

670
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:51,297
Marwan was the engineer on the project.

671
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,058
He must've modified
the override to do this.

672
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:55,993
The NRC screen is showing the
meltdown stage is already beginning.

673
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,354
Edgar, do something!

674
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:59,013
Curtis, there must be a hot key.

675
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,441
There's a lot of keys, Edgar.

676
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:01,922
I can't just try random combinations.

677
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:02,781
It'll take too long.

678
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:04,583
Press the function keys one at a time.

679
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,397
The status window on the bottom will
light up when you get to an active one.

680
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,081
F5.

681
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,569
Good, hold it down and press "escape. "

682
00:39:13,038 --> 00:39:13,510
Nothing.

683
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:14,910
Try F5, shift, Escape.

684
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:17,907
Okay, it's responding.

685
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:19,061
Good, set it to channel 11.

686
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:19,539
Hurry up.

687
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,082
Edgar, now they have three
plants in meltdown initiation.

688
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:39,157
Did you get it?

689
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:40,891
I hope so.

690
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,333
It's starting to respond.

691
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,191
Yes!

692
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:07,180
The temperature is dropping
on all remaining power plants.

693
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:09,749
Good work.

694
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:15,072
Congratulations, Edgar!

695
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:25,038
Great work, Erin.

696
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:26,456
Thank you, sir.

697
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:27,960
Excuse me.

698
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,425
Maya?

699
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:02,641
Where is she?

700
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,252
Maya?

701
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:07,963
Oh!

702
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,535
Oh!

703
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:13,574
Oh, baby...

704
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,223
Oh...

705
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:30,349
It's over, sir.

706
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,500
We've stopped the meltdown.

707
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:02,869
This is Bauer.

708
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:04,117
We got a man down.

709
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:07,109
Marwan is in the northwest
stairwell headed to ground level.

710
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:08,470
Does anybody read me?

711
00:42:09,522 --> 00:42:11,514
Jack, it's Castle. I'll get man up there.

712
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:27,715
All CTU agents: Marwan is
impersonating a CTU officer.

713
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,620
I repeat, the suspect is
impersonating a CTU officer.

714
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:38,262
Solaris, do you read me?

715
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:41,108
Solaris, do you read me?!



9999
