00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,233
In three hours,

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,701
Heller will be tried
for war crimes against humanity.

4
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,134
If he is proven guilty,

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,901
he will be executed
in accordance with our laws.

6
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:27,400
When the trial begins,

7
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,101
you may have
an opportunity to escape.

8
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:31,801
You have to take it,

9
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,901
even if it's dangerous.

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,467
When Dad told me to take
the briefcase to Omar,

11
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,600
Debbie followed me.

12
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,134
Debbie saw the warehouse

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,134
where we're holding Heller?

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,634
Yes. But father found out
she was with me,

15
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,267
and now he wants me
to get her over here.

16
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,034
You know what that means.

17
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,467
Debbie,
thank you for coming.

18
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:50,967
Sure.

19
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,667
I need you to build a fire wall

20
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:53,767
around Station Four.

21
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:54,767
Who's that?

22
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:55,834
Her name's Maryanne.

23
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,068
I just want
to make sure

24
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:58,168
she doesn't stray outside

25
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,567
the area of her assignment. Fine.

26
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:01,300
Listen to me. The terrorists
have just announced

27
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,500
that they are going to try

28
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,934
and execute Heller
in less than four hours.

29
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,434
Bring the man in now.

30
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,801
I don't think
that's the right call.

31
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,434
I believe that if I follow them,
they're going to lead me

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,134
to Secretary Heller
and the men who kidnapped him.

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,834
Jack Bauer
is no longer cooperating

34
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,134
with this investigation.

35
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,300
All departments need to be
working on the location

36
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,567
and capture of Jack Bauer

37
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,801
and the hostile that
he's tracking now.

38
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,834
Right now, our first priority
is to find these terrorists.

39
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,333
I'm going to need
satellite surveillance

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,767
to help me track them
without being seen.

41
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,134
You want me to steal

42
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,467
satellite bandwidth from CTU
without anyone knowing?

43
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,801
Yes.

44
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,634
Am I going to have
satellite coverage

45
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,534
in the next minute or two?

46
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,767
I'm sorry, Jack.

47
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,434
It's going to take
at least another five.

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,534
I'm going to have to figure out
a way to keep this guy here.

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,901
Keep working on it.

50
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,934
Everybody put your hands up now
You- don't move!

51
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:53,801
Slowly, move back
to the corner.

52
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:05,300
Everybody just stay calm.

53
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:06,867
You'll be out of here

54
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,434
before you know it.

55
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,567
You...

56
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,434
hop up on the counter,

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,434
black out
that camera.

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,467
Anybody else working
in the back?

59
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:25,934
Put your hands up.

60
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,134
Move over there with the others.

61
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,867
Now!

62
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:45,734
You have any IDs
on the other two?

63
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,367
I don't know yet.

64
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,701
If I did, I'd tell you.

65
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,168
I'll keep you updated.

66
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,233
Thank you.
Yeah, please do.

67
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,701
Briefing in five minutes.

68
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,867
County just reported
that Andrew Paige

69
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,400
was taken into their ER
in critical condition.

70
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,233
Paige? The programmer Jack

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,567
went to pick up?

72
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:03,101
That's not all.

73
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:05,400
The bodies of two unidentified
Middle Eastern men

74
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,300
were found at the site-
gunshot wounds.

75
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,300
Bauer must have done that
to save the kid.

76
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,767
Where did they find all this?

77
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,101
Moore Park.

78
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,934
It's getting out of control.

79
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,200
We lose an agent,

80
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,168
now one of our only witnesses
has been disabled.

81
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:18,600
What about
the hostile and Bauer?

82
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,400
Still at large.

83
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,600
All right.
We have less than three hours

84
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,367
before Heller is executed
in front of the country.

85
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,767
Maybe we shouldn't concentrate
everything on Bauer,

86
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:28,901
and pursue other leads.

87
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,467
Except for Heller's son,
we have

88
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,867
no other leads.
I want all tactical teams

89
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,134
working on finding Bauer
and the hostile.

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,333
You got it.

91
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,967
Keep moving back
towards the corner.

92
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,134
Move!

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,634
Everybody get down
on the ground.

94
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,667
Lady, get down
on the floor!

95
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:44,734
Take it easy.
Shut up!

96
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,834
You want to get
through this, lady,

97
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,168
you listen to me.
You understand?

98
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,168
Get down on
the floor now!

99
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,834
I want your wallets
and your cell phones.

100
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:52,600
Make it quick.

101
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,600
Where's your cell phone?

102
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,600
I don't have one.

103
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,500
Where's your cell phone?

104
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,367
What's this?

105
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,267
You some kind of cop?
No.

106
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,600
What do you need this for?

107
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,667
Protection.

108
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,434
I get my money,
no one gets hurt.

109
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,233
Do I make myself clear?

110
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,767
You, in the cap.
What's your name?

111
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,068
Doug.

112
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,233
Doug, give me your keys.

113
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,967
Which one of these
opens the front door?

114
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:32,667
Which one!?
The brass one.

115
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,367
Hi. I'm sorry. We've
got an electrical problem

116
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,300
with the store.
We're closed right now.

117
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,101
I just need
a pack of cigarettes.

118
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,567
I'm sorry. You're going
to have to go

119
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,068
to the gas station
across the street.

120
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,534
Thank you.

121
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,001
O'Brian.

122
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,034
The satellite up yet?

123
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,267
No. I have to reposition

124
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,600
without Driscoll noticing.

125
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,600
Where are you?

126
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,967
I'm at a Mercury
Mart in Solmas.

127
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,101
I had to
stage a robbery

128
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,434
to keep the hostile in place. What?

129
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,834
It was the only way
I could stop him

130
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,034
from getting back
on the road.

131
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,001
How much longer?

132
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,200
It's going
to take ten minutes.

133
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,200
Son of a bitch.

134
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,168
Chloe, please hurry.

135
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,701
I'll get back to you.
Chloe?

136
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,134
Driscoll's
called a briefing.

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,867
I'll be there
in a couple minutes.

138
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:46,267
Chloe, now.

139
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,967
Where you going?

140
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:02,333
To a briefing.

141
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,434
Should I be in there?

142
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,767
No.

143
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,400
Hi. I'm Maryanne.
I'm helping out today.

144
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,701
Okay.

145
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:09,901
And you are?

146
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:12,001
This is
Chloe O'Brian,

147
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:13,500
our senior sys tech.

148
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,801
She doesn't have time
to chat either, Maryanne.

149
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,867
It's nice to meet you, Chloe.

150
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,767
As some of you know,
about an hour ago,

151
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,001
a hostile abducted a witness
in this case-

152
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,867
Andrew Paige.
Do we have any idea

153
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,267
where this hostile is now?

154
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,701
No, but we have general
direction of travel.

155
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,901
County Emergency Services
just called this in.

156
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,867
His best route of escape
is the freeway.

157
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,500
He'll likely
dump his vehicle

158
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,634
and try to
hijack another one.

159
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,267
This is Andrew Paige.

160
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,801
He was apparently tortured-
and about to be killed-

161
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,168
when, it seems,
Jack Bauer intervened.

162
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,434
Assuming this took place
in the last half hour,

163
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,001
and that the hostile was
continuing east, he's somewhere

164
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:55,034
in the northeastern corridor
of Ventura County.

165
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:57,233
We'll coordinate
with Caltrans,

166
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,567
CHP and Ventura Sheriff
to set up watch points.

167
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:02,634
I want every available
resource on this. Edgar,

168
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:04,734
take the lead
in satellite positioning.

169
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,500
Sara, you'll
coordinate with NSA.

170
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,534
That's all, thank you.

171
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:11,701
Chloe?

172
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,534
I'm sorry
about Andrew.

173
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,901
I know he was
a friend of yours.

174
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,300
They said
there's a good chance

175
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,434
that he'll pull through.

176
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,168
Thanks.

177
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,200
And, Chloe,
there's nothing

178
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,934
you could have done.

179
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,333
I want you to put a
pipeline on Chloe's system.

180
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,333
What for?

181
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,801
She knew about Andrew Paige.

182
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:37,867
How do
you know that?

183
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,400
Her reactions.

184
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,068
Which means she's been
in touch with Jack Bauer.

185
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:44,834
Well, I'll need
her access code.

186
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,600
Doug!

187
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,001
Get over here now!

188
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,701
Open the safe.

189
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,667
That's it?
Yeah.

190
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:21,034
Why don't you
take it and leave?

191
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,634
I won't say anything
to the.

192
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,834
When does your armored truck
make its pickup?

193
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,134
About 12:30.

194
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,634
What, you want to rob
the armored truck, too?

195
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,667
Shut up.
Get back in the corner.

196
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:31,734
Move!

197
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:40,934
Is he going to keep us here
another two hours?

198
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,168
We have to do something
to stop him.

199
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,967
Damn it.

200
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,834
Something is wrong.

201
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,267
Kaleel is not
answering his phone.

202
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,333
Maybe he's out of range.

203
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,467
No. Not for this long.

204
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:00,734
Check with our people
in the area.

205
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,567
Find out if anything
has happened to him.

206
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,801
Kaleel may not
be here in time.

207
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:11,467
We'll have to start booting
up the routers without him.

208
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,967
Take care of it.

209
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,300
Let my daughter go.

210
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,001
You don't need her.

211
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:22,168
She has already
been useful.

212
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,500
Please.

213
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,967
I'll do whatever you want.

214
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:27,333
I know you will.

215
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,367
That's why we are keeping her.

216
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,634
I don't care if you kill me.

217
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,934
But if you kill her,
even your own people

218
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:37,567
will see you as a barbaric pig.

219
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,534
Is this what your religion
teaches you?

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,034
Dad. Dad.

221
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,534
Calm down.

222
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,034
You all right?

223
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:51,734
I'm fine.

224
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,667
Where's your medication?

225
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:54,834
Your nitroglycerin.

226
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,068
Where is it?

227
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,333
I left it in the car.

228
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,400
My father has a heart condition.

229
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,200
He needs his medication.

230
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,901
Any indication Chloe's
been in contact with Bauer?

231
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:27,767
No.

232
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,134
Keep watching.

233
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,467
This is Edgar Stiles.

234
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,467
Edgar, it's Chloe.

235
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:51,600
Why are you calling me?

236
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,168
I need to talk
to you in private.

237
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,233
Meet me in Archives.

238
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,168
When?
Now.

239
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,834
Why are we meeting like this?
I'm busy.

240
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,333
Edgar, I need you to help me.

241
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Help you with what?

242
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,701
Sara piped in to my system.

243
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,801
Why would she do that?

244
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,333
Driscoll must have
asked her to,

245
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,068
otherwise she wouldn't
even have access.

246
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:29,467
Well, if Driscoll's
spying on ya,

247
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:30,867
I'm sure she's
got a good reason.

248
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,001
I'm not getting involved.

249
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,634
I've been in contact
with Jack Bauer.

250
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:34,967
What?!

251
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:36,434
That's right,
now you're involved.

252
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,767
So you're either going to
help me or you're going

253
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,168
to turn me in.
I'm turning you in.

254
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,600
Jack can find Heller
if he's allowed

255
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,701
to follow the hostile,
but Driscoll won't let him.

256
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,034
That's her call.

257
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,600
She's wrong.

258
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,734
That's your opinion.

259
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,400
These decisions
are not ours to make.

260
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,567
How about if you do
it as a favor to me?

261
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,567
How many times
have I helped you

262
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,034
since you started here?

263
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,367
A lot.

264
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:56,934
What about the
first two weeks

265
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,634
when I had to do
all your work

266
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,168
for you because
you were too nervous?

267
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,634
You owe me.

268
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,767
You're asking me to do something
that can get me fired.

269
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,068
Not if I say
I ordered you to do it.

270
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:08,634
Remember, I outrank you.

271
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:10,600
I'd take the heat.

272
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:13,434
What do I have to do?

273
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,934
I need to reposition
the satellite for Jack,

274
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,300
and I need to do it now.

275
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,101
Since Sarah's piping my system,

276
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,934
we have to use yours.

277
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,034
Okay.

278
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:23,567
Send it to Archives Three.

279
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:25,333
Transfer my calls there.

280
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,434
I want to know
who's in charge here.

281
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,634
I want to speak

282
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,834
to the man who was just in here.

283
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,101
You'll speak to him later.

284
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:55,500
No, now!

285
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,734
I am the Secretary
of Defense

286
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,967
of the United States
of America.

287
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,567
You will listen to me!

288
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:02,967
Dad, don't make it worse.

289
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,367
What do you mean, worse?!

290
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,701
What could be worse than
waiting around here

291
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:10,233
to be murdered by a bunch
of lawless, Godless thugs?

292
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,233
Dad, calm down.

293
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,168
I don't want to calm down!

294
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,001
Don't tell me to calm down!

295
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,267
What's the point?

296
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,834
We're here, okay? The best thing
we could do

297
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,068
is keep our heads, and hope
that someone comes along...

298
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:20,068
Hope?

299
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,967
Hope that we
get rescued?

300
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,967
We have to do something!
We have to take...

301
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,701
Dad, what is it?

302
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,300
What's happening?

303
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,134
Okay, try to take a deep breath.
I need help.

304
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,767
Look, help me, please.

305
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,400
I... I think he's
having a heart attack.

306
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:33,967
Dad, look, you've
got to lie down.

307
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:35,001
Lie down.
You've got to...

308
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,168
Dad, are you
listening to me?

309
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,333
It's okay, he's coming.

310
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
Step back.
Hurry.

311
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,734
Move away from him.

312
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,300
You need to lie him down,
please!

313
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,500
Hurry. Look...

314
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,634
Step away.

315
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,333
Go on, get out of here!

316
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,534
Still with me?

317
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,934
Yeah.

318
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,767
Let's go.

319
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,434
Go back, go back.

320
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,567
Put your weapon down, slowly.

321
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:59,034
Both of you,
hands on your head.

322
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,300
If another one of my men dies,

323
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,600
your daughter will be killed.

324
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,101
When the armored truck pulls up,
how many men come inside?

325
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,500
Two. One stays by the door
and one picks up the money.

326
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,034
They park in the front
or the back?

327
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:26,467
In the front,
by the street.

328
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,734
Come on, let's go.

329
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:29,967
Everybody up!

330
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:32,767
We're moving to the back
of the store! Now!

331
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:33,867
Stand over there.

332
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,101
Look, the longer
you keep us here...

333
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,101
Shut up!

334
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,434
Let's go!

335
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:45,001
You try that again
and I will kill you.

336
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,400
You understand me?

337
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,634
Get up.

338
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:48,567
Now!

339
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,801
Move to the back of the store.

340
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,734
Damn it.

341
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:02,934
Everybody in the freezer now!

342
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,233
Not you.

343
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,001
Move.

344
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:06,834
Anybody makes a sound,

345
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,667
I kill all of you.

346
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:21,801
Doug, you in there?

347
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,500
Make him go away.

348
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:37,701
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

349
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:38,934
I was in the back room.

350
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,068
How come
you're closed?

351
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm taking inventory.

352
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,300
In the middle of the day?

353
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,734
Yeah.

354
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:48,867
Okay, um...

355
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,034
Sure everything's all right?

356
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:53,168
Yeah, fine.

357
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,068
You don't
look fine, Doug.

358
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm just
a little tired.

359
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,300
Thanks, Bill.

360
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,634
You mind if I use the head?

361
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,400
It's... broken.

362
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,600
Something's
wrong here.

363
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,134
Now you going to
tell me what it is,

364
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,168
or do I have to come in
and see for myself?

365
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,001
Don't even
think about it.

366
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,901
Step inside now.

367
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,101
Move.

368
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,600
Grab that counter.

369
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,467
Doug, lock the door.

370
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,333
JACK:
Give me the keys.

371
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,333
I want you
to go over there,

372
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,567
give me his gun and his radio.

373
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:23,901
Move, come on!

374
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,734
Take out his cuffs.

375
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,967
Officer, put your hands
behind your back.

376
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,233
Cuff him.

377
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:42,068
Go back to the freezer.

378
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:43,767
Let's go.

379
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,623
At this time, we have
no more information

380
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,024
regarding the kidnapping

381
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,057
of Secretary of Defense
James Heller

382
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:20,490
and his daughter Audrey

383
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,424
other than the image
you are now seeing, which was...

384
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,757
My husband and I realize
we've been unfair to you.

385
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,724
We've treated
you as badly

386
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,458
as we have been
treated ourselves,

387
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:34,024
by certain ignorant people.

388
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:36,291
Well, it was pretty obvious

389
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:39,191
you didn't approve
of us going out.

390
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,057
Is that okay to say?

391
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,124
Yeah, it's okay.

392
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,091
Well, we hope you'll
accept our apology.

393
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:52,024
That means a lot to me.

394
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,424
That said,

395
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,157
there's something else
I want to discuss with you.

396
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:58,057
What's that?

397
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,623
This morning,
you followed Behrooz

398
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,657
to his father's warehouse.

399
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,957
Oh.

400
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:10,724
Um... I thought Behrooz
was seeing someone else.

401
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,991
I got jealous.

402
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,557
Oh, I understand.

403
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:18,124
But Mr. Araz moved
his inventory there

404
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,623
because he's been
robbed a few times.

405
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,458
And we've been trying to keep
that place secret

406
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,024
so it doesn't
happen again.

407
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,557
I promise I won't tell
anyone where it is.

408
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:29,924
Good.

409
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,957
And you haven't told anyone yet?

410
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,291
No.

411
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:36,057
I haven't talked to anyone
but Behrooz today.

412
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:38,191
Well, then that's settled.

413
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:41,091
Thank you for inviting me
here, Mrs. Araz.

414
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:43,358
It's my pleasure.

415
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,091
Has Behrooz ever
shown you pictures

416
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:46,391
from when he was a child?

417
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,324
No.

418
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,291
Show her, Behrooz.

419
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,557
Have a look
at these.

420
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:57,957
I'll be right back.

421
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:06,957
Oh, my God.

422
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,424
That's not you.

423
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,291
It is.

424
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,291
You were so cute.

425
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,657
Thank you, Hannah.

426
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,924
You're welcome.

427
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,157
Have you been following this,
Mr. Araz?

428
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,957
Yes, it's horrible.

429
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,924
It makes it so difficult

430
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:36,358
for the rest of us

431
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,324
when people from home
do these unspeakable things.

432
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,391
I agree.

433
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,291
Yes.

434
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,490
The girl didn't tell anyone.

435
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:51,924
Are you sure?
Yes.

436
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,690
Good. It'll be taken
care of, then?

437
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:56,124
Soon.

438
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,291
Have Behrooz do it.

439
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:58,557
He created this problem.

440
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,358
He should be responsible
for solving it himself.

441
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:01,424
I agree.

442
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,824
I'll call you when it's done.

443
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,890
Thank you.

444
00:21:04,957 --> 00:21:07,391
2-Charles-Nine.
This is Station Four.

445
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,890
There's a 2-11 in progress

446
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:12,824
at 2221 Mill Road,
cross street Cedar.

447
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,957
Two males seen
leaving bank with shotguns.

448
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,024
Respond Code Three.

449
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:21,224
Two-Charles-Nine.
Do you copy?

450
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:25,824
Stand back from the door!

451
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,391
Step back!

452
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,657
Two-Charles-Nine.
Do you copy?

453
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:30,991
You...

454
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,557
Are you Unit Nine?

455
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,957
Yeah.

456
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:35,757
You tell them
you're on your way.

457
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:37,358
One wrong word
and I will kill you.

458
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:38,757
Now.

459
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:42,358
Two-Charles-Nine...

460
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:44,991
Help! We're being robbed!

461
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:47,391
Two-Charles-Nine.
We have help on the way.

462
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,124
Get up, now.

463
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:52,257
Now's your time to let us go
before the cops get here.

464
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,424
Shut up.

465
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:58,724
These people are
your responsibility.

466
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,124
You'd better start
talking to them.

467
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:25,790
Sara,

468
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:28,523
has Chloe had any
contact with Bauer yet?

469
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,824
No.

470
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,157
What about the work she's doing?

471
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,224
Could it be on his behalf?

472
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,157
No. I've been watching
her system.

473
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:35,857
Chloe is not stupid.

474
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:39,024
Assume she's taking measures
to protect herself.

475
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,191
Maybe she's co-opted the help
of someone else inside.

476
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:43,991
I'm not quite sure
how much of my time

477
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:46,157
you want me to devote
to this, Miss Driscoll.

478
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:48,424
I expect you to be able
to walk and chew gum

479
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,657
at the same time, Sara.

480
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,024
Chloe's loyal to Bauer.

481
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:52,857
There's a good chance
that she's helping him.

482
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:54,890
Find out how.

483
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,191
What are you doing?

484
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:07,924
That looks like
a satellite screen.

485
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:08,957
It was.
I mean, it is.

486
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,091
A satellite for what?

487
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,024
We're trying to find
Bauer, remember?

488
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,324
Division's already doing that.

489
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:15,391
I'm just going over
what they're doing.

490
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,523
Sometimes they miss data.

491
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,424
Do they know
that you're doing that?

492
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,690
Yeah, they know what I'm doing.

493
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,690
Here, call them if
you don't believe me.

494
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,857
Relax, Edgar.

495
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:25,991
I don't have to call anybody.

496
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:28,057
Do what you have to do.

497
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:29,458
I will.

498
00:23:33,957 --> 00:23:36,523
Do me a favor?

499
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,623
There's a chance that Jack
might try to contact Chloe.

500
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,358
If you see or hear anything,
call me, okay?

501
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,724
Why would Jack try
to contact Chloe?

502
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,523
He just might.
Let me know.

503
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,557
Sure.

504
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:02,623
Edgar Stiles.

505
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,790
Edgar, what did she want?

506
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,490
She wants to nail you
to the wall

507
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:06,790
and take a piece out of me, too.

508
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:08,024
Remember our deal.

509
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:10,557
If you get caught,
you don't take me with you.

510
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:11,657
And if I get caught,

511
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:13,191
you say you ordered me
to do this.

512
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:14,790
You don't have
to repeat the deal.

513
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,391
I'm the one who
came up with it.

514
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,191
Did you reposition
the satellite yet?

515
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,724
I'm working on it.

516
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,091
Leave me alone.

517
00:24:24,257 --> 00:24:26,157
No, let them stay in the field.

518
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,291
We'll use our
own people for that.

519
00:24:29,557 --> 00:24:30,557
Hang on, Ed.

520
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:31,824
Yes, what is it?

521
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,890
Miss Driscoll,
your daughter's on line two.

522
00:24:33,957 --> 00:24:36,024
I'm busy.
Tell her I'll call her back.

523
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,924
She says it's important.

524
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:40,224
Fine.

525
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,890
Ed, I'm going to have
to get back to you.

526
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:42,890
All right.

527
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:43,957
Okay, bye.

528
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,024
Maya?

529
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:47,924
I need you to come home.

530
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:48,991
What's wrong?

531
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:50,523
I'm having a bad day.

532
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,257
Sweetheart, have you been taking
your medication?

533
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,424
No.

534
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,890
If you don't take it,

535
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,057
you're going
to feel bad.

536
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:58,157
Now, you know that.

537
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:00,024
It numbs me.
I don't like it.

538
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:02,157
Do you like feeling
like this better?

539
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:03,157
Come home.

540
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:04,857
I can't, Maya.

541
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:05,857
Why not?

542
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:06,957
Listen to me.

543
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:08,224
I want you to take the pills

544
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,224
and I'll call you back

545
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,424
as soon as I can, all right?

546
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,257
You promise?

547
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:12,224
Of course, I promise.

548
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,557
What are you going to do?

549
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:16,391
I'll take my pills.

550
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,824
Good.

551
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,890
Do you love me?

552
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:19,924
You know I do.

553
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:22,590
Then why don't you say it?

554
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:25,458
I love you,
Maya. Okay?

555
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,024
Okay.

556
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:29,257
All right, bye.

557
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:39,191
Behrooz, can I
see you for a moment?

558
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:41,157
Yes.

559
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,458
I'll be right back.

560
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:43,657
Okay.

561
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:57,757
I talked
to your father.

562
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,924
We both agree you have
to be the one

563
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,458
who'll take care of this.

564
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:07,391
But she didn't tell anyone.

565
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,358
And we're fortunate
that's the case.

566
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:11,790
But she still
saw the warehouse

567
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:14,257
and she could tell
the authorities about it,

568
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:18,324
if she's ever
brought in for questioning.

569
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:22,091
This is riskier
than letting her live.

570
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:24,358
If she disappears,
her mother will call the.

571
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,257
By the time
this day is over,

572
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:29,991
the will be too busy
to look for a runaway girl.

573
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,724
Now take it.

574
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,690
Don't make me bring
your father into this.

575
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:39,757
Just take her
to the basement and do it.

576
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:42,824
Don't think about it.
Get it over

577
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,491
Behrooz.

578
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:25,157
Hey.

579
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:26,290
Everything okay?

580
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:27,791
Yeah.

581
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,557
I want to make
a copy of this one.

582
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:31,357
Can I take it home
and scan it?

583
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:33,123
Sure.

584
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:42,858
We need to get out of here.

585
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:43,624
What?

586
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:44,524
You're in danger.

587
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:45,724
Are you kidding?
From who?

588
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,190
Don't ask questions,
just come with me.

589
00:27:47,257 --> 00:27:48,858
What? Behrooz...
Trust me, Debbie.

590
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:52,157
Trust me, Debbie.

591
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,090
We're okay. Come on.

592
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,090
I can't.

593
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,123
Why not?
What's wrong?

594
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,123
I don't know.

595
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,324
Debbie?

596
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,791
Debbie,
what's wrong?

597
00:28:03,858 --> 00:28:04,791
Answer me, Debbie,
what's wrong?

598
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,190
Come on, Debbie,
what's wrong?

599
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,958
Get up, Debbie,
we need to go, Come on.

600
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,257
Please help me!
Come on, Deb!

601
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,390
What's wrong, Debbie?

602
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:14,757
Come on, Debbie!

603
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:17,123
Come on.
Debbie, what's wrong?

604
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:23,491
What did you do to her?

605
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:26,424
I didn't expect you
to be able to do it.

606
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,657
Debbie?
Debbie?

607
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:34,123
Come on, Debbie!

608
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,858
Debbie!

609
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:48,424
Give me the gun.

610
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:55,624
Give me the gun.

611
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:00,324
Hey!

612
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:16,123
I am so disappointed in you.

613
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:00,824
Yeah.

614
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:02,990
This is Sergeant Dennis McGrath.

615
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:04,591
You know you're surrounded.

616
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:07,557
You should know that I've got
hostages and I will kill them,

617
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:10,157
if you try to use tear gas
and send your men in.

618
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,057
Let's not go there
yet, okay?

619
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:13,691
Who do you have
in there?

620
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,724
The owner, two
men and a woman.

621
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,524
What about Officer Datson?

622
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:18,891
Yeah, I've got him, too.

623
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,257
You only need one hostage
to protect yourself.

624
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:23,457
Keep Officer Datson
and let the others go.

625
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:24,791
I need to think about that.

626
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,157
Yeah?

627
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,390
I've got satellite coverage.

628
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:53,057
Okay, good.

629
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:54,390
The suspect will be free
in about five minutes.

630
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:56,757
He'll be traveling
on foot on Route 11.

631
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:58,624
I'll find him.

632
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:19,224
One of you is coming with me.

633
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:28,624
You.

634
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:31,824
Come here.

635
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,891
Put your hands up
against the rack. Now!

636
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,457
Everybody else,
to the back of the cooler.

637
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,357
Move!

638
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:46,657
Open the door.

639
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,157
Lock the door
with the chain.

640
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,691
Now, I will let you go
as soon as we are clear.

641
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,491
But if you try and be a hero
again, I will kill you.

642
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:05,491
Do you understand me?

643
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,491
I understand.

644
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,691
Good.

645
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:09,591
Let's go.

646
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:10,724
Which car is yours?

647
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:11,791
The blue Lexus.

648
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,324
Unlock the door.

649
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,057
Move.

650
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:23,257
Tell those officers
to put their weapons down

651
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,757
and take five steps back!

652
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,057
Okay, calm down.

653
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:28,290
We're going to try
and help you through this.

654
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:29,858
Tell them to do it now!

655
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:32,491
Okay, drop your weapons
and move back!

656
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,090
JACK:
Stand back!

657
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:43,724
Do what he says. Step back.

658
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,357
Step back.

659
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,290
Come on. Come on.

660
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,591
Open the door.

661
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:53,924
Come on, open the driver's door.

662
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:56,757
You try and follow me,

663
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,457
I will shoot him!

664
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:01,791
On my count, get in.

665
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:04,190
One, two, three, move.

666
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,257
Go! Go!

667
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,657
Call in a roadblock.

668
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:19,157
Suspect driving east

669
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:20,324
on Route 11.

670
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,691
One hostage.

671
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:37,724
Move the rearview mirror to the
right so I can see out the back.

672
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:43,657
There.

673
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,958
When do you let me go?

674
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,324
When I feel like it.

675
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:51,824
Who are you?

676
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,457
What do you mean?

677
00:33:53,524 --> 00:33:54,858
You don't seem like
the kind of guy

678
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:56,290
that needs to rob
a Mercury Mart.

679
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:58,357
That Mercury Mart
was a money drop.

680
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:01,123
There was supposed to be
18 grand in that safe.

681
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,791
How do you know that?

682
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:06,624
We're done sharing.

683
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:07,824
I'm not gonna forget your face,

684
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:09,090
and I've got
your driver's license.

685
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:11,190
You talk to the,
it's not gonna be hard

686
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,891
to find you,
do you understand me?

687
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:15,824
I won't tell them a thing.

688
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,124
Okay, pull over here.

689
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,157
Now!

690
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:28,257
Get out of the car.

691
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:30,324
Move!

692
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:32,758
Start running.

693
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,823
Now!

694
00:34:57,957 --> 00:34:58,923
O'Brian.

695
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,057
You got him?

696
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:01,324
Yeah.

697
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,823
Good work. Now download
his position on my PDA.

698
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,957
And stay reachable.

699
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,624
I will.

700
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,790
I'm sorry,
could you repeat that?

701
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:31,924
Hold on a second.

702
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,857
Miss Driscoll?
Yes, Sara, what is it?

703
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,957
You have a phone call
from a man who says

704
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:38,723
he's your neighbor-
a George Cliocove?

705
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,157
He says it's about
your daughter.

706
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:42,257
What line?
Six.

707
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,024
George, it's Erin.

708
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:47,357
Erin, there's been
another incident with Maya.

709
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:49,424
What's happened?

710
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:51,623
She came into the backyard
where Evan was playing,

711
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,324
and she started
screaming at him again.

712
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:54,524
Is Evan okay?

713
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,424
Yes. Fortunately,
I was home.

714
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:00,224
But this is the end, Erin.

715
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,590
I've got to
protect my boy.

716
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:03,224
Did you call
the, George?

717
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,957
Yes, I did.
They're on their way.

718
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:06,091
Where's Maya now?

719
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:07,690
She went back to your house.

720
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:09,191
I'm very sorry, George.

721
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:10,990
This will not happen again.

722
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:13,091
It can't, Erin.

723
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,091
Miss Driscoll,
is everything all right?

724
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:22,057
No, it's not.

725
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:24,558
Is there anything
I can do to help?

726
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,524
Yes.

727
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:34,957
I need you to call LAPD
Westside and find out

728
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,957
who they dispatched
to pick up my daughter.

729
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:38,424
She has a medical condition.

730
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,124
She suffers from
schizophrenia.

731
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:42,723
There was an incident
with one of my neighbors.

732
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:45,558
What would you like me to do

733
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:47,524
once I find out
who they dispatched?

734
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,191
Tell the officers
to cancel the call.

735
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:50,623
I'll take care
of it personally.

736
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,257
Yeah, I don't think
that's possible.

737
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,224
Once a call's in progress, don't
they have to follow through?

738
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:57,057
CTU has preemptive
privilege over local.

739
00:36:57,124 --> 00:36:58,924
Yes, but that's only in
a national security situation.

740
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,157
Sara, I'm asking you
to do something.

741
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:04,924
Should I ask someone else?

742
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,558
No.

743
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:08,990
I'll do it.

744
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:12,257
Send a unit over
to my house.

745
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:14,491
One medic,
one field agent.

746
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:16,458
Bring Maya back
to our clinic.

747
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:17,857
Yes, ma'am.

748
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:19,224
Thank you.

749
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,590
Yeah, I got it.

750
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:25,524
Thanks.

751
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:28,924
I found Jack Bauer.

752
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,757
Where is he?

753
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:34,623
In Solmas. He's still
tracking the hostile,

754
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,091
only now he's
using satellite.

755
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:37,391
How do you know that?

756
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,890
DOD just called
to complain that

757
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,890
someone over here was
stealing bandwidth.

758
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:42,790
I took a look at the
imagery and found him.

759
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:44,491
All right,
bring them both in.

760
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:46,224
Who logged on
to that satellite?

761
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,357
Chloe.

762
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:49,957
Chloe, why are
you logged on

763
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:51,657
to an active DOD satellite?

764
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,957
All right,
you're done here.

765
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,558
Whatever,
I was gonna quit anyway.

766
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,690
You're not being fired.
You're being arrested.

767
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:01,757
Call security.

768
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:02,757
Edgar,

769
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,124
lock up her systems

770
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:05,757
and take control
of all her files.

771
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,890
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:09,291
I want you
to call Jack Bauer now.

773
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:21,657
Yeah.

774
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:23,091
Driscoll wants to talk to you.

775
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:24,424
What are you talking about?

776
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:25,424
Hello, Jack.

777
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:26,690
Erin... look, I've got

778
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:27,957
some information for you.

779
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:30,224
The hostile's name
is Kaleel Hassein.

780
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,424
Stand down, Jack. It's over.

781
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:33,957
Erin, right now Hassein is free.

782
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:35,590
He's looking for
a car and a phone.

783
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:37,391
Once he has those things,
he's gonna lead us

784
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,990
straight to Secretary
Heller, I promise.

785
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:40,291
You can't know that
for sure.

786
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:41,491
What have you
got to lose?

787
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:42,857
You've got him
on satellite.

788
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,091
Just bombard the area
with a receptor beacon.

789
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,890
Send a team to pick
up the hostile.

790
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,458
Damn it, Erin, if you do that,
everything I've done over

791
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:50,790
the last two hours
will mean nothing!

792
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:53,357
I'm glad you finally
figured that out.

793
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:54,558
Erin!

794
00:38:56,757 --> 00:38:58,558
Take Ms. O'Brian into holding.

795
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,623
ERIN: Edgar... you
have it up on satellite?

796
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,524
EDGAR:
Yeah.

797
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,458
The hostile's
flagging down a car.

798
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:14,657
You need some help?
Yeah.

799
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:15,824
I just, uh...

800
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:46,623
Give me the feed down here.

801
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,024
Sara, what's the load

802
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,723
on the cell tower
in that area?

803
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,091
About 40 to 50 calls.

804
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,491
Put personnel on every call.
Record every call.

805
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,324
Let's see
if he contacts someone.

806
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:06,091
Yes?
Omar, it's me.

807
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:07,224
Where have you been?

808
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,391
We've been worried.

809
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,558
Everything's fine.

810
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:10,723
I'll explain later.

811
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,857
Where are you?

812
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:13,458
I'll be there
within the hour.

813
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:15,057
Is the broadcast
on schedule?

814
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,224
Yes.

815
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,291
We're about to prepare Heller.

816
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:19,657
Hurry.

817
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:24,524
Edgar.

818
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,790
Not now.
Yes,

819
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:26,690
now.

820
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,024
How do you feel about

821
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:30,024
what's happening
to Chloe?

822
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,757
What do you mean?

823
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:34,558
She's not just
gonna lose her job,

824
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:35,824
she might go to prison.

825
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,257
What do you care about all this?

826
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,157
I overheard the conversation
you had earlier.

827
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:42,491
I know you were working with her
behind Driscoll's back.

828
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:44,257
What do you want?

829
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:46,091
I want to make sure
I have your attention

830
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,857
whenever I need it.

831
00:40:50,623 --> 00:40:51,857
Thanks, Robin.

832
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:52,790
Miss Driscoll,

833
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:55,458
we got the call.

834
00:40:55,524 --> 00:40:56,558
ERIN:
Put it on speaker.

835
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,723
Cue it from the
top of the call.

836
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:03,790
Omar, it's me.

837
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:05,890
Where have you been?
We've been worried.

838
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:08,224
Everything's fine.
I'll explain later.

839
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,524
Where are you?

840
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,558
I'll be there
within the hour.

841
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:13,957
Is the broadcast on schedule? Yes.

842
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:15,458
We're about
to prepare Heller.

843
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:16,623
Hurry.

844
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,324
Looks like
Jack was right.

845
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,558
Tell the teams to stand down
for the time being.

846
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:28,257
Keep tracking Hassein
by satellite.

847
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,291
Son of a bitch.

848
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:22,224
Damn it!

849
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,924
Get out of the car!

850
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,590
Put your hands in the air!

851
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,790
OFFICER:
Step behind the vehicle now!

852
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:37,558
Come on! Come on!

853
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,324
Get out of the car!

854
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,391
Get your hands up Now!

855
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,623
and step out of
the vehicle!

856
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,391
Suspect is armed...

857
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,990
Step away
from the car!

858
00:42:52,057 --> 00:42:53,590
Take two
steps forward!

859
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:56,723
On your knees!

860
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,357
Put your palms down!

861
00:42:58,424 --> 00:43:00,424
Put your chest flat
on the ground!

862
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,723
Keep your hands down!
All the way down!
