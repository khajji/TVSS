2
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,234
Perviously on 24.

3
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,334
Who is this?

4
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,633
Andrew, my name is Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,334
I work for Secretary
of Defense Heller.

6
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:25,101
Secretary Heller was kidnapped
less than half an hour ago.

7
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:26,900
I believe the same people
that kidnapped him

8
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:28,367
are the ones
that are chasing you now.

9
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:29,700
The safest thing for you to do

10
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,334
right now is
let me bring you in.

11
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:32,834
I found the person
who stumbled

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,800
onto our server.

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,867
Is he with you now?

14
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,834
No, I'll have him shortly.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,234
Find out who he's talked to.

16
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,401
Who are you?

17
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:41,167
I'm the man
that's going to kill you

18
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,700
if you don't follow
my instructions.

19
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,934
This is a simple task, Behrooz,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,134
but these are the ones
where mistakes can be made.

21
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:49,700
Debbie, what are
you doing here?

22
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:50,967
I followed you.

23
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:55,768
Omar saw you
with someone

24
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,167
outside the compound.

25
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:58,734
She didn't
see anything.

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,933
I made sure of it.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,334
We've spent years
planning for this,

28
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,334
waiting for
this day to come.

29
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:06,967
Now it's here and you've
compromised everything.

30
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,768
It's a simple
job, Ronnie.

31
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,701
You pick up the subject
and you bring him in.

32
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:13,367
Bauer has not been in the field
for a year and half, okay?

33
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:16,100
Which is why I need you
to keep him on a tight leash.

34
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,167
For the record, Jack,

35
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:18,701
I think Driscoll
made a mistake

36
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:19,833
letting you
come along.

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,867
You get the gate.

38
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,100
I'll get the kid
out of the car.

39
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,800
My father's
the Secretary of Defense.

40
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:39,967
Richard,

41
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,301
right now you're
the only witness

42
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,234
to your father
and your sister's kidnapping.

43
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:45,601
We need your help.

44
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:48,334
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

45
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,267
HELLER: We'll be fine, Audie.
We're still on U.S. soil.

46
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,401
What are they going to
do to us? I don't know,

47
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:54,734
but if they wanted me dead

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,567
they would have killed
me at Richard's house.

49
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,800
Our soldiers have taken

50
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,034
the terrorist James Heller
into custody.

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,534
In three hours, Heller
will be tried for

52
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,267
war crimes against humanity.

53
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,768
If he is proven guilty,

54
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,768
he will be executed,
in accordance with our laws.

55
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,200
As you are all aware,
the Secretary of Defense

56
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:34,534
and his daughter have been
kidnapped by a terrorist cell.

57
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,200
The terrorists have announced
that they will put Jim on trial

58
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:40,034
for war crimes,
then execute him.

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,534
All of it broadcast
for the world.

60
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:48,234
Make no mistake, this
country is under attack.

61
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,634
Foreign terrorists
are operating on our soil.

62
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,134
And intelligence indicates

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,800
that the kidnapping
may be some kind of trigger,

64
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:59,434
the first step
in a series of larger attacks.

65
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,833
Mark, what kind
of protective

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,833
actions are
being taken?

67
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,833
We've changed all
the codes and protocols

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,234
the Secretary
has knowledge of.

69
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,768
Also, the other
Cabinet members

70
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:08,867
have been sequestered.

71
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:09,967
All right.
Melissa?

72
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,567
Where are we with
trying to keep

73
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,267
these people from
broadcasting?

74
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,933
The media outlets will all
cooperate and not air it.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,401
But the terrorists
have announced

76
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,800
that they will use the Internet,

77
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,434
and we cannot control that.

78
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,833
They're using technology that
makes their feed untraceable,

79
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,833
and we can't
shut down the Internet

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,000
without disabling

81
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,501
the command
and control functions

82
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,200
of the government
and the economy.

83
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:32,701
Mr. President, the only way
to stop this is at the source.

84
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:34,134
We have to find the terrorists,

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,301
and rescue
Secretary Heller.

86
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,301
Erin, where is CTU on this?

87
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,167
We have search teams
out in force

88
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,601
and we're working
a few active leads, sir.

89
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:43,734
Anything promising?

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,434
We'll know very shortly,
Mr. President.

91
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:47,034
Keep us closely posted.

92
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,234
Ladies and gentlemen,

93
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,501
nothing takes priority

94
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,967
over finding the people
who have Jim Heller

95
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,067
and stopping them.

96
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:58,467
Thank you.

97
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,234
Where are we
with Heller's son?

98
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,000
We're still trying
to find out what he knows.

99
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,234
If he had anything to do
with his father's abduction,

100
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:16,933
we need to know.
Get on it.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then try
his emergency frequency.

102
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,234
What's going on?

103
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,833
Where's Ronnie and Bauer
with the witness?

104
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,833
We don't know.
What?

105
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,267
I just got off
the phone

106
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,334
with transit. A hostile
intercepted Andrew Paige

107
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,267
at the station. We
can't reach Ronnie

108
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,867
or Jack. What do you mean you can't

109
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,501
reach them? They're not answering

110
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,768
their phones and there's
been a report of a shooting

111
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,634
at the station. I'm checking
for an update right now.

112
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,734
Get recent pictures

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,833
of Andrew Paige
and get them

114
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,067
to our people
on the ground.

115
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,867
Also set up a security
grid around the station.

116
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,000
My system's already
logged on

117
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,467
to the station.
I can get it faster.

118
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,301
All right. Fine.
You do tactical with me.

119
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,301
Let's go, Edgar.

120
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:51,601
Edgar Stiles.

121
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:52,567
Miss Driscoll.

122
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,067
Jack Bauer's on line one.

123
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,301
Where are you? Why have you

124
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,668
and Ronnie not been in contact?

125
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,367
Erin, Ronnie's been killed.

126
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,933
What are you talking about?

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He was shot by a hostile
who kidnapped Andrew Paige.

128
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:08,301
Where are you now?

129
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:10,467
I'm in transit. I'm tracking
them, but he doesn't know it.

130
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:13,167
Give me your location, and I'll
send backup to apprehend him.

131
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,734
Erin, I don't think
that's the right call.

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,601
I believe if I follow them,
they're going to lead me

133
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,501
to Secretary Heller and
the men who kidnapped him.

134
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,734
Listen to me.
Terrorists have

135
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,567
just announced that
they are going to try

136
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:22,933
and execute Heller
in less than

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,967
three hours. Bring
the man in now.

138
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,034
Right now this is our best
chance of finding him by then.

139
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,401
Jack, we had a deal.

140
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,434
Erin, you're breaking up.
Listen, have SWAT

141
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,967
and rescue teams
standing by.

142
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:36,200
I'll call you as soon as the
hostile reaches his destination.

143
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:39,467
That call-

144
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:40,701
do you have
a location?

145
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:42,234
No, it had a block on it.

146
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,634
I've just been informed
that Ronnie Lobell

147
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,467
has been killed
in the line of duty.

148
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:53,267
The killer was a hostile
connected to Heller's abduction.

149
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,434
At this point,

150
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,534
Jack Bauer is
no longer cooperating

151
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,034
with this investigation.

152
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,434
All departments need to be
working on the location

153
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,467
and capture of Jack
Bauer and the hostile

154
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:03,734
that he's tracking now.

155
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,301
Sarah, I need you
to reconfigure the grid

156
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:07,967
and to include routes
away from the station.

157
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,034
I want all ground teams on this.

158
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:19,967
MTA Downtown.

159
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:21,334
This is Chloe O'Brian from CTU.

160
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:22,768
Do you have any new information

161
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,800
about the kid who was
abducted from your station?

162
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,000
No, we told you

163
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,467
everything we had
a few minutes ago.

164
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,867
What about surveillance cams?

165
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,800
I can access them
if you give me the port codes.

166
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,334
We're looking at them
right now, Miss O'Brian.

167
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,334
There's nothing.

168
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,434
Thanks.

169
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,634
Yes?

170
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:41,933
What are you doing there?

171
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,734
I need you to help me
with this grid.

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,367
What kind of help do you need?

173
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,867
The northeast quadrant
is pass-coded and I don't...

174
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,200
Pilot L-1.
What?

175
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,501
That's the log in.

176
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,601
Chloe could you
just get back here?

177
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,534
My friend Andrew,
who I promised would be

178
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,234
okay, do you mind
if I try to find him?

179
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:07,167
Get down!

180
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,367
Yes?

181
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,367
I have the programmer.

182
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:27,768
Good. We need to know

183
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,167
what he told CTU
as soon as possible.

184
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:31,501
Proceed as planned.

185
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,668
Understood.

186
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:34,501
There was a problem
at the train station.

187
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,734
What happened?

188
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,833
A federal agent
interfered,

189
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,867
I killed him.

190
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,034
Are you being pursued?

191
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,167
No, anyone that left
the station after me

192
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,900
would have caught up
to me by now.

193
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,467
Unless they don't want you
to know they're there.

194
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,467
Take precautions.

195
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,200
Make sure that you are
not being followed. Go.

196
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,867
Move!

197
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,000
Dad.

198
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,567
You okay?

199
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,267
Did they hurt you?

200
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,267
No.

201
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,534
They just
wanted me present

202
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:17,000
while they broadcast
an announcement.

203
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,000
They're going
to put me on trial.

204
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,034
For what?

205
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,200
Crimes against humanity.

206
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,534
That's ridiculous. When?

207
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,833
Less than three hours.

208
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,100
Dad, I'm sure that
Jack and the President

209
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,401
are doing everything
they can to find us.

210
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,067
Maybe they'll get
here before then.

211
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:36,501
I can deal
with anything

212
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,401
these bastards
have got for me.

213
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,367
I wish you hadn't
come this morning, that's all.

214
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,734
This is a list of the offenses

215
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,867
you are being
charged with.

216
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,234
Sign it.

217
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm a senior member of the
United States government.

218
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm not signing it.

219
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,734
Then you will die,
Mr. Secretary.

220
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:11,768
Pick up the document
and sign it.

221
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:20,800
No!

222
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:21,833
Let her go.

223
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,534
Leave her alone, you son

224
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,067
of a bitch. Come on!
Leave her alone.

225
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:25,768
Kill her!

226
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,100
All right.

227
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,534
All right! I'll sign it!

228
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:32,534
Pick up the document.

229
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,200
Pick it up.

230
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:11,892
Where are we on finding
Bauer? So far nowhere.

231
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,261
That's unacceptable. There are
a lot of places he could be.

232
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:15,663
We're working up
everything we can.

233
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:16,899
What else are you
doing to find Heller?

234
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,199
After I'm done here

235
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,936
I'm going to find out
what his son Richard knows.

236
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:22,006
Sarah's working on the
forensics from the kidnapping.

237
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,642
Have you gotten anything new yet? No.

238
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,744
Great, what else?
Sarah Gavin.

239
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,914
We're trying to trace the origin
of the terrorist web cast. And?

240
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,049
The code's been braided, and I
can't get into the system file.

241
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,218
In other words, nothing.

242
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:32,620
Ms. Driscoll,
it's the President.

243
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:36,993
Make something happen.

244
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,768
Yes, Mr. President.

245
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,737
I understand you lost
one of your field operatives.

246
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,072
Yes, we did.

247
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,144
Did the engagement yield
any witnesses or prisoners?

248
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,179
Not yet, but
there's some hope.

249
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,648
Tell me.

250
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,818
Jack Bauer, who as you
know used to work here,

251
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,521
is currently in the field
trailing a suspect.

252
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,357
Trailing him?

253
00:11:58,424 --> 00:11:59,792
Why doesn't he bring him in?

254
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:01,494
We're in the process
of doing that, sir.

255
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:02,897
Erin,

256
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:05,300
are we going to be able
to save Jim and his daughter

257
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:08,204
before this... trial starts?

258
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:10,908
I certainly hope so, sir.

259
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,078
Mr. President,
I have to ask you something now

260
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:14,914
because we may not
have time later.

261
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:16,416
What is it?

262
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,786
We may find ourselves
in a situation

263
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:22,825
where we have Heller's location
but can't extract him safely.

264
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,628
If that's the case,

265
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:26,731
would you authorize,
in advance,

266
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,165
an all-out assault?

267
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:31,872
The assumption being that
the Secretary would not survive?

268
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:35,110
Correct.

269
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,648
We'll cross that bridge
if the scenario presents itself.

270
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,317
Yes, sir.

271
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,485
Good-bye, Erin.

272
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:49,730
Manning.

273
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,232
Hey, Curtis.
It's Maryanne.

274
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,334
Look, I know you're busy
with the Heller kidnapping.

275
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:54,736
Yes, I am.

276
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:56,272
My friend Aileen said
you're calling in

277
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,043
level-five consultants today
because you're overloaded there.

278
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,111
We added some personnel
because of the crisis.

279
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:01,747
She said you struck
my name from the list.

280
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,049
Why?

281
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,851
You don't meet
the criteria, Maryanne.

282
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,319
Don't give me that,
Curtis.

283
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,256
I have the qualifications
and I have the clearance.

284
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:09,358
Why'd you exclude me?

285
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,960
All right, you want it straight?

286
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:12,830
I don't think we'd work
very well together.

287
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:14,932
Why? Because we slept together
a few times

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,333
and you stopped calling me?

289
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:17,536
I stopped calling you

290
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:18,738
because I realized
you were using me

291
00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:20,808
to get ahead
in your career.

292
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,276
That's your
interpretation, Curtis.

293
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,647
And you didn't seem to have
a problem with it at the time.

294
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:26,315
I'm not going to have
this conversation.

295
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:28,185
Fine, I'll have it
with Erin Driscoll.

296
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:30,922
Maryanne... Consulting with
CTU would be a huge opportunity

297
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:32,223
for me, Curtis.

298
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,459
And I'm not going to let you
get in the way

299
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:35,196
because you're uncomfortable.

300
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,401
Where should I post
those FBI bulletins?

301
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:40,970
At two-three.

302
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:57,227
O'Brian.

303
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:58,494
Chloe, it's me.
Can you talk?

304
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,164
Jack, what the hell happened
with Andrew?

305
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:01,264
Someone got to him

306
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,366
before we could
pick him up.

307
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,735
Did you tell
anyone at CTU

308
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,438
where we were supposed to meet him? No.

309
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:06,472
What are you doing,
Jack?

310
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:07,707
Driscoll just announced

311
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,309
you're operating
outside her authority.

312
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:10,377
I don't have a choice,

313
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:11,746
she's not handling this
the right way.

314
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,282
What if you're wrong?
I'm not.

315
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,118
This is the best chance we have
of finding Secretary Heller.

316
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,788
Jack, if anything happens
to Andrew...

317
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,322
Chloe, I'm doing the best I can,

318
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,458
but right now our first priority
is to find these terrorists.

319
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,361
So why are you calling me?

320
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,064
The hostile's headed
towards the canyons.

321
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,666
I'm going to need
satellite surveillance

322
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,335
to help me track them
without being seen.

323
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:29,371
You want me to steal
satellite bandwidth from CTU,

324
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:30,573
without anyone knowing?
Yes.

325
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,877
Where are you?

326
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:35,547
I'm on Orchard Road
just north of the 14

327
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:39,386
about four miles east
of Valencia.

328
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,354
Okay, Caltrans has traffic cams
in the area,

329
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,925
but you will need
satellite coverage

330
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:44,459
once he gets
closer to the canyons.

331
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:46,562
Call me back as soon as
you've got the coverage.

332
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,132
I'll keep a private
channel open. I will.

333
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,302
Who was that?

334
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:52,370
It was personal.

335
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,049
Something wrong?

336
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,218
I'm not sure.

337
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:03,153
Chloe's acting kind of strange.

338
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:04,856
That's nothing new.

339
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,242
Hey, what do you need?

340
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,642
I just got off the phone

341
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,612
with Maryanne Taylor.

342
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,148
Erin, whatever she told you,

343
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,951
it's coming from
a very disturbed place.

344
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,254
That may be.

345
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,156
But she's as qualified
as any of the others

346
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:30,391
you brought in today.

347
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,961
I'm not comfortable
working with her.

348
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:34,030
That should be
enough for you.

349
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,232
Normally it would be.

350
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,302
However, she mentioned
that your pillow talk

351
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,673
included a synopsis of
the new data mining protocols.

352
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,008
That's a lie.

353
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,644
If she got
that information,

354
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,046
it was from
someone else.

355
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,682
Now she's using it
against me.

356
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:49,386
She knows details
about the new UVX system.

357
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:52,324
That's classified
information.

358
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:54,393
She could force us into
a section one security reboot

359
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,396
and drag us through
a six-month investigation.

360
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:58,498
I don't believe this.

361
00:15:58,565 --> 00:15:59,967
I asked her to come in.

362
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,738
Deal with it.

363
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,513
Do you have the results
on Secretary Heller's son yet?

364
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,715
Yeah.

365
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,355
The polygraph makes
clear he didn't have any

366
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,624
knowing involvement
in his father's kidnapping.

367
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,460
But...?

368
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:19,528
He's still insisting

369
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,930
he didn't tell anyone

370
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,466
his father was coming
to his house this morning.

371
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:25,470
The polygraph was
inconclusive on that claim.

372
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,006
You think he's lying?

373
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,140
It's possible.

374
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,676
Richard was the
only one who knew

375
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,511
where his father
would be this morning.

376
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,449
And he may have told
someone about it.

377
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:37,787
Why would Richard protect
somebody who's betrayed him?

378
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,359
Because he's too arrogant to
believe that's what's happened.

379
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,667
It'll take days to go through

380
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:47,968
his phone records.

381
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:49,270
I want you to see

382
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,207
if you can get the name
out of him another way.

383
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:52,541
What do you mean?

384
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,744
You know what I mean.

385
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,951
Erin, we're not even sure
if he's guilty of anything.

386
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,820
This is how we'll find out.

387
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,022
Get started.

388
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:49,956
Did Father talk to you
about Debbie?

389
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:51,325
What about her?

390
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,835
When Dad told me to take
the briefcase to Omar...

391
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,072
Debbie followed me.

392
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,276
She didn't know
where I was going.

393
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:04,945
She just wanted to talk.

394
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,615
Debbie saw the warehouse
where we're holding Heller?

395
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,050
Yes.

396
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:11,019
But there wasn't anything
I could do about it.

397
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,457
You could have broken up
with her months ago

398
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,460
like your father and I
told you to.

399
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,694
I know I made a mistake,

400
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,231
but Father found out
she was with me

401
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,133
and now he wants me
to get her over here.

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,035
You know
what that means.

403
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,271
If he thinks

404
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,773
there's the slightest chance

405
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,642
she could expose
what we're doing...

406
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:33,051
I didn't realize you felt
so strongly about her.

407
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:36,990
She's not going

408
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:38,560
to mess anything up,
I swear to you.

409
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:46,703
What do you want me to do?

410
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,641
Talk to him.

411
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,546
He'll listen to you.

412
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:52,679
Please.

413
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:56,518
Okay.

414
00:18:56,586 --> 00:19:00,224
Your father's
on his way to a meeting.

415
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,293
I'll try to reach him.

416
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,436
Thanks, Mom.

417
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:32,034
When can I
get out of here?

418
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,634
Secure him.

419
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,567
What the hell are you doing?!

420
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,167
Get your hands off me!

421
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,734
Who else knew your father

422
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,501
would be at your house
this morning?

423
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,933
I told you, no one.

424
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:06,933
What, are you crazy?

425
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,234
CURTIS: This works on the
neurotransmitter level.

426
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,267
It makes every nerve
ending in your body

427
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,601
feel like it's on fire.

428
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:13,833
You're bluffing.

429
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,867
You know you can't
get away with this.

430
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,234
And by the time
you're released,

431
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,668
the mark on your arm
will be gone.

432
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,234
It'll just be your word
against mine.

433
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:23,401
My father is the Secretary
of Defense, for God's sake.

434
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:24,933
I thought you hated him.

435
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,334
Now he's dear old dad?

436
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,234
Help me!

437
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,634
Somebody!

438
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,000
Please!

439
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,434
Help me!

440
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:45,567
Stop.

441
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,367
I can't do it, Erin.

442
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,900
I'm not going to let Eric
work on Richard Heller.

443
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,401
Why not? Maybe he's protecting a friend,

444
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,367
but he wasn't knowingly
involved with the terrorist.

445
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:19,434
It's an inappropriate
use of force.

446
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,534
I gave you an order.

447
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,067
Then give it to me
in writing, Erin.

448
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,668
What are you
suggesting, Curtis,

449
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,167
that we release him?
No.

450
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:29,900
I've seen good results
with sensory disorientation.

451
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:32,301
Cut off his sight,
saturate his auditory.

452
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,000
It's noninvasive.

453
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:37,601
Fine.

454
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:39,634
Try it.

455
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,234
Yes?

456
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,768
DINA:
I just spoke with Behrooz.

457
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,601
He told me about the problem
with his girlfriend.

458
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:47,768
He's very upset, Navi.

459
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:50,000
That's what concerns me.

460
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:53,000
He has feelings for this girl,
despite what he tells us.

461
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,601
Now she's seen the warehouse.

462
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:55,734
I know.

463
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,067
It's very troubling.

464
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,534
I told him to get
her over to the house

465
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,534
so we can question her.
Did he make the call?

466
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,867
No, he asked me
to talk to you instead.

467
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,134
Hmm.

468
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,534
Go upstairs.

469
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,833
What are we going to do?

470
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,234
Are you talking
to Father?

471
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,634
I'll talk to you soon.

472
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,501
You'll take care of this?

473
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,534
Yes.

474
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,301
Thank you.

475
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,768
What did he say?

476
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:24,534
Do I still have to call
Debbie and get her over here?

477
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,167
No.

478
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,000
Thank you, Mom.

479
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,833
I'm going to pull over soon,
and we're going to talk,

480
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,734
okay?

481
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:58,034
Good.

482
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,668
There's some things
I need you to know.

483
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:05,668
Today is not about me or you.

484
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,668
It's about something bigger.

485
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,200
What I need to know
with certainty,

486
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,234
is that whatever you saw
on the Internet

487
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:16,467
will not interfere
with what we have planned.

488
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:19,134
You have to convince me of that.

489
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,334
Yeah?

490
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:09,933
It's going to be a while
on the satellite.

491
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,267
Ever since Heller was taken,
the load is through the roof.

492
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,933
How much longer?
I'm not sure yet.

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
What is your current
position exactly?

494
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,467
I need it to
update the request.

495
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:19,833
Suspect pulled over
just past mile marker 31.

496
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,668
What did he get off for?
There's nothing there.

497
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,668
I don't know, Chloe.
I've got to go!

498
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:26,200
Get back to me as soon as you've
got the satellite coverage.

499
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,367
Jack, I'm watching this.

500
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:38,434
How?

501
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:39,734
On Caltrans' traffic cam.

502
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,134
You've got to stop this.

503
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,067
If I intercede right now,
we lose our opportunity

504
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:45,100
to find Secretary Heller.

505
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,401
What did you
tell CTU?

506
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,467
That someone was
preparing to distribute

507
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,668
some kind of positioning
code on the Internet.

508
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:51,833
What else?

509
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,200
I tried to dig deeper,

510
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:55,833
but everything was in
some kind of Arabic.

511
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
I couldn't read it.

512
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:00,434
That's all you told CTU?

513
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,167
Yes. I promise.

514
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:06,933
Ah!

515
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,567
Are you sure?

516
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,301
Jack, stop them, just stop them.

517
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,401
That's all I know.
I swear, I promise.

518
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:17,301
Please, just don't
hit me anymore.

519
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,501
Please.

520
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:29,234
I talked to the programmer.

521
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,634
I don't think there's a problem.

522
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:31,768
He didn't tell CTU enough

523
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,301
for them to be able to stop us.

524
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:34,900
Are you sure?

525
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,933
Yes. He only got a brief
glimpse of the code.

526
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,200
He was never logged on
to our server.

527
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,501
I need you here.
Get back on the road.

528
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,067
Have them see what else
they can find out,

529
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,967
and then get rid
of the body.

530
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:48,000
I will see you soon.

531
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:58,134
Chloe, how do you open
a secure pipe to Division?

532
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,100
Ask Edgar.

533
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,267
I did. He's busy.

534
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:01,867
Well, I'm busy, too.

535
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,067
Why are you always so
impatient with everybody?

536
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:06,768
Not everybody, just you.
Now please go away.

537
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,100
Bitch.

538
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,933
Jack, what's happening?

539
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,601
The hostile's moving.
I've got to follow him.

540
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:19,768
Jack, you can't leave

541
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,401
Andrew there;
they'll kill him.

542
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:22,768
Jack?

543
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,467
Jack, please.

544
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,034
Jack.

545
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:01,501
Jack?

546
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,100
Jack?

547
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,900
Yeah.

548
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,501
Is Andrew alive?

549
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,367
Yes. Dispatch an ambulance
to this location.

550
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:15,334
Get me the damn
satellite coverage!

551
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,434
That's right, just off the road
next to the 31-mile marker.

552
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,501
Please get there
as fast as you can.

553
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:51,634
What's wrong?

554
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,799
When the trial begins,

555
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:02,495
you may have
an opportunity to escape.

556
00:30:02,563 --> 00:30:07,293
You have to take it,
even if it's dangerous.

557
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,058
Maybe we'll have
a chance before then.

558
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:13,790
They're never going to take
their eyes off of me.

559
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:16,256
It has to be
when their attention

560
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:19,319
is on the trial.

561
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:21,719
I don't want to get
out of here without...

562
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,518
Forget about me.

563
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:26,250
You have to take every chance.

564
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:28,115
Promise me.

565
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:30,614
Dad, I-I... I ca...

566
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,379
Yes, you can. You can.

567
00:30:32,446 --> 00:30:33,879
I want you to live

568
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:38,176
your life, a full life.

569
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:40,574
I want you to have a family.

570
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,772
That's all
I care about.

571
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:48,402
You're my baby.

572
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:52,567
I can't do it.

573
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:55,266
Yes, you can.
You can do it.

574
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,364
Come on now.

575
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,915
Chloe, you want me
to get that?

576
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,182
No.

577
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:27,414
O'Brian.

578
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:28,814
Chloe, it's me.

579
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:31,712
I was just looking
at the C.H.P. dispatch report.

580
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:33,877
Andrew is in really bad shape.

581
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,610
I will never forgive you.

582
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:36,943
Do you hear me?

583
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,441
Chloe, I understand
how you feel, but you've

584
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:39,707
got to think
through this clearly.

585
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,240
We have terrorists on U.S. soil.

586
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:43,405
They've bombed a train,
and they've kidnapped

587
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:44,938
the Secretary of Defense.

588
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,570
Right now our only chance is
to follow this hostile and hope

589
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,203
that he leads us
to Secretary Heller.

590
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:52,134
No, I'm not listening
to you anymore. This is over.

591
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,932
I'm going to Driscoll. No, you won't,
Chloe, because you know I'm right.

592
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,831
No, I don't.

593
00:31:57,897 --> 00:32:00,096
Chloe, if you didn't
believe in what I was doing,

594
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:02,161
you'd have turned
me in already.

595
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:11,488
I hate that this
is happening.

596
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:12,822
So do I.

597
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,287
Chloe, I can't do
this without you.

598
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,285
I need your help to stop them.

599
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:20,284
Chloe.

600
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,450
What?

601
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:23,816
Are you with me?

602
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:28,313
Yeah.

603
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,611
I'll call you as soon
as I have the satellite.

604
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:32,044
Thank you.

605
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:33,711
Yeah.

606
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:45,370
Miss Driscoll,

607
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,769
this is Maryanne Taylor.

608
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:48,734
Thank you.
Hi, Miss Taylor.

609
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,167
I'm very excited to have this
opportunity to help you here.

610
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:53,198
Hello, Curtis.

611
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,531
Maryanne.

612
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,396
Curtis, take Maryanne
to an empty station,

613
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:57,630
and get her started

614
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,262
on the data sorts.

615
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:04,126
Let's go.

616
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:08,322
You'll be working
over here.

617
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,855
You know, Curtis,
I didn't want

618
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,987
to go over your head,
but you left me no choice.

619
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:15,919
Is that so?

620
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,084
I'll let it go
if you will.

621
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:21,282
Get to work,
Maryanne.

622
00:33:33,243 --> 00:33:34,509
Is there a problem?

623
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:35,908
No. Why?

624
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,272
What are you working on?

625
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,405
Division protocol manifest.

626
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:43,269
I need you to build a firewall
around station four.

627
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:45,069
Who's that?

628
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:46,635
Her name
is Maryanne.

629
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:47,734
I just want to make sure

630
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:48,867
she doesn't stray outside

631
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:49,833
the area of her
assignment.

632
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,999
Fine.

633
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:56,429
Chloe, what's going on?
O'Brian.

634
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:58,228
I don't think
I can do this, Jack.

635
00:33:58,294 --> 00:33:59,227
Why, what's
the matter?

636
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:00,360
Curtis has me
spread too thin,

637
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,358
and I've got to get you a satellite

638
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:03,592
on an overloaded
system.

639
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,357
I need more time. We
don't have more time.

640
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:07,355
In five minutes we're
going to be coming up

641
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:08,889
on Route 11.
It's a two-lane road.

642
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:10,022
We'll be
the only cars for miles.

643
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:11,720
There's no way I can follow him

644
00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:12,853
without being seen.

645
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,752
All right.
I think I know

646
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,350
a way I can speed this up.

647
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,616
I'll get back to you.

648
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,702
Chloe, the satellite subsystem
tanked

649
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,834
and Driscoll wants these
updates, like, now.

650
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:47,699
Okay, I'll be right there.

651
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,761
I hope Driscoll
doesn't get too upset.

652
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:57,961
She really overreacts
sometimes.

653
00:34:58,028 --> 00:34:59,959
Oh, this happened
to me a few days ago.

654
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:01,592
You can retrieve
all your files

655
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:03,757
from the auto backups
in the server room.

656
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:05,990
Good idea.

657
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:29,043
Yeah?

658
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:30,709
All right, I managed
to steal you a block of time,

659
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,573
but there's no
continuous coverage

660
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:33,807
in the area you're in.

661
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:35,638
I'll have to order
a reposition.

662
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:36,738
Fine, then do it.
Hold on.

663
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,770
Looks like
we're catching a break.

664
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:40,803
He's pulling into a gas station.

665
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,335
I hope he stays there a while,

666
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:44,334
'cause this is going
to take some time.

667
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,933
Get back to me
as soon as you got it.

668
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:47,266
Okay, I will.

669
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:15,468
You're Edgar, right?
Yeah.

670
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:16,768
Hi, I'm Maryanne Taylor.

671
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:18,135
Erin Driscoll asked me
to come in

672
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:19,270
and help on
data logistics.

673
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:21,004
Yeah, I heard something
about that. Hi.

674
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:23,739
Hi. So, um, can you do me
a favor?

675
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,708
A favor?

676
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:27,274
Yeah, you know,
everyone's really busy

677
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,842
and I just feel like
I'd be more useful

678
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,543
if I had an overall
on what's going on today.

679
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:33,311
The Secretary of Defense
has been kidnapped.

680
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:34,979
I know that.
I mean tactically.

681
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:36,814
I really don't have time
for this. I'm a little busy.

682
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,213
Why don't you
just give me

683
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,481
the main points, okay?

684
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:40,949
All right,
we think Jack Bauer

685
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:42,683
is following one
of the terrorists.

686
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:44,518
We think? Yeah, it's a
little loose right now.

687
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,720
He's off on his own doing
this, and we can't find him.

688
00:36:46,786 --> 00:36:48,554
I thought Bauer didn't
even work here anymore.

689
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:49,988
He doesn't.

690
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:51,722
Driscoll gave him the
authority to do this one thing.

691
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:53,255
All right.

692
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:55,058
Thanks, Edgar.

693
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:44,619
Richard...

694
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:48,455
how long do you think it's been?

695
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:49,989
What?

696
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:53,592
How long do you think you've
been sitting here like this?

697
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,360
Three, four hours.

698
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:07,265
It's been less
than 30 minutes.

699
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,200
Time is the first thing
you lose track of

700
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:10,501
with sensory
disorientation.

701
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,036
And it only gets worse.

702
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:15,437
This is illegal!

703
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:18,072
You can't keep me here.

704
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,141
You'll be here until you tell me
what I need to know.

705
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:23,042
I told you everything I know!

706
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:25,176
Your father was kidnapped
by terrorists.

707
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:27,811
Our polygraph analysis tells us
that you're hiding something

708
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:29,111
that might help us find him.

709
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:31,613
Just tell me
what it is

710
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:34,314
and all this stops.

711
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,515
You're not going to do this.

712
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,215
If you don't care enough
about your father

713
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,483
to tell me what
I need to know,

714
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:41,218
I'll get it out of you this way.

715
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:54,492
You're not going
to do this!

716
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,895
Please!

717
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:58,594
No!

718
00:38:58,662 --> 00:39:01,997
You're not going
to do this!

719
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:10,903
Stop it! Stop it!

720
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:27,411
O'Brian.

721
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,013
What's your time frame
on the reposition?

722
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,780
Suspect's going to be headed
back out on the road

723
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,649
any minute.
My request's still in the queue.

724
00:39:32,716 --> 00:39:34,650
Chloe, we've got to get that
satellite coverage up and running now.

725
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:36,784
There's nothing I can do.
You're going to have to find

726
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,685
a way to keep him from
getting back on the road.

727
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,720
It's going to take as long
as it takes. Just hurry.

728
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:42,353
Okay, I will.

729
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,729
Why is Debbie here?

730
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,261
What did you do?

731
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:01,065
I called her and asked her to come over.

732
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,665
You said that
you would help me.

733
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,265
That you talked
to Father.

734
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,667
Your father's right.

735
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:08,235
We need to find out who
she told about this morning.

736
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:10,204
I told you
she didn't see anything!

737
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,504
Then there shouldn't be
any problem.

738
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:13,538
What did you say
to her?

739
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:14,805
I told her

740
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,239
that I was concerned
about the two of you

741
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:17,373
and that I wanted to help.

742
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:19,408
Mom...

743
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:20,442
Behrooz,

744
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:23,744
you know what's at stake.

745
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:26,213
You do as you're told,
understand?

746
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:37,186
Debbie, thank you
for coming.

747
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:38,186
Sure.

748
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:41,888
Hi.

749
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,523
Come in.

750
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,992
Debbie, please.

751
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,560
Make yourself comfortable
in the living room.

752
00:40:51,627 --> 00:40:53,862
I'll make tea.

753
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:01,933
Hi.
Hey.

754
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,134
I'm glad
your mom called.

755
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:04,734
If she and your dad
have problems

756
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:07,103
with us being together,
we should talk about it.

757
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,937
Debbie...

758
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:11,105
What's wrong?

759
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:12,739
You don't understand.

760
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:14,808
You shouldn't have come here.

761
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:19,309
Why do you always
say things like that?

762
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:49,760
Damn it.

763
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:52,729
O'Brian.

764
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:54,631
Chloe, what's your bottom line?
Am I going to have

765
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,465
satellite coverage
in the next minute or two?

766
00:41:56,532 --> 00:41:57,565
I'm sorry, Jack.

767
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,168
It's going to take
at least another five.

768
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:01,934
That's too long. That's
the best I can do.

769
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:05,036
Damn it. I'm going to have to figure
out a way to keep this guy here.

770
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:06,237
Keep working on it.
Okay, I will.

771
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,967
Everybody put your hands up now!
You, Don't move!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
