1
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:14,087
You killed Tariq?

2
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:16,187
You can't let Father know.

3
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:18,553
He wants me dead, because
I messed up with Debbie.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,553
You were determined to kill him,
to kill our own son.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,020
Nothing will stand
in the way of what

6
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:29,054
needs to be done-
not him, not you.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,653
Your father's
following us.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,887
What?

9
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:33,787
It was the only way
I could save you.

10
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:34,787
<i>( gunshot )</i>

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,854
Oh, God! Oh, God!

12
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:40,357
I think I got it.

13
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,150
This is really it.
I can turn off the override

14
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,386
and stop the remaining plants
from melting down.

15
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,453
<i>Did the best I could, sir.
I hope it works.</i>

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,221
So do I.

17
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,753
Edgar, what's going on?

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,054
Why are some of the reactors
still not shutting down?

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,353
Six of the reactors were immune
to the kill sequence.

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,753
Contact Bauer. Either he
finds the people responsible

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,920
for planning
the override,

22
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:02,420
or we're looking
at a nuclear holocaust.

23
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:05,020
Bauer and Audrey Raines left
here about five minutes ago.

24
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:06,221
Where'd they go?

25
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:07,687
Falstead Security.

26
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:10,154
You're going to need to set
things up on your end.

27
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,820
When Jack Bauer
and Audrey Raines

28
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:15,386
are killed, CTU is going
to know that someone inside

29
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:17,787
leaked their location.
Divert suspicion.

30
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,087
Fine.

31
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:21,187
The override device
maintains heat levels

32
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:22,987
within the reactor.
They can melt down

33
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,486
every one of
those power plants.

34
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:26,720
The man you saw when you
were being held captive,

35
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,386
right now he's
our only lead.

36
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:31,087
Stop there.
I think that's him.

37
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:32,486
They're trying
to seal us off.

38
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:33,887
Well, shouldn't we call CTU?

39
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:35,420
No. CTU's gotta
be compromised.

40
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,386
That's the only way
they'd know we were here.

41
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:38,553
Then who are you calling?

42
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,386
The only person
I can trust right now.

43
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:44,054
I'm empty.

44
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,154
<i>( screams )
Jack.</i>

45
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:50,254
JACK:
Tony!

46
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,486
Is there any chance
this is a mistake?

47
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,187
For the remaining six
nuclear reactors,

48
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,787
Arch is taking longer
to shut down.

49
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:04,120
No. I can recheck it.

50
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:06,187
Those plants are firmly
in the grip of the override,

51
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:07,486
which has been sealed off.

52
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:08,486
We can't get at it.

53
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:09,954
Did you send a
list of the six

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,020
affected cities to the
President? Yes, sir.

55
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:13,620
What about evacuation
procedures?

56
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:15,486
We've already alerted
the National Guard.

57
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,587
We're just
waiting to see

58
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,254
how the President
wants us to proceed.

59
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:21,553
Miss Driscoll,
President's ready.

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,087
Okay, put him on.

61
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,353
Mr. President.

62
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,720
I understand we've
been able to shut down

63
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:28,087
98 nuclear power plants.

64
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,587
Yes, sir,

65
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:32,987
but as of now, it appears
that our shutdown order will not

66
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:35,920
be effective with the
six remaining reactors.

67
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,553
Not going to be effective?

68
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,287
What exactly does that mean?

69
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm afraid it means
that we could have

70
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,787
six nuclear disasters
on our hands.

71
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:51,321
What are the casualty
projections if all six plants...

72
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,687
melt down?

73
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:54,854
450,000 deaths in
the first 24 hours.

74
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,620
The long-range estimate's
in the low millions,

75
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,620
and that's not
taking into account

76
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,987
the resulting cancers
and birth defects.

77
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,887
Why were we able to shut down

78
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:06,587
the other power plants,
but not these six?

79
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,787
It's because they're still

80
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,620
being controlled
by the terrorists, sir.

81
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,087
You mean because
of the override device

82
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,087
that they stole today?

83
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,386
Exactly.

84
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,954
We have to find
the override device itself.

85
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,221
It's a prototype,
and the terrorists

86
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,321
have the only
one in the world.

87
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:20,353
All right,
then let's find it.

88
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,587
I'm going to order the
evacuation of those six cities.

89
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,420
Jim, keep me posted.

90
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:27,221
Yes, Mr. President.

91
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:28,687
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

92
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:31,054
All right, let's
get back to work.

93
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,386
Yeah.

94
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,221
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.

95
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:36,287
Don't let anyone know

96
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:37,420
you're talking to me.

97
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:38,420
We got a problem.

98
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,653
I understand, Marcy.

99
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,154
Let me see what I can do.

100
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,720
I have to take this call.

101
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:43,787
Yes, sir.

102
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,620
What's going on?

103
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,653
First off, sir,
I want you

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,954
to know
that Audrey and I

105
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,854
are safe, but there was an
attempt made on our life

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,254
at Falstead Security.
What?

107
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,887
A group of assassins, well
armed, well trained, took out

108
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:56,987
our entire
security detail.

109
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,753
You're gonna need to
send a forensic unit

110
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,386
over to identify the
bodies, but I don't

111
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,486
want anyone at
CTU to know.

112
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:02,687
Why not?

113
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:03,954
Because I think someone

114
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
over at CTU
is complicit in the attack.

115
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,020
<i>How do you know that?</i>

116
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,287
Sir, CTU is the only agency
that knew where we were.

117
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,187
No one else
had that information.

118
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,054
Is one of Erin's people
working with the terrorists?

119
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,221
Yes, I think so.

120
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:20,820
I just don't know who,
but it's clear

121
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,154
that they didn't want Audrey

122
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,687
to make the I.D.
of the man she saw

123
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,321
when you guys
were both being held.

124
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:28,386
I'm sending a Secret Service
detail to pick you two up.

125
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:29,486
Sir, please
don't do that.

126
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,120
That's not the right
thing to do here.

127
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,187
Why not?
I don't want

128
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,720
anyone to know
where we are.

129
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:35,287
That way,
I know we'll be safe.

130
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:37,620
How do you want me
to handle this?

131
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:38,987
Remember the sequence
we developed

132
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:40,120
for the Melbourne situation?

133
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:41,420
Yes.

134
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,420
Try that. I think it'll work.

135
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:44,753
Okay.

136
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,486
Sir, I've got to go.
I'll get back to you

137
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,854
as soon as I know we're safe.

138
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,420
Jack, take care of Audrey.

139
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:53,386
Yes, sir, I will.

140
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,353
You okay?

141
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm almost
getting used to this.

142
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:04,920
Yeah.

143
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:06,154
Tony, is it possible

144
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,724
that we could
have been followed?

145
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:09,257
No. We're clear.

146
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:10,980
Where are we going?

147
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,954
We need to lay low for a while.

148
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,453
What kind of communication
do you need?

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
A wi-fi and a hard line.

150
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,287
All right,
we'll go back to my place.

151
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,720
Okay.

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,954
Thank you, Tony.

153
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,987
Wait till you see it
before you thank me.

154
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:30,854
No, I mean for picking us up,
saving our lives.

155
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm sure you're wondering
what's going on.

156
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:38,020
Not really, no.

157
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:40,687
Something wrong?

158
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,753
What could be wrong?

159
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,687
I'm not in
the federal prison anymore,

160
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:46,420
thanks to you
and President Palmer.

161
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:48,187
Michelle left me.

162
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:49,453

00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:52,687
You know what? Never mind.

165
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,887
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

166
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,453
You heard about Audrey and
her father this morning.

167
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,687
Yeah.

168
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,520
We were at Falstead Security
so Audrey

169
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:01,987
could make an I.D.
of a man she saw

170
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:03,120
during the kidnapping.

171
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:04,587
I don't get it. Why?

172
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:06,453
The secretary's kidnapping
was just a cover.

173
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,820
The terrorists' main objective
is to gain control

174
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:10,987
of American power plants
from coast to coast.

175
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,987
The man that Audrey saw
is our only lead.

176
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,154
I thought you weren't in
the field anymore, Jack.

177
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,187
I'm not.

178
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,787
The secretary is
my responsibility.

179
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,854
I got caught up in it.

180
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,587
Yeah, well, listen
to me very carefully.

181
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:24,154
I don't want
to get caught up in it.

182
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,120
So you do whatever
you need to do at my place.

183
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm staying out
of it, all right?

184
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,187
Understood.

185
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:37,553
Today continues to be
a challenge to the strength

186
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,187
of the American spirit.

187
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:44,187
We have a condition in six
cities across the United States

188
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:47,887
in which nuclear power
facilities may become unstable.

189
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:50,920
While we work to regain control
over these facilities,

190
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:53,787
I am also asking
our National Guard to assist

191
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:58,120
local authorities to affect
an immediate evacuation

192
00:06:58,187 --> 00:06:59,287
of those six cities.

193
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,087
This evacuation is only

194
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,020
being issued for all persons

195
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,221
living or working...

196
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:05,887
The President didn't
mention the fact

197
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:07,321
that there isn't
enough time left

198
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,520
for a complete
evacuation.

199
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:11,386
If those reactors
melt down,

200
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:14,787
there are gonna be at least
50,000 dead per city.

201
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:16,854
We still have time
to try and find

202
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,221
a way to prevent that.

203
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,653
I can tell
you now, Erin,

204
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,486
the chances of doing that
from here are very low.

205
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:24,520
We have to find
the people who have

206
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,787
the override device.

207
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:31,087
What about the hospitals
north of there?

208
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,787
All right. Keep checking.

209
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,787
Called Dina's sister.

210
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:36,987
There's no answer.

211
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:38,587
All right, I'll take care of it.

212
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:39,653
You and Rafi go check

213
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
the station again.

214
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:42,787
Okay.

215
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,687
The Americans have been able to
shut down most of the reactors.

216
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:48,954
How many are under our control?

217
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,854
Six.

218
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,254
More than enough
to break their will,

219
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,787
but I'm gonna have to manage
the override personally,

220
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,787
make sure those six
melt down on schedule.

221
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:00,187
Is there anything I can do?

222
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:01,587
Yes.

223
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:02,920
Take care of your mess.

224
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:05,321
Don't worry, Madwan.

225
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:06,753
I give you my word.

226
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,653
My wife and son will be dead
by the end of this day.

227
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,653
<i>( groaning )</i>

228
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,587
We have to get you
to a hospital.

229
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,753
No. Your father knows
I've been shot.

230
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,987
He'll be looking for us
in all the hospitals.

231
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:31,154
Well, we're going
to have to take a chance.

232
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,187
Mom, you're hurt.

233
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:33,520
I'll be okay.

234
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:34,887
You won't.

235
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:36,820
You need to
get to a doctor.

236
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:38,653
I'm not afraid of Father.

237
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,854
You should be.

238
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,154
He tried to kill me,

239
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,653
and then he did this to you.

240
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,087
He is not my father anymore.

241
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:47,386
<i>( groaning )</i>

242
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:51,553
Mom, please.

243
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:54,653
All right.

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,154
Drop me off
at an emergency room,

245
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,553
but then you have
to drive away.

246
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,486
No. Whatever happens,
we're staying together.

247
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,154
Jackie, I'm running
a filter for Driscoll.

248
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:13,553
Could you baby-sit
it for a sec?

249
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,720
I'll be right back.
Sure.

250
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,154
Yes, Marianne.

251
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,287
I couldn't take your call.

252
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,587
I was in a meeting.

253
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,087
Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines
are still alive.

254
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,753
My information was accurate.

255
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,486
Yes. The location was correct,
but they survived the attack.

256
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,820
Are they headed back to CTU?

257
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,154
I haven't heard anything.

258
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,386
Bauer didn't call in?

259
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:01,254
Not that I'm aware of.

260
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,920
That doesn't make sense.

261
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,887
<i>( sighs ) Actually,
it makes perfect sense.</i>

262
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,820
Bauer knows there's
been a security breach,

263
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,620
and you can bet
he's told someone here.

264
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:09,653
I gotta get out.

265
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,087
No, you are to stay in

266
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,753
until we take care
of Bauer and the woman.

267
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,553
What about me? I
am not gonna spend

268
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,020
the rest of my
life in jail.

269
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,753
You'll be taken care of.

270
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,520
You know that. Now go.

271
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,154
There you are.

272
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:29,486
What do you need?

273
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,020
Division is waiting

274
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,486
for those projections.

275
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,887
Well, they're ready to be sent.

276
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,520
Well, then, send them.

277
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>( knocking )</i>

278
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,486
Yeah.

279
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:50,187
Sir, your assistant,
Scott Borman, just arrived.

280
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:51,753
Should I sent him in? Yeah.

281
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,520
Thanks.

282
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:58,353
Mr. Secretary, it's good to see
you safe and sound, sir.

283
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,920
Thanks, Scott. Sit down.

284
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:03,753
Is there a problem, sir?

285
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,720
There's a big problem.

286
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:09,020
Someone inside CTU
is leaking information

287
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:10,321
to someone
on the outside.

288
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:11,653
What do you
need me to do?

289
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I need you
to go to Erin Driscoll.

290
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:15,187
Tell her that Jack Bauer

291
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,254
is no longer
at Falstead Security,

292
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,553
that he's watching
the surveillance videos

293
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,187
at an old CTU substation
in Torrance.

294
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:24,420
Anything about
when Jack will call in?

295
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,720
When they identify
the man that Audrey saw.

296
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,120
I take it Jack and Audrey are
nowhere near the CTU substation.

297
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,187
Right. I'm trying
to flush out the mole.

298
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:34,553
Then you'll need me to put

299
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,687
a DOD Comsat envelope
around this place.

300
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:39,486
And if anyone sends out
a communication

301
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:43,520
containing the information
you planted, that's the spy.

302
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,254
Yes, sir.

303
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,920
Let's go.

304
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,067
Let's go.

305
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,367
Watch your step.

306
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,534
The dog next door
likes our yard.

Hey, Jack, it's okay.

313
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,767
This is my friend Jen.

314

Tell him to play
with his guns outside.

315

I'm sorry.

318

What are you doing here,
anyways?

00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,800
I thought
you were working.

Hi.

I-I saw you on TV today.

You're the daughter

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,668
You and your old man were
kidnapped this morning.

328
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,267
Yeah.

329
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,634
What's going on?

330
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,467
I'm helping them out
with something.

331
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,501
Could you be

332
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,501
a little more
specific?

333
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,301
We need to use Tony's computer.

334
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,234
What, they don't have
computers where you work?

335
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,767
Listen, babe,

336
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,867
we have a situation here,
all right?

337
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,934
They need to lie low
for a little bit.

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,568
We can't let anybody know
they're here, all right?

339
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:40,167
Whatever.
I'm leaving anyway.

340
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:41,767
Tony...

341
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,800
Jen, you can't go anywhere.

342
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,733
Why not?

343
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,867
We can't leave

344
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,334
until Jack
and Audrey take off.

345
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,434
We can't take
a chance.

346
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,100
What kind of chance?
I work at a bar.

347
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm sorry, Jen.
We're not gonna be long.

348
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,301
Look, stay as long
as you want.

349
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,301
I have a job.
He doesn't.

350
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,601
Jen, can I talk to you
for a second?

351
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Please?

352
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,767
Sorry.

353
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,733
No, she seems real sweet.

354
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,367
Look, we were fighting
for our lives a few minutes ago,

355
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,733
and if it hadn't been for Tony,
we would have been dead.

356
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,034
Now, I've been
through a lot today,

357
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,733
and I'm sure when
this is all over,

358
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,034
your boss will understand.

359
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
And if he doesn't?

360
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,867
I can have him killed.

361
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,833
Knock yourself out.

362
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,067
Thank you.

363
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:42,267
How are you guys making out
with that?

364
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,767
Good. I just have convert this
so I can read it.

365
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,167
And then, hopefully,

366
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:48,401
you can make an I.D.
from the surveillance video.

367
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,867
I have some software for that.
Let me dig it out.

368
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,867
Thanks.

369
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,867
<i>( quietly ):
You told me about Tony,</i>

370
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,134
but I didn't know
that Michelle left him.

371
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:58,767
Yeah, a few months
after he got out of prison.

372
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,334
<i>I thought he went to prison
because of her.</i>

373
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,668
He saved her life,

374
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,401
and she paid him
back by leaving him?

375
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,833
That's the way
Tony sees it, too.

376
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,534
Didn't happen
exactly like that.

377
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,800
When Tony got out of prison,
he was angry.

378
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,000
He couldn't get a job.

379
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,034
Personally, I don't think
he wanted one.

380
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,700
He started drinking.

381
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:19,700
He pushed her away.

382
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:20,934
What is she doing now?

383
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,534
Deputy director
over at Division.

384
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,401
I hope he can help us.

385
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,267
If he can, he will.

386
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:29,434
All right, here we go.

387
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,434
You got it, Tony?

388
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, I got it
right here.

389
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,967
Thanks.

390
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,501
We're in.

391
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:50,034
Start the ball rolling
with Driscoll?

392
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,201
Yep. Headed into
her briefing now.

393
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,201
She's not gonna be happy
when she finds out

394
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,067
we're using her
to flush out the mole.

395
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:56,401
I am surprised
you felt the need

396
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,067
to keep her in the dark
about this one.

397
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:59,967
As long as there's
a leak in CTU,

398
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:02,301
we keep everyone
in the dark.

399
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,401
Make sure
that you're online

400
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,568
and that your databases
are unlocked.

401
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:16,401
As soon as Jack
sends in the image,

402
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:17,900
I need you to be able

403
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,034
to move as quickly as possible
to make this I.D., okay?

404
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,367
I don't understand

405
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,534
why Jack's doing this
at the old substation.

406
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:23,234
Well, apparently there's
technical reasons.

407
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:24,634
I didn't speak
with him directly.

408
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,668
Who did?

409
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,568
I did.

410
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:29,334
He also asked
that his whereabouts

411
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:31,767
be kept strictly internal
until he contacts us.

412
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,601
All right, let's go.

413
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:12,234
Old CTU substation in Torrance.

414
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,301
I remember this lady.

415
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,700
We saw him around here.

416
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,167
There he is.

417
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,800
You sure that's him?

418
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

419
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,501
I'm gonna route this
through the D.C. office.

420
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,967
Tony, she's on the phone.

421
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:43,000
We can't have her
making calls.

422
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,767
We need the phone.

423
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,167
Go to hell.
I can't go to work.

424
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,467
I can't talk
on the phone?

425
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:52,800
Just give me
the phone.

426
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:53,800
Go to hell!

427
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,000
Give me the
damn phone!

428
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,301
<i>( thud )
( screams )</i>

429
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,634
<i>( typing,
computer blipping )</i>

430
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:05,767
Go ahead.

431
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,401
Thanks.

432
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,634
This is Marcie.

433
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,867
Marcie, it's Jack.

434
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,833
I'm sending you the image
we need I.D.'d.

435
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,267
We're ready to receive.

436
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,501
Okay.

437
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,833
You positive this came
from her system?

438
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,067
Yeah.

439
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:29,934
The voices were digitized
and scrambled,

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,267
but we were able
to clean it up enough

441
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:32,668
to make out the words
"CTU substation. "

442
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:33,733
Where's security?

443
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,767
They're on the way.

444
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,867
Thanks, Scott.

445
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:42,733
Yes, Mr. Secretary?

446
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,733
Erin, I'm sorry
to report

447
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,900
there's been a breach
in CTU.

448
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,334
What?

449
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,367
The information Scott gave you
about Jack is false.

450
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:51,334
What do you mean false?

451
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,434
Jack and Audrey were ambushed
at Falstead Security.

452
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,767
They survived
the attack,

453
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,000
but it's clear that someone
in this office

454
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,100
gave them up.

455
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,534
With all due respect, sir,

456
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,967
you knew about this
and you didn't tell me?

457
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,201
Being left out
of the loop

458
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,800
is not something you
should be concerned about.

459
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,167
I assume you're telling me now

460
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,833
because your sting operation
yielded a result.

461
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,668
Yes, it did.
Read that.

462
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,700
Where is she?

463
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,767
She's being taken
into custody.

464
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,900
Join me.

465
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:09,234
Miss Driscoll, what's going on?

466
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,900
Go with these men.

467
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,601
What for?

468
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,034
You're under arrest, Gavin.

469
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
DRISCOLL: You've been passing
classified information.

470
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,034
What?

471
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:19,867
What are you talking about?

472
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:20,967
Take her to Holding.

473
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:25,434
Miss Driscoll,
what are you doing?

474
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,234
Miss Driscoll,
I haven't done anything.

475
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:29,967
Miss Driscoll,
this is a mistake.

476
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,168
What is happening?

477
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,969
Can someone please tell me
what is going on?

478
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,270
I didn't do anything, please!

479
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,461
Get back to work.

480
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,559
I don't care how
you divide up her files.

481
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:05,225
I just want everything off
her system and then sent to me.

482
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,192
And enter new pass codes.

483
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:08,958
We can't just do this
on your authority.

484
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,659
Edgar...

485
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,325
it's okay.

486
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:14,125
But he works for DOD,
not CTU.

487
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,559
Yeah, well, he's the one
that found the mole, right?

488
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:19,159
And Heller wants him
to have joint authority.

00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,992
Finish up here and get
back to station two.

490
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:23,592
The program we set up
for the reactor

491
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,692
is almost finished compiling.

492
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,025
Can I see this?

493
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:28,426
Sure.

494
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,793
What makes you so sure
Sarah's the mole?

495
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,626
She was sending out encoded
information about Jack Bauer.

496
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:37,626
I don't think she would compromise
Bauer or the investigation.

497
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:40,492
That's how she was able
to fool everybody, Edgar.

498
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,159
She's the last person
you'd expect to do it.

499
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:44,592
All right,
just get me those files.

500
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,426
It's right here.

501
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,459
2:22 p. m. Message sent:

"Old CTU substation
in Torrance. "

503
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:54,092
This doesn't seem
weird to you that she

504
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,426
would leave it
on her system like this?

505
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:57,426
She didn't just leave it;
it was encrypted.

506
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:58,793
Yeah, with
a Bainbridge algorithm.

507
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,726
Come on, it's so old school,
it's like saying,

508
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:01,793
"Please decode me. "

509
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,359
Let's face it,

510
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:06,793
Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife
in the drawer.

Please, Miss Driscoll...

514
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:16,992
I promise you, there's been
some kind of mistake.

515
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:18,359
How could there
be a mistake?

516
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:20,626
Your system was isolated-
the message was sent from it

517
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,992
while you were there.
Somebody set me up.

518
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,459
That's the only explanation
I can think of.

519
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,459
Tell me how that's possible.

520
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,125
Someone backed into my system

521
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:31,092
through a subnet,
planted something.

522
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,559
That's the first thing
we checked.

523
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,925
None of them were compromised.

524
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:36,292
Let's stop playing games.

525
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,626
Thousands of people's
lives are at stake!

Where are the people
who control the override?

527
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,659
I don't know.
That's what I was working on.

528
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:48,159
Who did you send the
message about Jack to?

529
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,159
I didn't.

<i>Miss Driscoll... ( sighs )</i>

You know that.

533
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,659
Was it the same contact
who coordinated the attempt

534
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,859
on Jack and Audrey's life
at Falstead Security?

535

I don't know. It wasn't me.

536
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,426
I learned my
lesson today

537

with Sherrick, and I am
no longer going to err

Do you think you can
break her in time?

I can break her in time,

566
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,159
if she's guilty.

567
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,592
According to Scott,
there is no way

568
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,559
that this could be
a mistake.

569
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,992
I agree it's
hard evidence,

570
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:05,759
but I've known Sarah for eight months,
and she doesn't fit the profile.

571
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:08,893
How do you want
to handle it?

572

I'll watch for
a few more minutes,

then I'll go back in.

Okay, I'll call Marcie, tell
her the CTU channels are open.

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if they called the police.

649

At least the police
could protect us from Father.

00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:50,305
That's what would happen.

653
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:59,604
So where are we going to go
after we leave here?

654
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:01,205
If we can get out
of the city

655
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:03,871
and stay somewhere
for a couple of days,

656
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:07,838
I can arrange for us
to get out of the country.

Yeah?

661
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,071
Jack, it's Marcie.
We got a match.

662
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:25,470
Who is it?

663
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:26,737
Name is Henry Powell.

664
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:28,404
I posted everything
on that secure site.

665
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,238
Hold on a second.

666
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:32,904
<i>( typing )</i>

667
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:34,704
Okay, I got it.

668
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:36,337
He's a computer consultant.

669
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:38,537
He used to work
for McLennen-Forster.

670
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:39,804
Wait a second, McLennen-Forster.

671
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,038
They're the defense contractors

672
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,337
that designed
the override devices

673
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:43,504
controlling the power plants.

674
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:44,971
Yeah, well, he's
not there anymore,

675
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:46,171
but he freelances
for them,

676
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:47,704
and he's definitely
still in L.A.

677
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:50,104
How do you know that? Because
he's trying to leave the city.

678
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:51,771
We just found out he
scheduled a chopper

679
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,305
to meet him in
Van Nuys in 15 minutes.

680
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,971
I thought all air traffic
had been grounded.

681
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,004
It is. He must have
some well-connected friends.

682
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,337
He got a special clearance.

683
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,305
Son of a bitch.
Where in Van Nuys?

684
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,704
The helipad at the Larchmont
Building. Okay, I'm gonna

685
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,671
want you to ground his flight
but not until I get there.

686
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,205
I don't want him
to see me coming.

687
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:07,370
Jack, they're here.

688
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,437
Can you make it in time?
I'm gonna try.

689
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,038
Audrey, get your things.
We got to go.

690
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:20,370
Agent Davis, Secret Service. Jack Bauer.

691
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,637
You're gonna take the secretary's
daughter straight back to CTU.

692
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:23,971
Those are our orders.
Okay.

693
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:25,038
You got a car for me?

694
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,971
It's right over there.

695
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:28,004
Thank you.

696
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:30,004
Audrey, they're ready.

697
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,205
This is Agent Davis. He's
gonna take care of you. Okay.

698
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:34,938
Be careful.

699
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:36,504
I will. You, too.

700
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:44,571
CTU, Patterson.
This is Jack.

701
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,071
Let me speak to Erin Driscoll.

702
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,704
Jack, I just got the file
on Henry Powell.

703
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:52,104
I'm going through it now.

704
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,571
He's trying to leave the city.

705
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,138
I've got to get over
to Van Nuys.

706
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,271
You want air backup?

707
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:58,004
No, I want to keep
a low profile.

708
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:59,437
I don't want to spook him.

709
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:02,004
The soonest I can get you a
ground package is 30 minutes.

710
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:03,171
That's gonna be too long.

711
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:04,470
When is his flight due
to take off?

712
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:05,871
Less than 15 minutes.

713
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,470
What do you want to do, Jack?

714
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:08,838
He's most likely
on his own.

715
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:10,737
I'm gonna have to try
and handle this myself.

716
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:11,771
All right.

717
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,004
I'll send a team anyway.

718
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,205
I'll be in touch.

719
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:16,838
What are you gonna try
and handle by yourself?

720
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:18,404
Don't worry about it.
It's covered.

721
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,038
Jack, it'd be
pretty stupid of me

722
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,571
to let you die right after I
risked my life trying to save you.

723
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,337
Could you use my help?

724
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:29,305
Yeah.

725
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,205
All right, let's go.

726
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,771
Curtis.
Yeah, Edgar?

727
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,704
Has Sarah confessed to anything yet? No.

728
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,205
What are they doing to her?

729
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,305
Don't worry about it.

730
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,904
Just get back to
work, all right?

731
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:22,905
Curtis?
What did Edgar want?

732
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:24,806
Why do you care?

733
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:27,007
Well, you should let him know
we need his full attention-

734
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,294
Get back to your station.

735
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:45,437
What's that?

736
00:33:45,504 --> 00:33:49,104
Just something to numb the arm
so that I can close the wound.

737
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:51,871
Okay.

738
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:54,138
I really wish
you'd let me admit you.

739
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:55,704
This wound is serious.

740
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,771
There's a chance of
an infection here.

741
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,370
No, Doctor, please.

742
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:03,305
Do whatever you can,
and we'll leave.

743
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,637
Behrooz,

744
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:05,938
where are you going?

745
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,337
I'll be right back, Mom.

00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:12,038
you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

748
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:13,904
Dr. Travis...

749
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:19,637
Mom, the police are here.

750
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:21,804
Did you call the police?
This is a gunshot wound.

751
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,071
I told you it wasn't.

752
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:24,671
DOCTOR: Then why are
you acting so strangely?

753
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:26,437
Let's go.

754
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:30,437
You shouldn't leave-
you need to be treated.

755
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:36,238
Wait!

756
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:39,839
Let's go!

757
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,838
Come on...
Come on!

About an hour ago,

763
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:43,790
you asked me to bump up
your security clearance.

764
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:45,256
I was a little busy
with the override,

765
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:46,623
but I finally got it for you.

766
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,489
Great. Thank you.

767
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:54,089
What?

768
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:55,690
You'll need
to pick a password.

769
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:58,423

Edgar.

776
00:36:58,256 --> 00:37:00,189
Why do you keep looking at me?

777
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:01,589
I don't keep looking at you.

Let's
go outside.

I want to talk
to you in private.

780
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,523
I don't want to talk
to you in private.

781
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:06,790
I have a lot of work to do.

782
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:09,623
It is getting
incredibly tedious, Edgar,

783
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,855
to have to remind
you repeatedly

784
00:37:11,922 --> 00:37:13,922
that I could step into
Driscoll's office any moment

785
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:15,056
and have you fired.

786
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,489
Curtis, I need to talk to you.

787
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:26,922
What is it?

788
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:28,356
I need you to walk with me
to Driscoll's office.

789
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:29,690
Walk with you?

790
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,289
Please, Curtis.

791
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:49,556
Sorry
to interrupt.

792
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:50,556
What is it?

793
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,822
You got the wrong person.

794
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:53,222
Sarah's not guilty of anything.

795
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,556
How do you know?

796
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:56,122
Because I just sneaked
into Marianne's system.

797
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:57,656
She used Sarah's to communicate

798
00:37:57,723 --> 00:37:59,523
outside of CTU,
made it look like

799
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:00,523
Sarah was the one.

800
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:02,189
That's not
possible.

801
00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:03,690
Sarah's workstation
was isolated from the subnet.

802
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:05,022
She didn't use the subnet.

803
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:06,222
How'd she get through?

804
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:07,623
She used a plain old
AC power line.

805
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,189
What?

806
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:11,822
That's the last place
anybody would ever look.

807
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,022
Plus it has plenty of bandwidth

808
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,022
to carry
the signal.

809
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,089
Where is she?

810
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:22,389
She's trying to leave
the building.

811
00:38:22,456 --> 00:38:25,056
