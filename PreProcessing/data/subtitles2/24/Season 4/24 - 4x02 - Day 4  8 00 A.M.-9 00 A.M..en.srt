1
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:11,595
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,647
- Excuse me, Ms. Driscoll?
- What is it, Chloe?

3
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:25,234
There was intelligence indicating the possibily of an attack at 8:00 this morning.

4
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:28,029
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,865
by the name of Tomas Sherek was last seen in the city.

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,200
- It's Tomas.
- Did Dar get the briefcase?

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,619
Yes, he's on his way to you now.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,997
So far, everything is on schedule.

9
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,499
The briefcase is on its way to us now.

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,540
When it gets here,

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,584
we'll take it to the warehouse.

12
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,125
What we will accomplish today will change the world.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,380
We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this.

14
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,719
I found something on the Net I think you should know about.

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,720
What?

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,890
I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack.

17
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,893
The thing is that not all the code remarks were in English.

18
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,771
- What language were they in?
- Arabic or Turkish, maybe.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,023
What did you find on the Internet?!

20
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,566
It was my friend, not me!

21
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,860
- What's his name?
- Andrew Paige.

22
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,784
Is it going to be uncomfortable?

23
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:15,910
What?

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,954
Going back to CTU, seeing Driscoll again.

25
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,831
I don't blame her for her decision.

26
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,500
She forced you out of CTU.

27
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,711
I could have joined other agencies if I still wanted to do fieldwork,

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,505
but I didn't.

29
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,048
I know this guy.

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,134
Fortunately for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours.

31
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,512
Erin, listen to me- this doesn't make sense.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,514
You wouldn't risk exposing yourself

33
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:39,016
here in the United States for a train bombing.

34
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,351
It's not big enough.

35
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,770
We'll take that into consideration when we interrogate him.

36
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,730
I am not messing with you.

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,608
You're going to tell me. What is happening at 8:00!

38
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,278
Jack!

39
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,739
What is your primary objective?!

40
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,866
Secretary of Defense!

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,785
Heller.

42
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,705
Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you?

43
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,666
Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason:

44
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,252
because you are my son!

45
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,379
Audrey, it's Jack.

46
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,089
- Are you still at Richard's?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,757
You need to get your father out of there now.

48
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,300
Your father is the real target.

49
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,802
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,516
Jack!

51
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,518
Audrey?

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,480
Audrey?!

53
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,694
The following takes place between 8:00 A.M. AND 9:00 A.M.

54
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,512
Richard Heller?

55
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,768
They took my father and my sister.

56
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,806
I don't care. It's been over five minutes.

57
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,349
You need to widen your perimeter.

58
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,977
You're not listening to me. I'm not interested in local law enforcement.

59
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,896
I want Secret Service swarming that area now.

60
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,856
Good. Get back to me.

61
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:51,565
Everyone...

62
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,651
everyone, please listen up.

63
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,948
Secretary of Defense Heller was abducted a few minutes ago,

64
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,993
along with his senior policy analyst Audrey Raines.

65
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,414
Heller was at his son Richard's house when he was taken.

66
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,999
LAPD is bringing Richard in for questioning.

67
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,335
This is a top-priority situation.

68
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:15,589
I want all inter-agency protocols activated immediately.

69
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:18,551
Move off that page.

70
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,095
You have to link up to the Secret Service Channel.

71
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,055
It's not that simple. We're locked out for a few minutes.

72
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:23,931
Why?

73
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,516
They're sequestering the rest of the Cabinet.

74
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,101
Driscoll's not going to want to hear that.

75
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,394
She wants us to activate these protocols.

76
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,478
What do you want me to do?

77
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,564
I want you to break through those channels. Hack in if you have to.

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,986
Chloe, I need you to move everything from the train bombing

79
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:37,653
to the secondary server.

80
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,696
- I did that already.
- Good.

81
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,699
Then re-key the databases so the kidnapping and bombing are synched up as well.

82
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,616
- I did that, too.
- What haven't you done?

83
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,620
I haven't opened a pipe to the Army Criminal Investigation Division yet.

84
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,997
- Do it.
- I'm on my way to.

85
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,750
Yeah, I'm looking at it. They've widened the perimeter.

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,002
Do you have an I.D. on any possible transportation?

87
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,503
I'm working on it. The only problem we have...

88
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,963
I'm going to have to get back to you.

89
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,506
Erin, I need to speak to you.

90
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,507
You're done here, Jack.

91
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,717
- Just listen to me.
- I'm detaining you...

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,177
Erin, just listen to me!

93
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,928
Secretary Heller is my responsibility.

94
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,515
Now, I need you to reinstate me on a provisional basis until I get him back.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,142
You don't give me orders, Jack.

96
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:13,272
I'm detaining you until an investigator from Division can take your statement.

97
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,858
I'm going to recommend that you be arrested for torturing a suspect

98
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,277
and rendering him useless for questioning.

99
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,695
You weren't getting anywhere with him.

100
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,156
Because of me, Sherek told you everything he knows.

101
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,699
You'd better hope so.

102
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,953
Would you please escort Mr. Bauer to a vacant office until Division gets here?

103
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:29,747
I'm fine.

104
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,916
You're making a mistake.

105
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,044
- Excuse me.
- What?

106
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,253
- President Keeler.
- What about him?

107
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,506
- He wants to talk to you.
- All right.

108
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,806
- This is Erin Driscoll.
- Please hold for the President.

109
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,477
What can you tell me about the attack on the Secretary?

110
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,521
We know that he was taken along with his daughter,

111
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,189
approximately ten minutes ago.

112
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,316
But you haven't had any contact yet from the kidnappers?

113
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,402
No, sir, we have not.

114
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,279
How is it the Secret Service wasn't able to protect him?

115
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:06,325
It's my understanding that he broke his schedule to visit his son.

116
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,120
Somehow the kidnappers had access to that information.

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,705
We're loing into that now.

118
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,499
All right.

119
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,086
We're gonna go to an elevated level of security.

120
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,130
I want you to take the appropriate measures.

121
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:19,714
I understand.

122
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,215
Get them back, Erin.

123
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,842
We're doing everything we can, sir.

124
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,305
Hello.

125
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,515
- Mom?
- Hi, sweetie.

126
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,517
- I didn't expect to hear...
- Mom, listen to me.

127
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,185
You got to get out of the house right now.

128
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,228
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,689
Someone's looking for me, and they might come for you next.

130
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,025
What kind of trouble are you in?

131
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,484
I don't know.

132
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,030
I found something on the Internet. Now these people are after me.

133
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,282
Andrew, you are being paranoid.

134
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,618
Mom, they killed Melanie. They killed everybody in the office.

135
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,246
- What?!
- They shot 'em.

136
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,583
- Mom, I'm really scared.
- My God.

137
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,294
I'm going to call the police.

138
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,462
Just get out of there!

139
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,757
Get to one of your friends' houses and stay there! Go! Go now!

140
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,508
Andrew?!

141
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,455
I told them Driscoll wanted me to question you.

142
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:37,208
What's going on, Chloe? What are you doing?

143
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,080
I'll probably get in trouble for coming to you with this, but I don't care.

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,544
I may have a way to find Heller.

145
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,500
I'm being detained. Why are you telling me?

146
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,710
Because I don't think Driscoll's handling this the right way,

147
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,635
and I don't trust her. I trust you.

148
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:51,722
Sit down.

149
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,188
A good friend of mine called about 40 minutes ago.

150
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,981
This is someone I went to school with.

151
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,567
I know him. He wouldn't have come to me unless it was something serious.

152
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,568
What is it?

153
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,655
He noticed somdangerous computer code was planted on the Internet this morning.

154
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,156
How is that connected to Heller?

155
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,491
Because it originated in Turkey

156
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,118
just like everything else that happened today.

157
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,411
Sherek, the train bombing.

158
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,495
Where's your friend now?

159
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,380
LAPD has cordoned off the area,

160
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,592
and you can see them taking Secretary Heller's son away from the scene now.

161
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,222
That's being done for his own protection, according to a police sources.

162
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,932
Those same sources tell us

163
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:38,769
that at least five Secret Service agents were shot and killed

164
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,229
in the kidnapping.

165
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,400
There is also a belief tonight that the Secretary's daughter...

166
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,152
- Hello?
- Andrew, it's me.

167
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,404
What did you do, Chloe? Who did you tell?

168
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:49,989
What do you mean?

169
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,240
Everyone's dead!

170
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,867
They're dead!

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,493
Now they're trying to kill me!

172
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,537
Andrew, talk to me. Who's dead? What happened?

173
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,248
Everyone's dead! They're dead.

174
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,501
After I called you, I went back to my office.

175
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,837
There was a guy there torturing Melanie.

176
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,757
He wanted to know who hacked into their system.

177
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,551
And then he shot her!

178
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,970
God...

179
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,180
Who shot her?

180
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:15,723
Who's this?

181
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,309
My name is Jack Bauer. I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.

182
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,894
Andrew, we need your help.

183
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:20,686
What?!

184
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,856
Secretary Heller was kidnapped less than half an hour ago.

185
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,275
I believe the same people that kidnapped him

186
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,401
are the ones that are chasing you now.

187
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:28,986
But I don't know anything!

188
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,697
Son, you've been targeted for a reason.

189
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,115
You know more than you think.

190
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,286
What... What do I do?

191
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:38,788
Where are you?

192
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,499
I'm at Union Station. I'm getting out of town.

193
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,084
No, you stay put.

194
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,503
The best thing you can do right now is let me bring you in.

195
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,215
Chloe, what should I do?

196
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,633
You can trust Jack.

197
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,513
Okay.

198
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,515
I'll be next to track three,

199
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,891
at the bottom of the ramp.

200
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,102
Andrew, what are you wearing?

201
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:07,692
Uh, bluejeans, brown, brown jacket and a, and a black bag.

202
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,195
Okay, you stay put. I'll be there in about

203
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:12,488
30 minutes.

204
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:13,531
Okay.

205
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:17,159
This is all my fault.

206
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,495
I shouldn't have let Driscoll talk me into handing it over to the FBI.

207
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,623
She did what?

208
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,917
She told me to give it to the FBI.

209
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,442
Yes.

210
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,485
I found the person who stumbled onto our server.

211
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,570
Is he with you now?

212
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,488
No. I'll have him shortly.

213
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,198
Find out who he's talked to.

214
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,491
Of course.

215
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,286
And then kill him.

216
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:00,703
Yes.

217
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,881
- Is everything in there?
- Yes.

218
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,591
Where's Behrooz?

219
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,886
Upstairs, checking traffic on-line.

220
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,512
It's almost time for him to go.

221
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:23,934
Are you sure you don't want me to take the briefcase to Omar?

222
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,811
The plan is in place.

223
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,146
I don't want to deviate.

224
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,483
Why?

225
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,070
This is the key to everything we're doing today.

226
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,530
It's a lot to entrust to a teenager.

227
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:37,698
I told you...

228
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,951
our whereabouts have to be accounted for today.

229
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:44,163
Besides, it's because he's a teenager that he won't arouse suspicion.

230
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:47,792
You're right.

231
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,590
Don't worry, Dina.

232
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,676
We've prepared well for today.

233
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,639
The train, the kidnapping, it's all gone as expected.

234
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,558
I spoke with Omar.

235
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:05,810
He's happy.

236
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,941
And he knows Behrooz is the one who will deliver the device?

237
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,151
Yes, he knows.

238
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,243
Behrooz will be fine.

239
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,253
Okay, people, we're looking to find a connection

240
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,839
between the train bombing in Santa Clarita and Heller's abduction.

241
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,007
Sarah?

242
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,676
NTSB has given us a full passenger list.

243
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,678
We're processing those names now.

244
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:41,846
What about Heller's son?

245
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,557
Is it possible he had something to do with this?

246
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:46,517
We're not counting anything out at this point.

247
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,102
He's being brought in here for questioning now.

248
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,648
Erin, I need to speak with you privately, please?

249
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:55,443
- You're testing me, Jack?
- Erin, please.

250
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,407
Curtis will hand out assignment protocols to each department.

251
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,117
I want status reports every 15 minutes.

252
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,215
I have information that you ignored that appears to be connected

253
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,092
not only to the bombing but the kidnapping of Secretary Heller.

254
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:21,344
What information?

255
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,512
A computer programmer by the name of Andrew Paige

256
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,515
accidentally came across a possible Internet strike earlier this morning.

257
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,392
I know. It was passed on to the FBI.

258
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,144
Yes, against CTU protocol.

259
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,979
You abandoned an active investigation

260
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,898
by a CTU agent during a terrorist strike.

261
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,983
I just got confirmation from the LAPD

262
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:40,029
that Andrew Paige's co-workers were all found dead less than 20 minutes ago.

263
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,282
I'll coordinate with FBI

264
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,909
and we'll take over the investigation of that lead.

265
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,160
No, you won't.

266
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:49,163
I just talked to the kid. I'm the only one who knows where he is.

267
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,582
You want that kid picked up, you're gonna have to reinstate me.

268
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,878
I'm having you locked up for impeding my investigation.

269
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,922
You do that and I'll tell the president

270
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,675
that you had Sherek in custody over a half an hour

271
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,510
before Secretary Heller was even kidnapped,

272
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,220
and that you couldn't break him.

273
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,054
I did.

274
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,767
You threatening me, Jack?

275
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,522
I am asking you to let me help rescue Secretary Heller.

276
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,625
This is how it's gonna work.

277
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:39,672
I'll reinstate your commission on a temporary basis until Heller is safe.

278
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,758
You will not make any unilateral decisions.

279
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:46,387
You will work as an auxiliary agent under the authority of Ronnie Lobell

280
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,016
and then I'll hand you over to Division.

281
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,341
What are they going to do to us?

282
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:07,051
I don't know, but if they wanted me dead,

283
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:09,137
they would have killed me at Richard's house.

284
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,431
Richard. My God.

285
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,225
He was still in the house. I don't think they went in there.

286
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:18,396
Listen to me, Audie, no matter what happens to me,

287
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,441
they have no reason to hurt you.

288
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,110
They don't need a reason.

289
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,196
And I don't want you to give 'em one.

290
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,198
Do what they say.

291
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:31,201
Whatever happens to me, don't provoke them.

292
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:34,704
If they threaten me, if they hurt me...

293
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,539
even if they kill me-

294
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,626
do what they say.

295
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:52,180
I only asked for Heller.

296
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,682
I didn't want to kill her without your permission.

297
00:16:58,186 --> 00:16:59,646
- Daddy! No! Dad!
- Leave her alone!

298
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:01,898
Don't you touch her!

299
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,067
So help me, God I will kill you myself.

300
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,235
Dad! No!

301
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,653
Son of a bitch!

302
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,654
Come on!

303
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:08,988
Yes or no?

304
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,406
Do not do this!

305
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,491
Leave her alone!

306
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,585
Not yet.

307
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:28,007
We may be able to use her.

308
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,719
Take them away.

309
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,555
Dad. Dad.

310
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:50,071
I'm going with Ronnie over to the train station to pick up Andrew now.

311
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:51,656
Has Driscoll cleared you for fieldwork?

312
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,283
- Yeah.
- That's unlike her.

313
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,951
I hope you didn't tell her I gave you the information.

314
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,369
I'm not in the mood for a confrontation.

315
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:57,287
I didn't.

316
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:59,455
Have we heard anything from any of the Secret Service agents

317
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,748
that survived the kidnapping?

318
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:02,458
There's only one so far- he's in surgery.

319
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:03,793
Any other witnesses?

320
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,920
The son Richard. They're bringing him in now.

321
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:10,091
Okay. Get back to me as soon as you've got anything on Secretary Heller or Audrey.

322
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:13,845
Sure. Bad luck about Audrey being there when her dad got kidnapped.

323
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,014
Yeah.

324
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,353
I'm going to my car to get my things.

325
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:25,982
Okay, so let me understand this.

326
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:28,276
Bauer illegally shoots a suspect

327
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:30,236
and now you're going to let him back in the field.

328
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:33,156
He'll only give us the location if I let him work it.

329
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:36,618
He can't hold back information, Erin. It's not his privilege.

330
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,953
We don't have time to interrogate him.

331
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,915
It's a simple job, Ronnie.

332
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,917
You pick up the subject and you bring him in.

333
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,461
Bauer has not been in the field for a year and a half, okay?

334
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,421
That has consequences. It's my ass that's...

335
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:51,049
Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash.

336
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,092
It's not optional- it's an order.

337
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,845
Fine.

338
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,321
I'm ready to go.

339
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,200
This is a simple task, Behrooz,

340
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,036
but these are the ones where mistakes can be made.

341
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:21,663
Drive carefully.

342
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:25,041
If there is anyone in the area who looks suspicious,

343
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,835
drive away and call us.

344
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,336
Understood?

345
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,505
Yes.

346
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,221
Hello.

347
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,515
Mrs. Araz, this is Debbie.

348
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,892
Yes, Debbie, what can I do for you?

349
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,937
Can I please talk to Behrooz?

350
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,690
Let me see if he's here. Hold on.

351
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,444
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

352
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:56,114
Debbie?

353
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:58,157
I've left like ten messages on your cell phone.

354
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,534
Why haven't you called me back?

355
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,910
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

356
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:02,495
Doing what?

357
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:05,665
Working for my father.

358
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,043
I don't believe you.

359
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,921
Look, Behrooz, if you're seeing someone else,

360
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:12,881
at least have the decency to tell me.

361
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:14,716
I'm not seeing anyone else.

362
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,009
Then why are you avoiding me?

363
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,302
I'm not.

364
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,638
Look, Debbie, this isn't the right time to do this.

365
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,433
See? That's what I'm talking about. Now, you're still avoing me.

366
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:24,893
I'm not.

367
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,020
Then why can't we talk now?

368
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:30,148
Because I can't.

369
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,400
I've gotta go.

370
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:33,443
Behrooz!

371
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:38,156
Behrooz.

372
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,119
That's not the right way to deal with this situation.

373
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:45,413
This girl needs to know it's over

374
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,041
and that there will be no more phone calls.

375
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,251
I'll take care of it later, Mom.

376
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,087
I don't want to be late getting this to Omar.

377
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,934
You sent Jack Bauer out in the field?

378
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:07,602
He'll be with Ronnie.

379
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:08,728
Yeah, but why?

380
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:10,271
He knows our procedures,

381
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,857
and he may have information about Heller that'll be useful.

382
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:13,858
What is it, Chloe?

383
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,110
Curtis, you wanted me to tell you when Richard Heller had arrived.

384
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,612
He's on his way to Holding.

385
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,281
All right, thanks.

386
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,617
Do you want me to choreograph the jurisdictions?

387
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:24,744
No, I'll do it. Find out what the son knows.

388
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,454
Chloe, I'd like to talk to you.

389
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,794
Has it occurred to you that we might be farther along

390
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:35,547
if you trusted me half as much as you trust Jack Bauer?

391
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,298
You know what, Ms. Driscoll?

392
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:38,508
I'm really not in the mood to play the part

393
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,760
of the scared student in the principal's office.

394
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:43,763
I came to you with important information that my friend Andrew gave to me,

395
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,140
and you chose to not respond to it.

396
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:49,394
When you came to me with the original information,

397
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:51,604
we were looking for Sherek, were we not?

398
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,189
Yes.

399
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:55,483
He was our most important lead at the time, wasn't he?

400
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:56,568
I guess.

401
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:58,570
Then my question to you is,

402
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:01,030
once we had Sherek in custody,

403
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:04,826
if you felt that your Internet lead was still valuable,

404
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:07,078
why didn't you reprise it?

405
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:12,333
You're right. I felt more comfortable going to Jack.

406
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:15,670
Well, at least that's honest.

407
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:21,843
You can go back to work now.

408
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,023
Check that, please.

409
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:38,401
For the record, Jack,

410
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:41,070
I think Driscoll made a mistake by letting you come along.

411
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,030
All right.

412
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,032
And just so we're clear, I give the orders.

413
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:45,950
I'm fine with that.

414
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,203
Look, what happened earlier in Holding with Sherek

415
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:51,080
I had intel that told me I didn't have time to do it any other way. I'm sorry.

416
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:53,833
Apology accepted, but if you try to exceed my authority again,

417
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,293
I will stop you cold.

418
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:16,856
Okay, fine.

419
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,900
Then talk to Marcy, have her isolate all the death threats

420
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,485
Heller's received over the last six months.

421
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,570
I want phone calls, e-mails, snail mails,

422
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:24,739
everything sent over to CTU for analysis.

423
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:27,951
Well, for the time being, I'm working with them.

424
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:28,952
Yeah.

425
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,912
Okay, good. Thanks.

426
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,916
Has Heller been getting a lot of death threats lately?

427
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,502
No more than anyone else in the Cabinet.

428
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:43,716
So, what's it like working in DC?

429
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:47,303
For the most part, we solve problems in theory that'll never come into play.

430
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:48,555
You wouldn't be interested.

431
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,014
Then why do it?

432
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,141
I've got my reasons.

433
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,354
Hey, man, I'm just trying to make some conversation.

434
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:01,818
I read your file.

435
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:04,779
Must've really burned you up when Driscoll fired you.

436
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,614
She did me a favor.

437
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:08,032
I wanted to get my life back.

438
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,451
I wouldn't have been able to do that if I was still doing fieldwork.

439
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:13,788
So, how's the master plan going? Do you have a life yet?

440
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,044
Yeah.

441
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:25,383
Yeah, I got a life.

442
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,604
We'll be fine, Audie.

443
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,939
We're still on U.S. soil.

444
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:43,401
That's not going to help us if this is some sort of suicide mission.

445
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,824
You said Jack tried to warn you about this, before they grabbed us.

446
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,785
Yeah, that's right.

447
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:55,121
That means he must have a reliable source,

448
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:57,248
which means our chances are good.

449
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:10,094
Audie, sit down.

450
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:15,975
I am your father.

451
00:25:16,184 --> 00:25:17,393
Do you trust me?

452
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,813
- Of course I do.
- Then listen.

453
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,776
You cannot allow a negative thought to enter your head now.

454
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,322
They will find us. We will be rescued.

455
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,449
- Say it.
- Please, Dad...

456
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,911
We will be rescued. Say it, Audie.

457
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,624
We will be rescued.

458
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,584
We will be rescued.

459
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:02,355
Take off your clothes.

460
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:04,524
You first.

461
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:07,277
Take off your clothes.

462
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:21,165
Go to hell.

463
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,134
Stop! Please stop it! Dad...

464
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,020
- Who is it?
- It's Behrooz.

465
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,669
Behrooz?

466
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:02,851
Good job, Behrooz.

467
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:35,091
Debbie, what are you doing here?

468
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:36,885
- I followed you.
- Why?

469
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,511
Because I didn't believe you.

470
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,430
I thought you were seeing someone else.

471
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:43,349
Look around. Does it look like I'm seeing anybody else?

472
00:28:45,268 --> 00:28:47,937
Debbie, you shouldn't be here. I'm here doing business for my father.

473
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:50,398
He doesn't like me socializing when I'm working for him.

474
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,150
Okay.

475
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:54,194
I get it.

476
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:57,405
That doesn't explain why you stopped calling me.

477
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:01,075
It's my parents.

478
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,246
They've got a problem with me seeing someone who's...

479
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,416
Not Muslim?

480
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:11,586
Yeah.

481
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,380
And that's it?

482
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:16,257
- Whatever they say, you do.
- No.

483
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:18,343
Then what's going on between us, Behrooz?

484
00:29:18,468 --> 00:29:19,719
Do you want to be with me or not?

485
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,846
- I do, but...
- But what?

486
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:25,642
Debbie, I want to straighten things out, okay?

487
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:27,810
But I can't do it now.

488
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:29,812
We'll get together later.

489
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:34,442
Debbie, please...

490
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:05,308
Is everything ready in Richard Heller's holding cell?

491
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:06,267
Just about.

492
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:08,186
They brought in the equipment and they're starting to hook him up.

493
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,437
Then let's do it.

494
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,231
Does Driscoll know you're subjectin

495
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:14,317
the Secretary of Defense's son to a lie detector?

496
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:15,318
Yes.

497
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:17,779
- Is he a suspect?
- Not exactly.

498
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,489
But he's on very poor terms with his father.

499
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:21,115
I wouldn't want to rule anything out.

500
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:23,701
You want to be in the room on this?

501
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:25,703
No. I'll observe through the one-way.

502
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:26,704
Okay.

503
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:34,295
What are you doing to me?

504
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:36,130
What are you doing?!

505
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:38,091
We just want to make sure you're telling us the truth.

506
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,884
Why would I lie to you?!

507
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,761
My father and sister have just been kidnapped...!

508
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:44,430
Please sit back, Richard,

509
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:46,349
or I'll have to sedate you.

510
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,059
You can't do this to me.

511
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,104
My father is the Secretary of Defense.

512
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:52,188
I understand.

513
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:53,606
But according to my information,

514
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,358
you were about to unleash personal attacks

515
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,735
on your father and the President at a rally at Lockheed today.

516
00:30:57,944 --> 00:30:59,487
Are you insane?

517
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:02,740
This is America. I can say what I want in public.

518
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:04,659
How dare you treat me like a criminal.

519
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,369
No one's treating you like a criminal.

520
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,662
You want to do something constructive?

521
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,455
Why don't you go find my father and my sister.

522
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:10,998
We intend to.

523
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,793
Yeah, by treating me like I'm guilty or something!

524
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:15,003
Richard...

525
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:18,297
right now you're the only witness to your father and your sister's kidnapping.

526
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:20,383
We need your help.

527
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,093
Then why don't you get these things off of me

528
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:25,054
and start talking to me like a normal human being.

529
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:27,598
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

530
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,560
No.

531
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:32,061
How's the polygraph?

532
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:33,896
100 percent.

533
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:47,702
Father.

534
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:56,294
How did everything go?

535
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:58,796
It went fine.

536
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:13,353
Omar said one of his men saw you with someone outside the compound-

537
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:16,105
a young woman.

538
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:18,483
I was going to tell you.

539
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:21,069
Who was it?

540
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,032
Debbie.

541
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,368
Where is she now?

542
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:29,619
She didn't see anything.

543
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,829
She saw you outside at the compound. That's enough.

544
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:33,414
No...

545
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:39,921
We've spent years planning for this, waiting for this day to come.

546
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:43,132
Now it's here and you've compromised everything.

547
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,802
She didn't see anything, I made sure of it.

548
00:32:47,303 --> 00:32:49,472
We'll see how much she knows.

549
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:52,767
Call her and tell her to come here.

550
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,395
Father, please don't do this, it's not necessary.

551
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:57,689
I decide what's necessary, not you.

552
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:02,985
What are you going to do to her?

553
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,071
Since when do you question me?

554
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:10,910
How long have we lived in this country preparing for this day?

555
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,163
How long?!

556
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:15,748
Four years.

557
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,167
Almost five.

558
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:24,716
That's how much time can be erased by a simple mistake.

559
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:36,185
Call her. Now!

560
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,313
Yes, sir.

561
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:50,199
Tim Felson, MTA.

562
00:33:50,324 --> 00:33:52,285
Ronnie Lobell, CTU. Head of field ops.

563
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:53,870
Where's track three?

564
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:56,456
East entrance. If you want, I can have my guys lock it down.

565
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:59,000
No, no. Don't want to draw attention to anything yet.

566
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,127
The platform's just at the end of this hallway.

567
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:18,186
- Hello.
- Andrew, it's me.

568
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:20,063
Where are these guys?

569
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:21,773
They're outside. They should be there any minute.

570
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:23,900
All right. Tell them to hurry up.

571
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,068
It doesn't work that way.

572
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,612
Just stay where you are and I'll talk to you when they bring you in.

573
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:28,780
Okay.

574
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:30,198
Andrew?

575
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,533
Yeah. Are you Jack Bauer?

576
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:34,285
Yes. Come on, let's go.

577
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:35,620
Where are we going?

578
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,663
I'll explain later. It's not safe here.

579
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:39,165
Let's go.

580
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:48,007
Just around the corner.

581
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,602
You sure he said the bottom of the ramp?

582
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,020
Yeah.

583
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:17,954
- Hello.
- Andrew.

584
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:21,165
- Who's this?
- It's Jack Bauer. Where are you?

585
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:25,003
Andrew?

586
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,755
I can't really, uh... talk.

587
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:32,093
Let's go.

588
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:34,595
Andrew? Andrew?!

589
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:36,931
Son of a bitch, they got to him before we did.

590
00:35:37,098 --> 00:35:38,683
How did they know where he was going to be?

591
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:39,976
I don't know!

592
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:42,812
Who are you?

593
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:46,149
I'm the man that's going to kill you if you don't follow my instructions.

594
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,316
Felson, come on.

595
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,568
Alert your MTA's.

596
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,486
Tell them we've got a Caucasian male, early 20s,

597
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,697
wearing a brown jacket and carrying a black bag

598
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:54,365
being taken from this station against his will.

599
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:55,950
Tell your men not to engage the target.

600
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:57,744
I want a visual and a location- that's it.

601
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:58,953
Now.

602
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:14,969
Where are you taking me?

603
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:24,312
This is Marx, I have the target sighted.

604
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:25,313
What's your twenty?

605
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:26,939
I'm on the train platform.

606
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,192
Target is on the East periphery.

607
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,152
Second level parking lot.

608
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:32,904
Open the door.

609
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:36,115
They're getting in a dark blue Lexus.

610
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:37,158
What's the fastest way?

611
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,159
Straight out the back.

612
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,243
Tell your man to stay out of sight.

613
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,829
Marx, stay on the guy, but make sure he doesn't see you.

614
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:47,418
Lay down.

615
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,008
There he is.

616
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,260
You get the gate, I'll get the kid out of the car.

617
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,554
Wait.

618
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:40,722
Wait for what?

619
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,057
This isn't the right play.

620
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:44,600
What are you talking about?

621
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,686
If we follow this guy, maybe he'll lead us to Heller.

622
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,230
Or maybe he won't, but you know he'll kill the kid, Jack.

623
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,400
Right now, this hostile's our best chance to find Secretary Heller.

624
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,738
We'll break him back at CTU.

625
00:37:57,196 --> 00:37:58,948
You don't know if you can break him in time.

626
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,992
This is not a field ops call, Jack.

627
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:04,912
- We need authorization.
- No.

628
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:09,083
I can't take the chance of Driscoll resisting me.

629
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,598
I told you not to go against me, Jack.

630
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,641
Ronnie, please...

631
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,144
You get up, enterlace your hands behind your head.

632
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,313
- You're making a mistake.
- Shut up.

633
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:44,744
Gate four. He's leaving the parking lot. What do you want me to do?

634
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:51,042
This is Agent Lobell. I'm moving in now.

635
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,461
Let the front car go ahead and lock in the hostile.

636
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:21,531
Ronnie.

637
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,367
Ronnie, where you been hit?

638
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,412
Can you move?

639
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:30,540
Ronnie...

640
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,209
Give me the keys to the cuffs.

641
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:41,217
Please, Ronnie.

642
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,760
He's our only lead.

643
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:44,804
We gotta stop him.

644
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,356
Come on!

645
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,250
Damn it.

646
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:46,240
Tell me what happened, Richard.

647
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:51,412
My father and I were talking, and...

648
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,917
my sister came in with a phone call for him.

649
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:57,669
So he was in the room on the call?

650
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,463
No. He and Audrey went outside.

651
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,340
Go on.

652
00:41:02,382 --> 00:41:04,175
And then I heard an explosion,

653
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,469
and I looked out the window and I see them both being grabbed.

654
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,262
And they didn't come in and get you?

655
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:12,392
Excuse me. I know you told me not to interrupt, but we need you on the floor.

656
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:13,559
What's going on?

657
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,187
A webcast signal is being pushed onto servers all over the place.

658
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,689
A webcast of what?

659
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,399
Secretary of Defense Heller.

660
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,361
The terrorists are broadcasting this all over the Internet.

661
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:25,238
Call Curtis.

662
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:28,282
Curtis, we need you on the floor.

663
00:41:56,686 --> 00:41:58,730
There you are, you son of a bitch.

664
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,235
We speak for the men, women and children who've had no voice until now,

665
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:08,239
who've been victimized by the genocidal policies of the United States

666
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:10,158
that James Heller has advanced.

667
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:14,203
But the time has come for the victims to demand justice.

668
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,789
Edgar, isolate Secretary Heller.

669
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:21,336
Our soldiers have taken the terrorist James Heller into custody.

670
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:26,507
In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity.

671
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,634
If he is proven guilty,

672
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,596
he will be executed in accordance with our laws.

673
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:34,932
Because we have nothing to hide,

674
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,936
the world will have full access to these proceedings.

675
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,936
