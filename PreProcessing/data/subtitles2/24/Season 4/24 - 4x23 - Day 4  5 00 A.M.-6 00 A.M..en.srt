Previously On 24

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,543
I'm just been told a cruise missle,has just

7
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:17,968
been launched containing
the nuclear warhead?

8
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:18,839
Yes,sir,that's correct.

9
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:20,364
What about Marwan,Jack?

10
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:21,356
You think that he will break?

11
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:22,688
That won't be easy,sir.

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,132
He's planned and organized
everything that's happened today,

13
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:28,237
Now how am I supposed to be able to fight

14
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,440
terrorists while I'm
provoking a nuclear superpower?

15
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:33,874
We marched onto Chinese soil, we
kidnapped one of their nationals

16
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,345
and in the process the
Chinese consul was killed.

17
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:40,633
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese
soil could be construed as an act of war.

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,561
I assume you know
this man- Howard Bern.

19
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,009
One of your field agents.

20
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:48,947
A security camera at the Chinese
consulate picked up your face.

21
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:49,858
That's impossible.

22
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:50,768
I was wearing my mask.

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,095
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame.

24
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:52,704
It was you.

25
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:53,448
I'm sorry, Jack.

26
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:54,446
You got to go.

27
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,670
There's a chopper waiting for you.

28
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:57,740
It doesn't matter where you take me.

29
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:00,228
What I want is already happening.

30
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,262
Go!

31
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,707
Notify the perimeter we no
longer have Marwan in custody!

32
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,899
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.

33
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,735
This is a sketch of the guy
that Richard Heller described.

34
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:19,442
He and the girl are our
only leads to finding Marwan,

35
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,268
One of us is going to get
caught to save the other?

36
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,340
It's gonna be you.

37
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:25,293
Tony, wait.

38
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:28,408
I can't spend another day without you.

39
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:29,190
I'm ready...

40
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:30,293
to leave here.

41
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:31,436
I'm ready to go with you.

42
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:33,934
Be careful.

43
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:35,877
Tony, this is Jack.

44
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,194
Has anybody reported any outside movement?

45
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:38,862
No, why?

46
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:40,147
The man is dead.

47
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:42,005
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

48
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:43,450
Tony, do you copy?

49
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,467
Tony, do you copy?!

50
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,772
Castle, why is Almeida not on comm?

51
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,375
All teams, this is Bauer.

52
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,246
Castle is down.

53
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,047
Almeida is missing.

54
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,696
I repeat, Almeida is missing
and possibly a hostage.

55
00:01:54,697 --> 00:02:01,517
The following takes place
between 5:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,900
Jack xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

57
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,400
No, we do not have the
female hostile in custody.

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,900
She's hiding somewhere here
in the apartment complex.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,300
She killed agent Castle, and I believe
she's taken Tony Almeida as a hostage.

60
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Is there any way she slipped the perimeter?

61
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,365
No.

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
The perimeter's airtight, but there's
over 600 apartments in the complex.

63
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:18,600
We have to search them room by room.

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,500
Listen, we need more personnel here.

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,400
Jack, we're running low on manpower.

66
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Damn it, Bill, there's a missile in
the air carrying a nuclear warhead.

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,300
This is our best shot of taking
it out before it hits its target.

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
The White House has us running point
with DOD to find to find the missile.

69
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:32,000
We're stretched thin.

70
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Jack, we'll have LAPD send more men,

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,100
and we'll send Curtis and
another tac team to the location.

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, fine.

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,122
We've already initiated a search
starting with the buildings

74
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,200
nearest the perimeter working our
way in, but we need LAPD here now.

75
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,100
Keep us posted.

76
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,900
Contact division, see if
they can spare more men.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
I'll call the Liaison at LAPD.

78
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,640
We've almost completed
our second satellite pass

79
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,500
over the current flight
radius of the missile.

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
And no sign of it yet?

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
No, not so far.

82
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,340
What do you think our
realistic chances are of being

83
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,400
able to locate the missile
with subsequent passes?

84
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't think they're very good.

85
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,665
This missile's an s-class.

86
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
It uses elements of stealth technology.

87
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,300
It was designed to evade detection.

88
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm aware of that, but it will
still have a heat signature.

89
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,300
Yes, but the lower the missile flies to
the ground, the harder it is to pick up.

90
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,700
How much longer until you've
completed the second satellite pass?

91
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,000
Uh, less than 20 minutes.

92
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,700
All right, get back to me as
soon as you have the results.

93
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,400
All right.

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,365
I don't care.

95
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
We need every available agent there now.

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,365
But they are not clear for field work.

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Well, bump up their security level
on a provisional basis if you have to.

98
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:33,300
Call me back with the exact
number when you have it.

99
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,900
All right, coordinate that
with Edgar Stiles here at comm.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,700
Thanks, Rick.

101
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,800
What did LAPD say?

102
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,965
They're keeping certain units in reserve...

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,100
but they're sending more
patrolmen to help Jack, right?

104
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,636
They're sending nine over
there now, and they're

105
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:45,999
going to try to pull
another 12 from east valley.

106
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:46,500
Nine?

107
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,900
That's not nearly enough.

108
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,900
We'll have to reassign our
people, send them over there now.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm taking care of that, Michelle.

110
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:52,400
When?

111
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,800
We need people there now.

112
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,200
This woman has to be captured.

113
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,900
Michelle.

114
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,100
Everyone understands what's at stake here.

115
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,700
We're going to do our
best to find this woman,

116
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,600
but we have to remain calm, or
everything will spiral out of control.

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
You're right- I'm
not being objective.

118
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
I'll admit it.

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,111
I'm worried about what
this woman might do to Tony,

120
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:19,500
but I will not lose
sight of the big picture.

121
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,400
The big picture is that we have
to apprehend this hostile alive.

122
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Nothing else matters.

123
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
What is it, Marwan?

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
You're late.

125
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,100
You were supposed to check in.

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,800
I know.

127
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
There was a hitch.

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,400
Nothing serious.

129
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,800
Um, I am going to be there.

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,900
What kind of hitch?

131
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,100
There was a problem in the
apartment, and I'm dealing with it.

132
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm leaving in one hour.

133
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
I'm not waiting for you.

134
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,500
I know, and I'm going to be there.

135
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,800
Well, we don't have much time.

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
They're very close to finding us, and that
would be very, very bad for both of us.

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,100
So, tell me, Tony, two years ago,

138
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,600
you put Michelle Dessler's
life ahead of national security.

139
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:51,600
You let a suspect escape,
and you committed treason.

140
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,700
Is she going to do the same for you?

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,300
Mike, it's Audrey Raines.

142
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,900
Yes, Audrey, what have you got?

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Well, the second satellite pass is complete.

144
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
We were unable to detect the
missile with thermal imaging.

145
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
There's just too much radiant
heat from ground sources.

146
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,100
Ms. Raines, this is President Palmer.

147
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,900
Is there a chance another satellite
pass will find the missile?

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Well, the more data we have,
Mr. President, the better,

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,200
but a more intensive pass
will take two to three hours.

150
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
And we expect the missile to
find its target before then.

151
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Yes, sir, we do.

152
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,800
All right.

153
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,300
Make sure FBI's on a real time link
with all local emergency channels.

154
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,700
All right. I'll get that done right now.

155
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,525
I also want you to
compile disaster scenarios

156
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,200
for the urban centers
within range of the missiles.

157
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,400
Sir, that's 20 of the largest
cities in this country.

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm aware of that.

159
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,722
I want death rates,
fallout patterns, emergency

160
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:54,800
response predictions
laid out for all of them.

161
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,800
Yes, sir, I'll take care of that right now.

162
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,100
Thank you, Ms. Raines.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
As additional teams arrive on site,
assign them sections of the grid.

164
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,865
We do not want people
bumping into each other.

165
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
If the subject is spotted,
what's the approach protocol?

166
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,650
We maximize for capture.

167
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,000
There can be no lag time.

168
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,400
Don't you want to evaluate the
formation since she's got Tony hostage?

169
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
We proceed as if there is no hostage.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,200
There is only one operational objective,
and that is to capture this woman.

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,700
Make sure that's the profile
you send out to all the teams.

172
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,200
Understand?

173
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,100
Yes.

174
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,000
Dessler.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why don't you get somewhere
private where we can talk?

176
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Who is this?

177
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm sending you the answer.

178
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Tony!

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Now do you know who this is?

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
And don't bother trying
to triangulate the call.

181
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,400
It's scrambled.

182
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,800
Please...

183
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,765
don't hurt him.

184
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,100
He's okay for now, but he won't be unless
you do everything that I say, Michelle.

185
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,200
I understand.

186
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,700
I need your help getting out of here.

187
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,700
Wh-what kind of help?

188
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You're hesitating.

189
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,465
I'm not, I'm not.

190
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I just need to know what you want me to do.

191
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,500
Your men are between me and my exit.

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,700
I need to know what their search
patterns are and how many men there are.

193
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Okay, okay, I'll find out.

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
You'll tell me right now.

195
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,094
I have to go downstairs and
talk to my tactical team.

196
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,400
Oh, Michelle, you're stalling.

197
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,600
How many men are there total?

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Upwards of 30, not including LAPD,
and reinforcements are on the way.

199
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,800
You will need you to remove your men
from the northeast driveway of the complex

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I-I-I don't know
if I can do that.

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,600
You will redeploy your men by the
time I call you back, or Tony dies.

202
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,600
When are you calling back?

203
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,700
Soon.

204
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,200
Get moving, Michelle.

205
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,700
Well, she still loves you.

206
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
The question is how much.

207
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,500
Edgar Stiles.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Edgar, send the deployment
group to my screen.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,465
It's updating.

210
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,000
Want the last version,
or do you want to wait?

211
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,000
Just send it!

212
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
Are LAPD reinforcements there yet?

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,900
They're outside now.

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Some will be there in 15 minutes.

215
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
You want me to send the
updated grid when it comes in?

216
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,000
Ms. Dessler?

217
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes.

218
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,500
Yes, do that.

219
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,412
No, no, we can't eliminate the midwest, or

220
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:26,000
any region within the
missile's flying range.

221
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,900
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

222
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:31,200
This warhead could hit anywhere.

223
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,100
We're still putting together
the projected casualty numbers.

224
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,200
We just know they're gonna be high.

225
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

226
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Where are we on the search
of the apartment complex?

227
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,100
Nothing so far.

228
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,400
LAPD there yet?

229
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,900
They're on their way.

230
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,500
I'll be at comm.

231
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,500
I can't do this.

232
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,100
You can't do what?

233
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,900
I can'T...

234
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,300
sacrifice the lives of all those
people if this warhead goes off.

235
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
She called me.

236
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Who?

237
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,400
Who called you?

238
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
The hostile who has Tony.

239
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,000
When?

240
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,100
What did she say?

241
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
A couple minutes ago.

242
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,700
She said to redeploy our
men so she can get away.

243
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,600
Or Tony dies.

244
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,700
Yes, sir.

245
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,300
Patch me through to Jack Bauer's comm.

246
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,800
Right away.

247
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,400
Take your team.

248
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,300
Start working the second floor, building 11.

249
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,400
Jack, you read me?

250
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,400
Yeah, I copy.

251
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,500
We've got something.

252
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
The suspect contacted Michelle.

253
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,400
She confirmed she's holding Tony hostage.

254
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
She's trying to use him as leverage
against Michelle to open up an escape route.

255
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,000
Is Michelle there?

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm right here, Jack.

257
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,900
Do we have any idea where she is?

258
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,500
She wants me to clear a path
in the northeast driveway.

259
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,400
She's going to call to
confirm that I did it.

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,000
When?

261
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,900
I don't know.

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Could be any second.

263
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,800
Michelle, I want you to make her believe
that you're still cooperating with her.

264
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,400
I need you to draw her into the open.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,700
I promise you that we will
do everything we can for Tony.

266
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,800
Okay.

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,100
Stay ready for her call.

268
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Bill, I'm gonna pull all our units
out of the northeast driveway,

269
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,565
put them in concealed
positions outside the complex.

270
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
It's still possible
she'll change her mind at

271
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:26,200
the last minute and try
another escape route.

272
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
I know, and we'll be ready
for that, but if she doesn't,

273
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,300
I want her to believe that
Michelle's still complying.

274
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,800
As soon as she's 50 yards
outside of the complex and

275
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,100
can't reenter- that's when
our teams will converge.

276
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
Let me know when your
men are ready to redeploy.

277
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Copy that.

278
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,800
You all right?

279
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:45,800
Yeah.

280
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
I was gonna do what she wanted.

281
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,800
Michelle...

282
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,000
I didn't call you right away.

283
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,200
All I could think of, at
first, was saving Tony's life.

284
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,200
It's okay.

285
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,800
It's done.

286
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,800
All designated teams, prepare to move into
your secondary positions on my command.

287
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,500
Curtis?

288
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,600
What do you need me to do?

289
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
Some of the residents aren't
cooperating with the search.

290
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,223
I want you to have LAPD units start

291
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:34,000
arresting anybody that's
giving us a problem.

292
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,800
You got it.

293
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,900
Why don't we pull some of
the resources off the search?

294
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,595
We have a better chance
of finding the hostile

295
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:39,900
through her communication with Michelle.

296
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:40,165
No.

297
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,700
The hostile's gonna be looking for
any sign that Michelle's betrayed her.

298
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
We have to follow procedure as if we
have no idea they've been in contact.

299
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,300
Understood.

300
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,700
As soon as you're done with
LAPD, I need you with me.

301
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,100
You got it.

302
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,900
Bill, this is Jack.

303
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:52,500
Do you copy?

304
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,200
Yeah, Jack.

305
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
We're ready to go down here.

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,700
Any new communication with the hostile?

307
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:56,865
No.

308
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Michelle's still waiting for her call.

309
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
Have you been able to make
any kind of id on scene?

310
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,783
Forensics tried to pull prints from her last

311
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:04,400
known position, but they
came up with nothing.

312
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,600
Same result here.

313
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,300
No match on the voiceprint.

314
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,500
She's managed to stay
completely under the radar.

315
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,500
We're gonna have to hope that
because how fast this is moving,

316
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,400
she slips up and makes a mistake.

317
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,700
Otherwise, we're in trouble.

318
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Proceed when ready, Jack.

319
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:17,000
We're standing by.

320
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,000
Copy that.

321
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,600
All northeast driveway teams,
move in to secondary positions.

322
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:22,100
We're a go.

323
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,065
Hi.

324
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,036
What are you doing?

325
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:07,500
Hey.

326
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,965
You were supposed to stay in your apartment.

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
Don't you know there's some crazy
person loose in the building?

328
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:12,700
Yeah, I know, I know.

329
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:13,300
Hey, man.

330
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Where's Joz?

331
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,200
He just got up.

332
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,600
Can you just get him, 'cause
I just need to talk to him?

333
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:19,500
Something happened.

334
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,500
Joz.

335
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,200
What's going on

336
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,800
Nothing.

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
Just weird stuff.

338
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,100
What?

339
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,065
Nothing.

340
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,800
Why don't you just tell me?

341
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,900
No, it's cool.

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
Hey, what's going on, Rothenberg?

343
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,100
Hey, man.

344
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,700
How are you?

345
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,700
Not a sound.

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,400
I just got off a very disturbing phone
call from the Chinese foreign secretary.

347
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,900
So they're still pressing us
on the attack on the consulate?

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
It's much worse than that, David.

349
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,400
The fallout from that attack
you authorized is escalating.

350
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,500
They're determined to pin this on us.

351
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,865
If they manage to confirm
that this is one of our men,

352
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,500
I don't have to tell you what
kind of a disaster that would be.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,100
No, sir, you don'T.

354
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,476
But this alone is not
conclusive enough for the

355
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:30,100
Chinese to turn this into
an international incident.

356
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:31,465
But if they find corroborating evidence?

357
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,350
CTU is doing whatever they can
to prevent that from happening,

358
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,200
including getting this agent
out of sight until it blows over.

359
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,541
I know I gave you the
authority to make the decision,

360
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,800
but you never should
have ordered that assault.

361
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,800
If we hadn't carried out the raid, sir,
we'd be nowhere on stopping the missile.

362
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
And where are we, David?

363
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Is there some progress I don't know about?

364
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
CTU is closing in on one
of Marwan's associates.

365
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,158
If they apprehend her in time, they feel
that they can use her to find Marwan.

366
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,200
Do you know how speculative that sounds?

367
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,700
My god, we're never gonna find it in time.

368
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't say that!

369
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,700
We will stop it.

370
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,100
But you must believe that
if you're gonna lead today.

371
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,065
How am I gonna believe that?

372
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,005
Every second that passes brings that missile

373
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:20,300
closer to its target, which
for all we know, is us.

374
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,700
We are not sitting on
our hands, Mr. President.

375
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,800
We are using every resource at
our disposal to find this missile.

376
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,600
We will prevent the warhead from going off.

377
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,000
I wish I was as confident as you are.

378
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,800
You need to be.

379
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,200
Remain Presidential.

380
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,100
Demand nothing less than success
from your people, and you will get it.

381
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,600
All right.

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,600
All right.

383
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
What do I tell the Chinese foreign
secretary when I talk to him next?

384
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:00,200
You don'T.

385
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
Let Mike handle this.

386
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,800
You'll tell them, unless they
have proof of our involvement,

387
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,500
you don't want to hear from them today.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,100
Mr. Buchanan, Agent Bern on six.

389
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Send it to my cell phone.

390
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:19,900
Yes, sir.

391
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,200
Buchanan.

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,665
It's Agent Bern, sir.

393
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,100
I got a message to call you as
soon as I landed in San Diego.

394
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Are we on a secure line?

395
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
Yes, sir, it's an encrypted cell.

396
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,159
The Chinese are continuing
to press the case that

397
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,300
we were involved in the
assault on their consulate.

398
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,500
Have they managed to find evidence
beyond the surveillance video of me?

399
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,000
No.

400
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,500
And we have to make sure they don'T.

401
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,500
I want you to start fabricating
an alibi with CTU in san diego.

402
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
I want you to make it to look like you
were working there during the assault.

403
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,100
Our transport's arriving right now, sir.

404
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,500
I'll get right on it.

405
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,300
The alibi has to withstand careful scrutiny.

406
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,100
The San Diego phone logs, rosters, and
mainframe records all have to back it up.

407
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,400
It'll be airtight, sir.

408
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,100
It has to be.

409
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,900
Sir, about my family.

410
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,900
Do you think there's any chance that
the Chinese will try to get to them?

411
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,900
They can'T.

412
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,987
We've already contacted
your wife, and we've moved

413
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,800
her and your kids to a
hotel for the time being.

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
I'll be in touch, agent.

415
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,400
Thank you very much, sir.

416
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Drive!

417
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,500
What the hell is this?

418
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
I think you already know what "this" is.

419
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,600
CTU sent a team into our
consulate just a few hours ago.

420
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,800
You were on the team, and our
consulate general was killed.

421
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,600
You're going to tell me who was responsible.

422
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

423
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,000
Really?

424
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,800
Then why were you being transported
here by helicopter from CTU Los Angeles?

425
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
You don't know where I came from.

426
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,900
Actually, I do.

427
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,400
Before entering CTU earlier tonight, we
turned our satellite on that location.

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
While I was questioning your superiors,

429
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,800
our satellite picked up someone
being taken away by helicopter.

430
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,700
So what?

431
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,100
That wasn't me.

432
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,100
No, it was you!

433
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,928
The Chinese government insists that someone

434
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,100
take responsibility for
the death of our consul.

435
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,500
What does that mean...

436
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,000
"take responsibility"?

437
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,300
Now, I believe you were
only following orders.

438
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,300
Tell us who gave the
orders, and I'll let you go.

439
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm not telling you anything.

440
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,500
I believe you're going to change your mind.

441
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,165
Yes?

442
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Have you redeployed all your men?

443
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,900
Yes, I have.

444
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,665
Bill?

445
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,200
It's Jack.

446
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,200
Uplink is on.

447
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,300
Are you sure they
followed your instructions?

448
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm sure.

449
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,400
It's starting to rain pretty hard, Jack.

450
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,000
Michelle...

451
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,600
do you love Tony?

452
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Yes, I love him.

453
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,500
Good.

454
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,465
Because if I find out that
you're trying to play me,

455
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,900
the very first thing I'm going
to do is blow his brains out,

456
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:41,300
and don't think that there's
anything you can do to stop it,

457
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,100
'cause there's not, understand?

458
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,500
Okay, I understand.

459
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,300
Good.

460
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,300
Stay by the phone.

461
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
All comm analysts, clone this call
and filter it through all our servers.

462
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,700
Do you have a multiple source on audio?

463
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,300
- No. Just one Telco feed- low res.
- No, I know the configuration, Edgar.

464
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,200
I need to know if we can multiplex,
pull some background noise off.

465
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,800
We need to pinpoint the source.

466
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I was going to do that.

467
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,265
When?

468
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,500
This is happening now!

469
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,879
- I shouldn't have to walk
you through this, damn it!

470
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,107
You don't have to walk me through this.

471
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm setting it up now.

472
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,800
Go to delta two, Edgar.

473
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:11,600
It's all there.

474
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,700
I will not let this thing fall apart
because of technical incompetence.

475
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,300
All right, I've got confirmation.

476
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,534
All our visible forces have been pulled

477
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,900
away from this street
all the way to western.

478
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,700
Okay, good.

479
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,900
Jack.

480
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,900
We've got something.

481
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,800
Building three, west entrance.

482
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,200
Edgar, video feed.

483
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,100
Yes?

484
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,900
Okay, Michelle, we're on our way.

485
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Okay, it's them.

486
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,300
I've got a gun on Tony.

487
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,765
My finger's on the trigger.

488
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,900
If I move it, he's going to die.

489
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
I told you, I moved my men.

490
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,600
She's completely in the open.

491
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,400
She's running a huge risk
exposing herself like that.

492
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,500
So far, so good.

493
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
She's crossing the street.

494
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,300
When she gets into the car,
she can't stay on top of him.

495
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:27,400
That's our opportunity.

496
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
She's moving towards the black jag.

497
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,500
All teams, hold your position

498
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,200
Okay, here's the deal.

499
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,600
As soon as we're in the car
and we've cleared the area,

500
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,100
I'm going to call you, and I'm going
to tell you where you can find Tony.

501
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,900
Okay.

502
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
All right, move, move.

503
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:50,400
Bill, not yet.

504
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,700
All teams stand down!

505
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,800
I see your men, Michelle.

506
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,065
You lied to me, you bitch.

507
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,800
You are not going to take me alive, got it?

508
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,500
No!

509
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
No!

510
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,700
Bill, they're gone.

511
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,100
She blew herself up in the
car, and she took Tony with her.

512
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:28,700
They're gone.

513
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,000
I understand Bill Buchanan
requested a conference call.

514
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,565
Yes, sir.

515
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
We were waiting for you to begin.

516
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,700
Bill, we're all here; go ahead.

517
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm afraid that
Marwan's associate-

518
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,900
the woman we hoped would
help us locate the missile-

519
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
has killed herself and one of our agents.

520
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,700
Oh, my god.

521
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,500
Bill, did she leave behind any
physical evidence that could help us?

522
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,800
It doesn't appear so.

523
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,900
So, what is CTU going to
do now to find the missile?

524
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Mr. President, at this point,

525
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,404
CTU no longer has any
reasonable expectation of

526
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:27,700
finding the missile before
it reaches its target.

527
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,600
This is it; it's going to happen.

528
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,700
What do we do?

529
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,500
At this point, we have no choice but
to alert all state and federal agencies,

530
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,300
and focus all our resources
on managing the aftermath.

531
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
But we don't even know the missile's target.

532
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
We can assume it will be a major city.

533
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,100
But no matter what the target is,

534
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,300
there will be widespread
panic across this country.

535
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,900
We need to mobilize the army and
the national guard in every state,

536
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,000
and draw up a declaration of martial law.

537
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,800
Yes, we need to do that.

538
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,300
Bill, all federal agencies need to prepare
for the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

539
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:16,000
CTU's priority should
be disaster management.

540
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,900
Redeploy your people now.

541
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,900
Understood.

542
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,865
Edgar Stiles.

543
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,500
Edgar, tell Jack the
field operation is over.

544
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,500
Have him bring his people
back here immediately.

545
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Got it.

546
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,000
The worst disaster in this country's
history is taking place on my watch!

547
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

548
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,500
You failed me, David.

549
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,000
And you failed your country.

550
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
I can't even imagine
what you must be feeling.

551
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,500
I know...

552
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,000
part of you is second-guessing
your decision...

553
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,200
but you couldn't place Tony's life before
the lives of potentially millions of people.

554
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,800
You made exactly the decision
Tony would have wanted you to make.

555
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,900
That's our job.

556
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
That's why we signed on.

557
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,400
We decided we were going to leave this.

558
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,700
Go somewhere and start again.

559
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,200
Michelle...

560
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,365
I want to get back to work.

561
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
We still have to find this missile.

562
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,100
No, I want you to go home.

563
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
I'll be okay, Bill.

564
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,700
That's not advice.

565
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,900
That's an order.

566
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,700
Buchanan.

567
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,900
Sir, Jack says he's not
pulling his men out yet.

568
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,900
Did you tell him we have
orders from the White House?

569
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,700
Yeah, but he says he's not ready.

570
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,700
Put him on the video phone
in the situation room.

571
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,800
You lied to me, you bitch.

572
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,200
You are not going to take me alive, got it?

573
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,665
Play it again.

574
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,500
Give me more damn volume on the phone call.

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,488
Jack, we need to redeploy.

576
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:00,300
Just do it!

577
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,000
Jack.

578
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,800
Tony's gone.

579
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm sorry, Curtis.

580
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,800
Just play it again, please.

581
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,300
Okay.

582
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
Jack, you've got a phone call.

583
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,800
This is Bauer.

584
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,700
Jack, why haven't you redeployed?

585
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,565
The operation's over.

586
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,565
The hostile killed herself.

587
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,965
Because it doesn't make any sense, Bill.

588
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,043
Everything that we know
about this woman tells

589
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,000
us that she's a professional, not a fanatic.

590
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,000
We had her cornered.

591
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,800
Her next move was to try and negotiate
for her freedom, not kill herself.

592
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,600
In theory, I agree with
you, but you saw what I saw.

593
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,700
All I saw were two darkened figures
in the rain concealed by an umbrella,

594
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:46,200
and an explosion, and I saw
that from half a block away.

595
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,400
Jack, you've got to focus now.

596
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,300
Nobody here is holding you
responsible for Tony's death.

597
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,200
You got to let this go.

598
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,100
Bill, you're not listening to me.

599
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Jack, we reviewed the tactical feed.

600
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,100
There is nothing to
suggest we were deceived.

601
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,800
Look, I know Tony was your friend,

602
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,384
and you probably feel responsible
for getting him involved today.

603
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:07,100
This is not about Tony!

604
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,500
This is about her,

605
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,865
and until I can absolutely
confirm that she is dead,

606
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,600
I am maintaining this perimeter, and
I am going to continue this search.

607
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,800
Jack, I'm working under
orders from the White House.

608
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,800
You have ten minutes, then
I want you to move out.

609
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,000
Can you enhance the image from here?

610
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,900
Not in the field.

611
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,900
Then play it again

612
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Okay, here's the deal.

613
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,900
I still can't hear the audio properly.

614
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,000
Give me a headset.

615
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm going to call you, and I'm going
to tell you where you can find Tony.

616
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,300
I see your men, Michelle.

617
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:49,600
You lied to me, you bitch.

618
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,200
You are not going to take me alive, got it?

619
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,000
Play back the last 15 seconds.

620
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,900
What are you seeing, Jack?

621
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,200
It's not what I'm seeing.

622
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Come on, play it back.

623
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
I see your men, Michelle.

624
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,400
You lied to me, you bitch.

625
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,700
It was pouring rain.

626
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,600
You can see it bouncing off the car.

627
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
You can't hear it on her
side of the phone call.

628
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,700
She was making that call
from somewhere else...

629
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:16,200
indoors.

630
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,800
She'd want a position that would give
her a clear line of sight to the car.

631
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,600
That would put her in the building
that the couple exited from.

632
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Get the teams ready; we're moving in now.

633
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,000
Alert all teams.

634
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,500
We'll converge on building 11.

635
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,900
Well, they're heading back in.

636
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,100
Looks like my neighbors died for nothing.

637
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
They know you're still in here.

638
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
Open up the palm of your hand.

639
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,300
Here are the keys.

640
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,800
Take off your cuffs.

641
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Put these on.

642
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,500
We're getting out of here.

643
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,100
Okay, now cuff yourself back up.

644
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,900
Let's go.

645
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
We got every way in and
out of the building covered,

646
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,800
and we got men on every
floor going room by room.

647
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,000
We need to take her alive.

648
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,200
Everyone's aware.

649
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,200
Agent Bauer.

650
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah?

651
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
We found fresh blood outside an apartment.

652
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Where?

653
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,600
208.

654
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,000
Stand down until we get there.

655
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:26,500
Copy that.

656
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,800
Curtis take the door.

657
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,900
Curtis, she went this way.

658
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,900
Turn around.

659
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,100
Move.

660
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,200
Don't move!

661
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Drop the gun!

662
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,100
It's over!

663
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,100
Take one more step, and I'll kill him.

664
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,200
Do it, Jack.

665
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Do what you have to do.

666
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,800
Shut up.

667
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,521
Do you really have what it takes to let me

668
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,000
kill him while you're
looking him in the eye?

669
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Yes.

670
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,500
I believe you.

671
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,400
So what's to stop me from shooting him?

672
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,200
You can'T...

673
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,100
kill me, can you?

674
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,600
You need me.

675
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,700
Tony.

676
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,100
Hostile is down.

677
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
I repeat, the hostile is down.

678
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,365
Get a medic down here.

679
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,100
I want her conscious as soon as possible.

680
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,000
Look at me.

681
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,300
You okay?

682
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,500
You okay?

683
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,100
Yeah.

684
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,900
Get me that medic now!

685
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,700
He's on his way.

686
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,700
Does Michelle know I'm alive?

687
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,300
No, not yet.

688
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,000
I'll call CTU on my cell so
you can talk to her privately.

689
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,800
Thanks.

690
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,500
Buchanan.

691
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,500
Bill, this is Jack.

692
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,365
Jack, what's going on?

693
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,600
Have you redeployed back to CTU?

694
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:06,965
No.

695
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,300
We just apprehended the hostile.

696
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,500
What?

697
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,300
She's unconscious, but she's unharmed.

698
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:12,300
Tony's okay, too.

699
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,700
Thank god.

700
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,600
I'll alert the White House.

701
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:16,200
Okay, good.

702
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Bill, Tony wants to talk to Michelle.

703
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:19,100
Can you put her on the line?

704
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,350
She's not here.

705
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,100
I sent her home.

706
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:21,765
I'll, uh...

707
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,400
I'll find her and patch
her through to your cell.

708
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,200
Thanks.

709
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,200
Hello?

710
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Michelle, it's Bill.

711
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,600
Tony's alive.

712
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,100
What?

713
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,700
He wasn't in the car.

714
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,300
He's okay.

715
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,800
I'll let Tony explain it to you.

716
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Hold on for him.

717
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,100
Michelle, it's me.

718
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,700
Tony?

719
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,200
Oh, my god...

720
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,600
it's okay, honey.

721
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:18,500
Oh, my god...

722
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,500
what happened?

723
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,900
She made somebody else wear my clothes.

724
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,900
She needed to keep me
alive until she got out.

725
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,200
Jack figured it out.

726
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,900
He was able to save me.

727
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,700
I don't know what to say.

728
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,900
Look, you don't have to
say anything, sweetheart.

729
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,650
I'm coming to CTU right now.

730
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:38,800
I'll see you in a few minutes.

731
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,500
Michelle...

732
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,800
I love you.

733
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
I love you, Tony.

734
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
Get President Palmer patch through.

735
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
We're going to have to structure a deal.

736
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,800
Yeah, all right.

737
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,900
She's conscious.

738
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,800
Pick her up!

739
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,400
Call the White House now.

740
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,800
Where is Marwan?

741
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
That's what I thought.

742
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,000
We're both professionals.

743
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,800
You know that I can force this information
out of you, but I'm running out of time.

744
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,465
We never get second chances in our line
of work, but I'm going to give you one.

745
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,146
I have the power to give you a
deal signed by the President of the

746
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:29,900
united states that grants you
immunity from past and present crimes.

747
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,744
In exchange, you're going
to help me find Marwan

748
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,800
and stop this warhead
from hitting its target.

749
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:35,600
Do you understand?

750
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,700
Do you understand?

751
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,900
You are either going to help
me now, or I will kill you.

752
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,400
Show me the deal.

753
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,900
You were part of the covert team that
mounted the assault on our consulate-

754
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,000
an operation that resulted
in the death of our consul.

755
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Who led the mission?

756
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,900
Who is responsible for what happened?

757
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:23,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

758
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,100
Please, Mr. Bern, you're wasting time.

759
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,200
Give us a statement, and we'll release you.

760
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,765
I'm telling you the truth,

761
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,100
and you're going to have to release me as
soon as CTU realizes what's happened to me.

762
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,000
Actually, Mr. Bern...

763
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,300
no one will ever know, and
we will never tell them.

764
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,100
What are you talking about?

765
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,100
The China queen container ship is
moored at the port of San Diego.

766
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,400
If you don't give us our
statement, we'll put you on board,

767
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:57,600
and you will arrive in 18
days in the port of Hangzhou.

768
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,300
Then we will transport you 2,800
miles to the province of Xinjiang,

769
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,287
where you will be remanded to the maximum

770
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:08,900
security labor camp on
the border with siberia.

771
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,700
You wouldn't do that.

772
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,600
Why wouldn't we, Mr. Bern?

773
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,200
We want justice.

774
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,911
If you're not going to tell us
who was ultimately responsible

775
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,400
for the situation at the
consulate, that leaves you.

776
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,300
Your wife and your two
daughters will not be notified.

777
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,800
The U.S. Government will not be notified.

778
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,800
Therefore, there will be no
chance for prisoner exchange.

779
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,700
There will be positively
no chance of escape...

780
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,500
for the rest of your life.

781
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Decide, Mr. Bern.

782
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,600
The China queen is on a tight schedule.

783
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,600
I don't know.

784
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,200
All we want
is a name-

785
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,128
a recorded statement naming the person

786
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:19,000
responsible for what
happened at the consulate.

787
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,700
Then...

788
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,900
then what happens?

789
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,600
You will walk right out of that door.

790
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,800
No, I meant...

791
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,500
to him.

792
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,000
As I said...

793
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
all we want is justice.

794
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,100
His name...

795
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,500
is Jack Bauer.
