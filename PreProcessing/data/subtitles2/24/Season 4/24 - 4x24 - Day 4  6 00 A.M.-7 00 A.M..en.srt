1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,730
The Chinese are continuing to press the case

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,790
that we were involved in the assault on their consulate.

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,850
Have they managed to find evidence

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,320
beyond the surveillance video of me?

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,490
No... and we have to make sure they don't.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,740
You were part of the covert team

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,140
that mounted the assault on our consulate.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,040
If you're not going to tell us who was ultimately responsible,

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,740
that leaves you.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,630
If it's Stealth,we can't track it by radar.

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,927
Those missiles travel at a speed of 600 miles an hour,

12
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,783
which means it could hit a target on either coast in under three hours.

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,700
That's assuming it's headed for the coast.

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,060
If it's not,it could hit its target at any time.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,430
What is CTU going to do now to find the missile?

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,920
At this point,CTU no longer has any reasonable expectation

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,400
of finding the missile before it reaches its target.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,640
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,090
You failed me,David.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,640
And you failed your country.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,390
Drop the gun!

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,330
It's over. -TONY: Do it,Jack.

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,910
Do you really have what it takes to let me kill him

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,310
while you're looking him in the eye? -Yes.

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,340
JACK: Tony...

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,450
I have the power to give you a deal

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,370
signed by the President of the United States.

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,450
In exchange,you're going to help me find Marwan

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,950
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Show me the deal.

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,320
Bill,this is Jack.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,970
Has the President signed the pardon yet?

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,370
Any minute now.

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,550
I don't like that we're cutting this woman a deal,Jack.

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,120
We can't verify she's telling the truth until it's too late.

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,950
We don't have a choice.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,840
Right now,she's the only person that can lead us to Marwan,

38
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,550
and Marwan's controlling the missile.

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,760
Has the Attorney General reviewed this immunity agreement?

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,120
Yes,sir.

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,390
We should be getting his final approval any minute now.

42
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,240
PIERCE: Mr. President,I'm sorry to interrupt,

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,180
but there's something you might want to see.

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,940
It may affect the immunity agreement.

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,620
What is it,Aaron?

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,600
The woman you're about to pardon...

47
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,490
I'm pretty certain you've met her before.

48
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,040
Explain.

49
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,130
May I?

50
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,010
Absolutely.

51
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,030
On the right

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,160
is the hostile we have in custody.

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,400
On the left,

54
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,240
this is news footage from four-and-a-half years ago in Los Angeles

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,840
moments before the attempt on your life.

56
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,220
You're telling me the woman

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,080
we're about to cut a deal with

58
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,130
tried to assassinate me?

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,900
Yes,sir.

60
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,520
Novick.

61
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,730
All right. Thank you.

62
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,930
Mr. President,the Attorney General says

63
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,820
the immunity agreement is in order,

64
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,140
ready to be signed.

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,730
LOGAN: If I read this document right,

66
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,510
it grants immunity not only for what this woman has done today,

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,470
but for any crimes she's ever committed in the past.

68
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,400
NOVICK: That is correct,sir.

69
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,010
Sign it.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,730
We're trying to get you the deal,

71
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,950
but we will pull it if the missile hits first.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,190
I will talk when my representatives confirm my immunity.

73
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,010
Not before.

74
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,140
Manning.

75
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,280
Yeah.

76
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,840
She's right here.

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,060
I'm listening...

78
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,330
Is the paperwork in order?

79
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,090
Good.

80
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,390
Where is Marwan?

81
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,090
The Global Center.

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,190
A helicopter is waiting for him on the roof

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,310
that will be taking him to a ship.

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,120
If he flies low enough,he'll evade radar.

85
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,350
When is he leaving?

86
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,640
Now.

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Get the chopper ready.

88
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,090
Alpha Four,it's Manning.

89
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,550
She stays here until we verify this.

90
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,280
Simmons,this is Bernhardt. What's your 20?

91
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,690
Capturing Marwan alive

92
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,320
is our only chance of stopping this warhead

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,660
from hitting its target.

94
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,090
We are not to use lethal force even in self-defense.

95
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,920
Am I clear?

96
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,910
Got it,Jack

97
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,910
Let's go!

98
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,860
She's not answering her phone.

99
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,720
She should have been here already.

100
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,950
She said she was delayed.

101
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,830
We're not waiting.

102
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,100
How long before we get to the ship and international waters?

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,330
Ten minutes.

104
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,960
Something's wrong.

105
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,060
Edgar,it's Jack.

106
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,150
We're almost there.

107
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,170
Have you got confirmation on the target?

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,400
We just repositioned the satellite.

109
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,200
The images are coming through now.

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,020
There,on top of the Global Center

111
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,130
I see a chopper.

112
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,060
Southeast corner.

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,590
Copy that.

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,660
I want you to take a southeast approach.

115
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,900
Stay below the building.

116
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,320
Missile still on target.

117
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,720
We've got to get out of here.

118
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,560
Just a few minutes until we're up to speed.

119
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,870
<i>Okay,come up over the building now!</i>

120
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't let him take off!

121
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,270
Stay above him!

122
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,390
Go! Go!

123
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,760
I can't! He's right on top of me.

124
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,280
Go!

125
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,330
PILOT: The engine's out!

126
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,560
Put me in a position to bail.

127
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,450
JACK: There he is!

128
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,990
I got you covered.

129
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,550
Clear!

130
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
No!

131
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,790
Tell me where the missile is.

132
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,410
Tell me where it is.

133
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,070
Tell me where it is.

134
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,920
No!

135
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,260
No!

136
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,130
I don't understand. Bauer had orders to take Marwan alive.

137
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm sure Jack did whatever he could.

138
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,910
That's not good enough,David.

139
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,060
CTU is searching Marwan's helicopter,

140
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,830
trying to find something that will help them locate the missile.

141
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,770
We're out of time.

142
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,910
Not yet.

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,280
Mr. President...

144
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,257
I'm sorry to add to an already difficult situation,

145
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:50,823
but the acting Chinese consul,Su Ming,is on teleconference.

146
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,250
He says it's urgent.

147
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,370
Put him through.

148
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,290
Gentlemen...

149
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,250
as we discussed earlier,

150
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,730
our consulate in Los Angeles

151
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,050
was attacked three hours ago.

152
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,490
A Chinese citizen was abducted,

153
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,090
and our consul killed.

154
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,450
We've already given you our assurance

155
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,450
that we had no knowledge of this reprehensible attack.

156
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,820
Which is strange,

157
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,350
since one of your agents has confessed his direct involvement

158
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,950
and implicated his superior,as well.

159
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,580
What are you talking about?

160
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,870
My name is Howard Bern.

161
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,410
I'm a federal agent with the Counter-Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles,

162
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,490
speaking of my own free will,under no duress.

163
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,130
I participated in an unlawful assault

164
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,750
on the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

165
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,670
I was acting under the orders of Special Advisor

166
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,650
to the Secretary of Defense...

167
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,910
Jack Bauer.

168
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,860
SU: Mr. Bern provided details which leave no doubt

169
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,770
that he is telling the truth.

170
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,680
The full tape will be forwarded to you immediately.

171
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,010
Putting aside the question of

172
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,520
how this so-called confession was obtained,

173
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,820
what does your government expect us to do?

174
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,100
Mr. Bauer committed a crime at our consulate,

175
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,570
which is Chinese territory.

176
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,360
If he was acting without your approval,

177
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,460
he should be turned over to our government

178
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,440
to be tried and sentenced according to our laws.

179
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,570
Mr. Su,we'll get back to you.

180
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,260
Damn it,David,you said this would be handled.

181
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,370
I'm sure the Chinese don't want war.

182
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,880
<i>No. But they do want to embarrass us,</i>

183
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,400
take the moral high ground

184
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,470
in the court of world opinion.

185
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,230
Well,we need to take the least-damaging course of action.

186
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,750
Unfortunately,then,there's only one option.

187
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,770
Which is?

188
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,630
We hand Bauer over to the Chinese.

189
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,060
Unacceptable.

190
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,740
Besides,if we turn him over,

191
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,070
he'll implicate this administration.

192
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,030
The Chinese made Bern talk.

193
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,400
They'll do the same with Bauer,eventually.

194
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,440
<i>Jack Bauer would never compromise national security.</i>

195
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,310
As much as I'd like to believe that,everyone breaks.

196
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,970
What you believe is irrelevant.

197
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,360
<i>There is another option,Mr. President.</i>

198
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,820
Go on.

199
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,160
Suppose something happens to Bauer?

200
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,720
Suppose he has an accident?

201
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,110
That's an obscene suggestion.

202
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,860
It solves a lot of problems.

203
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,900
PALMER: Mr. President!

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,180
This administration does not condone murder.

205
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,830
And it never will.

206
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,360
Is that clear?

207
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,020
Yes,sir.

208
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,720
I'm sorry,sir.

209
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,480
Did you find anything on Marwan's body?

210
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,190
We're still looking. Are you okay?

211
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,590
I'll be a lot better once we take this missile down.

212
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,310
MacALLAN: Sir,we might have found something in here.

213
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,780
What is it? It's been shot up pretty badly,

214
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,090
but one of the drive platforms is intact.

215
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,230
It's some kind of tracking or navigation program with a GPS node.

216
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,420
Adams is uplinking whatever's left to CTU.

217
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,060
Okay,thanks.

218
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,240
Buchanan.

219
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,830
Bill,it's Jack. Forensics found something.

220
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,290
They sent it over... Chloe's got it.

221
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,350
She and Edgar are trying to download the interface.

222
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,140
How close are they?

223
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,930
I'll put you on speaker.

224
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,590
You're on,Jack.

225
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,270
Chloe,have you got anything on that program?

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,930
Nothing yet.

227
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,710
Give us a second,Jack.

228
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,320
It's totally random. I can't make any sense of it.

229
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,800
Maybe try a correlation matrix.

230
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,500
What's that going to do?

231
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,490
Just do it,Edgar.

232
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,900
I told you it wasn't going to work.

233
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,960
That's because you didn't expand the parameter.

234
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,900
See?

235
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,900
What have you got?

236
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,670
Two parallel columns,

237
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,820
but the data points are badly damaged.

238
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,910
What do you mean,parallel columns?

239
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,650
They could be a flight path.

240
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,750
I'll try plotting them over the USGS map.

241
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,580
It's working.

242
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,920
If that's a flight path,it's headed due west,over Nevada.

243
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,860
It's Los Angeles.

244
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,030
It's gotta be. It's coming towards Los Angeles.

245
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,690
Chloe,run a time analysis.

246
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,370
Assuming the missile travels at 600 miles per hour,

247
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,600
it puts it within this 30-mile segment.

248
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,950
I'll get those coordinates to the Air Force.

249
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,790
Captain Clarke,Bill Buchanan,CTU.

250
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,600
The missile's heading for Los Angeles.

251
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,980
We've narrowed the possible coordinates.

252
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,390
We're uploading them to you now.

253
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,390
Okay,thanks.

254
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,660
They have planes ready in the air now.

255
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,870
If our projections are correct,

256
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,280
they should be able to find it quickly.

257
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,710
They'd better,since the casualty figures of an L.A. air strike

258
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,210
would be over a million lives lost,

259
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,400
including ours.

260
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,660
Put the military channel on speaker.

261
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,940
Delta One,I'm approaching the designated segment.

262
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,270
Roger that,Delta One.

263
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,810
Still no joy target. Searching.

264
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,950
Jack,if the missile gets shot down,

265
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,150
could the warhead detonate?

266
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,800
No,the warhead is specifically designed

267
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,520
<i>not to blow up until it hits its designated target.</i>

268
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,220
But the force of the impact could trigger the arming mechanism,right?

269
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,260
It's unlikely.

270
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,090
But it is possible,right,Jack?

271
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,950
Yes,it's possible,but we don't have a choice;

272
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,430
we're out of time here.

273
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,600
This is Air Control.

274
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,990
I've got a blip at 40.38 south by 30.16 west. Respond.

275
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,220
Closing in on those coordinates.

276
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,130
Possible contact. Breaking left.

277
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,760
Delta One,I've got tally on the target,12:00.

278
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,690
I'm arming.

279
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,150
I'm in range,sir. Request clearance to engage.

280
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,400
Delta 2,target is confirmed.

281
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,230
I've got good tone. Fox two. Missile away.

282
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,240
Splash one.

283
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,900
That's a direct hit,Delta One. The target is down.

284
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,310
I repeat,the target is down.

285
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,030
Here's the report so far.

286
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,780
No nuclear radiation

287
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,700
was emitted when the missile was destroyed.

288
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,150
Debris hit the ground and,uh...

289
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,760
there was some damage and several injuries,

290
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,660
but no loss of life as far as we know.

291
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,290
We'll pick this up later.

292
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,900
When they told me you were dead...

293
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,170
It's all right.

294
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,290
Oh,I love you.

295
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,950
I didn't realize how much until I thought I lost you.

296
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,000
What is it?

297
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,160
When that woman called and she told me...

298
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,440
Hey,listen... you did what you had to do.

299
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,950
<i>But I didn't do what you did.</i>

300
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,550
You chose me,and I chose...

301
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,920
Look,we did the best we could,all right?

302
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,510
Now it's over.

303
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,530
No,commercial flights are still grounded. I'm...

304
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm trying to get Paul back on a military transport.

305
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,080
Yeah,I haven't taken care of his funeral arrangements yet.

306
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,520
I still need to call his mother.

307
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,980
Listen,I-I'm gonna,I'm gonna have to get back to you.

308
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,060
There's something I need to deal with.

309
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,050
Your father said you're going to Washington tomorrow.

310
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,390
Yeah,I have to take care of Paul's funeral.

311
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,110
And after that?

312
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,450
I'm sorry,I...

313
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,740
I know this isn't the right time

314
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,990
to talk about everything.

315
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,170
Maybe tomorrow before you catch your flight,

316
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,630
we could,we could get together.

317
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,710
Jack,I don't think that's a good idea.

318
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,670
I thought we agreed that we...

319
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,420
wouldn't make those kinds of decisions today.

320
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,780
I know,but,just...

321
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,790
Audrey...

322
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,780
I love you.

323
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,900
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

324
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,820
That's all I want.

325
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,260
We both know that you belong here,Jack.

326
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,560
At CTU,

327
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,440
doing what you do best.

328
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,720
And thank God

329
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,820
there are people like you

330
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,540
who can deal with that world...

331
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,570
But I can't.

332
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,330
Please don't say that.

333
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,210
Oh,Jack.

334
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,270
Oh,Jack.

335
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,330
I love you.

336
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,840
But after today,it's just...

337
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,180
It won't work.

338
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,900
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,430
This is Bauer.

341
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,000
Jack,it's David Palmer.

342
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,050
Yes,Mr. President.

343
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,740
Words cannot express the debt this country owes you.

344
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,370
Thank you,sir.

345
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,270
Jack,this is hard for me,

346
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,810
but I don't seem to have a choice.

347
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,410
The Chinese have proof

348
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,570
that you led the assault on their consulate.

349
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,780
What kind of proof?

350
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,240
Howard Bern made a full confession.

351
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,630
He identified you as the agent in charge.

352
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,620
And now the Chinese want me.

353
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,230
That's right. And we have no choice but to comply.

354
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,600
I see.

355
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,910
But what they really want is for you to implicate the government.

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,910
Mr. President,that will never happen.

357
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,950
I know that.

358
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,830
They'll put you on trial,

359
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,690
propagandize about American arrogance...

360
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,020
then put you in prison.

361
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,150
I understand.

362
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,150
Jack,this is unfair,to say the least,

363
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,790
and I'm ashamed of my part in it.

364
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,340
But I promise you this:

365
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,640
I will make it my life's purpose to bring you back

366
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,890
to American soil as soon as humanly possible.

367
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,220
I know you'll do what you can,sir.

368
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,330
The Secret Service is sending over an agent to CTU.

369
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,690
He'll place you under house arrest,

370
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,610
but you'll have some time to put your affairs in order.

371
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,160
Jack,my friend,I wish there was something else I could say.

372
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,620
Mr. President,you're doing what has to be done.

373
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,070
So will I.

374
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,410
I know you will.

375
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,170
Thank you,Jack.

376
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,720
Thank you,sir

377
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,240
This is a messy situation.

378
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,410
Even if Bauer doesn't implicate the President

379
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,030
in the attack on the consulate,

380
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,180
there are other problems.

381
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,910
Bauer is Special Advisor to the Secretary of Defense,

382
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,260
which makes him a high-value prisoner.

383
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,630
A gold mine of information.

384
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,040
The Chinese could squeeze him dry.

385
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,410
You're right.

386
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,790
Plus,the Chinese could share the information

387
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,260
with any intelligence agency in the world.

388
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,370
Eventually,what they get out of Bauer

389
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,170
could find its way into the hands of terrorists.

390
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,400
This could set us back years.

391
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,220
So the bottom line is...

392
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,520
I don't think you need me to spell that out for you.

393
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,260
I assume this isn't coming from President Logan.

394
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,640
Absolutely not.

395
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,980
He's expressly forbidden it.

396
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,680
But that doesn't mean he'd be sorry if it happened.

397
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,960
So any investigation into Bauer's death...

398
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,680
Will be brief and superficial.

399
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,300
I'll see to it personally.

400
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,400
Fine. I'll take care of it.

401
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,400
Good.

402
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,620
The President ordered Jack be extradited,not murdered.

403
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,420
Cummings wants Bauer dead so the Chinese can't question him.

404
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,350
President Logan shut him down.

405
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,570
We were both there.

406
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,890
It was a weak rebuke,at best.

407
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,420
This is still conjecture on your part,

408
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,040
based on one side of a conversation.

409
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,000
I know what I heard,and I know Cummings. You don't.

410
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,000
You really think he's capable of doing something like this?

411
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,540
He's been doing Logan's dirty work for the last 15 years.

412
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,690
Logan's gotten used to looking the other way.

413
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,130
I'd tell the President myself,

414
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,670
but he won't listen to me.

415
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,040
If you don't intervene now,it may be too late.

416
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,980
...and the Prime Minister is offering

417
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,900
to host a conference in London

418
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,060
for improving the flow of intelligence information among nations.

419
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,320
Tell him I accept his gracious offer.

420
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,010
Maybe you should tell him yourself,sir.

421
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,280
I think he wants to congratulate you personally

422
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,100
for steering the country so effectively

423
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,870
in its time of crisis.

424
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,910
Set up a call.

425
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,260
Yes. sir.

426
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,530
David.

427
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,160
I have been overwhelmed

428
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,920
by the outpouring of goodwill from heads of state

429
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,430
around the world.

430
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,060
Well-deserved,Mr. President.

431
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,910
You played a role,David.

432
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,530
You played a role.

433
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,430
Thank you,sir.

434
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,820
So what can I do for you?

435
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,410
Would you excuse us?

436
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,340
I'd like a moment alone with the President.

437
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,120
Sir,I have reason to believe

438
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,590
that your security chief may be preempting your decision

439
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,750
to hand Jack Bauer over to the Chinese.

440
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,910
Preempting me how?

441
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,230
By killing him before they can take custody.

442
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,820
Oh,for God's sake,David,

443
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,430
Cummings was just speaking hypothetically.

444
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,750
You can't take that at face value.

445
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,560
Besides which,I told him it wasn't an option.

446
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,140
All I'm asking you to do,sir,

447
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,150
is to talk to Cummings,

448
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,770
and make sure he understands your order.

449
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,070
David,I can't indulge some half-baked conspiracy...

450
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,450
I think I've earned the privilege

451
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,190
of having my concerns taken seriously.

452
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,050
You have.

453
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,340
But it's also no secret that your presidency

454
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,490
was infected with a certain level of paranoia

455
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,840
and scandal.

456
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,150
I won't allow that in my administration.

457
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,360
Questioning my security chief

458
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,030
would not only undermine his authority-

459
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,380
it would compromise mine,as well.

460
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,920
Hear no evil...

461
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,410
I beg your pardon?

462
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,510
You heard me.

463
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,390
David,thank you again for your assistance today,

464
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,250
but it's time for you to go back to civilian life

465
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,380
and let me do my job.

466
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,150
Hi,Jack.

467
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,650
Hey.

468
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,380
I just found out that Logan's going to make you take the fall

469
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,880
for everything that happened at the Chinese consulate.

470
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,380
No one's making me do anything.

471
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,680
The President didn't have a choice.

472
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,390
Yeah? Well,that doesn't make it fair,does it?

473
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,690
It is what it is.

474
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,430
This is Bauer.

475
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,890
Jack,are you still at CTU?

476
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,070
Yes,sir. Tony Almeida's just about to debrief me.

477
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,090
Listen to me very carefully.

478
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,320
Do not turn yourself in.

479
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,360
The man they sent to take you into custody

480
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,630
has orders to kill you.

481
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,810
Orders from who?

482
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,510
Someone in Logan's camp.

483
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,970
They think the Chinese will break you.

484
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,590
Logan authorize this?

485
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,480
Not directly,but he won't do anything to stop it.

486
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,780
Now,listen to me.

487
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,750
Get out of there now.

488
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,830
Thank you,sir.

489
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,900
Bill Buchanan,Regional Director of Division,Los Angeles.

490
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,670
Dale Spaulding,Secret Service.

491
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,860
You'll have to sign this before I take Bauer.

492
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,810
What is it?

493
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,770
Chain of custody authorization.

494
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,810
I'm not signing anything until Bauer's been debriefed.

495
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,940
When that happens,he's all yours.

496
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,600
Fair enough.

497
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,790
We'd be burying a million Americans right now

498
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,130
if it wasn't for Jack Bauer.

499
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,020
He's a hero.

500
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,400
I'm sure he is.

501
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,550
I'm just following orders.

502
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,210
I want him treated with the respect he deserves.

503
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,660
Of course.

504
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,780
Tony's on line one. He says it's urgent.

505
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,410
Something to do with Jack.

506
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,000
Buchanan.

507
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,200
Bill,it's Tony.

508
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,610
Jack escaped.

509
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,540
Escaped?

510
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,110
He took me by surprise. There was nothing I could do.

511
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:24,830
Damn it.

512
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,790
Look,he's still inside the building,

513
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,370
somewhere in Section C.

514
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,130
I'm the one who ordered the lockdown.

515
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,130
I'll be right there.

516
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,430
All right.

517
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,400
Bauer's trying to get away.

518
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,880
Jack disabled the surveillance feed a minute ago.

519
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,710
Were you able to make visual contact before that?

520
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,270
Yes,he's still in Section C.

521
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,090
Jack was willing to turn himself over to the Chinese.

522
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,530
What happened?

523
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,740
I can't say for sure,

524
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,990
but he did get a phone call.

525
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,860
Who from?

526
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,360
I don't know. I was waiting for him to finish up.

527
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,210
Next thing I know,I'm on the ground.

528
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,160
He cold-cocked me.

529
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,770
Does Bauer have a weapon? Yeah.

530
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,440
How many entrances and exits?

531
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,750
Four. They're all blocked off.

532
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,000
We'll try to punch through 'em.

533
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,250
Yeah,but I have two guards posted at each point.

534
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,790
I'm not taking any chances.

535
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,260
What are you doing? Going after him.

536
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,060
BUCHANAN: Wait a second.

537
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,180
I've got orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.

538
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,250
I intend to execute those orders.

539
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,740
This building is my jurisdiction.

540
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,270
SPAULDING: You lost jurisdiction when you lost Bauer.

541
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,060
If you want me to stand down,call the President.

542
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,840
Otherwise,stay out of my way.

543
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,830
But I'm going with you.

544
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,620
No,you're not. I'm doing this alone.

545
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,510
Either you take Tony,

546
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,820
or you're not going in.

547
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,630
Follow me.

548
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,330
Jack,it's Tony. Are you in here?

549
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,170
Let me talk to you! There's got to be a way out of this!

550
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,580
Jack,give it up!

551
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,330
Stay out of my way.

552
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,610
This is over!

553
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,980
I'm going to go bring Jack out.

554
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,480
You want to stop me,you can shoot me in the back.

555
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,870
Jack,I'm putting my weapon down.

556
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,210
I'm coming in.

557
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,100
Jack?

558
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,680
Jack!

559
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,610
He's dead.

560
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,630
You killed him.

561
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,880
He was shooting at us. He was aiming wide.

562
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,170
He was laying down cover fire.

563
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,090
If he wanted to hit us,he'd have hit us.

564
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,480
Oh,my God,Jack.

565
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,660
You killed him,you son of a bitch! You killed him!

566
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,380
Get him out of here! Take him to the Situation Room.

567
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,770
I'm sorry.

568
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,310
God,Jack.

569
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,200
Give me the epinephrine.

570
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,250
I hope it's not too late.

571
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,490
He really looks dead.

572
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,580
MICHELLE: That was the idea,Chloe.

573
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,570
How fast is it supposed to take effect?

574
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,350
Come on,Jack!

575
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,250
Damn!

576
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,160
Tony...

577
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,290
Come on,Jack! Damn it!

578
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,670
Can you hear me?

579
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,220
You know where you are?

580
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,440
Yeah.

581
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,580
All right,Chloe,

582
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,090
I need you to run interference with the local coroner

583
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,510
until we can switch bodies.

584
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,840
Make sure their database synchs up with Jack's information.

585
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,030
That won't cover the autopsy.

586
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,870
There's not going to be an autopsy.

587
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,890
They wanted Jack dead. Now he's dead.

588
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,470
AUDREY: Bill...

589
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,670
I just talked to my father.

590
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,080
He said that Jack was being handed over

591
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,630
to the Chinese government?

592
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,890
He was supposed to be...

593
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,050
but he tried to escape.

594
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,450
I don't understand.

595
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,700
Neither do I.

596
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,770
No.

597
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,730
Audrey...

598
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,690
No,don't say it.

599
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,730
No.

600
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,350
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,240
All right,we're clear.

602
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,410
You sure you're okay,Jack?

603
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,130
Yeah,I'm fine.

604
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,810
You both need to get back to CTU

605
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,160
before anyone gets suspicious.

606
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,350
Tony,you can drop me off anywhere up there.

607
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,950
All right.

608
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,020
We've secured your new identity.

609
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,450
It should help you get across the border.

610
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,690
Okay.

611
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,960
Did you get me a clean phone?

612
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,150
Yeah. Here's a scramble filter.

613
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,310
You can talk up to one minute undetected.

614
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,280
I can't thank you both enough for everything.

615
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,740
You got to get going.

616
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,110
Jack...

617
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,860
Be careful.

618
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,810
Yeah.

619
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,560
You,too.

620
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,960
Thank you both for everything.

621
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,720
Palmer.

622
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,180
Mr. President,this is Jack Bauer.

623
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,260
You threaded the eye of the needle.

624
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,680
I had some help,sir.

625
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,440
I wanted to thank you

626
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,580
for advising me of the situation.

627
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,300
Mr. President,you saved my life.

628
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,310
I'm only sorry it came to this.

629
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,860
Me,too,sir.

630
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,460
I just wanted to let you know that I was out.

631
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,220
I'm glad.

632
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,280
This is probably the last time we'll ever speak.

633
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,850
Jack,you do understand,when you hang up,

634
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:43,010
for all intents and purposes,Jack Bauer's dead.

635
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,950
I understand that,sir.

636
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,200
Mr. President,it's been an honor.

637
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,860
Same for me,my friend.
