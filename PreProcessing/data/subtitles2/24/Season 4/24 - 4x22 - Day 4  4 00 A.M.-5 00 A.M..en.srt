1
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,279
Previously On 24

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,800
David, what have you done?

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Excuse me, sir?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,200
I just got a call from the secretary of state telling me about
a covert action against the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,400
That's correct. I sanctioned it.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
You authorized an attack on their consulate! That's a military engagement.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
It was a covert operation,

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
We marched onto Chinese soil,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,200
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and in the process the
Chinese consul was killed.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Mr. President

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,500
if we don't find that warhead before it's deployed,
ten million americans could face annihilation.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,100
And we could be at war
with a Billion Chinese.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,400
Is he going to make it?

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,700
We're going to do the best we can.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,100
I just need him coherent long
enough to get the information about Marwan and the missing warhead.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,100
I know, Jack. You already made me aware of that when you
forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,657
You made a choice that killed Paul,
and I'm trying to deal with it.

19
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,863
We both have a job, let's just do it.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,100
I know that he worked
with Marwan on the warhead. Now he needs to tell us where it is.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,700
He doesn't konw. But he knows where Marwan might be.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,100
A factory on sixth.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,957
They're looking for the
warhead in their cities.

24
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:12,402
They have no idea that it's
going to be delivered by missile.

25
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:13,837
Start the sequence.

26
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:15,569
We're done here.

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,400
They can't stop us now.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
I've been waiting for this.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,200
You're too late.

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Kill me.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,000
That won't stop the missile.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,100
Tony, can you see this?

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,100
Yeah.

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
Can you get a source of the transmission?

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
No, Jack- it's on
an encrypted uplink.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
There's no way to trace it.

37
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,073
The following takes place
between 4:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Tony,it\'s Jack,have you got a lock on the missle?

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,000
No,we\'re still trying to find it,Jack,what\'re you gonna do with Marwan?

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,100
-We\'re gonna scan the building one more time, then I\'m gonna
bring him in to the CTU, I want you to prep a holding room.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Tony I\'m going out for comm,if you need me,get me on my cell.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Alright,you got it!

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
I want you to try to decode his files,

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,800
I\'m gonna go prep the teams to look at the building.

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,200
Unbelievable,

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,200
how the hell did they manage to assemble a missle capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
S-series cruise missle,

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,400
,steath technology,

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,600
they must\'ve smuggled it in piece by piece and then assembled it downside.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
If it\'s stealth,we can\'t track it by radar,

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,600
what about the targets?

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,900
Pull it up.

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,700
An S-series has a range of 1800 miles

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,100
which means the warhead could be delieverd from the midwest anywhere in the continent to the U.S.

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,600
This missle traveling up speed 600 miles an hour

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,300
which means it can hit the target in either coast under three hours

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,300
Let\'s assume that it\'s heading for the coast,

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
it\'s not there,could be here,start at any time.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,000
There are no files on this,

60
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,800
he just received what\'s scrambled down alike.

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,700
What else did you find?

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Nothing,it was clean,

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
just the laptop and the cell phone.

64
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,100
-Ok,take this (encrypted) outta the phone,
upload it to CTU,see if any other traces.

65
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,600
You got it

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,000
This is Bauer.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:16,800
Jack,

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
this is president Logan.

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,400
I\'m just been told a cruise missle,has just been launched containing the nuclear warhead.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,300
Yes,sir,that\'s correct

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Our millitary tracking devices are doing everything they can to find the trajectory of the missle

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,400
,but we don\'t have a lot to go on.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,500
What about Marwan,Jack?

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,300
You think that he will break?

75
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,600
That won\'t be easy,sir.

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,800
He\'s planned and organized everything that\'s happened today,

77
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,300
he\'s committed to his cult,he\'s prepared to die.

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,300
I know that you are doing your best,keep me posted.

79
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes,sir. I will.

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,400
-Let the Joint Chiefs know the situation,
but tell him that this should be eliminated to the intelligence community only.

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,900
Sir,

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,500
if the nuclear missle has been launched,we have to assume the washington is its target.

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
What are our options?

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,600
We don\'t have many.

85
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Our first priority is to establish a continuity government
and start a quiet evacuation of government personnel in the city.

86
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,100
Bring the cabinet members and the speaker of the house to the bunker,

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
the congress and Pentagon should be taking to the mountain safe facility.

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,800
Right.

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,100
Mike,

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,200
let them know that this is category one emergency,

91
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,200
tell them nothing more,

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
we can\'t afford the information leak.

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
David,

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,900
public needs to be warned,cities need to be evacuated.

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,600
Not yet,

96
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,000
let\'s see what Bauer comes up at first.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
He will die before he talks to us.

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,300
I know.

99
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,400
Stand down.

100
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,500
You and I both know that all I wanna do right now is kill you.

101
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,100
But I have my orders.

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,200
We\'re running outta time. You win. I\'ve been instructed to ask you what you want?

103
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,200
What I want is already happening.

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,900
-The death and destruction of the innocent life is means to the end.
Why don\'t we just skip to the end.

105
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,400
To the end?

106
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
Everything that you did today,

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,400
you (defer) a reason for your people,what do you want to change?

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,600
I have no interest having a political discussion with you.

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,800
-I\'m on an unique position to make things happen,
I have the ears of the president of the U.S. right now.

110
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,500
You have the power to make any kind of the deal that you want.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,300
And I promise you,

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,600
you will do more for you and your people if you cooperate with me than if you let that missle hit its target

113
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
You tell me where the missle is headed,

114
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,000
you help me to stop it,

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,800
then I guarantee you that you will talk to the president,

116
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,400
and he will listen to you,he has no choice.

117
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,900
Right here,right now,

118
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
you have the chance to get what you want.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
I\'ve already had,agent Bauer.

120
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,200
Of till this day

121
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
every elected official

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
and citizen of America

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,100
will know that america can not intervene our lives nor countries

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,700
with impunity.

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,500
Besides,your presidency means only one to mention-

126
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,800
evil.

127
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600
That\'s you see us?

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Yes,

129
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
and vulnerable.

130
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,700
Chloe,

131
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,100
come here.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,900
What?

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
You\'re never gonna believe what I just found,

134
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,100
I got names of some calls received on Marwan\'s cellphone

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,900
take a look.

136
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,200
Richard Heler

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,400
That\'s right secetary of denfence Heler's son

138
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,100
called Marwan a week ago.

139
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,900
Did you tell anyone yet?

140
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,500
No.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Just you.

142
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,700
I'll let Buchanan know.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,700
With every minute that passes, the missile's target zone widens.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,100
We need to get updates from regional teams.

145
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to hear this.

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Edgar just pulled a name off Marwan's cell phone.

147
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,100
It was from a call he received last week.

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,800
Who called him?

149
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Richard Heller.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Are you sure?

151
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,200
We ran the number and it came up as originating from Richard Heller's cell phone.

153
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,100
That must be how Marwan knew where secretary Heller was going to be yesterday morning.

154
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,900
You think Richard helped to plan his own dad's kidnapping?

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,500
I don't know.

156
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
Where is he now?

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Well, it's 4:00 A.M.

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
He's at home asLeep, I guess.

159
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,300
Where does he live, Chloe?

160
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,300
Van nuys.

161
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
We have field teams in the area?

162
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't know.

163
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
I'll pull it up on the ip phone.

164
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,300
Yes, we do.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Dispatch them.

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,300
I'll call secretary Heller, tell him his son's being brought back in.

167
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,600
Chloe, does Audrey know about this?

168
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,200
No.

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
It's more of a management conversation, don't you think?

170
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
This is o'brian.

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Your team has been issued new orders.

172
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
You are to dispatch immediately to van nuys.

173
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Audrey, you got a minute?

174
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,800
Yeah, sure.

175
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,100
What is it?

176
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,600
It's about your brother, Richard.

177
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,600
Is he all right?

178
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,400
I assume he is, yeah.

179
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,400
What do you mean?

180
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,500
We just found out that Habib Marwan got a call from Richard's cell phone a week ago.

181
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
I'm sorry, but that's absurd.

182
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,000
We don't know what it means yet,

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,600
but Buchanan is sending a team over to pick Richard up right now.

184
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,600
Tony, my brother was already brought in once today and he was cleared.

185
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah, I know.

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
But this call definitely connects him to Marwan and the missile.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,100
Look, I don't know how he got mixed up in this, but my brother is not a terrorist.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Audrey,

189
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Richard's phone number was found in the received registry of Marwan's sim card.

190
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Does my father know about this?

191
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,500
Buchanan's calling him right now.

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,000
All right.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,900
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,000
All right.

195
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll tell him, yeah.

196
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Jack, we got something.

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,300
W hat?

198
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,200
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.

199
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,900
We're sure about this?

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,700
Yeah, they're bringing him to CTU.

201
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
I want to question this kid myself.

202
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
We need to get back there now.

203
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Put the suspect in the vehicle.

204
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,900
We're headed back to CTU now.

205
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,900
It doesn't matter where you take me.

206
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah, we'll see about that.

207
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,300
This is Bauer.

208
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,900
Jack, were you able to get anything out of Marwan?

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
No, we're going to bring him back to CTU.

210
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,100
We think we got a better chance of breaking him there.

211
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,200
We're about ten minutes out.

212
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Curtis, you okay?

213
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah!

214
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Can you see the shooters?

215
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
They're on the roof behind us.

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,600
Go!

217
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody!

218
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,600
Perimeter teams, Marwan's escaped!

219
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
He's headed towards the southwest sector.

220
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,900
Chloe, what have you got on Marwan?

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,400
Nothing-

222
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
he already ditched the transpo vehicle and we can't find him on satellite.

223
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
How did his people get into that area?

224
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
They didn't-they must have been there before us.

225
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Marwan secured the location.

226
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,700
All right,

227
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,500
have perimeter teams comb the nearby buildings for remaining hostiles,

228
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,400
then shift personnel to tracking the missile.

229
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
We lost him, Jack.

230
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Damn it, Tony, how?

231
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,700
They dumped their vehicle on the freeway.

232
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,300
In the chaos, Marwan must have gotten into another car and driven off.

233
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
We're trying to analyze the satellite right now,

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,300
but the images are too noisy.

235
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,400
How does Buchanan want to handle this?

236
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm here, Jack.

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,700
Finding Marwan is becoming less likely.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,900
With that missile in the air,

239
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
we have to follow primary leads only.

240
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,600
Right now that's Richard Heller.

241
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Has he arrived yet?

242
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,100
No, our team's on the way to get him.

243
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,300
He'll be back here momentarily.

244
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,800
Bill, I want to interrogate this kid myself.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,600
I understand.

246
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'll have him ready for you.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,100
Okay, we're on our way in.

248
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Curtis, we need to back to CTU.

249
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,100
They lost Marwan.

250
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,500
We're going to have to track him from there.

251
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
What did Buchanan say?

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
Richard Heller's in first position.

253
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,700
We're going to interrogate him.

254
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,800
Mr. President.

255
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,100
Please, everybody, be seated.

256
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,300
I would like to apologize for the abruptness of your removal from your homes and your offices.

257
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Please know that every precaution had to be taken to ensure the secrecy of your arrival.

258
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
The U.S. Has been thrown into a category one emergency.

259
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,400
A cruise missile containing a nuclear warhead has been launched and is now headed for,

260
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
we believe, a major U.S. City.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,900
Very possibly washington D.C.

262
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,100
Now,

263
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,900
all branches of the military have been alerted and they're doing everything in their power to locate the missile and to intercept it.

264
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,000
Excuse me, sir.

265
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,900
You're saying that not only do we not know what the missile's target is,

266
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,700
but you don't even know

267
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,900
where the missile is?

268
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,600
That's correct.

269
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,000
When do you plan to inform the public?

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,700
As of this time,

271
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,500
we feel that informing the public wouldn't be in the country's best interest.

272
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,200
"We" meaning who, Mr. President?

273
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,500
I feel that way, Mr. Speaker.

274
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Doesn't the public have a right to know the truth?

275
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,300
That's all I have for now.

276
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
When I know more, an update will be given.

277
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Thank you.

278
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,700
Mr. President.

279
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Yes, Don.

280
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,900
S ir,

281
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,200
I do not wish to question your decision in front of the cabinet,

282
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,800
but I think that you're making a grave mistake in not alerting the public.

283
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Look, I've thought a lot about this and...

284
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm certain it's the right course.

285
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,400
Well, if I may say so, sir, you do not seem certain.

286
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,900
It's a difficult day for all of us, Don.

287
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Now, if you'll excuse me.

288
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,200
Mike,

289
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,900
what's going on here?

290
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,100
Meaning what?

291
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,800
Logan was sworn in a few hours ago,

292
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,800
we're under a massive terrorist attack-he needs all the help he can get.

293
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,400
He understands that and he's seeking advice from everywhere.

294
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Not from his cabinet.

295
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,700
Or the congressional leadership.

296
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,100
Give it time, Don.

297
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Give it time.

298
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Tactical's at Richard's house,

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
they're going through his things right now.

300
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,600
What about Jack?

301
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Jack and Curtis are on their way back.

302
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Someone has to tell Audrey that Jack's going to be interrogating her brother.

303
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,300
Audrey's not going to want to let Jack near her brother.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,800
It can't be helped.

305
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,500
If Richard knows something about that missile...

306
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,800
it's funny, this morning Jack and Audrey were planning their future.

307
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,600
Now he's responsible for her husband's death,

308
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,000
and he may have to torture her brother.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,500
And yet...

310
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,700
every move he's made has been the right one.

311
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Not if he wanted to be with her.

312
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Look, Michelle...

313
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,800
everything that's happened here today,

314
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
it's been hard going through it with you again.

315
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,600
It's been hard for me, too.

316
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,600
And I...

317
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,700
look at what this job does the people in our positions,

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,100
and I realize...

319
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,000
I want us to be together again,

320
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
but it's go to be away from all this.

321
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,900
You want us to leave our jobs?

322
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
We've spent the last 12 years of our lives doing this.

323
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Where would we go?

324
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,100
What would we do?

325
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,100
I don't care.

326
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,200
People start over every day, if it's important to them.

327
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,700
You're asking me to leave the only thing I've ever done.

328
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Yes...

329
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
I am.

330
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,000
This is beyond belief!

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,300
I cannot be brought here!

332
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,300
Audrey, you got to get me out of here.

333
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
These guys broke into my house.

334
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,400
This is so illegal.

335
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,700
All right, Richard, listen.

336
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,600
Just calm down, okay?

337
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Listen to me.

338
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Your phone number came up on the cell phone of a terrorist, all right?

339
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,100
That's what they said.

340
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,000
That's insane.

341
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,600
You know that.

342
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,200
Audrey.

343
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,400
Now listen, ok, just right...

344
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,700
Audrey.

345
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,200
Yes.

346
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
They have to get him into holding now.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Audrey!

348
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,700
Audrey, don't let them do this!

349
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Don't let them do this to me!

350
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Who's interrogating him?

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Jack.

352
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,800
What?

353
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,100
You are not going to do this.

354
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,400
You are not going to torture my brother.

355
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,200
I'll be right in there.

356
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,400
I don't want to hurt Richard, but we're out of time-

357
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,300
he knows something, and I'm going to find out what it is.

358
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,500
And what if he doesn't?

359
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,000
You're aware that he called Marwan.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
It came up on his cell phone.

361
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
There has got to be an explanation for that.

362
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,700
Let me talk to him.

363
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,100
You honestly believe that you can interrogate your own brother?

364
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,200
It's because he's my brother,

365
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,500
maybe I can get something out of him that you can't, Jack.

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Please, just give me five minutes.

367
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,200
Please.

368
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Take five minutes.

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,700
Thank you.

370
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Mike.

371
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,800
Don.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,900
How's, uh, President Logan managing?

373
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Given the circumstances, he's doing very well.

374
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,500
I noticed that ex-President Palmer is here with him.

375
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,700
Yes, he brought the former President in to advise.

376
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,200
Yeah, well, that's probably a good idea.

377
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,700
Palmer's been at the helm in this kind of crisis before.

378
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,800
He knows how to lead.

379
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,400
President Logan doesn't have any problem leading,

380
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,500
if that's what you're getting at.

381
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh, no, not at all.

382
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,100
It's just that if he's not going to ask his cabinet for help,

383
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,700
the leadership, it comforts me, somewhat, that he's in good hands.

384
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,300
Is there something else you wanted to say, Don?

385
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah, yeah, there is.

386
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,200
The people elected john Keeler to run this country.

387
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,500
In his absence, Logan is expected to take over.

388
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
But if he's not up to the task,

389
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,600
mike, it is I, speaker of the house, and not David Palmer, who steps up.

390
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,900
Understood.

391
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,200
And let me assure you, that's not the case.

392
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,200
Logan is in complete control.

393
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,000
Excuse me, Don, I got to get back.

394
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,400
Sure.

395
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,900
Excuse me, Mr. President.

396
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,000
We may have a problem.

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,600
What is it?

398
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,700
Don Ashton.

399
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,300
He's been asking a number of questions and raising concerns as to President Palmer's role here.

400
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
That's too bad.

401
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,600
We have more important things to worry about at the moment.

402
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,300
Sir, as the speaker of the house,

403
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,700
he can create problems which you don't need right now.

404
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,000
Mike's right, sir.

405
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,100
Don's very ambitious.

406
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,600
Now that he's next in line to the presidency,

407
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
he'll look to exploit any angle he can.

408
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,600
He won't put his ambition in front of national security.

409
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
No, he won't see it in those terms, sir.

410
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,400
In his eyes, national security and his personal ambition are one and the same.

411
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,000
What do we do?

412
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,100
Show him who's in charge.

413
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,300
everything set up?

414
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,300
Yeah, he's ready.

415
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,400
Let's do this.

416
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,600
Audrey!

417
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,500
Get me out of here.

418
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
Please, tell them I didn't do anything.

419
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Richard, I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay?

420
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,500
A missile carrying a nuclear warhead was launched by this man: Habib Marwan.

421
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,300
Tell me what you know about him.

422
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,500
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.

423
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,000
CTU has proof that you called him last week, tuesday at 4:00 A.M.

424
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,400
I don't know any Habib Marwan or anything about a missile.

425
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
You have got to believe me, Audrey.

426
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,100
Richard, that missile is in the air right now, heading toward a city.

427
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,000
Please, Richard, just tell me what you know.

428
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I told you, I don't know anything.

429
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Why'd you make that phone call last week?

430
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,200
I didn't make a phone call, Audrey.

431
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,300
What's happened with my son so far?

432
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,600
We decided to let Audrey talk to him first.

433
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
They just got started.

434
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
Has he confessed to anything yet?

435
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,000
No, sir.

436
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,300
Richard, it's not making sense.

437
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
That call was made.

438
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
Look, I don't know where you get your information,

439
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Audrey, but it's all bull.

440
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,700
His readings are spiking.

441
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,100
He's holding something back.

442
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,800
Richard...

443
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Richard, I am begging you to talk to me, all right?

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,500
If you don't,

445
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,100
there is a man who will come in here and he will get the information from you.

446
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,100
I saw him torture someone today.

447
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,600
It's what he's trained to do.

448
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
He won't stop hurting you until you tell him the truth.

449
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Please.

450
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,800
Don't let them do this to me.

451
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Tell me what you know and they won'T.

452
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't know what you want from me.

453
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,800
I don'T.

454
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
Richard, look at me, look at me.

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
We have a chance to fix this.

456
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
This is not working.

457
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,000
We don't have time to coddle him.

458
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,900
Open up.

459
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,700
I don't care if he is my son, he's playing games now.

460
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,700
All right, Richard, this has gone far enough.

461
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,500
Either you tell us what we want to know or I will let them use every piece of equipment they have to drag it out of you.

462
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,900
You understand that?

463
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,700
Dad, don'T...

464
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Audrey, leave the room.

465
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,700
Dad, please...

466
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,100
now!

467
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,900
I mean it.

468
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,500
Richard, I want you to tell them everything you know, please.

469
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Now what's it going to be, Richard?

470
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,900
Go to hell.

471
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
I didn't do anything wrong, I don't have to tell you anything.

472
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,000
There's a nuclear warhead going to detonate somewhere over this country.

473
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,600
Those lost lives will be on your head.

474
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,300
You will be a murderer.

475
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,200
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.

476
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,600
I swear.

477
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,000
What did you do, Richard?

478
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,500
Tell me what you did.

479
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,000
A week ago, I was...

480
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
I was at a bar and...

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
there was this girl and her boyfriend...

482
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,200
okay?

483
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,500
Right.

484
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
What were their names?

485
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,700
I don't know.

486
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,000
They wanted to party and I...

487
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,700
we...

488
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,200
we went back to my place.

489
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,000
We got high...

490
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,200
then...

491
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,600
I guess there was time for one of them to make a call on my phone.

492
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,600
How?

493
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
When we were in bed.

494
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,400
So while you were in bed with her,

495
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,600
he used your phone in the other room.

496
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
He wasn't the one in the other room, dad.

497
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,400
I was with him.

498
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,400
She must have been the one that made the call.

499
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
So, you were set up?

500
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah.

501
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,300
I guess so, dad.

502
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,300
Did they leave you with a number or an address?

503
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,600
No.

504
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,600
What kind of a car were they driving?

505
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,300
They didn't have one.

506
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,200
I drove.

507
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,600
Where did you drop them off afterwards?

508
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,100
I didn'T.

509
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,600
They took a cab.

510
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Do you remember the name of the cab company?

511
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
No, dad, I don'T.

512
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Get in touch with every cab company that works in the area.

513
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,700
I want their log books.

514
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,000
Get me a sketch artist now.

515
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,100
I'll run it.

516
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,500
Take over.

517
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,400
So now you know.

518
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
I suppose you're even more disgusted with me, huh, dad?

519
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,500
This is not about how you choose to live your life, son.

520
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
This is about how you've put this country in jeopardy.

521
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
If you had told us this information yesterday,

522
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,600
maybe these terrorist attacks would not have occurred.

523
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
No, don't you put that on me, dad.

524
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,000
'Cause yesterday I didn't know that that night had anything to do with these attacks.

525
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,200
You should have told us everything.

526
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,500
I'll wait outside.

527
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,000
You made a profound mistake today, Richard.

528
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Based on this information here,

529
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,700
we can start to develop a contingency plan.

530
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
You got the cab company?

531
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,700
Better than that.

532
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
We got the cab driver.

533
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,100
He dropped the couple off at an apartment complex in panorama city called the mercerwood.

534
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,300
Did you talk to the apartment manager?

535
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,100
Yes, we gave him a description of the guy and the girl.

536
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,400
He says he knows what unit they're in.

537
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,600
Okay, Jack, you take this.

538
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm gonna need our best field ops.

539
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,000
I want Curtis and castle.

540
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
I'm going to need Curtis here with me.

541
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,700
Then you got to give me Tony.

542
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,400
All right.

543
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,100
What about the phone call to Marwan?

544
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,800
I used our digital comm software to analyze Richard's phone.

545
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,200
The phone call to Marwan activated a listen-in.

546
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
He was able to hear all of Richard's calls after that night.

547
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
That's why Marwan knew that secretary Heller was visiting Richard off book yesterday.

548
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,500
Anything on the missile?

549
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
We've been running military protocols, but so far nothing.

550
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
Do we know if President Logan is going to make an announcement?

551
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,500
As of now, the President still thinks that would do more harm than good.

552
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
Please, as you were, everybody.

553
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,400
Be seated.

554
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,900
Gentlemen and ladies,

555
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
considering the crisis that we face today,

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,500
I felt it prudent to enlist the assistance of ex-President Palmer.

557
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,700
In what capacity, sir?

558
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,500
Excuse me.

559
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,500
Sir, everybody in this room has a title and specific function.

560
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,200
Exactly what position will President Palmer be occupying?

561
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,100
I'm here solely as an advisor.

562
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,600
Not only to the President, but to anyone here who requests my counsel.

563
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,500
President Palmer's outside the chain of command,

564
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,300
if that's what you're asking me, Don.

565
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Asking for a clarification, sir.

566
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,200
The missile carrying the nuclear warhead was launched from a location in central iowa.

567
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,700
It's becoming more and more likely that the target is on or near one of the coasts.

568
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,100
It's clearly going to be new york or D.C.

569
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,100
Why aren't we evacuating those two cities?

570
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,400
I disagree, jennie.

571
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,300
It's not clear.

572
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,200
And if you start to evacuate these two cities,

573
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,800
then you may have an unauthorized mass exoduses of boston, philadelphia, baltimore, atlanta...

574
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,100
that's a situation I don't think the President should be dealing with.

575
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,100
Maybe the President should be telling us that himself.

576
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,100
Please, Mr. Speaker,

577
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,800
I've discussed this option with a number of domestic experts including President Palmer,

578
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,200
and that's my assessment as well.

579
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
What about air defense?

580
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,500
We going to stand by and let the airspace over these cities remain undefended?

581
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,200
We have a limited number of f-18 interceptor jets at our disposal.

582
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,700
They need to be augmenting the search for this missile,

583
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,400
and not deployed in a wait-and-see mode.

584
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,400
Mr. Palmer, I'm sure that we all appreciate your desire to help,

585
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,000
but the constitution has determined who the decision makers should be at this time.

586
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,600
I think you're overstepping your bounds.

587
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,000
In the first place, it's Mr. President, Don.

588
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,500
And it is the content of my statements you should be addressing.

589
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,100
David.

590
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,900
It's true, you are to be addressed as President.

591
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,700
It's an expression of respect,

592
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,100
but not a functional title.

593
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,700
I understand that, sir.

594
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,700
But you have to understand, I've been through this crisis before.

595
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,300
Yes, but we are here now.

596
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,300
The appointed and the lawful representatives of the people of the united states.

597
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,200
Mr. President...

598
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,400
David, there will be no more discussion on this matter.

599
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,800
Your point has been taken.

600
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,100
However, Ashton has made a good point, and I want to address his concerns.

601
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,700
Perhaps it's best if I excused myself.

602
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,600
Perhaps.

603
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,900
Ladies, gentlemen...

604
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
Mr. Speaker, I think you're right.

605
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,400
We'll put those jets over D.C.

606
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,000
And new york.

607
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,800
Did you see it on the inside feed?

608
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,500
Yes.

609
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,100
It went exactly as you'd hoped.

610
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,700
We won't have any more problems with Don Ashton today.

611
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,800
I hope you're right.

612
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,000
We'll be monitoring everything on three.

613
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,400
All right.

614
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,400
Make sure LAPD's there when we land.

615
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,000
We're going to need transport to the site.

616
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,400
They've already been called.

617
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,000
ok

618
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
Tony, wait.

619
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,100
I-I can'T...

620
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,000
I can't spend another day without you.

621
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm ready...

622
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,100
to leave here.

623
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,300
I'm ready to go with you.

624
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,300
Tony.

625
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,900
Be careful.

626
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,200
Right.

627
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,500
They're setting up a remote feed.

628
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,200
Richard's going to help Jack identify the suspects when they get onsite.

629
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,800
Then what?

630
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,500
Then they'll let him go.

631
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,800
His motives certainly weren't seditious.

632
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,900
Dad, I feel so lost.

633
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,500
I know, sweetheart.

634
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,400
Ms. Raines?

635
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes.

636
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,600
Jack Bauer's on line two for you.

637
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,200
Thank you.

638
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,900
You take it, sweetheart.

639
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,000
I'll be on the floor.

640
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,600
Hello.

641
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Audrey, it's Jack.

642
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,900
I know you don't want to talk to me right now,

643
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,200
but there are a few things I need to say.

644
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,100
All right.

645
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,500
Look, I know with everything that's happened today,

646
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,800
you've seen me do things that...

647
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,900
before now, you thought were unimaginable.

648
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,200
I would have been happy to skip today.

649
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,800
Yeah, me, too.

650
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,300
But the truth of it is,Audrey,

651
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,200
I never believed you could ever really love me if you'd known about everything I've done.

652
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,100
Jack, I-I can'T...

653
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,500
Audrey, please, let me finish.

654
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,600
These were the things that I was running away from.

655
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,800
That's why I moved to D.C.

656
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,900
That's why I stopped doing field work.

657
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,700
That's why i don't work at CTU.

658
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,500
All I know is that you're back in it, and it's too much for me, Jack.

659
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,300
I know.

660
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,300
I know...

661
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,200
the last thing i ever wanted to do was push you away from me.

662
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,500
God, Audrey, I love you,

663
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,000
but this is how the job has to be done.

664
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,400
I just want you to know how sorry I am that it had to involve you and the people you care about.

665
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
Look, you don't have to say anything now.

666
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Please, just promise me, as soon as this is over...

667
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,800
we can talk about everything that's happened.

668
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Audrey, please.

669
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,000
Jack.

670
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
I gotta call you back later, okay?

671
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,700
All right.

672
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah.

673
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,000
Jack, tactical's just got the schematics ready.

674
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
What are the approach parameters?

675
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
They want us to go in from the west.

676
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,600
Edgar.

677
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,700
This is the composite the sketch artist made based on Richard Heller's description.

678
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,700
Get it to Jack and Tony.

679
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,000
Will do.

680
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Now can we go?

681
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,800
We still have plenty of time to get to Marwan.

682
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
I don't like cutting it this close.

683
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,900
This is a sketch of the guy that Richard Heller described.

684
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,000
He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan,

685
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,800
so once we identify the suspects, it is vital that we take them alive.

686
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,100
Manning.

687
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Curtis, it's Jack.

688
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,000
We're getting ready to land.

689
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,100
Is everyone set?

690
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:02,700
Yeah.

691
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,400
We're all set.

692
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,300
Richard's ready to make a positive I.D.

693
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,100
Copy that.

694
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,800
I want you to stay on this channel.

695
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,600
You got it.

696
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,900
We're a go!.

697
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,400
I need you to make sure that no LAPD units go inside our established perimeter!

698
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,300
Am I clear?!

699
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,800
Yes sir!

700
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,900
Okay, let's go!

701
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,200
Are you ready?

702
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,000
They found us.

703
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,300
What are you talking about?

704
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,200
A helicopter just landed a block away.

705
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,100
So what?

706
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,400
So- they found us.

707
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,700
Damn it!

708
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
Hey, we can't go together.

709
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,900
Why not?

710
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Because one of us has to stay here in the apartment.

711
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,400
Why?

712
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,900
Because if they think that we're still here,

713
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,800
then it gives the other a chance to escape.

714
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,200
You've got to be joking.

715
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,200
One of us is going to get caught to save the other?

716
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Exactly.

717
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,100
It's gonna be you.

718
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Jack, what do you want to do?

719
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
Move in on the apartment immediately?

720
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,500
No, I want you and castle to take up positions here on the roof of the main building in the center of the complex.

721
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,800
Team A, B and C, acknowledge when you're in position.

722
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Team A on site (B C in position)

723
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,000
Copy that.

724
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,500
Let's go.

725
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,200
Okay.

726
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,400
Lapd, I need the entry code for the south gate.

727
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,300
I'm in.

728
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,200
Okay, I've got a visual on the apartment.

729
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
There's activity inside.

730
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,700
Macallan, meet me at the front door of the apartment.

731
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,000
Have your people cover us.

732
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,400
On my way.

733
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,200
Go.

734
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,000
Go.

735
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,600
Pick it.

736
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,600
It's ready.

737
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,600
Put your hands where I can see them!

738
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,000
Put your hands where I can see them now!

739
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,700
He's dead.

740
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Get a picture of him.

741
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,900
Send it back to CTU.

742
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,800
Got it.

743
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Tony, this is Jack.

744
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,900
Has anybody reported any outside movement?

745
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,600
No. Why?

746
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,900
The man is dead.

747
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,700
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

748
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,700
She couldn't have gotten past the perimeter teams.

749
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,300
I know, but there are plenty of other places to hide.

750
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,000
I want all teams to maintain their positions until we have time to search the other apartments.

751
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Roger that.

752
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,100
All teams, hold position.

753
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,300
Drop your gun.

754
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,000
All right!

755
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,100
All right.

756
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,300
Kick it away.

757
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,200
Look, he's injured.

758
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,400
Why don't you let him go?

759
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,500
You can take me instead.

760
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,100
Your two-way.

761
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,200
Turn around.

762
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,300
On your knees, hands on your head.

763
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,100
Cuff him.

764
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,300
Get up.

765
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,700
Curtis, you should have it.

766
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,600
Whoa.

767
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,400
Is that him?

768
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,500
Is that him?!

769
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,300
Yeah.

770
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,700
Jack, that's him.

771
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,000
We have a positive id on the picture.

772
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,000
Okay, thank you, Curtis.

773
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,400
Tactical, this is Bauer.

774
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,500
I need five teams of two to initiate a search of the complex.

775
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,400
Start with the outer buildings along the perimeter, move your way in.

776
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,000
Copy that, they're being deployed now.

777
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,900
Tony, this is Jack.

778
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,300
We're initiating the search.

779
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,300
Tony, do you copy?

780
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,700
Castle, why is Almeida not on comm?

781
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,700
Tony you copy? Tony come in!

782
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,900
All teams, this is Bauer.

783
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,600
Castle is down Almeida is missing.

784
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,300
I repeat: Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

785
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,400
Our communications have been compromised.

786
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,100
Move over to secondary frequency.

787
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,700
CTU, I need more tactical personnel now.

788
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
CTU, do you read?

789
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,000
Michelle.

790
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,500
You heard him, people.

791
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Shift profiles.

792
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,300
We may have a hostage situation.

793
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,400
Move.

794
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,900
Now!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
