Previously On 24

6
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:16,270
This is air force one
declaring an emergency.

7
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,761
We're not gonna make it.
I have to put it down now.

8
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:20,759
Chloe, what's happening?

9
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:22,725
Chloe!

10
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,110
Air force one is down.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,070
This may be him.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,590
It's the president.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,200
He's still alive.

14
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,864
I repeat, the president is alive.

15
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,548
Marwan has to be within a 50-mile radius...

16
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:39,978
Jack.

17
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:42,072
There's a higher priority
than finding Marwan.

18
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:42,825
What is it?

19
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,295
Recovering the nuclear football.

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,566
Didn't it go down with air force one?

21
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,624
The missile inflicted enough damage that the

22
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,445
plane left a trail of
debris as it went down.

23
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,668
A lot of things were sucked
out, including the football.

24
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:57,112
That case contains the codes and
locations of our entire nuclear arsenal.

25
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,415
What's the location of the football?

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,562
40 miles northeast of here
in the middle of the desert.

27
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:05,494
Air support!

28
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,822
Football is in the lead jeep headed north.

29
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:08,579
Take it out!

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,766
I'm in possession
of the football.

31
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,767
Three hostiles are down,

32
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,452
one escaped.

33
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,653
I'm not positive,
but I think it was Marwan.

34
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:24,969
There's some pages missing.

35
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,267
Tell me what the contents
are of the missing pages.

36
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:31,464
Jack, it's the red section which contains
warhead locations and activation codes.

37
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:33,798
If they get ahold of a
warhead and a matching

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,186
activation code, we will
not be able to stop them.

39
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:37,462
Mr. vice president...

40
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,256
President Keeler is alive.

41
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,439
But he's in critical condition.

42
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,201
Sir, I recommend you
invoke the 25th amendment

43
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,438
and take control of things
as soon as possible.

44
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:47,747
You're worried about him?

45
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:48,915
I am.

46
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:50,899
He seems unsure of himself.

47
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,194
I do solemnly swear that
I will faithfully execute

48
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:56,201
the office of the president
of the united states,

49
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,782
preserve, protect and defend the
constitution of the united states.

50
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:05,260
Mr. President, I have just
received a phone call from CTU.

51
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:09,776
Part of the nuclear football has
fallen into the hands of terrorists.

52
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:16,371
The following takes place
between 12:00 A.M. and 1:00 A.M.

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,200
Vice president Logan has
been sworn into office.

54
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:24,000
He's now president of the united states.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
His office called, they want
an update from us in 15 minutes.

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,500
We're working on several protocols
related to the plane crash.

57
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,900
What is he going to want to focus on?

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,072
He's going to want to know
how a stealth fighter was

59
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,300
stolen from one of our air
bases and, more to the point,

60
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:39,000
how it was able to take down air
force one with one of our own missiles.

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
Has he been briefed on Marwan?

62
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,400
He knows Marwan is the mastermind
behind today's events, yes.

63
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:45,200
But he's going to want more
specifics on the football.

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Where are we on that?

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Jack's at the debris field outside of indio.

66
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,600
He's trying to reconstruct the red chapter
of the playbook that was stolen by Marwan.

67
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,565
How's he doing that?

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,300
He's working with fred laughton
from the department of defense.

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
He wrote the codes, so
he'll know what's missing.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Good.

71
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,200
Who's going to run point on this update?

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,100
You and Tony.

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,118
All right, everyone, we don't have a lot of

74
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,000
time, so we're going to
have to fast-track this.

75
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,000
Double source all intel through
homeland security and CIA.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,700
Skip the usual request procedures,

77
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,200
tie into their data directly.

78
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:15,665
yes?

79
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Ms. Dessler, I've got
Jack Bauer on the line.

80
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,300
Put him through.

81
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,200
Go ahead, Jack.

82
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Michelle, are you still in briefing?

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,500
Yes, Jack, you're on speaker.

84
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,500
What have you found?

85
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,650
Fred Laughton and I just
finished a rough reconstruction

86
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:29,700
of the red chapter- we're
getting that over to you now.

87
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Jack, it's Bill Buchanan.

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
Summarize our exposure.

89
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,065
What information exactly does
Marwan now have in his possession?

90
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,900
Well, the red chapter lays out the
location of our domestic nuclear arsenal.

91
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,565
The inventory is in the thousands.

92
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
Many of the weapons are in transit as
part of our standard shift operations.

93
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Why can't DOD just secure these weapons?

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Because a number of the weapons
are in between checkpoints.

95
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,700
It would take over an hour
to account for all of them.

96
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Listen, everyone, we've got to
remember, Marwan only needs one.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
All right, Jack, we'll
get on this immediately.

98
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,950
Get back here as soon as you can
and help Audrey liaison with dod.

99
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:03,100
We need to account for every single
weapon documented in that chapter.

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,900
I'm on my way.

101
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,100
The coordinates for the third one
are latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes.

102
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,800
Longitude 115 degrees, 21 minutes.

103
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,100
There it is.

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Jefferson city, Iowa.

105
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
When is the warhead due to arrive?

106
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,700
7:00 A.M., Local time.

107
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,200
Five hours from now.

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,700
That puts it somewhere 200 miles east.

109
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
It's still in illinois.

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,600
We can intercept it anywhere
from this point to here.

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,800
All right.

112
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Let's put our people in place.

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,540
The warheads that are in
transit because of the daily

114
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,600
shift-and-hide operations
pose the biggest problem.

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
We can verify military traffic
in the coastal areas from here.

116
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Why don't we find out what
DOD has in the midwest.

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,765
Yeah, that's already underway.

118
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Audrey said she should
have it in a few minutes.

119
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,900
Look, Tony...

120
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
am I interrupting something?

121
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,950
No, Chloe.

122
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:14,600
What is it?

123
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Are you logged on to division three?

124
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:16,600
Yeah.

125
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,500
Look at this:

126
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,158
15 minutes ago, the
credit card of Eric Murphy

127
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,200
was used at the western
gas station in torrance.

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,300
Who's eric murphy?

129
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,300
His real name is yosik khatami.

130
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
He's a terrorist affiliated with Marwan.

131
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,100
How do we know that?

132
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Through a watch list.

133
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,500
We put out a net asking for anybody
connected to the name Habib Marwan.

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
We didn't expect to get any hits so soon.

135
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Why was he so careless?

136
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,900
Maybe he wasn'T.

137
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,300
Maybe it's some sort of decoy.

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Well, it wouldn't be much
of a decoy because we don't

139
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,100
know where he is or what
direction they're traveling in.

140
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
This was a mistake.

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,100
Did the gas station have
a surveillance camera?

142
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,365
Yes.

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,100
He's driving a black lexus 300.

144
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,800
Are we hooked into satellite?

145
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes, we're monitoring them now.

146
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
If this guy's still on
the road, we'll find him.

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
Who do we have in the area to run point?

148
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,565
Curtis just left division.

149
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
He's heading over here right now.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,250
Divert him to western gas station.

151
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,500
Have field ops meet him there.

152
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,400
All right.

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
This is audrey.

154
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,500
Hey, it's me.

155
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey.

156
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,500
Are you on your way back here?

157
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah.

158
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,400
How much of the weaponry has
been accounted for so far?

159
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:18,265
72 percent.

160
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,900
We're having problems getting
confirmations from the midwest.

161
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,900
Why?

162
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,134
There are several convoys
shipping weapons to be

163
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,500
dismantled in accordance with
the arms reduction treaty.

164
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
A lot of them were re-routed after
the train bombing this morning.

165
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,265
Just use local channels.

166
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,400
All weapon transports have to
check in with regional substations.

167
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,500
Just call them directly.

168
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
All right, I'll do that.

169
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,400
How you holding up?

170
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm okay.

171
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
What have the doctors told you about paul?

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
They're having a hard
time keeping him stable.

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,350
You just hang in there.

174
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:54,200
He'll fight through it.

175
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah.

176
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,900
Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,900
All right, will do.

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,500
Bye.

179
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,200
yes.

180
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Marwan, it's me.

181
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Is everything all right?

182
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,300
No.

183
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,400
No, it's not.

184
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,800
I made a stupid mistake.

185
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,700
They're going to find me.

186
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,100
What happened?

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
I stopped to get gas.

188
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,888
While I was driving away,
I realized I used the

189
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,800
wrong credit card, the one
with the name Eric Murphy,

190
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,400
the one you gave me.

191
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,100
I told you to get rid of that one.

192
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,565
I was in a hurry, Habib.

193
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
I had to make the arrangements
for the delivery of the warhead.

194
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,100
When that transaction gets flagged,
they'll be searching the highways.

195
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:52,700
I know, that's why I'm
not on the highway anymore.

196
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,700
Where are you?

197
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Inglewood.

198
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,900
I'm on my way to Prado's now.

199
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
You're closer to the marina.

200
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,365
Go straight there.

201
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
I'll have him meet you.

202
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Prado can make arrangements
to get you out of the country.

203
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Thank you, Habib.

204
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,300
Thank you.

205
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,600
Mr. President, it may be
precipitous moving to the bunker now.

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,096
Working from the oval office
might exhibit a greater

207
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,600
sense of confidence in our
abilities to handle this crisis.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,600
The purpose of the bunker is to protect
the president in times of crises, is it not?

209
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:29,400
Yes, sir.

210
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,400
now

211
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,200
I feel it's always wiser
to take the prudent course.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Will I be able to function at
100 percent down here, mike?

213
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,400
Absolutely, mr. President.

214
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,100
What kind of protection
does this bunker afford?

215
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Total.

216
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,100
You're 200 feet below the surface.

217
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,300
If the white house suffers a direct hit,

218
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:27,900
everyone in the bunker would be safe,

219
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,600
as would the communication
infrastructure to the rest of the country.

220
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Let's hope that's not needed.

221
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:48,694
Mr. President...

222
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line.

223
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,100
Hello, Bill.

224
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
What do you have for me?

225
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,998
Mr. President, I'm here with
Michelle dessler, director

226
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,000
of CTU Los Angeles and Tony
Almeida, heading up tactical.

227
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,700
Good.

228
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,500
Let's get started.

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,300
Have all of our armaments referenced
in the red chapter been secured?

230
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,765
Not completely, mr. President,

231
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,400
but we're working with DOD on that.

232
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,100
What else do we know?

233
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,300
The man who has choreographed today's
events, Habib Marwan, is still at large.

234
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,800
Most likely he is in
possession of the red chapter.

235
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,100
What are we doing to find him?

236
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
We just picked up a thread, sir.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,100
We have a location where one of Marwan's
associates was detected 20 minutes ago.

238
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,500
That sounds promising.

239
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,900
What else?

240
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,100
We're sifting through all of our intel now.

241
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,000
We're hoping to put together
a pursuit scenario soon.

242
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
So you're pretty confident you'll be able
to catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan,

243
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
before he strikes again?

244
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,600
It's not an exact science, sir.

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,700
All we can do is maximize
the probability for success.

246
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,100
There are no guarantees.

247
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:53,865
Of course.

248
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
I understand that.

249
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,400
We need to get control of the situation.

250
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I can't run the government
from down here indefinitely,

251
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,200
but I'm not going upstairs until it's safe.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Sir...

253
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I think their time is better
spent working up what they have.

254
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,800
I recommend we let them get back to it.

255
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, bill...

256
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
call us when you have
something more concrete.

257
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,700
Yes, sir, I will.

258
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,300
All right, let's get back to it.

259
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,465
Wait a second.

260
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Does anybody else feel uneasy
about what we just heard here?

261
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,800
In what way?

262
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Logan's supposed to the
man who speaks to the

263
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:46,600
people of this country
and exudes confidence.

264
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,200
Not fear.

265
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,100
Air force one was just attacked, president
Keeler is in critical conditional.

266
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Logan was just sworn in, give him time.

267
00:11:58,435 --> 00:11:59,600
We don't have time.

268
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,565
We've got Yosik Khatami.

269
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
A traffic cam picked him up,
heading towards the coast.

270
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:04,265
We have him on satellite.

271
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,900
Link this up to Curtis, I want
him running point on this takedown.

272
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,500
Tell Curtis to remain discreet.

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,800
I want to know what Khatami's doing, who
he's meeting, before we take him down.

274
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,300
Michelle...

275
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,300
I was out of line before,
about you and Bill.

276
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,500
It's your life, and I've
got no right to judge you.

277
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
I appreciate that.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
And whatever tension there is between
us, I want to apologize for my part in it.

279
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,700
I'd like it if we could just let
it go, so we could do our jobs.

280
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,000
Leave the past in the past and move on.

281
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,400
Sounds good.

282
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,100
all right

283
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,565
Curtis just called in.

284
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,165
He's about to arrive at
the marina and set up.

285
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
Good, set up a satellite,
also patch in an audio link.

286
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:26,800
I'll take care of it now.

287
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:27,500
Thanks, Edgar.

288
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,000
You want me to run point on that?

289
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,100
No, bill and I will do that,
but I want you in on this.

290
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,100
To do what?

291
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,200
I'd like your tactical input.

292
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,500
Fine, uh, I'll have Edgar transfer
everything over to the situation room.

293
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,759
I get the feeling Tony's not entirely

294
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,300
comfortable with the
configuration here today.

295
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
We haven't seen each
other for a very long time.

296
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,900
It's uncomfortable for both of us.

297
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,100
The difference is, you seem
to be able to stay on point.

298
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm not so sure about him.

299
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,200
I am

300
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,000
He'll be fine.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,500
He's alone.

302
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,800
What's he doing?

303
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,400
It looks like a meet.

304
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,300
He's waiting for someone.

305
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,000
Is the marine unit in place?

306
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,900
Yeah, behind the jetty.

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Looks like the man Yosik's meeting
just arrived, he's walking towards him.

308
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,300
Is it Marwan?

309
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,300
I can't tell.

310
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,900
All right, copy.

312
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,400
All right, all teams, I'll
close off the foot of the pier.

313
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,100
Keep them contained,
but do not shoot to kill.

314
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,400
Repeat, do not shoot to kill.

315
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Damn it.

316
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Teams respond.

317
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,900
Who is that?

318
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,400
This is macallan at point three.

319
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,700
It looks like a private patrol.

320
00:15:58,735 --> 00:15:59,800
All right, hold your positions.

321
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Yosik..

322
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,300
Brother.

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,600
You're late.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
I've been standing here waiting for you.

325
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,400
Well, I'm here now.

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,700
Let's go.

327
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,300
Come on.

328
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,600
What are you waiting for?

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,300
Wait.

330
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,450
What's the matter?

331
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:18,200
Someone's here.

332
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,700
This is Miller. Blue base is clear.

333
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,800
It's okay.

334
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,950
It's just marina security.

335
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,500
No, something's wrong.

336
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,600
They're onto us.

337
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:33,700
Yosik, now.

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,300
The man he's meeting is not Marwan.

339
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,100
Is there anybody else there
besides the two of them?

340
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,700
Not unless there's someone else on the boat.

341
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
All right, marine units, move into position.

342
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
All teams, move in.

343
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,900
We're okay.

344
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,900
I think we should just get out of here.

345
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
There was a police officer out there.

346
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,900
I told you, that's harbor security.

347
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,200
They stop by all the time.

348
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,665
Damn it.

349
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Who the hell's that?

350
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
This is CTU.

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
We have you completely surrounded.

352
00:17:59,600 --> 00:17:59,965
Yes?

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
They found us!

354
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,600
Where are you?

355
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:01,965
It doesn't matter.

356
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,850
It's over- they're
going to get us.

357
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,700
Yosik, you can't let that happen.

358
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,200
You cannot allow yourself to be captured.

359
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,700
I understand.

360
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
Also, you have to kill Prado.

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,900
He knows too much.

362
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll do what's necessary.

363
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,500
Yosik?

364
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
Yosik?

365
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,300
Come out with your hands up!

366
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,700
You're completely surrounded.

367
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,600
There's no escape.

368
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,200
Drop the gun!

369
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:34,500
Put the gun down!

370
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Step off the boat.

371
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Get off the boat.

372
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,300
There's a man inside.

373
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,850
I shot him- he
was gonna kill me.

374
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:41,900
He was trying to steal my boat.

375
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
It was self-defense.

376
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600
Put your hands on your head.

377
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,400
Who are you?

378
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,000
Who are you?

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,600
My name's Joe prado

380
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
I'm innocent.

381
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,000
I have nothing to hide.

382
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,700
Where's Yosik?

383
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,400
He's dead.

384
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,800
This phone was lying next to him.

385
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,700
Get him out of here.

386
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,300
let's go

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Secure the boat.

388
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,500
Yosik's dead.

389
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,000
We have the man he was meeting.

390
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,200
He says his name is Joe Prado.

391
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Bring him in.

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
We also recovered Yosik's cell phone.

393
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:20,800
We'll try and pull something off it.

394
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:21,700
I'll report to you en route.

395
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:22,617
Good work, Curtis.

396
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:23,500
We're standing by.

397
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,000
What do you want to do?

398
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,500
Control the situation.

399
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,700
Make sure Prado doesn't
talk to the authorities.

400
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,500
He can hurt us.

401
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
How do we get to him?

402
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,400
We can'T.

403
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Not directly.

404
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,765
Hello?

405
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
This is Marwan.

406
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes, Marwan?

407
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,500
Can you reach amnesty global at this hour?

408
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,700
For what?

409
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,300
An attorney.

410
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,165
I'm sure I can.

411
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,117
Tell them that an innocent
man is being held without

412
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:12,200
charges and is about to be
tortured at CTU Los Angeles.

413
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,300
By god's grace, President Keeler
survived, but more than 75 others did not.

414
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,900
I share in your grief and
anger from this tragedy.

415
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,600
My family and I feel no differently
than each and every one of you.

416
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,200
We are shocked, saddened
and maybe a little afraid.

417
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,700
These terrorists have displayed, once
again, their indifference toward human life.

418
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,000
They will pay for what they
have done, I assure you.

419
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,000
Bill, excuse me.

420
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
There's a convoy missing.

421
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,100
What?

422
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,373
It was headed from
Illinois to Jefferson city,

423
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,500
Iowa- it disappeared
just inside the border.

424
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:52,165
Disappeared?

425
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,100
They were due to call in at their
checkpoint every 20 minutes, they didn'T.

426
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,500
I tried to reach them on comsat.

427
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:57,500
There was no reply.

428
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,400
What about satellite?

429
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,300
Nothing showing up.

430
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,600
What was on the trucks?

431
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,200
A nuclear warhead.

432
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,400
Our faith and our resolve will prevail.

433
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
Okay, we've got the fingerprints.

434
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,600
I'll run them through our databases.

435
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:28,200
thanks

436
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
What do we know about the
prisoner Curtis is bringing in?

437
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,400
Just the name he gave: Joe prado.

438
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Curtis just uploaded his picture and prints.

439
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm running them through now.

440
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,900
Prep holding so curtis can begin
interrogation as soon as they arrive.

441
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I want this man broken
in minutes, not hours.

442
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,127
Clear all directories,

443
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,983
put all resources into finding this warhead.

444
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,700
Believe me, Mike, I wish I had
known about this sooner, too.

445
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Look, I'm not pointing fingers here.

446
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:52,988
I'm on your side,

447
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:55,103
but the president is not going to be happy

448
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:57,502
that the statement he
made could be invalidated.

449
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:58,300
I don't know what to tell you.

450
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,200
We're putting everything we've got
into finding this missing warhead.

451
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,500
All right, we'll get back to you.

452
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
Move!

453
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:11,800
Inside!

454
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:12,165
Let's go!

455
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,500
Move, move, move!

456
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
We've got it and we're heading out now.

457
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,600
General Thomas just told me
we're missing a nuclear warhead.

458
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes, I just heard some of the
details from Bill Buchanan.

459
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,900
When did this happen?

460
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,100
It disappeared somewhere between 1:45 A.M.

461
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,465
And 2:15 central time.

462
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,300
None of our satellites
was able to pick this up?

463
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,965
It was in mountain terrain at night.

464
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Our people are analyzing the imagery
now, but it's going to be hard to find.

465
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,965
What are we going to do if
we don't find this man Marwan?

466
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,800
Our people are doing everything they can
to contain him to the Los Angeles area.

467
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,765
It's going to be difficult for him to leave.

468
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,990
Yeah, well, it's difficult
to shoot down air force one

469
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,300
with our own stealth fighters,
but he managed to do that.

470
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,700
Who knows what else they're planning?

471
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,500
I'm sure he's going to come after me next.

472
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Mr. President, there's no
indication that that's his plan.

473
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:27,117
You don't know that!

474
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:27,965
I don't know that!

475
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,200
We don't have enough information
to know what his plan is!

476
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,000
The head of Secret service
is on his way over now.

477
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,900
He has a revised plan that I'm certain
will ease your mind about your safety.

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,700
That's the bastard curtis
found at the marina.

479
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,300
The one that's helping the terrorists.

480
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,100
I guess.

481
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
I'd like to get him in
a room for a few minutes.

482
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,400
What?

483
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,000
He'd talk to me in about ten seconds.

484
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,500
Oh, you want to hurt him to get
revenge for your mother dying.

485
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,300
I can understand that.

486
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,500
Take him to holding.

487
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,000
Did Edgar run the prints I sent?

488
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,800
Yeah. The name checks out.

489
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Joseph prado, ex-marine.

490
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,417
No criminal record, but over the last five

491
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,700
years, he's got no record
of employment, either.

492
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,500
Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary.

493
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,300
That's right.

494
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,900
I'll find out if he knows
anything about the missing warhead.

495
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:33,647
All right.

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,500
Tony

497
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,900
What do you got?

498
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:38,870
I found the convoy

499
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,094
I've just got off the Iowa highway patrol

500
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,775
Millitary transfer was ambushed

501
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:43,759
Everyone's dead

502
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,262
what about the warhead?

503
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:46,269
Gone

504
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,852
Alright,find out what kind of
vechile being used to transport

505
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:52,028
also tell the local
law-enforcement to put up premiters

506
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,923
I want you to check for
any airstrip server remotely

507
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:55,712
clearence they might be
able to put down a chopper

508
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:56,286
Yeah

509
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,538
Remember he's ex-marine

510
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,787
He won't cave easily

511
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,226
I just need to establish that even
we're in the government building

512
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:11,491
I'm gonna go as far as it takes

513
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:14,584
How are you gonna start?

514
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:16,495
i will use Richard

515
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,028
OK

516
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,334
I've told you i'm not talking to you,pal

517
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:37,698
I haven't been doing anything wrong

518
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:41,717
I killed that man,it was a self-defence,he
was trying to steal my boat.

519
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,848
We both know it's a lie

520
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:46,136
So let's not wasting our
time,what do you say,John?

521
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,405
I'm not saying anyting to you.

522
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:49,636
Now,you're lying to me

523
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:06,857
What the hell is this?

524
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:14,001
Yes

525
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,299
Michelle,where's curtis?

526
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,050
He's just about start with pardo

527
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:17,998
Tell him to stop.

528
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:19,451
What?

529
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:21,566
That's an order, both of
you, come to the floor, now.

530
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,418
- It was a
self-defence - Curtis

531
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:25,112
- You can't do this to me
- Curtis

532
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:26,120
What?

533
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:29,063
Bill wants to see us before we start

534
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,081
Wait till I get back

535
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:41,785
What's this about?

536
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:43,579
I don't know

537
00:26:58,507 --> 00:26:59,256
We have a problem with that

538
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,122
This is david winston from amnesty globe

539
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,331
And I have a signed court
order here protecting the

540
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,051
rights of joesff Prado who
knew have been in custody

541
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:11,923
You see US maschalls are here to assure
that i'm taking to the prisoner immediately

542
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:13,668
That's ridiculous

543
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:14,705
That's your opinion

544
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:17,376
But Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated

545
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,699
Take me to him now

546
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:20,581
We are not assured Curtis
Do as he says

547
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:21,944
There is a nuclear warhead missing

548
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:23,275
This is our only lead Bill

549
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:26,402
I'll get into this with the Justice Department.
In the meantime do what he says

550
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,400
When can i expect his call?

551
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,800
It's extremely important

552
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,580
Yes,i understand that
but i need to talk to the

553
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,500
judge immediately please
have him called me back

554
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Mr. Buchanan

555
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,350
Do you have those hourlies for me?

556
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,365
No, i don't

557
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,700
but i'm here on another matter

558
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,900
you what?

559
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,550
I heard the interrogation on
prado have been put on hold

560
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:01,800
that's right

561
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:02,500
why

562
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,100
you have a job to do,please get back to work

563
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
I know i'm not supposed to be
interfering in the matters of policy

564
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,700
but considering what i
have been through today

565
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
my mother dying because of these terrorists

566
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,800
i want to know why you let some slamy
lawyer protect the dirty-bag like prado

567
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,450
we don't happy that
either,but we're gonna fix it

568
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:18,642
but it's gonna take some time

569
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:19,800
that's time we don't have

570
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:20,800
Edgar stop

571
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,200
i'm trying to cut you some slack here

572
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,600
but you need to get back to your job

573
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,500
you need to put all that
stuff aside and hold for awhile

574
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,200
yes,sir

575
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,100
yeah, Cannon

576
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,600
yes

577
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:38,500
i'll hold for the judge

578
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
what was that all about?you're
supposed to be doing the hourlies.

579
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:42,200
I know

580
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
i don't want anybody keeps telling
me what i'm supposed to be doing

581
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
i have a photographic
memory in case you forgot

582
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,800
How can i forgot,you tell me
like every other of the day

583
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
i don't know why what's happened here

584
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,700
we have some pc lawyer holding
us up from doing our job

585
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,117
your job is do the hourlies

586
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,500
you're holding yourself up

587
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,000
chole

588
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,300
Have you heard of the mising warhead.

589
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:14,582
yeah, FBI link up with our department yet?

590
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,150
yes.i'm sharing both of databases

591
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,898
OK. Good. who's questioning the prisoner

592
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,611
You mean Joseph Prado that Curtis broght in

593
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:20,233
yeah

594
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,800
no one

595
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,196
what are you talking about? the
attorney came in from antis globe

596
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:22,700
with a court order saying he won't
allow to being-alone with Prado

597
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,982
The attorney came in from
amnesty globe with a court

598
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:27,300
order saying we won't be
allowed to being-alone with Prado

599
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,700
Buchanan is on the phone with
judge sending the order now

600
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
I'll be right back.

601
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,200
I don't believe this

602
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,300
I disagree with you,you honor, this does
not fall outside the boundary of patriot

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
yeah,alright thanks

604
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,711
what the hell is going on here you got
the key witness on the missing warhead

605
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:45,576
We should be pressing this
guy with everything we've got

606
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:46,392
Judge's known more

607
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,271
If you want to appeal we should wait
until 7 A.M. take him to the pillar judge

608
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:50,289
does he know what the stakes are?

609
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:53,346
he does,but he's feeling Prado got no record
he shouldn't be treated like a terrorist

610
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,421
What about the fact that
he was caught meeting with

611
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:57,312
known terrorist in the
middle of the night on appear?

612
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:58,400
Circumstantial

613
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,553
we need to interrgoate this prisioner, I

614
00:30:00,554 --> 00:30:02,700
don't care what kind of
court order we even get

615
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,517
I agree but the attorney is with him

616
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,300
U.S. Marshal's protecing his right.

617
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
Where's attorney?

618
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:08,700
In holding with Prado

619
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,650
Jack, don't make it worse.

620
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,000
I just want to talk to him.

621
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,900
How much longer do I have to stay here?

622
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,565
I'm trying to get you out as soon as I can.

623
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,800
My office is in the process
of filing a complaint.

624
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
They have nothing on me.

625
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,900
I was standing alone on my boat.

626
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,896
I don't even know the man'd going after.

627
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,000
Come in with me, Al.

628
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,965
Who are you?

629
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,500
My name is Jack Bauer, Department
of Defense, and you are?

630
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,700
David Weiss, amnesty global.

631
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Curtis, why is the suspect
not in his restraints?

632
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,700
Amnesty global's order
supersedes our authority.

633
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:48,900
Mr. Bauer, my client is cooperating.

634
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,065
He's not trying to go anywhere.

635
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,565
All he wants is to be treated
like any other U.S. Citizen.

636
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,296
Your client aided and abetted people who

637
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:56,500
attacked the president of
the united states today.

638
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
You don't know that.

639
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,900
As a matter of fact, we do.

640
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,700
Then charge him.

641
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,900
May I speak with you privately?

642
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,600
Get the door.

643
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,399
You and I both know that
your client isn't clean and

644
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,900
that he conspired to steal
a U.S. Nuclear warhead.

645
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:27,500
All my client wants is due process.

646
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Mr. Weiss

647
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,100
these people are not gonna
stop attacking us today

648
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,900
until millions and millions
of americans are dead.

649
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,022
Now, I don't want to
bypass the constitution,

650
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,100
but these are extraordinary circumstances.

651
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,600
The constitution was born out of
extraordinary circumstances, Mr. Bauer.

652
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,900
This plays out by the book, not
in a backroom with a rubber hose.

653
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,300
I hope you can live with that.

654
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,500
Sir, can I help you?

655
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,500
No, it's all right.

656
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,900
How did you get here so fast?

657
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,200
What?!

658
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,900
Who asked you to represent Mr. Prado?

659
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,165
I don't have to give you that information.

660
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,600
Curtis, from the time of his arrest, did
the suspect have time to call a lawyer?

661
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:44,200
No.

662
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
Marwan called amnesty global.

663
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:54,100
This is his play.

664
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
That means prado definitely knows
something Marwan doesn't want us to hear.

665
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,900
We still can't get around that court order.

666
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
We need to call the president now.

667
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,000
We cannot have any leaks
regarding this missing warhead.

668
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,800
I've contacted General Wilson in Iowa.

669
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,100
He's sealing off the roads while
we clean up the ambushed convoy.

670
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,200
What about those highway patrol
officers who discovered it?

671
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,900
Wilson's already brought them in
and is explaining the situation.

672
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,100
The good news is, this is happening
in the middle of the night.

673
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,300
Most of the country's still asleep.

674
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,200
yes.

675
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,700
CTU Los Angeles is on the
line for president Logan.

676
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,000
They say it's urgent.

677
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,700
Thank you, gentlemen.

678
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:39,600
That'll be all.

679
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Walt.

680
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,700
Stay.

681
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,100
Put 'em through.

682
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,400
Go ahead, please.

683
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Mr. President, this is Bill Buchanan.

684
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm here with Jack Bauer.

685
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,365
Yes, bill.

686
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,165
What do you have for me?

687
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,470
Sir, in the process of trying
to track down this missing

688
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:08,700
warhead, we brought a prime
suspect in for questioning.

689
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,000
What have you learned?

690
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,400
Well, that's the problem, sir.

691
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:12,600
Right now, our hands are tied.

692
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,600
Amnesty global has interceded on his behalf.

693
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
Interceded on what grounds?

694
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,100
He's a U.S. Citizen with no previous record.

695
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,900
Why is he a suspect?

696
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,700
We found him with Yosik Khatami, the man
who's linked to today's terrorist events.

697
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,665
I don't understand.

698
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,100
It doesn't violate any
law to question a suspect.

699
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Mr. President, if I may...?

700
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
Go ahead, Mike.

701
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,700
Jack, it's Mike Novick.

702
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,500
Hi, Mike.

703
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,800
Am I correct in assuming
that this suspect is unlikely

704
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:44,900
to respond to the kind of
q&a his lawyer would permit?

705
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:45,765
That's correct, mike.

706
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,508
If we want to procure
any information from this

707
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:49,500
suspect, we're gonna have
to do it behind closed doors.

708
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,265
You're talking about torturing this man?

709
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,089
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to

710
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,000
stop this warhead from
being used against us.

711
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,900
Give us a moment, Bill.

712
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,500
Mike, what do you think?

713
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,100
I think we need to do whatever
it takes to find Marwan.

714
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,000
Walt?

715
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,000
Weigh in.

716
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,300
Well, this makes me nervous.

717
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,700
Why?

718
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,000
Should this man be
innocent, as he claims he is,

719
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,900
your first act as president
is to sanction his torture.

720
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,900
Well, that'll...

721
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,700
that'll forever haunt your presidency.

722
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,700
All right, gentlemen.

723
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,900
Here's what I'll agree to.

724
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,932
I'll call a special session with members of

725
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:53,200
the justice department
and we'll discuss this.

726
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,665
I'll have an answer for you in 20 minutes.

727
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,600
Mr. President, this thing
could be over in 20 minutes.

728
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,400
That's as far as I'm
willing to go right now.

729
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,200
With all due respect, sir,

730
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,700
please let us do our jobs.

731
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

732
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,400
I'll have curtis start
the interrogation of prado.

733
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,300
You and I both know we can't
afford to be wasting time like this.

734
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,865
You heard the president.

735
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,200
He's not going to let us touch this guy.

736
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
The president's
not here- you are.

737
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,800
If I authorize this,
they'll know in ten minutes.

738
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:40,800
We'll all be out the door.

739
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,584
What if I can find
another way to handle this

740
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:44,100
that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me?

741
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,700
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack.

742
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:46,800
You don't have to.

743
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,300
What do you mean?

744
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,000
Accept my resignation.

745
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
And if I do that, what then?

746
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,300
Release the suspect.

747
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,665
Release him?

748
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,800
We don't question him, don't
charge him, we just let him go.

749
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,300
He won't need a lawyer, or a marshal.

750
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
You're going to take him
on as a private citizen.

751
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,900
yes?

752
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,200
how far away are you?

753
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,500
92 miles.

754
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,600
When you get there, you'll meet with Morris.

755
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,300
Is he the one who's going
to configure the detonation?

756
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes.

757
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,100
I've given him the codes.

758
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,600
Okay.

759
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir.

760
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,900
We cannot give the americans
time to start an evacuation.

761
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,600
Yes, Marwan. I understand.

762
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,100
No delays.

763
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,300
It'd be done.

764
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,300
Hey, when did you get back?

765
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:12,200
A few minutes ago.

766
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:12,700
Thanks.

767
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,465
Good.

768
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,200
I could use your help on the DOD interface.

769
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,000
I can't help you right now, Audrey. Sorry.

770
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,200
What are you doing?

771
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,600
I'll tell you when I get back.

772
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,300
Jack...

773
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:22,965
Jack!

774
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,900
Audrey, please.

775
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
What the hell are you trying to pull here?

776
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,800
First you want to torture me,
and now you're throwing me out?

777
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,800
That's right.

778
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,665
It's okay, Joe.

779
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,500
I'm sure they tried to fight the restraining
order, then realized they couldn'T.

780
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,200
No, that's not what this is.

781
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,300
They're doing something.

782
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,100
Don't be so paranoid.

783
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,600
We're just not interested in you anymore.

784
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,365
I want protection when I get out of here.

785
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,307
The marshal can escort back
wherever you want to go.

786
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:49,880
No, no, no!

787
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,900
You know what?

788
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:51,700
Change of plan!

789
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,500
I don't want to leave here until I
know I'm safe for the next few days.

790
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
If you don't leave,

791
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,895
I'm going to have to arrest you for

792
00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,500
trespassing in a secured
government building.

793
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,200
Once that happens, not even
your attorney can protect you.

794
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,900
Correct me if I'm wrong, David.

795
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,400
He's right.

796
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,300
What's going on?

797
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Where are they taking Prado?

798
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,300
He's been released.

799
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:30,700
Why?

800
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,465
I don't know.

801
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,600
It came from Buchanan.

802
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Mr. Buchanan, why are you letting him go?

803
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,865
Edgar, not now, please.

804
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,500
But he's working with the
people that killed my mother.

805
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:38,200
Not now.

806
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,300
Cheer up, Joe, you're a free man.

807
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,600
Yeah, free.

808
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,300
The marshal's going to take you home.

809
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:50,665
No.

810
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,000
You kidding me? I can't go home.

811
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,000
I've got to go somewhere
public, like a hotel.

812
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,665
Fine.

813
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,600
Tell him where you want to go.

814
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,600
Don't let anyone know you're there.

815
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,900
Here's my card.

816
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,600
You call me if anyone from
CTU tries to bother you.

817
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,500
Yeah, okay.

818
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,600
You're going to be fine.

819
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,600
make a sound, and I will blow your
brains out, all over the windshield.

820
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,500
Handcuff your left arm
to the dashboard, now.

821
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
now we're going to talk.

822
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,900
now...

823
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,900
you and I both know
your heart isn't in this.

824
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:14,000
You just wanted the money.

825
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I don't want you.

826
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
All I want is Marwan.

827
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:18,765
I don't know any Marwan.

828
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

829
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,700
Yeah, well, I'm running out of time here,
so why don't we just cut to the chase.

830
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
where's Marwan?

831
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:32,600
I don't know!

832
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,400
Where is Marwan?!

833
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,698
Where is Marwan?!

834
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,900
I don't know!

835
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,300
I swear I don't!

836
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,165
Okay, okay, okay, Marwan'S...

837
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,700
Marwan's going to be at a place
called the hub club tonight.

838
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,700
Where is it?

839
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,000
It's just...

840
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:05,922
it's just east...

841
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:06,509
where is it?!

842
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:08,100
It's just east of downtown!

843
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Just east of downtown.

844
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,100
this'll help you with the pain

845
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:21,476
