1

The Americans have been
able to shut down

2
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:16,786
most of the reactors.

3
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:19,052
I'm going to have to manage
the override personally,

4
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,352
<i>make sure those six
meltdown on schedule.</i>

5
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:23,052
Is there anything I can do?

6
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:24,786
Take care of your mess.

7
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,185
I give you my word,

8
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:28,285
my wife and son will be dead
by the end of this day.

9
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:30,252
I'm not afraid of Father.

10
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,619
You should be.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,982
He tried to kill me
and then he did this to you.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,553
You're going to need to set
things up on your end.

13
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,357
All right, what do I do?

14
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,686
<i>Divert suspicion.</i>

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,219
Someone inside CTU
is leaking information

16
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:47,486
to someone
on the outside.

17
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:49,853
<i>Ms. Driscoll, what's going on?</i>

18
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,486
You're under arrest, Gavin.

19
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,018
For what?

20
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:54,452
Passing classified information.

21
00:00:57,786 --> 00:00:59,985
Thousands of people's lives
are at stake.

22
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:02,586
Where are the people
who control the override?

23
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,953
I swear, I don't know anything.

24
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,052
Yeah?

25
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,985
DRISCOLL:
We've got a match, Jack.

26
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,652
<i>His name is Henry Powell.</i>

27
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,285
<i>He's a computer consultant,</i>

28
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:13,652
<i>that used to work
for McLennen-Forster.</i>

29
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,819
They're the defense contractors

30
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:16,052
that designed
the override devices

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,252
controlling the power plants.

32
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,619
You're going to fly
me out of here.

33
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,352
Drop the weapon now!
Now!

34
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,786
Put him in the back.

35
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,819
<i>( gunshot )</i>

36
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:35,853
He's dead, Jack.

Damn it!

38
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,686
You've got the wrong person.

39
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:41,486
Sarah's not guilty of anything.

40
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:43,886
<i>It's Maryanne Taylor.</i>

Excuse me, Curtis.

46
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:12,886
Not now.

47
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:20,853
Coordinate that with NRC
and copy me on 6-0-B. Bye.

48
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,252
I warned you about her.

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,953
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:24,919
Maryanne Taylor.

51
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:26,252
I told you she was trouble

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,419
and it was a mistake to
let her work here. No.

53
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:31,152
You told me that you weren't
comfortable working with her.

54
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,486
You didn't tell me

55
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,219
you were having a relationship
with a corporate spy.

56
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:35,853
How could I have possibly
known that, Erin?

57
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,018
Don't play that card with me.

58
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,486
Fine, then don't walk in here

59
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:40,052
with an I-told-you-so attitude.

60
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,285
Because now we both have

61
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,385
to deal with this.

62
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,619
You mean division?
That's right.

63
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,018
They're going to want
a complete timeline.

64
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,752
Everything from how Maryanne
got through the front door,

65
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,252
down to
the high-security files

66
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,619
that she was able to access

67
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:57,319
in a very short
period of time.

68
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,953
Can we have a conversation
off book?

69
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,719
Go ahead.

70
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:05,819
There's no point in either of us
compromising our authority

71
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,118
in the eyes of division.

72
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:08,152
Agree or disagree?

73
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,219
Agreed.

74
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,953
Maryanne did an excellent job

75
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,919
in establishing her credentials.

76
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,886
All we need to do
is leave out some of the details

77
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:16,985
in how she managed

78
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,652
to leverage
her way in here.

79
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,452
I don't like anyone
holding something over me.

80
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,886
Neither do I.

81
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,452
How long will it take you

82
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,919
to adjust the files?

83
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,419
Two minutes.

84
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:43,586
I'll call division at 5:00.

85
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:56,118
Explain to me how this mole-
Maryanne Taylor-

86
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,319
was able to infiltrate CTU.

87
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,185
We're still investigating,
Mr. President.

88
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,085
Who does she work for?
We don't know.

89
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:03,452
Find out.

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,185
We will, as soon as she
regains consciousness.

91
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:07,552
She's being treated
here in the clinic.

92
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:08,619
Treated for what?

93
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,052
An attempt on her life.

94
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,853
Who tried to kill her?

95
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,886
We don't know that either.

96
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,419
But whoever it was,

97
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,953
they're more than likely
connected

98
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,385
with the theft
of the override.

99
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,519
Jim, we need to find
that override now.

100
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,285
What's the latest
from the NRC?

101
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:25,085
They just reported
the San Gabriel Island reactor

102
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,486
is about to go critical.

103
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:27,786
What's the timeframe?

104
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:30,452
A meltdown within the hour.

105
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,819
We started evacuating
the San Gabriel zone.

106
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:34,118
The population affected

107
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:35,419
is less than 100,000.

108
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,819
Hopefully most of them
are already on the move.

109
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,285
All right.

110
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:42,152
Expedite the process
as much as you can.

111
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,985
Yes, sir.

112

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,385
Erin, Powell's dead.

115
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,619
He was hit by a sniper as soon
as we took him into custody.

116
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,519
Get anything from him
before he was killed?

117
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,853
No, but I managed
to get the last ten calls

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,352
he made off his cell phone.

119
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,152
He called two numbers
repeatedly.

120
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,452
Through caller ID,

121
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,919
we traced one of them
to Maryanne Taylor.

122
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:05,352
Powell was working
with Maryanne?

123
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:06,419
Apparently.

124

What about
this other number?

125
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,519
Hold on.

Can you trace the location?

135
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:35,252
I need to ping the number.
How?

136
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,085
It needs to ring
at least four times

the coordinates.

Well, Dina's not here.

No, I'm not. Navi, no.

Don't tell my husband.
I beg of you.

184
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,319
A hotel in Chatsworth.

185

Download the coordinates
to Jack's PDA.

We're sending it to you now.

Hold on a second.

193
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:36,219
Okay, I got it.

194
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:37,652
We're less than ten minutes out.

195
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,819
I'll have a tactical team

in place
by the time you get there.

197

Thank you.

198
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,185
The body is over there
by my car.

199
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:44,486
He was taken out by a sniper

200
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,519
from the north roof.

201
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:46,953
I want you to take
your photographs

202
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,085
and get the body back
to CTU as fast as possible.

203
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,953
Come on, Tony, we've got to go.

204
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,652
Wait, Jack.

205
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:56,652
Look, uh, I think
I'm done here today.

206
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,985
What are you talking about?

207
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,519
CTU backup's here.
You don't need me anymore.

208
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,819
I need you to see
this through with me.

209
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:04,452
I appreciate
the sentiment, Jack,

210
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,385
but you don't have
to prop up my ego.

211
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:07,552
Tony, this isn't about you.

212
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:08,752
If we don't find

213
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,319
the override device
within an hour,

214
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:12,853
we're going to have six
major nuclear disasters.

215
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,786
So please, get in
the car. Let's go.

216
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,752
Mom, we've got
to get you some help.

217
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,886
I'm okay.

218
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:50,586
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:52,619
This is my fault.

220
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:57,319
Your father shot me, not you.

221
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:02,853
Because you were trying
to stop him from killing me.

222
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,219
Everything that's
happening today,

223
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:10,018
what we've all been
fighting to achieve,

224
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:13,953
it's more important to him
than anything

225
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,486
or anyone.

226
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,686
But not to you.

227
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,886
M om?

228
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,152
I need to get you
something for the pain.

229
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,752
I'll be fine.

230
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,219
I just need to rest.

231
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:41,552
I can get it from Nasim.

232
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:42,752
No.

233
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:44,786
The hospital he works at
is right near here.

234
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,819
I'll be right back.

235
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,052
Nasim doesn't know why

236
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:48,652
we were really living here.

237
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,586
Mom, he's your brother.

238
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:53,185
I'll tell him you need it
and nothing else.

239
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,586
I promise.
I'll be right back.

240
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,819
Just hurry.

241
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,586
I will.

242
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,619
Mr. Secretary,

243
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,252
we have a meltdown.

244
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,319
The San Gabriel Island
reactor has just gone critical.

245
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,819
The core material
is now airborne.

246
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,619
I thought we had more time.

247
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:22,619
Ms. Driscoll, I have Derrick
Ross with the engineer

248
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,652
at San Gabriel Island
on with the NRC.

249
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,919
One of their generators
exploded,

250
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,652
it cooked their com lines,
so the feed is unstable.

251
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,953
We may only have a few seconds.

252
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,018
Patch us in.

253
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:32,552
What's going on?
We've had a meltdown

254
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:33,586
on San Gabriel Island.

255
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,018
<i>( garbled transmission )</i>

256
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:38,752
All attempts to contain
the core have failed.

257
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,185
Right now my men are trying
to bypass the reactor trip,

258
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,552
but that's not working either.

259
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,819
Mr. Rosner,

260
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,319
this is Erin Driscoll from CTU.
Can you hear me?

261
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:47,853
Yes, ma'am, I can.

262
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,752
I'm here with Secretary
of Defense James Heller.

263
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,419
What are your radiation levels?

264
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:57,219
We're at 500 rem right now.

265
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,319
That's 10,000 times
the dose of an X ray.

266
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,385
At this rem rate,
the radiation will continue

267
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,853
getting stronger and will spill
into the atmosphere

268
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,085
until the core
has exhausted itself.

269
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:08,352
Son, you've done
everything you can,

270
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,486
now get the hell
out of there.

271
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,118
Evacuating won't make
any difference, sir.

272
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:15,385
We've already been exposed.

273
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:17,319
We lost them.

274
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,178
Have we analyzed

275
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,746
the radiation
cloud's movement?

276
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,112
We're still waiting
for NGS

277
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:37,878
to get a weather
satellite for us.

278
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,579
Get on the phone
and have them expedite it.

279
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:40,911
I will, as soon

280
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,746
as I'm done rerouting these
evacuation instructions.

281
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:43,945
Can't someone
else do that?

282
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,312
No, sir, I'm short of manpower.

283
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:51,679
A government spokesman
has just confirmed

284
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:54,178
that the nuclear reactor
at San Gabriel Island

285
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,911
is in full meltdown.

286
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,878
Emergency personnel are on site

287
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,178
attempting to rescue workers
exposed to radiation.

288
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,911

You're not listening to me.

I've been trying
to get through to a number

291
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:08,445
in the San Gabriel
evacuation zone for ten minutes.

292
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,545
I need you to link me in to
access the emergency bandwidth,

293
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:12,145
and I need you to do it now.

294
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:13,245
All right, standby.

295
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,312
Thank you.

Yes, I'm watching

Then why haven't
you evacuated by now?

Well, I've tried

Can't you get a ride
from one of them?

313
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,712
No. By the time I got outside
they were all gone.

I'm going to get someone there

I want you to sit by the phone

318

Can you do that?

319
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,545
Yes, I don't really have
a choice.

320

Okay, honey. Bye.

No, we delegated
that whole situation

00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:21,212
Set up the conference call
in ten minutes.

329
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,679
Thank you all.

330
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:30,345
Are you okay?

331
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,878
Yeah. How are you
holding up?

332
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:36,545
Considering the situation
we're in...

333
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:37,646
I'm doing fine.

334
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:41,345
The truth of the matter is,

335
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:44,145
we do not have the manpower
to handle this mess.

336
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:46,978
Tell me what I can do.

337
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:48,646
I've prioritized
evacuation protocol,

338
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,746
but I need someone
to keep the State Police

339
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:53,811
and the National Guard from
bumping in to each other.

340
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:56,379
All right.

341
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,712
I'll stop the Guard

342
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:58,878
at the 75th mile marker

343
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,878
and let the police
take over from there.

344
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,878
That'll maximize room
for civilian traffic.

345
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,178
I wish we had
some other way

346
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:05,811
to get those people
out of there.

347
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,045
There's nowhere else
to route them.

348
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,145
Jack has got to find
the override

349
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:17,045
before the rest of these
reactors go critical.

350
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,545
Hey, Jack.

351
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:33,545
Good to have you
in the field again.

352
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:34,911
Thanks, Lee.
You remember Tony Almeida?

353
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:36,078
Yeah.

354
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,612
I don't know
what he's doing here, though.

355
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,045
I want him here.

356
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,212
LEE: He's not authorized
to be in the field.

357
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,811
I'm going through
that door first.

358
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:43,878
I want him there

359
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:45,545
to back me up.

360
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,245
Fine.

361
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:48,412
Get another vest.

362
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,145
You got a visual on the suspect?

363
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:52,811
We've got a fiber optic
camera inside the room.

364
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,379
According to the manager,

365
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:57,445
we're grabbing a mid-40s
female and a teenage male.

366
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:00,012
Possibly mother and son,
both Middle-Eastern.

367
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,379
Okay, we need
the suspects alive.

368
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:02,612
They're no good to us dead.

369
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,878
I've been briefed.

370
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,112
Let's go.

371
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,878
Agent Castle, we've got
a visual on the woman.

372
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,078
What about the kid?

373
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,911
I haven't seen him yet.

374
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,012
We got to go, now.

375
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,178
You ready?

376
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:39,145
Go.

377
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:43,379
Don't move!

378
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:44,845
Drop the weapon!

379
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:45,845
<i>( gunshot )</i>

380
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:50,178
Where is the override?

381
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:51,479
Tell me who's got it!

382
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:52,512
Tell me!

383
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,878
<i>( screams )
Now!</i>

384
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:57,945
Agent Castle!

385
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,345
Agent Castle, stand down!

386
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,012
Agent Castle,
please stand down!

387
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,845
Get off her!

388
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,178
We've got to get
her to talk.

389
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:06,612
She's going to go
into shock

390
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,212
before she does.
Just relax!

391
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,845
Agent Castle, step outside now!

392
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:13,045
I want her prints
and photographs.

393
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,746
Send them over
to CTU immediately.

394
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:19,445
He has no right
to give me orders.

395
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:21,778
Hey, come here.

396
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:23,545
He did the right thing.

397
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:25,811
That woman was willing
to kill herself.

398
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,379
She'd die before she gave us
anything through force.

399
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,679
We need to get her
to talk

400
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,679
before the other
reactors go critical.

401
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:31,911
And we will.

402
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:34,646
What did you have in mind?

403
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:35,911
We need to find
some leverage.

404
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:38,045
<i>( phone rings )</i>

405
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,178
CTU, Barnes.

406
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,279
Yeah, it's Jack.
Put me through to Erin.

407
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:44,012
Come here. Come here.

408
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:47,245
Let me see your arm.

409
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,078
Driscoll.

410
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,245
Erin, we've got a suspect.

411
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,945
I'm sending you fingerprints
and photographs.

412
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:53,078
I need you
to run a profile

413
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,545
and send me all
relevant databases

414
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:56,012
and electronic
communications.

415
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,178
Got it.

416
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:58,445
Thank you.

417
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:02,579
Hey, I understand
your concerns about Almeida,

418
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:06,712
but for me, please,
just give him a break.

419
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,212
Okay, Jack.

420
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,245
TONY:
Jack!

421
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:10,612
Thanks.

422
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,679
JACK:
Yeah?

423
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:13,778
This is a bullet wound.

424
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:16,512
Probably a couple
hours old.

425
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:25,112
As the evacuation appears now
to be in full swing

426
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,778
with major delays
on all routes...

427
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,178
Excuse me.

428
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:31,212
A nuclear emergency team

429
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,646
has just emerged from the plant.

430
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,379
Uh, we can see them here
on our Sky-Cam.

431
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:40,646
They seem to be going through
some kind of decontamination...

432
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:43,545
<i>( new report continues
in background )</i>

433
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,712
Behrooz.

434
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,378
Uncle Nasim.

435
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:52,679
Are you all right?

436
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:53,946
Yeah, I think so.

437
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,478
Yeah, it's a disaster
what's happening today.

438
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,412
Everyone's panicked
about radiation poisoning.

439
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:59,612
They all want iodine pills
and we're almost out.

440
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,745
Is that why you're here?

441
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:02,745
No.

442
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:03,845
I need pain medication.

443
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,946
It's for my mother.

444
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,445
She couldn't reach
her doctor by phone,

445
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:08,912
so she wanted me
to get it from you.

446
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,478
What's wrong with her?

447
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:11,812
It's her back.
She can barely walk.

448
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,445
She needs a prescription.

449
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:14,445
I told you.

450
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:16,812
She couldn't reach her doctor.

451
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:19,779
I'll see what I can do, okay?

452
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:21,046
Just have a seat.

453
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,046
<i>( phone rings )</i>

454
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:45,946
Yes?

455
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:46,979
Navi, it's Nasim.

456
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,845
Hello, Nasim, how are you?

457
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:51,579
I'm well, but Behrooz just
showed up at the hospital.

458
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,745
He seems disturbed.

459
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:54,946
Is Dina there too?

460
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:56,545
No, he says he needs
pain medication for her.

461
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,145
That there's something
wrong with her back,

462
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:00,312
but he's acting
very strange.

463
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:02,712
I'm sorry you have to be
involved in this, Nasim.

464
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,612
Involved in what?
What's going on?

465
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,345
Behrooz may be taking drugs.

466
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,345
He's been getting worse.

467
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,512
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:10,512
Me, too.

469
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,745
What do you want
me to do?

470
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,412
Keep Behrooz there
until I can come for him.

471
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:16,512
How long will you be?

472
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,912
15 minutes.

473
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,312
I'll do my best, but...

474
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,613
Please, Nasim, don't let him
leave until I get there.

475
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:47,560
...congestion, the government
is asking people to remain calm

476
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:49,627
and exit in a quick
and safe manner.

477
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,894
Excuse me, Miss Raines.

478
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,093
I'm Edgar Stiles.
Sorry.

479
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,593
We've got a major
noncompliance problem.

480
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,560
I've got 25%
of the evacuees who aren't going

481
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:57,960
where they're being told to go,

482
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:59,627
and another 25%
that don't even know

483
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,226
that they're
in the evac zone.

484
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,493
However you need to do it,
make sure it gets done.

485
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,260
I'm sorry, what is it?

486
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:10,927
It's my mother.
Your mother?

487
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:12,326
She lives near
San Gabriel Island.

488
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:14,026
She's in a wheelchair.
She doesn't drive.

489
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:15,460
She missed her call to evacuate.

490
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:16,827
Now I don't know what to do.

491
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:18,293
Maybe someone from
the National Guard can get her.

492
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,026
I already spoke to
the area commander.

493
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:21,527
He said he couldn't
spare anyone.

494
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:24,026
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
what I can do.

495
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,293
Here's his number.

496
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,793
I thought maybe if you
called him yourself.

497
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,293
Look, I hate asking
for special treatment.

498
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,059
That's not something
I would normally do,

499
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,660
but she's my mother.

500
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,693
I can't make any promises.

501
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,627
Just promise me
you'll try, okay?

502
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,827
All right.

503
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,260
I want you to give
her something

504
00:21:58,326 --> 00:21:59,793
for the pain,
but make sure

505
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,426
she stays lucid.
Understand?

506
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:13,660
Did you find out
who she is yet?

507
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:14,827
Yeah.

508
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:17,026
Her name is Dina Araz.
She immigrated

509
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:19,326
to the United States
five years ago,

510
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:20,560
became a citizen
two years ago.

511
00:22:20,627 --> 00:22:21,560
Married to a Navi Araz.

512
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:22,960
He's also
a naturalized citizen.

513
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:25,159
Owns an electronics
store in Carson.

514
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:27,426
They have one son,
Behrooz, 17, a junior

515
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:28,560
at the local high school.

516
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,193
None of them
have criminal records.

517
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,593
They pop up on
any watch lists?

518
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,927
No, they must have
slipped under the radar.

519
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:34,159
Let's send some teams
over to the house

520
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:35,326
and the store, see
what we can find.

521
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:36,326
<i>( phone rings )</i>

522
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:37,326
Yeah?

523
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:38,727
Jack, it's Driscoll.

524
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:39,927
Homeland Security has...

525
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:42,793
Hold on, Erin.
I can barely hear you.

526
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,226
Go ahead.

527
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:46,426
After the attack this
morning, Homeland Security

528
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:49,126
has been archiving select
communications in the L.A. area.

529
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,793
They pulled up a call
that may explain

530
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,293
how Dina Araz got shot.

531
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,727
Erin, I'm going to put you on
speaker phone. Hold on a second.

532
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,360
You're on.

533
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,927
This conversation happened
about two hours ago

534
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:01,593
between the mother
and the son.

535
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,360
BEHROOZ: He wants me dead
because I messed up with Debbie.

536
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,760
DINA:
Behrooz, that's not possible.

537
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:08,727
Your father would
never want to hurt you.

538
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:09,894
BEHROOZ:
It's true.

539
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,727
Tariq told me everything.

540
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:14,059
DINA:
He was lying.

541
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,593
BEHROOZ:
No, he wasn't.

542
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,059
Mom, I don't know what to do.

543
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:20,226
You have to help me.

544
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,460
DINA:
Where are you now?

545
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,593
BEHROOZ: I'm near the Metrolink
station on Lassen in Chatsworth.

546
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,059
DINA:
Are you using Tariq's car?

547
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:28,226
BEHROOZ:
Yes.

548
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:29,460
DINA:
Hide it.

549
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,293
I'll pick you up there
in a half hour.

550
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,927
BEHROOZ:
Hurry.

551
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,593
That's it.

552
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,827
Let me know the minute
you get something from her.

553
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,293
Yeah.

554
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,693
We got our leverage.

555
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:45,793
<i>( door opens )</i>

556
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,727
JACK:
Lee.

557
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:06,059
<i>( water running )</i>

558
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:35,693
How long have you been
planning this operation?

559
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,894
Two years?

560
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,460
Five years?

561
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,260
Ten?

562
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:45,426
All this planning

563
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:46,827
for one day.

564
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:54,660
You do realize if all
the reactors melt down,

565
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,393
hundreds of thousands
of people will die.

566
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,226
Every war has casualties.

567
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,026
These people don't
know about your war.

568
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,059
These people
are innocent.

569
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,026
No one is innocent.

570
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:07,760
You really believe that?

571
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:10,059
As strongly as you believe

572
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:12,727
in what you believe.

573
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:14,493
But I won't waste

574
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,360
your time or mine,
trying to explain something

575
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,026
you can never understand.

576
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:25,393
Maybe I understand
more than you think.

577
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,827
I doubt it.

578
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,927
I know that something
happened today

579
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:32,026
to challenge
your commitment to your war.

580
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:36,527
You weren't willing to let
your son become a casualty.

581
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:38,760
That's why you were shot.

582
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:41,426
Protecting him
from his father.

583
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,760
I understand that.

584
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:55,727
I know what it's like

585
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:58,727
to watch your child
be threatened

586
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,059
and feel helpless

587
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:03,126
to do anything about it.

588
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,693
Right now Behrooz is
out there alone...

589
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,727
and you and I know he's
not gonna last very long.

590
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:12,894
His father

591
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,093
will find him...

592
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,827
...and kill him.

593
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,860
There is
another option.

594
00:26:30,894 --> 00:26:35,793
If you were to help us find
the override device...

595
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,093
we will protect your son.

596
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,560
So he can spend the rest
of his life in prison?

597
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:42,927
No, so he can

598
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,293
walk away from all of this,

599
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,293
immune from prosecution.

600
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,994
How?

601
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,760
Mrs. Araz, your son is a minor.

602
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:51,093
He's 17 years old.

603
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,426
I can get him a legal
and binding pardon

604
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:56,159
signed by the president
of the United States.

605
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,960
You don't have the
authority to do this.

606
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:01,593
I can reach the president.

607
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:04,527
If you provide us

608
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,293
with the information
that allows us

609
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
to find the override
device- in time-

610
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,927
<i>I am confident
that the president</i>

611
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:12,860
<i>will sign that pardon.</i>

612
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:15,894
and this offer
expires the second

613
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,393
another reactor melts down.

614
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,793
Do you understand me?

615
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:23,059
You don't have a lot of time.

616
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:24,894
I would think about this.

617
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,994
Show me this document.

618
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:34,326
And I'll help you
find what you want.

619
00:27:50,574 --> 00:27:52,474
Can we rule out
this boy's involvement

620
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,875
with the terrorist action?

621
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,075
No, sir. It's likely he knew
of his parents' plans.

622
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,608
He probably helped them.

623
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,908
Jack, you're asking me to
grant clemency to a terrorist.

624
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,142
Mr. President, I'm sorry,

625
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,808
but I don't think
we have a choice.

626
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,341
In all of my professional
experience, I believe that

627
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:07,174
we have to give in
to this woman's demands.

628
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,207
Have you tried

629
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:09,207
negotiating with her?

630
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:10,641
We don't have time.

631
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,541
In approximately two hours,
five nuclear reactors

632
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,574
are gonna go critical unless
we find the override device.

633
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,042
She is our only link.

634
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:20,741
Well, I'm uncomfortable with
this, but I trust your judgment.

635
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,574
I'll release the letter.

636
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:26,474
Thank you, Mr. President.

637
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,841
Make sure that document
is non-binding.

638
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:35,941
Yes, I understand.

639
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:39,274
I'll get back to you
on the redeployment figures.

640
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:40,608
Miss Raines?

641
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:41,708
Did you talk to them?

642
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:44,241
Yes.

643
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,441
Edgar, I'm sorry.
They can't get your mother.

644
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:48,775
Why not? They're
five miles off the highway.

645
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:49,941
It wouldn't take
that much time.

646
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,274
They know where she is.

647
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:52,708
Then what's the problem?
Thousands of people

648
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:54,075
are stuck
on the Interstate in traffic.

649
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,341
It's taking the combined efforts

650
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:56,741
<i>of the police and
the National Guard</i>

651
00:28:56,808 --> 00:28:57,741
to get them moving.

652
00:28:57,808 --> 00:28:59,142
So who cares
about one old woman.

653
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,174
They've got to throw their
resources into saving

654
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,374
the maximum
number of lives.

655
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,075
If my mother were rich
or a politician,

656
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,574
they'd find a way to save her.

657
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,142
Field Communications Desk.

658
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,441
This is Edgar Stiles.

659
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,207
I need another switching
station for that number.

660
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:30,374
Do you need it again?

661
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:31,975
No, I've got it logged.
Hold the line.

662
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:35,274
Thank you.

663
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:38,441
Go ahead, please.

664
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:39,474
Mom.

665
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,775
Hello, honey.

666
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:42,174
Mom, I've been
trying everything.

667
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,941
I can't get anyone
out there to help you.

668
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:46,008
I've done everything
I could. I did.

669
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,374
I'm sure you did, honey.

670
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:49,008
It's okay.

671
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:50,174
It's not okay.

672
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,675
The fallout's
coming toward you.

673
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:52,808
It's 15 miles away.

674
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,941
I know.

675
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:57,641
I'm watching it
on the news and...

676
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,341
I know what to do.

677
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,741
Ma, there's nothing you can do.

678
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:01,941
You can't stuff towels

679
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:02,941
under the door.

680
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,441
That's not what I'm talking

681
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:05,708
about doing, Edgar.

682
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:06,875
What do you mean?

683
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:08,075
They've been talking

684
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:10,474
about radiation poisoning
on the news.

685
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:11,708
That's not something

686
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:13,441
I want to go through,

687
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:17,374
especially since there's
only one way it can end.

688
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:22,908
Honey, I want
to end things on my terms

689
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:25,574
as opposed to all
that pain and suffering.

690
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,541
Mom.

691
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,374
It's the right thing to do.

692
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,307
It's the only thing-
you know that.

693
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:32,708
No, I don't.

694
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,608
You have been
a wonderful son, Edgar.

695
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:40,042
You've been a gift
to me and your father.

696
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:44,042
It's okay. I'm going
to a better place, and...

697
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,741
I'll see you there,

698
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:47,675
but not for a long time.

699
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:51,075
You've got a lot ahead
of you. Great things.

700
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:53,908
Maybe I can get someone to you.
I'll keep trying.

701
00:30:53,975 --> 00:30:56,508
You've got a very important
job to do there.

702
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:58,875
A lot of people
are counting on you.

703
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,142
So...

704
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:06,941
I'm going
to hang up now,

705
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,274
and I want
you to know

706
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:12,574
how very, very much
I love you.

707
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:13,808
Mom.

708
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,042
Ma?

709
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:44,207
Edgar, where
are you going?

710
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:45,408
Edgar!

711
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:46,808
I have to get
out of here.

712
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,608
What are you
talking about?

713
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,975
My mother. She lives next to the
San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

714
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,775
She wasn't able to
evacuate in time.

715
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:55,008
We still have five
other nuclear reactors

716
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:57,108
that are on the verge
of melting down.

717
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:58,441
I need you
at your station.

718
00:31:58,508 --> 00:31:59,941
I don't care what you need.

719
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:01,142
You better start caring.

720
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,508
You have
a choice right now.

721
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:04,508
Obey orders or end up
in a jail cell.

722
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:07,241
You're going to arrest me for
trying to save my mother's life?

723
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:09,008
Edgar, if what
you're saying is true,

724
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:12,108
there's nothing you
can do for your mother,

725
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:13,641
but there are thousands
of other people

726
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,808
whose lives you can save.

727
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,341
Suppose your mother
were here right now.

728
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:17,474
What would make her proud?

729
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:19,042
What do you think
she'd want you to do?

730
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:28,374
She'd want me to help.

731
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:30,875
Then don't you think you should?

732
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:48,708
MAN:
We're ready to go.

733
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:50,908
We're just setting up
the comm line.

734
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,975
This is a pardon for your son
signed by the president.

735
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:00,541
This is acceptable.

736
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:01,741
Where is he?

737
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:04,241
He's at Lindower
Memorial Hospital.

738
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:05,741
It's not far.

739
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:07,841
Set up a perimeter
around Lindower Memorial.

740
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:09,708
I want you to call him
and tell him we're coming

741
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:10,941
to pick him up.

742
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:12,574
Give her the phone.

743
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:16,975
We have
to record the call.

744
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:28,574
<i>( phone rings )</i>

745
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:30,108
Hello?

746
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,675
It's me. Where are you?

747
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:33,008
Waiting for Nasim.

748
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,441
I don't know why
he's taking so long.

749
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:37,474
Don't worry about that now.

750
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:38,908
Things have changed.

751
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,142
What do you mean?

752
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,941
Listen carefully,
Behrooz.

753
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:43,174
Government agents

754
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:44,975
found me.

755
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,341
I'm with them now.

756
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:50,608
Behrooz,
they know everything.

757
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,841
Behrooz, just a few
more minutes, okay?

758
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:55,508
But it's all right.

759
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:58,708
Everything is going
to be all right.

760
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:00,374
I made a deal.

761
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,875
What are
you talking about?

762
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,708
You're going
to be okay.

763
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,741
You won't be arrested-

764
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:09,441
or even named-
in any of this.

765
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:11,142
I don't understand.

766
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:16,608
I'm going to help them
stop your father.

767
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:18,574
You are?

768
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,307
Yes.

769
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:25,775
You said that I would be okay.

770
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:27,341
But what about you?

771
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:31,008
We'll talk about that later.

772
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:32,908
Right now, these men

773
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:34,941
are coming
to pick you up.

774
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:36,975
I want you to go with them.

775
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,008
Are they making you say this?

776
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:41,975
No.

777
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:44,574
I don't know
who these people are.

778
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:46,075
I want to be sure

779
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,808
that they're not
forcing you to say this.

780
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,341
I'll come with them.

781
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,075
You'll know
when you see me.

782
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:54,408
Okay?

783
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:55,808
I'll meet you outside.

784
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,142
No. Tell him to go
to the emergency room.

785
00:34:58,207 --> 00:34:59,274
I want him to stay

786
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:00,641
where it's crowded.

787
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,941
Did you hear that?

788
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,641
Yes.

789
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,142
I'll see you in a few minutes,
Behrooz.

790
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,142
Okay.

791
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,675
We're transferring
the suspect.

792
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,374
I want to set up a
protective cordon right away.

793
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:13,808
Copy that.

794
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,608
Let's go.

795
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,841
Uncle Nasim.

796
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:33,307
I have to go.

797
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,541
What about the pain medication?

798
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:38,008
My mom's getting it
from somewhere else,

799
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:39,374
but thanks for trying.

800
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:42,641
Behrooz!

801
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,941
Hey.

802
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,075
What are you doing?

803
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:46,741
I can't let you go.
Why not?

804
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:48,508
I spoke to your father.

805
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:49,508
What?

806
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:51,008
He told me
you need help.

807
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:52,207
You don't know what

808
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,975
you're talking about.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

809
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:56,307
I gave your father
my word.

810
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:57,574
My father is a terrorist.

811
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,341
He's involved
in what's happened today.

812
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,408
Stop talking, Behrooz.
I swear, it's true.

813
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:02,875
You're talking nonsense.
No, I'm not!

814
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,441
He's behind the kidnapping
this morning,

815
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:05,641
and the reactors melting down.

816
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,474
We're all involved-
my mother and me.

817
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,875
We've killed people.

818
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:14,008
Your father will be furious
when he hears this.

819
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,675
My father is coming here?

820
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:21,174
No!

821
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,108
Behrooz!

822
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:01,841
I tried to stop him.

823
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,608
You broke my heart,

824
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,108
Behrooz.

825
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,008
You broke my heart.

826
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:38,441
If you kill me, Mother
will tell them everything.

827
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:40,374
Tell who?

828
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:41,941
The police.
She's with them.

829
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,075
I don't believe you.
It's the truth.

830
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:45,808
She wants me to be safe
and, if you kill me,

831
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,274
she will ruin
everything you're doing.

832
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:49,574
Liar!
If you don't

833
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:50,574
believe me,
look outside.

834
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:51,985
They're coming to
pick me up.

835
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,785
Help!

836
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,186
Shut up!

837
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:17,386
Tony, did you
notify Security?

838
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:18,819
No.

839
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,153
Something is wrong.

840
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,153
Set up a Level Three
cordon

841
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,685
around the hospital.

842
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,219
I'm going with you.

843
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:27,386
No, you're not!

844
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,486
What's going on here?

845
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:41,453
There's been
a shooting.

846
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,486
Who? One of the pharmacists.

847
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,586
Who are you?
My name is Jack Bauer.

848
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:44,586
I work with the
Counterterrorist Unit.

849
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:45,586
We've been tracking the man

850
00:38:45,652 --> 00:38:46,919
who did the shooting.

851
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,620
Where is he? Someone just
radioed in from C wing.

852
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:50,586
Saw a Middle Eastern man
running. He has a hostage.

853
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:51,852
A 17-year-old boy?
I think so.

854
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,719
What are the possible
exits from that wing?

855
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:54,819
>From where
he was spotted,

856
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:56,119
he's pretty much
got to end up

857
00:38:56,186 --> 00:38:57,586
in the east parking garage.
We've got men

858
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:58,986
heading there now.

859
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:00,852
You tell your supervisor
to tell his men to back off.

860
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,052
No one makes
contact with him.

861
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,419
Do you understand me?
All right.

862
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:04,986
<i>( phone rings )
Hang on a sec.</i>

863
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,153
Yeah?

864
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,486
Tony, it's Jack.

865
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,785
Navi Araz is here.

866
00:39:08,852 --> 00:39:10,086
He's already killed
his wife's brother.

867
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:11,253
What about the boy?

868
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,286
I don't know.
We're going to have

869
00:39:12,353 --> 00:39:13,620
to lock down
all the exits.

870
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,652
I think he's headed
for the parking garage.

871
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,919
I need you to meet me

872
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,319
on the east side of the
building with backup.

873
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:19,319
Copy that. We're going to
the east side of the building.

874
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:20,852
We need backup teams there
right away.

875
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:29,453
What happened?

876
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,286
We're still looking
for your son.

877
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:32,620
There is more. Tell me.

878
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:35,553
Mrs. Araz, we're going
to find your son, all right?

879
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,453
I hate you.

880
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,752
I've always
hated you.

881
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,119
The only reason
I never said so

882
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:53,520
was because
I was afraid of you.

883
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,752
But I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

884
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:57,319
Get in.
Go to hell.

885
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:00,186
Get in!

886
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,253
Jack, we're in the garage now.

887
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,453
We've secured the exit.

888
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,986
I'm almost there.
Can you get an ID?

889
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:15,186
No. Nothing yet.

890
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,685
Let me see your hands!

891
00:40:39,752 --> 00:40:42,353
Put your hands where
I can see them! Now!

892
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:43,386
Careful!

893
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:44,553
Drop the gun!

894
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,253
You'll hit the boy!

895
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,286
Let the boy go!

896
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:49,785
We can work this out.

897
00:40:49,852 --> 00:40:52,453
I will put my gun down
if you give me the boy.

898
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,386
All I want is the boy.

899
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:56,161
Stay back!

900
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,052
Put the g-
Tony, stop the car!

901
00:40:58,353 --> 00:40:59,019
Behrooz!

902
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:00,119
Mom!

903
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:02,453
Keep her in the car!

904
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,219
That stairwell leads
to the basement.

905
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:05,419
He's got nowhere to go

906
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:07,620
but down.
Set up a link with CTU now!

907
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:09,553
Copy that. Call CTU.
We need backup here.

908
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,119
Mrs. Araz, calm down, we'll get
your son, all right? Calm down.

909
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:36,253
DRISCOLL: We've uploaded the plans
to you from the building department.

910
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,553
There are only three exits
from the hospital's basement.

911
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,785
We've got all entrances
and exits covered.

912
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:42,153
He's trapped down there.

913
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:44,019
Let's try to open up
a negotiation.

914
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,453
My husband
won't negotiate.

915
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,553
Why is that?

916
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,919
He doesn't need to.

917
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:50,453
He has to assume
I have agreed to help you

918
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,719
in return
for my son's safety.

919
00:41:51,785 --> 00:41:53,486
Well, he can't stay down there
with him forever.

920
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,620
He won't. In two hours,

921
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:58,520
all the reactors will have gone
critical. After that,

922
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,386
it won't matter
what I tell you,

923
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:01,819
and he can kill my son.

924
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:05,419
I am only helping you
to save his life.

925
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:09,119
I believe in our cause,
and if you can't

926
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:11,386
save my son,
I am happy to see

927
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:14,586
the reactors melt down.

928
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:18,077
Did you get that?

929
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:22,222
