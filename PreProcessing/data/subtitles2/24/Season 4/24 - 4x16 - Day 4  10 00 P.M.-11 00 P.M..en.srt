1
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:16,487
Whatever you've planned next
is going to fail.

2
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:18,653
<i>Just like everything else
you've tried today.</i>

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Almost 40 dead in a train crash,

4
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,087
many more near the San Gabriel
Island Nuclear Plant.

5
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:26,778
We managed to stop the other 103
power plants from melting down.

6
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:29,697
That's what America will remember -
that we stopped you.

7
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:33,642
No, this country will forever be afraid
to let their leaders appear in public.

8
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:36,297
For all the hatred that you have
for this country,

9
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:37,730
you don't understand it
very well.

10
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:45,001
Marwan...

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,200
The police report file
has been distributed.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
In the next few minutes,
CTU will be alerted that

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,320
the military pilot
and his family

14
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:50,673
are missing.

15
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,664
<i>What do you think
we should do?</i>

16
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,208
We have to make sure CTU

17
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:56,160
is too busy to realize
its significance.

18
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:58,920
Jack Bauer is alive
and in my custody.

19
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,048
I will return him to you unharmed

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,759
in exchange for Behrooz Araz.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,471
He'll be overseeing the operation.

22
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:09,088
<i>BILL:
Let's talk about</i>

23
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:10,119
<i>what happens if we don't</i>

24
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:10,616
agree to the exchange.

25
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:12,942
We don't get Jack Bauer back,
for one thing.

26
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:14,857
That can't be
the deciding factor here.

27
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,455
Well, most importantly,
if we don't

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,480
go through
with this exchange,

29
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,151
we may lose an oportunity
to trap Marwan.

30
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,963
Is my mother
in the van?

31
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,266
She was working with
you. Where is she?

32
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,071
- I don't know.
- I don't want to die.

33

<i>( gunshot )</i>

34

Let's move out.

35
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,742
Why'd you give them the kid?!

36
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:35,783
It's okay, he's been
double tagged.

37
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:36,502
We'll be tracking him.

38
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:39,554
BAUER: I managed to
short-circuit the phone lines

39
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:40,946
in the building
that I was being held.

40
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,438
If you can find
two service obstructions

41
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:45,245
at the same coordinates,
we can get to Marwan.

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,533
<i>( beeping )</i>

43
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,994
We have a location where
Marwan was holding Jack.

44
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:51,609
<i>( ringing )</i>

45

There'a problem.

47
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,739
<i>Just as I was about
to do a preflight check,</i>

48
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:56,937
they grounded the plane.

49
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,463
Resolve this now.

50
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:01,097
Did you make your report to
the chief mechanical officer?

51
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:03,029
I was just about to head
over there right now.

52
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:03,990
Don't let me hold you up.

53
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:04,756
<i>( silenced gunshot )</i>

54
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,392
It was just a false alarm.

55
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,044
All right.

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,109
I'll clear it for takeoff.

57
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:23,458
We placed multiple
trackers on Behrooz Araz,

58
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:25,257
but those
are no longer transmitting,

59
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:27,825
which means that Marwan's men
found and destroyed them.

60
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:30,157
Are you close to finding Marwan?

61
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:31,391
We may be, sir.

62
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,925
Jack Bauer managed
to tag the location

63
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,491
where he was being held.

64
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:37,090
We're preparing to mount a raid
on that location as we speak.

65
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,658
I want Marwan found... now.

66
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,157
I've asked Secret Service
to secure a landing site

67
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:44,624
so I can be on the ground
to address the nation

68
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,191
before the 11:00 news.

69
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:48,925
Sir, we believe that you're
safer in the air right now.

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,894
I have been flying for 20 hours.

71
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,961
The American people need to hear
from me now, not tomorrow.

72
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:57,794
Then may I like to suggest you
do it from Air Force One?

73
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,061
It may not be optimal,

74
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,861
but at least you'll
get your message across.

75
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,328
I appreciate your concerns,
but I'm going to give my speech

76
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,228
when I get to Los Angeles.

77
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,660
I'll inform the press corp,

78
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:10,794
give them enough time
to notify their outlets.

79
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:12,328
Yes, Mr. President.

80
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,228
Just make sure I'm briefed
on Bauer's progress

81
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,560
before I go on the air.

82
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,527
Of course.

83
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:22,861
What's Jack's status?

84
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:24,361
His team just arrived
at Marwan's location.

85
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:26,461
They should be in place
in a few minutes.

Well, why didn't Aziz
tell you where he hid it?

We have a problem.

162
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:50,627
What kind of problem?

163
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,328
Aziz, he hid a backup
copy of his files

164
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,161
in your apartment
on hard drive.

165
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,061
We haven't been
able to find it.

166
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:58,128
Ask Aziz.

167
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,594
Aziz is dead.

168
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:05,328
I don't know about a hard drive.

169
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:07,694
You have no idea where
he might have kept it?

170
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,861
If I knew where it was,
I'd tell you.

171
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:10,927
<i>( fizzing )</i>

172
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:14,061
I'm not trying
to get myself killed.

173
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,261
I'll get back to you.

174
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,961
Okay, in order
to flush Marwan out,

175
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:54,228
I want you to lead your men
down the main corridor.

176
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:55,861
He'll try and escape
through the left flank.

177
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:57,061
That's where I'll find him.

178
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,560
Tac team's ready
to go in on your word.

179
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,994
Have they set
the charges on the door?

180
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,994
Yes.
Gentlemen, we are a go.

181
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:04,861
We've got a green light.

182
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,428
Teams A and B,
move into position.

183
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,627
All teams, move
in on target.

184
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,961
Prepare to ignite
charges on my mark.

185
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:28,794
JACK:
Three, two, one.

186
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:29,994
Blow the door!

187
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:41,527
<i>( gunfire )</i>

188
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:42,961
Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

189
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,399
<i>Delete the files!
Delete everything!</i>

190
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:55,194
<i>( rapid gunfire )</i>

191
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,194
<i>( two gunshots )</i>

192
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,727
<i>( grunting )</i>

193
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:31,594
<i>( gunfire over speakers )</i>

194
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,827
<i>( rapid gunfire )</i>

195
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:10,727
<i>( gunfire over speakers )</i>

196
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:19,161
<i>( rapid gunfire )</i>

197
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:22,927
Hold your fire!

198
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,660
Clear!

199
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:41,888
Marwan's not here.
Notify the perimeter.

200
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,352
Team One and
Team Two, come in.

201
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:45,979
Marwan is not in the building.
Maintain your perimeter.

202
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,070
Come on!

203
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:52,343
I can't stop this thing from deleting.

204
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:10,983
This doesn't make sense.

205
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,399
This room's hot. Get your
men out of here!

206
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:20,799
Get your men out of here now!

207
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:26,743
Jack, what's happening?

208
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:28,048
What's going on over there?

209
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:30,227
- You OK?
- Yeah, I think so.

210
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:31,484
Check your men!

211
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,272
Jack, if you can hear me, respond!

212
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,786
Michelle, Marwan's escaped.

213
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,952
He just blew up the hard drives
to all his computers.

214
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,924
He's trying to cover his tracks.

215
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:40,925
I'm going off comm

216
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:42,609
If you want me I'm going
to be on my cell.

217
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:46,460
Chloe

218
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,083
Get data forensics in there now

219
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,738
and start a hard target
search for Marwan.

220
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,029
Get me a medic!
Medic!

221
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:03,471
You can't stop it

222
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:04,657
Stop what?

223
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,040
The course you'll be on

224
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:11,463
What's going to happen
within the hour?

225
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,410
What's going to happen
within the hour?

226
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,291
Mrs. Raines?

227
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:41,899
Yes.

228
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:43,984
Your husband is in Recovery.

229
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,586
How is he?

230
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,019
He's stable, but
one of the bullets

231
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:48,852
did some damage
to his spine.

232
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,352
Right now he's paralyzed
from the waist down.

233
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,152
Is it permanent...?

234
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:56,386
It's too early to tell.

235
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,919
That'll take weeks,
maybe months,

236
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,586
before we fully
understand the extent

237
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,985
of damage to his spine.

238
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,286
So it's possible he could regain
the use of his legs.

239
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,653
It's possible, yes.

240
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,553
But not likely.

241
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,718
Again, it's
too early to tell.

242
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:14,785
We could go over
the details later,

243
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:19,785
but I'd be lying to you if
I told you I was optimistic.

244
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:21,586
A lot depends
on his attitude,

245
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:23,219
his support system-

246
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:25,653
emotional as well as medical.

247
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,519
Does he know?

248
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,352
Yes. I just told him.

249
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,852
I'm sure he'd like
to see you.

250
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:01,085
Excuse me, can you
give us a minute?

251
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:12,452
Oh, no, don't even think
of feeling sorry for me.

252
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,386
Whatever they say,
I'm going to walk again.

253
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,553
I know you will.

254
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,919
So, where's Jack?

255
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,852
He's still out in the field.

256
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,553
He called
a little while ago,

257
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,085
wanted to know
how you're doing.

258
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:42,519
He knows that bullet
was meant for him.

259
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:45,852
I was just trying to
push him out of the way,

260
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,952
I didn't expect
to get shot myself.

261
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,818
What you did was very,
very brave, Paul.

262
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,186
LAPD's widening their
search perimeter,

263
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:12,052
but so far they're
coming up empty.

264
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,152
Jack said something might
happen within the hour.

265
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:15,252
If we don't find Marwan...

266
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,586
We're going to find him.

267
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,119
Did you secure Marwan yet?

268
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:21,352
No. He must've slipped
through the perimeter.

269
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,019
How the hell could you
let that happen?

270
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,386
Doesn't matter
how it happened.

271
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:25,752
What matters
is that he's gone

272
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,752
and we're doing everything
we can to find him.

273
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:31,952
What exactly are you
doing to find him?

274
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,386
We've widened the perimeter,

275
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:35,186
set up a search grid.
State police

276
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:36,919
and LAPD are conducting a sweep.

277
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:38,319
Jack's on line two.

278
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,653
He says he's got something.

279
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:41,685
Put him on the speaker.

280
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:42,885
Jack, it's Michelle.

281
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,586
You're also on with Tony
and Bill Buchanan

282
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,152
from Division.

283
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,619
Okay, look, Marwan had an area
set up for forging documents.

284
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:50,186
Some of them made it
through the explosion.

285
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:53,286
We managed to secure a number
of names and faces.

286
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,219
Agent Castle is uploading
them to your server now.

287
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,319
I want you to cross-reference
them with the watch lists.

288
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,885
We'll get on it right away.

289
00:15:58,952 --> 00:16:00,419
Okay, get back to me
if you've got a match.

290
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,052
Edgar...

291
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,085
I'm initializing the facial
recognition software now.

292
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,252
Good.

293
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,419
BUCHANAN:
Michelle...

294
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:13,619
Listen, I'm sorry
if I snapped.

295
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:14,619
It's okay.

296
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:15,852
We're all under
a lot of pressure.

297
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:19,419
You holding up?

298
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,685
Fine.

299
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,386
Edgar, how's that uplink?

300
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:30,486
Coming up.

301
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,419
Chloe...

302
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,718
how long has Buchanan been
at Division? I don't know.

303
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,818
It took them a while to fill
Chapelle's position. 6 months?

304
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:42,885
Where he was
before that?

305
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,752
Seattle, I think.

306
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,718
Seattle?

307
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:48,352
Yeah, that's where
Michelle was posted

308
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,052
while you were in jail, right?

309
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,419
Yeah.

310
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,718
Thanks.

311
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:58,186
Got a match.

312
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,586
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

313
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,219
This is Bauer.

314
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,419
MICHELLE: Jack, we have got a
match on one of those photos.

315
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:10,186
He's on the FBI's watch list.
His name is Mitch Anderson.

316
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,486
What do we got on him?

317
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:12,852
Ex-military,

318
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,286
arrested for drug possession.

319
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:15,685
Served time in military prison,

320
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,919
was dishonorably
discharged four years ago.

321
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:20,252
Since then he's been
hired as a mercenary

322
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,752
in a number of conflicts
around the world,

323
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,186
came back to the U.S.
about a year ago.

324
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,919
Is he under active
investigation?

325
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,085
He was moved up the list
when we raised the alert,

326
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:28,653
but he wasn't made
a priority.

327
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:30,752
The Bureau sent an agent over
to check out his apartment.

328
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,152
Has the agent
checked back in yet?

329
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,718
They may still be in transit.

330
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,685
Okay, I want you to get me
an address on Anderson.

331
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:37,586
Start digging up as much
information as you can.

332
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:39,619
And get me a contact number
for the FBI agent.

333
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,852
I'm on it.

334
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:46,919
FBI.

335
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,452
I'm looking for Mitch Anderson.

336
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:53,519
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

337
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,619
This FBI Agent Drake.
Please open the door.

338
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,419

339

<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

341
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,452
Agent Drake.

342
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,919
Hi, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working with CTU.

343
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,885
I'm looking for a man
named Mitch Anderson.

344
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,718
Your office said
you were investigating him.

345
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,785
I just got to his apartment
a few minutes ago.

346
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:44,119
What do you mean,
he's not there?

347
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:46,219
No. Why is CTU involved?

348
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:48,052
Is there new information
about Anderson?

349
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,085
We have evidence connecting him
to a man named Habib Marwan.

350
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:52,319
Marwan's been responsible

351
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,286
for all the terrorist activity
earlier today.

352
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,885
We also have reason
to believe

353
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:57,152
he's planning
another attack.

354
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,785
Well, how is
Anderson involved?

355
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,486
I'll advise you
when I get there.

356
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,653
How far away are you?

357
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:04,052
About ten minutes out.

358
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,019
I'll be here.

359
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:07,352
Thank you.

360
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:50,998
MAN ( over phone ):
Yes?

361
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,564
We had a slight delay.

362
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:54,132
I'm heading over there now.

363
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:55,499
What about Anderson?

364
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:57,865
He's in the air,
on his way to the target.

365
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,332
Everything's on schedule.

366
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,898
Are your people in place?

367
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,931
Yes. We're ready to deploy.

368
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:06,198
Good. I'll see you
when we arrive.

369
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:16,065
Sorry, but this
just isn't cutting it.

370
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,698
The tone is all wrong.
Sir, maybe I

371
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:18,965
could give the
speechwriters

372
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:20,465
a clearer idea
of what you want.

373
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,399
This is one
of the most traumatic days

374
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,232
in the history of this country.

375
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:25,931
What I want...

376
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:28,831
is a speech that is equal
to the occasion.

377
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,698
<i>( sighs )</i>

378
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:36,865
Give me a few minutes,
will you, Robert?

379
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:39,698
Let me... think about this
a little while longer.

380
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:41,998
Of course,
Mr. President.

381
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:45,198
Oh, and, Robert, ask my son
to step in, will you?

382
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,931
Yes, sir.

383
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,132
Dad?

384
00:20:57,598 --> 00:21:01,731
Well, a quick trip to Mexico,
a low-key state visit,

385
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:04,198
and then we'd finally have
some time to spend together.

386
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:07,598
It's okay. The, uh, press corp's
been keeping me entertained.

387
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:11,698
You know,
ever since your mother died,

388
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:14,465
I promised myself
I'd be there for you.

389
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:16,998
You've been doing
what you had to do.

390
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:22,531
I could, uh, use your help
right about now.

391
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,765
I'm going to be
addressing the nation

392
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,831
in about one hour,
and I still don't have

393
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:28,265
a speech that
I'm happy with.

394
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:29,965
<i>( chuckles ):
I'm no speechwriter.</i>

395
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:31,098
No, I know.

396
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,332
But you've got a level head,

397
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,432
and you're about
the most decent person

398
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:36,965
I know.

399
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:38,798
As far as I'm concerned,

400
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,365
you represent the very best
this country has to offer.

401
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:45,065
So...

402
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:47,132
what do you want to hear
the president say

403
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:48,898
when he addresses you tonight?

404
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,365
The truth.

405
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,598
We've been attacked
by terrorists.

406
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:04,598
Americans are dead.

407
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:06,564
The man responsible
is still at large,

408
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,165
and we are
by no means certain

409
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:10,631
that we can catch him
before he strikes again.

410
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:13,931
What happened earlier...

411
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:17,365
may be nothing compared
to what happens next.

412
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,765
That's the truth, Kevin.

413
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,465
Is that what you think
I should say?

414
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:29,465
I don't know.

415
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:33,132
Neither do I.

416
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,531
But the fact remains...

417
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:40,365
...I have to say something.

418
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:44,931
Y-You want me to help you
figure it out?

419
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:50,132
Absolutely.

420
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,965
Agent Drake?

421
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:16,698
Agent Drake?

422
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,032
Drop the weapon!

423
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:29,265
Drop the weapon now!

424
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:31,065
Are you Agent Bauer?
Yes!

425
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,265
Now, holster your weapon!

426
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:33,931
- I need to se your I.D.
- I don't have

427
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,831
identification-
I'm working with CTU

428
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,232
on a provisional basis.

429
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:38,831
I talked to you ten minutes ago.

430
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:40,399
Call Division
and confirm.

431
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,531
Agent Drake,

432
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:43,232
just take it easy.

433
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,598
He's with me.

434
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,165
Agent Hart, CTU.

435
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:47,931
Now, I'm gonna
holster my gun.

436
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:50,499
I'm gonna show you
my credentials.

437
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:00,698
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:02,232
With everything
that happened today,

439
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:03,432
you can't be too careful.

440
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:04,765
I understand.

441
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:07,865
Agent Bauer, we just
intercepted a call

442
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:10,232
indicating that Anderson
was in possession

443
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:13,232
of computer files that could
tell us Marwan's next target.

444
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:14,664
What's the source
of the intercepted call?

445
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,132
I'm still waiting
for the details.

446
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:20,898
Did you find the apartment
in this condition?

447
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:22,465
No. My ASAC thinks
that Anderson

448
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:24,865
may have hidden a backup copy
of the files here.

449
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,831
I was trying to find it.

450
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,898
Right now Anderson's
our only lead.

451
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:35,465
We're gonna stay here and help you
finish the job.

452
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,765
Do a canvass.
We'll take upstairs.

453
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:48,898
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

454

I'm almost in position.

456
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,465
What's the problem?

457
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,499
Is my cover in place?

458
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,965
I've told you before-
yes.

459
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:06,998
You'll be 100% safe.

460
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:11,032
Marwan, they have
to believe I'm dead.

461
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:14,165
They will. My people
have taken care of this.

462
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:15,664
They better.

463
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,265
Because once this is done,

464
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,098
the entire world is gonna be
looking for me.

465
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,166
Mm-hmm. I understand.

466
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,033
Yeah, I'll tell him.

467
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,733
Thanks, Ruben.

00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:55,433
I have some bad news.

Do you want me to tell you here
or somewhere private?

472

- What?
- I just got off the phone with Ruben Weiss

473
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:02,932
from OSHA, and he said
they're not gonna be able

474
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,667
to get in the area
where your mother died.

475
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,066
for a few weeks, maybe months.

Why not?

477
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,767
Think about it.

00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:11,099
Half-life? Radiation?

479
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,533
What does that mean?

480
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,899
Well, he didn't spell it out,
but I think that means

481
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:17,733
you're gonna have to have
your funeral without the body

482

Of your mother

I can't deal with this
right now, Chloe.

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,633
Michelle needs prioritized lists
for Marwan's pursuit plan.

485
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:28,500
Oh.

486
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,066
Okay, good.

487
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,099
Do you want me
to do that for you?

488
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,932
No.

489
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:08,667
LAPD's locked down the area
where Marwan was last seen.

490
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,433
I need you to review
the search grid.

491
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,433
All right.
Okay, thanks.

492
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,799
Michelle.

493
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,966
When were you planning
on telling me?

494
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,899
About what?

495
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,999
TONY:
About you and Buchanan.

496
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:27,667
Never. Because it's none
of your business.

497
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,400
Michelle.

498
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:32,199
Before you worked with him at Division,
you worked with him

499
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,866
in Seattle on Homeland Security
restructuring, right?

500
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:38,300
- Yeah.
- We were still married then.

501
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,533
Legally, yes.

502
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,832
Did you sleep with him
while we were married?

503
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:46,033
No.

504
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,533
I didn't.

505
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,667
But you are now.

506
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:54,199
Like I said,
it's none of your business.

507
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,566
Edgar, where are those updates?

508
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,633
Coming right up.

509
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,767
<i>( quietly ):
Edgar, what are you doing?</i>

510
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:26,400
- Miss Dessler.
- Edgar, wait.

511
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,533
- What?
- Wait, before you turn that in,

512
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,667
I made a mistake-
I used Row-Major format

513
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,999
instead of Column-Major.

514
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,566
Why would you do that, Chloe?

515
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,300
You know Row-Major isn't compatible
with our software.

516
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:40,099
- It'll bring all our processors to a crawl.
- I know. It was a mistake.

517
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,566
I thought it was going
to Division.

518
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,767
Well, fix it.

519
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,099
Chloe, that was

520
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,767
my mistake- why'd
you cover for me?

521
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:51,733
- You're welcome.
- You'd have had your job back

522
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,500
if you would've let me
hand her the disk.

523
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,266
I thought you had
a lot on your mind.

524
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,799
Agent Bauer?

525
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:47,266
Yeah?

526
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:59,033
I checked with the neighbors-
nobody's seen

527
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,600
- Mitch Anderson today.
- Did you talk to the manager?

528
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,133
Yeah, Anderson
kept to himself.

529
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:06,099
Paid his rent on time-
the ideal tenant.

530
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,866
Okay, thanks.

531
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,199
Agent Drake?

532
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,633
Yes?

533
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,500
Anderson was ex-military,
dishonorably discharged.

534
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,433
This bag is from Vanguard Mills.

535
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,566
They manufacture medals
for the armed forces.

536
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,099
There's a date stamp on it,
three months old.

537
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,667
Anderson left the military
four years ago.

538
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,999
You think he's currently posing
as military.

539
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,700
It's a distinct possibility-
I want you to let

540
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,133
your people know;
we'll do the same.

541
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,733
Have this scanned and send
it over to Chloe at CTU.

542
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,700
You got it.

543
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,700
This is Special Agent Drake.

544
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,932
Can you put me through
to Dawson, please?

545
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,799
Thank you.

546
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,966
<i>( line ringing )</i>

547
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,066
CTU. Almeida.
Tony, it's Jack.

548
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,767
We just found some evidence
that indicates

549
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,500
that Anderson might be posing
as military.

550
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:06,932
I want you to update
the profiles,

551
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,799
- see if anything comes back.
- All right, I'm on it.

552
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,366
Okay, thanks.

553
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,899
Yeah, this is Drake.

554
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:15,199
Listen, we just found
credible evidence suggesting

555
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,533
that Anderson is disguised
as military.

556
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,333
That's right.

557
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,466
Yes.

558
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:24,667
Fine.

559
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,033
Yes.

560
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,400
No, that's not a problem.

561
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:38,999
Good.

562
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,767
All right.
Well, thanks.

563
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,832
I'll let you know
if we find anything else.

564
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:47,466
Hey.

565
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,133
I found something.

566
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,667
It's an external hard drive-
this is exactly

567
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,966
what we're looking for.
That's good work.

568
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:44,633
Drop the weapon!

569
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,799

Edgar, it's Jack.
Where's Chloe?

574
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:52,199
She's busy doing
a systems update.

575
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:53,932
Okay. I need you to tell
Michelle and Tony

576
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,166
that the FBI agent that I met
at Anderson's apartment

577
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,633
was an impostor working
for Marwan.

578
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,633
I killed her, but not before
she took out my backup.

579
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,633
CTU needs to send out

580
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,999
a team, lock down the apartment

581
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:03,333
and initiate an investigation.

582
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,799
Do you want to tell them
yourself?

583
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,333
No, you can tell them
in a second.

584
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,767
Right now, I need you to help me
pull some data off a hard drive.

585
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,500
The directory's locked.
Hold on one second;

586
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:12,832
I'm going to put you on
speakerphone.

587
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:13,832
Okay, go ahead.

588
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,099
Can you get into the root?

589
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,667
Yeah, but I can't
open the files.

590
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:17,866
Okay, hold down tab and arrow

591
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:20,366
until the manufacturer's
code appears.

592
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:24,266
Okay, I got it.

593
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,733
What are the last three digits
on the part code?

594
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,799
R-Two-Five.

595
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:32,133
Escape out and enter pass
code C-I-S-Eight-Three-R.

596
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,767
That should backdoor
you into the files.

<i>( whisper ):

599
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,333
Yeah, I'm in. I need to speak
to Michelle and Tony now.

600
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,333
I'll get 'em.

601
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Jack's on the line.

602
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,932
Jack, what is it?

603
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,266
I pulled some data
off a hard drive

604
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,999
that we found hidden
in Anderson's apartment.

605
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,832
On it is a flight simulator
and full schematics

606
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,633
to an F-117A Stealth fighter.

607
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,566
Anderson's an experienced pilot.

608
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,300
I know. I also think
he's posing as military.

609
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:13,133
I believe Mitch Anderson's

610
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,633
trying to steal
a Stealth fighter.

611
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:29,010
Tony, I'm on my way in.
What's the holdup?

612
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:32,710
- Have you gotten anything from the airport?
- Hang on, it's coming through.

613
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:36,578
Central Air Command reports
that an F-117A Stealth fighter

614
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,743
took off on a scheduled mission
about 40 minutes ago.

615
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,944
Now, the pilot did not call in
on schedule.

616
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,578
That was about six minutes ago.

617
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,977
All attempts to contact
that pilot have failed.

618
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:46,710
Okay, that's it.
We have to assume

619
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,177
Anderson's flying
that plane.

620
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,277
Yeah, I agree.

621
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,511
Is the aircraft armed?

622
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:52,710
Yeah, standard
non-nuclear ordinance.

623
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,411
We're going to have to work up
a list

624
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:55,743
of obvious possible targets.

625
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,277
Yeah. Right. I'm working
that up right now.

626
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:00,077
Wait.

627
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:01,944
Air Force One is headed to L.A.

628
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,211
Jack, did you hear that?

629
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:05,810
Yeah, what's the ETA?

630
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,544
11:00 p. m.

631
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:13,910
Oh, my God.

632
00:36:13,977 --> 00:36:15,544
They're going after
the President.

633
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:16,977
I'll call Air Force One.

634
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,177
Tony, we don't have a lot of time.
I need you to get me

635
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,311
the recall frequency
for that plane's squadron.

636
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:23,477
And send Anderson's bio
over to my screen.

637
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:24,611
Yeah, I'm on it.

638
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:26,311
- Where's Buchanan?
- He's in Tactical,

639
00:36:26,377 --> 00:36:27,944
talking directly
with the military.

640
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,444
Tell him he's going to have to
tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff

641
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,611
that we believe the likely
target is President Keeler

642
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:34,010
aboard Air Force One.

643
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,244
You really have been
helpful, Kevin.

644
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:40,843
I think this speech strikes
just the right note.

645
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,277
Mr. President,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

646
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:45,177
It's Michelle Dessler at CTU.

647
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,044
She says it's urgent.

648
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,044
Yes, what is it, Ms. Dessler?

649
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,477
Mr. President, we have reason to
believe that a Stealth fighter

650
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,511
has been stolen by a terrorist...

651
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:57,843
and is in your airspace
as we speak.

652
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,710
This plane is due
to land shortly,

653
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:01,843
and I'm about to
address the country.

654
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,678
Just how sure are
we about this?

655
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:05,777
It's a near certainty,
Mr. President.

656
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:07,743
We've informed your pilot,
and he's preparing

657
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,910
to combine evasive action
with immediate descent.

658
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,578
You're cleared to land
in Palm Springs.

659
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:15,311
I'm sure my escort fighters
are perfectly capable

660
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:16,944
of protecting Air Force One.

661
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,843
Mr. President, this
is a Stealth aircraft,

662
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,211
invisible to radar.

663
00:37:21,277 --> 00:37:23,044
If he finds you,
he may be on you

664
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,177
before your fighter
escort can react.

665
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,810
What are the chances
he'll find us?

666
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,444
We can't be sure, Mr. President.

667
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:31,110
But the radar signature
of a 747 and four fighter planes

668
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,611
is unmistakable.

669
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:36,710
You're telling me that this
stolen Stealth plane

670
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:38,977
will attempt
to shoot me down?

671
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:41,511
It looks that way,
Mr. President.

672
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:43,678
I see.

673
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:47,044
Dad...

674
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,177
It's going to be okay.

675
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:51,678
It seems our plane
may come under attack.

676
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:53,244
We're going to take
some precautions.

677
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:55,244
Get me the Vice President
on the phone.

678
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:56,944
Yes, sir.

679
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:11,344
All right, Jack, it should be
coming through right now.

680
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:14,077
Yeah, I've got it.

681
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:15,544
Not much to go on.
Parents deceased.

682
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,477
He has a sister named Alicia.
Looks like they might

683
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:19,010
have lived together
at the same address

684
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:20,944
for a number of years,
so they might be close.

685
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,311
Any recent contact information?

686
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:24,211
No. Let me see if I
can find that for you.

687
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:26,077
No, we don't have any time.
Have you got

688
00:38:26,144 --> 00:38:27,411
- the recall frequency?
- Yeah.

689
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:27,544
Get ready to patch me through
to Anderson.

690
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:31,311
Copy that.

691
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:37,444
Air Force One is descending
through 20,000 feet.

692
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:40,010
The fighters have formed
a protective shield.

693
00:38:40,077 --> 00:38:42,144
How long before it touches down?

694
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:43,977
Nine minutes.

695
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:46,010
And the fighters report
no sign of Stealth aircraft?

696
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:47,010
Not yet.

697
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,044
Maybe it's not there.

698
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,877
It's there,
we just can't see it.

699
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:53,244
We're being beaten
by our own technology.

700
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:56,743
Jack, you're set.

701
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,144
When you hit
your intercom button,

702
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,177
you'll be patched through
to the Stealth fighter.

703
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:01,277
Copy that.

704
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,144
<i>( beeping )</i>

705
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:15,411
JACK:
Mitch Anderson, can you hear me?

706
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:18,110
Captain Anderson,
do you read me?

707
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:22,144
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a federal agent.

708
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:25,477
We know who you are, we know
what you're trying to do.

709
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:29,810
Sir, I know you can hear me.

710
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:33,010
<i>Nothing you've done so far
can't be undone.</i>

711
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:35,411
All you have to do is
change your vector

712
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:37,511
to heading one-one-
five-southeast.

713
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:41,077
That'll put you on a fast track
to Andrews Air Force Base.

714
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:45,344
Once you touch down, then we can
discuss how you want to handle his.

715
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,277
Please just talk to me.

716
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,544
Explain to me
what you're trying to do,

717
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:53,010
what you're trying
to accomplish.

718
00:39:53,077 --> 00:39:55,810
Why?

719
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,244
I've been going over
your service record.

720
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:06,277
It's very impressive.

721
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,110
Graduated top of your class,
Air Force Academy.

722
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:12,678
Highly decorated for your
service in Desert Storm,

723
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,944
including Air Force
Silver Star.

724
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,311
What happened to you?

725
00:40:17,377 --> 00:40:21,010
Explain it to me.

726
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:23,311
Because what you're trying
to do right now...

727
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:27,177
I don't think
that's who you are.

728
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:30,477
I don't think that's how
you want to be remembered.

729
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:35,044
If I go down,
you have to stay the course.

730
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,611
Do you understand?

731
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,477
Mr. President, I'm... I'm sure
it won't come to that.

732
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:41,511
KEELER: Charles, you're
the Vice President.

733
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,144
The nation will be
relying on you.

734
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:45,077
If the worst happens,

735
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:48,077
think of me
as a casualty of war.

736
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:49,578
Don't waste time.

737
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:52,611
Just pick up the torch
and move forward.

738
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:57,110
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

739
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,578
Mr. President, we think CTU
is in communication

740
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:03,477
with the pilot of
the stolen aircraft.

741
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,244
Patch it through.

742
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,777
JACK: I've just been notified
by the FBI that they've contacted

743
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,010
your sister, Alicia.

744
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:13,077
They've advised her
of what's happening.

745
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:14,344
She's scared.

746
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:16,910
She wants to talk to you.

747
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:19,910
All you have to do,
Captain Anderson,

748
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,644
is respond to me, and I'll put her
right through.

749

<i>( static crackles )</i>

Captain Anderson?!

751
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:33,544
Chloe, I think
we've been cut off.

752
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:34,810
Is there an override channel?

753
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:36,244
He's cut off all
communication circuits.

754
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:37,877
I don't think there's
anything we can do.

755
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:38,977
Damn it!

756
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,010
Dad...

757
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,578
