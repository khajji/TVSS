Previously On 24

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,767
We know you printed a document
before the EMP detonated.

7
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:17,816
Where is it?

8
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:20,954
You decide when the pain stops.

9
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:25,721
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!

10
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:30,536
Paul, where's the data printout?

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,390
I hid it.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,530
Is this it?

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,430
Yeah, it's in code.

14
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:36,391
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

15
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:37,923
We're gonna get it back to CTU.

16
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:41,162
Tony, I appreciate you carrying
the ball until Michelle got here.

17
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,402
Why don't bring her and
everyone else up to speed.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,593
The man responsible for
planning today's attacks, Habib

19
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:49,473
Marwan, has been a long-term
employee of McLennan-forster.

20
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:53,155
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the
company to inspect his computer files.

21
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,627
As they were doing so, an
electromagnetic pulse bomb

22
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:58,333
was detonated, wiping out the
company's entire data base.

23
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,809
We have to assume whoever
detonated the EMP thinks

24
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,577
Jack and Paul found something
and wants them eliminated.

25
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:05,266
Where do we go now?

26
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,670
Weapons and ammunition.

27
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,666
Get out of here or the next one won't miss.

28
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,491
I'm a federal agent.

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,779
Look, we need your help!

30
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,155
Who's after you?

31
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,403
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,158
I have critical evidence that I
need to get to the authorities.

33
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,089
If you're fighting the people
who caused today's bloodshed,

34
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:24,716
then we'll help you.

35
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:28,738
It's time.

36
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:41,165
Jack!

37
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:42,369
I'm here!

38
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:43,462
You and Raines safe?

39
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:44,143
Yeah.

40
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,406
I need you to get this to CTU.

41
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,115
It needs to get decoded immediately.

42
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,076
Jack, look out!

43
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:53,306
Paul...

44
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,399
Paul!

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,699
Get me a medic!

46
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,402
It is time for you to go.

47
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:03,303
Are you ready?

48
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,050
Yes, of course.

49
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,835
Proceed as planned.

50
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,978
The president of the united
states is on a tight schedule.

51
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:12,360
We can't be late.

52
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:17,797
The following takes place
between 8:00 p. m. and 9:00 p. m.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,520
He's bleeding out!

54
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:28,342
Tell them on the ground we need
two liters of a-positive hemo.

55
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,700
Come on, Paul, stay with us.

56
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,531
We're almost there.

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,114
Hello?

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,313
Audrey, it's me.

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,814
Oh, Jack, thank god you're all right.

60
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,028
Audrey, I need you to listen to me.

61
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,073
Paul's been shot!

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,454
Audrey?

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,391
Audrey?

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,948
How bad is it?

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,384
The medics are working on him.

66
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,645
We'll be there in a few minutes.

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,211
Jack, how did this happen?

68
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,965
We were securing the area.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,559
One of the gunmen tried to shoot me.

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,243
Paul pushed me out of the way.

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,800
He saved my life.

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,085
Audrey?

73
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,759
I'm here. I just...

74
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,987
Jack, I don't know what to say.

75
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,512
You don't have to say anything.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Surgeons have been notified.

77
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:35,465
They're standing by.

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,922
I want you to know we're going
to do everything we have to.

79
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,096
You understand that?

80
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,063
Yeah, I understand.

81
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,446
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,190
I got...,I got to go.

83
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,600
See you in a minute.

84
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:49,608
Yeah, okay.

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,030
Mr. President, all the evidence
we've gathered confirms that this man,

86
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,182
Habib Marwan is directly responsible
for everything that's happened today.

87
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:13,053
The train derailment, my abduction, the
sabotage of our nuclear power plants...

88
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,115
does any of your evidence suggest
that he's planning more attacks?

89
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,993
I'm afraid so.

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,765
NSA is reporting a spike in chatter.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,345
They're sifting through
the intel now, trying

92
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,000
to determine potential
targets and time frames.

93
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,421
"Trying" is not good enough.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
The chopper carrying Paul
is about to land, sir.

95
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,851
We need to preempt any further attacks.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,065
I understand, sir.

97
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,667
Our best chance to do that
is by capturing Marwan.

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,433
How close are you?

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Jack Bauer recovered a document we believe
contains contact data on Marwan's network.

100
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:45,744
CTU is using it to track Marwan.

101
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,309
And if that fails?

102
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,883
Mr. President, we just have
to hope that it doesn'T.

103
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,309
Jim, today's events are continuing to
generate an unprecedented level of fear.

104
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,451
I'm not sure the social and civil fabric of
this country can withstand another attack.

105
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,504
We need to make provisions.

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,613
Provisions?

107
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,879
The civil unrest that
I believe is inevitable

108
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,777
in the event of another terrorist strike.

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,406
Are you saying we should
impose martial law?

110
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,025
I've asked General Wakefield to meet with
you in Los Angeles to discuss our options.

111
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,950
When?

112
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:18,565
Now.

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,537
His plane landed.

114
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,607
He'll be calling you to
confirm a secure location.

115
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,848
And, Jim...

116
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,708
keep this between us.

117
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,739
Of course, Mr. President.

118
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
All right, he's losing pressure.

119
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,000
I need ten CC's of
adrenaline, no compression.

120
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:04,677
Let's go.

121
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,713
Paul?

122
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,074
Paul, can you hear me?

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,771
-Got to get him into surgery now go!
-Paul...

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,588
I'm sorry...

125
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,017
please, tell me he's not going to die.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,683
Come here.

127
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,091
Jack, tell me.

128
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,668
We don't know.

129
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:31,666
We just don't know.

130
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,050
Jack, are you okay?

131
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,265
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,500
Listen, we were able to decode and
pull a name of the list you sent us.

133
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,365
Who is it?

134
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,665
Someone on our watch list.

135
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,303
But we had no idea he
was connected to Marwan.

136
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:50,907
Come on inside. We'll talk you through it.

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,819
I'm sorry, Mrs. Raines,
you need to stay out

138
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,349
here while your husband's
prepped for surgery.

139
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:01,498
Please, can I just talk
to him for a second?

140
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,592
Paul, hey..

141
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,206
hey, it's Audrey.

142
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,533
Listen to me.

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,722
I just want you to know
that I'm here, okay?

144
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,820
I'm here.

145
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,780
We need to prep him now.

146
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,790
And I will be here when
you get out of surgery.

147
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:18,724
Do you understand me?

148
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,003
Paul...

149
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,641
His name's Joseph Fayed, associate
professor at Green University.

150
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:36,668
Chemical engineering.

151
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,100
He came to the U.S. In 1985
to get his graduate degree.

152
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,099
We're sending in a team to pick him up now.

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,698
That's a mistake.

154
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,472
Why?

155
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,982
From everything that we've seen today,

156
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,800
Marwan's vetted his inner
circle very carefully.

157
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:48,565
That man will die before he says anything.

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,889
You're probably right, Jack, but
what can we do besides arrest Fayed?

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,165
Send someone in undercover.

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,775
Take a chance.

161
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:57,865
They might lead us to Marwan.

162
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,298
Come on, Jack, you know we don't have the

163
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,900
time to put one of our
own people undercover.

164
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:02,500
I'm not talking about one of our people.

165
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:03,650
Dina Araz.

166
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,193
She's already made her deal, Jack.

167
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,491
We granted her son immunity.

168
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,668
We have nothing left to offer her.

169
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,665
Maybe, maybe not.

170
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,965
Let me talk to her while
you mobilize a tactical team.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,345
If I can't get her to cooperate by the
time they're ready, send them in, but it's

172
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:17,059
simple- we either
find Marwan or we will

173
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,894
not be able to stop what
he's planning next.

174
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,175
Meet them at the hotel on Old River
Road, half a kilometer from the base.

175
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,020
When?

176
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,475
Leave now.

177
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,415
I'll need his entire flight package,

178
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,784
including clearance and
identification codes.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,579
You'll have whatever you need.

180
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,140
Is that all you've got?

181
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,521
Oh, for now it is.

182
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,565
Oh, come on.

183
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,123
I haven't seen you in two weeks.

184
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah, I've got to get to the base.

185
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm flying tonight.

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,208
Damn, I'm going to be late as it is.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,533
Look at me, I'm all wrinkled.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,859
I wouldn't worry about that.

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,017
Hello.

190
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,990
It's for you.

191
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,605
What?

192
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,457
It's your wife.

193
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,590
That's your cell phone.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,729
Laurie.

195
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,727
They've got guns, John.

196
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,437
They say they'll kill the children
unless you do what they want.

197
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,201
What's going on, Laurie? Who's there?

198
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,262
I don't know.

199
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,171
Listen to me,Laurie, whoever's
there, you put them on the phone.

200
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,593
Please, John, don't let
them hurt the children!

201
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,123
Laurie... Laurie.

202
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,528
Put your clothes on, John.

203
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,770
Curtis is prepping the tactical teams.

204
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,464
Which means you have
five minutes to do this.

205
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,172
Do you recognize this man?

206
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,513
No.

207
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,543
He's connected to Marwan.

208
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,461
I don't know him.

209
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,797
I already told the other agent.

210
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,382
Marwan doesn't permit
communication between cells.

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,665
His name is Joseph Fayed.

212
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,806
He's a professor at green university.

213
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,753
You know more about him than I do.

214
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,231
He's also our only way to reach Marwan.

215
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,581
We can't do that without your help.

216
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,491
Why should I help you?

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,535
I've already gotten all I'm
going to get for cooperating.

218
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,632
That's not necessarily true.

219
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,017
I know you love your son.

220
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,816
You've already shown me that today.

221
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,226
But unless you help us get to Fayed,

222
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,534
that will be the last time you
see him for the rest of your life.

223
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,352
This is Dessler.

224
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,110
All right, have them stand by.

225
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,865
Tactical teams are ready.

226
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,048
They can be at Fayed's
house in ten minutes.

227
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,327
Let's give him another minute.

228
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,224
I'm offering you your freedom, Dina.

229
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,100
You and Behrooz will be put in
a witness protection program.

230
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:20,554
You'll be given new names,
identities, everything.

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,158
This is a better deal
than you made earlier.

232
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,381
I'm offering you a life with your son.

233
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,447
Right now, the only question
is: Which life do you want?

234
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,420
What do you need me to do?

235
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,389
I need you to go to Fayed and tell
him that you need to speak to Marwan.

236
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,737
He won't let me through his front
door, let alone get near Marwan.

237
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,767
He will when you tell him that you've
got a hostage that can help him.

238
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,065
A hostage?

239
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,875
Who?

240
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,272
Me.

241
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,415
So what's this all about?

242
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,807
What are you doing?

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,406
I'm delivering you to someone.

244
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,167
Who?

245
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,744
I don't know.

246
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,100
You don't know who you work for?

247
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,722
I work for myself.

248
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,565
Somebody's paying you.

249
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,024
I don't ask them who they
are and they don't tell me.

250
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,203
That's how I stay alive.

251
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,998
All right, it's time.

252
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,432
If you don't cooperate,
your family will die.

253
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,005
Do you understand?

254
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,779
It's all there.

255
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,684
Get out of here.

256
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,458
Get your things.

257
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,187
We got a plane to catch.

258
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,139
Increased chatter indicates that habib
Marwan is planning another strike.

259
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:54,537
It's imperative that we locate him
before he's able to trigger this.

260
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,406
We are mounting an
undercover operation that

261
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,417
we hope will lead us to
him through this man...

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,585
Joseph Fayed.

263
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,538
We've struck a deal with Dina
Araz to work undercover for us,

264
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,694
and approach Fayed.

265
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,234
But Marwan knows we had
Dina Araz in custody.

266
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,465
We're trying to use that to our advantage.

267
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,235
Jack will run us through the
cover story we've fabricated.

268
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,424
The cover story goes as follows:

269
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:16,332
An hour ago,

270
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,753
I was transporting Dina Araz to the
federal detention center when my vehicle

271
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:23,085
was attacked by the surviving members
of a terrorist cell run by Navi Araz

272
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,750
at the intersection of
sepulveda and national.

273
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:28,100
I managed to kill or
wound all of the attackers.

274
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,455
But during the engagement,

275
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:32,906
Dina Araz secured one of the
weapons and took me hostage.

276
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,622
She'll take me to Fayed.

277
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,224
Hopefully, he'll take me to Marwan.

278
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,497
And if Marwan takes the
bait, we track you to him.

279
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,222
Yeah.

280
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,272
Now we have to assume they're
going to search both Jack and Dina,

281
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,645
which is going to make tracking
and surveillance devices a problem.

282
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,065
We're going to have to
handle this passively.

283
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,016
We're going to use satellite,
parabolics and laser aggregators.

284
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,131
But what about Dina Araz?

285
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,232
Do you think she'll be able
to play this convincingly?

286
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,344
Well, she's managed to live
here in the united states for

287
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,600
the past five years while part
of a terrorist cell undetected.

288
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:58,565
Yes.

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,415
She's an expert at deception.

290
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,182
As long as she doesn't deceive us.

291
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,254
Right now, this is our best and
only chance at finding Marwan.

292
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,397
But no matter how well
we fabricate this story,

293
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,720
Jack will be in extreme
and immediate danger.

294
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,556
We have to be able to move in
at the first sign of trouble.

295
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:16,113
There is zero tolerance for error.

296
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,193
Thank you.

297
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,562
Good luck, everyone.

298
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,023
Curtis...

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,400
the detainees from McLennan-Forster
have been taken over to division.

300
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,020
I want you to run the interrogation.

301
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:30,651
You got it.

302
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,728
Thank you.

303
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,598
Edgar...

304
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,765
I want you to call LAPD and Caltrans.

305
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,721
We need their logs to reflect
that the ambush on Jack took place.

306
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,263
I need an exact time window.

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,507
He just finished telling us.

308
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,313
An hour ago.

309
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,165
I know.

310
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,272
I just didn't know if there
was an updated scenario.

311
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,706
No, Edgar, you weren't paying attention.

312
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,478
Look, we can't afford for you to be losing
focus at a time like this, all right?

313
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,027
I'm sick of people talking to me
like I don't know what I'm doing.

314
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,270
Especially people who
don't really work here.

315
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,783
Is there a problem with Edgar?

316
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,962
Well, his mother was caught in the

317
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:09,449
contamination zone at
the San Gabriel Reactor.

318
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,285
She took her own life.

319
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,367
Now up till now he's been
handling it pretty

320
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,648
well, but I think it may
be catching up with him.

321
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,972
Do you think he's in good enough shape
to run the comm part of this operation?

322
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,982
Based on what just happened?

323
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,632
No.

324
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,030
Where's Chloe?

325
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,692
I didn't see her on the active roster.

326
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:28,500
Driscoll forced her to resign.

327
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:29,502
Why?

328
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,526
Well, apparently, Chloe went
against Driscoll's orders,

329
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,190
sided with Jack.

330
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,704
Turns out, Jack was right.

331
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,857
Thank you.

332
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,112
Hello?

333
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,432
Chloe, it's Michelle Dessler.

334
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,109
You're calling me from division?

335
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,127
Actually, I'm back at CTU.

336
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:04,717
Secretary Heller asked me to
take Erin Driscoll's place.

337
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,012
She got fired?

338
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,253
That's too bad.

339
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,700
Listen, could you tell Edgar to upgrade
the langley pattern recognition software?

340
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,370
He gets a little overwhelmed sometimes.

341
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,005
Yeah, I'll make sure he takes care of that.

342
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:14,975
Thanks.

343
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,758
Listen, Chloe,

344
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,415
you're better at what you do
than anyone I've ever worked with.

345
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,951
I need you here.

346
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,358
Thank you for saying that, but I
think I've had enough for today.

347
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,271
Chloe, this would be for Jack.

348
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:29,596
not just for CTU

349
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:31,818
What are you talking about?

350
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,865
He's about to go undercover
in a high-risk operation.

351
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,540
We need to mount a massive
surveillance in very little time.

352
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,846
I don't have confidence that
Edgar can do this on his own.

353
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,956
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

354
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:43,882
Chloe...

355
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,056
I just need a few hours of your
time, and then you can move on.

356
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,720
I just want to do everything
I can to ensure Jack's safety.

357
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,765
Fine.

358
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,348
But it's just for today.

359
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,112
Thank you, Chloe.

360
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,134
You're welcome.

361
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,648
They're setting cars up at the ambush
site in case Marwan wants to verify.

362
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,716
We're using the dead bodies of
terrorists from Heller's rescue.

363
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,865
All right, the follow team
will stay as close as they can,

364
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,066
but to tell you the truth, Jack,

365
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,766
you're flying without a net on this one.

366
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,329
If a hostile decides to
take you out without warning,

367
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,194
there's nothing we can do.

368
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:20,800
I know.

369
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,655
Look, Audrey's still at the clinic.

370
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,417
There's time if you want to say good-bye.

371
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,833
She's got a lot on her mind right now.

372
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,747
Jack, she should know
what you're about to do.

373
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,605
She's been through enough today.

374
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,427
Want you to look over the time line,

375
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:55,116
then we'll talk through the details.

376
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,627
I'm not doing anything until I see my son.

377
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,960
We don't have time for that right now.

378
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,900
Seeing my son is non-negotiable.

379
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,200
Tony.

380
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,800
You need to learn every aspect of the
cover story- your life depends on it.

381
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,900
Don't worry about me.

382
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,500
You can see your son,
but only for a minute.

383
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,500
That's all.

384
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,800
Let's go.

385
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,100
Mom...

386
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
they wouldn't tell me where you were,
or even if I was going to see you again.

387
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,100
We're going to be together.

388
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
What are you talking about?

389
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,800
They wouldn't let you come with me.

390
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:06,265
Everything has changed.

391
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,000
I agreed to do something for them,
and they'll let me go with you.

392
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
What do they want you to do?

393
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,400
Help them find Marwan.

394
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
He's too dangerous.

395
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,300
Oh, I can handle Marwan.

396
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Please, mom...

397
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,800
no.

398
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,100
Don't worry.

399
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,900
I'll be fine.

400
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,900
Please, mom.

401
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,200
Mrs. Araz, it's time.

402
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,900
is field surveillance in place yet?

403
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
We have audio.

404
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
There might be some dead spots, but we
should be able to hear inside the house.

405
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
That's assuming they get that far.

406
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay, thank you

407
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:13,600
Yeah.

408
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,400
Come on, come on.

409
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
Why aren't you going through?

410
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,865
Damn it!

411
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,865
Use a danziger filter.

412
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,300
You can download it internally
if you know what you're doing.

413
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
There, you're in.

414
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Chloe, what are you doing here?

415
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,300
Michelle thought you could use some help.

416
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:29,000
Offload your task list at station 12.

417
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:29,800
I'll cover your overflow.

418
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,300
I can handle my assignment.

419
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,965
Well, obviously you can'T.

420
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
Otherwise Michelle
wouldn't have called me in.

421
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,500
Edgar, I meant to tell
you before Chloe got here.

422
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:38,317
Look, ms. Dessler.

423
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:39,065
I can do my job.

424
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,565
I don't need any help.

425
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm not saying you can't, but
I'm not taking any chances either.

426
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:44,200
Look, I realize we got off
to a rocky start, but...

427
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,200
Edgar, this isn't a debate.

428
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:47,100
It's an order.

429
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,400
Now, brief Chloe so she can run
satellite with you, and do it fast.

430
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,400
Jack's approaching the staging area.

431
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,500
This is Baron.

432
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
This is Dessler, we're set on our end.

433
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Satellite and surveillance
teams are in place.

434
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,400
Go in at your discretion.

435
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,265
Roger that.

436
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,200
We'll leave this line open.

437
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,200
We're going in alone?

438
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Our agents are conducting audio
surveillance with mobile parabolics.

439
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,000
What does that mean?

440
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
Acknowledge that you hear me.

441
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,300
Copy that.

442
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
What are you doing?

443
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,900
I have to make it look like I
was injured during the attack.

444
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Take my gun.

445
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,600
This has to look as convincing as possible.

446
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:16,600
Take my gun.

447
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,200
You must know that I want to kill you.

448
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
Yes.

449
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
But I know you won't because of Behrooz.

450
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,400
Let's go.

451
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,700
They're going in.

452
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,900
We're standing by.

453
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,300
What if Fayed doesn't believe us?

454
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,000
Then we're both dead.

455
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,300
Who is it?

456
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Joseph, it's Dina Araz.

457
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Who?

458
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,700
Dina Araz.

459
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:23,565
I'm a friend.

460
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,700
My husband is Navi.

461
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:25,800
He's been killed.

462
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

463
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,165
Now please go away.

464
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I need to speak to Marwan.

465
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I don't know any Marwan.

466
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:33,800
Yes, you do.

467
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,365
Go away before I call the police.

468
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,600
You won't call the police,
and we both know why.

469
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,000
What do you want?

470
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,800
I have a hostage.

471
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,100
Someone Marwan will want.

472
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,800
His name is Jack Bauer.

473
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,400
He's a CTU agent.

474
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,700
Now please, let me in
before someone sees me.

475
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,065
Close the door!

476
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,500
Put your gun over there!

477
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:04,400
Do it!

478
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
How did you find me?

479
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,465
My husband told me.

480
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,900
I don't know your husband.

481
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:30,900
He knew you.

482
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,700
Tell me what happened.

483
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,375
My husband was killed and I was arrested.

484
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,700
They were transporting me to CTU.

485
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,900
I heard an explosion, and the
van we were driving crashed.

486
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,500
It was our people...

487
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,500
they came to rescue me.

488
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,365
Everyone fell except Bauer and me.

489
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,500
He was wounded, and I
managed to get his gun.

490
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Where did this happen?

491
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,300
At the intersection of
sepulveda and national.

492
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Half a mile from here.

493
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Don't move.

494
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,300
What is it?

495
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
The is Fayed.

496
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,700
A woman named Dina Araz came to me.

497
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,300
How did she find you?

498
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,300
She claims her husband told her.

499
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,500
What does she want?

500
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,300
She wants to bring you a hostage.

501
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:26,000
A CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

502
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Jack Bauer?

503
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,100
Can you break into the other
side of the conversation?

504
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,000
No. The call's being piped
through a satellite switcher.

505
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:37,300
The signal's scrambled.

506
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,005
As she was being transported
our people ambushed the

507
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:42,500
vehicle at the intersection
of sepulveda and national.

508
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,100
Everyone was killed, but she
managed to escape with Bauer.

509
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,700
What do you want me to do?

510
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Bring them to me.

511
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,700
I will call you back in five
minutes with the details.

512
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:55,800
Be ready.

513
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,600
Do you understand?

514
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,200
Yes.

515
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I understand.

516
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,800
Marwan wants to see him.

517
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Baron, it's a go.

518
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,365
I heard.

519
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,500
Set a follow grid, and we'll
coordinate from our end.

520
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,400
Evening, sir.

521
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,700
Evening.

522
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
Pop the trunk for me, sir.

523
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Since when are you searching
officer's cars at the gate, sergeant?

524
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,900
An elevated threat level.

525
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,200
Okay, you're good to go, sir.

526
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:44,900
Thank you.

527
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm on base.

528
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,600
Continue to the next phase.

529
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,750
Okay, I got you on base.

530
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:28,665
Let me talk to my family.

531
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,129
- Open the trunk, captain.
- Let me talk to my wife.

532
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,500
I said open the trunk.

533
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,700
Please...

534
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,329
let me talk to my family.

535
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:37,858
Your family is dead...

536
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:39,100
And so are you.

537
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,465
Mrs. Raines, your husband sustained
bullet wounds to his chest and abdomen.

538
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,256
Now, we were able to extract
one of the bullets, but I' called

539
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:40,100
a neurosurgeon in from Cedars to
help extract the second bullet.

540
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,700
Why a neurosurgeon?

541
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,472
Well, the bullet is lodged
against his t-5 vertebrae and

542
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:48,700
we want to be careful to avoid
any further spinal trauma.

543
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,400
I can't believe this is happening.

544
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,500
I'll let you know as soon as I
get any news on his condition.

545
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,200
Thank you.

546
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,700
Dad...

547
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't think I realized how
much I cared for Paul until now.

548
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,600
I know this is terrible timing, but the
president has called and I have to leave.

549
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,900
You'll be able to reach me on my number.

550
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,100
The doctors will keep me up to speed here.

551
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Okay.

552
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
I love you, Audrey.

553
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,000
And I'm proud to be your dad.

554
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,200
I love you, too.

555
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,700
Be careful.

556
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,400
Where are you taking me?

557
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:18,000
Shut up!

558
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,800
How far are we going?

559
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,900
It won't be long.

560
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,200
You look nervous.

561
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,200
What do you expect?

562
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,400
I wouldn't have contacted
you if I felt I had a choice.

563
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,800
And as a result, I have no choice.

564
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,400
We do whatever we have to for the cause.

565
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:51,100
So what's the problem?

566
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,600
There is no problem.

567
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,600
He's approaching an intersection.

568
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,167
They're turning off olympic.

569
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,700
Moving to next sub-channel.

570
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,900
He's turning onto a side street.

571
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Collier avenue.

572
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,400
Hold that distance.

573
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,500
Understood.

574
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,300
He's heading towards
the broad street tunnel.

575
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,400
He's slowing down.

576
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,500
Baron, drop back.

577
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,300
Can't afford to have them spot the tail.

578
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:23,200
We're backing off.

579
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,300
He's turning into the tunnel.

580
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,100
Maintain your distance.

581
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,500
He's too far ahead for the parabolic.

582
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,500
I couldn't be able to hear
what's going on in there.

583
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:39,165
The tunnel's 400 yards long.

584
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,300
They'll be out of satellite view
for approximately 20 seconds.

585
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,500
Pull in front of this truck.

586
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,300
What's going on?

587
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,565
Out of the car!

588
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,100
What are you doing?!

589
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,300
From Marwan.

590
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:16,600
Yes.

591
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,300
This is taking too long.

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
We got them. They're out of the tunnel.

593
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:42,500
Do you have a visual?

594
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,700
That's it.

595
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,800
We've got them up ahead.

596
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,600
Fayed's turning onto Napier.

597
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,300
Napier loops back around to olympic.

598
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,100
That means he just spent the last
five minutes driving in a circle.

599
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,800
Maybe he's trying to detect surveillance.

600
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,500
Chloe, can you switch to infrared?

601
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,300
Hold on.

602
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,300
There's only one person in the car!

603
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,600
They made a switch in the tunnel!

604
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,900
Baron, the covert part
of the operation is over.

605
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,800
All teams move in on the target car.

606
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Alpha team, cut him off at
the bridge. We're right behind.

607
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:18,800
Establish a perimeter around the area.

608
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:20,565
Stop and search all vehicles.

609
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,565
Chloe, do you have anything on satellite?

610
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,750
Nothing around the immediate
area of the target's car.

611
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:25,900
Can you go back into archives
and find out what happened?

612
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,500
Yeah, it's going to take a few minutes.

613
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,365
Do it.

614
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Baron, what's your status?

615
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,900
Closing in now.

616
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,800
We got him surrounded on the bridge.

617
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,370
Passenger side

618
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,378
On your left

619
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,283
Flank him.

620
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,400
Get out of the car and
put your hands up now!

621
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:53,600
Out of the car!

622
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,100
Bomb!

623
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Oh, my god.

624
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,200
Marwan set us up.

625
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,365
Almeida.

626
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,000
Agent Baron's dead.

627
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:43,165
So is Fayed.

628
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,400
Is there any sign of Jack?

629
00:37:44,435 --> 00:37:44,765
No, not yet.

630
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,300
Any other hostiles in the area?

631
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:47,700
The area looks secure.

632
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,465
Okay.

633
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,300
I'll get you another back
up team as soon as I can.

634
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,900
I've the archives satellite footage.

635
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:53,800
Play it back..

636
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,200
Okay, during the time Fayed's car is
in the tunnel, three vehicles exit.

637
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,200
Check the van.

638
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,600
Can you get me a license number on that?

639
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
Not from the satellite. Let
me check the traffic cameras.

640
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,000
Edgar, get me the caltrans interface.

641
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,900
We have a socket open.

642
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:09,700
Logging in.

643
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,400
Done.

644
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,100
Okay, there's a camera at
the entrance to the tunnel.

645
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,600
Looking for the right frame.

646
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,300
Got it.

647
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,765
Send this out to all the field teams.

648
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
I want interagency support
on setting up the grid.

649
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm on it.

650
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,830
We have an ID on the
vehicle: White chevy van, late

651
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:44,700
'90s, license plate charlie
victor alpha, three-two-two.

652
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,000
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

653
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,300
I'm sorry for your loss, Dina.

654
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,000
Navi was a great man.

655
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I hope my men weren't too rough with you.

656
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,000
It was necessary, in case
you were under surveillance.

657
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,800
I understand.

658
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
But we weren't followed, I was careful.

659
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,600
You're a good liar, Dina.

660
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,965
What?

661
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,965
Fayed martyred himself.

662
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,300
The men who were following you are dead.

663
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,165
What men?

664
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,900
Enough with the lies!

665
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,300
Marwan, please believe me.

666
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I did not betray you.

667
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,900
Prove it to me.

668
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,600
Kill him.

669
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,100
Just what I thought.

670
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,900
Get him out of here.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
