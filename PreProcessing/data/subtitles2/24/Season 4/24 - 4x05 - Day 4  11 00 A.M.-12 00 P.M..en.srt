1
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,996
I'm the Secretary of Defense
of the United States of America!

2
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:17,827
You will listen to me!

3
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,253
Put down your weapon.

4
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:32,545
If another one of my men dies,
your daughter will be killed.

5
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:33,612
We need to get out of here.

6
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,611
What?

7
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:35,610
You're in danger.

8
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:36,709
From who?

9
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:37,875
Don't ask questions,
just come with me.

10
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,372
Please, help me!

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,602
<i>( choking )</i>

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,303
Debbie, what's wrong?

13
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:43,537
<i>( coughing )</i>

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,066
What did you do to her?

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:51,762
<i>( phone rings )</i>

16
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:52,993
O'Brian.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,659
The satellite up yet?

18
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,390
No, I have to reposition
without Driscoll noticing.

19
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,588
Where are you?

20
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,254
<i>I'm at a Mercury Martin
in Solmas.</i>

21
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,219
<i>I had to stage a robbery
to keep the hostile in place.</i>

22
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:05,482
Tell those officers to put
their guns down and stand back!

23
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:06,847
Edgar, I need you to help me.

24
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:08,013
Help you with what?

25
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,511
I've been in contact
with Jack Bauer.

26
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:10,676
What?

27
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,109
That's right.
Now you're involved,

28
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,207
so you're either
going to help me,

29
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,139
or you're going
to turn me in.

30
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,371
You're asking me to do something

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,437
that can get me fired.

32
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:17,436
I know you were working

33
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:18,501
with her
behind Driscoll's back.

34
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:19,635
What do you want?

35
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:20,934
I want to make sure

36
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,498
I have your attention
whenever I need it.

37
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,929
Chloe, why are you
logged on

38
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:27,159
to an active DOD satellite?

39
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:28,094
All right,
you're done here.

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,458
I was going
to quit anyway.

41
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,022
I want you
to call Jack Bauer now.

42
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,855
Driscoll wants
to talk to you.

43
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:35,785
Stand down, Jack. It's over.

44
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:37,250
Erin, right now Hasan is free.

45
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:38,916
He's looking for a car
and a phone.

46
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,447
Once he has those things,

47
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:43,012
he's going to lead us straight
to Secretary Heller, I promise.

48
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,207
Son of a bitch.

49
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,872
Get out of the car!

50
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:06,656
Do we still have
a SAT visual on Kalil Hasan?

51
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:07,888
He's west of the 14 on Route 11.

52
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,553
Average speed,
62 miles per hour.

53
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,251
All right, I want
traffic workups,

54
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,550
roadwork schedules.

55
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,050
We can't let anything
delay or prevent him

56
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:15,314
from reaching his destination.

57
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,913
We need the tactical teams
to launch now.

58
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,444
Keep them at Jack's location.

59
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,944
I'm coordinating
with Division.

60
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,441
Do you want me
to pre-emp that?

61
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,674
Yes, at one point.
All right.

62
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,872
Curtis, I can pull up
those tactical teams

63
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:25,937
for you if you want.

64
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,102
No, you can't.

65
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:28,368
That requires
a level-three channel.

66
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:31,832
You don't have that
kind of clearance.

67
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,063
Miss Driscoll?

68
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,296
I have a Sergeant Paulson

69
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,293
from the Sheriff's Department
on line one.

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,493
He says it's important.

71
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,418
Sergeant Paulson,

72
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,150
this is Erin Driscoll
at CTU.

73
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,081
How can I help you?

74
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:50,913
Yeah, I have a man named
Jack Bauer in custody,

75
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,913
He claims he works
with you. Is that true?

76
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,310
Yes, it is.

77
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,375
He just robbed a convenience
store near Route 11

78
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,873
and claims it was part

79
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,837
of some undercover
operation to delay a suspect

80
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:03,301
until satellite coverage
could be established.

81
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,065
That's also true, Sergeant.

82
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:06,266
Well, it might be nice

83
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,062
if you communicated
with us a little better.

84
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,661
Well, there were some national
security issues involved,

85
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,491
and I'm so sorry
for any inconvenience.

86
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,958
May I please speak to Mr. Bauer?

87
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,055
All right.

88
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,188
Uncuff him.

89
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,814
Thank you.

90
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:27,345
Tell me that you
didn't arrest Hasan.

91
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,910
No, he's still
in the vehicle

92
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:31,173
and we're still
tracking him by satellite.

93
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:32,240
We intercepted
a phone call

94
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,671
that indicated he's headed
for the site

95
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:34,770
where Secretary Heller's
being held.

96
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:35,937
You're going
to need someone

97
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:36,803
coordinating things
on the ground.

98
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:37,802
That should be me.

99
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:38,967
Erin, listen to me.

100
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,465
We can get Heller
and Audrey out of there,

101
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:41,464
but we need
to work together

102
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,864
and we need
to start that now.

103
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,159
We have to find Heller
before this trial starts.

104
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,524
It's the right move, Erin.

105
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,655
He's our only option.

106
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,651
All right, you're in,

107
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,450
but you coordinate
through me.

108
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,114
And, Jack,
make this work.

109
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,680
I will.

110
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:02,845
Please advise Sergeant Paulson
of the new chain of command.

111
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,043
Yeah?

112
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,406
In my capacity
as Director of CTU,

113
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,970
I'm vesting Jack Bauer
with the authority to command

114
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:10,837
and control this part
of the ground operation.

115
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:12,434
Consider him in charge.

116
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,533
Yes, ma'am.

117
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,666
Thank you.

118
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:16,863
Sounds like you're
the new boss.

119
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,162
Tell me what you need.

120
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:19,562
The vehicle the hostile
was driving was stolen.

121
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,893
I need to make sure
there's no APB on it.

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,059
If there is one,

123
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,923
I need you to get CHP
to cancel it.

124
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,122
I also left
my CTU vehicle

125
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:27,420
over at the convenience mart.

126
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:28,486
I'll have it brought
right over.

127
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:29,552
Thank you.

128
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,847
Why don't you go
get that car?

129
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,267
Hasan's making
another phone call.

130
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,431
Bring it up, patch it
through to Jack.

131
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:54,028
<i>( phone rings )</i>

132
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:56,825
Bauer.

133
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:58,057
Jack, it's Edgar Stiles.

134
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,054
Hasan's making
another phone call.

135
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,487
I'm patching it to you.

136
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:02,520
Okay.

137
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:03,518
Yes?

138
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:06,316
It's Kalil. I'm on my way.

139
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:07,648
How much longer?

140
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:10,178
About a half an hour.

141
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,344
The broadcast
must begin on time.

142
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,674
Any problems?

143
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,339
Nothing I couldn't handle.

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,532
How are you coming
with the servers?

145
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,233
Dumar and Farez
are managing,

146
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,607
but I'm sure
they could use your help.

147
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,165
I'll be there soon.

148
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,231
All right.

149
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:27,762
Did Heller sign the confession?

150
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,395
Yes.

151
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,357
He didn't want to,
but we used his daughter.

152
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:35,188
Did you kill her?

153
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,418
Not yet.

154
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,450
Sergeant Paulson?

155
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:40,816
What's the E.T.A.
on my vehicle?

156
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,314
Any second, Agent Bauer.

157
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,912
I'll see you soon.

158
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,875
I want to hear it again.

159
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,141
Play it back.

160
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:53,337
Okay, Jack, one second.
Let me play it back.

161
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,535
Tell your men
to stay on channel three.

162
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,266
Got it.

163
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:59,631
Any problems?

164
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,364
HASAN:
Nothing I couldn't handle.

165
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,193
How are you coming
with the servers?

166
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,608
Dad?

167
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,672
You did what anyone else
would have done

168
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,804
in your position.

169
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,336
I embarrassed my country.

170
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,332
You signed
a piece of paper;

171
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,197
all lies.

172
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,163
Everyone will know that you
signed it under duress.

173
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:40,792
It's more than a piece of paper.

174
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,656
This trial is going
to be a spectacle,

175
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:44,755
broadcast all over the world,

176
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,885
designed to humiliate
and degrade this country.

177
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,482
Dad...

178
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:53,479
there's still time.

179
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:56,044
There's no sense
in deluding ourselves.

180
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,542
There's less than an hour.

181
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,205
If we're going
to do anything,

182
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,569
we have to do it now.

183
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:07,831
We've done everything
that we can.

184
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:10,264
Not quite.

185
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,462
What do you mean?

186
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:17,023
What if I'm not alive?

187
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:18,555
They can't put me on trial.

188
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:21,984
If I'm dead, their goals
go right out the window.

189
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:25,715
And they'll be viewed as nothing
more than common assassins.

190
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,747
Dad...

191
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,778
Listen to me.

192
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:31,243
Even if I say
what they want me to say,

193
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,874
they're not going to let me go.

194
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:36,071
They're going to put me in front
of a camera, humiliate me,

195
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:38,203
and then they're
going to kill me

196
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,268
with the whole world watching.

197
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,498
There are people
on the outside looking for us.

198
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,829
You cannot give up.

199
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,261
I have to do something
while I still can.

200
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,123
And I need you
to help me.

201
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,219
Help you?

202
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:58,717
The chain between
your handcuffs,

203
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,148
see if you can get it
up and around my neck.

204
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:01,846
No, no.

205
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:03,578
I can't do it myself!

206
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:04,578
I don't have
any leverage.

207
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:05,577
No.

208
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:07,641
But you can pull
from back there!

209
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:08,806
Dad...

210
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:10,273
I'm counting on you
to help me!

211
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,437
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

212
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,900
At least try it!

213
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:16,199
<i>( sobbing ):
I won't do it.</i>

214
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,662
I won't do it, Dad.

215
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:31,885
I'm sorry.

216
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,909
There's a gas pipe.

217
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,337
If we could break it...

218
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,336
No.

219
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:50,201
Break that, you die, too.

220
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,032
Do you think
that they are going

221
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,529
to let me out
of here alive?

222
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:57,726
Do you?

223
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,991
They're going
to kill me, too.

224
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,783
Dad...

225
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,107
Together we can do this.
We can do it,

226
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,138
okay?

227
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:29,263
Please.

228
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,060
Let's try it.

229
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,551
We're almost there.

230
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:45,046
Okay, that's good.

231
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,332
You ready?

232
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:02,464
Yeah.

233
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,428
<i>( grunts )</i>

234
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,224

00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:11,456
<i>( gas hissing )</i>

236
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:18,015
I love you.

237
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,714
I love you, too, honey.

238
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,670
I want a full analysis
on both these voices.

239
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,736
Okay. I'll have it
done in ten minutes.

240
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:40,901
Thank you.

241
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:46,300
Edgar.

242
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:47,301
What, Maryanne?

243
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:48,700
What's a level-
three channel?

244
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,668
It's a logon that gets you
into all the systems,

245
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,066
tactical, district and division.

246
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,199
I want it.

247
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,099
What do you mean?

248
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:57,533
I want clearance
for a level-three channel.

249
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,365
I can't give it to you.
Only Driscoll

250
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,664
can authorize that.

251
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,196
I don't care who authorizes it.
I want it.

252
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:09,596
Look, just because
you overheard that conversation

253
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:12,229
between Chloe and me, it
doesn't mean I'm your bitch.

254
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,961
<i>( telephone rings )</i>

255
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,727
I'm done being scared of you.

256
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,659
<i>( phone rings )</i>

257
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,192
Miss Driscoll,
it's Maryanne.

258
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:29,991
Yes, Maryanne, what is it?

259
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,858
I've some further information
for you

260
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,524
regarding Chloe's
circumventing your authority.

261
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,823
I'm listening.

262
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,122
I don't think
she was acting alone.

263
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,089
Who was she working with?

264
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,788
I'm not sure, but I found an
electronic echo in her call log,

265
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:49,355
and every time
she spoke to Jack,

266
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:51,188
there was someone else
on the line, too.

267
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,553
That's an automated
behavior on our system.

268
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,820
Doesn't mean anyone
else was on the line.

269
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:57,018
Is that the extent

270
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,720
of your suspicion?

271
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,785
Yes, I'm, uh, I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

272
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:06,883
You're sick.

273
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,450
You're going to go
to Driscoll and you're

274
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,383
going to tell her you're
overloaded and you need help,

275
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,716
and you're going to ask her

276
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,649
to issue me a level-three
channel clearance.

277
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,111
Unit Three,
this is Bauer, do you copy?

278
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:34,378
Copy.

279
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,678
Back off another 200 yards.

280
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,379
We can't afford
to be spotted here.

281
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:38,377
Roger that.

282
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,377
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

283
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:40,377
Yeah?

284
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,644
The marines have assembled

285
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:42,975
and are leaving base.

286
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:44,842
Okay, have Chloe
collate the satellite images.

287
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,142
Make sure they stay in sync.

288
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,808
Chloe's in a holding room, Jack.

289
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:48,941
She's been suspended.

290
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,507
We could use her help here.

291
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,908
Things are
under control.

292
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,508
I'll have Curtis
collate the images.

293
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,640
Erin, Chloe was just
doing what I asked her to.

294
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,839
The point is, she was supposed
to be working for me.

295
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:58,907
I understand
that, but...

296
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,838
Jack, it's one thing for you

297
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,739
to disobey me in the field,

298
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:06,571
but for someone who works
for me here at CTU to betray me?

299
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,738
I can't reactivate her.

300
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:09,070
It's a non-starter.

301
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,303
Anything else?

302
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:13,670
No, nothing else.

303
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:35,098
We have a situation here.

304
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,298
I realize that.

305
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,998
I can do the math
as well as anyone.

306
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:39,597
The math?

307
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:40,996
Protocols were violated.

308
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:42,862
Someone has to take the bullet.

309
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,430
Jack's indispensable
right now and I'm not.

310
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:47,462
It took a lot of guts

311
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,796
for you to do what you did.

312
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,594
I trusted Jack.

313
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,330
A lot of people
around here trust Jack.

314
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:55,193
Doesn't mean they're going
to risk their careers for him.

315
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,226
I have a suggestion.

316
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:04,193
I'm going to leave
this room, call Admin.

317
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,625
They'll fax over
some resignation papers,

318
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:07,891
and you sign them.

319
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,491
And then what?

320
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,022
And then nothing.

321
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:14,823
I walk out?

322
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,356
You walk out.

323
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,821
No jail, no sanctions?

324
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:21,656
That's right.

325
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:25,288
Although, if you need
a letter of recommendation

326
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,653
for your next job,

327
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,887
you probably should
get it from Jack, not me.

328
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,519
Right.

329
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,719
Sound like a plan?

330
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:34,753
Yes.

331

She didn't
know anything.

You didn't
have to kill her.

334
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:57,648
Yes, I did,

335
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:00,012
because you didn't have the
courage to kill her yourself.

336
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,515
Courage?

337
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,913
To poison a girl
who did no harm to you at all?

than by the fact
that you were spying on me.

Well, within the time

It is imperative

477

that that driver not be detained
any longer.

way as soon as possible.

00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,231
<i>( phone rings )</i>

496
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:40,333
Finish the setup
and let's do a test.

497
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,802
Yes?

498
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,103
We may have a problem.

499
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,636
I'm listening.

500
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:49,640
The police just ran the plates
of the vehicle I'm driving.

501
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:50,941
And?

502
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,375
They let me go.

503
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,909
Jack, are you getting this?

504
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:54,945
Yeah.

505
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:55,911
OMAR:
So what is the problem?

506
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,277
This is a stolen car.

507
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:59,748
Maybe the owner
hasn't reported it yet?

508
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:01,315
Or maybe
I'm getting help

509
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,384
from people who want
to make sure

510
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:04,852
I get where I'm going.

511
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,287
Do not jump
to conclusions.

512
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:10,656
A police officer was approaching
me, his hand on his gun.

513
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:13,325
Then he got a call,
suddenly there's no problem.

514
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:20,166
<i>( sighs )</i>

515
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,732
We can't take any chances.

516
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,867
I'm moving in.

517
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:23,867
He's not going
to lead us to the site.

518
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:24,967
The best we can do
right now

519
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,369
is try to take him
alive and break him.

520
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,238
All units, move in.

521
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:29,604
I repeat, move in.

522
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,844
Okay, I've got a visual.

523
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,979
Set up a roadblock
at mile marker 15.

524
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,749
It has been an honor
working with you, Omar.

525
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:47,652
The honor
has been mine, Kalil.

526
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:50,189
Come on.

527
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:56,493
<i>Allah Akbar.</i>

00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,080
No!

530
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,455
Oh, God.

531
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,525
He just drove head-on
into another vehicle.

532
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:36,758
He was our only lead.

533
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:04,095
We're going to switch gears
since we've lost our only lead.

534
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:08,731
Kalil Hasan committed suicide
en route to Heller's location.

535
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:09,832
Have they recovered
anything on him

536
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,502
that might help identify
where Heller is?

537
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:12,936
It's too soon to tell.

538
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:14,770
They're still putting out
the fire from the crash.

539
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:15,872
How much time
do we have

540
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,705
before this trial begins
to broadcast?

541
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:19,142
Some time in the next,
ten, 15 minutes.

542
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,443
<i>( phone rings )</i>

543
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,844
Sarah Gavin.

544
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,012
It's Jack.

545
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,813
Put him on speaker.

546
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,748
GAVIN: Go ahead, Jack,
you're on speaker.

547
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:28,148
I'm sifting
through the wreckage now,

548
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,584
but there's not much intact.

549
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:31,886
Hasan said he was 30 minutes
from his destination.

550
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:33,221
It's 20 minutes
before he stopped.

551
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:34,322
Do we have
a maximum perimeter?

552
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,023
Edgar?

553
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,091
We're looking at a radius of
60 miles centered at Acton.

554
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,661
We're dispatching choppers
and fixed-wing crafts

555
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:41,694
to survey the area.

556
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,097
No, that's going
to take too long.

557
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,931
Use the satellites.
Conduct a thermal scan.

558
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,265
It won't work.
Why not?

559
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,600
That area has
a high concentration

560
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,899
of electric power transmitters.

561
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,603
The satellite won't
be able to distinguish

562
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,003
between them and the servers.

563
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,605
Those transmitters
have been in place for years.

564
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,006
If we take a scan,

565
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,376
we can lay it against
the previous grid pattern.

566
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,376
That way we can identify
any new thermal activity.

567
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:00,212
We can start the scan
immediately.

568
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,280
Do it.

569
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,515
Jack?

570
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:04,715
We're using a satellite
to check the thermals.

571
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,050
Keep the line open.

572
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,150
Hurry.

573
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,386
Miss Driscoll?
The clinic wanted me

574
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:10,955
to tell you that
your daughter has arrived.

575
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:12,423
Thank you.

576
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,359
All right, everyone reset
your systems.

577
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:17,260
Let's get back on track.

578
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,895
I have to take care
of something

579
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:19,963
for a few minutes.

580
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:21,598
Would you check in
with Division?

581
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,066
They're expecting
an update.

582
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,366
Everything okay?

583
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:26,168
Yeah, just a little problem
with my daughter, Maya.

584
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:27,603
I had to bring her
down to the clinic.

585
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:28,635
Is she okay?

586
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:30,105
She's fine.
Call Division.

587
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,850
What are you
working on?

588
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,918
Personnel allocation tables
and tactical generals

589
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,285
for the assault teams.

590
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:48,787
I notice every time I look over,
you're talking to Edgar.

591
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:52,091
What's that all about?

592
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:54,629
I'm just trying
to learn the ropes, Curtis.

593
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,431
Today is not the day

594
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:01,866
to make career moves
on people, Maryanne.

595
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,468
The only thing you
should be thinking about

596
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:06,205
is how to help us stop Heller
from being publicly executed.

597
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:07,905
Come on, Curtis.
Give me some credit.

598
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:09,072
Save it.

599
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,641
I know how you think.

600
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:14,678
Just leave everybody alone
and help us get through today.

601
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,986
Mark?
Hmm?

602
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,588
Thank you so much
for helping me out.

603
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:26,722
They said Maya's arrived?

604
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:28,157
She's in the exam area.

605
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,594
We're about
to do a workup.

606
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,994
She's been
on Thorazine.

607
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,995
She stopped taking it.

608
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,198
How long ago?

609
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:36,498
Based on what
happened this morning,

610
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:37,933
at least a few days.

611
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,167
What happened?

612
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,035
She's fixated on one
of my neighbor's kids.

613
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:42,102
What does she do?

614
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:43,170
She walks
into the yard,

615
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:44,971
gets verbally abusive.

616
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,440
I'll take good care of her.

617
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:47,508
Thank you.

618
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:48,742
Sure.

619
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,080
Maya?

620
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:57,317
Mom, I'm so happy
to see you.

621
00:29:57,384 --> 00:29:59,285
I was going crazy
at home.

622
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:00,520
What happened
with Evan?

623
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:01,887
Why did you go
over there?

624
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,222
I know you
said not to,

625
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:08,627
but he was throwing things
against the fence.

626
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:10,229
Maya,

627
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:12,530
he plays with a ball.

628
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:13,797
He's seven years old,
sweetheart.

629
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:14,864
I don't care
how old he is.

630
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:17,636
He should know better.

631
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:21,138
Are you going to talk
to his dad about this?

632
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:22,806
Come here.

633
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:29,245
Look at me.

634
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:31,881
Mm-hmm.

635
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:33,916
You're not thinking
clearly, honey.

636
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:36,218
You've got to put it
out of your mind.

637
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,221
Dr. Calis is going
to help and you're going

638
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,857
to feel better
very soon.

639
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,358
Why don't we go home
right now?

640
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:44,625
We can't, honey.

641
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:46,793
Why not?

642
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:51,198
There's a little trouble
here in L.A.

643
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,668
and I have
to take care of it.

644
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:54,967
Are you going
to be okay?

645
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:57,537
Yes, I'm going
to be okay.

646
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,674
And you're going
to be okay.

647
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:02,441
I love you so much.

648
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:06,812
I love you,
too, honey.

649
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,181
Shh...

650
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,653
Shh.

651
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,689
It's okay. It's okay.

652
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:19,556
Yes?

653
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:20,990
OMAR:
Kalil is dead.

654
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:23,527
Dead? How?

655
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:25,663
He was being followed here.

656
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:26,829
He martyred himself

657
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:29,865
without hesitation.

658
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,035
What about the servers?

659
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:32,068
Have they been
re-conformed

660
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:33,136
for the broadcast?

661
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:34,436
Dumar is doing his best.

662
00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:36,506
I think we'll
be all right.

663
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,173
If you need help,
I can come.

664
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,444
No, no, no.
It is too risky.

665
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:42,879
If the servers don't work
correctly,

666
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,880
we're in trouble.

667
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,448
This trial
is only the beginning.

668
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:48,616
I know that as well as you,
my friend.

669
00:31:48,684 --> 00:31:51,719
But there's no need
to worry.

670
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,454
Everything will go
as planned.

671
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,124
You checked out
the package?

672
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,258
It's fine.

673
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:01,226
I was afraid it might
be damaged

674
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,428
in the train crash.

675
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:05,633
The case is very strong.
There's no problem.

676
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,632
Good.

677
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,833
Then you can
get started.

678
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,542
Gas.

679
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:18,310
I smell gas.

680
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:19,976
Heller.

Hurry, open the door!

Come on!

687
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:57,477
Do whatever it
takes to revive him!

<i>( coughing )</i>

689
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,904
I know him.

690
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,907
She recognized me.

691
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,442
She has to be killed.

692
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,476
She will,

693
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,378
in good time.

694
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:36,479
Go do your job.

695
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:38,681
Go.

696
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:45,888
Yeah?

697
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:46,788
DRISCOLL:
We got the results

698
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:47,824
from the thermal scan.

699
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,690
One site matches the criteria.

700
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,025
Where?

701
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:53,761
An old industrial park
around three miles from you.

702
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,363
Give me the exact address.

703
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:57,265
It's off a service road
south of Brach.

704
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:58,566
Okay, I'll set up
the staging area.

705
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,602
Where is the marine strike
force? 20 minutes away.

706
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:02,436
This trial starts
any minute, Jack.

707
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:04,704
I know. I'll get back to you
soon as I'm on site.

708
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:07,374
Meanwhile, have someone download
the schematics to the building.

709
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,575
Send them over to my screen.

710
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:09,644
Edgar's on it.

711
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,854
<i>( knocking )</i>

712
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:26,558
We'll take the rest
of these up later.

713
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:27,659
Yes, Mr. President.

714
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,528
What is it, Robert?

715
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,697
CTU thinks it's identified the
location where the terrorists

716
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,266
are holding Secretary Heller
and his daughter.

717
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:35,500
Where?

718
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,133
A compound
in the Santa Clarita Valley.

719
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,302
But there is a problem.

720
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,968
The team's dispatched
to the site

721
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,338
may not get there in time

722
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,241
to prevent the broadcast,
and even if they do,

723
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,575
there is a good chance the
Secretary will be killed

724
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:46,708
in any rescue attempt.

725
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:48,845
Well, we have no choice

726
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:52,415
but to hope and pray
that you're wrong.

727
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:54,649
We do have a choice.

728
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:57,252
The Secretary's death
would be tragic.

729
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:59,588
But his execution
on American soil,

730
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:01,722
broadcast to the world,
would be far worse.

731
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,760
It would be a complete and utter
humiliation for the country.

732
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:06,392
Perhaps the worst
in our history.

733
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:07,928
I'm well aware
of that, Robert.

734
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,595
But unless you have
some solution,

735
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,765
I'm missing the point
of this conversation.

736
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,368
The solution is,
we make a preemptive strike.

737
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:15,969
Assuming we locate the site

738
00:35:16,035 --> 00:35:17,203
in time,
we destroy it.

739
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,371
We kill our own
Secretary of Defense?

740
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:20,707
To prevent our enemies

741
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:23,241
from making a public spectacle
of his death.

742
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:25,177
He's going to be killed anyway.

743
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,787
Jim Heller is a good friend.

744
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:40,223
A loyal public servant.

745
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:44,729
You expect me
to kill him to save face?

746
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:47,632
Not yours, sir.

747
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:49,765
The country's.

748
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,200
If we look impotent
in this situation,

749
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,402
we'll only encourage
more attacks.

750
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,104
And if I may say so, sir,

751
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,606
having known Jim Heller
many years myself,

752
00:35:57,673 --> 00:36:01,110
if he were here, he'd be the
first to endorse this plan.

753
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:04,078
The public will never accept it.

754
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,281
All the public will know
is the Secretary died

755
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,149
during the course
of a rescue attempt,

756
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:09,383
which is certainly
more palatable

757
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,484
than letting him be executed

758
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,233
with the whole world watching.

our dermatologist's office.

00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,679
She missed her appointment

We haven't seen her

Oh, she left a message saying
she was on her way

792
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:53,406
to see Behrooz. There
must be a misunderstanding.

793
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,706
Perhaps she stopped off...

794
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,339
No, she wouldn't have stopped
off anywhere,

795
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:57,836
she knew she had
this appointment.

796
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,134
It'll take weeks
to reschedule and...

Is Behrooz here?

798

He is studying.

799

Well, maybe he knows
where she is?

800

I doubt it.

He hasn't left
his room all morning.

No, she downloaded
that ring specially.

Oh.

Do you know where she is?

her call me?

823
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,648
Oh, yes, of course.

824
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:06,613
I told you

825
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:07,781
not to interfere.

826
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,078
It was her phone.

827
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,178
I shut it off.

828
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:12,608
He took care of it, Navi.

829
00:39:12,676 --> 00:39:15,041
She went away because
she believed him.

830
00:39:15,107 --> 00:39:17,139
Let's hope so.

831
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,703
Get in the car.

832
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:21,834
Follow her.

833
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,933
Make sure she doesn't
go to the police.

834
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,132
All right.

835
00:39:46,914 --> 00:39:48,081
I'm less than two minutes out.

836
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:49,544
Have you worked up
the rescue approach?

837
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:51,746
We're running up scenarios now
based on the schematics.

838
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:54,277
Okay, what are the probabilities
of finding the Secretary

839
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:55,741
and his daughter
in the compound?

840
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:57,205
Our analysts have
looked at everything.

841
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:58,605
The data is fuzzy,
but our best guess

842
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:00,370
is that they're on the
west end of the building.

843
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,070
Together or separate?
We don't know that yet.

844
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:04,034
Okay, we're going to have
to activate a team split,

845
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,665
one for the Secretary,
one for his daughter.

846
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:08,298
We discussed that, Jack,
but it was rejected.

847
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,597
What are you talking about?

848
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:11,428
It comes directly
from the President.

849
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:12,761
Once we go in strong,

850
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,425
there'll be very little time
to secure the hostages.

851
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:15,792
Our only priority
is to get Heller.

852
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:16,990
Curtis that doesn't
make sense.

853
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,655
I don't like it any more
than you do, Jack,

854
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:21,386
but those are the orders.

855
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:23,986
Jack?

856
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:25,815
They're about to begin
the broadcast.

857
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,216
I'm almost there.

858
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,679
Damn it.

859
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:57,324
We are about to embark
on a process of justice,

860
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,657
that will forever
change the world.

861
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,853
Our people will
finally be liberated

862
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,450
from the tangle
of corruption

863
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:08,283
that has been choking them
for centuries.

864
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:10,114
No longer will justice be

865
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:12,411
the propagandist tool
of the power elite.

866
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:14,710
It will once again become
the instrument

867
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:16,075
of the people.

868
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:19,072
Delivered through
true believers,

869
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:23,037
whose courage to use the
sword has made this day

870
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:25,868
not only possible,
but inevitable.

871
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:27,333
Mr. President, I've
taken the liberty

872
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:29,931
of having a laser-guided missile
programmed and prepped.

873
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:32,229
All that remains is
for you to give the order.

874
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,328
...with the same conviction
and resolve...

875
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,828
How long between
my order and impact?

876
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,292
The fighter's in the air.

877
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:39,556
It needs to get in range,
no more than ten minutes.

878
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,422
...required to render judgment
fairly,

879
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:42,921
without prejudice,

880
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:46,684
or we will be judged
the same as our enemies.

881
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:49,882
As our prisoner shall be
judged today...

882
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,148
Do it.

883
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:52,547
Let Driscoll know.

884
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,278
...this nation will
also be judged.

885
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,212
Today is the day
the United States of America

886
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:59,742
shall be tested for
the final time

887
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:04,804
on your own soil,
before the eyes of the world.

888
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:11,531
Yes, I understand.

889
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,423
Jack, I have
Miss Driscoll for you.

890
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,688
DRISCOLL:
Jack, where are you?

891
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:24,920
I'm on site.

892
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:27,118
Jack, stand down.

893
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:29,352
What are you talking about?

894
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:30,981
The marines won't get
there on time.

895
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,013
The President wants
to take out the building

896
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,179
with a missile strike.

897
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,046
With the Secretary
and his daughter inside?

898
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:37,177
Yes.

899
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:39,011
Let me speak to the President.

900
00:42:39,077 --> 00:42:40,907
Jack, I've been trying
to get through to him myself.

901
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:45,003
I'm sorry. You're going to have
to clear the area.

902
00:42:46,202 --> 00:42:48,668
Jack, don't go in
there by yourself.

903
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,800
Jack, talk to me.

904
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,664
The air strike's
already been ordered.

905
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:54,596
Jack, clear the area.

906
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:56,761
The building is going
to be destroyed.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
