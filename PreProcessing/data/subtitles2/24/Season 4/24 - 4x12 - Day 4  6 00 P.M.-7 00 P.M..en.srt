1
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,279
Previously On 24

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,600
There are five nuclear power
plants ready to melt down.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,700
All I care about right now is
making sure that that doesn't happen.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,700
Your name is on a lease
in a building that was

5
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,600
used by the terrorists
to plan today's attack.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,400
That makes you a prime suspect.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,200
I don't know anything about
some building in chatsworth.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I don't believe you.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,900
Jack... please don'T.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,700
I-I-I don't know the specific
building you're talking about.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,700
I can find out.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,500
How?!

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,700
My corporate records
are stored on my laptop.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,600
Yeah, here it is.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,600
Harris Barnes.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,331
Interpol back-traced a
name and provided a list

17
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,200
of foreign nationals
who've used it in the past.

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,700
Who used it most recently?

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,200
A man named Habib Marwan.

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,500
Okay, we need to find him.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,700
I think we already have.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,100
You okay?

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
I overheard a phone conversation
between Marwan and one of his men.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,400
We have less than 15 minutes.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,600
Have your men secure the floor.

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,200
Curtis and i are going after the override.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,400
stay down!

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,200
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,900
I repeat, the suspect is
impersonating a CTU officer.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,800
Edgar, line one.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,300
It's Curtis.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,100
He has the override.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Is the override logged in?

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,900
Yes.

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,800
Good.

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,500
Send it to channel 11.Hurry up.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
It's starting to respond.

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
It's working, Edgar.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
yes!Yes!

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
The temperature is dropping
on all remaining power plants.

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,300
Miss driscoll?

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
It's about your daughter maya.

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,300
You'd better get down
to the clinic right away.

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,100
Maya?

45
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
Oh!

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,700
Oh... oh, baby... oh... oh...

47
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,199
The following takes place
between 6:00 p. m. and 7:00 p. m.

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
Curtis, I've got some new intel.

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,500
What is it?

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,609
We found out that the man you're looking

51
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,900
for, Habib Marwan, works
for McLennen-Forster.

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,800
Look, they're the ones
that made the override.

53
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,700
How's that possible?

54
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,700
He's working under the
alias, Harris Barnes.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,700
They had no reason to suspect him
because his clearance has checked out.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,300
He must have positioned himself inside
the company so we can use their technology.

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,600
Call McLennen-Forster.

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
Tell them to freeze
Marwan's personal files.

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,000
I did.

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
You want me to send the com team over?

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,100
No.

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,800
We're closer.

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,800
Jack and I will go.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,900
Okay.

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, we know Marwan was in the
building within the last 15 minutes.

66
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,200
I want two tight perimeters set up
here... roadblocks in every direction.

67
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,600
Yeah.

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,800
Jack, I just got off with CTU.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,820
Turns out this guy
Marwan was working for

71
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,900
McLennen-Forster under
the alias Harris Barnes.

72
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,400
I told CTU we'd check it out.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,100
Okay, I'll check it out.

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,900
I want you to take paul
and Audrey back to CTU.

75
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,300
I'll be reachable on my cell.

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
Cassell stays in charge here.

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
This guy's still in the area.
Our teams will pick him up.

78
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,400
Curtis is gonna take you both back to CTU.

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,300
What about you?

80
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,300
I have to go to McLennen-Forster.

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,800
Why that?

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,200
Turns out the man we're
looking for works there.

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,700
Need to get into their computer system?

84
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,300
Yeah.

85
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Okay, I'll go with you.

86
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,700
Why?

87
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
My company sold them their it system.

88
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,900
I used to be a systems analyst.

89
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,400
I designed their databases,
encoded with military security.

90
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,200
Mclennen-forster has personnel on board.

91
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
They're going to help
us get into his files.

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Yeah, well, I can get you in backdoors
those people don't even know about.

93
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,800
All right.

94
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,700
You go with me.

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Audrey, I want you to stay with Curtis.

96
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,600
I'll be on my cell.

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,100
Let's go.

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,400
Stop.

99
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,800
Good-bye, baby girl.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Okay.

101
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,700
I'll let everyone here know.

102
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,700
Yeah, thanks.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,100
Let everyone know what?

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
Driscoll's daughter committed
suicide in our clinic.

105
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,200
Committed suicide.
How did she do that?

106
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,000
She slit her wrist.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Doesn't make any sense.
She was being watched.

108
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know, Edgar.

109
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,800
I wasn't there!

110
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
I was just thinking out loud.
You don't have to be so hostile.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Where's driscoll?

113
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
The president is about to come on.

114
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,200
Something terrible just happened, sir.

115
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,900
What's that?

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,300
Ms. Driscoll's daughter maya committed
suicide in our clinic about 15 minutes ago.

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,600
Erin... Sarah just told me.

118
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,800
I am so sorry.

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,100
Thank you, sir.

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,400
Go back to the floor, Sarah.

121
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,500
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Erin, you do not need to be here.

123
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,900
Where should I be, sir?

124
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,500
We're still in crisis mode.

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,577
Habib Marwan is still out
there and we have no idea

126
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:32,000
how many other cells he
might be trying to activate.

127
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,870
For god's sake, Erin...

128
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,500
our systems are in a transition state
that require my constant attention.

129
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,900
I'm not in denial about my
daughter's death, nor am I in shock.

130
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,800
I can perform my duties until you
find a suitable replacement for me.

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,100
Secretary Heller, Ms. Driscoll,
the president's coming on now.

132
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Thank you

133
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Jim,Erin...

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,800
first I want to express my deep gratitude
for what you've accomplished so far today.

135
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,600
Wrestling back control of the override
has saved thousands of american lives.

136
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,879
The latest nrc report is that the San

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,900
Gabriel island meltdown
is now under control.

138
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,000
That's great news, Mr. President.

139
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,800
But has your staff informed you that we
still have a few problems to deal with?

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,700
Yes, and that's why I'm calling.

141
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,600
I understand the man responsible
for today's attack is still at large.

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,700
Yes, sir, he is.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,100
His name is Habib Marwan.

144
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,400
He's been a long-term employee
of a major defense contractor.

145
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,100
Yes, I heard, McLennen-Forster.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
This Habib Marwan-

147
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,608
do you believe that the
melting down of the reactors was

148
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,100
his endgame or do you think
he's planning something else?

149
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,300
As long as he's still out there,
we have to assume it's not over.

150
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,300
Erin, exactly where are we
on apprehending this man?

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,700
All our resources are being deployed
to that end right now, Mr. President.

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll have more information in a few
minutes once I've been briefed by my staff.

153
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
But we know Marwan's in los
angeles, and we will find him.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,392
Using the alias of Harris
Barnes, Marwan worked at

155
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:39,300
McLennen-Forster for the last
two years as a senior engineer.

156
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,900
His most recent project there was
designing the development of the override.

157
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,000
Before that?

158
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,300
Well, here's the timeline
we've pieced together.

159
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,700
He went to graduate school
in england, then worked

160
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,800
for several years for a
company outside of london.

161
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,700
But it's not clear whether he
was radicalized there before that.

162
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,585
But the one thing we do know is that
from the day he arrived in the U.S.,

163
00:08:57,585 --> 00:08:59,800
everything he did was about today.

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
What were his other duties
at McLennen-Forster?

165
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
We don't know yet.

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,100
We're taking a first
pass at his records now.

167
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,803
I'm looking into the
possibility that he may have used

168
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:11,500
McLennen-Forster as a base
to recruit his sleeper cells.

169
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
And that brings up another issue.

170
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,300
At present time, we have over 80% of
field personnel looking for Marwan.

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,750
I'm just wondEring if we
shouldn't divert part of that

172
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,800
manpower trying to root out
some of these other cells.

173
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,300
Erin?

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
I'm sorry, tony. What was the question?

175
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,800
Do you think we should reduce
the field load on Marwan?

176
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,650
How about we take some
of our people off Marwan

177
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:43,400
but still keep a floor
of 60% looking for him?

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,700
Would that work?

179
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,900
Yes... that would work.

180
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,200
Okay.

181
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Edgar, I want you to relocate personnel.

182
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Based on what?

183
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
Keep the people who've come in the
last six hours working on Marwan.

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I want the most alert
people focused on him.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Are we going to ignore
what just happened here?

186
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,500
What do you mean?

187
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,000
She's talking about Erin driscoll.

188
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
She can't focus.

189
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,500
She shouldn't be running this place.

190
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,300
Her daughter died a few minutes ago.

191
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Give her a little more time.

192
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,400
More time?

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,700
Edgar, since when do we
have the luxury of time?

194
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,700
She's not stupid, Sally.

195
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
She knows what's at stake here.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,400
You're right, Sarah.

197
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,800
We don't have the luxury of time.

198
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
We have work to do. Now, work does not
include deciding Erin driscoll's fate.

199
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
I think we have to tell Secretary Heller.

200
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,900
No, we don'T. Not yet.

201
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Now let's get back on it.

202
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,000
Hey, it's me.

203
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,800
Where are you?

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
Curtis and I just arrived at CTU.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,820
Listen, I want you to
get the security detail

206
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,600
and go back to the
hotel and just some rest.

207
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
Jack, I can't leave.

208
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,200
Not now.

209
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,500
My father still needs my help.

210
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,900
Are you at McLennen-Forster yet?

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,700
Almost.

212
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,400
Jack, can you make me a promise?

213
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,100
What?

214
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,000
Take care of Paul.

215
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
He's not like you.

216
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,200
Please, Jack, promise me
that you will look after him.

217
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,900
Yeah, I will.

218
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,600
Thank you.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later.

220
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,400
All right, bye.

221
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,305
Look, uh...

222
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't resent you.

223
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,868
Well, uh...

224
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,900
you didn't steal my wife- we
were separated and it's fair-

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
but I'm not gonna let you take her from me.

226
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,800
I don't think that's really up to you.

227
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,300
Or me.

228
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
No, maybe it isn'T.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,700
But... she... still has feelings for me.

230
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
I can hear it in her voice.

231
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,000
And I'm gonna fight to
keep those feelings alive.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,700
Well, you're gonna have
to do what you gotta do.

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,477
None of field agents
at the rocklyn building

234
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:37,600
have been able to pick
up a threat on Marwan.

235
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,800
It's starting to look
like he might've escaped.

236
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,252
So I think we have to assume
that the first thing he's

237
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,600
going to try to do is activate
some of these sleeper cells.

238
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,500
I agree.

239
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,817
He'll most likely launch a strike right

240
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:50,300
away, create fear that
we're still vulnerable.

241
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,700
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm not feeling very well.

242
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Erin.

243
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,900
Sit down.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,700
You all right?

245
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,400
get me medical up here right away.

246
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Erin Driscoll needs assistance.

247
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,900
No, I'm fine. I don't need anybody.

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,100
I just... got a little
light-headed for a second there.

249
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,200
No, I don't need you here.

250
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
It's all right. I was dizzy,
but I... I feel better.

251
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
Well, take a break, get something to eat.

252
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,800
Take Ms. Driscoll down,
and get her some food.

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
I can handle the situation
here while you rest.

254
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,000
Come on.

255
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,100
All right.

256
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,800
That's probably a good idea.

257
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
She's going to need to be relieved of duty.

258
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,700
Contact division, alert them to the
situation, and tell them to send someone.

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,700
I ran this office for two years.

260
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,300
I could take over for Erin
on a provisional basis.

261
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Forget for the moment that you
technically don't even work here.

262
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,700
You've been away quite a while.

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,200
You're not fluent with the new systeMs.

264
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
With all due respect, sir,
you don't need a programmer.

265
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,700
What you need a decision maker who
knows how to stack up protocols.

266
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,700
And you can do that?

267
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,100
Yes, sir, I can.

268
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,400
Fine.

269
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,393
Effective immediately,
you're the interim

270
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:34,700
director of CTU los
angeles under my authority.

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,079
I still want to contact district, have

272
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,200
them send someone on
a more permanent basis.

273
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,300
I understand, sir.

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,700
Sarah, do you have the abstract
on McLennen-Forster yet?

275
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
One second.

276
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm finishing it now.

277
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,700
all right.

278
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,500
McLennen-forster was a principal
contractor in the design of the override.

279
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,782
and Marwan- under the
alias of Harris Barnes......

280
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:13,200
had full security
access on that project.

281
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,200
And you ran fbi checks on the others
that were involved in the project?

282
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,400
Yes, they came up clean.

283
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,400
So we're dealing with a terrorist who
had inside access to a defense contractor.

284
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,400
ACTUally, more than that, curtis.

285
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,058
McLennen-forster, in
addition to being a weapons

286
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,800
manufaCTUrer, trains their
clients to use those weapons.

287
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,000
International clients?

288
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,800
Yes.

289
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,000
Several countries in the
balkans, asia and the middle east.

290
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,400
This is a messy situation.

291
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,420
When Jack gets to McLennen-Forster,
he's going to have to get into

292
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:46,000
those company records and find
out exactly who Marwan dealt with.

293
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
It's not going to be that easy.

294
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,200
This reflects on the company.

295
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,644
They'll be reluctant
to give up incriminating

296
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,600
information... even if Marwan
were the only guilty party.

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Mr. McLennen, we need to talk
seriously before CTU gets here.

298
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,500
What's the problem?

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,304
It was more than a coincidence
that one of our products, the

300
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,500
override, was stolen and used
in today's terrorist attack.

301
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
What do you mean, more than a coincidence?

302
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,700
The entire operation

303
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,500
everything from Secretary
Heller's kidnapping to the meltdown

304
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,800
of san gabriel island, was organized
by one of our own employees.

305
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,900
What are you talking about?

306
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,600
One of our engineers

307
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,500
a man who we now know is a
terrorist named Habib Marwan

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400
was running his own covert
organization from within our company.

309
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
When did you find this out?

310
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,200
A couple minutes ago.

311
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,180
They called and said
that one of our employees,

312
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,700
Harris Barnes, was
aCTUally Habib Marwan.

313
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,400
Who else knows about this?

314
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,600
Just the two of us... and Conlin.

315
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,300
Gentlemen.

316
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,100
I'm David Conlin.

317
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,300
Vp of internal security.

318
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Jack Bauer, with CTU.

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,000
This is Paul Raines.

320
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,600
Jack.

321
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Paul.

322
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,700
How can I help you?

323
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,200
I need to speak with
your CEO, Gene McLennen.

324
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,300
Gene's in a meeting with a
couple of directors right now.

325
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
He asked me to assist you.

326
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,300
I've access to everything in the building.

327
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
I'm sorry, but maybe my office
didn't make itself clear.

328
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,400
This is a matter of national security.

329
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,300
I need to speak with Mr. McLennen now.

330
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I understand.

331
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,000
Let me see what I can do.

332
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,800
What's the matter?

333
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
Something's not right.

334
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,400
John, I'm not going to keep this a secret.

335
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
We have to let the
government know, right away.

336
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
Sir, if you do this...

337
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,600
it will, with 100% certainty,
be the end of this company.

338
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Now you built
McLennen-Forster from scratch.

339
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Everything you have is tied up in it.

340
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,478
If this comes out, your
name will be synonymous

341
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,100
with what happened
today- terrorism, treason.

342
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,900
Well, what do you want me to
do, John, lie to the government?

343
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,004
Look, if I knew 24 hours
ago what I know now, I

344
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,300
would've done whatever it
took to stop today's attack.

345
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,000
But there's nothing we can do now

346
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,601
except protect ourselves and
keep this company from going

347
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:20,300
under, which it will do if CTU
finds out the truth about Marwan.

348
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,900
John, CTU will subpoena the file.

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
They will find out the truth.

350
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,400
They won't, Gene.

351
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,600
I promise you.

352
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,400
Conlin and I can deal
with this, if you let us.

353
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,900
I don't like the sound of this.

354
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,000
Mr. McLennen, we implicitly
violated national security procedure.

355
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,500
This could mean prison time.

356
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,200
We've got to protect ourselves.

357
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Did you get the latest casualty
figures in san gabriel island?

358
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
No, not yet.

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Which version of the datalink security
system are you currently running?

360
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Excuse me?

361
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,900
One of my companies
produces... for datalink.

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,100
We installed your system.

363
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You at 3.4 or 3.5?

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,500
Uh, 3.5

365
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,400
Will that work for you?

366
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,300
Yeah.

367
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Thanks.

368
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,800
Dave, come on in.

369
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,700
John Reese, Chief Technology Officer.

370
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,600
That's right. You helped us identify
the override earlier. Jack Bauer.

371
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
It's good to meet you in person.

372
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,000
And I'm Gene McLennen.

373
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm, uh, sorry I was delayed.

374
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
Thank you for your time, sir.

375
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,100
So how can I help CTU?

376
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,200
One of your employees, a Harris
Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan,

377
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,120
one of the terrorists
responsible for today's

378
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,900
attack and the theft
of the override device.

379
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,722
We need you to take your IT systems

380
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,900
off-line so Paul can
look into his directory.

381
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,600
We can do that.

382
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,800
Can't we, John?

383
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Absolutely.

384
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,400
Follow me.

385
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,100
Thank you, sir.

386
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,900
Certainly.

387
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:48,538
Maybe you should go home.

388
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,326
I'm afraid to.

389
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,291
When my wife, Susan, died,

390
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,403
I didn't deal with it at all.

391
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,251
Actually, I went to work the next day.

392
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:10,186
I remember thinking to
myself, "that's life. "

393
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,691
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

394
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:14,706
Get over it and get on with it.

395
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:19,768
A few weeks later, I
answered a call from an old

396
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,612
friend of Susan's who
did not know she had died.

397
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,678
And when I heard myself saying,

398
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,224
"Susan has passed away,"

399
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,284
when I actually said those words,

400
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:38,932
It hit me.

401
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:44,051
All the pain I was trying to
shut out just overwhelmed me.

402
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,395
Erin, you can't keep it inside.

403
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:55,266
you cry, you blame god

404
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,891
you blame yourself, and
then you cry some more.

405
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,058
And all the while, you
let your friends help you.

406
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,184
It's pretty simple.

407
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:07,315
Very painful.

408
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,673
and I am so, so sorry for you.

409
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:13,929
Dad, I just want...

410
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,547
oh, um, uh, uh, I'm sorry. I...

411
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,759
I-I just wanted to let
you know that I was back.

412
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,351
I will go home.

413
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:34,291
You should go, and make
sure your daughter's okay.

414
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,672
If you need me, I'll be on the floor.

415
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,035
Excuse me, sir?

416
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,786
Tony just told me you
put him in charge of ctu?

417
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:56,922
That's correct.

418
00:22:57,887 --> 00:22:59,258
That doesn't make any sense.

419
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,052
He just got reinstated,
and I'm second-in-command.

420
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:03,653
Tony had Erin's job for two years.

421
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:05,455
He has experience running the ctu.

422
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:06,255
You don't.

423
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:08,304
- With all due respect...
- relax, Curtis.

424
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,989
It's provisional, till
district finds someone else.

425
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,730
For the record... I don't like it.

426
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:16,439
What do you hear from Bauer?

427
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,160
He just arrived at
McLennen-Forster a few minutes ago.

428
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:22,467
He's gonna call on the com if
he picks up interference there.

429
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:31,294
Okay, that was Marwan's
work station in the corner.

430
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:34,246
His computer is tied into
the engineering sub-net.

431
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,315
What about the rest of the network?

432
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:38,230
Can you get into it from his account?

433
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,415
Yeah, I think there's a way to do that.

434
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,734
All right, you've got two windows.

435
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:00,266
One shows you his files in the system.

436
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:02,137
and the other will get
you outside the sub-net.

437
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:03,728
All right.

438
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:05,826
Let me know if you need anything.

439
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:08,628
thanks for your help.

440
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,911
This guy looks like he knows
his way around our system.

441
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:22,826
Don't worry.
I'll be able to control things from here.

442
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:23,949
He won't find a thing.

443
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:28,694
Marwan purged a lot of files.

444
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:31,543
When?

445
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,624
Deletion dates aren't coming up.

446
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:35,794
That means they could
have been deleted today.

447
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,736
Marwan wasn't here today.

448
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:40,962
He was in rocklyn for the override.

449
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:43,222
Maybe someone else deleted the files.

450
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,165
There.

451
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:50,314
All right, let me see what I can find.

452
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:56,932
yeah?

453
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,734
I had to open up a socket for him.

454
00:24:59,087 --> 00:24:59,916
I can see it.

455
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:01,736
Are they gonna be able to find anything?

456
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,624
As long as I can see where he's
looking and stay ahead of him

457
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,098
I should be able to delete
the incriminating files.

458
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:09,358
All right. I'm coming up.

459
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:11,710
What if you can't stay ahead of him?

460
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,828
What happens then?

461
00:25:13,482 --> 00:25:14,496
There are other options.

462
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:15,668
What other options?

463
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:17,668
We'll set off an EMP.

464
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,339
A pulse bomb?

465
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:22,456
Are you out of your mind?

466
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:27,209
You'll destroy every piece of
hardware we have in this building.

467
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,059
It'll cripple us electronically.

468
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:31,161
That's the point.

469
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:46,014
This is the hand-over sequence for com.

470
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,116
I'll have the default password in place.

471
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:51,877
You can reset it as
soon as you're done here.

472
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:53,612
All right.

473
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:58,149
Here are all the access
codes to ctu and division.

474
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:01,116
Thanks.

475
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,395
Any of my personal stuff...

476
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:08,140
gets in your way, you just have someone
box them and put them into storage.

477
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:29,875
If you need anything, ask Curtis.

478
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:34,123
And if he can't help you, you
can always call me at home.

479
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,135
Thanks.

480
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:24,782
Could I have everybody's
attention, please?

481
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:29,854
By now, you all know
that I've taken over Erin

482
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:32,813
Driscoll's command on a
purely provisional basis.

483
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:34,890
All protocols remain the same.

484
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,082
But I want updates from all
department heads every 15 minutes.

485
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:40,334
Other than that

486
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:42,898
I'm just here to support you.

487
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,277
So, let's get back to work.

488
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:49,299
What do you hear from Jack?

489
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,722
He and Paul Raines are looking
through Marwan's files now.

490
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,840
- Any promising leads?
- Nothing yet.

491
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:55,533
All right. Look, Edgar...

492
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:58,589
before Erin left,

493
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:01,251
she told me the one person
I should rely on was you.

494
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:03,568
She said that?

495
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,038
Yes, she did.

496
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:08,688
So, if anything comes across
your desk you think is important.

497
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,752
I want you to bring it to
me directly, all right?

498
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:11,806
You got it.

499
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:13,239
All right, thanks.

500
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:17,417
Edgar?

501
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:20,512
Have you scanned all the satellite
imagery around the rocklyn building?

502
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,474
Yeah, everything's into
take-down of the override.

503
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,537
All right.

504
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:26,844
I want you to try different
frequency channels on that satellite.

505
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:28,302
Manually?

506
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,899
Yeah, that's the only way
we can be sure to see it all.

507
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,470
You're going to have to
talk to Tony about that.

508
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:35,168
I'm supposed to be backing up Jack and Paul
at McLennen-Forster.

509
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:36,217
put somebody else on that.

510
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,343
This is more important.

511
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:38,893
What's more important?

512
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,709
We've got 75% of our
people on McLennen-Forster.

513
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:44,988
I need Edgar to help me
find a trail to Marwan.

514
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:48,071
No, we don't have much of a chance of
finding anything on Marwan by satellite.

515
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,187
Our best chance of picking up a thread is
through those files at McLennen-Forster.

516
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:51,719
Stay on that.

517
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,961
We can't afford one security-grade
analyst going over imagery?

518
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:55,390
Yeah, one.
But not Edgar.

519
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:56,882
Put somebody else on it.

520
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:58,623
Tony?

521
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,600
Are we trying to accomplish
the same thing here,

522
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:04,299
or is this about you
establishing position?

523
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,041
I don't have to establish position.

524
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,536
I've already got it.

525
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:11,657
Now, what do you say we stop
wasting time arm-wrestling here?

526
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,659
I respect your opinion.

527
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:17,050
But we're going to
disagree from time to time,

528
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:18,631
and when we do, we're
going to do it my way.

529
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,189
Fine.

530
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,393
But I suggest you put more manpower
into a data search for Marwan.

531
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,431
All right, grab a couple of
people from image processing.

532
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:25,580
Work the satellites with them.

533
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:28,466
Curtis?

534
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:35,065
don't worry.

535
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:37,686
I'm gonna be out of here
when this crisis is over.

536
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:40,195
But in the meantime, I
want the same thing you do.

537
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,247
I want to find Habib Marwan, all right?

538
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:14,826
Is everything all right?

539
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:16,716
I heard you had a problem.

540
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:20,289
CTU got to the override before the
other nuclear plants melted down.

541
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:24,368
Well, at least you're safe.

542
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:25,822
For now.

543
00:30:27,184 --> 00:30:28,361
But they know who I am.

544
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:30,761
They'll be tracking me
with everything they've got.

545
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:32,804
How does that affect our scheduling?

546
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:33,719
It doesn't.

547
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:35,162
Stay on task.

548
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,659
Make sure everything at the air force
base is ready when I give the order.

549
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,013
I checked in with everyone
as of ten minutes ago.

550
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,829
We're gonna make this thing happen, Habib.

551
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,046
Now, remember...

552
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:49,062
when you're done, get in touch with Prodo.

553
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,612
He'll get you out of the country.

554
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:52,385
And you?

555
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:14,076
Go.

556
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,707
good.

557
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:45,189
What?

558
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,890
I can rebuild the files
from these empty directories.

559
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:00,794
Damn it.

560
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:01,812
What's he doing?

561
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:03,847
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

562
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:05,706
How can he do that?

563
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,708
I don't know.

564
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:09,269
It's not a documented
function of this system.

565
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,424
He must be using some
hook left into the design.

566
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,496
They're gonna find evidence
we sold arms to terrorists.

567
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:16,496
Not necessarily.

568
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:18,581
The pulse bomb...

569
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:20,757
we have to use it now.

570
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:36,481
research six.

571
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:37,506
Set it off.

572
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:40,149
- Sir, there was no test scheduled today.
- This isn't a test.

573
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,947
Open up the safety
chamber and set it off now.

574
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:43,584
Yes, sir.

575
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,473
We set off this EMP, CTU will know
we're trying to hide something.

576
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:48,224
Well, not necessarily.
Marwan's their suspect.

577
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:49,230
They'll assume he was behind it.

578
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:51,545
And what about the damage it'll do
to threst of the infrastructure?

579
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:53,632
A lot better than destroying
the entire company.

580
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,606
It'll take some time, but we can rebuild.

581
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:29,694
yeah?

582
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:31,519
The EMP has been activated, sir.

583
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:32,576
And the shield door is open.

584
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:33,347
Okay, good.

585
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:35,918
It's been activated.

586
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:38,833
It will take ten minutes to
charge up before its release.

587
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:04,351
Edgar?

588
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:05,019
What?

589
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,946
The phone TAPS you wanted at
McLennen-Forster aren't holding.

590
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:08,808
What do you mean not holding?

591
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:11,207
The connection keeps drifting.
I have to reset the patterns.

592
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,881
Is there a problem on our end?

593
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,201
Check their power supply.
It could be their PBX.

594
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:21,819
Oh, my god.
Look at this thing.

595
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,330
The amplitude's fluctuating like crazy.

596
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:26,217
I thought you checked that
before you set the TAPS.

597
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:27,546
I did.
It was fine then.

598
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:29,127
Let me call Jack.

599
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,631
That cellular customer is out of range.

600
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,243
Yes, I need to speak with Jack Bauer.

601
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:43,142
He's a CTU agent working
in Parris Barnes office.

602
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,128
hello?

603
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:47,730
Hello?

604
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,935
What's going on?

605
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,372
That's strange- all of a sudden the land
lines around McLennen-Forster are out.

606
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,232
Can we use the network to message him?

607
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,167
Yeah, so far the computers
haven't been affected.

608
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,680
All right, open up a
window for me, would you?

609
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,191
what the hell's this?

610
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:17,105
I don't know.

611
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:27,402
Something's wrong.

612
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,815
I got to respond.

613
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,767
Can you pipe that window
over to this computer?

614
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:33,029
Yeah, just give me an ethernet address.

615
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,943
6-e-f-f-3-2-3-9.

616
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:55,037
Almost got these files rebuilt.

617
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:01,560
Sarah, do we have any data
points outside that building?

618
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:03,481
I'm on line with the phone company now.

619
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:04,934
They're getting
complaints as far as eight

620
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:06,555
blocks away from the
McLennen-Forster building.

621
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:15,089
- Have you still got a connection?
- Yeah, I got it. Look at this.

622
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:18,809
son of a bitch,It's encrypted.

623
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:20,389
It's got to be it. Print it out, now.

624
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,007
Now!

625
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,564
Damn it.

626
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:29,148
They've got something.

627
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,237
What?

628
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:33,006
I can't read it- how much
longer till this thing goes off?

629
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,397
Any second now, we should be fine.

630
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,009
We're not fine.
He's printing it.

631
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,181
What are you going to do now?

632
00:36:37,414 --> 00:36:38,263
Take care of it.

633
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:41,056
I don't believe this.

634
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,283
We're dealing with an EMP.

635
00:36:56,229 --> 00:36:57,970
Mclennen-forster were
leading the way in

636
00:36:57,971 --> 00:37:00,009
developing a nonlethal
weapon for the military.

637
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:00,640
What is it?

638
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:02,783
An electromagnetic pulse bomb.

639
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:03,975
Once it goes off

640
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:07,247
everything within its radius that
has electrical components gets fried.

641
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,226
Lights, cars, computers.

642
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,520
Every piece of electronic
data just disappears.

643
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,638
Vanish forever.

644
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:13,843
Well, how long have we got?

645
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:14,808
I don't know.

646
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:16,736
Its capacitors are still charging.

647
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,298
Come on.

648
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:22,341
All right, the printer's warmed up.

649
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:38,643
Sarah, do we have any
choppers in that area?

650
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:41,606
Yeah, one.

651
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,970
If that chopper's in the air when
that EMP goes off it's going to

652
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,281
knock out its whole electrical
system and that chopper's going down.

653
00:37:47,444 --> 00:37:48,846
Get him out of the area now.

654
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,810
Edgar, where's this coming from?

655
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,919
From McLennen-Forster.
I'm trying to get a position now.

656
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:54,430
CTU 3, do you hear me?

657
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,447
CTU 3, do you copy?

658
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,125
All right, this is coming through.

659
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:05,783
[EMP is on first floor. Room 12.]

660
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:09,206
Okay, they found the EMP.
I'm going to try and stop it.

661
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:10,068
If I don't

662
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,130
I want you to take the hard copy, try
and meet me in the front of the building.

663
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,008
Dave, Bauer ran out- he must
have found out about the emp.

664
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:22,590
Neil, CTU agent's heading down toward you.
Don't let him anywhere near it.

665
00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:24,717
Mr. Conlin...

666
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,060
is everything all right?

667
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,936
As you can see, we're having some
problems with the electricity.

668
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:31,356
Jack just went to check it out.

669
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,756
Saw you were printing something.

670
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,822
How'd you know that?

671
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:36,991
We were searching the
system same time you were.

672
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,449
Trying to help you guys out.

673
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:42,162
Mind if I take a look?

674
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:43,863
Sure.

675
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,751
It's, uh, just in the printer.

676
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:34,486
yeah?

677
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:35,891
Two's clear, I'm moving to three.

678
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:36,861
All right.

679
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:22,832
oh, my god.

680
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:46,223
I've got to stop it.

681
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:28,651
you got nowhere to go, man.

682
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,889
Doors are locked.

683
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:32,220
Where's the printout?

684
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:39,342
Where is it?

685
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:44,128
Come on.

686
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:57,354
One of our choppers is down.

687
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:58,923
Send medical in now.

688
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:00,982
Call all field teams outside
the perimeter of the blast.

689
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:02,174
We have to find Jack and Paul.

690
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,543
Sir, we have a problem.

691
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:13,960
Someone set off an EMP blast in
the McLennen-Forster building.

692
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:15,506
We believe Jack and Paul are still inside.

693
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:18,656
I assume that's a response
to our presence there.

694
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:21,486
Someone does not want us to
get a hold of Marwan's file.

695
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:23,731
Jack was able to pull some
information before the blast

696
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:26,297
but we don't know whether it was
Marwan or somebody else that set it off.

697
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:27,129
Excuse me, sir,

698
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,867
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.

699
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:30,234
She just passed through security.

700
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:31,425
Thank you.

701
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:34,049
That was fast.

702
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,217
We got lucky.

703
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:38,342
Division had someone available with the

704
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:41,292
appropriate qualifications
and CTU experience.

705
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:42,579
I understand.

706
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,262
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in,

707
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,032
and I'd like you to stick
around and assist Miss Dessler.

708
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:48,808
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:49,759
Who?

710
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:52,165
Michele Dessler, do you know her?

711
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:02,476
I used to be married to her.
