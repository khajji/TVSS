2
00:00:10,204 --> 00:00:12,036
Previously on 24.

3
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:17,681
For God's sake, pull
yourself together.

4
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,002
You didn't have to kill her.

5
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:20,238
Yes, I did,

6
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:22,928
because you didn't have the
courage to kill her yourself.

7
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:26,578
Courage? To poison a girl
who did no harm to you at all?

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,002
This is my husband Navi.

9
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:30,863
This is Debbie's mother.

10
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:31,817
Is she here?

11
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:34,989
We haven't seen
her since yesterday.

12
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,905
Get in the car, follow her.

13
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,183
Make sure she doesn't
go to the police.

14
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:40,648
Chloé, you're out of here.

15
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:41,872
Chloe.

16
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:45,182
Don't worry, Edgar. Driscoll
doesn't know you were helping me.

17
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:46,559
She doesn't?

18
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:47,839
I'm the one who
got you into this,

19
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,296
I'm not going to sell you out.

20
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,818
We'll be here until you
tell me what I need to know.

21
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:57,801
Richard, your father was
kidnapped by terrorists.

22
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,666
Our polygraph analysis tells us

23
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,149
you're hiding something
that might help us find him.

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,288
There are people on the
outside looking for us.

25
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:06,178
You cannot give up.

26
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:09,173
I have to do something
while I still can.

27
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:11,236
This trial is going
to be a spectacle,

28
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:13,042
broadcast all over the world,

29
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:16,525
designed to humiliate
and degrade this country.

30
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:18,403
There's a gas pipe.

31
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,057
Did you check
out the briefcase?

32
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:23,173
Mm. It's fine.

33
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,989
I was afraid it might be
damaged in the train crash.

34
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,827
The case is very strong.

35
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,056
Come on! Get them out!

36
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,934
Now! Come on!

37
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:35,925
Hurry, open the door! Now!

38
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,808
I know you.

39
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,497
She recognized me.

40
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,328
She has to be killed.

41
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:42,922
Erin, I'm on sight.

42
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:43,986
Jack, stand down.

43
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:45,326
What are you talking about?

44
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,039
The Marines won't
get there on time.

45
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,255
The President wants to
take out the building

46
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,365
with a missile strike.

47
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:50,066
With the secretary

48
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,191
and his daughter inside?

49
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:51,995
Yes.

50
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:52,848
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:55,315
You're going to have
to clear the area.

52
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,505
Jack, don't go in there alone.

53
00:01:57,505 --> 00:02:01,586
Jack, clear the area! The
building is going to be destroyed!

54
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:08,101
The following takes places
between 12:00 P.M. and 01:00 P.M.

55
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:14,946
James Heller, you have been
brought before this court of law

56
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:18,414
to stand trial
as a war criminal.

57
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,246
We will prove to the
people of the world

58
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:24,813
that these crimes against
humanity are the direct result

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,279
of the polices initiated
by you in your capacity.

60
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:39,492
Since the true extent of your
evil legacy is immeasurable,

61
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,069
we have done our best
to document those acts

62
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,817
which have been
witnessed directly

63
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:45,792
by the chosen followers.

64
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,812
Under your orders, the
death squads of America,

65
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:51,139
continue their imperious crusade

66
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,327
against the true believers
and pure followers.

67
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:54,689
How much longer
until the fighter

68
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,083
is ready to launch the missile?

69
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,291
Command and control is
locking on target now.

70
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:02,294
Mr. President, I have Erin
Driscoll on line three.

71
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:11,952
Mr. President, I'm calling

72
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:14,285
to ask you to consider
aborting the missile strike.

73
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:15,537
Based on what?

74
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:18,068
We are attempting
a rescue operation.

75
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:20,165
I was told that the
Marine Strike Force

76
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,155
was still 10 to
20 minutes away.

77
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,155
They are, sir.

78
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:25,404
Jack Bauer went in by himself.

79
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:34,847
The terrorist group is
moments away from executing

80
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,519
the Secretary of Defense
in front of the world.

81
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,845
And I cannot allow
that to happen.

82
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,563
I understand, sir.

83
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:42,867
But if Jack can effect a
rescue before that happens...

84
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,812
In that case, I'll
abort the missile strike.

85
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,788
But he's running out of time.

86
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,484
How long does he have, sir?

87
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:53,788
Seven minutes.

88
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,884
Try and make a sound,
I'll blow your head off.

89
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,572
This is a map of the complex.

90
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:09,215
Where are they holding
the Secretary of Defense?

91
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,422
I am either going
to kill you now,

92
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:12,606
or you're going to
tell me where they are

93
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,221
staging the trial!

94
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,984
Point... now. Where is the secretary?

95
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,584
There is no place in this world

96
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,528
where your evil has not scoured

97
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,297
the sacred land of the true word.

98
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:42,379
Your imperialistic
legacy has devoured

99
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,438
the lives of the innocent.

100
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:46,819
- Jack?
- Yeah?

101
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,077
The President won't call
off the missile strike.

102
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,253
How much time do I have?

103
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:50,896
Less than six minutes.

104
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:53,677
Did you get a read from

105
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,627
the thermal scan on
how many hostiles inside?

106
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,346
We estimate 16.

107
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:58,829
Jack?

108
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:01,037
I'm not turning back, Erin.

109
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,375
Understood.

110
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,907
Good luck.

111
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,916
...the injustices that
you have committed...

112
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,181
Stop this, please.

113
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:28,908
...on behalf of...

114
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,912
Just stop this, please.

115
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,033
You've got to stop this.

116
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,129
My father hasn't done
anything to hurt you.

117
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,363
He's an innocent man. Please!

118
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:44,143
Please. He's innocent.

119
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,837
Please.

120
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,075
Listen to me.

121
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,365
Please, no, no,
no, wait, wait, no.

122
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,824
You've got to stop it! Listen.

123
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:00,707
Audrey?

124
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,095
Behind you.

125
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,623
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:06,225
Jack!

127
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:08,452
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

128
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,337
No, I'm okay.

129
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,908
You've got to stop them.

130
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:12,489
I will.

131
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,873
Get my father first.

132
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,996
Go.

133
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,816
Take this.

134
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:35,326
Press the button on the handle.

135
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,201
You use that if you have to.

136
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:45,339
I'll be back for you, I promise.

137
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,255
Jack.

138
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:03,861
Finally, we hold you
responsible for blasphemy.

139
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,445
For desecrating holy
lands and shrines,

140
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:10,993
and for spilling the
blood of our brothers.

141
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:14,234
James Heller, your
guilt on these charges

142
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,939
is not a matter of dispute.

143
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:23,093
I have, here, a full
confession that you have signed.

144
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:27,249
And so, now, it is time
for your sentence to be read

145
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:29,826
and for the execution of that
sentence to be carried out.

146
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,326
James Heller,

147
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:35,359
before the eyes of God,

148
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:38,366
I sentence you to death...

149
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:42,389
to be carried out... immediately.

150
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,028
Call off the missile. Call it off!

151
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:52,396
Abort. Abort. Please confirm.

152
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:53,505
He's doing it.

153
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,283
There's one in the pipe, safety's off.

154
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:24,312
We've got to get Audrey.

155
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,727
Down the hall.

156
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:27,897
It's been aborted.

157
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:28,854
The strike's been called off.

158
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:29,566
Where are the Marines?

159
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,107
They haven't crossed
the perimeter.

160
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:31,619
I'll get an updated E.T.A.

161
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,486
We're clear.

162
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,722
She was here.

163
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,463
We got to go. Move!

164
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:30,891
Take the two shooters at your 11:00.

165
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:33,905
You ready? Go!

166
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:42,535
Give me a clip.

167
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,162
Jack!

168
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,806
It went off my vest.

169
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,099
It's all right. Keep firing.

170
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,045
I'm out.

171
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:21,777
I'm out, too.

172
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,988
It's the Marines. Stay down!

173
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,997
Mr. Secretary, stay down.

174
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,012
Just stay down until
this area is secure.

175
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:35,638
Jack!

176
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,184
Jack! Jack!

177
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:37,738
Put the gun down!

178
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,718
Step back or I'll kill her!

179
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:39,502
Put the gun down!

180
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:40,725
Step back! I will kill her!

181
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:42,058
Step back!

182
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:43,451
I will kill her!

183
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,656
I will kill her!

184
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,538
Do it!

185
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,766
Okay. Okay, just relax.

186
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:53,888
Now just stay calm.

187
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:57,382
Just relax.

188
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:58,868
This is over.

189
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:01,104
You're surrounded.

190
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,373
You're right.

191
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,903
First, you'll watch her die.

192
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,265
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:07,174
The President sends along his gratitude.

194
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:08,934
I'm just glad you both are all right.

195
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:09,801
It's been a while since you've been

196
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:11,215
in the field, Jack.

197
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:12,008
Looks like you haven't skipped a beat.

198
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:14,943
Audrey and I owe you our lives.

199
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,288
Thank you, sir.

200
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,614
I've arranged transportation

201
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:18,836
for us back to CTU.

202
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,043
I'd like you and Audrey

203
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,811
to be debriefed there.

204
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:21,894
Just as long as we don't lose

205
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:25,518
any time in finding out
who these terrorists are

206
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:26,764
and where they're coming from.

207
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,277
As soon as we get back there,

208
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,316
I'll set up a live feed

209
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:30,227
with the office in Washington.

210
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,882
You won't miss a step.

211
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:32,825
Those soldiers there are

212
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:33,554
waiting to take us back

213
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:35,613
- to CTU.
- Thanks.

214
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,501
How's she doing?

215
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,426
The doctor needs to check out

216
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:41,555
some of these contusions

217
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,559
and she's dehydrated.

218
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,843
Thank you.

219
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,907
- You should go.
- Where?

220
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,337
I'm taking you and
your father back to CTU

221
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,852
Jack, when I was inside, I-I
recognized one of the men.

222
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,264
Who?

223
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:54,869
I don't know.

224
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,638
I-I can't place him, but I know

225
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,984
that I saw him before today.

226
00:13:58,984 --> 00:13:59,764
They're going to correlate

227
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,576
a photo file of all the casualties.

228
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,345
As soon as they've got
that, you can make your I.D.

229
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,829
Excuse me. Bauer.

230
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,977
Agent Bauer, this is CTU.

231
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,694
I've got Paul Raines, on the line.

232
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,502
He'd like to speak to his wife.

233
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:12,969
Is she with you?

234
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,726
Hold on one second.

235
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,179
It's Paul.

236
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:18,825
He wants to speak with you.

237
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,388
Paul.

238
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,696
Audrey.

239
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:27,585
Are you okay?

240
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,333
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

241
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,445
Thank God.

242
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:32,427
Where are you?

243
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:33,381
As soon as I heard about you

244
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:35,591
and your father, I got on a plane.

245
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,344
You're in L.A.?

246
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,486
Yeah. I'm at CTU.

247
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,811
Audrey?

248
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,157
Yeah.

249
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,356
See you soon.

250
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,757
I'll see you soon.

251
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,654
We need to go.

252
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:57,964
You all right?

253
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,812
Mm-hmm.

254
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,675
Make sure Edgar gets this.

255
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:21,307
Find anything?

256
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:21,867
I'm still trying to connect up

257
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,158
with the feed from the rescue site.

258
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:24,877
Division is using up

259
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:26,268
most of our bandwidth.

260
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,207
Call over there and tell them

261
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,663
to multiplex. We need to start

262
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:28,871
going through the debris.

263
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,024
Yeah, now that Heller is safe,

264
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:32,279
we're no longer in first position.

265
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,915
Miss Driscoll.

266
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,911
I took care of it.

267
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:37,264
What's that?

268
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:39,841
Our list of passcodes
for the FBI fiber.

269
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:41,173
You can use their feed.

270
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,296
How did you get that?

271
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,499
I used to consult there.

272
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,023
I still have friends.

273
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:46,953
As soon as I saw the load

274
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:47,838
on the routing table,

275
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,702
I knew we'd run
into a traffic jam.

276
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:52,358
Good. Install it.

277
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,724
Start cataloging whatever's
there. Anything that flags,

278
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,346
promote it up to me.

279
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:07,553
You know... if
you let me, Curtis,

280
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:10,165
I can help you a whole lot more.

281
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,777
Honestly, I don't even know why

282
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:13,439
you have a problem with me.

283
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,553
Because I'm ambitious?

284
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,952
Okay, I'm ambitious. Aren't you?

285
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:20,113
I don't sleep with people
to get ahead in my career.

286
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:20,885
Neither do I.

287
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:25,127
I slept with you because
I was attracted to you.

288
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:26,936
I still am.

289
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,584
Deal with it.

290
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,696
A White House spokesman
has just confirmed

291
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,102
that the interrupted
video transmission

292
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,542
was caused by a raid

293
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:44,992
mounted by the Marines

294
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,802
and the counter-terrorist
unit, who rescued

295
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:51,119
Secretary of Defense
James Heller moments ago.

296
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:52,837
Yes, I'm watching.

297
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,712
Of course I'm watching.

298
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:55,961
God willing, our good fortune

299
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,652
will continue for the rest of the day.

300
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,219
Thank you.

301
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,134
What are you talking about?

302
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:00,821
It's over.

303
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,882
They found Omar.
The government

304
00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:03,927
stopped the trial.

305
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,028
Yes, I know.

306
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,088
Then how can you say this

307
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,779
is all good fortune?

308
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,807
Everything we've
worked for is ruined.

309
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:10,793
You made me kill someone

310
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,259
I cared about,
all for nothing.

311
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:13,824
No, not for nothing, Behrooz.

312
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,754
The trial was only

313
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,258
our first step.

314
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,738
I don't understand.

315
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,527
There were certain things
that your mother and I decided

316
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,113
to keep from you.

317
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:23,953
What things?

318
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:26,775
Please, I'm busy.

319
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,611
You forced me to
kill my girlfriend

320
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,451
because of this trial.

321
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,629
You owe me an explanation.

322
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:32,629
I don't owe you anything!

323
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:35,812
See who it is.

324
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,054
See who it is!

325
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,732
It's Terrick.

326
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:55,772
Why is he here?

327
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,201
Terrick.

328
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,886
Behrooz, you remember Terrick.

329
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,439
Of course he does.

330
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,103
I just spoke with Madwan.

331
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:15,194
He assured me that everything

332
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:15,997
is still on schedule.

333
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:17,817
- That's right.
- What are you doing here?

334
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,237
Your mother told Madwan

335
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:19,958
you took care of

336
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,717
the American girl?

337
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:22,319
Yeah?

338
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,199
Then you'll need help
getting rid of the body.

339
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,266
I don't need any help.

340
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,294
I can do it myself.

341
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,687
I'm sure you can, Behrooz,

342
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:30,352
but we can't afford
any more mistakes.

343
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:33,023
Show Terrick where the body is.

344
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,251
Go.

345
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:56,897
Okay, Agent Manning, this
is the last of the bodies.

346
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:59,761
- You shoud see them now.
- All right. Got it.

347
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,432
What's next?

348
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:03,512
Here's some more of
the terrorist gear

349
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,439
we collected out
of the warehouse.

350
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:12,879
Wait a second.

351
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,441
top. Go back.

352
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:15,529
You need me to retransmit?

353
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,456
No. On the ground

354
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,005
in front of you. Can you give
me a shot of that briefcase?

355
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:19,946
This?

356
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,398
Yeah. Can you open it?

357
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:28,056
It's empty.

358
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,958
Are there any
identifying marks on it?

359
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:34,221
Some kind of logo
engraved near the lock.

360
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:35,805
Let me see. Zoom in.

361
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:36,829
Zoom in.

362
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,673
Make sure that gets on the
next transport back here.

363
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:44,922
Will do.

364
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:46,851
Sarah. I need you

365
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,531
to do a corporate logo
search. I may have found

366
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,408
a link between the train
crash and Heller's abduction.

367
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:51,241
I'm sending it to you now.

368
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,144
Okay. We'll pick this up later.

369
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:56,297
The man I recognized
at the warehouse-

370
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,826
I want to make that ID.

371
00:19:57,826 --> 00:19:59,712
As soon as you've been
checked out by the clinic.

372
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:00,929
I'll get the photos ready.

373
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,139
Excuse me, Ms. Raines.

374
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:03,006
This way, please.

375
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:05,021
It's all right. Go ahead.

376
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,724
Okay good.

377
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,109
Excuse us.

378
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm going to need
to use your station.

379
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,458
Have Driscoll send me over a
passcode for the onsite feed.

380
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,289
Okay.

381
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,722
Thanks.

382
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:31,321
Does he know?

383
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:36,402
About you and Jack.

384
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,895
How long have you known?

385
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,759
Not until today.

386
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:42,845
Although I'm surprised

387
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:44,983
that I hadn't figured
it out till now.

388
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,729
But it's not what you think.

389
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:49,762
Paul and I were over before Jack
and I started seeing each other.

390
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:50,646
Except Paul doesn't

391
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:50,874
think it's over.

392
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,784
Last time I spoke with him,

393
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,461
he thought he had
a second chance.

394
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,685
Yeah, well, that's more
about fixing his wounded pride

395
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:59,714
than fixing this relationship.

396
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,444
So he doesn't know about it.

397
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,594
Not yet.

398
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,003
I'll take care of it.

399
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,564
This way, please.

400
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:35,382
Yeah.

401
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:37,463
No, not till I get back to DC.

402
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,234
Sarah said you may
have found a thread

403
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:41,384
connecting the train bombing
to Heller's abduction.

404
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:45,856
Yeah. About an hour ago, NTSB
reported that a passenger was killed,

405
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:48,122
but not as a
result of the crash.

406
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,949
He was shot at close range.

407
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:51,927
Who is he?

408
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:53,221
We're still trying
to find out.

409
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:54,519
He had no I.D.

410
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,687
His face and prints

411
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,708
don't show up on any database.

412
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:58,901
But whoever killed him

413
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,553
stole something he had
chained to his wrist.

414
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,401
I think it may have been this.

415
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:05,807
A witness on the train

416
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,105
saw a man with a
briefcase handcuffed to him.

417
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,771
Take a look at the damage.

418
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:11,421
It could have been

419
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:12,882
sustained during the crash.

420
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:14,906
We just recovered this

421
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,591
where Heller was being held.

422
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:17,866
What are you telling me?

423
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:19,754
That the train
bombing was a cover

424
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:21,891
for the theft of this briefcase?

425
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,749
What was in it?

426
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:26,642
It was empty.

427
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:28,888
We traced the corporate
logo on the briefcase

428
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:31,903
to McLennen-Forster.

429
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:34,953
- The defense contractor?
- Yeah.

430
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,988
Have you contacted them?

431
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,626
Just got off the
phone with their CEO.

432
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:38,939
He stonewalled.

433
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:40,413
Said before he
disclosed anything,

434
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:41,519
we'd need special clearance

435
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,184
from the Department
of Defense.

436
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,249
The Secretary should be able

437
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,808
to get us whatever
clearances we need from DOD.

438
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,588
Let's get a
printout of all this.

439
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:50,801
Yeah.

440
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:57,409
...story, only moments ago, a second
broadcast showing secretary of defense

441
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:02,215
James Heller was put on the internet. This
image was captured from that broadcast.

442
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:07,576
At this time, we have no confirmed
report on why the broadcast...

443
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:09,981
The girl's mother went home.

444
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:11,682
Even if she calls the police,

445
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,512
it will be too late.

446
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:18,691
I heard the news in the car.

447
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,351
Everything was accomplished?

448
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,931
Yes.

449
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:23,968
The trial was cut short,

450
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,728
but it served its purpose.

451
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:29,358
When they search
the warehouse,

452
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,817
will they figure
out what we're doing?

453
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:33,454
It doesn't matter.

454
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,459
It's too late for
them to stop it.

455
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,243
If everything is
working on schedule,

456
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:44,704
why do you look so troubled?

457
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:53,111
Where is Behrooz?

458
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:57,181
He went to bury the girl.

459
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,593
But his car is
still in the driveway.

460
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:01,679
He didn't take the car.

461
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,856
I don't understand.

462
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,226
He went with Tariq.

463
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:23,992
Tariq was here?

464
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:25,867
Oh, my God.

465
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,815
He's going to kill my son.

466
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,686
Oh, my God.

467
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:37,842
He's going to kill our son.

468
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,051
Yes.

469
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,836
I told Madwan that Behrooz
took care of the girl.

470
00:24:42,836 --> 00:24:45,888
Madwan must not
have been satisfied.

471
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:47,793
He must have decided that

472
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:49,834
Behrooz was a liability.

473
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,291
How could you let this happen?

474
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,275
How could you let
them kill our son?

475
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:54,376
What could I do?

476
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,846
What could I do?!

477
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:56,867
He's our son!

478
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:59,349
Our flesh and blood!

479
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:00,803
Dina, listen to me.

480
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:03,422
How could you let
them kill our son!

481
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:05,806
Behrooz stopped being
our son a long time ago.

482
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:07,143
How can you say that?

483
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:08,958
Because it's true.

484
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,267
Living here has changed him.

485
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,992
He's been like
a stranger to us.

486
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:14,326
He proved it to me today

487
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:17,306
that he no longer
believes in our cause.

488
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,952
Maybe...

489
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,082
he never did.

490
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,541
Behrooz...

491
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:31,426
Behrooz... Behrooz...

492
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:31,864
Oh, my God.

493
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:34,965
Oh, my God.

494
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:50,148
Secretary Heller would
like to say a few words.

495
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:06,492
I'm incredibly privileged

496
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:09,423
to have the finest people
in the world behind me.

497
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:10,837
All of you.

498
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,239
It's going to take a
lot more than a few words

499
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,346
to express my
feelings, but for now,

500
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:21,371
from the bottom of
my heart, thank you.

501
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,344
Secretary Heller, Curtis
Manning, head of Tactical.

502
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:24,888
Curtis.

503
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:26,814
An honor, sir.

504
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,233
Please, sit down.

505
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:38,599
Erin, my daughter and
I owe you our lives.

506
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:41,669
It sounds like you had
to make some tough calls,

507
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,973
but you made the right ones.

508
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:45,472
I'll see to it that you get

509
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,781
full recognition for a job

510
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:49,858
exceptionally well done.

511
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:55,359
Thank you, sir.

512
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:57,885
Now, before we
start the debriefing,

513
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,118
I'd like to visit with my son.

514
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,926
Where is he?

515
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:04,804
We're actually holding
Richard here, sir.

516
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,831
Why is that?

517
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:09,705
When we brought Richard
in, we gave him a polygraph.

518
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:11,386
It indicated that
he was possibly

519
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,431
withholding
information from us.

520
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:16,032
About my kidnapping?

521
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:17,672
My son and I have

522
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,714
wildly different political views,

523
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:22,623
but I can't believe
that he was involved.

524
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:25,299
We don't think he had
knowing participation,

525
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:26,953
but we believe he
shared knowledge

526
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,009
of your whereabouts this
morning with someone,

527
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,163
and he refuses to
divulge their information

528
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,745
or their identity.

529
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:35,696
And what are you
doing about that?

530
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,966
We discussed a
number of options.

531
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,818
You have to understand
the circumstances.

532
00:27:39,818 --> 00:27:42,328
Stop BS'ing me. What
did you do to him?

533
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,424
There's a technique
that's noninvasive

534
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:45,808
called sensory disorientation.

535
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:49,396
You subjected my son to SDT?

536
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:49,892
Yes, sir, we did.

537
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,565
But it was stopped the moment

538
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:54,102
- you were rescued.
- Jack, did you know about this?

539
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:54,852
No, sir.

540
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:57,085
I want to see my son now.

541
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:58,135
Of course.

542
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,139
Curtis.

543
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,041
Erin, I realize

544
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:04,004
you've been under a lot of
pressure these past few hours,

545
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:06,538
but you better have
cause for this.

546
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:12,699
Jack?

547
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:16,413
I appreciate you not
involving the Secretary

548
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:17,495
in the differences you and I had

549
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,992
on this operation.

550
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:21,268
We both did what we
thought was right, Erin.

551
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,729
I'd like to put the
past behind us, Jack.

552
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:25,556
I could use your help.

553
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,589
What do you need?

554
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:28,823
I'd like you to function

555
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:30,703
in Ronnie's position
as head of Field Ops

556
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:33,371
until we avert this crisis.

557
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:35,274
Whatever I can do to help.

558
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:37,354
Let me make one thing clear.

559
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,904
Ronnie was under my command,
and you will be, too.

560
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:44,355
Understood.

561
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,778
The photos from
the warehouse-

562
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:48,554
are they ready for
Audrey Raines to see?

563
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:49,821
I believe so.

564
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:51,076
I'll have Edgar

565
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,617
port them to a workstation.

566
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:53,896
Okay. Thank you.

567
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,438
Dad.

568
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:06,168
They said you were okay.

569
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:09,426
Audrey, too. Thank God.

570
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:20,822
I said some awf...
awful things before.

571
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,978
I was afraid I'd never
get a chance to apologize.

572
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:26,883
I said some pretty
harsh things myself.

573
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,284
But, no matter what was
said, you're still my son,

574
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,947
and I will always love you.

575
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:33,897
Me, too, Dad.

576
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:44,962
They said they were
using some interrogation

577
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:45,712
techniques.

578
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:46,872
They were totally out of line.

579
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:49,713
I am going to sue them blind.

580
00:29:49,713 --> 00:29:51,136
I think it'll be a little more

581
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:53,814
effective if you
let me deal with it.

582
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:59,171
I promise you, if they were
out of line, heads will roll.

583
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:01,916
What do you mean, "if"?

584
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:04,159
Why did they think

585
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,911
you were holding
something back from them?

586
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:09,368
I don't know.

587
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:12,394
Richard, if you know something

588
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,375
that would shed some light
on what happened to me...

589
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,906
What, you don't think
I would tell them

590
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:17,783
if I thought it was relevant?

591
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,997
So there is something?

592
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:22,594
Now you're giving
me the third degree?

593
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:27,183
Son, do you have any idea what
your sister just went through?

594
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:28,782
If you know anything

595
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:31,091
that would help us find
the people behind this,

596
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:32,946
tell me now.

597
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:36,062
Dad...

598
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,596
I'm glad you're alive.

599
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:38,751
I... I really am.

600
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:41,252
But I am not going
to tell these people

601
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:42,642
things about my private life

602
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:43,943
that they don't need to know.

603
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:47,109
That you don't think
they need to know.

604
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:50,406
Richard, these people
were trying to save

605
00:30:50,406 --> 00:30:51,792
our lives!

606
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:54,335
These people can't be trusted!

607
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,749
What they did to me is proof.

608
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:05,562
Agent Manning, could
you come in here, please?

609
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,777
Agent Manning,

610
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:16,856
I am authorizing
you to do whatever

611
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:18,839
you feel is necessary

612
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,871
to get this information

613
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:23,727
out of my son. Dad...

614
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:24,862
I love you, son,

615
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:28,508
but I have a duty
to my country.

616
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:30,421
You can't be serious.

617
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,495
Dad!

618
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,602
Bring the shovels from the back.

619
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:29,971
Come on. Help me.

620
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:10,108
They said it was
okay to come in.

621
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,228
Hi, Paul.

622
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:18,527
My God, I was so worried.

623
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,803
Are you hurt?

624
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,432
No, just some
cuts and scrapes,

625
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:25,027
nothing serious.

626
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:25,973
Sure?

627
00:33:25,973 --> 00:33:28,534
Yeah, really. I'm okay, Paul.

628
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:30,826
They've okayed me
for my debriefing.

629
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,308
On the flight over,

630
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:47,866
I couldn't stop
thinking about us.

631
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:51,793
How when we
separated we said that

632
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,468
we'd both take
time to figure out

633
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:56,993
what we wanted and...

634
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:58,877
now I know.

635
00:33:58,877 --> 00:33:59,571
Paul.

636
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,879
I want us to be together again.

637
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:03,892
I'm ready to work at it.

638
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:08,469
I'll make our marriage
first priority.

639
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:15,884
Just give us a chance.

640
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:19,811
I'm sorry, Paul.

641
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:23,488
That's not what I want.

642
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:26,253
Audrey, I...

643
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:29,547
I am a fool for
bringing this up now.

644
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:31,469
You can't make decisions
about our relationship

645
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,289
when you're in
this state. Paul.

646
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,889
I'm seeing someone.

647
00:34:49,263 --> 00:34:51,777
Well, how long has
this been going on?

648
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,735
Six months.

649
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:58,547
You love him, or...?

650
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:00,355
Yes.

651
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:03,989
Audrey?

652
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:05,805
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

653
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:07,339
I'll come back later.

654
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,719
No. Um...

655
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,543
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

656
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:15,524
Nice to meet you.

657
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:18,234
You're the one that
saved Audrey's life.

658
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,286
Thank you.

659
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:25,881
You're welcome.

660
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,487
Those photos are ready
for you to look at.

661
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:29,981
Okay.

662
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:32,681
Um, Paul, we'll talk later?

663
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:34,807
Yeah.

664
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:56,084
You all right?

665
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,767
Yeah.

666
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,357
You ready to go?

667
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,082
Not yet.

668
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,697
Now i am.

669
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,443
No.

670
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:57,458
- No.
- You're absolutely certain you saw

671
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,416
this guy before the compound.
Positive, and I could

672
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,455
- tell that he recognized me.
- Okay.

673
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:03,925
No.

674
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:06,423
No.

675
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:07,608
That's all of them.

676
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:10,606
He must have gotten
out before the rescue.

677
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,247
Okay, we should go
through the pictures again

678
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:13,372
just to make sure.

679
00:37:13,372 --> 00:37:14,748
I will, but there
are only two men here

680
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:15,475
who aren't Middle Eastern,

681
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:17,402
and neither one of them are him.

682
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:24,708
What?

683
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:27,155
I just remembered
where I saw him before.

684
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:28,079
Where?

685
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,889
There was a Heritage
Foundation dinner

686
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:31,076
about two months ago,

687
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:32,552
at the Hyatt downtown, here.

688
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:33,625
Do you remember his name?

689
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,538
No, but I know someone
at the foundation.

690
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:36,455
Maybe I can get the guest list.

691
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,477
- Okay, good.
- Agent Bauer?

692
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:39,243
Driscoll wants you in

693
00:37:39,243 --> 00:37:41,031
a conference call that's
starting in a few minutes.

694
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,553
Okay, fine. I need
you to get ahold

695
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,456
of the Hyatt hotel
security department.

696
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:46,483
Get access to their
archival video surveillance.

697
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:47,809
Audrey will give you
a time and a date.

698
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,945
Set a parameter, keep
Driscoll informed.

699
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:51,322
I'll be right back.

700
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:13,846
It's hot.

701
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:51,017
You brought me here
to kill me! Why?!

702
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:58,409
Why are you doing this?!

703
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,964
I did everything
they told me to do.

704
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,341
You know why.

705
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,537
I took care of the
girl. Madwan knows!

706
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:07,461
It's not Madwan
that wants you dead.

707
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:09,484
Who wants me dead?

708
00:39:10,285 --> 00:39:11,641
Who?!

709
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:18,355
Who wants me dead?

710
00:39:19,142 --> 00:39:21,923
I want to know! Tell me!

711
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,966
Your father.

712
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:28,797
No!

713
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:30,129
No!

714
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:31,717
It's not true!

715
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:34,058
No! No!

716
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:57,014
Please!

717
00:39:57,983 --> 00:39:58,884
Please!

718
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,555
No!

719
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:10,936
Mr. Reese,

720
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:13,582
I'm Erin Driscoll, Director
of CTU Los Angeles.

721
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:15,631
My colleagues Curtis
Manning and Sarah Gavin

722
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:16,828
are also present.

723
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,867
Also, Jack Bauer who's Special
Advisor to Secretary Heller.

724
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:21,109
Ms. Driscoll, I
hope you understand.

725
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:22,308
We at McLennen-Forster

726
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,971
couldn't give you details about
that case until we received

727
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,552
the appropriate
permission from DOD.

728
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:27,517
Understood, Mr. Reese.

729
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:28,844
May we please begin?

730
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,788
What was your
courier transporting?

731
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,304
It's a device we developed

732
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,795
under the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's

733
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:35,533
Emergency Management Program.

734
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,333
It's a Dobson-type override.

735
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:40,295
What exactly does
this override do?

736
00:40:40,295 --> 00:40:42,357
It's a combination of
hardware and software

737
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,249
that can remotely take control
of a nuclear power facility.

738
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:48,302
Under what circumstances
would the override be used?

739
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:50,008
The government wanted
to be able to control

740
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:51,403
a plant's nuclear pile

741
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:53,846
in the event of a disaster
that necessitated evacuation.

742
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:54,761
And the person

743
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:55,827
in possession of this program,

744
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,472
could they do the opposite
with it, create a disaster

745
00:40:58,473 --> 00:40:59,729
at a plant, a meltdown?

746
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:00,898
Theoretically, yes.

747
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:02,812
But merely having
possession of the override

748
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:04,543
wouldn't be enough. There
are safeguards in place.

749
00:41:04,543 --> 00:41:05,849
What kind of safeguards?

750
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:07,481
Anyone who's trying
to use the override

751
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,957
would have to hack through
the reactor's firewall.

752
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:12,171
That would take
massive computer power,

753
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:14,429
which NRC could see
coming a mile away.

754
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,589
Is it possible that
NRC could miss this

755
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:19,899
due to unusually heavy
traffic on the Internet?

756
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:20,766
I don't follow.

757
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:22,082
Well, less than an hour ago,

758
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:23,614
millions of computers
around the world

759
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:24,688
were streaming the trial

760
00:41:24,688 --> 00:41:26,653
of the Secretary of Defense.

761
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,067
Is it possible that this trial

762
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:30,835
was just some kind
of a Trojan horse

763
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:31,846
to disguise a massive attack

764
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:34,842
on nuclear power
plants' firewalls?

765
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,066
That might be possible.

766
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,281
How many nuclear power
plants in this country

767
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:39,897
would be vulnerable?

768
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:42,269
All of them.

769
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:44,472
How many is that?

770
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:45,176
At this time,

771
00:41:45,176 --> 00:41:48,484
the United States has 104
nuclear power plants online.

772
00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:50,492
We have to assume that
they've used this override

773
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:51,459
to take over these plants.

774
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:52,483
Get me NRC now

775
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:53,824
and find Secretary Heller.

776
00:41:53,824 --> 00:41:55,161
Thank you, Mr. Reese.

777
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:56,699
Set up an all-department briefing.

778
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:57,692
Get me NRC, now.

779
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:58,689
Pipe it through here.

780
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:01,629
I want all personnel
in the conference area.

781
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:03,843
Edgar...

782
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:05,365
can you monitor my
allocation tables

783
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:06,647
for a few minutes?

784
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:07,951
Sure.

785
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,145
Yes?

786
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:33,311
It's me.

787
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:34,399
You're on a secure line?

788
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:35,261
Yes.

789
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,445
I would've checked in sooner.

790
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,255
This was the first chance I got.

791
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,575
All right. Go on.

792
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:42,322
They find out about the override.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
