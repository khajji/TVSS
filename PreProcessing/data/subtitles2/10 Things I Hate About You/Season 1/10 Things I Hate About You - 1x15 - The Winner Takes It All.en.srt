00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,513
<i>Again!</i>

5
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:13,252
Dad, you want to hear my
oral report on Sacagawea?

6
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:15,381
<i>[Dr. Stratford] In a minute, Kat.
Your sister's singing.</i>

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,847
Fine, I'll go eat some candy.

8
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:20,510
Again.

9
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:22,843
Oh, I'm so cute.

10
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:26,179
Dakota Fanning,
eat your heart out.

11
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:29,182
There. There's the moment
I knew you had a gift.

12
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,184
Ooh, look, home movies.

13
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:33,519
Let me guess--
It's talent show season?

14
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:35,855
Yes, and I'm on
pins and needles.

15
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,356
What are you
going to sing this year?

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,592
I don't know. Pop music
is in a state of flux.

17
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:43,061
Am I a Taylor, a Miley,
a Leona?

18
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:44,529
How about a Lady Gag-Me?

19
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,798
It's Gaga.
Really?

20
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,634
I know I'm biased, but I don't know
how you're going to top last year.

21
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:51,069
Thanks, Daddy.

22
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:53,037
Yeah, I actually believed
you kissed a girl and liked it.

23
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:56,340
That's why your sister
got two standing ovations.

24
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,343
Yeah, but all I won
was a stupid trophy.

25
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:03,813
<i>This year, the winner gets a walk-on
role on Make It or Break It.</i>

26
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,715
How can you not love
California?

27
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:08,884
<i>Make It or Break It?
What's that?</i>

28
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,486
It's television's
number one drama,

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,221
set in the world
of competitive gymnastics.

30
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:14,889
I'll set my TiVo.

31
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:18,159
So Dad, I need some help
on something important.

32
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,394
Will you proofread this letter
to the editor of the paper?

33
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:24,131
That depends. Do you promise to
agree to disagree about semicolons?

34
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:25,766
I promise.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,501
But first, will you sign my
permission slip for the talent show?

36
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:29,969
With pleasure.

37
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:41,346

38
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:44,450
Really? You're dancing?
I never knew you could dance.

39
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:46,585
Yup. Check this out.

Hey!
Cool, huh?

42
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:56,495
It's called the kalinka.

43
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,130
And why exactly
are you doing that?

44
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:00,865
<i>To make my bubonia proud.</i>

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,100
That's what we call my grandmother.
She's Russian.

46
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:04,968
But don't worry,

47
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,837
she's a cool Russian,
not one of the scary ones.

48
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,875
That guy's a weirdo.

49
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,208
Of course he is.
He's dating my sister,

50
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,809
whose impressive karaoke skills
will probably score her

51
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:19,811
three seconds of face time on
TV's number one gymnastics drama,

52
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:22,614
making her even more
impossible to be around.

53
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,549
Someone's jealous.

54
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,152
Me, jealous of Bianca?
That's stupid. You're stupid.

55
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:31,155
Hey, Kat,
can I borrow your pen?

56
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,824
Oh-ho, what do you think?

57
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,159
I'm practicing
for the talent show.

58
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,895
Thus, my practice cape.

59
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,863
Didn't even know he did magic.

60
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:41,864
Impressive.

61
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,665
Oh, it runs in my blood.

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,436
My gay uncle had a show off-Strip
in Vegas called Abracafabulous.

63
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,772
He's teaching me all his secrets
while he's sleeping on our couch.

64
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,774
Wait till you see
my guillotine trick.

65
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,209
You will lose your heads.

66
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,377
You get it?

67
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,113
'Cause of the guillotine.

68
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,649
Okay. Bye, scary people.

69
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,120
Poor kid.

70
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,888
It's like middle school
all over again.

71
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,123
Ooh, what happened?
I love origin stories.

72
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:16,793
He was singing My Girl" on stage
at this stupid concert choir thing

73
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:22,131
when, uh-- Let's just
say he became aroused.

74
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:25,467
Oh, poor guy.

75
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,802
Is that why people call him--
Spoink.

76
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:30,504
Yup. I came up with it.

77
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:37,410
Dad, check out the paper.

78
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:38,811
They printed your letter?

79
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:41,147
Not only did they print it,
they changed their policy

80
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,515
and are now publishing
same-sex wedding announcements.

81
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,750
Anyone we know?

82
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:47,252
Can you stand there
and hold up the paper?

83
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:48,920
Dad, don't tape this.

84
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:51,255
I'm just checking out the zoom on
this new camera. It's amazing.

85
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,924
We'll practically
be on stage with Bianca.

86
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:00,930
So I have a little
announcement to make.

87
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,865
I have picked my song
for the talent show.

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,933
Pause for dramatic effect.

89
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,467
"Kids in America."

90
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,768
That's perfect. You're a kid,

91
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,236
and who doesn't love
the word America?

92
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,303
This is so exciting.

93
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,905
What are you going to wear?

94
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,942
I was thinking of going for
a retro Pat Benatar-ish vibe--

95
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:18,144
Oh, you're mocking me.

96
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:21,849
Just for that, don't expect to be
thanked in my acceptance speech.

97
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,451
How are you so sure
you're going to win?

98
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,119
It's called the power
of positive thinking.

99
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:26,287
Plus, I always win.

100
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,122
Bianca, watch it.

101
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:29,290
It's just a newspaper.

102
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:30,624
I'll pick up
more copies at work.

103
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,425
Bianca, let's hear some scales.

104
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:36,760
[sings]

105
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,628
[Bianca and Dr. Stratford]
Again!

106
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,930
[sings]

107
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:52,073
Cameron, please tell me your magic
act is going to be amazing.

108
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,574
Abracafabulous is no more.

109
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:56,409
Michael quit as my assistant.

110
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:58,078
It seems he doesn't trust
these steady hands

111
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:00,079
to work a trick guillotine.

112
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:04,083
But your uncle entrusted you with
the secrets of his gay magic.

113
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:07,085
It's not gay magic.
There's just a lot of rhinestones.

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,254
Help me convince Cameron
not to quit the talent show.

115
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,254
Don't quit.

116
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,423
Everybody loves a dark horse,

117
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:13,758
and you're as dark as they get.

118
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,159
You could win.

119
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:16,760
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

120
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:18,262
I can't cut off my own head.

121
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,864
Fine, I'll be your assistant.

122
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,367
What's so funny?

123
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,203
Uh, I'm sorry.
It's no offense.

124
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,104
It's just-- You don't seem
like an assistant.

125
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,372
You seem more like a boss.

126
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:32,607
I'm just trying to help you out.
Sure you are.

127
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,442
He deserves to win.

128
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,444
I want people to stop
calling him Spoink.

129
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,612
They still call me that?

130
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:39,946
It wasn't my fault.

131
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:42,048
It was the unfortunate
convergence

132
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:44,116
of puberty and corduroy pants.

133
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:47,452
This is your chance
to live that down.

134
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,287
No pun intended.
Shut up.

135
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:51,056
Let's do a kick-ass
magic show.

136
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,624
Okay. Alakazam.

137
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,058
Let's start with the basics.

138
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,260
What do you know
about trap doors?

139
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,763
Talk to me.
Uh, nothing.

140
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,067
You still taking bets
on the talent show?

141
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,736
Uh, Chastity's the favorite,

142
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,406
but people are saying that new blond
chick might make this interesting.

143
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,077
I'll put 50 down
on Cameron James.

144
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,412
Spoink?

145
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:17,613
It's your funeral, Verona.

146
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:28,089
Honey, do you have to wear
that hat everywhere we go?

147
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:31,091
Yeah, 'cause I'm
rehearsing in my head.

148
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,093
I can't wait
to get on that stage.

149
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,094
This is going to be
my chance to show Chastity

150
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,429
I'm not just
her little sidekick.

151
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,097
In fact, after I win
the talent show,

152
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,099
maybe I'll get my own sidekick.

153
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,366
Cool. Circle of life.

154
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,436
"Everybody live for the music"

155
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,437
Oh, my God.

156
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,339
Do you hear that?

157
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,375
Yeah. Chastity sounds
like a robot,

158
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,876
but at least
she's on-key for once.

159
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:58,180
Because she's using an auto
tuner to sing my song.

160
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,716
Okay, boys,
keep working on that.

161
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,051
<i>And butch it up.
This isn't Pippin.</i>

162
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:05,052
Hey. Impressive, right?

163
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:07,921
We still have to work out
the confetti cannons.

164
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:10,123
Chastity, that's my song.

165
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:12,058
Oh, really? Did you write it?

166
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,060
No, but I wrote it
on the sign-up sheet,

167
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:16,062
and I signed up before you did,

168
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:18,297
which means I called it first.

169
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:19,398
You can still sing it.

170
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,733
You're scheduled
to go on after me,

171
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,368
so it'll make a nice reprise.

172
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,069
Or if you need a new routine,

173
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:29,040
just slap on a babushka and toss
some plates on the floor with Joey.

174
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,408
Nice, Chastity.
That shows how much you know.

175
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,076
Russians don't throw
plates on the floor.

176
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,744
We wear tall black boots

177
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:37,947
and go hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

178
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,883
Okay, now that's talent
right there. Yeah.

179
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,819
He's not the one singing
through a computer, R2D-Tune.

180
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,688
Oh, I can sing, okay?

181
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:51,023
It's just the sound
of contemporary pop music.

182
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:55,193
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've
got a showstopper to perfect.

183
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:56,294
<i>"["Kids in America"]</i>

184
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,697
And five, six, seven, eight.

185
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,033
"We're the kids of America

186
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,201
"Oh

187
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,736
"We're the kids of America"

188
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,371
Sometimes, I miss Ohio.

189
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,817
Surprised to see you here.

190
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,019
I would have thought
you'd have graduated by now.

191
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,687
I'm just here to support
your daughter.

192
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,423
Doesn't Bianca have her own
boyfriend to support her?

193
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:21,791
Not that I like that.

194
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,159
No, I'm here for Kat.

195
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,528
You didn't know?
She's in the show.

196
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,029
She would never.

197
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:32,099
She would.
In a sexy dress, no less.

198
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,800
Oh, does that thing have zoom?

199
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:37,171
I get it.
You're punking me again.

200
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:40,807
Kat Stratford.

201
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,709
See? I can read.

202
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,210
Why would Kat enter
a talent show?

203
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,145
Do they want to adopt
a whale or something?

204
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:50,982
My theory? She's jealous.

205
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:52,717
She's jealous? Of whom?

206
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,856
Oh, dear.

207
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,258
This is going to be good.

208
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:13,002
Welcome to the Padua High
talent show.

209
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,404
Before we begin, a reminder--

210
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:18,073
If your phone rings,
it will be confiscated,

211
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:24,079
and I need a new one,
so go ahead, make my day.

212
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,750
Next year, I'm writing
my own material.

213
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:34,623
Please welcome Allen
Griswold on the accordion.

214
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:46,936
You're up next.

215
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,138
Where's your sidekick?

216
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:59,772
Don't leave until I get a photo
of you in that get-up.

217
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,107
I can't do this.

218
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:05,109
Let's go home. I'll make
slice and bake cookies.

219
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:06,444
No, we're not going anywhere.

220
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,112
You're the one
who wanted to do this.

221
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,447
I wanted to impress people
with Abracafabulous,

222
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:12,717
but every time I think
of the word wand"...

223
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,786
Cameron, our show is great.

224
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:18,554
This is your moment.

225
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,422
If you get nervous,
just picture

226
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:22,123
the entire audience in their...

227
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:23,724
Winter ski gear.

228
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,462
Crack, you stupid whip.

229
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,263
How does Britney Spears
do this while singing?

230
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,130
Just do your best.

231
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,664
<i>I can't believe my bubonia is
going to see you in that outfit.</i>

232
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,634
Oh, hey, Cameron.
You look abracafabulous.

233
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,068
Thanks, Bianca.

234
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,169
You look...

235
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:46,339
Like you're ready
to hit the slopes.

236
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:51,079
Kat, what are you doing here,

237
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:54,616
and why are you dressed
like Miss Scarlet from Clue?

238
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,084
I'm in the show with Cameron.

239
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:59,752
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to go double-check the guillotine.

240
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:01,687
Break a leg.

241
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,457
[whip cracks] Ouch!

242
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,765
All rightie.

243
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,800
Thank you for getting--

244
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,805
Thank you for getting the show
off to such a rousing start.

245
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,873
And now, for our second act
of the evening,

246
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:28,075
Cameron James, master of magic.

247
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:35,781
Ladies and gentlemen--

248
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:39,117
[Boy] Spoink!
[audience laughs]

249
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:42,386
Prepare to be amazed.

250
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:44,722
Straight from
the back streets of Vegas,

251
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:48,724
I bring you Abracafabulous.

252
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,728
But no great magician
would be complete

253
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,629
without his beautiful
assistant.

254
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,565
Please welcome Katerina.

255
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,168
[audience claps, whistles]

256
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,006
Katerina, you may come out
of the magic box.

257
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,575
Katerina...

258
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,943
Get out of the magic box.

259
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:15,412
Ruh-roh.

260
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:18,081
Please tell me this is
part of the act.

261
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:21,083
Perhaps she will
easily come out

262
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:23,285
with the use of my magic cane.

263
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,621
This is not good.

264
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:32,860
Chastity, there's a problem
with your auto-tuner.

265
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:33,927
What kind of problem?

266
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,995
It's broken.

267
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,431
Broken? It can't be broken.
Let me take a look at it.

268
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,567
You probably just can't
figure out how to turn it on.

269
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:45,704
If there's anything I know,
it's how to turn things on.

270
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,240
I hate working
with you amateurs.

271
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,844
Excuse me, tech guy,

272
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,814
is it too late to go back
to my old song?

273
00:12:56,848 --> 00:13:02,351
Katerina, please lower thyself
into this mysterious chest.

274
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:08,689
The show must go on.

275
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,395
This chest always has been
a problem for me.

276
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,965
It seems to have
quite the appetite.

277
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,931
Thank you.

278
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,300
Not to worry.

279
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:30,836
My lady Katerina is only
trapped between realms.

280
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:47,880
Katerina?
Quit messing around.

281
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,676
Mom, don't worry about it.
I can still sing the song.

282
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,077
No, you can't.

283
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:01,712
That's why I spent $700
on an auto-tuner.

284
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:04,181
But you said it was the sound
of contemporary pop music.

285
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:06,950
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it.
I was being a good mother.

286
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,784
What are we going to do?
My friends are out there.

287
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:10,118
I told them you were
going to win.

288
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,053
I might still win.

289
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:15,289
Sweetie, mothers don't let
daughters embarrass themselves.

290
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:19,594
Just fake some sort of illness
and meet me at the car.

291
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,301
Listen, Chastity,

292
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,036
as long as you're insisting
on stealing my song,

293
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,704
maybe we should just
sing it together.

294
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,874
Otherwise, we'll just cancel each other
out, and neither of us will win.

295
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,146
You mean like a duet?

296
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,247
Why not?

297
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,182
It's not called
"Kid in America."

00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:45,290
Oh, my God, you were awesome.

325
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:47,958
I know. My mom can eat it.

326
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,293
You totally inspired me
to greatness, bestie.

327
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:53,294
If we win that walk-on role, I'm
going to let you walk on first.

328
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,629
Excuse you.

329
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:56,631
I'm not going back out there.
Oh yes, you are.

330
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,798
I've got 50 bucks riding
on you that I don't have.

331
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,966
You shouldn't have bet on me.
Don't you know it's illegal?

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,301
Do it for yourself, Spoink.
Hey!

333
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:06,637
Look, all those kids out there
already think you're a loser.

334
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:07,838
You want to prove them right?

335
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,341
Did you just
give me a pep talk?

336
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:22,984
Hello again, folks.

337
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:28,323
I just came out to get my pen.

I'm glad I found you here. I was worried you
were trapped in an alternate dimension.

00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,484
Here.

354
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,652
This will help with the nausea,

355
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:33,187
but it won't help
with the shame.

356
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:35,656
How do you get up
on stage like that?

357
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,991
You make it look so easy.

358
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,460
I don't practice
just to annoy you.

359
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,061
I work my ass off.

360
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:43,363
Plus, it helps,
being pretty and talented.

361
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:46,967
Well, I suck. I was worse
than the one-man band.

362
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,470
Yeah, you were.

363
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,941
Luckily, you're good
at other things,

364
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:58,212
like getting A"s and recycling,

365
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:01,047
and making people feel so bad
that they do something good.

366
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,284
Yeah, but when I do those
things, people don't applaud,

367
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,821
and Dad has never worn a stupid
t-shirt with my name on it.

368
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,889
Oh, my God.

369
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,991
You just admitted
you're jealous of me.

370
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,860
Can I capture
this moment on my phone?

371
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:15,728
I want
Youtube-uploadable proof.

372
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,300
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

373
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,170
I sometimes wish
I had your hair.

Everyone loves an underdog.

Now, as the judges
make their final decisions,

384
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:14,451
will all the contestants
join me on stage?

Everyone.

00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:07,599
And the winner of the Padua
High talent show is...

387
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:19,339
Wow. She's good.

388
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:21,508
I know. I hate her already.
