Hate About You...

2
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:04,634
We did not get a chance
to officially meet.

3
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:07,347
- Kat Stratford.
- William Blankenship.

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,651
So it's theoretically possible

5
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:10,994
that you could be interested
in someone besides me?

6
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:13,342
Yes, if she wasn't
just a theoretical person.

7
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:15,718
Your mother was the love of my life,

8
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:18,765
and after she died,
I never thought I'd want
to meet someone again,

9
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,377
but just that little spark
of anticipation

10
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,419
made me realize life goes on.

11
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,394
You betrayed me.

It's not personal,
it's just politics.

13

One day, Brangelina
will be obsolete,

14
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:38,107
and all of your diligent
studying will have been
for naught.

15
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,814
That's a fancy word
for nothing.

16
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,134
You're welcome.

17
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:49,144
Thanks. For transferring
out of the school?

18
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:50,817
I have two tickets
I can't use

19
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,160
for the Andrecorso's
art opening tonight,
Mad Cow Fire.

20
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:57,839
It was denied federal funding
for being--
Too controversial.

21
00:00:57,873 --> 00:00:59,845
I'm dying to see it.

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,117
Wait. I don't like you.

23
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:04,459
You can't still be upset
about meatless Mondays.

24
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:06,129
That was two weeks ago.

25
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,471
What if I reluctantly,
yet sincerely, begged
for your forgiveness?

26
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:11,913
Mm, sorry. I'm not charmed
by the Masterpiece Theater act.

27
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,387
Jack the Ripper had
a British accent, too.

28
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:15,490
You honestly find me
that awful?

29
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:16,960
I think you should
be deported,

30
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,465
and if I didn't have
such strong reservations

31
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,837
about the INS,
I would report you.

32
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,514
All rightie then.
Pleasure as-- Well, never.

33
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,684
Fine.

34
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,187
I'll take them
off your hands.

35
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,189
Thanks.

36
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:29,427
You can go.

Hey.
Hey back.

this cool modern art show
tonight?

39
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,550
Let me think for a second.

40
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,220
Spend a night
staring at blobs of paint,

41
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:41,724
pretending they don't
look like bird crap.

Ah, but this is different.

Some of his paintings
are made with bird droppings.

to the French club's

I think it's Saturday at 7,
but I'm not sure,

48

selling the tickets
only spoke French.

No, you do not.

Dawn just broke up witMax.

61

We can all go together,
and if the movie's lame,
we can leave together.

No, not like that. Ew.

hanging out together in, like,

Sorry, Bianca.

Plus, what else
are you going to do?

81
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,209
All that's on TV are shows
about people who want to dance

with overly tan celebrities.

But what if Cameron
thinks this is a date

84
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,717
and falls in love with me?

85

Just watching you
go through that
was so annoying.

He won't. I'll make sure of it.

Well, that was bloody awful.

158
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,851
You seriously think
a show like that deserves
government funding?

159
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,520
Just because we thought
it was crappy, pun intended,

160
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:57,855
doesn't mean it shouldn't
be supported.

161
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,291
Maybe he's ahead of his time,
like Van Gogh.

162
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,125
Oh, it's Van Gogh.

163
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,794
But if art is subjective,
then it should be driven
by the marketplace.

164
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,128
<i>So based on that logic,
last year's best film
was, what, The Hangover?</i>

165
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,462
Oh, it's up there.

166
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,330
Come on, the naked guy
in the trunk? Amazing.

167
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,132
Tonight was fun, right?

168
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,467
Yeah, shockingly.

169
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,335
How about a proper date?

170
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:21,971
What?

171
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,138
I'll pick you up.

172
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:25,507
You'll wear your good jeans.

173
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,808
I'll offend you
by opening the door,

174
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:28,376
you'll lecture me
on women's rights,

175
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,977
so I'll let you
pick up the check.

176
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,480
As enticing as that sounds,
I can't.

177
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,714
I'm seeing someone.

178
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:35,482
The motorcycle chap?

179
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,883
He's your boyfriend?

180
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,186
We don't feel the need
to label everything.

181
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,723
So does that mean that
you and your non-boyfriend
can see other people?

182
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:48,159
No, I think.

183
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:51,361
Look, I just can't
go a date with you, okay?
It's complicated.

184
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:55,064
Well, if it ever gets
uncomplicated, let me know.

185
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:05,440
So I'm prepping for
our make-out-a-thon.

186
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:07,441
I've been eating
eucalyptus leaves, parsley,

187
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,944
and last night, my mom made
garlic toast, my fave,

188
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,945
and all I did was smell it.

189
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,781
Joey, that's so sweet.
I can't wait to make out
with you for three hours.

190
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,783
I know. Me too.
And fingers crossed,

191
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,452
we'll be able to reach
a legendary kissers' high.

192
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,454
What's that?
Oh, Bianca.

193
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,122
When you're kissing that long,

194
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:24,456
you're breathing in
each other's air

195
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,792
and your brain goes into
this sparkly Zen place

196
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:29,694
and you feel like
you're floating above
and looking down at yourself.

197
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,862
Joey, are you sure
that's not astral projecting?

198
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,397
No, that's when you have
a sexy dream.

199
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,136
Hey, Bianca,
the mantra is working.

200
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,139
Last night, I had the urge
to call Dawn, but I didn't.

201
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,473
At least not on a real phone.

202
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,808
Nice self-control.

203
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,809
And then she sat
next to me in study hall.

204
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:49,511
Don't worry, coach.

205
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,912
Every time I almost said

206
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,480
"I want to live in your hair

207
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:55,782
"and vacation on the tippy tip
of your cute little nose,"

208
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,784
I did my mantra in my head--

209
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:00,753
These are not
feelings of love--

210
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,521
And then said normal stuff.

211
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:04,089
Yay. Go us.
Yeah.

212
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:06,091
Hi, guys.

213
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,259
Cameron, wear blue tomorrow.
It'll make your eyes
jump off your face.

214
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:11,562
And try to style your hair
like Jake Gyllenhaal,
with that swoosh thing.

215
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:14,765
Sure, if I got time.

216
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,032
Why don't I do it for you?

217
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,434
Let me see what I'm
working with.

218
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:18,635
Down.

219
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,770
You need product.

220
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:22,805
Come on. Got some mousse
in my locker.

221
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,476
These are not feelings of love.
These are not feelings of love.

222
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,779
Hey, Patrick.

223
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,113
How lame was the art show?

224
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,781
Not lame at all, actually.

225
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:37,150
His work has
this savagery to it
that's really primal.

226
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,784
Sounds kinky.

227
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,119
Blank was there.

228
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:41,787
Blank. Stupid name.

229
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,457
What, his parents were too lazy
to come up with, like, Bob?

230
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,459
It's a nickname.
His name is William.

231
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,160
Still lame.

232
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,795
It was a weird night.

233
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,129
In addition to the bloody limbs
and severed dolls' heads,

234
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:54,997
he asked me out.

235
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,431
Oh, yeah?

236
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,799
Yeah.

237
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,635
I mean, yeah.

238
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,736
So what did you say?

239
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,171
What do you think I said?

240
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,139
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

241
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,474
Are you going to go?

242
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,443
Why would I do that?

243
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:10,777
Why wouldn't you?

244
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,314
So you'd have no problem
with me going on a date
with him?

245
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,415
Why would I?

246
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,483
This is a free country.

247
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,951
You remind me of that
all the time.

248
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:19,952
If you want to go, go.

249
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,353
Okay, I will.

250
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,855
Have a nice time.

251
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,056
I plan on it.

252
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,130
May I present
the winning look.

253
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:36,999
Why are you going through
all this trouble for Cameron?

254
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,467
You said he was a nork.

255
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,135
That was before
I got to know him.
That was two days ago.

256
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,470
It feels like forever.

257
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,471
He's so bumbly and funny
and such a good listener.

258
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:47,474
Every time I talk, he stops
to process what I've said.

259
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:49,142
Think how cute
our kids would be--

260
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:51,810
Half-Asian
and the perfect height.

261
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:54,480
Kids? Dawn, you're not
supposed to like Cameron.

262
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,481
You're supposed
to tolerate him, remember?

263
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,817
Yeah, but I could use
a nice boyfriend,

264
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:01,086
especially one who can
pick me up and carry me around.

265
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,787
Just think,
when we go to a concert,

266
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,422
I could finally see
what's going on.

267
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,092
Back up, back way up.

268
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,427
You can't do this to Cameron.

269
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,763
He's fragile and innocent
and vulnerable.

270
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:13,799
Aw, like a sweet
little baby lamb.

271
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,768
No, not like a lamb,
like a boy who will
fall in love with you

272
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,103
and be devastated
when in 24 to 48 hours,

273
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,604
you fall in love
with someone else.

274
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,105
You're right, you're right.

275
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,606
I bet he's never even
kissed a girl.

276
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,108
He hasn't.

277
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,276
Clay Aiken has more experience
with women than he does.

278
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,812
So I'll just have to kiss him
and see if he's the one.

279
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,451
Yeah, I'm just about to watch
some riveting television
about people dancing.

280
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:41,450
Dad, Ms. Tharpe just called.
A chaperone just cancelled.
You're off the wait list.

I can't believe
this many Padua students

are willing to read subtitles.

286
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:57,128
There's not loads
of dialogue in the film.

I mean, has anybody
actually spoken yet?

or not whimsical enough?

292

A tad too whimsical,

293
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,573
especially the way she walks
with one foot on the curb

294

and one foot in the street.

295

She's going to get

but I just have these
tiny little bird wrists.

314
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,723
I'm not being sexist,
just stating a fact.

315
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,358
I'm on it.

316
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,559
Just follow me, this way.

317
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,727
[whimpers]
Oh, boy.

318
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:51,354
Look, Dawn. Paris.

319
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,222
It's so beautiful.

320
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:54,990
We should
go backpacking there.
Dawn, look.

321
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,925
The Eiffel Tower.

322
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:06,365
Okay, I'm going in.

323
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,900
I'll see you in three hours.

324
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:21,378
We should have known.

325
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,112
That this would be
a Roman orgy?

326
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:25,712
Come on, people.
You're in public.

327
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,715
Well, if we can't
beat these hedonists,
I say we--

328
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:30,716
Join them? No, thank you.

329
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,717
This has swine flu
written all over it.

330
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,419
I was going to say
ignore them.

331
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:46,529
Mmm, this is good.

332
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,063
And messy.

333
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:49,531
You've got a little, uh--

334
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:51,633
Chocolate on your--

335
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,106
Thanks.

336
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,502
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

337
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,304
I know, I know.
It's complicated.

338
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,441
Which is ironic, because
Leather Jacket Man
is so simple.

339
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:28,042
What do you mean by that?

340
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:30,677
I'm just guessing here,
but I can't see e two of you

341
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,212
sitting around debatin
off-shore drilling.

342
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:35,482
Look, we debate lots of stuff.

343
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:37,450
Just stop talking about him
fore you--

344
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,852
Before what?

345
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,286
Before I tell you
what you already know?

346
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:42,988
That you're too good for him?

347
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,191
I can't believe you just
said that out loud.

348
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,958
You are such an elitist.

349
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:50,093
You can't tell me the thought
hasn't crossed yr mind.

350
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:55,865
I don't know who I find
more annoying, you or Jolie.

351
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,833
This date is over.

352
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,674
You have to come
to my parents' house
in Laguna this summer.

353
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,810
Oh, I just got accepted
into space camp,

354
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,280
but I can bail.

355
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,148
It's just space.

356
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,484
Oh, Dawn.

357
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,719
I don't remember my life
before we kissed.

358
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:25,589
[coughs]
Mantra.

359
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,991
[coughs]

360
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:30,560
I'll be right back.

361
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:34,831
These are not
feelings of love.

362
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:36,166
These are not
feelings of love.

363
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,834
Female incomin

364
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,669
the re of high school   or you'd

365
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:43,170
daydreaming about living
in some girl's hai

366
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:45,171
Thmantra's not worng.

367
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,505
And you want to know why?

368
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,507
Because these are
feelings of love.

369
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,841
Da's into me.

370
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,242
She invited me to Laguna.

371
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,510
Th's what she es.

372
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,079
She falls in love
every other day,
just like you,

373
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,848
except she'll be
over it morrow
and you won't.

374
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,682
Well, this feels real  me,

375
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:01,351
so I'd appreciate it
if you would butt out.

376
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:08,056
She asked me to proofread
this e-mail she wrote
to Max Morita.

377
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:15,796
Hey, Max, it would be
so awesome if you could
hang at my parents' house

378
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,430
in Laguna this summer.

379
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,965
She wrote that three days ago.

380
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,802
There's a typo.

381
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:25,804
Laguna has one "g,"
just so you know.

382
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,339
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:30,107
I just don't want to see you
get your heart broken.

384
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,176
Thanks.

385
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,519
Wow. Walter,
what a heart-breaking story.

386
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:46,020
Thank you for sharing
your truth with me.

387
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,189
I'm afraid I've over-shared.
Maybe it's the couch,

388
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:52,359
or just that
you're so easy to talk to.

389
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:57,128
I just feel for you.

390
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,431
Raising two teenage girls
by yourself--

391
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:02,635
It just seems really lonely.

392
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,505
I've lost people too, Walter.

393
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,774
My first fiancÃ©e,
he fell overboard

394
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,809
on a booze cruise
in Cozumel.

395
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,779
I'm so sorry.

396
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:19,448
I thought he was dead,
for many years.

397
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:21,483
Then I found him on Facebook.

398
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:27,954
Well, man like that's
bound to fall off
something else.

399
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:34,959
Where do you think
you're going?

400
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:36,160
Patrick?
We're going home.

401
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,797
Well, I guess
congratulations are in order.

402
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:41,300
You're walking on two legs.
Okay--

403
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,135
Why don't you get
on your broom stick

404
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,137
<i>and fly back to whatever
Harry Potter movie
you came from?</i>

405
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,638
Stop it.
I don't want to hurt you.

406
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,672
That's weird, 'cause I want
to hurt you a lot.

407
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,142
Let's go.

408
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:57,814
Are you kidding me?
All right, sorry, guys.

409
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:00,450
Whoever beats the crap
out of each other
does not win me!

410
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,785
Stay away from my girlfriend.

411
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:10,791
Okay, I do have a problem
with you seeing other guys.

412
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:13,093
Good. So we're exclusive.

413
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:14,760
No, I'm going to see
other people.

414
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:15,961
I just don't want you to.

415
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:24,635
You guys just missed Jolie
dancing in a rain puddle.

416
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:29,606
Uh, I feel like
watching the movie now.

417
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,441
Yeah, but I want
to make out.

418
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:35,110
Why don't you make out
with Max Morita?

419
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:36,778
What?

420
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:41,114
Hope the beach house
is big enough for
all the guys you invited.

421
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,449
Bianca, you showed him
my Max e-mail?

422
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,918
I didn't even send that.

423
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,786
I was trying to protect him.

424
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,788
I asked you to back off,
and you wouldn't.

425
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,256
You know what your problem is?

426
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,191
You are too meddling
in Cameron's love life.

427
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,258
I am not.

428
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,060
Yes, you are.
You kind of are.

429
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,862
For your "informash,"
I'm crazy about this guy.

430
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,864
I like him for the reasons
you like him as a friend.

431
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,899
I don't care if you believe it.
It's happening.

432
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,433
Cameron, we're moving.
Pick me up.

433
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:08,671
[Twice]
Okay.

434
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:15,476
What's going on
with you, Fivesies?

435
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:17,244
Why are you obsessing
over them?

436
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,813
It's just weird.

437
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,815
They're my best friends.

438
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:24,150
It's like sixth grade
all over again,

439
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,152
when Jojo Riverton
and Amy Gardella

440
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:30,155
went to Wild Water Kingd
without me.

441
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,122
I know it's not the same,

442
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:35,358
but I'll go
to Wild Water Kingdom with you.

443
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:38,260
I mean, for real.

444
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:39,527
It sounds awesome.
