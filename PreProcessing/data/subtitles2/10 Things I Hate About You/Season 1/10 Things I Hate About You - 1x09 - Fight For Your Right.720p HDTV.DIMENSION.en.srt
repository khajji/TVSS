1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:02,508
It's important to stay
as low as possible...

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,119
because heat rises.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,545
Heat rises.
Did you know that?

4
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:10,408
No, but maybe if he goes over it
another ten times, it'll sink in.

5
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:13,118
Pay attention.
Don't touch that doorknob...

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,432
until you've checked
to see if it's hot first.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,801
What do you know? Look at that.
Room temperature. You can escape now, Dad.

8
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:23,423
Don't wanna be late for the conference.
The other gynecologists will ice you out.

9
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,244
- Time to go, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

10
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,586
- Kat, you're in charge.
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:32,037
- That means you're responsible for Bianca.
- Cool. I get to order you around.

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,487
You know what?
Maybe I'll just skip the conference.

13
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:37,805
What else can I learn? The last time I heard,
babies still come out of the same place.

14
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:41,447
Dad, it's healthy for us to spend time apart
so we don't get sick of each other.

15
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:43,860
I could never be sick
of my little girls.

16
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,062
- Okay. Time to go.
- Well, all right.

17
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,605
- Oh, thank you. Thanks.
- Bye. Love you.

18
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,169
- I'm gonna miss you. Oh, I left--
- Love you so much, Dad.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,573
Have a good time.
Bye-bye.

20
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:59,186
It's finally happening.

21
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:01,934
An entire weekend
without Dad.

22
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,074
- See you Monday.
- Yep.

23
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:15,295
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

24
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,990
Oh, do not sell any
of our furniture on craigslist.

25
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,149
I'm just taking
"before" pictures.

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,635
Before what?

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,813
I'm having a few friends over...

28
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:34,114
and I just wanna make sure
I can replicate the "after".

29
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,140
This is so cliché.

30
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,944
Dad goes out of town,
you throw a wild party...

31
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:41,392
someone breaks
our Fabergé egg, and...

32
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,009
then we have to turn this place
into a brothel to pay for it.

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,592
Sounds like an awesome weekend.

34
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,065
Come in.

35
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:54,545
Hey, Bianca.
We are here for karaoke.

36
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:56,568
Ohh.

37
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:01,694
I know what you're up to.
I've seen those crappy teen movies.

38
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,480
Oh, me, too.

39
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,824
Aren't you supposed to show up
much later wearing a hockey mask?

40
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,832
And you'll be the first to go.

41
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,315
Come on.
This is just karaoke.

42
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:20,617
Let me guess. Some football drones
with beer and a spiked watermelon.

43
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:27,171
* Five, four, three, two, one *

44
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:34,262
It is only 9:30. This party
should totally suck right now.

45
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,462
This is going
better than planned.

46
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:40,441
If this party turns epic,
I could be a legend at Padua High.

47
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:44,815
Shane DeMarco graduated four years ago,
and people are still talking about his party.

48
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,785
Hey, blonde girl,
is this your party?

49
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,890
- Uh, yeah, it is.
- Not bad.

50
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:52,244
Strong hot-guy ratio,
and some are in college.

51
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,942
- Hey, what's up?
- So what's your name?

52
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:57,745
Bianca Stratford.
Tell all your friends.

53
00:02:57,746 --> 00:02:59,038
Okay.

54
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:04,945
- Oh, my God! College guys!
- Shane DeMarco can eat it!

55
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:11,471
Bianca, no more people,
or I'm shutting this place down.

56
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,410
Did you even think
about putting out trash cans?

57
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:16,732
Move!

58
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,903
Come on!
Put your back into it.

59
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:20,996
Whoo!

60
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:25,354
Okay, when my back
wants to touch your front...

61
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,048
I'll tell you.

62
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,396
Joey, sweetie...

63
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,351
- I'm thirsty.
- Me, too.

64
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:39,320
- Oh, I'm on it.
- Thanks, honey. Love you. Bye.

65
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:44,956
Ughh. He's like a puppy
who hasn't been housebroken.

66
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:48,465
Ooh.
Who are those boys?

67
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:51,203
Or should I say men?
Wow.

68
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,787
Apparently they go to college.

69
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:58,882
Well, I hope they find someone interesting
to talk to so they don't get bored.

70
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,838
All right.
I'll do it.

71
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,793
Ooh. If Joey comes back,
cover for me.

72
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,552
What?
I'm curious about college.

73
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:14,426
- Seriously...
- Kat, will you let those people in?

74
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,728
As soon as three people leave.
We are at capacity.

75
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,931
Will you lighten up?
Our house is hotter...

76
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,155
than the swag room
at a Golden Globe party.

77
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:24,487
Dad left me in charge, which means
I'm responsible for this party.

78
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:28,273
- Have you even organized designated drivers?
- No. I'm busy hosting.

79
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:30,676
Bianca, if Padua students
are drinking here...

80
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,952
which, by the way, is illegal, you're obligated
to make sure they're taken care of.

81
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:36,403
Don't you remember the moral
of Dad's field trip to the morgue?

82
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:39,804
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Drinking, bad.
I'm not drinking, am I?

83
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,172
Designated drivers wear these.

84
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:47,826
- "Save the naked mole rats"?
- Left over from that walkathon.

85
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:51,169
Apparently people only care
about cute endangered species.

86
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,398
- Stupid pandas.
- Please let them in.

87
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,282
We can make them
the designated drivers.

88
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,261
- Ah, congratulations!
- All right!

89
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:02,808
You've been chosen
to be designated drivers.

90
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:05,138
- What?
- If I see any of you drinking...

91
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,142
- I will neuter you.
- Oh.

92
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,404
Bummer.

93
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:16,421
Heard about your party.
Did my invite get lost?

94
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,958
- Speaking of getting lost.
- Come on. I just wanna talk to you.

95
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,965
- So talk.
- Privately.

96
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:28,133
Have you seen Chastity?
The ice in her drink is melting.

97
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,869
She's over there in the corner
talking to some guy.

98
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,001
- What guy?
- He's a missionary.

99
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:35,007
Don't go over there
unless you wanna be saved.

100
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:36,458
Come dance with us.

101
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:37,569
Whoo!

102
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,310
Yeah!

103
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:41,120
Whoo!

104
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:44,819
Oh, I see. When you said,
"Wait here" at the dance...

105
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,852
you really meant
for, like, six days.

106
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:50,305
If you ever returned a phone call, you'd know
I didn't bail on you. I got arrested.

107
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,372
Oh, and here I thought you were just a jerk.
Turns out you're also a criminal.

108
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:57,513
I didn't even do anything.
The charges were dropped.

109
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,423
So let it go.

110
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:02,144
Don't.

111
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,429
- Then what do you want from me?
- Nothing.

112
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:09,314
I've seen red flags from you
ever since I met you.

113
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,113
In fact, you look
like Communist China.

114
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:16,635
What the hell am I doing here?
It's like talking to a brick wall.

115
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:19,551
You make up your mind,
and that's that.

116
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,801
Don't turn this around on me.
I didn't do anything wrong.

117
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:25,208
Oh, of course not.
You're perfect.

118
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:26,679
I am not.

119
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,518
Have fun up here
in your perfect world...

120
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,079
all by your perfect self.

121
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:39,412
Thanks. I will.
Say hello to your parole officer!

122
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,421
What is that?

123
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,975
Get out! Get--
No! No! Hello!

124
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,244
Get out of there!
That is my closet!

125
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:59,228
It looks like Bianca's
in a great mood.

126
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,293
Maybe now
she'll accept my apology.

127
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:04,391
Be careful.
She's happy, not drunk.

128
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:06,374
What's the difference?

129
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,563
Drunk girls do things
they normally wouldn't do...

130
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,490
like forgive people
or skinny-dip.

131
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,040
I'm gonna go wait in the pool.

132
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,673
Some of these chicks are bound
to come around sooner or later.

133
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,297
I'm gonna talk to Bianca.
Wish me luck.

134
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:23,234
Good luck.
All right.

135
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,519
- Tasty watermelon!
- All right!

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,818
Right after I have a snack.

137
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,310
Oh, my God, guys.
Don't drop me.

138
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,080
Thank God I wore
my good underwear tonight.

139
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,408
Thank God
I wore underwear!

140
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,385
- What are you doing?
- Shutting down this party.

141
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:01,943
I don't think so.

142
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:07,242
You know, if you weren't my sister,
I'd actually feel bad for you.

143
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,207
You're incapable of having fun.

144
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,495
I am not gonna be responsible
for your party.

145
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,015
Then I will be.

146
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:21,423
You? You've never been responsible
for anything in your entire life.

147
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:23,494
You remember your hamster?

148
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:26,885
Of course I do.
But Britney Spears was one hamster.

149
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:30,165
- I didn't know she had to eat twice a day.
- What about Gumdrop?

150
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,526
Fish are easy to forget.
You know how quiet they are.

151
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,945
Exactly.
There's always an excuse.

152
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,757
So I make mistakes.

153
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:39,465
I never claim to be
Little Miss Perfect like you.

154
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,335
Ooh! I am not perfect!

155
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:45,591
- Why does everyone keep saying that?
- Because you act like you are!

156
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,765
Fine.

157
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:51,093
You wanna be in charge
of this party? Have at it.

158
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,288
Now I'm gonna have some fun.

159
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,255
Little Miss Perfect
has just relinquished her crown.

160
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,842
Oh-ho-ho!
It's all you!

161
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,016
Drink up!

162
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,632
- Whoo!
- Ahh!

163
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,735
- Nice! All right!
- Yeah!

164
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:08,184
* I'll make you mine *

165
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,271
So before a game, I spray a tiny bit
of hair spray on my butt...

166
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:17,351
so my leotard won't ride up.

167
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:20,435
Unless we're trying
to distract the other team...

168
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,168
and then we skip the hair spray.

169
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,324
I thought cheerleaders
were just vapid cretins...

170
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:30,614
but you're actually
master strategists.

171
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:31,965
Totally.

172
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,123
- Kat, what are you doing?
- I'm just hangin'.

173
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:40,190
You know, girl-talking
about butts and stuff.

174
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,505
Look at you.
Maybe you should change your shirt.

175
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,136
Maybe you should
change your face.

176
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,029
Your sister's cool.

177
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:58,223
Bianca, do you or do you not
have any energy drinks?

178
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,377
Yeah.

179
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,569
No big D, guys, but could you shut
the fridge when you're done?

180
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,702
I need to get amped up,
'cause things are about to go down.

181
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:16,999
Wait! What? No, nothing
and no one should be going down.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,659
Chastity's not flirting with a missionary,
she's flirting with a college dude.

183
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,426
- Hey, that's my girl, man.
- Oh.

184
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:29,108
Excuse us. So sorry.
Sorry. Okay.

185
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:31,546
Okay, what has gotten into you?

186
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:34,134
This is a social function,
not Maury Povitch.

187
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:38,085
Me? You're the one flirting with
a college dude right in front of my face!

188
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,377
Well, maybe I wanted
to have a conversation...

189
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:44,517
that didn't start with,
"Um, do I, like, look fat in this?"

190
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:50,626
Hey, as a model, I have to be the boss
of my body, and that's a full-time job.

191
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,447
You think it's easy for me
to sit next to you at the movies...

192
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:57,600
while you're grubbing on Red Vines
and popcorn and gummi worms?

193
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,511
Joey, sweetie...

194
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:03,787
in an effort to support
your modeling career...

195
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,573
I'm gonna let you practice
your stupid little runway walk...

196
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,022
all the way home.

197
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:09,778
- Ohh!
- Excuse me.

198
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,337
Don't think I won't!

199
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,282
Loser!

200
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:20,352
Uh, okay, everybody.
Halftime show is over.

201
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:24,521
Let's get back to the party.
Whoo!

202
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:30,937
* Lost *

203
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,686
* In a dream *

204
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,873
* I don't know which *

205
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:38,468
* Way to go *

206
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:43,506
* You are all that you seem *

207
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:48,158
* Way too slow *

208
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,346
Ha-ha!

209
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,575
* I've been a fool before *

210
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,128
* My love caught
in a slammin' door *

211
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,334
* How about some
information, please *

212
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,074
Yes! Now, everybody
put your hands together!

213
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:09,329
Right? I wanna give a shout-out
to the naked mole rats.

214
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,322
Naked mole rats!

215
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:15,016
- Who we gonna save?
- Naked mole rats!

216
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,835
Naked mole rats!

217
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,782
Kat, you are out of control.

218
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,872
We should sing one of the songs with the
two people-- when they do it together.

219
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,150
- A duet?
- Oh...

220
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:29,980
I don't say this often enough, Bianca,
but you're so smart and prettiful.

221
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,073
I love you, Bianca!

222
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,066
I hope we stay sisters--
* Forever *

223
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,998
I think you should go outside
and get some fresh air.

224
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:48,635
* Save the naked mole rats *

225
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:55,346
Hey, weren't you in my car once?

226
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,738
You're Bianca's sister.

227
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:00,791
- You're scary.
- No, don't say that.

228
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:01,955
Okay.

229
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:07,462
I'm fun, right?
You'd tell me if I wasn't fun?

230
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:10,682
Come on. You're, like,
the funnest person in the world.

231
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:14,479
- I feel fun!
- I love watermelon!

232
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:22,035
Hey.

233
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,685
I hate myself.

234
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:27,794
I'm sure everything
with Chastity will be fine.

235
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,768
You know she can be
a bit dramatic.

236
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,658
No. These-- These had to be
at least 1,850 calories...

237
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:36,447
plus all that sodium...

238
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:38,870
I already feel bloated.

239
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:42,193
So you'll do an extra hour
of cardio tomorrow.

240
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,689
It's just so hard
to be with her sometimes.

241
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,420
Or-- Or maybe it's me.

242
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:51,604
- Maybe I'm a really bad boyfriend.
- Are you kidding me?

243
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:54,182
You're kind and sweet,
and you look great in photos.

244
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,452
You're like...
the perfect boyfriend.

245
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,279
Wow. Bianca...

246
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,939
what you just said to me filled me up
more than this bag of Cheeseritos.

247
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,849
Bianca, come upstairs.
Something freaky's going on in the toilet.

248
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,628
I'll be right back.
Don't eat.

249
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:23,590
- No more alcohol.
- It's just watermelon.

250
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:26,061
I don't drink.
I'm above the influence.

251
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:29,100
You're the guy who gets wasted
because he's too dumb to know...

252
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,525
that the watermelon was spiked.

253
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:35,033
Maybe those teen movies
really are set in reality.

254
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,228
I'm drunk?

255
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,055
Oh, I thought it was just
'cause I was depressed...

256
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:42,730
'cause Bianca's mad at me,
and...

257
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:46,461
- you're her sister.
- Mm-hmm.

258
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,112
How do I get her to forgive me?

259
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,243
Buy her something that sparkles.

260
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,741
Oh, a sparkler!

261
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:05,381
It doesn't matter anyway.
Bianca's all, like...

262
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:09,144
"Stay out of my life!"
Yell, yell, yell!

263
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,583
She won't even let me explain.

264
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:15,507
That's not nice.

265
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,249
I didn't mean
to hurt her feelings.

266
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:21,266
She probably knows that
deep down.

267
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:25,152
I bet she wishes she could
make out with you right now.

268
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:27,549
Really?
How do you know?

269
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,169
I just know things in my mind.

270
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:34,771
Do you think I should
apologize first?

271
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:38,764
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You should-- You should do that.

272
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,160
I have to make a phone call.

273
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:48,028
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo!

274
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,892
- Yeah! Here, dude!
- Put the duck down!

275
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,290
Whoo!

276
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,703
What are you doing
in my uniform?

277
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,675
This party is so awesome,
I heard about it at the North Pole.

278
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,133
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

279
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:04,958
Oh! Take it off!

280
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,425
Bianca,
I have to talk to you.

281
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:11,472
- Cameron, when did you get here?
- In time increments?

282
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:14,076
Uh, three watermelons ago.

283
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,411
Your sister is trashed,
by the way.

284
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:19,372
She's not the only one.
You need to go home.

285
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:21,216
No.

286
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:25,366
I've been waiting all night to do this,
and you have to listen to me.

287
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:30,165
I'm sorry I ruined your date with Beau,
but he was not a good person.

288
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:34,114
I know, but that doesn't excuse
what you did. Stay out of my life.

289
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:36,499
I can't.
I'm in love with you.

290
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,953
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am!

291
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:42,249
- But you're gay!
- I'm not gay... at all!

292
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:45,578
In fact, you're gayer than I am
because you kissed a girl.

293
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:46,957
That was for money.

294
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,506
See, I could never kiss a guy for money,
except for Johnny Depp.

295
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:53,270
So all this time we've been friends,
you've liked me?

296
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:56,497
No. I've loved you.

297
00:16:57,004 --> 00:17:00,805
Bianca, I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you...

298
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,113
and if it turns out we have afterlives,
I wanna spend those together, too.

299
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,052
Cameron--

300
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:10,289
Think about it. We could have a really
cool moniker, like Biameron or Camianca.

301
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,703
You pick.

302
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:17,806
I-- I don't know how to tell you this,
but I don't feel the same way.

303
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,823
I'm so sorry.

304
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,467
Maybe we should talk about this
when you're sober.

305
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,237
Um, how about we never
talk about this again?

306
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,968
Will you please take him home?

307
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,401
No, no, no. Come over
so I can tell you something.

308
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,665
Kat, I need you to help.

309
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:49,476
Because I need to do it in person.
Because I just do. Just do it.

310
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,403
Kat!

311
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,848
I am on the phone!

312
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,721
You have got to be kidding me.

313
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,696
What do you expect me to do, woman?
The toilet's jacked.

314
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:06,613
That is it!

315
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,094
The party is over!

316
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,132
Over! Okay, everybody,
it's time to leave right now!

317
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:18,021
Right now!
Come on! Leave!

318
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:22,010
Please? Please? Please?

319
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:25,460
It's time to go... away!

320
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,376
Five-head, look what I found.
Someone barfed in it.

321
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,150
Hey, it's okay. We can get it out.
Do you have a Shop-Vac?

322
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,605
Joey, I think I'm going to have
a nervous breakdown.

323
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:49,175
This party is out of control.
I'm a victim of my own success.

324
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:53,795
- How did Shane DeMarco do it?
- Tell me how I can help.

325
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,137
Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do it.

326
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:01,577
- I just want this party to be over.
- Well, then, let's get her done.

327
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,224
Come on.

328
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:12,406
I'm sorry.
Uh, can you guys get up for a sec?

329
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:15,440
Apparently somebody
who was in here has crabs.

330
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:17,541
Oh, my God!
They're everywhere!

331
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:21,559
Oh, my God!
Oh, they're everywhere!

332
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,856
It worked.
Everyone's gone.

333
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,487
I know. That was amazing.
Up top.

334
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,746
- That didn't happen.
- I know.

335
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:41,418
But... if it did,
it was amazing.

336
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,775
Too bad it didn't.

337
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:49,245
Has anybody seen my clothes?

338
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:10,068
You'd never know there was
a raging party here last night...

339
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:14,286
except for in my head.
Oh, God, the pain.

340
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,723
I was up all night.

341
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:20,375
I even steam-cleaned the carpets,
no thanks to you!

342
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,033
Inside voices.

343
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,689
Here.
Drink this.

344
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:27,997
Thank you.

345
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:32,007
"I heart Patrick"?

346
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,305
- Some jerk wrote on me.
- Don't look at me.

347
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:38,993
You're the one who called him last night
and begged him to come over.

348
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:41,969
- Oh, my God, what did I say?
- Why don't you ask him?

349
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,060
I was busy playing the role of the girl
who learns to be responsible.

350
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:48,061
Guess who played the girl who gets drunk
and makes an ass of herself?

351
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:49,044
No.

352
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:54,083
It's Dad. Uh, go upstairs
and take a shower.

353
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:58,044
Yeah. Okay. Go.
Shower time.

354
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,228
- I am never drinking again.
- Uh-huh.

355
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,767
Thanks for indulging me
with this movie night.

356
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,268
I missed you girls
this weekend, and...

357
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,972
I just wanted a nice
Sunday night together.

358
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,656
We missed you, too, Dad.

359
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:18,992
All we did was sit around
and ponder how much.

360
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:21,861
- That's why my brain hurts.
- Aw.

361
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,897
So, what movie
are we gonna watch?

362
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,970
It's called House Party...

363
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:30,693
and it was shot by this hip new
director named Mr. Duck.

364
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:36,609
<i>Now, everybody put
your hands together!</i>

365
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:39,339
<i>Right? I wanna
give a shout-out to--</i>

366
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:41,035
Settle in, girls.

367
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:43,349
We've got four hours
ahead of us.

368
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,886
<i>- What are we gonna save?
- Naked mole rats!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
