Aspiring models, please send 
in your audition tapes.

3
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:09,130
I'm Joey Donner, quarterback
of the Padua High Penguins.

4
00:00:09,231 --> 00:00:11,135
"You're my best friend"?

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,000
First, you already got
a best friend.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,000
Raising two teenage girls
by yourself--

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,135
It just seems really lonely.

8
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,931
A, I'm not going to sleep with you

9
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,500
until we talk about sex and its implications.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,837
Why do you care so much?

11
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,805
I just care about you, okay?

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>[Dr. Stratford]
Been thinking about
the other night.</i>

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,125
Yes, that kiss
surprised me, too.

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,626
Of course it was
a nice surprise.

15
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:38,128
It was like a birthday party
for my lips.

16
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,791
I'm just a little confused
about what it meant.

17
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:42,118
Maybe we could get together
to repeat it-- Discuss it.

18
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:46,285
I don't know, Saturday night?
Great.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,485
Uh, yes, ma'am,
I'm looking forward

20
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,588
to performing your C-section
on Saturday. Bye.

21
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,762
Bianca, hi.

22
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,039
I was updating my dream book,

23
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:57,809
and I realized on my list
of short-term dreams,

24
00:00:57,843 --> 00:01:00,182
I've already accomplished
the first three pages.

25
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:02,788
I'm a cheerleader,
I'm popular,

26
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:05,310
and I have
a gorgeous boyfriend.

27
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:07,379
Now to tackle my next page--

28
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:10,415
Hosting a Martha Stewart-worthy
fancy dinner party.

29
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,585
Can I do it on Saturday?
Saturday?

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,087
It just sounds like
an awful lot of work
to do in two days.

31
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:18,156
And remember, Martha Stewart
has an entire staff,

32
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,860
and a work ethic honed

33
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:23,096
in the cold reality
of a penitentiary.

34
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,764
Please, Daddy?
I'll take care of everything.

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,101
Please help my page 4
come true.

36
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:30,769
I'm supposed
to deliver babies.

37
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:35,910
I'll cancel.
I'll make my lasagna.

38
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:39,715
Oh, Daddy.
It's an adult dinner party,

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,384
so there can't be
any grown-ups.

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,457
Kat will chaperone.
She's practically elderly,

41
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,528
and that way you can still
facilitate the miracle of life.

42
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:49,130
All right.

43
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:51,900
I mean-- All right,
you know, everybody wins.

44
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,068
Where is your sister, anyway?

45
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,713
- Patrick, let's...
- Yeah? Get tested.

46
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:09,083
Not exactly what I thought
you were going to say,
but sure.

47
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:15,089
I'll make the appointment.
You're a take-charge girl.

48
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:16,758
I like that about you.

50
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:32,479
Our appointment's
after school at 3:15.

51
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,583
The results take an hour.
Have you given any thought

52
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:38,820
to when and where
we should consummate?

53
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,289
I was thinking 4:15,

54
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:41,824
alley behind
the testing center.

55
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,693
Great. I'll meet you
in the dumpster.

56
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,839
Saturday night.

57
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:57,041
And don't worry, it ain't
going to be in a dumpster.

58
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,780
Oh, Kat,
I forgot to tell you,

59
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,782
you're chaperoning
my dinner party
Saturday night.

60
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,185
I've rented you an assortment
of political documentaries,

61
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,453
so you can stay in your room
and be outraged.

62
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:12,123
Sounds fun, but I have plans.

63
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:14,126
Even better. Just tell Dad
you're chaperoning.

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,895
What are you doing?
Something really boring

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,664
that would be
of no interest to you.

66
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,472
- Dawn, come on.
- Okay, bye.

67
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,808
Okay, bye.

68
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:35,148
Michael, I have a girlfriend.
Girlfriend. I have a girlfriend.

69
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,816
And she's so hot.

70
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,922
I know. I just wish i heard from you
instead of from graffiti on the bathroom wall.

71
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,157
Really? What does it say?

72
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,160
"Cameron James is dating
way out of his league."

73
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,596
At least it doesn't say
"Spoink is dating
way out of his league."

74
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,432
Mike, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,633
What are you doing
Saturday night?

76
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,369
You want to play video games
till we're nauseous?

77
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:59,841
Sure, sure,
but there is something
that I should tell you

78
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,410
- before we hang out.
- What?

79
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:05,980
I...

80
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,187
<i>I just became a level 8
ogre slayer in Ogre Slayer.</i>

81
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:15,791
Oh! I pay liege to you,
menace to the ogre world.

82
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:16,959
Oh, yeah.

83
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,527
Okay, Cameron and Dawn
are coming.

84
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,462
This is my chance to show
I'm cool with it,

85
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:23,465
and I also invited Chastity
because, well...

86
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,468
- If you don't, she'll kill you.
 - Pretty much.

87
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,470
I have no idea
who she's bringing.

88
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:29,805
I just hope he has manners.

89
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,074
This party is
supposed to be classy.

90
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:36,145
- [cell phone chimes]
It's from my mom.

91
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,150
<i>Oh, my God.
The Biggest Poser called.</i>

92
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:42,185
I have an audition
this afternoon.

93
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,321
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

94
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,823
I know.
Will you come with me?

95
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:48,492
You make me feel so confident,
and when I look into your eyes,

96
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,161
I can see
how good-looking I am.

97
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:52,163
Oh, of course I will.

98
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:55,466
Wow, Joey, all our dreams
really are coming true.

99
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:03,442
This music is making me hot.
Maybe they sell the CD.

100
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,692
Hey. Curiosity killed the cat.

101
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,360
Yeah. Well,
better that than an STD.

102
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:24,030
Seriously, how many girls
have you slept with?

103
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,967
Oh, let's see.
Uh, ski trip, summer camp...

104
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:34,000
- Oh, babysitter. Carry the one. 311.
- Darn. I've only slept with 300.

105
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,409
I'll have to catch up.

106
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:42,516
- You, cowboy. You're next.
- Giddy-up.

107
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:53,827
Hey, we need to talk.
I need a favor.

108
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:56,497
I haven't made Dawn
break up with you.
Favor granted.

109
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:59,500
Look, I made plans with Dawn
and my friend Michael.

110
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,268
For the first time
in my life,

111
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,437
I'm double-booked
on a Saturday night.

112
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:07,441
Having a girlfriend is
so much more complicated
than I thought.

113
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:12,112
Would you please
bring Michael as your date
to Bianca's dinner party?

114
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:15,183
Ugh, no. I'd rather
go with a hand puppet.

115
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,451
Why would you even
suggest that?

116
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:22,123
Chastity,
Michael's whole dream
in life is to be popular.

117
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:23,457
Think what would happen
if he went

118
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,126
with the most popular girl
in school,

119
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,629
what that would do for him.
It'd be like he's a book,

120
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,798
and you're Oprah's
seal of approval.

121
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,867
You're that powerful.

122
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,035
He'd be like
my own little version

123
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,904
of that school
in South Africa.

124
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,206
Yeah.

125
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,475
But tell him to meet me
outside Bianca's house

126
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,277
because I do not want him
to know where I live.

127
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:51,652
If I don't sit
Cameron and Dawn
next to each other,

128
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,488
they'll think I'm not okay
with them being a couple,

129
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:56,158
but if I do,
then there's that awkward
height differential,

130
00:06:56,192 --> 00:07:00,363
which is not elegant.
But friendship comes first.

131
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:01,931
<i>How do celebrities
and In Style do this?</i>

132
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,201
- Joey, help me.
- Babe, I'm minutes away

133
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,771
from the most important
five minutes of my life.

134
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:10,440
I got to stretch my face.

135
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,776
I'm sorry.
You're totally right.
You stay focused.

136
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:16,479
- Joey Donner.
- That's me.

137
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:22,286
Remember, you're beautiful
inside and out.

138
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,454
Rock it.

139
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,461
Is he your boyfriend?

140
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:33,331
He's so hot. He's totally
going to make the show.

141
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,833
I hope so.

142
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:41,772
You play your cards right,
you'll get a ton of screen time.

143
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,241
the one
where I slept with him

144
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,442
in the same room
as five other people

145
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,444
and the one
where he dumped me.

146
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,281
God, I'm so sorry.

147
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,116
That's what I get
for dating a reality star.

148
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,018
They either dump you
or cheat on you.

149
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,956
But it's cool. I had
a great crying scene.
I'm very proud of it.

We're putting you in the shot.
Do you have on a bikini?

155
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:25,752
Your boyfriend's been in there
a really long time.

156
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:28,388
You do know
where we are, right?

157
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:36,429
All clear.
What took you so long?

158
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,964
I got my results
20 minutes ago.

159
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,367
Sorry. The nurse made me
put a condom on a banana.

160
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:43,169
- It's harder than it looks.
- Why? Were you nervous?

161
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:48,440
- No, I'm just sick of this Muzak.
- Can we go? Yep, we can go.

162
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:49,641
All the way home.

163
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,099
Do you like my dress?

164
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,801
Do I look okay?
God, I'm so nervous.

165
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,204
It's just a dinner party
for a bunch of high school
nimrods.

166
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:16,874
You don't understand.
Next week, Joey could be
in a New York penthouse

167
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:20,211
with 11 gorgeous, hungry,
insecure models and a hot tub.

168
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:23,315
I need to be memorable
so he doesn't dump me
on national television.

169
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:25,884
Think you're going to achieve
all that with one dress?

170
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,354
You're right.
I should sleep with him.

171
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,889
Great idea.
Just be sure to get pregnant.

172
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:33,559
Then he'll never forget you
because he'll be paying
child support.

173
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,829
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:40,499
Matching underwear
and you shaved your legs?

175
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,901
You're having sex
with Patrick Verona tonight.

176
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:44,235
I am not.

177
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,570
Oh, my God.
You're such a hypocrite.

178
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,238
If you can have sex,
why can't I?

179
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:49,941
Because I'm mature,
and you're a 15-year-old idiot.

180
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:51,909
I forbid you.
You can't forbid me
to do anything.

181
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:55,346
Besides, I know you were my age
when you slept with Josh.

182
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:59,583
Your journal fell open
into my lap.

183
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:01,252
Well, did you read the part
where the next day,

184
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:03,221
we moved here
and he never called me again?

185
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:05,090
No.

186
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:07,226
After we moved,
you started hiding
your journal.

187
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,595
So much for our
long-distance relationship.

188
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:13,966
Two days later,
he posted pics of himself
on Facebook kissing Hannah.

189
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:17,937
- Gross. We hate Josh.
- It was devastating.

190
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,272
And as much as I hate you,

191
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,708
I don't want to see you
making the same mistake.

192
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,044
Why is it any different
this time with Patrick?

193
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,580
Because mature people
realize that sex is not love.

194
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:32,285
We got tested. We're not
seeing other people.
It's no big deal.

195
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,188
Wow. That sounds like
a wonderful transaction.

196
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,469
- Joey, how do I look?
- Great, hon.

197
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:53,304
I'm trying to find
the spot in your house
with the best reception.

198
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,241
<i>The Biggest Poser people
are calling tonight,
and I can't miss it.</i>

199
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:06,185
Welcome. Thank you for coming
to my dinner party.

200
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,190
Wow, Bianca,
this is so elegant
and sophisticated.

201
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:13,193
Yeah? I really wanted it
to be fancy and classy.

202
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:14,928
We brought you
some Sparkling Cider.

203
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,263
Oh, that's lovely.

204
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,799
Please come in and help yourself
to some hors d'oeuvres.

205
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,500
Oh, man, shrimp!

206
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:36,949
Seriously?
We're going to do it
in the back of Keith's van?

207
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,784
This isn't much better
than a dumpster.

208
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:39,819
You sure about that?

209
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,325
How did you--
See?

210
00:11:47,359 --> 00:12:01,337
Okay, here the
the ground rules.

211
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,572
You are not to look me
directly in the eye.

212
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:07,241
If you tell people
that we had any type
of physical contact,

213
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,909
I will sever
something important.

214
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,143
<i>Capisce?</i>

215
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:16,114
Trust me,
there is a 0.0% chance
of that happening.

216
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:17,414
What, am I not your type?

217
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:19,850
Because your type
is anything with a pulse.

218
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,485
No, what I meant was that--
Was what?

219
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,254
This had better be good
because right now
I'm insulted

220
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,056
and you do not
want to insult me.

221
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,825
No, I wouldn't hook up with you
because I'm gay.

222
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:30,493
You're gay?

223
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:35,597
Yes, yes, but I've only been out
for three days.

224
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,599
Benji says I'm a new-born.

225
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,601
Please don't say anything,
okay?

226
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,437
I still haven't
got up the nerve
to tell Cameron yet.

227
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,673
Don't worry.
I can keep a secret.

228
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,609
- He's gay?
- Gay?

229
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:56,147
Gay, gay...
But Cameron doesn't know,

230
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,815
and I promised Michael
I wouldn't tell anybody,

231
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,617
so you can't go
blabbing it around, okay? Sh.

232
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,552
Trust me, I won't.
The last thing I want

233
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:04,856
is coming out drama
at my sophisticated party.

234
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,892
You know, I never thought
I'd say this,

235
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,561
but you and Chastity
look kind of cute together,

236
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:12,231
like the elephant
that made friends
with the dog.

237
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:15,901
Yeah, she's not
really my type.

238
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:20,337
- Well, you never know.
- I know.

239
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,274
I guess I'm just concerned
about the age difference.

240
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:27,209
You're very young,
and I'm very--

241
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,277
Older.

242
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,912
And I'm the girls'
guidance counselor.

243
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,247
If I'm romantically involved
with their father,

244
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,416
and I advise them
to go to college out of state,

245
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,451
they could misconstrue
my intentions.

246
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:39,186
Plus, you might want
to have children.

247
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,091
And you don't like mushrooms,
and I love mushrooms.

248
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,460
That doesn't really seem
like a deal-breaker.

249
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:50,765
Oh, my God, I'm doing exactly
what Dr. Frumowitz says.

250
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm keeping you
at arm's length

251
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,102
because
of my abandonment issues

252
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,937
and fear of intimacy,

253
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:58,874
and you're doing
the exact same thing.

254
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:02,777
We're mirroring and projecting
and future tripping.

255
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:07,749
Okay, I was with you
all the way until
future tripping.

256
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,621
I think we should
give it a shot.

257
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:13,956
I do, too.

258
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:20,230
And then I posed like this.
And then I threw in

259
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:25,235
a few eyewear poses
that I think blew their minds.

260
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,970
He's so good.

261
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:28,906
I have to get
my grandmother's serving dish.

262
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,509
Will you please
keep an eye on the meat?

263
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:33,178
And try to get Dawn
off Cameron's lap.

264
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,279
It's not elegant.

265
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:39,836
No problem, Five-o.
So than,  i took-off my--.

266
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,117
[Phonering] or... it's could
to been good model.

267
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,175
Hey, you know who'd make
a good model?

268
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,811
You, my tall drink of water.

269
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,718
Dawn, Dawn...

270
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:01,088
Oh, sweetie,
I know that this must
be so hard for you,

271
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:03,757
watching your straight
best friend kiss a girl,

272
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,427
knowing that
that will never be you.

273
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:10,097
- So sorry.
- Oh, Dawn.

274
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:13,737
Did Joey check the meat? Where is he?

275
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,401
Oh, no.

276
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,939
<i>I'm on The Biggest Poser.</i>

277
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,941
I leave for New York tomorrow!
[all cheer]

278
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:51,648
You know how long
I've wanted to do this?

279
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,483
Since that first day
I saw you at school.

280
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,418
You mean
that creepy stare-off?

281
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,453
It wasn't creepy, it was sexy.

282
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,490
Don't forget who won
that stare-off, buddy.

283
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,825
Me.
I let you win.

284
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,227
I only walked away
because I knew

285
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:08,831
- it would drive you nuts. - Don't flatter 
yourself. - I knew I'd get you eventually.

286
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:15,838
- You'd get me? - Well, I'm about to, aren't I?
- Is that what this is?

287
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:17,840
Your master plan to get me
to sleep with you?

288
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,210
- I'm just some sex object?
- No.

289
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,913
You talk way too much
to be just a sex object.

290
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,187
Oh, come on.
What just happened?

291
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:32,588
Weren't we having fun?

292
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:34,557
I'm sorry,
did you want me to answer?

293
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:38,361
I thought I talked too much.
You're overreacting. You're right.

294
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,963
I should just be happy
to be girl #312.

295
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,465
Is that what this is about?

296
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,200
You know I haven't slept
with that many girls.

297
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,935
I'm in high school,
not the NBA.

298
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,570
Do you bring them
in here, too?

299
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:50,206
Do you and Keith run
a little brothel on wheels?

300
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:54,310
Yeah, but don't worry...
The first one's free.

301
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,213
Why are you freaking out?

302
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:59,315
I thought we both
wanted to do this.

303
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,085
Just because
I want to have sex
doesn't mean I should.

304
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:06,979
God, I've been fooled
by guys like you before,
but not this time.

305
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:12,117
- Take me home. 
- With pleasure.

306
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,061
I'll tell you one thing--

307
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,898
I am not going to be
the guy who's not there
to make friends.

308
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:30,534
I want to make friends,
and then beat them.

309
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:32,702
Okay, everybody.

310
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:36,973
Now it's time for a toast
to Joey's new life.

311
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,443
I'm so happy all your dreams
are coming true.

312
00:17:56,483 --> 00:18:01,220
Should we leave,
or stick around for dessert?

313
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,722
I don't know.

314
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:04,223
She made
this yummy cheesecake.

315
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,692
I was really looking
forward to it.

316
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,761
Cameron, I'm gay.

317
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:16,235
I am so glad I came tonight.

318
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:22,908
Hey, what's the matter?

319
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:25,911
Joey, I don't want you to think
that I'm not happy for you,

320
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:29,315
because I am.

321
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,584
Your abs are going to be
on national television.

322
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:34,587
I'm just...

323
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,589
I'm worried everything's
going to change.

324
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:38,924
Five-o, the only thing
the show's going to change

325
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,664
is my address and hair color,

326
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:45,064
not the way I feel about you.

327
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:49,502
I love you, Bianca,
whether I'm in San Diego,
New York, or Japan.

328
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,738
Apparently, they go cuckoo
for blonds in Japan.

329
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:56,709
Wait, did you just say
that you love me?

330
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,044
Duh.

331
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:01,280
My God, I love you, too.

332
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,388
This is the best
dinner party ever. JOEY Yea!

333
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,257
Hey, bud. You okay?

334
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,559
Michael,
just give me a minute.

335
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,895
I need a chance
to process this.

336
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,899
I know. It's a shock.

337
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,569
Well, I guess thinking back,
the signs were there,

338
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:38,240
like that day in kindergarten
when I first saw you run.

339
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:43,578
Uh, excuse you,
I have a very masculine gait.

340
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:47,249
You were chasing the girl
who stole your My Little Pony.

341
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:52,254
Ah, Starsong. I miss her.

342
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:57,259
So are you weirded out?

343
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:01,596
No, no, no. I could not be
more down with the gays.

344
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:05,600
If my parents die,
I'm moving to Palm Springs
to live with my gay uncle.

345
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:08,270
He throws these awesome
game nights.

346
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:14,276
Okay, okay, because
there is one more thing
that I need to tell you.

347
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,279
You have a crush on me?
'Cause that's cool.

348
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:22,617
No, no. I'm not
a level 8 ogre slayer.

349
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:25,287
You thought I had
a crush on you?

350
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,621
Well...

351
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:35,336
- Joey, on the other hand...
- I keep losing out to that guy.

352
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:56,540
but it's okay
because he told me
he loves me.

353
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:59,210
That's great. You didn't even
have to sleep with him.

354
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:03,647
- So how was sexy time?
- Didn't happen.

355
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:06,150
We had a huge fight.
I think it's over.

356
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:09,153
Oh, God. Kat, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

357
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:11,188
I'm fine.

358
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,360
Right.

359
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:19,543
