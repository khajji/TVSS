1
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,407
So, we had to write about
the day that changed our life.

2
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,052
I wrote about the day I met you
in the girls' bathroom.

3
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:10,773
- Still think about it.
- I wrote about today.

4
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:13,856
The day I kicked you hard
in the gonads.

5
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,201
What did you really write about?

6
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:20,288
The day I started reading
Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,637
It was the dawn
of my feminist awakening.

8
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:24,957
And I wrote about a trip
to the county fair.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,938
Oh, God, it sucks.

10
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:30,356
Be honest. When you read it,
was there suckage?

11
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:32,253
No, not at all.

12
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:35,086
I'm sure Miss Summers
will love your paper.

13
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,550
Hayden proposed.

14
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:40,639
The one she's going
to hate is mine.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,890
She's so far from being a feminist.
It's like she just won The Bachelor.

16
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:46,838
What?
My sister watches it.

17
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,401
It's so sparkly because
I brush it with toothpaste.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,628
Okay, guys, we need to talk.
I'm mad at you.

19
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:01,802
I read your papers last night,
and they were amazing.

20
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:05,706
You really opened up and let me in.

21
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:10,998
Felix, I could taste the salt water
from that first wave you rode.

22
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:18,497
Samgui, my cheeks burned with the
humiliation of that spelling bee defeat.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,863
Lucy, I could smell the tarts...

24
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,830
baking in your Bubby's kitchen
right before it burned down.

25
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:30,281
I wonder if she could feel Bubby's
second-degree burns on the way to the E.R.

26
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:34,348
Kat, if I'm not interrupting
anything too important...

27
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:37,646
would you like
to pass the papers out?

28
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,870
See?
No suckage.

29
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,673
- Miss Summers, I think there's a problem.
- What is it, Kat?

30
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:03,565
- Everyone got an A.
- Well, that's what I thought everyone deserved.

31
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:06,447
Besides, how can
I grade your memories?

32
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:10,426
Well, some memories are more
well-written than others.

33
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:14,857
Kat, you are so funny.

34
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:18,379
- I wasn't kidding.
- It's 2 karats.

35
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,857
I just want to hug it.

36
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,902
So, I was thinking
you need a new purse, Dawn.

37
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:28,063
How long have you had that one?
Four years?

38
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,227
Two months.

39
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,463
Well, after two months,
I give mine to the homeless.

40
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:34,392
Oh, and you should see
how happy it makes them.

41
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,567
I know, after school
let's go shopping.

42
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:39,111
We can get you a new purse.
And then we can get peddies.

43
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:41,936
It's sandal season.
And then we can get sandals.

44
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,264
I can't.

45
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:47,179
Uh, wear sandals because
of this big, gnarly bunion.

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,930
Ew, that just ruined my appetite.

47
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:54,094
Hi. Can I get diet soda,
a chicken breast...

48
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:57,445
and an ice cream sandwich?
No, wait. Forget the chicken.

49
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,529
Thanks.

50
00:02:58,786 --> 00:03:00,802
- Four dollars.
- Can you cover me, Bianca?

51
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:03,890
I only have a 50
and a couple hundies.

52
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,643
Oh, do you have
some extra money?

53
00:03:06,747 --> 00:03:09,544
I only have a 50
and a couple hundies.

54
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:14,051
I sold my brother's Lego death star
on eBay, and this is all I have left.

55
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:17,954
It's so expensive being a teenager.
Why can't Brad and Angie adopt us?

56
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:20,305
At least I've got a shot.
I'm Asian.

57
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:25,826
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

58
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:31,188
So, let me recap.
You thought you deserved an A.

59
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:35,006
You got an A, and your GPA
will stay a 4.0.

60
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,419
That is horrible.

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,276
But it is.
If everyone gets an A...

62
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:42,849
that's only good news for the people
who don't deserve them.

63
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,798
- Miss Summers doesn't get that.
- Miss Summers?

64
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,850
Oh, I didn't realize we were
talking about Miss Summers.

65
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,058
Is she still dating Mr. Hargrove,
the health teacher?

66
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:55,644
- If his name is Hayden, he just proposed.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:58,545
So, he is the marrying type.

68
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,608
No, I get it.

69
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,756
She's like
the younger version of me...

70
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:07,007
if I was an insipid little
manipulator from the South.

71
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,868
I just think this is
kind of a serious issue.

72
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,202
What's the impetus to excel
without the incentive?

73
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:15,935
Mm-hmm. I am glad that you've
brought this to my attention, Kat.

74
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,365
The problem with women
like Miss Summers...

75
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:21,336
is they are so hell-bent
on getting a man...

76
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:26,007
they look upon teaching
not as a sacred vocation...

77
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:29,790
but as a weigh station
to poach other people's boyfriends...

78
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:33,995
and marry them and start
popping out babies like tic tacs.

79
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,867
That's why they should be drummed
out of the school system.

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,084
No, I don't want to get
anybody drummed out.

81
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:42,373
I just want everyone to get
the grade they deserve.

82
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,698
Whose side are you on?

83
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:52,271
I mean, grade inflation could damage
the reputation of Padua High...

84
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:55,254
so after raising a little hell
with the administration...

85
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,623
I will no longer be graded
alongside that moron...

86
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:00,316
who turned in a one-page essay
written in highlighter.

87
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,759
Look at you, fighting inflation.
Maybe you are capitalist after all.

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,620
Speaking of inflation, can I get
an advance on my allowance?

89
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:10,414
Stop being a capitalist. I'm not an ATM.
You can't just push my buttons and get cash.

90
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:12,938
Which is why I was thinking
I should have a credit card.

91
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:16,158
Then I don't need cash.
Great idea, right?

92
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,661
- Yeah, dad. Why didn't you think of that?
- I listened to you blabber on about your grade.

93
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:21,525
- Now it's my turn.
- No, it's my turn.

94
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:25,208
- What do you need so much money for anyway?
- Chastity is finally asking me...

95
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,060
to hang out with her.
This is huge.

96
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,101
I know.
She never mentioned Chastity.

97
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:32,703
Think of it as a business expense, like when
you play golf with the head of the hospital...

98
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:37,174
only our version of golf is shopping, personal
grooming, and insanely expensive yogurt.

99
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:41,900
But the social confidence I gain in high school
will benefit me for the rest of my life.

100
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,640
The scary thing is
I think you actually believe that.

101
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:48,505
This is America, honey. If you want
extra money, you'll have to get a job.

102
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:50,722
- Or be injured on the job.
- I'm 15...

103
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,257
I don't drive,
I have no work experience.

104
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:56,292
I can't even babysit. Everybody
in this neighborhood has a nanny.

105
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:59,106
Why don't you just tell your friends
you can't afford these things?

106
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:02,017
You don't get California at all.

107
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:10,744
And then my dad said I should invite Chastity
over to play board games after school.

108
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,109
Shoot me now.

109
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,168
Oh, I'm having daddy déjà-vu.
This is too depressing to talk about.

110
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:19,183
- Did you watch The Hills last night?
- Yes, boring.

111
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:22,673
All they do is sit around and gossip about
cute guys and other girls who are being bitches.

112
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,296
Just like us.
Only, they get paid for it.

113
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,534
We're a gazillion times
more interesting than Audrina.

114
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,734
- Let's start a web show.
- Ooh, can we get rich doing that?

115
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,479
We'll start small. I bet we can
make enough for frozen yogurt.

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,620
And let's not forget, The Hills
all started with Laguna Beach.

117
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,589
Cameron, are you free
today after school?

118
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,386
Oh, I was supposed to go
visit my grandfather...

119
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:54,947
at the nursing home,
but I can easily cancel.

120
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,727
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he doesn't recognize me anyway.

121
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:01,325
Um, I need your help
purchasing a domain name...

122
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,487
and setting up
an online payment system.

123
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:05,724
- What are you selling?
- Myself.

124
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,030
Dawn and I are starting this new web show.
It's going to be an intimate look...

125
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,634
at our private lives.

126
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:13,020
Oh, gosh. Who wouldn't
want to watch that?

127
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:14,872
Of course I'll help.

128
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,938
Thanks, Cameron.
I'll call you later.

129
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,638
Sometimes they take
a while to drop.

130
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,338
So do your testicles.

131
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:28,306
I- I'm gentle. And a man.
A gentle man.

132
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:31,985
- It used to be a good thing.
- Dude, you're too gentle.

133
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:35,468
You're like that little bear
that sells fabric softener.

134
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:38,611
Wait, so,
how do I change that?

135
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,498
Do I look like Dr. Phil?

136
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,885
Look, I know you're scary
and tough and all...

137
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:47,110
but I really need advice from
someone other than my friend Michael.

138
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:51,463
There's a reason the only girl
he's kissed is his cousin Ruth.

139
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,400
All right, listen.
Girls are pack animals.

140
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:00,676
You've got the be the alpha dog.
Show her you've got fangs.

141
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:03,814
I should... bite her.

142
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,975
Dude, seriously?

143
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,121
You've got to show her
that you can protect her.

144
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,522
Okay, protect her.

145
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:15,633
Yeah, maybe I can do that this afternoon
while I'm setting up her online commerce.

146
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:19,743
Yeah, you can protect her
from all that unwanted spam.

147
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,448
I can be her antivirus software.

148
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,069
Okay, guys, since one of your
fellow classmates complained...

149
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,627
I've re-graded your papers
on the curve...

150
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:37,278
as directed by the principal
and a spurned, bitter woman.

151
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,077
For some of you, these grades
are going to be upsetting.

152
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:42,719
But just know,
I'm grading your papers...

153
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,309
and not the light
that's inside you.

154
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,176
I still got an A.

155
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:08,528
Is that my paper? Is it an A-minus?
My footnotes may have been overkill.

156
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:12,007
Mandella.

157
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,583
A B-minus?

158
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,801
Who do you think is hotter,
Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Reynolds?

159
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:31,949
Jakey. Ryan's too chiseled.
You could cut yourself on his abs.

160
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:37,384
Oh, my God. That's our first viewer.
Five dollars.

161
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:38,680
- Cha-ching.
- Cha-ching.

162
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:42,781
Ooh, maybe we shouldn't talk about
money on the air. Let's keep going.

163
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:49,037
Uh, Dawn, I wanted to know
which sandals you like better.

164
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,861
Oh, those. Totally.

165
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,456
Yeah, me, too.

166
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:58,223
- But those are cute, too.
- I like their buckle.

167
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,816
Oh, me, too.

168
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,030
Well, this is fun.

169
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:07,448
Two guys watching two girls
talk about shoes.

170
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:11,168
Oh, man, look how
she chews her pencil.

171
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:15,195
No, this is wrong.
I'm supposed to be protecting her.

172
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:20,396
Dawn, will you scratch my back?
I think I have a bug bite.

173
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,151
A little to the left.

174
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,236
Now it's getting good.

175
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,433
You got to go under the shirt.
Oh, scratch it good.

176
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,401
No, up. Up.

177
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:35,312
I can't watch any more of this.

178
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,183
Ah, that's it.

179
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,679
Charlie, yo, you got
to check out this website.

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,245
Uh, BiancaAndDawn.org.

181
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:47,303
Oh, why did I help her set this up?

182
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,869
Gosh, I hate being a gentleman.

183
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,100
You're so much better at this
than my friend Ashley.

184
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,016
She used to tickle my back
at summer camp.

185
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:56,721
Here, let me try both hands.

186
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:04,928
Okay, maybe we should dive back
into our geometry homework.

187
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,221
Or you could scratch
my back some more.

188
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:32,563
Miss Summers, I'm so sorry
to bother you, but wow.

189
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:36,534
You look really pretty today.
Maybe it's that prenuptial glow.

190
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,170
Thank you, Kat.
I feel pretty today.

191
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:42,241
Listen, I'm sorry I got all worked up
about that grade situation...

192
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:46,145
but I take this seriously because I really
want to get into a top college.

193
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:49,758
My dream is to one day wear
a class ring from brown.

194
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:55,075
Have you ever wanted a ring so badly,
it made you a little insane?

195
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,436
I have, Kat.
You'll get there.

196
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:01,573
It may take an ultimatum,
but do not give up.

197
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:05,156
Which is why I want
to circle back to this B-minus.

198
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,663
You didn't think
I was pretty at all, did you?

199
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:11,499
Of course I did. Of course I did.
And gracious and open-minded.

200
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:13,627
I gave you the grade you deserved.

201
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:16,051
I know you gave A's to people
who wrote about surfing...

202
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:18,521
and spelling
and the stupid county fair.

203
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:22,502
I write about the day that, as a female,
I discovered that society valued me less...

204
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:26,642
and you give me a B-minus?
That's grade retaliation, and you know it.

205
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:30,404
Kat, astronauts on the international space
station can see that you're a feminist.

206
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:32,755
I wanted to learn
something I didn't know.

207
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:37,117
Your essay was predictable, preachy,
and quite frankly, shallow.

208
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:41,162
If you'll forgive me,
I'm late for a cake tasting.

209
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,547
I'm shallow?

210
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,028
Okay, according to our web tracking,
we went from one to five viewers...

211
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:52,420
with the back scratching. We then
spiked to 22 hits with the pillow fight.

212
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,426
And then we topped it all out
after we bounced on the bed...

213
00:12:55,427 --> 00:13:01,479
tossing beach balls for a grand total of--
Drum roll, please... $110.

214
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:04,120
We also got a nice cardio workout.
Win-win.

215
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:07,083
Hey, girls.
Nice beach balls.

216
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:13,331
They are our fan base?
Yuck.

217
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,632
You want to know
what makes it less yucky?

218
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,230
The cash.

219
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:22,024
Hey, girls. So, at the mall Saturday,
there's a purse sale...

220
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:26,296
at needless markups where the pradas
are reduced to only $250.

221
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:30,172
But don't let the other girls know
'cause I want them to get jelly, okay?

222
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:33,179
- We won't say a word.
- Can't wait.

223
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:38,062
- We're going to need a lot more viewers.
- How do we top beach balls?

224
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,902
Charlie, you and your friends
and your friends' friends...

225
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,033
should tune into BiancaAndDawn.org
tonight for some Katie Perry action.

226
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,841
I'll start popping my popcorn.

227
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:50,988
Sign my petition
to stop grade retaliation.

228
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:54,643
Teachers should not be able
to wield grades like weapons.

229
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,427
All right.

230
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,954
Mandella. Oh, people at this school
have no integrity.

231
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:08,418
Will you sign this? It would
be nice to have a real person...

232
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,152
other than Mr. Balzac
and Mr. I.P. Freely.

233
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:14,017
I can't sign it.
I don't support your cause.

234
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,054
Why not?

235
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:18,461
- I heard what you said to Miss Summers.
- Yeah, I thought my grade was unfair.

236
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:21,470
And you pooped on my paper
to prove your point.

237
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:25,235
Mandella, no offense. You wrote
about going to the county fair.

238
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:29,338
Hey, it hurts when someone tells you
you're too fat to ride the Ferris wheel.

239
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,834
- Someone told you that?
- Oh, my God. You didn't even read it.

240
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,338
Mandella, I'm so sorry.

241
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,331
Yeah, well, everything
isn't always about you, Kat.

242
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,563
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Dr. Stratford.

243
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,250
Hey, girls.
Back again, Dawn?

244
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,301
I'm going to have to put
your name on the mailbox.

245
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,854
He's trying to be funny.

246
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,661
- Good one.
- Well--

247
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:02,669
- We're going upstairs to study.
- I'll let you know when it's dinner time.

248
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,720
Uh, can you just leave it
outside my door? Thanks.

249
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:10,365
- It's nice to see her making friends.
- She finally has someone to braid her hair.

250
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:13,257
Dad, I'm going to ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

251
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,290
Okay.

252
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,954
- Am I self-centered?
- Yes.

253
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:20,261
- Seriously?
- Yes, you're seriously self-centered.

254
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:23,525
How is that even possible?
I volunteer at soup kitchens.

255
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:26,130
My car is a bio-diesel.
I want to change the world.

256
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:29,182
Yeah, but sometimes you're so focused
on the plight of the polar bear...

257
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:33,643
you forget everything else--
Eating, sleeping, other people's feelings.

258
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,709
I can't believe this.
I'm self-centered.

259
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,820
You're also a teenager.
It's a common symptom.

260
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,446
- I don't want to be common.
- Which is--

261
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:44,211
What's the word?
Self-centered.

262
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,360
Look, you have to be different
from everyone else.

263
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,134
- You have to try and--
- Okay.

264
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:52,115
These talks are supposed to make
me feel better. Do your job.

265
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:56,913
It's natural to be curious about
what it's like, don't you think?

266
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,118
I think it's just normal,
teenage experimentation.

267
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:01,552
Mm-hmm.

268
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:10,202
Do it. Do it.
Do it. Do it.

269
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,264
- Aaaaw.
- So close.

270
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,905
Bianca!
Stop making me laugh.

271
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:35,095
Sorry, you just look
really weird up close.

272
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:38,962
Okay. Okay.
Just close your eyes...

273
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:42,830
and just imagine
all those sandals and purses.

274
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:44,969
Okay.

275
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,301
This makes up for my parents
blocking The L Word.

276
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,247
Uh-huh. Nice.

277
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,444
Hot choc-- okay!

278
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,480
Uh, dad, it's-- it's not
what it looks like.

279
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:08,123
We were just filming
a web show.

280
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,792
But you're the one who said
I should be enterprising.

281
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:20,371
And you're the one who wants people
to watch your every move.

282
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,549
Well, you got your wish.

283
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,213
- But, dad--
- But, Bianca...

284
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:27,818
once you put something out on the internet,
you can never take it back. It will live forever.

285
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,161
- I got it.
- People like college admissions officers...

286
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,668
future employers, your future husband
could one day see this.

287
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:35,311
- Fine, sexy web show, bad.
- Anyone from your friends...

288
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:38,029
to our minister to a child predator
could be watching.

289
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,130
Are we done?

290
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:43,544
What exactly do you think those guys
are doing while they're watching you?

291
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,326
Oh, ew! Ew! Ew!

292
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:51,036
Now we're done.

293
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,499
Kat, I just got my new set
of Bridal mags.

294
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,250
Do not come ruin my buzz.

295
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,592
I rewrote my paper.
I was hoping you would read it.

296
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:07,245
Oh, my God.
You're like the terminator.

297
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:11,038
Did Miss Tharp put you up to this?
Fine, I'll give you a stupid A.

298
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,648
Just promise me
this helps you graduate early.

299
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:17,369
I don't want you to re-grade it.
I deserved that B-minus.

300
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,620
It did lack an emotional component.

301
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:23,154
But I didn't just want to tell you,
"you were right". I wanted to show you. So...

302
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:26,201
I wrote about the most
mortifying day of my life.

303
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:30,429
Oh,"the day my dad bought me
my first box of tampons."

304
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,340
Ew.

305
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:34,352
Oh, Kat,
I am so proud of you.

306
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,598
As long as it doesn't end with
"and then I became a feminist."

307
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:47,794
- Mandella, can we talk?
- Why don't you write me a note?

308
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,436
Because unlike some people,
I'll actually read it.

309
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,688
I was wrong.
I should've read your paper.

310
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,895
And so last night I did.
It made me cry.

311
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,698
- Really?
- Yes.

312
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,876
It made me realize how much
my paper lacked any--

313
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,063
- Hey, we were talking about me.
- Right. Sorry, old habits.

314
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,533
Anyway, I really felt
like I was there with you.

315
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:18,481
When you described the taste of that cookie
you ate to suppress your humiliation...

316
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,806
I tasted it.

317
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:22,161
Shut up.

318
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,779
For real?

319
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:29,039
- What kind was it?
- Oatmeal Raisin.

320
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,641
Oh, my gosh. Is he going
to tell my parents?

321
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,715
Everyone's talking
about your little web show.

322
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:40,931
Chastity, I'm sorry. It was--
It was gross and wrong...

323
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:43,486
- and we should've--
- Asked me to be on it.

324
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,541
I'm hurt.
I thought we were friends.

325
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,064
We are friends. That's why
we're going shopping together.

326
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:51,280
Ooh, no, not anymore.
I'm going with Mandy and Janelle.

327
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:56,396
And while we're buying shoes, we're going to
commiserate how hurt we were at being excluded.

328
00:19:56,397 --> 00:20:00,496
- I wonder how they're making money.
- Ooh, I'm on it.

329
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:05,688
What's on today's episode?
Panty flash? Nip slip?

330
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:08,297
- Zip it. The show's been cancelled.
- Oh, you tease.

331
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,284
Will you move?
I'm trying to get to class.

332
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:14,786
I can get half the student body at Golden Hill
to tune in if you girls go topless.

333
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:16,848
- Leave her alone.
- Cameron?

334
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,967
- Or what?
- Or I'll make you sorry.

335
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:25,677
Fight! Fight! Fight!

336
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,602
- You're about to eat a pain pizza.
- Cameron!

337
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,702
I know what I'm doing.

338
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:35,150
Pick on somebody your own size.

339
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,825
- Cameron, are you okay?
- I'm fine-- fine.

340
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:43,807
I would've kicked his ass.

341
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,134
I have a gold belt
in the art of tae kwon do.

342
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:48,110
Luckily, it didn't come to that.

343
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:50,759
But thanks for trying
to defend me, Cameron.

344
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,181
You're the sweetest guy I know.

345
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:03,785
What?

346
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,700
Who's the one who got
the hug, smart guy?

347
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,052
Yours truly.

348
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,558
That's right.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
