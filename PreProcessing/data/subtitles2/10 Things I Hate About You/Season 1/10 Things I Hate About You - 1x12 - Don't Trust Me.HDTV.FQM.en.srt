00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:02,464
On "10 Things I hate About You"...

2
00:00:02,474 --> 00:00:08,201
Chastity, I have something to tell you.
I'm the one who kissed Joey.

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,323
Kat, just get in the car and drive.

4
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:15,182
I will see you at school tomorrow!

5
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,107
I heard some good news today.
Someone got suspended.

6
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:18,368
Who was it again? Oh, that's right,

7
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:19,758
it was you.

8
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,421
Thanks to you, I'm still
an Ivy League candidate.

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,354
You're also a liar. What?

10
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,583
This whole time, you've been telling
me this is about your principles.

11
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:28,084
You forgot to mention your
principles drive a motorcycle.

12
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:30,853
So it was Patrick's bag.
That's not why I left.

13
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:31,886
Dad!

14
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:40,567
Creamed corn for breakfast? You know,
corn comes in these cool little flakes now.

15
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,198
I'm not going to eat it.

16
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,728
I'm going to pour it in the
toilet and tell Dad I threw up.

17
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,726
Ah, trying to stay
home from school.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,525
Use minestrone.
It's more believable.

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,725
Do we have any? If I show my face,

20
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,423
Chastity will torture
me for being with Joey.

21
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:58,589
Ha, got you. Morning, Dad.
Hi, Daddy.

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,322
Morning, sweetie.
Creamed corn for breakfast?

23
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:03,989
Uh, yeah. I was in the
mood for something creamy.

24
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:07,422
Let me heat it up. Otherwise,
it might end up in the toilet.

25
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:10,989
Go get ready. Since your sister
lost her driving privileges,

26
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,322
I'm taking you to school.
And I'll be riding the bus,

27
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:16,622
which is totally fair.

28
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:22,489
I accept my punishment without protest.
Dad, enough with the silent treatment.

29
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:25,157
How can I earn your trust back?
Drug test? Polygraph?

30
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,824
I'll do anything.

31
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,857
Okay. Stop seeing that
deep-voiced man-boy.

32
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,658
Patrick Verona and I are
not seeing each other.

33
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,658
And even if we were,
which we're not,

34
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:37,992
you can't just tell me to stop.
Oh, I thought I could.

35
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:40,493
Let's compare copies of
the parents' handbook.

36
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:45,694
Oh, wait. You don't have one.
It's not his fault I got suspended.

37
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,028
I see. He's not the killer.

38
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,362
He just happens to be around
whenever a body shows up.

39
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,230
Kat, you lied to me.

40
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:53,597
You didn't do that before
you met him. I didn't lie.

41
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,998
I just didn't mention it because
I didn't want you to overreact.

42
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,899
I was trying to prevent this.

43
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:04,400
So you were just being considerate.
Pardon me for not saying thank you.

44
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:05,601
I don't trust him.

45
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:09,703
Forget about him. Trust me.
That's the problem.

46
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:11,537
Now I don't trust you around him.

47
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,971
Dad, you don't even know him.

48
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:15,605
You're right. I should
get to know him better.

49
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,540
Invite him over for dinner.
You can't be serious.

50
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:24,463
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU Episode 12:

52
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:36,249
Five alive, I've been
looking for you all morning.

53
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:38,551
You won't believe this awesome
dream I had last night.

54
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:42,285
I had just shaved my chest,
and you were rubbing warm oil--

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,653
Joey, no PDA.

56
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:46,954
Why not? Chastity knows
we're together now.

57
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:48,921
Because I had a dream, too,

58
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:50,955
where she assaulted me
with a frozen yogurt

59
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,991
and then threatened to kill me.
Oh, wait. Not a dream.

60
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,959
Relax. It's been a whole weekend.

61
00:02:57,993 --> 00:03:01,494
I'm sure she's over it by now.
Here she comes.

62
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,896
No, seriously though,
your hair looks amazing.

63
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,231
It's like this peaceful
waterfall of wonderful.

64
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,899
That's exactly what
I was going for.

65
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:12,122
Hi, Chastity. Love the new look.

66
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,182
See? She didn't even say anything.

67
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:28,910
I told you she'd be over it.
Joey, you don't understand girls at all.

68
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:32,979
I'm being iced out. Come here.

69
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,615
Later. Later.

70
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,586
Hey, Cameron.
Boy, you're hard to find.

71
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,753
I've got some bad news.

72
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,421
You've made the superlatives page.

73
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,623
Oh, let me guess. Most likely
to fart during an oral report.

74
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:54,026
No, nothing like that.
You're Mr. Dependable.

75
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,227
No, that's worse.
Really? That's hard to believe.

76
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:58,595
Mr. Dependable?

77
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,796
I'll be forever
pegged as a doormat.

78
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:04,865
And why "Mister"?
It sounds vaguely emasculating.

79
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:09,535
Come on, it's not that bad.
Mr. Rogers. Mr. Belvedere.

80
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,271
There's Mr. T. I pity the
fool who forgets him.

81
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:16,308
Girls don't want to date Mr.
Dependable.

82
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:19,378
They want to date Mr.
Quarterback or Mr. Sixpack

83
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,347
or Mr. Stupid Jerk.

84
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:27,051
Some girls would appreciate a guy

85
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:29,853
who's dependable enough to
respond to a simple text message.

86
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,823
Oh, Lexie.

87
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,692
You know about the photo shoot.

88
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:36,761
You've been anointed Ms.
Dependable.

89
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,262
Me? You're kidding.

90
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,963
This is Cameron.
He's Mr. Dependable.

91
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:47,239
I hear they're calling
us the dream team. Funny.

92
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:50,275
Well, I'll see you at
the shoot then, Mister.

93
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:51,843
Look at you,

94
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:54,579
getting your flirt on.
I don't know where that came from.

95
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:04,187
Dream team. Hi, everyone.

96
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,157
I brought everyone chocolate chip cookies--
warm, right out of the cafeteria oven.

97
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,995
Come on, Chastity's not even here.

98
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,197
Does anyone hear a little
mosquito buzzing around?

99
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:19,333
It's so annoying.
I wish it would go away.

100
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:22,536
Look, I'm sorry for what happened.
I really am.

101
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,371
I just want to be friends again.

102
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:27,173
Yeah, can't we-- You should have thought
of that before you broke the girl code.

103
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,509
But Joey and Chastity
were already broken up.

104
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:33,212
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the girl code says
you can date a friend's ex if she's moved
on.

105
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:37,148
But you need permission first.
And at least two witnesses.

106
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:39,317
But then nobody could date anybody.

107
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:41,886
Okay, the girl code clearly
states, and I quote,

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,888
even if the first
girl gives permission,

109
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,890
she could just be saying
it without meaning it,

110
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:47,892
so the second girl should
be sensitive enough

111
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:52,230
not to force the first girl to spell it out,
thus making her feel worse.

112
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:53,498
End quote.

113
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:56,567
Okay, Miss South Carolina,
that made no sense.

114
00:05:56,602 --> 00:06:01,840
Let me make it clear for you.
You violated a sacred trust,

115
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:04,308
and now none of us wants to
be friends with you anymore.

116
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:09,509
Right, girls? Mm-hm.
I get it. I'm in Siberia.

117
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:12,512
But can't you just
leave me one friend?

118
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,514
How about Dawn? You always
said her voice was too nasal.

119
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,182
I'll do anything--

120
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:21,519
Wash your uniform,
flat-iron your hair, just name it.

121
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:24,922
I don't know. How about
you break up with Joey?

122
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:27,190
What?

123
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:30,859
But there has to be something else. Nope,
that's it. That's what you have to do.

124
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:35,530
You break up with him,
and I'll give you your life back.

125
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:39,399
Mm, cookies. Yummy.

126
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,202
Mandela.

127
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,537
Hey.

128
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,205
Hey. I was looking for
you at lunch today.

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,707
I feel like I haven't
seen you in ages.

130
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,375
It's kind of hard,
trying to make time for friends

131
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,477
when you're in a new relationship.

132
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,880
Patrick Verona and I are
not in a new relationship.

133
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,215
We hung out twice. Who knows if
I'll ever hear from him again?

134
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,051
Well, I-- Hey.

135
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,854
I just need two seconds.
It's fine. I got to go anyway.

136
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,791
Call you later.
PATRIK I just got your text.

137
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,527
What's this stupid thing
you want to ask me?

138
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,763
Okay. You know how
my dad is insane.

139
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:18,500
He made me watch a slide show of
some chick giving birth, so yeah.

140
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:21,102
Now he wants you to come
to dinner. I'll pass.

141
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:23,904
I told you it was stupid, but he's
afraid you're a bad influence on me.

142
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:28,608
Huh. I wonder why.

143
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:32,378
Look, if you don't come over,
he says we can't hang out.

144
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:35,546
He never has to know.
This is really, like, high school 101.

145
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,482
But my dad doesn't trust me anymore,
and I'm not going to lie to him again.

146
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:42,251
It's just lasagna. In or out?
I don't do family dinners.

147
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:46,088
So that's your answer? Yup.
Fine. See you around.

148
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,291
Oh, hi, honey. How was your day?

149
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,459
Did you invite the man-boy?
He's not coming to dinner.

150
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:08,094
He didn't want to submit
to the Inquisition.

151
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:11,297
Are you happy now?
Of course I'm not happy.

152
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:15,101
Kat, if this boy really liked you,
he'd make the effort.

153
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:19,637
Thank you for saying that out loud, Dad.
That really makes me feel so much better.

154
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,973
Oh, Kat.

155
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:28,211
"No more Mr. Man-Boy!
We won't see the man-boy!

156
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,380
"She won't kiss the man-boy."

157
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:37,985
Bianca.

158
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,985
Dawn, can we talk? We can't.
This is killing me,

159
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,154
but if Chastity finds out,
she will ice me out too,

160
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,922
and last year, Jenny Young got
iced out so bad, she had to move.

161
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,024
I don't want to move.
Our house has a pool.

162
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,659
But I miss you so much.

163
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,327
Yesterday, John Gosselin
did something super skeevy,

164
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,029
and I had nobody to share it with.

165
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:57,999
Oh, my God, this is so not fair.
Can't we figure something out?

166
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,102
I mean, you're on my
maid of honor short list.

167
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:03,871
Oh, my God.
You're on my short list.

168
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:08,274
Maybe you should dump Joey.
You've only been dating a week,

169
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:10,510
and we're going to be at
each other's weddings.

170
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:13,479
But he's so cute,
and I like him so much.

171
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:16,614
But I'll be there for you
every step of your sadness.

172
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,750
We'll pig out and watch trash TV,

173
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:21,986
and before you know it,
you'll be on to the next guy.

174
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,188
I'd hug you, but Chastity
might smell you on me.

175
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,194
Well, well, well, Ms. Dependable.

176
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,896
We meet again.

177
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,031
Mr. D. What a surprise.

178
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:39,633
I was wondering whether
you've selected your attire

179
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,469
for tomorrow's festivities.

180
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:46,039
I would hate for us to clash.

181
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:49,709
Well, why don't I
give you my number,

182
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:52,378
and you can call me tonight and
we will work something out.

183
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:58,315
Oh, hey, can I borrow a
pen and a piece of paper?

184
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,652
Yeah, I just-- I need to write
this down before it smudges.

185
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:06,723
It's a girl's number. I am on fire!

186
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:15,165
Hey, Five-o, did you hear?
We were just named cutest couple.

187
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,069
I was just putting together a list
of poses that best convey cutest.

188
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,205
Joey, you really
shouldn't be doing that.

189
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,007
But I'm a model. It's what I do.

190
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:27,144
No, I mean I told them we
can't accept the honor.

191
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:30,447
But who's cuter than us? No one.

192
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,349
Chastity's convinced all
the other cheerleaders

193
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:35,119
that I'm breaking the girl code.

194
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:36,954
The thing is,

195
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:42,473
I have to choose between my
friends and you. Man, that sucks.

196
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:47,698
Wait, you're not choosing me?

197
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:51,901
Joey, this past week with
you has been amazing.

198
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:55,037
But we're just high
school sweethearts.

199
00:10:55,072 --> 00:11:00,777
Who knows if we'd even last till prom?
But high school girlfriends last forever.

200
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,947
Okay. First of all,
you're not choosing me?

201
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:07,984
But I'm Joey Donner,
captain of the football team.

202
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,986
Plus, they just voted
me best profile

203
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:14,156
and whitest teeth and flattest abs.

204
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,993
And further plus...

205
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:22,797
I'm a good guy. I'm sorry.

206
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,334
Okay, then.

207
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:29,505
But just think about this-
If your friends were really your friends,

208
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:35,144
would they make you choose?
I can't believe you didn't pick me.

209
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,883
Joey, wait.

210
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,028
Hi, Dad.

211
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,697
What's all this?
Just making some dinner.

212
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:59,534
Bianca's not hungry,
so that just means more for us.

213
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,036
Ham? You don't eat ham.

214
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,406
No, but Patrick Verona does.
I asked him what he wanted for dinner,

215
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,176
and he said ham. He's coming here?

216
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,645
Yes. He confessed that the
reason he freaked out yesterday

217
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,815
is because he's starting to feel
such strong feelings for me.

218
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,319
He felt really vulnerable.
He said that? Mm.

219
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:24,323
Vulnerable. With his deep voice.

220
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,657
Mm-hm.

221
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,659
Honestly, Dad, asking him to dinner

222
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:30,028
is the best thing that
could have happened to us.

223
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:33,666
It's pushed us into this
whole new level of intimacy,

224
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,340
so thank you. Oh, there he is.

225
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,176
Can you get that?
I have to check the ham.

226
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,146
Look at me,
using a meat thermometer.

227
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:50,386
Hey, Dr. Stratford.
Hey, babe. Mm, I smell ham.

228
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:06,885
Okay, enough of that. I have a fork,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

229
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,926
So Patrick, tell me about your family.
My dad's a tattoo artist.

230
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,996
In fact, when he gets out of debt,
he wants to open his own shop.

231
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,001
He's kind of a dreamer. Oh. I see.

232
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,670
And does your mom work? Yes, sir.

233
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:31,342
I guess you could call her a dancer. Honey,
broccoli? No. I don't eat anything green.

234
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,676
Right.

235
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:39,550
So what are you interested in studying at
school? Well, I've always wanted to be an
astronaut.

236
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:42,019
An astronaut? Really?

237
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,421
I hope you're working
hard at science and math.

238
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:47,857
Mm. Well, my back-up plan
is to bum around Europe.

239
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:50,993
How fun would that be?
Not as much fun as college.

240
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,996
But, Dad, I could defer for a year.
Get a little life experience under my belt.

241
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,331
Nothing goes under your belt.

242
00:13:57,901 --> 00:13:59,835
We'll talk about this later.

243
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,705
So Dr. Stratford,
can I ask you something? Sure.

244
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,107
You're a gyno. What's up with that?

245
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:09,043
What do you an? I mean,
isn't it weird?

246
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,746
Like, do you ever run into one
of your patients at the market

247
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,416
and think "Ooh"? That's it.
Okay, it's not weird.

248
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,818
And I can't believe you asked
me that at the dinner table.

249
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:20,320
Not only are you nowhere near
qualified to be an astronaut,

250
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:24,492
you are nowhere near qualified
to see my daughter. Get out.

251
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:30,176
Get out. What's so funny?

252
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:35,169
Dad, we made all of that up.
You've been punked.

253
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:45,009
That went well. He deserved that.

254
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,010
Was that true about your parents?

255
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:48,378
Just one of them.

256
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,250
Hey.

257
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:14,002
Who did this? Oh, it wasn't me.

258
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:17,305
But whoever did it should
know that I'm a huge fan.

259
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,706
Huge.

260
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,909
Chastity, I get it.
I'm dating your ex.

261
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,980
And even though I've
apologized multiple times,

262
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:27,015
I understand why you're mad at me.

263
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:31,052
But what I don't understand is why
the rest of you are icing me out.

264
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:34,989
Oh, my God. We had this conversation.
The girl code, remember?

265
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,857
Or do you need another recitation?

266
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:41,528
Brittany, who loaned you a fresh pair
of shorts when you needed them the most?

267
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:42,895
You did.

268
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,732
And, Caitlin, who stopped you
from cutting your own bangs?

269
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:48,466
You did.

270
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:53,337
And, Dawn, have you forgotten
all of our fun adventures?

271
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:57,341
Our web kiss, our raging party.
Those were fun adventures.

272
00:15:57,376 --> 00:16:02,747
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. We get it.
I thought you guys were my friends.

273
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:06,117
I broke up with Joey so
we could stay friends.

274
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:09,954
And then, a second later,
I got back together with him,

275
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:13,291
because I realized real friends
would never make me choose

276
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:17,528
between them and my totally hot,
wonderful new boyfriend.

277
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:34,509
And that concludes this amateur production
<i>of Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Thank
you.</i>

278
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:45,789
Oh, here they are-
our cutest couple, right on time.

279
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,790
Mandela.

280
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:51,225
Yeah, hi. Kat, this is-- Oh,
no, no, no. Hell, no.

281
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,995
You did not tell me she was
going to take the picture.

282
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,633
I told you, Baby, we're just good friends.
Friends? Uh-uh. She's no friend of mine.

283
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,836
Why did she just spit on me?

284
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,606
That's my new girlfriend, baby.
She's sweet, but crazy jealous.

285
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:11,277
Is it weird I find it hot?
Hello? Mandy, I'm waiting.

286
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:14,947
I'm sure she'll calm down,
some day, but in the mean time,

287
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,315
it's probably best
if we don't talk.

288
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,285
This is just plain disrespectful.
I'm out of here.

289
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,822
Baby, wait. Good luck with Patrick.

290
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:30,627
Ms. D, we are eagerly awaiting
your presence at the photo shoot.

291
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,462
Now, I don't know if you
got any of my voice mails

292
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:33,897
or text messages last night,

293
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,031
but I did indeed go

294
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,634
with the khaki pants
and a sports jacket,

295
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:41,046
so that should go with just
about anything. Any-Hoo,

296
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:46,141
This is Mr. D, signing off.
Okay, Dependables, you're up.

297
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,013
But Lexie isn't here yet,
and she hasn't returned any of my calls.

298
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:53,383
I'm worried she may not be
that dependable after all.

299
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,985
Oh, you mean Lexie Greenburg.

300
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,153
Yeah, Kat got her confused
with Lexie Greenblatt.

301
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:59,422
She's our real Ms. Dependable.

302
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:04,928
Okay. Not a loss. It's fine.
It's totally fine.

303
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:08,266
I flirted with a cute girl,
and she gave me her number.

304
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,934
I call that a step in
the right direction.

305
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,370
Whatever, dude. Let's just take
the picture. Come on. Let's go.

306
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,306
Come on, come on. Hey, thanks, Kat.

307
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:22,612
I smell ham.

308
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,982
Hey. Just wanted to make sure your
dad didn't lock you in the basement.

309
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:29,219
Luckily, we don't have one,
but it's still kind of tense.

310
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,620
You know what? I think it's cool
how upset he gets about you.

311
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:36,623
It shows how much he cares.
Guess what.

312
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,292
Congratulations, you guys
were named Cutest Couple.

313
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,362
People love their Katrick. No.

314
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:45,965
You made the right decision, Fiver. I'll be
your best friend and your boyfriend.

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,302
Thanks, Joey, but it's not the same.
See, when I get a text from you,

316
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,972
who am I going to talk to about how
long I should wait till I text you back?

317
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,307
And how am I going to
dissect your every move?

318
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:58,509
It's not as much fun
if I do it with you.

319
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:01,378
Hey, Bianca. We're making a
smoothie run. You want to come?

320
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,247
What about Chastity?
We told her that you're our friend,

321
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:08,918
and we're not going to ice you out.
Still, we should grab some for Chastity.

322
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:11,053
Well, I'm just saying.

323
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:14,691
Are you okay if I-- Go, have fun.
I'll call you later.

324
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,560
Hey, guys, wait up.

325
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:21,131
Oh, my God. I am so going to mention
this moment in my toast at your wedding.

326
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:35,145
Are we going to talk about this?

327
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:40,484
Dad, you're an adult.
Use your words.

328
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,290
What you did to me last night
was very mean-spirited.

329
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:49,559
Hey, you started it.
Really? How so?

330
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,127
You made me invite
Patrick over for dinner

331
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:53,263
because you were hoping
it would scare him off.

332
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:57,600
Don't be preposterous.
And even if I did, can you blame me?

333
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:00,636
You were disobeying rules,
getting into trouble, disregarding me--

334
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:03,606
I'm not going to just sit by and watch
while your life spirals out of control.

335
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,307
I'm your father. I know.

336
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,976
But if you keep this up,
I'll be forced to go underground and lie,

337
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,143
like every other teenager.

338
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:11,312
Then you really won't
be able to trust me.

339
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:14,448
Is that what you want? God, no.

340
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:21,987
Why is this happening? Nothing's
happening. I'm just growing up.

341
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:24,022
Well, stop.

342
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,161
You were always the one I never
had to worry about, but now...

343
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,197
I have no idea how to do this.
Your mom...

344
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,001
There is no parent's handbook.

345
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:41,737
I just made that up. Really?

346
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:46,675
Dad, you're a great father.
You've raised me well.

347
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,145
I'm not going to surround
myself with shady people.

348
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,347
You said yourself you
don't even know this guy.

349
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:55,817
I don't. But if I learn he's bad news,
he's gone. I promise you.

350
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:59,186
I'm still not happy.
That dinner was scary.

351
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,958
You're telling me. I made a ham.

352
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:06,660
Want to watch the game?

353
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:18,672
