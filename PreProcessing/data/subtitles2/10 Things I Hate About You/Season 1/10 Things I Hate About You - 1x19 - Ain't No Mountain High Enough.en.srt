1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,199
<i>{On... Ten Thing I Hate About You...}</i>

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:05,634
-I think we should give it a shot.
-I do, too. -Is that what this is?

3
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:11,372
Your master plan to get me to sleep with you?
-I love you, Bianca. -Oh, my God. I love you, too.

4
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:14,008
Just because I want to have sex
doesn't mean I should.

5
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,375
I've been fooled by guys
like you before,

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,944
but not his time.
<i>I'm on The Biggest Poser.</i>

7
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:19,711
I leave for New York tomorrow.

8
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:44,963
-I miss my boyfriend.
-Joey left two days ago.

9
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:48,064
I can still smell his body spray.
-That's because I'm wearing it.

10
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:52,633
To remember him.- He's not dead. He's just on
 a reality TV show, which is probably worse.

11
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:55,235
-At least there's dignity in death.
-Could you show a little compassion?

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,505
This is his locker.
We shared so many kisses here.

13
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,373
Here's a novel idea,
why don't you call him?

14
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,542
Then he can listen to this
instead of me.

15
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:06,577
I can't. He's sequestered in the model house,
and they only have one phone.

16
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:08,278
Last night, some girl
told Joey to hang up

17
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:09,646
or she'd scratch his face.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,781
I'd give anything to hear
the sound of his voice.

19
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:14,450
The Buddha says, "Desire is
the root of all suffering."

20
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:15,584
Thanks, fortune cookie.

21
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,185
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,321
The fact that you want Joey to call
is creating the pain you're feeling right now.

23
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,990
So what? I shouldn't
want him to call me?
Exactly.

24
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,793
So you're not dying to talk to Patrick
about the other night?

25
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:28,928
If I wanted to talk
to him about it,
I'd call him.

26
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,430
He's not in a model house.

27
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:33,398
I'm walking my path,
and he's walking his.
I wish him well.

28
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:38,736
You're so deluded.
Whoa, wait a second.

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,370
Why is Dad talking
to Miss Tharp?

30
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:46,461
Maybe he worried you're an android. 
Oh, my God, they're dating.

31
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,712
<i>âª Hey, hey âª</i>

32
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:02,754
Bianca, calm down. Try and imagine we're bamboo
gently bending in the wind.

33
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,490
And hurricane Tharp
is about to rip us to shreds.

34
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:06,924
We don't know they're dating.

35
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,026
Maybe they were reminiscing
about your fake intervention.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,129
I am an expert on fliy dy language.
She did the hair flip/arm squeeze

37
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:17,867
which means they've been on two dates
and they've made out with tongue.

38
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:20,836
What are we going to do
about this unholy union?

39
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,104
We support Dad.

40
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:23,939
We've been wanting him
to date for years, remember?

41
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,373
Someone age-appropriate
who workat the hospital,

42
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:28,642
not the crazy lady from school
with zero boundaries.

43
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,144
Dad's coming.

44
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:33,313
-If you say anything, I will hurt you.
-I thought Buddhists were nonviolent.

45
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:37,351
-I'm a beginner. -Hi, girls.
-Hi, Daddy. -Hi, Dad.

46
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:40,287
-How was your day?
-Uneventful. -Yep.

47
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,422
They ran this guy's shorts
up the flagpole at lunch.

48
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:43,657
That was funny.

49
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:45,158
And then we saw you
flirting with Miss Tharp.

50
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:46,526
Bianca.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,325
She thinks you two are dating.
What? That's absurd.

52
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,724
Alright, I'm not going
to lie to you.

53
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,092
We've been on two dates.
Told you.

54
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,526
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner,

55
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,461
but I wanted to wait till I
knew it was something special.

56
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,062
See, Bianca?
It's nothing special.

57
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:04,999
Actually, it is.
Or it could be.
I don't know.

58
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,400
She's funny
and surprising and--

59
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,868
20 years ynger than you

60
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,236
and our guidance counselor
and a weirdo.

61
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,638
She's different,
and like her.

62
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,573
And when I'm around her,
I feel alive again.

63
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:17,342
You know how, like,
when your foot goes asleep

64
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:18,743
and you shake it
and it gets tingly?

65
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:19,811
[chuckles]

66
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,046
Ew, now you're bringing
feet into this?

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,180
Girls, you know yore

68
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,115
the mo important things
in my life.

69
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,083
I won't date Miss Tharp
if you tell me not to.

70
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:29,986
Okay, then don't.
All right.

71
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:36,056
I'llust be really sad.
But that's okay

72
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,326
because your happiness
is more important than mine.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,828
Dad, we would never dream
doing something so selfish.

74
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:42,829
Would we, Bianca?

75
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,930
[sighs]

76
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:48,000
Why don't you invite her over for dinner
so that we can get to know her better?

77
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:51,202
-Really?
- [phone rings]

78
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:55,439
It's Darlene. Should Iet it ring one more time
and not be too eager?

79
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:59,676
Or what if she hangs up?
Darlene, are you there?

80
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:04,614
Oh, hi. Nothing.
[gong]

81
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:13,087
And breathe... in through theight nostril
and out through the left.

82
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,866
[gong]

83
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,936
Everyone, slowly return
from nothingness.

84
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,372
Now, I know
our meditation collective

85
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:39,709
has no official leader,
but I have a few announcements.

86
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:42,411
First of all, welcome, Kat Stratford.

87
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:48,251
Kat, we're excited to be
a part of your journey.

88
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:51,788
<i>Namaste.
-Namaste.</i>

89
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:57,560
Second, there are still a few spots open
on our study abroad trip to Nepal.

90
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:01,397
Anyone else like to join us?
-I'm in.

91
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:03,499
Wonderful. I'll get you
the paperwork.

92
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,104
[phone rings]

93
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:15,641
- Oh, my God, Joey, I miss you so much.
- I miss you more than my mom.

94
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,641
I can't wait to hear about
all your modeling adventures,

95
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:20,442
but first, I have to tell you
about the insanity I'm dealing with.

96
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:26,180
My dad is dating Miss Tharp. No way.
Nice job, Dr. Stratford.

97
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:27,782
Joey, this is not good news.

98
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:31,184
Old people settle down fast
so that they won't die alone.

99
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,319
What if she becomes
my stepmom?

100
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:35,655
Calm down, Bianca.
Here's what you should do.

101
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:38,657
I have to call my baby girl
before bedtime.

102
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:43,562
Joey?
Joey, are you there?

103
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,598
Why do they only have
one phone?

104
00:05:56,005 --> 00:06:00,674
Okay, come on. You can do it.
Swim upstream, little salmon.

105
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,978
Is there any way I can
persuade you to keep moving?

106
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,880
I think we both
know the answer to that.

107
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:09,314
What's this?

108
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,683
It's an invite
to my little sister's
birthday party.

109
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:17,621
Princess theme. She asked me to...
All right, it's a love poem for Dawn, okay?

110
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:18,622
[laughs]

111
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:23,659
Did you write it in calligraphy?
So what if I did? Look, last night

112
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:27,963
on the phone without thinking,
I said, "I got to get some Z's, Dawn,"

113
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:32,600
but I don't know if she was done talking.
Now I feel horrible.

114
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:35,368
So I wrote her a poem
to apologize.

115
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:37,769
For saying good night?
Nice backbone.

116
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,170
Well, better to tell Dawn
how I feel

117
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:40,371
than let her get away.

118
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,272
That's the moral
of every romantic comedy.

119
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:57,491
There. Now she'll know
how I feel in iambic pentameter.

120
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:58,525
Sorry.

121
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,934
What a lovely home.
Thank you.

122
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,201
It's so inviting.

123
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:10,736
<i>It's like I'm
on the set of Friends.</i>

124
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,737
[both laugh]

125
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:12,738
Jennifer.

126
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,139
<i>Bianca, you love Friends.</i>

127
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:18,042
Why don't you discuss this shared interest
while I check the lasagna?

128
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,477
[both chuckle]

129
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,080
<i>Hey, did you hear
Friends got canceled?</i>

130
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:28,218
Yes, but people love it
in reruns. And you know why I think that is?

131
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:30,220
Urban tribes are now
a substitute

132
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:33,356
for traditional families.
Yeah, plus it's funny.

133
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:37,126
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was meditating.

134
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:39,795
Dad, can I talk to you
about an amazing opportunity?

135
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,295
Kat, I have no interest
in a timeshare right now,

136
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,896
especially
when we have a guest.

137
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,230
Oh, hi, Miss Tharp.

138
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,899
<i>Namaste.
<i>Namaste, Kat.</i>

139
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,234
Dad, I want to go to Nepal.
And I'm sure someday you will.

140
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:51,769
How about next week?
Huh?

141
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,136
There's
a school sanction program

142
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,805
where I'd spend three months
in a remote village

143
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,573
in the Himalayas
helping them build a school.

144
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,141
Plus, the trip is led
by university faculty members

145
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:01,177
who'll teach courses
in East Asian history.

146
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,812
And the best part--
daily mediation at a monastery

147
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:08,082
with real Buddhist monks.
That sounds like the perfect trip

148
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:09,350
for someone else's daughter.

149
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:11,752
Let her go. I'll turn
her room into a gym.

150
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:15,889
I know that program, Walter.
It's very well run.

151
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:18,825
Not only do the students achieve
a higher level of consciousness,

152
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,027
but it looks great
on a college application.

153
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:26,465
Don't say no yet.
Just think about it.
I will.

154
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,967
After dinner. Would you
take a seat, please?

155
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,402
[Bianca]
So, Miss Tharp,

156
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:34,872
have you ever been married?
Bianca, what kind of a question is that?

157
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:37,874
No, it's okay, Walter.
I want this to be an open forum

158
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,076
where we can all
share our truths.

159
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,347
Great. So have you?
I have been engaged three times--

160
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,816
four if you count
this one night in Vegas.

161
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,283
But I haven't actually
quite made it down the aisle.

162
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,952
Oh, why not?
Bianca.

163
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,986
Well, it's a question
I am currently trying

164
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:57,421
to figure out in therapy.

165
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,790
Enough questions.
This is a family dinner, not a deposition.

166
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:04,359
Dad, I'm just trying to hear
Miss Tharp's truth.

167
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:05,660
- So have you ever been arrested?
- Biance!

168
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:06,728
[Walter and Kat]
Bianca!

169
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:10,665
What?
Yes, but I was young and naive.

170
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,667
Girls, please learn
from my mistake.

171
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:15,337
If a cute man asks you to carry
a package over the border,

172
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:17,540
don't do it.

173
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:19,142
Don't ever do
what cute men want,

174
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,143
unless it's me.

175
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,348
- Oh, my God, Joey?
- Babe, I've been missing...

176
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,549
Give that back, Dad.

177
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:29,184
Bianca, we have
a dinner guest.

178
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,353
You can talk to Joey later.
No, I can't.

179
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,289
You just sit there and be
polite or go to your room.

180
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,390
[phone rings]

181
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,793
I've been waiting for him
to call all day.

182
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,360
You're ruining my life.

183
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,130
Darlene, I'm sorry.

184
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:47,601
Bianca can be a bit over-dramatic.
A bit? It's like she's living in a telenovela.

185
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,369
[laughs]

186
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:50,637
Let's not let it ruin our meal.

187
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,116
[knock on door]

188
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:05,584
May I come in?

189
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,617
I don't mean to be rude,
but I don't want to share my truth

190
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:10,484
or do mirror work
or do any of that crap.

191
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,521
I just want to be alone.
I can tell how much you miss him.

192
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:18,357
I love him.
And he's gone.

193
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:20,459
And who knows
when the model phone
will be free again.

194
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:23,961
Oh, I remember what it
feels like to be your age

195
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:28,365
and in love.
His name was Diego.

196
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,000
When he got deported,
I thought my life was over.

197
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:34,203
And the worst part about it--
nobody took my pain seriously.

198
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:37,672
They're so insensitive.
I'm sure they're doing their best,

199
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:40,708
but not everybody's equipped
to give us what we need.

200
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:43,878
I'm here.
I'm a good listener.

201
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:49,919
Thanks, Miss Tharp.
Oh, please call me Darlene.

202
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:53,455
So how long have you guys
been together?

203
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:56,591
We've been together
for about two months.

204
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:03,030
Okay, Darlene, here I come.
1, 2, 3.

205
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,398
Oh, my God, I can't believe
we're wearing the same thing.

206
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,234
You look so cute.
So do you.

207
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:41,056
Here. I made you
some Nepalese tea.

208
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,358
<i>Or chaia,
as the Sherpas say.</i>

209
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:46,294
Katarina, I'm not going
to give you my blessing

210
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:48,095
to go halfway
around the world--

211
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:51,331
Correction.
Only 12,130 kilometers,
give or take a few.

212
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:55,001
Oh, is that all?
I didn't realize you could
come home on weekends.

213
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,304
I know it's far,
but this is an amazing opportunity.

214
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,874
And I'll be going off
to college in 18 months.

215
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:04,477
Consider this a dress rehearsal.
For a play I don't want to see.

216
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,546
I'm ready for this.

217
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,915
Please don't keep me from
going because you're scared.

218
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:11,517
I'm not scared.
I'm terrified.
Of what?

219
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:14,553
Of what? You're going to a place
without indoor plumbing or telephones

220
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:17,055
or parental supervision.
It's dangerous.

221
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,657
Some warlord's going to pay
seven goats for you.

222
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,659
Seven goats?
Yes.

223
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:23,793
Dad, you can just say no.
You don't have to insult me.

224
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:29,498
Please let me go.
Let you?

225
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,068
I've never let you do anything in your life.
It's always been one of my favorite things about you.

226
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:37,070
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

227
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,272
Please don't celebrate
till you're alone in your room.

228
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,449
All right.
Thanks, Dad.

229
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:49,218
And don't come back
with one of those rings
through your nose.

230
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,230
[phone vibrates]

231
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:08,669
Hey Joey, I'm in my new class.
-Hey, Good news

232
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:11,305
I made it to four
out of my six "go sees."

233
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,708
Oh, that's so-- Oh, goody,
a bejeweled cell phone.

234
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:18,243
Just what I always wanted.

235
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:21,712
But, Mr. Meanly,
it's a matter of life or death.

236
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:22,746
[chuckles]

237
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:25,315
[snoring]

238
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:40,947
- Hey. -Hey back.
-That's a really good look for you.

239
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,701
Thanks. I got it for my trip to Nepal.
I leave next week.

240
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,071
For three months.

241
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:57,547
It's this fascinating study 
abroad program. Cool. Have fun.

242
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:00,049
You, too.

243
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:04,587
<i>Your poem is the most romantic thing
any guy's ever done for me.</i>

244
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:07,990
<i>Even that time Chris Yu<i>scratched my name
on his guitar.</i>

245
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:10,860
I just wanted you to know
I couldn't live without you.

246
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:16,764
Aw, recite it to me again.
Hark, my Dawn.

247
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,369
You are the sweetest treat in the candy store.
I've tasted your sugar, and I want some more.

248
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,838
You're so hot
you melt my heart.

249
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,940
Lips, sweet and delicious,
like a mixed fruit tart.

250
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,944
You're cuter than Bambi,
an adorable baby fawn.

251
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:35,082
You light up my days,
my very own Dawn.

252
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:46,091
Check out all that natural beauty.
Eyeball exploding, right?

253
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:51,294
You guys are in for the journey of a lifetime.
Maybe even a few lifetimes.

254
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:52,562
[all laugh]

255
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:57,833
That's a little Buddhist humor.
Sindu, that is too funny.

256
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:02,869
I find your spirit infectious.
Thanks.

257
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,671
You're welcome.
Do you know our host families?

258
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,939
I'd like to start practicing
pronouncing their names.

259
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,108
The families live
in one-room huts.

260
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,411
It's a little crowded,
so we'll be sleeping in tents.

261
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,546
But it'll be spring,
so you know what that means.

262
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,948
It won't be too cold? Avalanche season.
But don't worry.

263
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:23,451
You'll each have a GPS tracker.
I haven't lost a student yet.

264
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:26,652
Just a toe.
Now, let's talk vaccinations.

265
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:29,854
You'll need hepatitis A and B,
typhoid, and tetanus,

266
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,422
but good news,

267
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:33,324
because of the new well
we dug last quarter,

268
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:36,728
you'll no longer need the
Japanese encephalitis booster.

269
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,998
One thing we can't vaccinate
against is dysentery.

270
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:41,299
[sighs]

271
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,435
I really wish we could, though.
But we can't. Questions?

272
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,772
It's a non-invasive process
that will really help you access your,

273
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:51,341
I hate to interrupt,
but this is an emergency.

274
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,979
Oh, okay, just give me a sec, Tanya,
and then we'll start the hypnosis.

275
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,880
Hey, what is going on, honey?

276
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,014
Joey called
during math class,

277
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:03,184
and Mr. Meanly took my phone away.
Darlene, please help me get it back.

278
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:07,855
Bianca, honey, in this office,
I'm not Darlene.

279
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,156
I'm Miss Tharp.

280
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,792
And Miss Tharp has
to support Mr. Meanly.

281
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:15,327
You should not be talking
on the phone during class.

282
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:18,629
But you know how hard it's been
for me to not talk to Joey.

283
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:21,164
Yesterday you called us
star-crossed lovers.

284
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,001
And Darlene was serious about that.
Really?

285
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:27,136
Because it sounds like
she was just sucking up to me

286
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,239
so she could date my dad.
-No, she would never do that.

287
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:35,077
In fact, if you want to process this tonight
over a pint of ice cream and a Katherine Heigl movie,

288
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,311
Darlene will be there.

289
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:39,661
Tell Darlene I said
"Thanks for nothing."

290
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,185
Bianca, be reasonable.
I am being reasonable, Dad.

291
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,553
She's the one with
multiple personality disorder.

292
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:55,856
Darlene said you were just upset
because she wouldn't give you your phone back.

293
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,958
I'd hardly call that
a severe mental illness.

294
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:00,126
This isn't about my phone.
It's the fact that she's

295
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:03,195
my guidance counselor and your girlfriend.
It's too confusing.

296
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,665
All right, why don't we
just invite her over?

297
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,836
And we'll share our truths.
After all , if there can be

298
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,671
a lasting peace in Northern Ireland
I'm sure we can work this out.

299
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:14,207
Dad, you don't get it.
I don't want to work this out.

300
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,775
Now, please just leave me
to my homework.

301
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,976
Bianca, wha-- It's too strange.

302
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:22,080
You said if we didn't want you
to date her, you'd stop.

303
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:25,581
So stop.
Okay, fine.

304
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:34,590
See you in our
next class, okay?
Siena, hey.
Hi.

305
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,827
Listen, I haven't been able to find
quick-drying snow pants anywhere.

306
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:41,763
Where did you get yours?
Oh, Kat, I didn't tell you?

307
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,032
I'm not going to Nepal.
You're not?

308
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,534
I realized
I don't like hiking,

309
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:52,971
which means I'll probably hate trekking.
But have fun. Take pictures.

310
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,475
Hey.
Hey back.

311
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:03,076
I'm glad I caught you
before you left for Nepal.

312
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,416
Really? Why?

313
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,190
Keith found this in the back of his van.
I know how much you like it.

314
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:20,594
Thanks.
I was wondering where it was.

315
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:24,698
In Keith's van.
Yeah, you said that.

316
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:34,272
I guess I'll see you around.
Have a safe trip.

317
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,579
Joey, I miss you so much.
I miss you more.

318
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:46,950
Co Liviette just fainted during our photo shoot,
so we have the phone until she revives.

319
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,718
Then she's going to want
to call her baby.

320
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,054
Goody, I hope she's out for a while.
We have so much to catch up on.

321
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:57,658
Tomorrow's makeover day. I'm so nervous.
What if they shave my head?

322
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,193
I don't know
how to work my skull.

323
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:01,694
Joey, there's something
I have to do right now.

324
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,330
Call me back later, okay?
But-- Love you. Bye.

325
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:07,033
[sighs]

326
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:08,402
<i>[Man on TV]
I'm on the other end.</i>

327
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,137
<i>Yo, Tom, I thought
you brought it.</i>

328
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,239
<i>You've got style.
You were sexy.</i>

329
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:17,211
Looks good. Can I have some?
Don't choke on it.

330
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:23,850
Look. I'm sorry I freaked out
about Darlene.

331
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:26,820
I was being selfish.
Was?

332
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:28,889
You mean you're not being
selfish anymore?

333
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:32,526
Listen, I know how it feel to want to talk
to someone so badly it hurts.

334
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,365
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I call her?
-Yeah, but...

335
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,400
I'm switching to the other
guidance counselor.

336
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:41,870
Deal. |Joey

337
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:45,975
Don't worry about your makeover.
I told you she'd come around.

338
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,844
Listen, are you free to see
a movie this weekend?

339
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:51,747
I have seen you model enough
to know you're a chameleon.

340
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,026
What are you doing out here?
The program recommends

341
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:06,464
we try out all our equipment
before the trip.

342
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:10,035
Can I ask you something weird?
Where will you go to the bathroom up there?

343
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:15,375
Oh, God. You're so brave, Kat.

344
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,477
I could never go to someplace
halfway around the world

345
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:20,113
where I didn't know a soul
or speak the language

346
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:24,486
or have any idea what I'm eating,
but it all sounds so exciting and exotic.

347
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:29,225
I don't want to go.
I like indoor plumbing.

348
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,463
I don't want to forage for roots
or wear snow pants.

349
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:38,904
And-- And what?
And he didn't try to stop me.

350
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:54,021
I'm stopping you.
I need you here.

351
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,724
Dad is still dating
our guidance counselor,

352
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,698
and based on their body language,
they're three dates away from having sex.
