1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,672
And pop, pop, pop, pop!

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:04,550
Pop, pop, pop, pop!

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:06,850
Turn, pop, pop, pop, pop!

4
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:08,708
Pop, pop, pop--

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,698
Ladies, I feel like I'm trapped
inside a jell-o factory.

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,524
Dawn, your booty needs to pop
like that whitehead on your chin.

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,627
Ah, look.

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,508
Someone who doesn't look like
Jessica Simpson having a seizure.

9
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:23,747
Finally.

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,487
Great form.
Firm and crisp.

11
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:30,625
Um, I'll handle the critiques.
You handle the football.

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,951
Bye-bye.

13
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:33,754
Bye-bye.

14
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:38,296
Bianca, hi.

15
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,659
Why are you not
in your penguin suit?

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,565
Good question.

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:48,438
I thought I'd learn the routine
because God forbid someone gets sick...

18
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,150
or hurt or pregnant.
Thanks a lot, Juno.

19
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,995
Ooh. Yeah.
You're the mascot.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,503
Embrace it or end up the girls' manager
of the softball team, okay?

21
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:02,211
Gather around, girls.
Gather around.

22
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:07,116
Now, you all elected me
head cheerleader.

23
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,398
And me vice head cheerleader.

24
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,977
Where was I?
You all elected me...

25
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:16,793
head cheerleader
on a platform of change.

26
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,948
And not just superficial change,
like featuring our hot girls more...

27
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:23,945
but a massive redirection
of our cheer program.

28
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:28,493
And today, at this very moment,
change has come to our squad.

29
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,855
Introducing the pom-pay.

30
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:36,019
A pom-pom so hot,
it erupts with school spirit.

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,170
The latest in cheer technology, and we are
the only squad in the state who has them.

32
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,560
Megan, enough.

33
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:52,461
They're a hundred bucks a pair.
Bring me checks by the pep rally, okay?

34
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:54,016
Um, Chastity...

35
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:57,755
some of our parents already feel
the uniforms are too expensive.

36
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:00,898
- We can't ask for more money.
- Seriously?

37
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:04,739
Okay, raise your hand
if you're poor.

38
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,608
We could have a fund-raiser.

39
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:15,559
- Yeah, I don't have time for--
- I'll plan everything. Don't worry.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,722
It'll be great.
I promise.

41
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,457
Okay. Ooh.
But no bake sale.

42
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:24,398
The last thing this school needs
is more fat people. Mmm.

43
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:40,301
My hero.
What else can you open?

44
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:04,167
Finally!
A fully formed female.

45
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:08,289
I am so over freshmen.
I do not find retainers hot.

46
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,964
What the hell are you doing in here?

47
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:12,046
My doctor says I suffer
from gender confusion.

48
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:15,346
Are you confused that a fully
formed female could kick your ass?

49
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,499
Oh, no. I'm confused about
how to get into your pants.

50
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,345
Ohh!

51
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,708
Ooh!
Such a tigress.

52
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:35,775
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

53
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,234
Blah.

54
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:46,145
Are you watching that documentary
on animal testing again?

55
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:48,412
I'd rather be looking
at bunnies without eyelids...

56
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,735
than these yearbook photos
I took today.

57
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:54,553
It looks like one of those herpes commercials
where everyone is so happy...

58
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,692
despite the fact
that they have herpes.

59
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:57,773
Herpes.

60
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,532
I know firsthand
that's nothing to smile about.

61
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,424
I'm a gynecologist.

62
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:10,251
* What a waste of time
the thought crossed my mind *

63
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:13,349
* But I never missed a beat *

64
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:17,944
* Can't explain the who
or what I was *

65
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:20,733
* Trying to believe *

66
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,701
* What would you do? *

67
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:25,641
- Kat, I need your help.
- Finally.

68
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,022
The first step is admitting
you have a problem.

69
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,608
The next step is making you
a brunette again.

70
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:32,652
Oh, my God.
That's so funny.

71
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,653
I need help thinking up
a fund-raiser.

72
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,471
- A fund-raiser?
- A fund-raiser?

73
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:41,088
Yeah, all I could think of is those commercials
for the skinny kids in Africa.

74
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,805
Okay, I'm gonna let that offense go
since this is for charity.

75
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,149
- What do you need to raise money for?
- New pom-poms.

76
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,640
- Okay, I'm done here.
- Why don't you try a car wash?

77
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,672
I remember the summer
before sophomore year--

78
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:54,382
Something really boring happened.
Awesome story, dad.

79
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:56,396
A car wash? I love it.
Thanks, daddy.

80
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,986
Great idea, dad.
Half-naked cheerleaders...

81
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,787
wet and soapy, standing on
the street asking for money.

82
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,273
- No car wash. No car wash!
- Daddy!

83
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:05,891
Can you get it?

84
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:08,967
Did I ever tell you about the cakewalk
for the badminton club?

85
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,487
- Multiple times.
- Dad, it's your girlfriend.

86
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:16,096
Mail me to another family.

87
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,621
Okay. But first,
here's your dad's package.

88
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,322
I don't wanna think
about my dad's package.

89
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,705
Carla, hi.

90
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,445
She's adorable.

91
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,999
Don't let her fool you.
She's 15. She's dangerous.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh, I was the same way.

93
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,909
Oh, now the only thing dangerous
in my life is the chance...

94
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,710
that one of these packages
has anthrax in it.

95
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:38,455
- You didn't order any, did you?
- Oh, uh, no. I was...

96
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,530
uh, it's a model plane.

97
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,276
That is sweet.
Here's your toy.

98
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,131
"Toy"? Model planes
are collectors' items.

99
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:46,835
Oh.

100
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:49,450
That I stage fake dog fights with.

101
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,490
And who am I to judge?
I am hooked on guitar hero.

102
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,689
I like to pretend I'm Stevie Nicks.

103
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,040
Well, before she started looking
like a Wiccan bag lady.

104
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,608
Guitar hero, huh?
What is that?

105
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:07,703
It's this guitar karaoke thingy.
You should come over sometime...

106
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:11,639
see for yourself. I got two guitars.
We could, uh, form a band.

107
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,535
I'd love to,
but I'm in a band already.

108
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,497
Of course you are.
Lesson learned.

109
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:21,670
Do not hit on a man
wearing rubber gloves.

110
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,542
Enjoy your package.

111
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:28,729
On behalf of all of us at World
Send Delivery, have a pleasant day.

112
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,594
Should we talk about
what just happened here?

113
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,447
I'd love to. But wait.
What's that I hear?

114
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,514
Bunnies crying.

115
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,075
- Did you understand what I said?
- See, that's the problem.

116
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:16,001
Great with the repeating,
not so great with the understanding.

117
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,093
But I'm guessing it was about flowers.
Props for bringing props, by the way.

118
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:23,126
- Actually, those are for--
- A carnation sale!

119
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,935
That's perfect.
You're a genius, Cameron!

120
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,077
I gotta start planning.

121
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,115
I almost took your flowers.
How rude.

122
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:39,462
Sacre bleu.

123
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,589
So I can't wait for you to see me in action
with these new pom-poms.

124
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,993
I just have to figure out how to wear
my hair with them, you know?

125
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,340
They have volume like my hair.

126
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:52,311
But I just don't want it to seem like I'm trying
to have my hair match the pom-poms, you know?

127
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:53,807
Joey, honey, I'm talking.

128
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,755
- <i>Well, thanks to the padua cheer squad...</i>
- Sorry- sorry. This sounds important.

129
00:07:56,756 --> 00:08:00,110
<i>...now you can, with one of these
beautiful carnations.</i>

130
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:03,486
<i>Red is for romance,
yellow for friendship.</i>

131
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:06,344
<i>Each fragrant blossom is only $2.</i>

132
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:10,703
<i>And all the money collected
goes to a very important cause--</i>

133
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:13,562
<i>The feed the skinny children
pom-pom memorial foundation.</i>

134
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:17,668
<i>Don't wait. Tell that special someone
just how you feel.</i>

135
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:21,215
Okay, let's go.

136
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,122
- Bye, Stacie. Bye, Mandy.
- Bye.

137
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:26,882
Use that last one. I had pouty lips
with just a hint of teeth.

138
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,995
Oh, too bad. I think I saw a glare
from your devil horns, Beelzebub.

139
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,999
Okay, I don't know what that means,
but I'm offended.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,421
You're sowing fear and misery
among the student body...

141
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:38,708
- just so you can buy new pom-poms.
- First, I don't sew...

142
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,653
and second, I'm giving people a chance
to tell someone they care.

143
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,354
It's actually kind of nice of me.

144
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,737
This is high school.
People don't tell each other how they feel.

145
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,673
That's what I thought.
But it turns out they really want to.

146
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:51,628
After all, we made over $400 today,
and I'm sure we'll double that...

147
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,822
once people have a chance
to steal from their parents.

148
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:56,364
People aren't buying flowers
to tell people they care.

149
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:58,332
They're hoping somebody's
gonna buy them one back.

150
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,749
Nobody wants to be the one loser
in the school without a flower.

151
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,976
Waa, waa. Sounds like somebody's afraid
she's not gonna get one.

152
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,492
Please. I don't need a stupid flower
to feel good about myself.

153
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:10,053
- That's your department.
- Wow. That's so not true.

154
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:13,617
So what happens tomorrow
if you don't get a flower?

155
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,311
I'll just go home sick...

156
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,072
and never come back.

157
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,338
Thanks.

158
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:27,703
- Two.
- Ooh.

159
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,184
Two carnations, $4.

160
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:32,749
Thank you.

161
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,455
- Red or yellow?
- It would be red.

162
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,559
One red carnation, please.
And I've already filled out the tag.

163
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,387
I like to be prepared.

164
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,013
Must be that boy scout training.

165
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,944
Two dollars.

166
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,378
Thank you.

167
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,055
Cameron, how's it going?

168
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,004
Oh, not so good.
I feel weird.

169
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:17,110
Ever since Bianca got here, my head
has been filled with rainbows and Enya.

170
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:20,442
The sooner I tell her how I feel,
the sooner I can get back to normal.

171
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,569
Wow. You actually think
you have a shot.

172
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,770
I applaud that positive attitude.

173
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,544
Thanks, P. Diddy.

174
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:30,939
I, uh, cashed one of my bar mitzvah
savings bonds so I could buy 100 flowers.

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,714
- You don't know that many girls.
- They're all for me.

176
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:36,853
Ooh.
That seems not right.

177
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:38,867
No. No, Cameron, it's inspired.

178
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:41,870
When the girls see me carrying
all these flowers, they'll wonder...

179
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,130
"Who's that guy?"
Yeah?

180
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,951
Or they'll think you're a float.

181
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:50,224
- Hey.
- Hey, Cameron.

182
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,449
- I'm here for my shift.
- Oh, thank God!

183
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:56,541
Hopefully this is the last time
I'll ever have to handle money.

184
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,846
- Credit is so much cleaner.
- Yeah.

185
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,234
I've been dying to see
if anyone sent me a flower.

186
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,531
I guess it's one of the perks
of being on the squad, huh?

187
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,738
- We get to peek.
- Oh, darn!

188
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,101
You're the mascot.
You don't have security clearance.

189
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,138
But I planned this whole thing.

190
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:16,488
So this must be shocking news for you.
Damn our strict intelligence policy.

191
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,551
But we can't change the rules for you
or we'd have to change them for everyone...

192
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,731
and then the terrorists win.

193
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,683
- I'm confused.
- I'll bet you are.

194
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:27,681
I'll see you
at the pep rally, okay? Bye.

195
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,755
One carnation.

196
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:34,190
Two dollars.
I'll just take that right there.

197
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:40,813
If Bobby doesn't send me a flower, I swear
I'll never give him a lap dance again.

198
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,848
Mind making room for someone
who actually wants to use the sink?

199
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:45,297
Wait your turn.

200
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,237
Oh! Yearbook photo girl.
Want a pic?

201
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:52,022
Thanks, but I have plenty of shots
of girls who desperately need...

202
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:55,301
attention from boys
to prop up their self-esteem.

203
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:58,914
Bye-bye.

204
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,532
That was awesome.
It's like your mouth knows kung fu.

205
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:08,683
High school is like Vietnam,
and these stupid flowers are Agent Orange.

206
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:12,002
So you're not hoping to get one?
Not even a teeny, tiny bit?

207
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:12,953
From who?

208
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,845
Every guy here has the depth
of an inflatable kiddie pool.

209
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:17,772
What about Patrick Verona?

210
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:21,086
I would rather lick that toilet seat.
Why would you even ask me that?

211
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:24,240
I just saw him in line
buying a flower, that's all.

212
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,700
That's impossible.
He would never--

213
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:29,872
Kat, other woman,
just pretend I'm not here...

214
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:32,204
especially if you were changing.

215
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,899
Mandella, pervy troll.
Pervy troll, Mandella.

216
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,140
Let's go.

217
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:51,841
Ah.

218
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,653
Is that it?

219
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,185
That can't be it.
Are you sure?

220
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,272
It's okay.

221
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:36,315
I showed you my flower.
Now you show me yours.

222
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,900
Leave me alone!

223
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:45,731
Just take this one
and shut up.

224
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:02,049
- You girls are late. Where were you?
- We were having sex with the soccer team.

225
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,074
- It took longer than expected.
- Funny. Young lady, come back--

226
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,494
Dad, usually I enjoy this,
but this time let it go.

227
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:10,210
She's had a tough day.
Nobody sent her a stinking carnation.

228
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,787
Oh. I see.

229
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:16,234
I'm sorry,
are you experiencing sympathy?

230
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,609
Don't get me wrong.

231
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:22,228
She really shouldn't let someone
else's opinion affect her like this.

232
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,927
Who cares if some guy she's barely met
didn't spend two bucks to buy her a flower?

233
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:29,402
I mean, really, all she knows about this guy
is that he's rumored to be a cannibal.

234
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,714
Still, when she didn't get one,
it upset her.

235
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:36,662
But what's even more upsetting
is that she let herself care in the first place.

236
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,359
She's so pathetic.

237
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:43,333
Poor Bianca.

238
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,196
I'm gonna go tell her
that she's right.

239
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:52,249
No guy should be able to make
her doubt how amazing she is.

240
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,172
But I'm also going to tell her...

241
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:57,459
that part of high school is getting hurt.
There's no way to avoid it.

242
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,525
She's just gonna have to learn
to pick herself up and move on.

243
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:09,705
You should tell her that.
She'd really appreciate it.

244
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:18,550
But to have any credibility at all,
you might wanna take off your wedding ring.

245
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,424
I can't believe it!

246
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,321
- Hey, Karen, want a flower?
- Uh-uh.

247
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,354
I got way too many yesterday.

248
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:33,621
Later.

249
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,382
Michael, what are you doing?

250
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:39,210
They waited until last period to pass out all
the carnations, so nobody saw me with these.

251
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:41,149
So I'm gonna get my money's worth.

252
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,550
Speaking of, was Bianca's flower
worth your two bucks?

253
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:47,213
I haven't heard from her,
but I'm choosing to be positive.

254
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:51,742
She's repulsed by me but cares enough
to not reject me in public.

255
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,893
- That's one theory.
- Nice basket, dork!

256
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,636
Good one, Ryan.
You got me.

257
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:03,278
- Hey, Bianca.
- I'm in such a crappy mood, Cameron.

258
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,297
Cheer me up,
and I'll love you forever.

259
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,169
I'll do my best.
Did-- did you like my flower?

260
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:10,688
- You sent me a flower?
- You didn't get it?

261
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,758
No, but this is great news.

262
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:14,729
It is?

263
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,287
Well, if you sent me a flower,
that means other people may have, too.

264
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:19,771
Okay. Ouch.

265
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,423
Chastity must've thrown them away.
I knew it.

266
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,030
She's still upset about finding
me and Joey in the closet.

267
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:27,388
Yeah, it was upsetting.

268
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,537
But destroying someone's flowers--
That's low.

269
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,971
Even for a popular girl.
Kat was right.

270
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,499
She is a teenage Long Duk Dong.

271
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:38,116
- I'm sorry, who?
- The dictator of North Korea.

272
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:40,317
It's okay.
I didn't know, either.

273
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:42,794
She shouldn't get away with this.

274
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:46,940
- You should call her out on it.
- She'd kick me off the squad.

275
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,330
Or maybe others would follow you.

276
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:52,859
- You could start a rebellion.
- Why would they follow me?

277
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,496
You don't even realize
your effect on people.

278
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:57,047
They're drawn to you.

279
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:00,698
They wanna be around you
all the time, forever and ever...

280
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,522
but not in a creepy way.

281
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:06,677
Thanks, Cameron.

282
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,751
So you'll still be my friend
if I have to join show choir?

283
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:13,658
Of course I will. And, uh, the AV club's
always looking for new members.

284
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,161
God, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

285
00:17:16,162 --> 00:17:16,912
Ouch.

286
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:20,618
Oh, and, Cameron,
thanks for the flower.

287
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:36,987
Get it through your head.
I'm not interested.

288
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,259
Gotcha.

289
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:52,674
Oh, my God!
These pom-pays are amazing!

290
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:55,064
- Whoo!
- Ten minutes, girls.

291
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,771
You heard her.
Ten minutes.

292
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:02,323
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

293
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,598
Someone in this group
has betrayed me.

294
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,015
In fact, she's betrayed the bonds
of cheerleader sisterhood...

295
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,577
and what makes it so much worse...

296
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:15,466
is that that person is in
a position of leadership.

297
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:24,288
- Chastity, I have something to say.
- And what would that be, mascot?

298
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,891
Michelle said you're too fat
to be on top of the pyramid.

299
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,896
No! What? No!
I didn't say that!

300
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:38,823
No! Girls, back me up.

301
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:41,471
No, she kind of did,
really loud.

302
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:47,655
May I speak with you?
Outside?

303
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:51,348
No, they're taking it out of context. I mean,
the next thing I said was, "just kidding".

304
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,712
- So, no...
- Outside.

305
00:18:57,283 --> 00:19:00,657
Ooh, she's gonna get it.
That was awesome.

306
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:09,139
- I have a package here for Dr. Stratford.
- That's me. Where's Carla?

307
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,856
Uh, she wanted to swap routes.
It's fine by me.

308
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:14,963
There are a lot of foxy
stay-at-home moms on this block.

309
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:18,002
Well, if you see her, tell her...

310
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,213
good luck.

311
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,175
Excuse me.

312
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,800
Which way are the foxy moms?

313
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,531
Shame on you.
You're married.

314
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,918
Let me guess, Officer.
I should be wearing a helmet.

315
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:45,832
I just have one thing to say to you:
I'm not that girl.

316
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,711
What girl?

317
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:49,453
The girl who's turned on
by this bad-boy crap.

318
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,314
I'm not skipping home to scribble in
my journal that maybe you're a vampire.

319
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:54,210
Noted.

320
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:57,088
You don't have to beat people up for me.
I can do that myself.

321
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:00,102
Oh, I'm sure you can.
But I didn't beat anybody up.

322
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:03,119
- Yeah, right.
- Scout's honor.

323
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,469
Now, do you mind?

324
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:10,511
Helmet!

325
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,444
I'm sorry, what?

326
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,446
What was that all about?

327
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,500
I don't even know. Come on.
Let's get out of this hellhole.

328
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:35,074
I wish I could,
but I've got detention.

329
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:38,859
- They finally found your graffiti?
- Um, yeah.

330
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,460
Bummer. All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

331
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,176
- Can't wait.
- Good bye.

332
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:45,041
* Just right *

333
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:48,535
* So light *

334
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,249
* Life is good when you're-- *

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
