00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,081
<i>Meat Is Not Green, huh?</i>

2
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:11,481
If it is, you probably
shouldn't eat it.

3
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:14,413
Don't mock.
This book is fascinating.

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,380
Did you know that 18% of the
world's greenhouse gas emissions

5
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:19,380
come from animal agriculture?

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,346
That is fascinating.

7
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:24,246
If everyone at this school ate vegetables
instead of processed animal flesh

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,079
just one day a week, it would
make a huge environmental impact.

9
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,613
Huh. What else can I do?

10
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,346
Is there, like, a
walk-a-thon or something?

11
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:32,680
No. If you don't want
to do it for the earth,

12
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,681
- do it for your colon.
- Come on, I'm eating.

13
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:38,615
I can see that.
Vividly.

14
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,382
- [bleats]
- [scoffs]

15
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,015
Okay. Recess is over.
Enjoy your carbon footprint.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,616
I'm going to go do
something about this.

17
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,350
Of course you are.

18
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:50,051
- Still want to hang out after school?
- Sure.

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,983
Hey, Cameron, this seat
has your name on it.

20
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:56,618
Well, actually, it says "Dee's nuts,"

21
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,818
but you can still sit here.

22
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:02,886
No thanks.
My friends are waiting for me.

23
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:08,318
Hey, guys.
Thanks for saving me a seat.

24
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:10,686
Anyone want my Fruit Roll-Up?

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,688
I can't believe he's still hung up on you.
It's been three whole weeks.

26
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:17,522
I wish he'd get over me so we
could go back to being friends.

27
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,189
Those Goth kids are
going to eat him alive.

28
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:21,023
Ooh, don't look now.

29
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,458
It's Max Morita.
I'm so in love with him.

30
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,460
I thought you were in
love with David Allen.

31
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:27,962
That was before he flirted with
Kelly Morris in front of my face.

32
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:29,931
That's so rude.

33
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,200
Eh, I'm over it. I've upgraded to
Max, and I couldn't be happier.

34
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:37,771
Oh, my God. Dawn, that's it.
What's it?

35
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,306
If we find Cameron someone else,

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,174
he'll be so happy we can
go back to being friends.

37
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,242
Bianca, are you saying what
I think you're saying?

38
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,443
[both] Matchmaking!

39
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:50,306
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU Season
1 Episode 14 MEAT IS MURDER

40
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:55,382
<i>Transcript by Addic7ed.com
and iSubs.coil.us.to Teams!</i>

41
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,307
What about Barbara?

42
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,974
She bites her nails and eats them.

43
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,975
Ugh.
Gina?

44
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,476
She just had a baby.

45
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,911
Oh, I thought she just
lost a bunch of weight.

46
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:09,546
What about her? Stacy.
According to her stats,

47
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,981
she's freakishly tall,
just like Cameron.

48
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:13,648
But I don't know if she's his type.

49
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,983
It says here she likes cats, hiking
in the foothills, and Celine Dion.

50
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,984
Cameron hates cats and hiking.

51
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:22,986
[cell phone rings] Ooh,
it's my future husband.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,320
Hi, Max.

53
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,254
[Dr. Stratford] Bianca.

54
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:27,255
So what's up?

55
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,423
No!
Really?

56
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:33,592
Uh-oh, you have "old person
trying to use the computer" face.

57
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,593
I can't figure out how
to uplink a photo.

58
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:38,761
Upload.
What's it for?

59
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,163
CyberSerenade?

60
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:44,932
A friend at the hospital convinced me
to sign up for this online dating site.

61
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,933
Oh, Dad, that's so great.

62
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,601
I don't know.
I haven't dated since...

63
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:49,935
Since Mom died.

64
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,537
Yes, but also since
I looked like this.

65
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:56,171
Hair?
Oh, my God.

66
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:58,105
My friend says

67
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
you should assume
everybody's 10 years older

68
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,441
and 50 pounds heavier
than their picture.

69
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:03,276
I figure when women
meet me, they'll think,

70
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,411
Well, he's bald, but at
least he can see his feet.

71
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:09,614
It says here you're interested
in Nora Ephron movies,

72
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,616
antiquing, and tending
to your herb garden.

73
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,282
We don't have an herb garden.

74
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,618
But we could. Think about it.
Fresh herbs, mm.

75
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:18,452
Dad, these are all lies.

76
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:21,955
My friend says to think of
them more as sales tools.

77
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,123
You're right.
He's an idiot.

78
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:27,893
No.
He is a genius.

79
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,228
Well, he is a brain surgeon.

80
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,430
Dawn, I have a great idea.

81
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:38,570
School spirit has
seriously been sagging

82
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,504
since we lost the girls' golf finals.

83
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,907
As spirit chair, it's my job
to lift people's spirits,

84
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:46,544
which is why we need
more funds for balloons.

85
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,913
Danica, this is a travesty.

86
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,581
If the balloon budget has been blown,

87
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,482
then we cannot afford to
just stick a pin in this.

88
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:55,152
Out of order. You must be recognized
by the president in order to speak.

89
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:56,821
Our president's asleep in his chair.
[snores]

90
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:59,824
A vivid example of why so few
surfers become great legislators.

91
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,425
I've got orchestra
practice in 15 minutes,

92
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,460
and I have to soak my reed.
Can we adjourn?

93
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:05,229
Motion to adjourn can only
be made by the president.

94
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,697
Is there any more business?

95
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:08,265
I have something?

96
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,701
Point of order, you must
be recognized by the...

97
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:14,938
The president recognizes the patient
young lady with the long brown hair.

98
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,239
Please continue.

99
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,942
I'm here to ask for your help.

100
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,944
Every day, the earth is
getting closer and closer

101
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,612
to cataclysmic climate change,

102
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,549
yet every year, we're burning
more and more fossil fuels.

103
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,218
It's time for our
generation to say enough.

104
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,887
We didn't cause this mess,
but we can clean it up,

105
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:32,889
and that starts right here, right now,

106
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:36,025
with your approval of
"Meatless Mondays".

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,660
But Mondays are pepperoni pizza day.

108
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:41,064
Allow me to share this short but
educational slide show on the urgent...

109
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,399
I don't have time for a slide show.
Can we table this?

110
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,902
Unlike Balloongate, this
actually is a serious issue.

111
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:48,070
If we stick a pin in it,
we're all going to die.

112
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:50,239
I doubt that'll happen
by our next meeting,

113
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:51,574
but I'll put you on the agenda.

114
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:57,280
Adjourned.

115
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,883
Welcome to hell.

116
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,720
You're lucky.
You're just visiting.

117
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,602
Cameron James?

118
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:21,605
He's one of the eight boys at
school who's taller than me.

119
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,607
Plus he's got great eyes.

120
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,209
But trust me, he's not interested.

121
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,377
Yet.

122
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,378
That's where we come in.

123
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,280
We are going to give you...

124
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:34,915
A makeover!
A makeover!

125
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,550
Oh, my God.

126
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,553
I've always dreamed of getting
makeovers from cheerleaders.

127
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:42,922
Wait, you're not going to pour
pig's blood on me, are you?

128
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:45,892
No, we just want to help you
reach your full potential.

129
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,560
This is so great.

130
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,062
I can't wait to see my new hair.

131
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:51,399
And when do I get to try on
all my different outfits?

132
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,403
Will I get to twirl around
while the sales girls applaud?

133
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,907
We only have until next period,

134
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:58,242
so we don't have time for
the full makeover montage.

135
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:00,945
But relax.
Dawn is a styling genius.

136
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,248
And I'll give you a crash course

137
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:05,416
on all of Cameron's favorite things.

138
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,152
Oh, my God, this is going to be fun.

139
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:11,255
This is Kate. She blew up the
trailer her stepfather was in,

140
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,125
but you learn later that she
was completely justified.

141
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:16,928
You love your old Legos

142
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,263
and refuse to give them away,

143
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:19,997
no matter what your mom says.

144
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,298
You're counting down the days

145
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,267
<i>until Toy Story 3 comes
out on June 18th,</i>

146
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,202
and he's going to college.

147
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:30,206
<i>? I don't know what
to do about her ?</i>

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,876
<i>? She's one of those
kind of girls ?</i>

149
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,546
<i>? So tell me what
to do with her ?</i>

150
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,881
Wow.
You look stunning.

151
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:40,881
Can I see?

152
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,883
Not till the big reveal.

153
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,552
Now we just have to find the
perfect place for them to meet.

154
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,553
Somewhere where she's back-lit.

155
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,589
Oh, yeah.

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,395
We did not get a chance
to officially meet.

157
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,463
Kat Stratford.

158
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:59,032
William Blankenship.
Everyone calls me Blank.

159
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,901
I wanted to thank you for trying
to intervene on my behalf.

160
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:04,237
Oh, I'm sorry I gave that impression.

161
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:06,306
Frankly, I couldn't care less
about your little crusade.

162
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,907
I just had a spontaneous outburst

163
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:09,409
because you're the first
American I've met

164
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:11,745
who's actually aware
there's an entire world

165
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,914
beyond the boundaries
of your jingoistic,

166
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:16,483
gluttonous, puffed-up
former superpower.

167
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:18,252
Okay.

168
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:19,920
I think there's some
common ground in there.

169
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,221
Different words, maybe.

170
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,357
I also noticed your hair.

171
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,825
I like brown hair.

172
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,526
It gives a woman an
air of intelligence.

173
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:28,028
Much like your English accent

174
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:30,297
gives you an air of
snobbish entitlement.

175
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,865
Oh, dear God.
It's not just an air.

176
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,468
You actually are intelligent.

177
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,537
And I want meatless Mondays passed.

178
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,540
Never going to happen.
This year's most sweeping piece of legislation

179
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:44,211
was the bold switch to
two-ply toilet tissue.

180
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,880
I agree. This school is filled
with apathetic mouth-breathers.

181
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:50,884
But this is a chance to actually
change things for the better.

182
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:52,752
Isn't that what politics is all about?

183
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:54,688
Aw, that's adorable.

184
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:57,423
Politics is about power.

185
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,225
Wait.

186
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,495
And this would show people that
the student council has it.

187
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,564
See?
Your ego wants to help me.

188
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:05,765
All right, I'm in.

189
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,633
Let's shake things up.

190
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:09,302
Give me your number.
We can strategize.

191
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:16,242
That was easy.

192
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,443
I'll call you.

193
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:23,783
Who's that guy?

194
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:27,019
- His name is Blank. - Blank?
Sounds like a douche.

195
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:29,722
Please don't use that word.
It's loaded with gender bias.

196
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,425
I know.
That's why I like it.

197
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:39,866
Hey, Cameron. I'm sorry, I'm
late for an awards ceremony.

198
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,202
Wait. I know you don't
want to talk to me, but...

199
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:44,871
Yeah, I know, and that's easier
to do when you don't talk to me,

200
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,205
so please don't.

201
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,541
Look, I'm just trying to do a
favor for my friend Stacy.

202
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,877
She has a huge crush on you.

203
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:54,213
Really? Your friend?
Stacy who?

204
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:59,083
Stacy. The cute, tall girl.
That's her right over there.

205
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:07,557
[Cameron] Wow.
That's not how she looked first period.

206
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:09,225
[Bianca] Girls are like flowers.

207
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,894
You'll never know when they'll bloom.

208
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,562
Listen, she's too shy to talk to you,

209
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,230
so if you're interested,
you better make a move

210
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,831
before some other guy snatches her up.

211
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:21,569
Oh, gosh. A move?
Which one will I pick?

212
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,905
<i>Just talk about Lost.
She's a huge fan.</i>

213
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,240
<i>Lost?
So am I!</i>

214
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:31,243
My theory about the smoke
monster will blow her mind.

215
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,946
It's the spirit of the island.

216
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:37,248
[Bianca] Great. I don't know why,
but I just have this feeling

217
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:39,916
you two are going to
really hit it off.

218
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,786
Thanks, B.
Hey.

219
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,489
- Hi.- So I hear you know
something about a plane crash.

220
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:53,893
So...

221
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,889
You need to go after the 3 swing votes

222
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,665
voting is all about exploiting the
weakness, desire or vanity of your target.

223
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,525
First up:
Tabitha 'out of order' Cook

224
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:04,478
She's more desperate for respect
than a washed up boy band.

225
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:11,294
Tabitha, you are the
face of student council.

226
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:13,098
I mean, you make the
announcements every morning

227
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,883
It's harder than it looks.

228
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,196
We don't even have a teleprompter.

229
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:20,355
That's why I need you to be the
face of "Meatless Mondays".

230
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,481
If this thing works,
it could go National.

231
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,718
-You could be interviewed on
-Fox News?

232
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,672
Just picture it "Tabitha Cook,
the voice of America's future".

233
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,308
"This is Tabitha Cook".

234
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,618
Then is our illustrious President Trey.

235
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,709
This is how he looks awake.

236
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,511
To see him like this, you need
to get him before second period.

237
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:47,551
Trey, got an idea.

238
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:50,753
Sign this absentee ballot and you won't
have to come to today's meeting.

239
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:54,293
And I hear the surf's 10 feet
and off shore and cresting.

240
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:55,818
Dude, that's awesome.

241
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:58,672
I mean, it's too many damn meetings.

242
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:01,213
I only ran because my
friend Luke goes "Dude

243
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:04,015
if you run for President,
I'll lick your dogs butt.":

244
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,809
I go: "Dude, it's on"

245
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,843
[mumbles]

246
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:13,584
And let us not forget

247
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,674
Our school spirit fundamentalist.

248
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:22,561
Meat is so much more expensive than
even locally grown vegetables,

249
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,212
that the savings would
be enough for us to

250
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,122
buy our very own helium tank.

251
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,321
So then, I tell her about the
helium tanks, and she says...

252
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:36,850
"Thank God, my cheeks
are killing me."

253
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,539
Sounds like my Roast Beef
sandwich days are numbered.

254
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,893
You can kiss your meat goodbye.

255
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:43,596
I still got Tuesday through Thursday.

256
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,083
Oh, so we're not having
"Meatless Friday's" too huh?

257
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:49,675
So I printed this up, it's a

258
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,644
new theory on the real reason
why Oceanic flight 815 crashed.

259
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,089
My God, time traveling
fantasy TV is so confusing.

260
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,877
Oh, hey Cameron, we were just
talking about you. Sit, Sit.

261
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:01,514
Hello Ladies.

262
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,167
Gotta a little gift for you.

263
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,807
-Oh
-Yeah

264
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:12,075
It's your favorite!
Brigadier General, Billy Mitchel.

265
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:15,376
Right! From that...
war.

266
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,553
World War I, Stacy.

267
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:20,493
She's a little nervous.

268
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:24,323
Thank you so much, Cameron.
I'll put them by my bed.

269
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:27,736
Well, no it should really be in a
climate controlled environment.

270
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:30,953
You'll keep him in your special
refrigeration case Stace.

271
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:32,770
- Oh Ok
- Perfect.

272
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:35,585
Ok, I got a little surprise.

273
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:38,311
My mom, made and extra

274
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:41,491
peanut and bacon sandwich for you.

275
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,530
She cut the crust off and
put it on olive bread

276
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,873
just like we like it.

277
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:48,643
That...
looks really good.

278
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:54,186
Oh, it's so good, right?

279
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:57,403
I bet it tastes better than
one of those expired Dharma

280
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,557
candy bars Hurley found
in the Hatch huh?

281
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,464
Yeah, like from "Lost", right?

282
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,686
Uh, I can't.
I can't.

283
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:07,659
Bianca, I really appreciate
the make over but...

284
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,133
remember everything you told me to say

285
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:13,384
and I hate bacon and
Kevin deserves a girl

286
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:16,500
who will treasure this Billy D.
Williams action figure.

287
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,001
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,881
She just called this an Action Figure.

289
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,607
What is going on?

290
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:33,455
Did you put her up to this?

291
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,373
I just wanted you to be happy..

292
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:39,530
Well, mission accomplished!
I'm s...so happy.

293
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,996
Cameron, she really was
interested in you.

294
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,362
Come on, come on.
Please go my way.

295
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:53,548
Hey.
Want to get out of here?

296
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,100
No now.
Student Council is

297
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,852
voting on "Meatless Mondays"

298
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:58,955
-Again?
-No it was tabled remembered?

299
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,923
What?
It was defeated? x

300
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,130
It passed by 3 votes.

301
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:07,161
"Your Mondays will
evermore be 'Meat free"

302
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:08,699
We did it!

303
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,293
Thank you so much!

304
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:12,313
I only did it so you'd
stop hounding me.

305
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:16,583
I should head back inside.

306
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,540
Before Tabitha has be
drawn and quartered.

307
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:23,037
Oh, yes!
Can you believe this?

308
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,711
Nice, we go now?

309
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:27,284
That's it? I finally change something
around here for the better,

310
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,332
and all you say is "That's nice"?

311
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,610
Well done mate!
Cheerio!

312
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,041
Look who's a douche now!

313
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,239
Oh, no.

314
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,920
I know, I know.

315
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,025
Insert "Dead Raccoon" joke here.

316
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,510
Dad, what were you thinking?

317
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:03,513
I uploaded that picture of me with hair

318
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:05,545
and then things just snow
balled out of control.

319
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,541
And the snow ball killed a
raccoon and landed on head?

320
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,111
At least it gave it's
life for a good cause.

321
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,587
I guess the lesson here is...

322
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:16,102
honesty is the best policy.

323
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,479
Think I would have learned that by now.

324
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,099
Well my date

325
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,985
wasn't completely honest
on her profile either.

326
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:26,191
I think she went to high
school with your Grandfather.

327
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,240
So, it was a disaster?

328
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,286
You know, it was strange

329
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:33,212
while I was waiting for
her to walk in the door

330
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:35,082
I felt excited.

331
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,853
Your mother was the love of my life

332
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,037
and after she died I never thought

333
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,312
I never thought I'd want to
meet someone again. But just

334
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:45,586
that little spark

335
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,201
of anticipation made me realize.

336
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,143
Life goes on!

337
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,812
Daddy, that's fantastic.

338
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:57,599
Now please take that thing
off your head an burn it.

339
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,059
I would but it's glued on.

340
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:08,290
Hey everybody!

341
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,305
Who wants a balloon filled
with this super cool helium?

342
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,222
Veggie lasagna and side salad.

343
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,400
Um..
Smells like victory.

344
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,456
Oh, I wouldn't know...

345
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,806
I lost my sense of smell in 'Nam.

346
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,925
Oh, I'm s...

347
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,783
Because here at Padua High

348
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:32,624
we know that we can't
enjoy our lunch today

349
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,728
unless we think about tomorrow

350
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,109
This is Tabitha Cook,

351
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,181
Voice of America's Future

352
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:40,380
signing off.

353
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:43,190
Ok, I need a copy of that ASAP

354
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,480
I'm sending it straight
to Gretta Vansestron

355
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,193
Cat, I so appreciate what you've done.

356
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:51,234
I've always wanted to
be socially conscious.

357
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,206
And you've made it
possible for me to do so.

358
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,892
Within my existing schedule.

359
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,264
Hey! Saving the planet
shouldn't be a chore.

360
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,813
Well, I think it's awful
what Blank has done.

361
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,114
Blank?
What do you mean?

362
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:10,709
Ladies and Gentlemen...
I am a big fan of tradition

363
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,484
I believe a man should
open a door for a lady.

364
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:15,286
I believe nothing says class

365
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,989
like a white Oxford shirt.

366
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,590
And I believe that everyone has a right

367
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,192
to a slice a pepperoni pizza

368
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:22,104
to get them through a tough Monday.

369
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:26,240
Bad people have taken
your pepperoni away.

370
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,178
They are force feeding you
their Hippy agenda instead.

371
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,731
But I promise you this, I
will fight for your meat!

372
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:37,901
In fact, I'm making it the
corner stone of my campaign

373
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:40,516
for Padua High student
council President.

374
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,864
<i>-Pizza!
</i> -Blank!

375
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:48,367
Cat, do you want a slice of pizza?
I ordered on plain cheese.

376
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,534
I'm pretending this is your face.

377
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:55,687
Cat, I told you from the start that
I didn't believe in your crusade.

378
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:58,492
So you helped me get it passed,
just so you can tear it down?

379
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,051
You are such a douche.

380
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:02,573
Well, there's no reason for
vulgarities, you got your veggies

381
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,996
and I got divisive wedge
issue to put me on the map.

382
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,323
It's a win, win!
Yea, us!

383
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,172
Don't try to spin this.

384
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,334
You betrayed me.

385
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,604
It's not personal, it's just politics

386
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,142
Cameron, here me out.

387
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:26,544
I know you are mad, but I have
3 questions to ask you and

388
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:29,107
if you never want to speak to me, fine.

389
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,732
Did you like Stacy?

390
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,267
- Yes
- Were you excited about Stacy?

391
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,315
- Yes - So it's theoretically
possible that you

392
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:37,637
could be interested in
someone besides me?

393
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,139
Yes, if she wasn't just
a theoretical person.

394
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,814
I know, I did the wrong thing...
But I did it for the right reasons.

395
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,824
I thought if you got excited about someone
else, then you'd be happy and we could go back

396
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,906
to being friends, and it worked!

397
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:50,716
Yeah, right up until my
complete and utter humiliation..

398
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,209
But, You felt something for Stacy.

399
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,410
What means you getting over me...
You know, it could have be worse.

400
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,874
She can walk off with your
Brigadier General Billy Mitchell.

401
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,953
I can't believe you really
did all the research.

402
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,895
You knows even what more unbelievable?

403
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,011
I'm know addicted to that stupid
antique soldier site on Ebay.

404
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:15,051
You know. people are going to nuts on
this German General Eric Ludendorf.

405
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,769
No way!
There is a Luddy up for sale?

406
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,269
- Yea. it's expires in two hours.
- I'm better going on that

407
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,460
I need him to completely my depiction
of the 'Spring Offensive of 1918'.

408
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,789
- I'm missed you, Cameron.
- Me too. [Music Playing]

409
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,085
Only if you promise no
to say, "I told you so".

410
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:44,023
You were right about Blank, He such a do...
Do-haed.

411
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:47,650
- I gotta to stop to using that word...
- So, Blank's a douche.

412
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,185
- I told you so. - I can't believe
I let him use me like that...

413
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:52,362
Well, you changed things..

414
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,625
Because of you, I'm
eating my first soy dog.

415
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,352
What do you think?

416
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:03,180
It's not bad.
But if guys hate meat so much...

417
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,960
Then why it's taste like a meat?

418
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,939
- Ahh.
- No, I'm serious

419
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,330
- What's up with that?
- Well, it's not that I hate the taste...

420
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:15,519
It's just that... what ever I'm seeing meat,
all I see it's little face, saying...

421
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,615
"Don't eat me".

422
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,380
UN huh, And how long you
been in these hallucinations?

423
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,462
For years. But this is
definitely my best one. You...

424
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,911
eating a soy dog.
- Hmm...

425
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:31,781
I'm not going to grow... man boobs like
the guy from Entourage right? Right?

426
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,038
Alright, I forgot to
tell you that part.

427
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,112
Don't worry, You look
great in a 'B' cup.

428
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:39,139
- Thank you...
- You're welcome.
