00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,205
Hey, hey, Kat,

160
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,440
have you seen
Patrick Verona?

161
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,075
No, why? Is that his package?
No.

162
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,977
I saw his name on it.
Why do you have it?

163
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,545
No reason.

164
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,180
He's getting his mail
sent to my house.

165
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:15,382
It's supposed to be
on the DL,

166
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,151
so please don't
tell him I told you,
or I'll have to home school,

167
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:19,752
and my mom's a drop-out.

168
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,855
Why would he do this?
Do you know what's in here?

169
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,491
No, but it isn't ticking
and nothing's seeping out,

170
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,626
so it's not a bomb
or a severed head.

171
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,827
Something weird's going on.

172
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:31,162
I'm worried
Patrick's in real trouble.

173
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,596
I wish we could
just open this.

174
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,999
No. You can't do that.

175
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,000
Mail tampering's a felony.

176
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,168
Yeah, you're right.

177
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:40,170
A felony probably would
look bad on a college app,

178
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:42,271
but we could follow him.

179
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:43,939
Follow Patrick Verona?

180
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:46,842
No way, no how, no, ma'am.

181
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,844
You've got a death wish.
Be my guest.

182
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,846
Count me out, misses.

183
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,181
Okay. Then I guess I'll just
have to ask Patrick myself

184
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,016
what's in the package
that was sent to you

185
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,651
that nobody's
supposed to know about.

186
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:00,987
So follow him?

187

[cheerleaders]
Joey, Joey, he's our man.

188

If he can't pose it,
no one can.

189

I'm Joey Donner, quarterback
of the Padua High Penguins,

and I'm the next
Biggest Poser.

191
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,772
Oh, no. Not the next biggest,
the Biggest Poser.

192
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,511
Cut.

193

We've got to do it again.
My abs still aren't popping.

194
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:32,815
Joey, we've already
done it 17 times.

195
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,317
Your abs look amazing.

196
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:36,152
But they have to be
astounding,

197
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:38,820
or Pixie Krotch
will rip me to shreds.

all the signs.

201
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,194
No, that's what I was
afraid of.

202
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,063
Wait, Joey's a guy.
Guys don't get
eating disorders.

called "I'm a dude, and I
have an eating disorder."

205
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,334
Ooh, that sounds good.

206
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:58,802
Joey needs our help.

207
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,438
What do we do? How do you even
bring something like this up?

208
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:02,939
Well, it's tricky.

209
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:06,142
The article said
he'll be full of shame.

210

Have you guys ever seen
Intervention?

211

Here, take my car.

Really? What's the catch?

213
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:23,452
No catch. You're just
a friend in need.

214
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,786
Just like that?

215
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,955
Just bring it back
in one piece.
Okay.

216
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:28,122
You need a ride home?

217
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,691
No, I'm good. Drive safe.

218
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,359
Okay, thanks.

219

You're weird when you're nice.

00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,570
Kat, Kat.

221
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,274
This is your mom's car?

222
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:55,109
Might as well follow him
in a parade float.

223
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:57,879
Well, I doubt he's expecting

224
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,047
southern California's
third highest-earning

225
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,549
Josie May saleswoman
to be hot on his tail.

226
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,384
Here's your disguise.

227
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,885
Here.

228
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,322
Just go.
We're going to lose him.

229
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,724
I just got my license
last week.

230
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,225
I feel like I should warn you.

231
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,728
Prepare, observe, move.

232
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:15,762
Go!

233
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:19,399
I'm just worried
that if we have

234
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,134
an intervention for Joey,
he'll freak.

235
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,269
Plus, how am I
supposed to explain

236
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,970
why you guys are there
and not his football buddies?

237
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,705
So invite
his football buddies.

238
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,074
I can't. Then he'll be
really embarrassed.

239
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,009
He'd never forgive me.

240
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,810
Okay, pause for genius.

241
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:37,214
We'll do a fake intervention
for Bianca,

242
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,549
then it'll make sense
that it's only us and Joey.

243
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,750
Then we'll use
all of his real problems

244
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,418
as your fake problems.

245
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,686
Once he hears that you guys

246
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:46,521
do all the same
sick, bizarre stuff--

247
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,421
He'll totally realize
he has a problem, too.

248
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:51,458
Oh, my God. C, it's brills.
I love this idea.

249
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:54,427
I don't know. It seems
a little far-fetched.

250
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,629
Why would he believe it?
Trust me.

251
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,431
<i>I've seen all 108
episodes of Intervention.</i>

252
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,433
I can coach you
how to react.

253
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,701
First, you need to be
in denial.

254
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:03,236
It's the most pathetic step.

255
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,938
Then, you have to
angrily get up

256
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,039
and try to leave.

257
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,740
The more erratic you act,
the better.

258
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:10,376
Once you sit back down,
we all read our letters to you.

259
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,378
We tell you how much
we love you, blah blah,

260
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,347
and how much your sickness
is hurting all of us,
blah blah.

261
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,381
Then finally,
you break down, cry,

262
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,616
and admit that you have
a problem.

263
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,885
Okay. It's worth a try.

264
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,219
Yay.

265
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,754
I haven't had this much fun
planning something

266

last year.

268

going to this corporate
office building.

271
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,565
Because he'll recognize me.

You're not 6'6".

273
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,501
Just park.

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,271
Oh, gosh.

275

writing checks,

00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,056
I had no idea you had
a problem, Bianca.

317
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,658
You eat all the time.

318
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:33,160
I just thought
you were one of those
naturally skinny girls

319
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,495
who'd eventually fill out
as she matured.

320
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,130
Not that you're not
as beautiful as anything

321
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,032
just the way you are.

322
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:43,069
I'm just saying it's why
this is such a shock.

323
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,571
Oh, good, Ms. Tharp.

324
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,105
I figured I'd clue in
a professional,

325
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,239
so I called
the guidance counselor.

326
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:49,974
I'm here, Bianca.

327
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,010
Let me join
this circle of love, okay?

328
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,717
It's been almost an hour.
What is he doing in there?

329
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:03,319
Oh, I got to pee,
I got to pee, I got to pee.

330
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,654
I told you not to drink
that huge soda.

331
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,989
Well, that ship has sailed.

332
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,691
Let me just run in real quick.

333
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,659
No. What if he comes out?

334
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,861
Here. If you have to
pee so bad, use this.

335
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:17,464
Are you kidding?
I just started using public
restrooms a year ago.

336
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:28,339
Hi. I need
a hydrating concealer
in light beige,

337
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:32,943
unless you think I need
a medium beige.

338
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:35,011
Just give us a minute,
ma'am.

339
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:37,580
Look, my mom
loaned me the car.

340
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:40,015
The least we can do
is make a sale.

341
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,784
Everything's
in the back seat.

342
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,018
Where are you going?

343
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:44,186
Into the bushes.

344
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,855
I appreciate
the soda cup offer,

345
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,623
but I want my first time
exposing myself

346
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,057
to be with someone special.

347
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,832
So light or medium?
Do you have your color wheel?

348
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,067
No, but I'm thinking
light beige.

349
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:06,069
Unless I find medium first.

350
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:08,637
Oh, my goodness.

351
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:14,176
Your giant sales associate
is urinating in the bushes.

352
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,411
This is not your toilet,
young man!

353
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,647
He's not peeing.
He's collecting samples

354
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,916
for our organic line.

355
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,918
Here you go.
Free gift, new customer.

356
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,286
Oh, thank you.
Awesome.

357
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:26,322
Do you have a card?
Bye-bye now.

358
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,356
Bye-bye.

359
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:32,594
What?

360
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,164
You followed me?

361
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:37,165
No.

362
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,806
This is just my new
after-school job.

363
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,496
So you're stalking me now?

364
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:47,231
Look,
we're not stalking you.

365
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:48,966
Cameron and I just have
a lot of questions.

366
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,267
No, I don't have
any questions,
not a one.

367
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:54,103
In fact, I have answers--
to homework questions.

368
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,638
I'm going to go
sit in the car.

369
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,674
Where are you going?

370
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,341
See, this is why
I had to follow you,

371
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,311
because any time anybody
wants to talk to you,
you just walk off.

372
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:04,779
I was at
my therapist's office.

373
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,247
He's really good.
You want his card?

374
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,748
Therapist? I thought--

375
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:08,949
You thought what?

376
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,450
I was going to
my secret crack den

377
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:12,284
so me and my baby mama
could tat each other up?

378
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,786
No.

379
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,787
I don't know. Why are you
seeing a therapist?

380
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,389
Let's just say
I'm not really having
a Josie May day.

381
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,528
Patrick.

382
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:30,166
Kat, I'm going to take off.
Can I get that visor back?

383
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:39,506
Bianca, sweetie,
how long have you been
struggling with this problem?

384
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,408
I don't know.
Not that long.

385
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,442
It's okay.

386
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:45,643
You're in a safe zone.

387
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:48,812
Thanks, but I'm
kind of ashamed.

388
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,747
I'd rather it just
be my friends.

389
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,648
Why don't you think of me
as a friend

390
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:55,550
who happens to have
a Master's in counseling?

391
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,318
Now,
I've got a secret for you.

392
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:58,986
Believe it or not,

393
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:00,187
I have also had my battles

394
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:02,355
with self-esteem
and body issues,

395
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,891
so I totally get
where you're coming from.

396
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,092
Now, I would like
to introduce you
to mirror work,

397
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,394
which changed my life.

398
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,096
So why don't you take a look
and tell me what you see?

399
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,499
Can you see
how pretty you are?

400
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,639
Yeah, I am really pretty.

401
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:19,907
You can go now.

402
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,776
Don't be mad at me
for asking her to come,
Fiver.

403
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,710
I'd do anything
to help you get better.

404
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,513
Really?

405
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,450
Well, you know what would
really help?

406
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:32,220
It would be great if you
could be healthy with me.

407
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:35,225
Oh, good idea.
Mm-hm.
Yes.

408
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,826
I'll give up my food log

409
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,294
if you give up yours,

410
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:40,796
and I'll stop doing
obsessive crunches
if you will.

411
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,197
Would you do that for me?

412
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,900
For you? Sure.

413
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:48,702
Bianca.

414
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:50,971
Dad.
Oh, Dr. Stratford,
thank you for coming.

415
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,672
I came soon as I could.
Honey, if you have a problem,
we'll deal with it.

416
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:56,241
We'll get you counseling.
Or Ms. Tharp says

417
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,176
there's an excellent
boarding school in Utah

418
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,878
that's had amazing
success stories.

419
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,746
Utah? No, I don't have
an eating disorder.

420
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,514
This is what denial
looks like.

421
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,282
I really don't. Joey does.

422
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,384
This is a fake
intervention for him.

423
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:10,018
We were afraid
he'd be full of shame,

424
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,419
so we pretended
it was for me.

425
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,094
Wait, Joey, I'm sorry,
but I didn't know
what else to do

426
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:23,495
when you lied about
eating those cupcakes.

427
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,031
I didn't lie.
Check my food log.

428
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,066
If I'd eaten them,
I would have made
a notation

429
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,867
in the bad carbs column.

430
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:32,836
See?

431
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,404
I'm eating
2,500 calories a day--

432
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,839
lean protein,
whole grains, veggies,

433
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:41,108
and odorless
fish oil caps.

434
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:43,110
My body fat's at 12%.

435
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:44,778
That's as healthy
as you can get.

436
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,447
But what about the chicken?
I saw you spit it out.

437
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:49,115
And you were obsessing
over your abs,

438
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,783
even though they're better
than the Situation's.

439
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,784
The chicken was raw.

440
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,453
And I know my abs
are way better than
the Situation's.

441
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,654
That's why I'm always
doing this.

442
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:02,059
I admit, I got a little crazy
with the video,

443
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:04,395
but that's only because
I really want to get
on the show

444
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,730
to launch my super-successful
modeling career.

445
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm just impatient
to take the world by storm.
That's all.

446
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,735
I just want you
to be careful.

447
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:17,071
So many models get too thin
because of all the pressures
to be modely,

448
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,173
and I don't want that
to happen to you.

449
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:21,074
I don't want that
to happen, either.

450
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,742
So tell you what.

451
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:27,078
If you see me going overboard,
you pull me back to shore.

452
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:28,313
Deal?

453
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,549
Deal.

454
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,322
So then who ate
those frigging cupcakes?

455
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,429
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have followed you.

456
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:47,597
At least let me give you
a ride home.

457
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:49,832
We don't even have to talk.

458
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:05,612
Just drop me back at school.

459
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,282
I can take you
all the way home.
It's no problem.

460
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,085
Okay, school it is.

461
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,523
So how about them Dodgers?

462
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:20,125
I'm a Padres fan.

463
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,461
See, that's something
I didn't know about you.

464
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,829
Sharing's fun.

465
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:26,997
Why do you care so much?

466
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,166
Because.

467
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,834
Because what?

468
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:35,805
I just care about you, okay?

469
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,773
God, I'm sorry. I'll stop.

470
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:40,576
What do you want to know?

471
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,478
Why are you in therapy?

472
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:44,645
You were right.

473
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,947
The sleep eating
is from stress,

474
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:48,682
caused by my stepfather.

475
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:50,951
He's a jackass.

476
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,153
Thank you for telling me.

477
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,656
So what's in the package?

478
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,258
A Snuggie.

479
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,561
Who wouldn't want
a blanket with arms?
