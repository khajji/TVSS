1
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:05,831
* I need a guy *

2
00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:10,464
* That I can call my baby *

3
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:14,157
* The kind of guy *

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,779
* That treats me like a lady... *

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,948
Ah! Sweet mother.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,412
What the hell are you doing here.
It is 11:00 at night.

7
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:29,584
Isn't it obvious? I'm a vampire,
I need permission to enter.

8
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:31,684
Permission not granted.

9
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,956
Good thing I'm not
really a vampire.

10
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:39,440
Vinyls.
How old school.

11
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:40,959
I keep it real.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,050
- I've never seen this Beatles album.
- It was only released in the U.K.

13
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,180
Those were my mom's.
She was a real purist.

14
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:47,714
She sounds cool.

15
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,316
She was.

16
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:53,123
So again, what is with
the breaking and entering?

17
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:57,688
I had something
I wanted to tell you.

18
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,312
Can I borrow Bioré--
A male in your bedroom?

19
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:03,707
And he's cute.

20
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,156
- Am I sleepwalking again?
- Shh!

21
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,803
Dad is going to hear you.

22
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,049
Girls!

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,639
Oh, my God. Crap, crap, crap.
Get out. Get out of here.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,207
Get out, get out, get out.

25
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,543
Just a second, Dad.
I'm indecent.

26
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:18,157
And in so much trouble.
I'm loving this.

27
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:19,612
I'm coming in!

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,997
Spooky.

29
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,931
There's a brush fire.
The whole neighborhood's evacuating.

30
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:29,005
- We have to get out of this house right now.
- Just give me two minutes to get changed.

31
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,439
- We don't have time.
- Aw.

32
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:38,291
We had time.

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,820
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

34
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,107
Excuse me. Stand back.

35
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:56,116
Baby on board.

36
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:59,620
Can you girls handle check-in?
I'm going to volunteer at first aid.

37
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,982
Who knows? Maybe I'll get
to deliver a fire baby.

38
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,236
I feel like a poodle
at a dessert buffet.

39
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:08,999
What I wouldn't do
for a flat iron right now.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,899
People could be losing their homes,
and you're worried about your hair.

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,702
Ugh. You're worse
than Anderson Cooper.

42
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:15,841
Ooh.

43
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:19,621
You're looking for Patrick.
You like him.

44
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,744
- No, I don't.
- You want to kiss him.

45
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:24,295
Really? Are you five?

46
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:27,571
I'm just excited to know
that you're capable of physical attraction.

47
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:31,938
Now maybe I won't have to suffer the burden
of caring for you and your cats when you're old.

48
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,640
Sorry. Can't take you seriously
with your hair like this.

49
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,759
Bianca.

50
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:41,025
Face forward and don't say anything, or
I'll tell Patrick you want to have his babies.

51
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:45,428
Bianca, can you believe this?
Fires are so scary. I'm totally traumatized.

52
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,168
And what you're wearing
doesn't help.

53
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,604
I sleep in the nude,
so I had to borrow these.

54
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,453
Wow.
These are desperate times.

55
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,630
You wouldn't happen to have
anything less flannel I could borrow?

56
00:02:56,631 --> 00:03:01,249
Sorry. Someone once returned something
with a snag so I don't do that anymore.

57
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,480
But if you find something,
we'll be in room 103.

58
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:06,053
It's where all the cheerleaders
are sleeping.

59
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,078
Sure.

60
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,124
Oh, oh, oh. And could you
get me some more blankets?

61
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,895
My resting body temp is 98.1,
which means I'm freezing...

62
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:17,032
and Frau Stick in the mud up there
would only give me two.

63
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,441
It is so sad when people
abuse their power.

64
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:25,571
I keep forgetting
you're related to that.

65
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:31,581
I can't believe her broomstick
didn't burn in the fire.

66
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:36,736
Hi, I can take it from here.
I am an OBGYN.

67
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:39,607
Oh, thank God. The only thing
I know about delivering babies...

68
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,808
- I learned from "Gone with the Wind".
- Do you have a certificate or something?

69
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,019
Just want to make sure
you're not one of those kooks...

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,669
that goes around saying they're
a gynecologist so they can look at my...

71
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,749
lady business.

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,074
But that's one of the perks
of the job, ma'am.

73
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:53,089
Just kidding.
Give me your hand and relax.

74
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,541
What are you, about seven months in?
Guess what. Everyone's fine.

75
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,710
This bun's not coming out
of the oven tonight.

76
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:01,315
- Lie back and relax, okay?
- Okay.

77
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,010
But I'm keeping my knees closed.

78
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,378
You should have thought
of that seven months ago.

79
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:10,894
- I'll be here. You don't have to stay.
- Oh, that's okay. I don't mind.

80
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:13,767
I mean, what else am I going to do?
Rank the stuff I'll miss the most...

81
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,707
if my house burns down?

82
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,605
I think I'd miss
my house the most.

83
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:18,981
Oh, not me.

84
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:21,562
It reminds me of my ex-husband
and his love of linoleum.

85
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:23,285
It's everywhere.

86
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,976
Oh, my memory foam pillow.
That's what I'll miss the most.

87
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:32,998
I spent a lot of lonely nights trying to get
the depressions just right, you know?

88
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,325
Dude, there are vulnerable
hot chicks all over this place...

89
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,259
looking for a shoulder to cry on.

90
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,556
I know it's wrong,
but I love this fire.

91
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:51,892
Yeah, me, too. Now I know
what Bianca wears to bed.

92
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,056
<i>In a new development,
authorities believe...</i>

93
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:57,565
<i>the canyon brushfire may have been
started by homemade pyrotechnics.</i>

94
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,567
Homemade pyrotechnics?

95
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,336
Yeah, like fireworks,
flares--

96
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,138
Or model rockets.

97
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,119
Michael, that model rocket
we launched yesterday in my backyard--

98
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,255
it never came down.

99
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,070
You think we started the fire?

100
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,575
No, there's no way.
All we did was push a button.

101
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:19,996
That shot a vessel of highly flammable
balsa wood containing gunpowder--

102
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:25,893
into bone-dry brush,
igniting a gigantic conflagration.

103
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,039
Uh-oh.

104
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:31,336
Girls, I'm here for you
in your time of need, okay?

105
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:35,569
So why don't we go around the circle and
share what we're scared of losing the most?

106
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,548
My vintage collection of Us Weeklies.
They're irreplaceable.

107
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,508
My ionic featherweight hair dryer.

108
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,425
- It blows so hard.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:50,510
If my house burns down, I'll lose
every single photo of my mother.

110
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,070
Oh, you poor thing.

111
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:55,777
I'm sure your house will be fine.

112
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,655
Aw, so sad.
I know exactly how you feel.

113
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,995
My mother is in Brazil,
getting her second face lift.

114
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:06,851
What if she doesn't wake up
from the anesthesia?

115
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:11,761
If I could talk to her right now, I would say,
"Mom, you're perfect just the way you are."

116
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,407
God, I remember this one time
when my mom went out of town--

117
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:17,520
Dawn, you had your turn, okay?
Wow.

118
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,904
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

119
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:22,064
I should really be
with my parents right now.

120
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:24,810
They're probably
worried sick about me.

121
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,353
Yeah, me, too.

122
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:29,122
My dad gets so needy
in a crisis. Sorry.

123
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:33,550
But you guys, wait. We haven't
finished our little share circle.

124
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,645
I'm here to listen
as long as you want to talk.

125
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,221
Thanks, B.

126
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:42,924
Maybe Michelle should be
in that mascot suit instead of you.

127
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:45,368
Keep talking.
I'm still listening.

128
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,420
You know what we need?
Hot chocolate.

129
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:52,363
Yeah. No sugar, no whipped cream.
Wait, whipped cream...

130
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,324
but only if it's
the fake kind, okay?

131
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh, and you can have yours
however you like it. Go. Thank you.

132
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,841
Bye-bye.
Scoot, scoot.

133
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,492
There you go, ma'am.

134
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:08,315
Does this have seeds in it?
I have diverticulitis.

135
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,468
I'm not sure, actually.

136
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:17,581
Oh, who's that you're undressing
with your eyes?

137
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,581
Your boyfriend?

138
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,266
No. Just this guy I know.

139
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,778
Oh, missy,
I wasn't born yesterday.

140
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,327
I can see that.

141
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:32,405
So, you made it.
Where's your family?

142
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:35,015
I killed them all.
They were slowing me down.

143
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:37,772
Natural disasters
do bring out the best in people.

144
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,955
So, what was your big epiphany?

145
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,249
You're okay.
Did you get my messages?

146
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,544
I sent you, like,
a million texts.

147
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:47,955
When are we going to talk? You said
you needed to tell me something.

148
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:50,058
It's not like that.

149
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,873
Sure it's not.
Enjoy your chat.

150
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,760
Are you mad at me?

151
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:06,481
Oh!

152
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,238
Have you ever done
something you've regretted?

153
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,407
Giving you advice,
because you keep coming back.

154
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:16,427
Okay, but have you ever done something
you're really sorry about?

155
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,455
What did you do?

156
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:21,437
I think I started the fire.

157
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,581
Let me guess.
You set off a model rocket.

158
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:25,829
How'd you know?

159
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,341
It was either that
or you're setting your farts on fire.

160
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,091
So what's the problem?

161
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:35,261
The problem is the guilt is eating me alive.
I'm thinking of confessing.

162
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,136
Well, it's not like
you did it on purpose.

163
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,651
You're right. That's it.
I'll tell them what happened...

164
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,743
that it was an accident,
and I'm really sorry.

165
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:46,608
Yeah. Worst case scenario,
you get five, ten years.

166
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,209
You can handle prison.

167
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,080
And with a face like yours,
you'll have a husband in no time.

168
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,013
Oh, goodie.
You're back.

169
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:09,531
Um, what are non-cheerleaders
doing here?

170
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,363
- A volunteer brought them in.
- Okay.

171
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:16,771
- Then you can volunteer to take them out.
- But they brought homemade baklava.

172
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,541
With real honey. It's super delicious.
You'll love it.

173
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,005
And this is Sarab.

174
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:25,298
He's only 11, and he speaks 3 languages,
including Russian.

175
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,936
Pleasure it is to meet you.

176
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:30,593
Oh, how cute.
You talk like Yoda.

177
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,942
So cute. Cuteness.

178
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:37,737
Yeah, we're going to need to get them
out of here, and by we, I mean you.

179
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:40,562
But there's plenty of room here.

180
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,056
Bianca, Bianca.

181
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:45,566
I thought this was supposed
to be bonding time for us...

182
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,679
to really cement our friendship.

183
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,150
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Yeah, of course.

184
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:52,284
Then get them moved
to another classroom.

185
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,439
And when you get back,
I'll flat iron your hair.

186
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:56,555
Oof.

187
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,457
Can't wait.

188
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:11,040
Go after him already.
Seize the moment.

189
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:13,689
Life is short.
Trust me, I know.

190
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,651
You're old.
I get it.

191
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,302
Do you have keys to any of the classrooms?
I need you to open one.

192
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,877
Chastity needs more room
for her ego?

193
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:27,917
Someone brought a family
into our room and she's a bit territorial.

194
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,646
Too bad. Tell Genghis Chastity
that there's a fire going on...

195
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,731
- and we all need to pull together.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,484
We are the world.
I get it.

197
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,765
- Can't you just open a door, please?
- Not a chance.

198
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,354
Why can't you just help me once?

199
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,669
Why does everything you do
have to be about principles?

200
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,339
Why does everything you do
have to be about Chastity?

201
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,921
- It's pathetic.
- Fine.

202
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:49,631
I guess you'd rather be handing
out water bottles to old ladies...

203
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:52,634
rather than making out with
Patrick Verona, but you're right.

204
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,777
I'm the one who's pathetic.

205
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:13,702
Now that her contractions have stopped,
do you want to share this bottle of wine...

206
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,457
I can't pronounce?

207
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,611
Well, with a wine this nice,
it's a miracle you remembered your kids.

208
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:22,731
Yeah, my ex and I were saving it
for our 30th anniversary.

209
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:26,306
Now, instead of toasting that tragedy,
we can toast this one.

210
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,545
- May I?
- Please.

211
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,424
What's your deal, anyway? You married?
Separated? Big fat cheater?

212
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:37,914
Widowed.

213
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:39,629
I'm so sorry.

214
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,873
- Was it recent?
- Yes. Seven years.

215
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:44,384
Oh.

216
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:48,590
Well, different people
move on at different speeds.

217
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:52,293
So... that's totally normal.
Ish.

218
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,331
You seem to bounced back
pretty well.

219
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,010
- Mind sharing your secret?
- Therapy.

220
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,574
Thousands and thousands
of dollars of therapy.

221
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,701
Actually, I'm just now getting back
to the dating scene myself.

222
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:09,071
- Ah. How's that going?
- Online dating is brutal...

223
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:13,673
but I'm getting the hang of it.
Now I'm an entertainer in my early 30s.

224
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,696
I should help you with your profile.
And I've got Photoshop.

225
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,165
- Should I be thankful or offended?
- Grateful.

226
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:34,964
Chastity, I'm sorry.
We can't relocate the family.

227
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:40,568
But we can view this as an opportunity
to learn about another culture.

228
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:43,512
- It'll be fun.
- It would be fun.

229
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:47,332
But it would also be
horribly selfish of us.

230
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:50,182
Think about what they must be
going through, Bianca.

231
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:54,822
They probably lived in very small huts
in whatever country they came from.

232
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:58,949
This room must seem
overwhelmingly large for them.

233
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:02,216
We should totally put them
in the janitor's closet.

234
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:04,021
They'd be more comfortable there.

235
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,698
- But--
- Ooh, but, but.

236
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,402
Doot doot. But nothing.

237
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:10,605
Unless you want to learn
carpet weaving from your new friends.

238
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:14,276
I know. You could weave
yourself a new mascot suit.

239
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,385
That's really not very nice.

240
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,854
We actually do weave
beautiful carpets.

241
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:19,986
See?

242
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,450
Chastity, I'm not putting
a family of six in a closet.

243
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:25,092
Oh, wow.

244
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:28,590
Okay, I'm going to pretend this little
temper tantrum never happened.

245
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:32,691
I know you're really stressed
about losing all your dead mom stuff.

246
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:36,547
Yoda, tell your clan
to start packing.

247
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,970
You are such a bitch!

248
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,631
- What did you say to me?
- You heard me.

249
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:53,432
You are a manipulative, conniving,
mean little shrew of a person...

250
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:59,071
and I am sick of taking your crap.
Can't you see that nobody likes you?

251
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:10,833
That was harsh.

252
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:24,363
Don't jump.

253
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:27,810
Aw, I don't have to.
You're here now.

254
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:29,378
Okay, jump.

255
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm only three stories up.
All I'd do is break a leg.

256
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,097
It'd still be worth it.

257
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,933
Come check this out.
It's really beautiful.

258
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:43,015
If you don't think about
all the homes being destroyed.

259
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:46,131
Look over there.

260
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:47,574
Oh!

261
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,529
- Ah.
- Oh!

262
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:53,183
See?
You don't want me to jump.

263
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,024
You're such a jerk.

264
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,145
Now I can tell you
what I wanted to tell you.

265
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,720
Ooh, I'm on pins and needles.
Let me guess.

266
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,617
Is it the same thing you wanted
to tell the girl downstairs?

267
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,586
Oh, I like it
when you're jealous.

268
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,590
I'm not jealous. I'm appalled.
There's a difference.

269
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:11,263
Look, I was going to tell her
she should stop stalking me.

270
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,950
Big words from the guy
who shows up unannounced...

271
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:16,231
in my bedroom window
at 11:00 at night.

272
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,424
- That's way past visiting hours.
- You talk a lot.

273
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,189
Is that what
you wanted to tell me?

274
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,424
Sure.

275
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:49,341
- No, seriously.
- Oh, seriously.

276
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:51,401
Okay.

277
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,791
I realized why
I find you interesting.

278
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,180
Mm, do tell.

279
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,336
You're different from other girls.

280
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,097
You have a mind of your own.

281
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,147
That must be
a refreshing change for you.

282
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:09,639
It is. You're not
all clingy and needy.

283
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:14,480
We can just make out and it doesn't
have to be this whole big thing.

284
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,408
Right.

285
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,467
Right.

286
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:22,291
Because I'm a total slut.
But I have a mind of my own.

287
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,241
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Well, what did you mean?

288
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:28,709
I meant you're not living some fairy tale
where I'm your Prince Charming.

289
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,690
Trust me, no one would mistake you
for Prince Charming.

290
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,154
Prince Charles, maybe.

291
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:35,984
Ah, and we were having
such a nice time.

292
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:37,676
Unbelievable.

293
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:40,795
I'm worried about losing
my home, all of my stuff...

294
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,018
every memory,
and you just want to hook up.

295
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,353
Why do have to make
everything so difficult?

296
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,975
What can I say?
I'm not easy.

297
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,236
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you...

298
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:12,244
but I'm hot and tired and you
were acting like Janice Dickinson.

299
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:17,306
Well, excuse me for not wanting
to share my room with the entire USSR.

300
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,498
So what you said, was it true?

301
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,074
Yeah.

302
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,220
And here I thought we were
going to bond tonight, Bianca.

303
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:29,654
Bond? More like bondage
and I was your gimp.

304
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,366
Get me hot chocolate.
Fetch me blankets. Rub my feet.

305
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:36,187
You're using me,
just like you use all of us.

306
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,205
Wait.
Me, using you?

307
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:45,000
You want to be a cheerleader more than
Hillary Clinton wants to be president.

308
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,388
That's the only reason
you even speak to me.

309
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,708
Do you think it's easy being me?

310
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:53,432
I am the most popular girl
in school.

311
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:56,041
And some would argue
the prettiest, too.

312
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,013
I've got nowhere to go but down.

313
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:01,754
And I know that every girl in this
school would crush me in a second...

314
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,488
if she had the chance
to take my place.

315
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,362
I don't have any friends.

316
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:10,457
At least not any real ones.
I guess I'm all alone.

317
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,282
That's not true.

318
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,256
I'm here. And you're right,
I was using you.

319
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,882
And I'm sorry.

320
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:25,587
I accept your apology.

321
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,187
Um, is there anything
you want to say to me?

322
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:33,119
Mm, don't do it again?

323
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,497
How about "I'm sorry
for using you, too, Bianca"?

324
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,666
Okay.
What you said.

325
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,844
And, um...

326
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,057
I shouldn't have said
that about your mom.

327
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,334
Thanks.

328
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,037
You know, I kind of like you
when you're not ordering me around.

329
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,455
That's so sweet. And I like you,
when you're not being whiny and insecure.

330
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,369
Oh. No hugging.
And just an FYI.

331
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm not making you a cheerleader
just 'cause you're my best friend.

332
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:04,592
Uh, okay.

333
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:09,777
So you're saying for my profile I should
specifically avoid saying I'm a gynecologist?

334
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:11,883
Yes. Doctor is fine.

335
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,234
All right.
You're great at this.

336
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,327
Can I have your number?

337
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,774
I mean, I'd like more help
with my profile.

338
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,783
Can I be honest? First piece of advice,
you got to lose that ring.

339
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,349
Yeah, I know.

340
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,568
Would you believe that I've worn
it so long I think it's stuck?

341
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,858
Second piece of advice--
Butter.

342
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:40,763
I can't take it anymore. Slap the shackles
on me and take me upriver.

343
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,175
There's no punishment
greater than the knowledge...

344
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:46,675
that I caused people to lose
everything they care about.

345
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,161
Huh?

346
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:53,174
I started the fire.
It was a freak thing.

347
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,594
I miscalculated the trajectory
of the parabola.

348
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:59,720
Look, I don't know what your trip is, bro, but
they already caught the guys that started it.

349
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:02,782
Two college dudes
smoking some tasty cloves.

350
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,484
That's fantastic.

351
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:10,210
Oh, Bianca.
I'm so happy to see you.

352
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,478
I feel wonderful. Let's hang out
and talk all night long.

353
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,628
Okay, but we can't
do anything too physical.

354
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:19,256
If I snag these clothes,
I'm dead meat.

355
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,506
<i>Everyone, the fire
is officially contained.</i>

356
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:25,129
<i>You can all return
to your homes.</i>

357
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:30,439
Thank God. Now we don't have
to stay here and talk all night.

358
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,849
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
Bye, Cameron.

359
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:40,511
Look, I'm off-duty.
Fire's over.

360
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:43,878
So I guess I don't have to show you
what your boyfriend left for you.

361
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,544
He's not my boyfriend.

362
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,973
Over there.

363
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,347
Missy, lighten up.

364
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,120
I know a lot of cat ladies
who started out like you.

365
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,596
I'm so happy we can go home.

366
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,098
This evacuation has been
nothing but drama.

367
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,969
The fire is out, the house is safe.
No babies were born in the gym.

368
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,296
We may all return to our lives.
Come here, come here. Life is great.

369
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:19,734
- Are you drunk?
- Only on life, my darling.

370
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:22,019
And $500 worth of wine.

371
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,749
I'm driving.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
