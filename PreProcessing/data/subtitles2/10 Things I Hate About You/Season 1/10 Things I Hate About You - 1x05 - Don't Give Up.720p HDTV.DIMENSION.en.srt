1
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:05,927
Let's go.

2
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,212
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:12,389
Just wrapping up
another day in paradise.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,803
Listen, about the other day.
I just wanted to say...

5
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,428
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,361
I shouldn't have gone through your bag
or stabbed you in the foot.

7
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:23,009
Ah, don't sweat it.
But, uh, let's keep our distance.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,745
The doctor said it would heal faster
if I reduced the amount of crazy in my life.

9
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:31,236
Crazy?
I'm not crazy.

10
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:36,113
Yes, I'm talking to myself.
It's a sign of genius.

11
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:41,979
Go home and prop it up with pillows.
It'll really get the blood flowing.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,552
I think it's getting better.

13
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:46,260
I only had to take three pain pills
to get through the day.

14
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,697
I'm sure it will be fine
by Friday's game.

15
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:56,141
Janelle pulled her Achilles.
She'll never be okay by Friday's game.

16
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:59,563
- I might get to cheer.
- Nice duplicity, Judas.

17
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:05,894
Well, actually, I feel bad for her
and happy for me at the same time.

18
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:08,432
Pulling an Achilles tendon
is a big deal, Bianca.

19
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:12,258
- Sometimes, it requires surgery.
- Oh, my God. Poor Janelle.

20
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,873
She might be out for months.

21
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:17,596
Ugh, what a hypocrite.

22
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:24,201
Who's the hypocrite now?

23
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:32,880
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

24
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,132
...and then I realized,
I am a hypocrite.

25
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,015
How can I call myself an environmentalist
when I'm single-handedly...

26
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:44,392
exterminating polar bears
in my Chernobyl-mobile?

27
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,786
Why don't you just convert
your car into a biodiesel?

28
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:51,538
My cousin Jamie did it in a day.
If he could do it, you definitely can.

29
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,438
He still wets the bed.

30
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:58,345
I would be dispelling that whole gender
stereotype that women can't fix cars.

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,223
Pro-environment and pro-female.

32
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,671
Mandella, I love this idea.
You're a genius.

33
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,714
I'm the Marcy
to your peppermint patty.

34
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:08,830
Oh, Bianca, hi. I had something
I wanted to tell you.

35
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:11,843
What was it? Oh, right.
I'm not gay.

36
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:15,207
Oh. Sorry, Cameron.

37
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,469
I don't know why
I'd even think that.

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,420
Maybe it's because you're so sweet
and sensitive and you watch project runway.

39
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:26,002
Because of sexy Heidi Klum,
and the way she says "auf wiedersehen".

40
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,638
- I'm straight.
- Oh, got to go.

41
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,042
Remind to give you back
your Dreamgirls DVD later.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,583
I'm not into musicals.

43
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:37,446
I'm into Motown.

44
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:40,677
Hi, Chastity. Hi, Joey.
Your hair looks great today.

45
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,565
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

46
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,548
So, listen, I wanted to let you know
I memorized all the routines...

47
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,618
in case you need somebody
to fill in for Janelle on Friday night.

48
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:54,203
Oh, I don't think I can help you with that,
but you get a big "P" for persistence.

49
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:58,441
Don't forget, it takes ten girls
to make a pyramid.

50
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,898
Do you mind sharing the top
with Michelle?

51
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,499
Um, Joey, honey,
shift to neutral, okay?

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,804
- Shift?
- Stay here.

53
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:15,211
Okay, Joey's about to dip
below the GPA threshold for football.

54
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,741
He needs a "B" on his
chemistry project, or he can't play.

55
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,533
Get it for him,
and you cheer Friday.

56
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:24,543
But I'm not Joey's lab partner.
Mandy is.

57
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,144
And Mandy's on her second
sophomore year, so make it happen.

58
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:32,334
And go light on the jewelry.
He's easily distracted.

59
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:42,658
So what's distracting you
from setting the table?

60
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,827
I'm turning my giant carbon footprint
into a cute little baby foot...

61
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:47,894
by converting my car
into a biodiesel.

62
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,607
- Huh, by yourself?
- You think a woman can't do it?

63
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:53,616
Sure she can, if she's a mechanic.
You do realize...

64
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:56,874
that this is your only car, and if you
destroy it, I'm not getting you another one.

65
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,064
Relax, dad.

66
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:01,579
I printed a comprehensive
instruction manual off the internet.

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,449
Got nine out of ten stars.

68
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,122
Kat, I'm sure somewhere on the internet,
there's a manual on how to deliver a baby...

69
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:10,744
but it doesn't mean you know
your way around a uterus.

70
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:13,761
Why can't my dad
just be an accountant?

71
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:18,830
As long as she thinks you're gay, she's never
going to see you as leading man material.

72
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:22,475
You're like Hugh Jackman
before he was Wolverine.

73
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,964
Which means, if you want
to run up your sex appeal...

74
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,115
- you need--
- Adamantium claws.

75
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:32,170
No. No.
A- a- a big-screen movie moment.

76
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,611
Visualize with me.

77
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,982
- What am I seeing?
- You.

78
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:39,162
Got it.

79
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,468
- On Bianca's doorstep.
- Yes.

80
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,040
- Wet.
- Okay.

81
00:04:43,122 --> 00:04:44,634
And shirtless.

82
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:48,295
- What? Why am I shirtless, exactly?
- Because it's sexy.

83
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,161
Trust me,
girls eat this stuff up.

84
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,690
So I show up at her house,
shirtless and wet.

85
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,771
- Yeah.
- Then what do I say?

86
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,506
You don't say anything.

87
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:04,979
You just take her in your arms
and lay a fat one on her.

88
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:12,135
So really, this is less
like Hugh Jackman...

89
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:15,596
and more like Ryan Gosling
in the notebook.

90
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:20,981
Yeah, you see, it's that kind of comment
that makes people wonder.

91
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:26,577
- Hey.
- I'm your new lab partner.

92
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:28,003
Where's Mandy?

93
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:33,052
She really wanted to work with Leon,
so I swapped her seats.

94
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:36,631
- Okay.
- So, um, I was thinking that...

95
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:40,344
we can get together after school today
at my house and start working on our project.

96
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:41,631
Uh, okay.

97
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:45,532
Which do you want to pick? There's effects
of pressure on the volume of a gas...

98
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:49,503
- density determination, or--
- What kind of snacks do you have?

99
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:52,869
Do you have those little baby
carrot sticks? I love those.

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,124
Yeah.
I can get carrot sticks.

101
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,007
Okay.

102
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:58,780
Density determination it is.

103
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:11,238
Well, there she is. Little lady
who thinks she can convert a car...

104
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,573
using a manual she found
on the internet.

105
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,667
All because she believes in
the hype about global warming.

106
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,698
I'm sorry,
is this auto shop or 1952?

107
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:22,170
You're just like my wife.

108
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:26,907
After watching some show on HGTV,
she tried to rewire an antique lamp.

109
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:31,292
- Almost electrocuted herself.
- Maybe it was a botched suicide attempt.

110
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:35,286
Try not to break a nail.
Back to work, boys.

111
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,302
- Don't even bother.
- Excuse me?

112
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:59,142
Oh, Brad, I'm a girl.
I can't do anything for myself.

113
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,664
Please help me.

114
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:02,994
Just because I'm husky
doesn't mean I'm so desperate...

115
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:05,502
for a pity flirt that I'll work
my butt off for you.

116
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,309
Girls and your witchy ways.

117
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:11,779
No. No.
Not falling for that again.

118
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:16,696
- I guess a cuddle is out of the question.
- You can cuddle with me, kitten.

119
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:21,204
I like a woman who has
no idea what she's doing.

120
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:24,295
I just need a crowbar, and when
I find one, you may want to run.

121
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:27,612
And I'll run slow,
so you could catch me.

122
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,896
Hey.
Can I borrow your crowbar?

123
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,552
You got to be kidding me.

124
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:48,531
Okay, so first, we need to measure
the mass of a clean, dry object.

125
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:52,580
This will do. And we put it on
the laboratory balance, and...

126
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,959
These would be really hard to peel.

127
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,097
I guess that's why they come
like this in the bag.

128
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:01,404
Um, Joey, over here.

129
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,685
I'm sorry.
I'm just bored.

130
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:08,469
Look, we just need to power through this
so that we can get a good grade.

131
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,918
And why-- why do I need
a good grade?

132
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,576
So you can get into college
and play football and stuff.

133
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,069
But I want to be a model.

134
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,341
How's football and college
going to help my runway walk?

135
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:21,608
Wow. You're really serious
about this modeling stuff.

136
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:25,911
I keep my body fat at 4%,
I sleep in paraffin wax...

137
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:30,808
and I even taped off a runway
in my bedroom. Modeling's my dream.

138
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,690
- Nobody gets it.
- I do.

139
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,848
I'm a dreamer, too.
I even have a dream book.

140
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:40,051
- What's a dream book?
- Oh, my God.

141
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,655
Only the greatest thing in the world.

142
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:47,360
I've separated it into actionable goals
from now until the year 2024.

143
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,980
On deck currently,
become a cheerleader.

144
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,371
20 says she quits
by the end of the day.

145
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:03,040
Ah, come on. If everyone bets against her,
there's no point in having a pool.

146
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,021
Patrick, you want to bet on her?

147
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,488
Not while she's
anywhere near power tools.

148
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:15,413
I'll bet on myself.

149
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:19,511
Careful. That money could
buy you a bunch of tampons.

150
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:30,587
Listen. For the record, I didn't even know
you were in auto shop, okay?

151
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:34,306
So if you think I'm here for you,
you're sadly mistaken.

152
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:36,234
Hey!

153
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:40,751
What the hell?

154
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:43,179
- Oh, my--
- I got it.

155
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,739
Can we just agree on...

156
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:53,096
a minimum, safe distance
or do I have to file a restraining order?

157
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,667
Don't flatter yourself.
And I'm not leaving until I'm finished.

158
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,669
And then, in about 15 years...

159
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,462
after I sold my cosmetics line
to a major conglomerate...

160
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:15,080
I'll start adopting babies
from all over the world.

161
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,793
Starting with Uzbekistan.

162
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:21,802
Wow. And all I want is to be
the first male supermodel.

163
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:26,222
And no, I don't count Tyson Beckford.
He doesn't have a fragrance.

164
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:32,222
- Hello?
- Get back to work.

165
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,467
Uh, Chastity...

166
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:36,805
- where are you?
- Behind you.

167
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,302
Just kidding.

168
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:43,355
Listen, Joey has the attention span
of a cheerio, so keep him focused, okay?

169
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:50,252
Okay, sweet dreams
to the dreams book.

170
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,403
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

171
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:59,407
I-- I'll just--
Put this in the washer.

172
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:02,470
And then the dryer,
and then...

173
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,326
back on you.

174
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,665
Don't worry.
Models got to be naked a lot.

175
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,868
It's good practice.

176
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:22,521
Hey, Bian--
Joey Donner.

177
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:25,413
In the flesh.
Do I know you?

178
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:29,554
Cameron James. We've been going
to the same school since first grade.

179
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,686
- Cameron.
- Cameron James.

180
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:35,727
Cameron James.
Oh, Bianca's gay friend.

181
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,212
Man, I- I really admire you
for busting stereotypes.

182
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:41,531
I'm actually trying to do
the same thing.

183
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:44,540
I want to show the world
that straight guys can be models...

184
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,363
in the same way that you're trying
to show the world that--

185
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:50,940
that gay guys don't have
to have six-pack abs.

186
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,260
Yeah.

187
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,743
- You looking for Bianca?
- Nope. Just out jogging.

188
00:11:57,827 --> 00:12:00,034
Dude, you sweat a lot.

189
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:02,921
It's, uh, been a problem.
Sweating.

190
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,246
So just do me a favor.
Don't tell her I was here.

191
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,084
- Oh, okay.
- At all.

192
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,795
Ever? Okay.
See you later, Cameron.

193
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:13,594
Hey, you have a good jog.

194
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,208
Sticky.

195
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:40,024
Ow, ow, ow. We're just working
on a science project.

196
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,104
My daughter is not, and never will be,
enrolled in anatomy.

197
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:46,942
- No. Science.
- Dad!

198
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,881
Look, I'm a surgeon. Come back here again
like that, I'm going to cut something off.

199
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:54,911
Daddy, I'll be back in a second. Put your
head between your legs and breathe deeply.

200
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:57,228
Count to ten.

201
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:00,854
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,994
He has some sort of disease
that makes him cranky.

203
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:06,882
- I think it's "manopause".
- No worries.

204
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:10,079
Um, you should have
something to wear home.

205
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:13,098
- Yeah.
- Here.

206
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,765
Thanks.

207
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:18,205
Sorry.
It's kind of small.

208
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:24,702
Wow. I guess it's true.
Real models can wear anything.

209
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,448
Thanks, Bianca.

210
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:38,114
Wow. You know,
most people have a forehead.

211
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,588
You've got a five-head.

212
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,561
Five. I mean, that's what all
the big agencies are looking for.

213
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:47,386
It's like a billboard on your face.

214
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,614
- I never knew that.
- Yeah.

215
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:53,691
- Your face is perfect.
- No.

216
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,975
Yours is...

217
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:02,378
which is why you shouldn't let
them hurt it at the football game.

218
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:06,159
Your face is your moneymaker.
See you tomorrow.

219
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:09,438
Dad, in and out.

220
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:18,351
Come on, kitten. Give up.
Luis will take you to dinner.

221
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,809
Thanks, but I've got
a granola bar in my bag.

222
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,184
Girls like you always have granola bars,
and then you get mad at guys like me...

223
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:26,427
because we eat red meat.
Well, guess what?

224
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:29,141
I don't care what you think.
I'm going to clean up on this bet...

225
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:34,358
and I'm going to spend your money on porn
and cigars and women who don't talk back.

226
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,927
Well, make sure you
save some for therapy.

227
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:40,844
And maybe you should save some
for anger management.

228
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,604
- Aw, Kat.
- Don't say it.

229
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,185
I know. You were right.
I can't do this.

230
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,082
Have some lasagna.

231
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,648
Thanks.

232
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:14,021
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
- This is a car, not a uterus.

233
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:18,823
- You just would have called a mechanic.
- A mechanic. What a good idea.

234
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,518
I should be able to do this myself.
I'm not some damsel in distress.

235
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,743
No, you're my
"I don't give a damsel" in distress.

236
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:30,287
You're also the most
stubborn person I know.

237
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:33,064
Remember your hunger strike
in third grade?

238
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,449
It worked.
They put a salad bar in.

239
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,228
The point is that...

240
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:41,829
you dig your heels in and never let go,
but sometimes it's okay to ask for help.

241
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,722
Let's go home and we'll call
a mechanic in the morning.

242
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:47,910
Nope.

243
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,042
I can do this.

244
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:55,300
- Honey, this is crazy.
- No, it's perseverance.

245
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,705
I'm not going to let him
be right about me.

246
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,963
Him who?

247
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:01,751
The proverbial him,
meaning...

248
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:07,473
all the guys in this stupid shop class.
They all bet money that I would fail.

249
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:10,176
All right.

250
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:15,534
We can figure this out.
You've got me till my C-section at 8 a.m.

251
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,135
Can't believe they gave this thing
nine out of ten stars. This is stupid.

252
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:21,060
It doesn't even make--

253
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:25,733
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:30,360
Usually when teenagers have their shirts off
and are wet, magic happens.

255
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:33,303
Magic might have happened.
Just not with me.

256
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:36,638
Okay, okay, new movie.
Black Hawk Down.

257
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,126
You're dropped into Somalia
with no chance for victory.

258
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,402
It's time to cut your losses
and retreat.

259
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:44,995
This isn't war, Michael.
This is love.

260
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:48,068
- And love's a battlefield.
- How am I supposed to do that?

261
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:50,245
We're in the same classes.
I'm her French tutor.

262
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:53,296
It's not like I can be medevaced
out of her life.

263
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:56,550
Aversion therapy.
Put this on your wrist.

264
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,575
Every time you think
about Bianca, snap it.

265
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:02,663
Rumor has it this is how
Jen got over Brad.

266
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,306
Oh, oh, there she is.
Do it.

267
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,680
Oh, God!

268
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,427
What the hell happened with Joey?

269
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:20,005
I spilled grape soda on him,
so I was just trying--

270
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:23,860
No, no, no, no. No.
Why is he quitting football?

271
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,041
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing.

272
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:29,835
I would never tell him to quit football.
I'm sucking up to you, remember?

273
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:34,400
Did you or did you not
tell him to protect his face?

274
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,580
I was just being cute.

275
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:40,469
Mmm.
Cute.

276
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:44,713
Cute is that cute little kitty
on YouTube playing "chopsticks".

277
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,283
Get him back on the team, or you'll be
logging more hours in your mascot suit...

278
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:51,745
than the freaks
at a furry convention.

279
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:59,478
- Joey.
- Five-head!

280
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:03,574
I feel as if I may have lead
you down the wrong path.

281
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:07,161
There's so much competition
in the modeling world. It's really cutthroat.

282
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:11,034
Which is why I made
my very own dream book.

283
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,829
- You inspired me.
- You made a dream book?

284
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,582
Yeah, and I put it into sections,
just like you.

285
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,881
One, develop my signature
runway walk...

286
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,971
two, clear up my "bacne",
and three...

287
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:24,576
- wax my--
- Joey.

288
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:29,156
Dream books are just for fun.
They don't actually make anything happen.

289
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:33,357
The odds are stacked against you.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

290
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:36,812
You don't think I could be a model?

291
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:46,140
I think you'll be a great model.

292
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,816
Which is why you should play football.

293
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:52,525
How can football help me?
It's not face-friendly.

294
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:55,867
Oh, look at David Beckham. He's one
of the biggest male models in the world.

295
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,399
He even has a fragrance.
And how did he get that?

296
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,474
- By playing?
- Soccer.

297
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:05,078
- Which in England is called?
- Soccer.

298
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,627
Football.

299
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,567
By playing football, you'll increase
your chances at getting discovered.

300
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,931
You're right!
Bianca, you're so smart.

301
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:16,467
I got to go tell the coach
before he gives my jersey away.

302
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:18,678
Um, don't worry.
It has your name on it.

303
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,249
I know, which is why I don't want him
to give it away. Duh.

304
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,898
Did you remember to recalibrate
your flux capacitor?

305
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:36,119
This is a straight veggie oil conversion,
not a time machine.

306
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,786
Kitten, stock fuel pumps
can't handle the thicker veggie oil.

307
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:46,375
That's why I've rigged a parallel auxiliary
fuel pump that's switchable at the dash.

308
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,463
- You did that yourself?
- Didn't even break a nail.

309
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:55,069
I think I love you for real.
No joke.

310
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:08,159
Please start. Please start.
Please start. Please start.

311
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,134
Pay up.

312
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,572
- This will buy a lot of crisco.
- Ah.

313
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:29,942
Okay. I'm impressed.
So you're going to take her for a ride?

314
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:33,250
Yup. Now we can really
keep our distance.

315
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,103
Oh.

316
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,693
Bye, fellas.

317
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:53,086
Cameron, guess what?
I get to cheer today.

318
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,876
The uniform doesn't fit, but who cares?
You'll be there, right?

319
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:58,036
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Yay!

320
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,402
You know what?
I don't want to get over her.

321
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:07,358
I want to be the guy in the movie
who never gives up...

322
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,335
and eventually gets the girl.

323
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,995
Yeah.
I don't watch those movies.

324
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,305
Unless there's nudity.

325
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:16,895
What?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
