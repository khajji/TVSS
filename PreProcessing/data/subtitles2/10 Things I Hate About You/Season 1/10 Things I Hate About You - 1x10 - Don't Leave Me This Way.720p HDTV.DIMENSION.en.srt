1
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,257
I don't want to go in there.

2
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:10,613
What are you talking about?
You love it in there.

3
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:13,718
Hey, free the naked mole rats.
Ripping.

4
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:15,981
I was the "girl gone wild"
this past weekend.

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,532
All you did was throw
an awesome pretty.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,068
If I tell you something,
do you promise not to be judgy?

7
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:23,771
Thanks for the buzz!
Whoo!

8
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:27,429
Apparently I shaved that guy's head,
so I'm in no position to be judgy.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,894
After Chastity left,
Joey and I...

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,409
kind of made out for,
like, two seconds.

11
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,457
- Way to go, Sienna Miller.
- Judgy.

12
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:38,782
This is why I don't want to go in there.
The guilt is killing me. What do I do?

13
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,448
Either live with the guilt
or tell Chastity.

14
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:45,335
I would, but I prefer to keep
my intestines inside my body.

15
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:49,063
Ugh! At least you know
what to feel guilty about.

16
00:00:57,363 --> 00:01:00,039
Five-head!
It's me, Joey.

17
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:04,389
Just pretend I'm a guy
reading the newspaper.

18
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:07,312
I don't want Chastity
to see us talking.

19
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:09,819
It's okay. She doesn't know
anything happened between us.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,167
And she never will
once we get our stories straight.

21
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:15,532
That is our story.
Nothing happened.

22
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,682
Oh, gotcha.

23
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:19,453
Bianca.

24
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:27,038
Good news, baby.
The war in "Azerbijackistan" is over.

25
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:31,403
Okay, his behavior's
becoming so erratic.

26
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:34,526
He's like my grandma
before we put her on meds.

27
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,078
Seemed fine to me.

28
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,556
Whatever. I'm not here for that.
I'm here to spread joy.

29
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,933
You know how I've been dying
to make you a cheerleader for months?

30
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,483
Oh-- No.

31
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,710
Of course I have.
You're my best friend.

32
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:49,489
Anyway, Janelle has mono so bad
she has to eat through a tube.

33
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,236
Oh, my God.
Is she going to be okay?

34
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:54,286
She'll be fine. It's her own fault.
She'll kiss anything.

35
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:57,147
And this comes on the heels
of that fainting spell...

36
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:59,927
and her stupid Achilles,
and I am done.

37
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,685
This is cheerleading,
not Grey's Anatomy.

38
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,637
- You're taking her spot.
- I'm a cheerleader?

39
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:08,678
Yay! I love it
when dreams come true.

40
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,708
Here, try to sound sincere
when you sign her "get well" card.

41
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:24,179
Just so you know, I was really drunk
Saturday night, like Mel Gibson drunk.

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,081
You don't remember
what you said, do you?

43
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,334
I'm like one of those
soap opera actors with amnesia.

44
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:30,059
Whatever I said, I was joking.

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,470
Oh, trust me,
you were dead serious.

46
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:35,960
- Please, just tell me.
- Nah, I want to save this.

47
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,005
People, just think of this
as airport security.

48
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:43,314
Only instead of going to Hawaii
so you can sip on mai tais...

49
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:47,422
you're going to school so you can
drink up a little bit of knowledge.

50
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:50,853
Excuse me, little lady. I'm going
to have to inspect this carry-on here.

51
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:54,334
- You have no right to do that.
- Oh, I do now. Bam!

52
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:57,606
School board enacted it's own
little Patriot Act last night...

53
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,921
and I am the new Dick Cheney.

54
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:03,013
Uh-oh. I'm going
to have to confiscate this.

55
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:06,653
Well, Dick, you better pray
I don't get cramps.

56
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,700
Got my eye on you.

57
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:15,243
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

58
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,798
"End fascism now"?

59
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,733
Is this because I blocked Showtime?
You don't need to make a poster.

60
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,374
- We can just talk about it.
- No.

61
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,210
The administration has instituted these
completely unconstitutional new rules.

62
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:32,097
Look at these.
It's like going to high school in Cuba.

63
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,339
More than 10 students
need permission to assemble.

64
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,610
School has the right to search lockers.
No drugs or weapons.

65
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:41,483
Oh, my God! Do you mean to tell me the students
have to leave their Uzis and heroin at home?

66
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:44,784
- Dad, this isn't a joke.
- How about knives and crack?

67
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:48,627
They're trampling our civil rights.
This time they've gone too far.

68
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,677
Even the mindless mouth-breathers at Padua High
will be marching to the tune of justice.

69
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:55,744
Why do I get the feeling
this isn't going to end well?

70
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:57,476
Daddy, look.

71
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,696
My little cheerleader!

72
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,752
Did you ever think
today would come?

73
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:06,209
Finally, one of your daughters
makes something of herself.

74
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,553
I'm never taking this off.

75
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,129
Sounds like someone hasn't read
the new security policy.

76
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,453
Are you going on about Cuba again?
[speaks Spanish] to that.

77
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,352
Ah.

78
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,669
They're making us wear uniforms.

79
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,532
What? No!

80
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:23,541
No, no! I finally clawed
my way to the top...

81
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,732
so that I could have the honor
of wearing this cute little outfit to school.

82
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,910
They can't take that
away from me!

83
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:31,369
This is inhumane.

84
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,424
I can't believe she thinks it's okay
to say these things out loud.

85
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:38,163
Well, it is
her First Amendment right.

86
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,652
Funny.

87
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:42,894
Ugh! I can't believe
this is happening to me.

88
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:46,798
These uniforms-- I know. How are we supposed
to express ourselves through fashion?

89
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,838
No, Joey and I broke up.

90
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:50,412
You did?

91
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,023
- Why?
- Guys are such pigs.

92
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:57,356
Did he tell you he was studying for trig
when he was really studying Kelly Morris?

93
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,344
Do you think he would cheat
on this test?

94
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:00,337
- No.
- Uh-uh.

95
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,323
Never. Not even if it
were multiple choice.

96
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,017
But why did you guys break up?

97
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:09,020
Well, you know that college boy
that was hitting on me at your party?

98
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,772
- Who could blame him?
- I know.

99
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,794
Well, then, Joey turned
into this possessive freak.

100
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:17,061
I thought actors were bad,
but models are so much worse.

101
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:18,879
So I couldn't lose.

102
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:21,735
Oh. When I told him,
he started sobbing.

103
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,008
I hate it when guys cry.
It's like--

104
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,488
Fine. Be sensitive, but don't,
like, slobber all over me.

105
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:30,542
I'm the one that wants to cry.
I finally get back into circulation...

106
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:33,603
and now I have to wear
this stupid uniform.

107
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:35,091
Amen.

108
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,814
- It's un-American.
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,399
These are our civil rights, people.

110
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,210
Yes, you, too.
You, too.

111
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,923
Throwing another party?
Woman, you are an animal!

112
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,591
We have to ban together and fight.

113
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:49,794
- Who we gonna save?
- Naked mole rats!

114
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:53,619
Screw the stupid mole rats!
This is about our freedom!

115
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,281
I don't think half these kids
can spell "freedom".

116
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:00,678
- Wanna help hand out flyers?
- Yeah-- No.

117
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,123
But I was thinking after school
we could head to the beach.

118
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,982
At your party,
you said you wanted to go.

119
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:06,778
- I did?
- No.

120
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:10,114
Can you please just
hand these out in auto shop?

121
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,336
I'll put them on the table,
but I'm not passing them out.

122
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:16,047
- Gee, thanks. That's so supportive.
- This is your thing, not mine.

123
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,590
So you don't give a damn that
we no longer have the rights...

124
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,182
that are guaranteed to us
in the Bill of Rights?

125
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,048
Must be nice
not to care about anything.

126
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,908
Well, what's the point?
It's not like we can change it.

127
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,724
I'll tell you what. Come to the beach,
and I'll tell you what you said.

128
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,254
What's the point?
It's not like I can change it.

129
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,174
Cameron, we have to talk.

130
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:45,378
I love you,
but you don't feel the same way.

131
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,581
- What more is there to say?
- Cameron, wait.

132
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm so sorry. The last thing
I'd ever want to do is hurt you.

133
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,805
You're my best friend.
You're smart and funny...

134
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:59,782
and you're the only person
who knows I like to watch 60 Minutes.

135
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:03,374
And I miss you...
so much.

136
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:06,417
I miss you more.

137
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,160
Do you think we could
go back to being friends?

138
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:13,311
I don't know.
I guess we could try.

139
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:16,897
Yay! So I'll see you
at French tutoring.

140
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,950
Au revoir, mon ami.

141
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,423
"You're my best friend"?

142
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,892
First, you already got
a best friend.

143
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:30,810
And second, she's just
not that into you.

144
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:35,614
Hey, she's still transitioning into
seeing me as a viable heterosexual.

145
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,227
Are you hearing the words
that are coming out of your mouth?

146
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:42,499
Despite everything, I still feel that Bianca
and I are meant to be together.

147
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,821
Haven't you ever known something
deep in your heart?

148
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:47,714
I'm 15.
I know things deep in my pants.

149
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:51,538
That's why I don't waste my time
on chicks that aren't into me.

150
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,482
Michael, a foundation of friendship
is the best gift you can give a relationship.

151
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,558
See? This is what happens when
you don't have a strong father figure.

152
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:07,077
I did not approve this flyer, Kat.
Although I love your font choice.

153
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,200
The only approval I need
is the First Amendment.

154
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,302
- In fact, I--
- Yeah, yeah. Kumbaya.

155
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:13,413
- Just don't do it again.
- I will do it again.

156
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:16,331
And again and again
until you change this policy.

157
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,744
I'm an Energizer Bunny for liberty.

158
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:23,011
Do you think I like this?
Look at all this new paperwork.

159
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:25,863
Duplicates, triplicates, quad--

160
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,122
I'm so swamped,
I had to cancel my foot massage...

161
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:34,425
which I depend on to keep me
from screaming at you people...

162
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:36,920
to leave me the hell alone!

163
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:42,595
Then lift the policy.
You can make all of this go away.

164
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,250
I'm just a cog in the machine...

165
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:48,439
a tool of the man.

166
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,992
Hey, I think that's my ibuprofen.

167
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,341
The bottom line is...

168
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,232
the superintendent enacted this.

169
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:07,756
We follow it, or we don't get funding,
and I get fired. So we're both stuck.

170
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:11,308
Unless you can convince her
to change it.

171
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,870
"Her"? I thought
the superintendent is a man.

172
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,901
He is. I was talking about
his daughter, Chastity.

173
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:19,357
And what Chastity wants,
Chastity gets.

174
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,835
- Yes, but Chastity hates me.
- Oh, no.

175
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:26,663
This revolution stuff is hard.
Waah!

176
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:31,706
There's Joey. Hope he doesn't do
that sobbing thing again.

177
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:34,781
- Hey, five-head, can we talk?
- Bye.

178
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:37,455
So I heard you and Chastity broke up.
Are you okay?

179
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:40,925
I'm more than okay.
I'm the maximum okayness there is.

180
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,705
In fact, you wanna go out
on Saturday?

181
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:47,322
You, me, out, together.

182
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:50,955
Yummy. Dinner.
I'm buying.

183
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,266
Joey, I would love
to go out with you.

184
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,345
But it's too soon.
You and Chastity just broke up.

185
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:02,345
We shouldn't even be seen
talking together.

186
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,457
Hey, she broke up with me.

187
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:07,318
I don't even know if she ever loved me.
Not the real me.

188
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,689
I was just this gorgeous status accessory,
like Paris Hilton's poodle.

189
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,958
Girls like Chastity don't like other girls
playing with their poodles...

190
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,010
even if they've given
their poodles away.

191
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:19,297
And Chastity
can be really mean.

192
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:23,247
That's why I'm ready to be
with someone really sweet, like you.

193
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:26,479
Take you, for example.

194
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,293
No. I can't do this.

195
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:37,128
I just became a cheerleader.

196
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,815
Yeah, I mean
I just got tired of him.

197
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,531
Sure, he's good-looking and all,
but I've got that covered.

198
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,137
- Chastity, can we talk?
- Nope.

199
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,839
It's first period. I only deal
with unpleasant things after third.

200
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,970
I'm on a mission of peace.
I need your help.

201
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:05,136
I know you do, but I only give
one makeover a year...

202
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:08,798
and I already helped Tori.
Mmm! Boy, was that hard.

203
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:11,888
This is important.

204
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:15,075
Doesn't it bother you that we're all
being treated like suspected criminals?

205
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,944
Hmm.
No, not really.

206
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:20,699
Fine. Doesn't it bother you that
you have to wear that outfit again?

207
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,697
Oh, that bothers me so much.

208
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:26,204
We should do something about it.

209
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,252
Can you get me
a meeting with your dad?

210
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,991
It's pointless.
I already asked him, and he said no.

211
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:33,426
I even cried real tears.

212
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,758
Then we'll stage a walkout.

213
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:38,433
We'll refuse to go back inside
until they lift the regulations.

214
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:41,028
It'll work
if the whole school does it.

215
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,556
And the only person who can get
the whole school to do something is you.

216
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,005
That's true.

217
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,628
But it all sounds
really exhausting.

218
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:53,902
Free these kids from their uniforms,
and you'll be a legend.

219
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:57,239
I'm thinking fourth period.

220
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:58,816
Great idea.

221
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,187
- Great idea.
- Thanks.

222
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:13,927
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

223
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:18,229
Shh!

224
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:21,183
Guys, this is a walkout,
not recess.

225
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,706
Shh! Shh.

226
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,205
Guys, come on!
Be quiet, please!

227
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:31,897
Shut up and listen to her!

228
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,872
We are here today
because our Constitutional rights...

229
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:45,640
do not start the day
we graduate from this hellhole.

230
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,419
We deserve dignity
and respect now.

231
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,399
After all, we're not just
stupid teenagers.

232
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,005
We are citizens
of the United States of America.

233
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,808
When I say "uniforms",
you say "suck"!

234
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,652
- Uniforms!
- Suck!

235
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:14,098
Infringement on civil liberties!

236
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:16,335
- Huh?
- What?

237
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,217
Suck!

238
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:21,313
Don't confuse them.

239
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:24,602
- Uniforms!
- Suck!

240
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:27,191
* My country, 'tis of thee *

241
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:32,158
- Sing louder, people! Louder!
* Sweet land of liberty *

242
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:36,197
* Of thee I sing *

243
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:40,973
* Land where my fathers died *

244
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:42,728
Five-head!

245
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:46,439
- You're as light as a balloon.
- What are you doing?

246
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,022
I couldn't stay away.
I need a kiss to get me through the day.

247
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:52,333
But I thought we agreed
we were going to sneak around.

248
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:55,346
No one's gonna see us.
They're all singing gospel.

249
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:58,425
Come on, five-o.
Just one smooch...

250
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,457
and I'll never ask you
for another favor again.

251
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:05,058
* Let freedom ring *

252
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:09,995
* Let freedom ring *

253
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:14,232
* Let freedom ring *

254
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,720
* Let freedom ring *

255
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,335
* Let freedom ring *

256
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:25,070
* Let freedom ring *

257
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,874
* Let freedom ring *

258
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,730
* Let freedom ring *
- Everyone, shut up!

259
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah.
Shut up!

260
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:39,920
Chastity, your--
your father's on the phone.

261
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,178
Be strong.

262
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,845
Daddy?
No, you listen to me.

263
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:47,540
Okay? I'm at school
and in this uniform.

264
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,790
Everyone looks the same.

265
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,279
No, I'm not being a brat.

266
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:55,549
Okay, you wanna go there?
We'll go there.

267
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,916
Ditch these stupid uniforms,
or I'll tell Mommy how I found out...

268
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:03,803
that your executive assistant
doesn't wear a bra.

269
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:07,031
Whoo!

270
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,961
S-- I- I understand.

271
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:13,122
Yes, sir. I--

272
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:17,969
Back to class.
No more uniforms.

273
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,246
Yeah!

274
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,024
Whoa. Whoa. Wait!
Our struggle has just begun.

275
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:28,420
Call your dad back. What about our
First and Fourth Amendment rights?

276
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,059
They can still search our lockers!

277
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,270
I don't have time for this crap.
I got my own problem.

278
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:35,097
Yeah! Whoo!

279
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,684
Hey Chastity, great rally.

280
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:45,546
Listen, I wanna talk
to you about Joey.

281
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:49,083
I know. I saw him kissing
that blonde slut, too!

282
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:52,603
I cannot believe that he would
do this to me! Ugh!

283
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,942
- You saw him kissing someone?
- Some... thing.

284
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:58,966
She looked like a--
a toothpick with hair.

285
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:02,514
I couldn't make out her face.
It was probably hideous.

286
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,940
But I thought you said
you were over him.

287
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,512
Thank God they installed
those security cameras.

288
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:09,292
- Security cameras?
- Yeah.

289
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:12,793
All we have to do is review the footage,
and then we'll know who she is.

290
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:16,042
Then you'll help me
destroy her, right?

291
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:19,974
Sure.
We'll get her.

292
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,028
Thanks, B.

293
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:25,297
I don't normally do this, but...

294
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,696
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

295
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,800
What would I do
without you? Mm!

296
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:37,204
* Until we're free *

297
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,506
So, should we sing something else?
How about "Blowin' in the Wind"?

298
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,207
Maybe we'll just sing in our heads.

299
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:46,813
Can't.
Plastic water bottle.

300
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:49,883
- I could pour it in my hand.
- I'd do that, I'm so thirsty.

301
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,033
Eh, we'll recycle 'em.

302
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,824
Dad, I know why you're here.

303
00:16:55,825 --> 00:17:00,078
It's okay. Unchain yourself.
We need to talk. Now, Norma Rae.

304
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:06,294
Be right back.

305
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,457
Did that deep-voiced man-boy
put you up to this?

306
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,028
No. I'm just fighting
for what I believe in.

307
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,126
Principal Holland threatened to suspend you
if you don't stop this right now.

308
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,891
It would go on
your permanent record.

309
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,570
That's just an urban myth to scare
smart kids into submission.

310
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,687
I don't get this, Kat. You always wanted
to go to an Ivy League school.

311
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:23,603
They'll appreciate
my social conscience.

312
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:26,121
No. They'll label you
a problem student.

313
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:29,285
You know how competitive it is.
They'll look for some reason to reject you.

314
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:32,285
It's like enlisting in the army and
writing down, "Oh, by the way, I'm gay."

315
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:36,600
- Oh, I'm against that, too.
- I'm just saying, pick your moments.

316
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:40,632
I can't just give up. That's not
what Mom would have wanted.

317
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,298
Oh, no.
You learned that one from me.

318
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:46,624
Besides, Mom would've wanted you
to see the big picture...

319
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,726
and not be an idiot.

320
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:53,023
Look, you have you whole life
to save the world. Right now...

321
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:55,902
don't give up your dream
of going to Brown.

322
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:00,655
This is not fair.

323
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,970
- I shouldn't have to make this choice.
- Then let me make it for you.

324
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,791
You made your point.
Go back to class.

325
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,085
Got it?

326
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,485
Got it.

327
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,444
Great job, guys.
No more uniforms.

328
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:28,094
The school came together.
I think we can call this a win.

329
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,553
Now we should get back to class.

330
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:31,901
You're kidding, right?

331
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,370
We can regroup
and figure out the next step.

332
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:37,300
After all, none of us
wants to get suspended.

333
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:42,093
Wow.
I guess everyone has their price.

334
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,732
- Why is he so mad?
- He's not mad. He's disappointed.

335
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:49,639
It's going around.

336
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,840
Cameron! Oh, God,
I really need your advice.

337
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:58,211
I just had the most awful thing
happen with Chastity.

338
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:01,216
You're gonna have to tell your problems
to someone else. I can't do this.

339
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,200
Do what?

340
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:05,708
Be your friend, especially while
you're wearing that perfume.

341
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,741
- Then I won't wear it.
- Don't you get it?

342
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,394
I need time to get over you.

343
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,246
I didn't sell out.

344
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,356
I'm just thinking big picture.
I wanna go to a first-rate college...

345
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,842
so I can get a degree in social policy
and change the world.

346
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:31,624
- The real world, not high school.
- You sound like one of them already.

347
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,325
- What the hell?
- Nice bag.

348
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,165
Verona, hand it over.

349
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,318
- Keep it.
- What's going on?

350
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,573
Young man, where do you
think you're going?

351
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:46,108
You walk out of here,
you're suspended.

352
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:48,233
Did you hear what I said?

353
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,283
I wish we could spank them.

354
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:58,156
- Hard.
- Search this.

355
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,470
Then can I keep it?
You said I could keep it.

356
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,201
You have no right
to go through this.

357
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,486
Kat, come back here with that,
or you're suspended, too.

358
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,413
Then I guess I'm suspended.

359
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,969
Fight the power.

360
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,212
* Hey! *

361
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,320
* Owww! *

362
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,488
This is yours.

363
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,864
* I want you *
- You sure about this?

364
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:27,234
* To want me *
- No.

365
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,309
* I need you to need me *
- But I'm doing it.

366
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:35,181
* I'd love you to love me *
- "Hold my hair."

367
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:36,540
Excuse me?

368
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:40,482
That's what you said to me
at your party right before you hurled.

369
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,294
* I want you to want me *
- Nice.

370
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,657
* I said *
- Helmet.

371
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:50,190
* I want you to want me
Yeah *

372
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:54,242
* I want you to want me
Hey! *

373
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:57,696
* I said I want you
Hey! *

374
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,431
* Whooaa! *

375
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,596
* Owww! *

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
