- Previously On "10 Things i Hate About You"...
- it's first day of school, so

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,724
Remember the most important thing,
don't get pregnant. Bye, dad. -You

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:10,452
*** at school.

4
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:14,787
I'm Chasity. this is my boyfriend,
Joey Donner.

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,968
Who is Captain Intensity over there?

6
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:19,604
Patrick Verona. People say he
knows the taste of human flesh.

7
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:22,307
Please. My name's Cameron.

8
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:25,576
I'm so lucky to have met you.
You're my first GBF.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,500
- What...  A GBF?
- Gay best friend.

10
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,928
People are not scared of me.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,067
Sure they are. That's why
I find you interesting.

12
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:33,747
Maybe I'm a really bad boyfriend.

13
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:36,466
You're, like, the perfect boyfriend.

14
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:38,399
All this time we've been friends,
you've liked me?

15
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:42,786
I've loved you. I don't feel the same way.

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,511
You have no right to do that. Bam.

17
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,598
They're making us wear uniforms.

18
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,945
So you don't give a damn that
we no longer have the rights

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,052
that are guaranteed to
us in the Bill of Rights?

20
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,063
What's the point?
It's not like we can change it.

21
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,482
Be quiet, please.

22
00:00:55,517 --> 00:01:00,711
Shut up and listen to her.
Joey and I broke up. I cut him loose.

23
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,310
Come back here with that,
or you're suspended, too.

24
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:08,881
Then I guess I'm suspended.

25
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,893
You sure about this? No.

26
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:12,964
But I'm doing it.

27
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:23,704
Hey, Kat. It's your sister calling
from a deserted parking lot.

28
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:27,148
Oh, hello, creepy man in a van.

29
00:01:27,182 --> 00:01:30,056
I don't need a ride.
My sister's picking me up.

30
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,769
Thanks. Call me.

31
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,741
Hey, Fivehead. Do you need a ride home?

32
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,014
Joey, we can't be seen together.

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,920
Chastity has vowed to dismember
the girl who kissed you,

34
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:42,762
and our make-out sessions won't be
nearly as fun if I have no arms.

35
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:44,331
This sucks.

36
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,645
I just want to shout from the rooftops-
I'm dating Bianca Stratford!

37
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:52,889
That is so sweet,
but could you just mouth it?

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,673
Okay, I have a simple two-step plan

39
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:05,990
to get us through this.
Step 1, we date in secret. Joey.

40
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,329
Oh. Doing them now.

41
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,935
Step 2, we track down the surveillance tape

42
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,073
of our make-out session
before Chastity sees it.

43
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,478
Cool. We could watch it together.

44
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:15,483
So we can erase it.

45
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,788
That's good, too. No bad ideas.

46
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:24,137
Oh, God. Get down. Hi, Chastity.

47
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,806
Hop in, B. I'll give you a ride.
We can play a game. It's called

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Top 10 Ways to Torture the
Skank Who Kissed Joey.

49
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:35,313
I'll go first. Waterboarding, duh.

50
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:39,922
TP her locker? Lame.

51
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:43,697
Put semi-permanent green
dye in her sham-- Mm-mm.

52
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,836
Throw her in the ocean in
a meat bikini. I love it.

53
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:59,426
I can't believe I just did that!

54
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,497
I can't believe I just walked out of school!

55
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:05,471
It was so exciting. I wonder
if Gandhi ever felt like this,

56
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:09,545
so alive, so inspired, so-- Hot.

57
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:16,991
We took a stand. Uh-huh.

58
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:24,003
We told the establishment to stick it.
Yeah, yeah, we're heroes.

59
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,611
Let's go in. Hell, no.

60
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:31,516
And I thought you were a tough guy.

61
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,494
I'm suspended. My dad is going to kill me.

62

63
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,084
I am so stressed out about
this Chastity thing,

64
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:56,355
I can't even enjoy the fact
that Dad is going to kill you.

65
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:01,830
Hi. Dad, I'm so glad you're home.

66
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:03,667
Relax. I just got here. Hi, honey.

67
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,105
Hi, Daddy. So I heard some good news today.

68
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,808
I heard someone got suspended.
Who was it again?

69
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,644
Oh, that's right. It was you.

70
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:12,947
What are you doing? Don't you know
it goes on your permanent record?

71
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:14,449
I thought you were going to drop this.

72
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,352
I was going to, but-- But what?

73
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:19,223
What happened in between me
ordering you back into school

74
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:23,529
and you walking out of it?
I had to stand up for my principles.

75
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,531
They were hassling some guy.
Guy? There's a guy now?

76
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,132
Do you know this guy? What guy? Some guy.

77
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,834
Some-- Some poor kid.

78
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:33,403
Oh, a kid. They were going
to search his backpack.

79
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:37,172
Someone had to intervene before they
performed a full-body cavity search.

80
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:40,140
This is America, not Xinjiang.

81
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,541
Do you notice that this isn't
China or Tibet or Cambodia?

82
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,176
But there is an emperor here, and it's me.

83
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,877
Who, incidentally,
taught me to think for myself.

84
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,213
Oh, no. You can't blame me for this.

85
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,049
You broke the rules. You're going to
have to deal with the consequences.

86
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,051
I know. I'm suspended tomorrow.
No, these consequences.

87
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,886
You're painting the living room tomorrow.

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,921
Just in case you don't get into a college,

89
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,722
now you'll have a skill to make a living.

90
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:06,927
Okay, does the back of this girl's head

91
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,228
look like the back of mine?

92
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,863
No. She doesn't have enough-
What do you call them?

93
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:15,066
Natural highlights. Natural, sure.
What are you doing?

94
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:17,569
All that Chastity knows
about Joey's mystery girl

95
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:20,838
is she's blonde and thin,
so I'm assembling a list of suspects.

96
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,840
Once Chastity sees how huge it is,

97
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:25,175
she'll be overwhelmed and give up.

98
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,277
Thank God we live in California.

99
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,180
Here's a thought.
If you didn't do anything wrong,

100
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:32,949
why not just tell the
Satanic Smurfette the truth?

101
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,583
Like you did? i did?

102
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:37,119
Dad, they were totally going to search

103
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:39,854
some poor kid's bag,
so I had to stand up for his rights

104
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,557
and ride off into the sunset with him
on the back of his bitchen motorcycle.

105
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,792
Bianca, I was standing up for
our constitutional protections.

106
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:52,131
Oh, my God. Shut up.
You're like a live feed from CNN.

107
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:58,536
So I told Bianca I need time to get over her,

108
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,138
then I turned and walked
away without looking back.

109
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:05,140
Yes, yes, I was hoping
you wouldn't look back.

110
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:10,143
Good for you, bro. You finally told her off.

111
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:13,479
When you say it like that, it sounds harsh.

112
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:17,782
Now I feel bad. Maybe I should apologize.

113
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,150
After all, it's not her fault
she doesn't love me back.

114
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,418
Dude, if you really want to get over Bianca,

115
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:25,155
stop making excuses and get angry.

116
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,526
Did you learn anything
from your parents' divorce?

117
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:30,999
I'm not angry. I'm just
hurt and disappointed,

118
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,568
and for some reason,
I can't listen to the radio.

119
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,437
Bianca rejected you, okay?

120
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,505
You gave her your heart,
and she riverdanced over it,

121
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,074
then made out with the
quarterback of the football team.

122
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,877
And you want to apologize?
Not that much anymore.

123
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:53,151
Oh. Hey, Cameron.
How are you? Very well, thank you.

124
00:06:55,955 --> 00:07:00,191
Yeah, buddy. Yes! Hey, bestie.

125
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:03,460
I found out where they keep
the surveillance tapes.

126
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:07,464
You did? Oh, goodie.
They're locked in the AV closet.

127
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,465
I tried to bribe the janitor to open it,

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,134
but he's afraid he'll lose his job.

129
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,803
Like there aren't a million other
bathrooms to clean out there.

130
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,805
Well, darn it. I guess we'll
never get the tape, then.

131
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,806
Well, that's what I thought,
until I remebered

132
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,474
that that tall nerd person friend of yours

133
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,477
is king of the AV club.
Get the key from him, okay?

134
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,179
I'd do it myself, but I don't
want to look petty and vindictive.

135
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,826
You cannot come in.

136
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,028
If my dad sees you here,
his head will explode,

137
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,762
and then I'll have to repaint.

138
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:48,264
Your dad's at work. How's he
going to see me? Hidden cameras?

139
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:51,333
Yes. Come on. I'll help you paint.

140
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,169
It's the least I can do.
After all, you did get suspended for me.

141
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:57,505
Don't flatter yourself.
I got suspended for my principles.

142
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,276
I just fled the scene with you.
Really? Because I think...

143
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:09,182
I'm not kidding. I can't mess around.

144
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:11,450
You don't get the point
of being suspended at all.

145
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:14,119
Day off, no school. It's like a vacation.

146
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:17,455
This is not a vacation.
After I paint this entire room,

147
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,824
I have to study for an English
test I was supposed to take.

148
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,393
If you get suspended on a test day,
you get a zero.

149
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:23,794
Dem's da rules.

150
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:27,464
A zero? No. They'll just
have to make an exception.

151
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:30,632
I don't think they do that.
Not that I've ever tried.

152
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:38,472
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't get a zero.

153
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:42,476
That'll bring down my whole GPA,
and on top of the suspension--

154
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,814
Why did I do something so stupid? I have
ruined my entire life, my whole future.

155
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:50,149
I won't get into Brown.
I won't be able to protect civil liberties

156
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,817
and crusade against injustice.

157
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,487
And I can't even be a house
painter because I suck at it.

158
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,388
Don't you think you're overreacting?

159
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:00,191
It's your first day as a painter.
You'll get better.

160
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:05,429
I'm just kidding.
If this test is that important,

161
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,397
then just break into school and take it.

162
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:10,466
How am I going to do that? With my help.

163
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:26,780
I'm not so sure about this.
What if somebody recognizes me?

164
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,649
Don't worry. With that hood and glasses,
they'll just think you're a celebrity.

165
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,156
Whoa, check it out, dudes.
It's Patrick Verona.

166
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,792
And he brought our favorite
freedom fighter, the Dalai Mama.

167
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,794
Really? Me, your favorite?

168
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,462
Because of you getting
your protesting back out,

169
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:49,465
we got to empty our lockers,
all full to brimming with sweet hydro.

170
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,000
That's exactly what I was fighting for--

171
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,802
Your stash. Could you guys get in

172
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:56,972
and grab the wheel, please,
before the BKWs catch us?

173
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,145
We need passage.

174
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,483
The southwest hall is clear. How do you know?

175
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,884
There's an app for that.

176
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:19,157
Bianca. Joey. Bianca, I got your text.

177
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:22,827
How'd you get out of class?
I told the teacher I was itching.

178
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:24,094
God, you're pretty.

179
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,830
Thanks, but that's not why
I need to talk to you.

180
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:28,832
We have an emergency. Step 2 of our plan

181
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:32,501
is about to go off the rails. Step 2.

182
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:35,637
Destroying the security tape.
Are we done with step 1?

183
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:39,207
No. Step 1 is like the Olympic torch-
It's always going.

184
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:42,610
Now listen-- I need you to
get into Cameron's pants.

185
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,611
He's gay. It shouldn't be that hard.

186
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:48,348
To steal his keys. That's what I thought.

187
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,517
He has gym next period.
Steal his keys. Get them to me.

188
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,519
I'll get the tape, erase it,
then you slip his keys back into his pants

189
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,990
before the class ends.
Do I need to write this down?

190
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:04,294
I don't mean to diss on your plan,
because it's really complicated and awesome,

191
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,963
but why can't you just ask him for the keys?

192
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:10,966
Because he's mad at me. Long story. Strange.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,134
But listen, we need to act fast.

194
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,636
If we don't, Chastity will,
and then we'll have to move to Bolivia.

195
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:19,139
Calm down, Five-o. No one's moving to Africa.

196
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:23,009
I'll get you those keys. Oh, Joey. Bianca.

197
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:36,254
School police. I need to see that hall pass.

198
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,825
This watermark looks like
it was made with diet soda.

199
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,794
Do I look like an idiot to you?

200
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,652
You Out from yurs class to
make out with your boyfriend?

201
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:53,655
Just the last ten minutes. Besides, it's
history. I already know how it ends.

202
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:54,923
Everyone dies.

203
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,825
Aren't you supposed to be
painting the living room?

204
00:11:56,859 --> 00:12:01,596
I have to take an English test.
You broke into school to take a test?

205
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,031
You are so weird.

206
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:05,366
Hi, I'm Joey, Bianca's boyfriend.

207
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,968
We should double sometime.

208
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,204
Joey, we're dating in secret.

209
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,041
Bianca, I think they know.

210
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:15,710
I was never here.

211
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:19,947
You Stratford sisters are a strange breed.

212
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:34,226
Kat? Aren't you suspended?

213
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:40,062
Would I be here if I were suspended? No.
I'd be home watching Oprah.

214
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:42,063
Did you know I was once an
audience member on her show?

215
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:43,730
You don't say.

216
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,731
They gave us all a pair of these tennis shoes

217
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,533
that firm your butt just by wearing them.

218
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,835
That Oprah deserves the Nobel prize.

219
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,436
She is a saint.

220
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,884
Are you trying to steal my keys?

221
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,987
No, no, I was just
admiring them from a-close.

222
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:19,225
Okay, look. Bianca told me that
you guys are kind of in a fight.

223
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,029
Yeah, well, I don't want to talk about it--

224
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:28,702
Especially with you, Joey Donner.
I'm sorry. I understand.

225
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:32,138
Well, not really, but Bianca needs your help.

226
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:34,206
Does she, now? Yep.

227
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,907
See, there's this security tape,

228
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,475
and I'm supposed to get your key, so--

229
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,710
Wait a minute. Let me check my notes.

230
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:45,080
Keys out of pants. Get the keys to Bianca,
who destroys tape, then go--

231
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,383
Are you done? I have a rope to climb.

232
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:52,220
Okay, man to man.
Me and Bianca, we're making out

233
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,055
on a tape that's locked in the AV closet.

234
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,522
We need to get the said tape

235
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:58,460
before Chastity sees it
and bad things happen.

236
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,663
So I'm just a part of her master plan?

237
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:04,299
Yeah, but you're not supposed to know.

238
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, and don't tell anybody that we're dating.

239
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,802
I always forget step 1.

240
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:14,172
So you're dating now? Well, congratulations.

241
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,008
Thanks! Hey, thought--

242
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:21,511
How about you snag the tape for us?
That makes it so much easier.

243
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:24,679
Sure, bro. I'll get you the tape.

244
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,347
And then I'll even sweeten it up,

245
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:29,183
with a little Jay-Z and some cool effects.

246
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:31,351
And then I'll wrap it in a heart-shaped box,

247
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,586
filled with rose petals and wishes.

248
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't bother. We're just going to erase it.

249
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:37,722
But thanks. Up top.

250
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,398
Academic catastrophe averted.

251
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:50,033
I took the test. Actually, I aced the test.

252
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,867
Incense, my ass.

253
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:56,104
I know my incense. I got five different
types of incense in my bathroom.

254
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:59,706
I got sandalwood, old school musk...

255
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:08,148
You've been wanting to do that all day.
Let's get out of here.

256
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:10,651
I still have to finish painting the
living room before my dad gets home.

257
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:14,355
Someone's coming. Shut up. Let's go.

258
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:17,825
Hey, you.

259
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,660
Motorcycle man. You shouldn't be here.

260
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:20,995
Today was fun.

261
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,564
You want to run? Okay. I got you.

262
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,170
Oh!

263
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:38,875
You.

264
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,198
- You Tell Cemron that we dating?
- I had to call an audible.

265
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:49,865
- No.
- He must be so upset.

266
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,166
Not at all.

267
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,300
In fact, he wanted to do this
whole soundtrack thingie.

268
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,669
Uh-oh. Chastity's at 6:00. Now 7. She's at 8.

269
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,504
I can't tell time this fast.
Hang up the phone.

270
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:06,375
Great news, B. Your nerd boy?
He got me the tape.

271
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:09,678
He gave it to you?
You don't want to watch this.

272
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:13,014
Uh, yeah, I do. I do.

273
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:16,483
It's already cued up. I wish we had popcorn.

274
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,151
No, I don't want to wait the three minutes.

275
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,820
Chastity, listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

276
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,389
It's not that big of a deal. There she is.

277
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:26,791
I will never forget those roots. Ugh.

278
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,826
Listen, Chastity, I want you to know

279
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,061
that this shouldn't affect
our friendship in any way,

280
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:34,263
because what you're going
to see is not-- Damn it.

281
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:38,332
Security system's crap. Stupid public school.

282
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,500
I guess we'll never know who she is.

283
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,703
It'll just remain one of life's
mysteries, like Fergie's age.

284
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,171
I can't be the only person who saw them.

285
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,207
I mean, you know what?
We'll start interrogating people.

286
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,209
Eventually, some nut will crack.

287
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:55,346
Chastity, can you just explain
to me one teeny, tiny thing?

288
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,283
You dumped Joey.

289
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:01,318
Why do you care who he kissed?

290
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:04,955
Because-- Because...

291
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:09,457
it's humiliating.

292
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:11,725
It didn't even take him a day to get over me.

293
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:18,263
When he kissed that sloor,
he probably still had the taste

294
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,198
of my strawberry ultimate shine
lip quencher on his mouth.

295
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:25,403
Whoever that girl is,
she can't compare to you.

296
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:28,039
You are the most popular girl at this school.

297
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:29,039
You're the youngest head cheerleader

298
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:32,842
in the history of Padua High.
You are Chastity freaking Church.

299
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,644
You're right.

300
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,913
You're right. I'm me, and she is nothing.

301
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,949
A nobody. A nasty, mangy piece of garbage.

302
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:42,718
Okay.

303
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:45,153
Thank you for reminding me how amazing I am.

304
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:47,722
I am so glad we're besties. Air hug.

305
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,426
Oh, and give that back to nerd boy.

306
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,431
What's your deal? Is someone
paying you to ruin my life,

307
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:00,866
or is something clinically wrong with you?

308
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:05,970
Dad, I had to-- Not another word.

309
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,471
What did she do now?

310
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,540
Today's stunt was breaking into school.

311
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,107
To take an English test. Hush.

312
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,875
They were going to give me a zero. I said--

313
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,311
Wait, what? You broke into
school to take a test?

314
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:19,979
I know. It's weird.

315
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:21,680
And it's going to cost you another mark

316
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:24,949
on your permanent record.
So let me get this straight.

317
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:27,451
You're going to punish my daughter
for trying to get a good grade?

318
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,619
Well, I'm sure as hell
not going to reward her

319
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,454
for breaching our costly,
yet apparently crap, security system.

320
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,955
Come on.

321
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,790
If this is the way you treat a good student,

322
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,291
what do you do with the bad ones?

323
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,559
Chain them up to break rocks during recess?

324
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,093
Just because she's a good student

325
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:42,794
doesn't mean she's good.

326
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,096
She's in my office more than
that boy that randomly bites

327
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:48,799
other kids' necks. Damn this vampire craze.

328
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,968
Look, Kat is many things-
Stubborn, intractable,

329
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,803
relentless-- Annoying, trouble-making.

330
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:56,605
Pardon me, Principal Holland,

331
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,174
but if anyone's going to insult my daughter,
it's going to be me.

332
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,175
This girl is a great kid.
She's smart and soulful,

333
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,977
generous and good-hearted.

334
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,112
She's determined to make a difference
in the world, and she will.

335
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:07,448
I'm sure of it.
Yesterday, when she walked out,

336
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:08,749
yes, she broke the rules,

337
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,484
but it was 100% the right thing to do.

338
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,686
She was just defending a poor kid

339
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:16,189
against authority figures who prefer
to scare kids into submission,

340
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,189
rather than inspire them to greatness.

341
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,324
I got the other one.

342
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,527
Man, he's fast. Well, well, well.

343
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:29,430
Here's that poor kid now.
That poor, defenseless kid.

344
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:47,013
Cameron, thanks for erasing the tape.
Consider that your last favor.

345
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:53,289
Look, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I wanted to tell you about Joey,

346
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:57,460
but you weren't speaking to me.
No, I'm sorry.

347
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm sorry I thought you were this sweet,
innocent girl from Ohio,

348
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,833
who thinks about puppies as she falls asleep.

349
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,802
But now I see you're this ruthless vixen

350
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:09,972
who will step on anyone
to get what she wants.

351
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:16,409
In fact, I bet you hate puppies.

352
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:20,345
I love puppies. Not falling for that again.

353
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,151
Hey, B. You want some fro-yo?

354
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,587
I got a huge one because I
feel like celebrating me.

355
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:35,626
Mm, whoever invented sprinkles
deserves a gold star. Mm.

356
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:44,934
Chastity, I have something to tell you.
I'm so glad we've become friends,

357
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:49,104
real friends, which makes
this so much harder to say,

358
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,708
but I have to be honest with you,
no matter what happens.

359
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:56,677
Uh, well, consider the suspense built.

360
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:04,782
I'm the one who kissed Joey.
So that went well.

361
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:07,451
The test grade counts,
the suspension's been lifted,

362
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,788
and Principal Holland admitted
that she didn't have a concussion

363
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:11,123
in front of witnesses.

364
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:12,791
Thanks to you, I'm still
an Ivy League candidate.

365
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:15,459
You're also a liar. What?

366
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,228
This whole time, you've been telling
me this is about your principles.

367
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,463
You forgot to mention your
principles drive a motorcycle.

368
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:23,233
So it was Patrick's bag.
That's not why I left.

369
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:26,269
The school violated several
Constitutional amendments.

370
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:33,542
Dad! Kat!

371
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,144
Just get in the car and drive.

372
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:38,813
What is going on?
Why are you covered in sprinkles?

373
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,248
Just drive.

374
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:45,583
Go, go, go. Chastity is coming.

375
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:48,584
Oh, I will see you at school tomorrow!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
