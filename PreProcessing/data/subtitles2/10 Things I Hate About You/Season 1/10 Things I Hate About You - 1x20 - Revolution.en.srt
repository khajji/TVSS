00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:02,302
<i>Things I Hate About You...</i>

2
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:06,141
You betrayed me.
It's not personal. It's just politics.

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:09,870
<i>I'm on The Biggest Poser.
I leave for New York tomorrow!</i>

4
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:12,623
The only thing the show's
going to change is my address,

5
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:16,245
not the way I feel about you.
I thought we both wanted to do this.

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,369
Just because I want to have sex
doesn't mean I should.

7
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:21,448
We had a huge fight. I think it's over.

8
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,528
I'm glad I caught you
before you left for Nepal.

9
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:28,479
He didn't try to stop me.
Okay, let's review the details

10
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:32,320
of our annual sexy carwash fundraiser.
Are we sexy? Check.

11
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:34,712
Have we bought soap,
sponges, and buckets?

12
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,077
Check. Have we made posters?

13
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:38,411
Yep, Dawn's hard at work
with the glitter gun.

14
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,080
Have we approved Michelle's bikini?

15
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:42,752
I refuse to repeat last
year's wardrobe malfunction.

16
00:00:42,786 --> 00:00:46,257
Approved. We even did a stress test.
You are so efficient

17
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,763
and pleasant to deal with. I am sick of Michelle.

18
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,034
I think it's time for a
new vice head cheerleader,

19
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:56,976
and her name is Bianca Stratford.
Oh, my God, really?

20
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:01,284
That would be a dream come true,
page nine actually, but can you just do that?

21
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,187
Thank God cheerleading
isn't a democracy.

22
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,460
The only opinion that matters is mine.
You are my favorite dictator.

23
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:14,971
Michelle. Chastity. Bianca.
Michelle, Kaitlin.

24
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,174
Bianca, Chastity. Okay, enough.

25
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,145
Well, we should probably
be getting to class.

26
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,414
Okay. See you guys later.
Bye.

27
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:26,687
Bye. Bye.
Did you see that?

28
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:29,157
They stopped talking
the second they saw us.

29
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:34,063
Well, so did we...
because we were talking about them.

30
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:36,265
Oh, my God, do you think they
heard about my promotion?

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,367
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:42,039
They were already planning a coup d'?Â©tat
the moment we walked up.

33
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:45,076
Do they not realize who
they're up against?

34
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:50,249
I am this school's Tony Soprano.
Bianca, oh, we are taking them down.

35
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:51,518
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,628
Hi, I'm Kat Stratford.

37
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,897
I'm a big fan of your university,
huge, actually.

38
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:05,067
Congratulations.
Thanks. Would you like a prospectus?

39
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,236
I've got one already.

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,639
I like to flip through it and daydream,
not in a sad, socially-maladjusted way.

41
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,108
My mom went to Brown,

42
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:12,843
and she always talked about how
much she loved her time there.

43
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:15,146
So you're a legacy.
That improves your chances.

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,515
No favoritism, please. I think I
deserve admission on my own merits.

45
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,986
Sir, William Blankenship.
Allow me to cut to the chase.

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,821
I know at most you'll accept
one student from this school,

47
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:25,691
and I would like to be that student.
No, I would like to be that student.

48
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,361
He would like to push my buttons.
No, I would like to go to Brown.

49
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,930
My mother went there.
Best time of her life.

50
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,431
Does that make me a lecy?

51
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:34,267
We try not to view college
admissions as a competition.

52
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:36,069
Just so you know,
I turned my car into a bio-diesel.

53
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:38,572
I speak fluent Cantonese.
I enacted Meatless Mondays.

54
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:40,874
I'm student body president.
He is not. We haven't even voted yet.

55
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,661
I'm running unopposed.
Not anymore.

57
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,765
<i>Kat.
Can you take down a few of your posters?</i>

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,035
There's not enough room on these
walls for my posters, too.

59
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,736
I know.

60
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:10,407
It's hard when two such important
events are going on at the same time.

61
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,643
Why don't you just cancel your supe
r-offensive sexy carwash?

62
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,479
Because Dad's out of town.

63
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:18,548
This may be my polka dot bikini's
only chance to see the sun.

64
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,718
Don't look now. It's Patrick.
I don't care.

65
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:25,088
I've moved on.
Really, don't look

66
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:28,759
unless you want to see Patrick looking
super buff in his white T-shirt.

67
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:41,038
All right, later.
Hey. Hi.

68
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:42,940
As you can see, I didn't go to Nepal.

69
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,276
Bianca begged me not to.
It was pathetic.

70
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,944
So you're still a fellow inmate, huh?

71
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,747
Yep, but I don't want us
to have to avoid each other

72
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,615
in the prison yard.

73
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,051
Just because we broke up,
doesn't mean we can't be civil.

74
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,488
Don't worry. I won't shank you.

75
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:59,690
Cool.

76
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:04,795
Well, I hope I can count on your vote.
Like I vote in these stupid elections.

77
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:18,802
Michelle and that other girl whose
name I can't remember are planning...

78
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,737
They're planning something, aren't they?

79
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,372
I'm sure they are,
but they know we're friends.

80
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:27,875
Getting any info is
...is going to be impossible.

81
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:32,012
Being a mole is way harder than it looks.
Huh. This isn't brain surgery.

82
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:34,049
We just have to make them
believe that we hate each other.

83
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,886
Ooh-ooh, I have an idea.
We stage a fake fight.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,222
You guys get into a big public brawl
that totally ruptures your friendship.

85
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:43,124
I don't know.
After the fake intervention,

86
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,259
we promised ourselves
no more fake events.

87
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:46,661
They always backfire.

88
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:48,862
That's only because Joey
was such a wild card.

89
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,398
This is an inside job,
so nothing can go wrong.

90
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:53,733
Let's do it this afternoon
at the sexy carwash.

91
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,736
Yes.
I finished the flyers.

92
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,371
It was not easy finding recycled
paper with a nice sheen.

93
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:03,874
And I've worked up some talking points.
It's a little bit of Hilary's smarts

94
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,009
and a little bit of Sarah's "Aw,
shucks" appeal.

95
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:08,745
You guys rock.
Imagine what this place could be like

96
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,413
with smart women like
us making the decision.

97
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,815
Come to my victory toga beach party.

98
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,318
Free food and, fingers crossed,
swim suits optional.

99
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:22,390
Your cover charge: the low-low price
of a vote for Blank.

100
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:25,359
Party!
Party. Party. Party...

101
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>Blank, Blank...</i>

102
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,198
Kat, lovely to see you, as always.

103
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:35,100
You're so afraid of losing to me,
you've resorted to buying votes.

104
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,602
Remember, cheap theatrics
can only take you so far.

105
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:41,105
Just ask Howard Dean.
Now you've hurt my feelings.

106
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,806
You're still invited
to my victory party.

107
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,475
I think you would look
smashing in a toga.

108
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,143
Well, you don't,

109
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:49,545
and I hope your deposit at the
beach club is nonrefundable.

110
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:54,015
Sexy carwash.

111
00:05:55,617 --> 00:06:01,954
Bianca, what do you think you're doing?
I put you on tire duty. Hop to it. Now.

112
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:05,957
These bottoms don't look cute when I
crouch, Chastity, and stop shrieking.

113
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,625
I can hear you.

114
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,628
Oh, you were so much more
obedient when you were the mascot.

115
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,031
Maybe I should demote you.
Now, get back to work.

116
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:18,401
I want to be able to see my
reflection in those hubcaps.

117
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:21,637
No problem. They're the
same height as your face.

118
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,106
No, she didn't.

119
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,375
You better check yourself, Olive Oyl,

120
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,211
and next time,
you should shop for a bikini

121
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:30,913
in juniors.

122
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:35,750
Hey, your ex-boyfriend Joey
thinks my body is perfect.

123
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,619
Oh, how would he know?
It's not like he's ever seen it.

124
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:43,820
She's a virgin.
That's right, folks.

125
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:46,889
She never slept with Mr. Ross.
She made it up

126
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:52,393
so that people would think she's cool.
Dawn.

127
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:54,995
Bianca, I'm sorry. I can't help myself.

128
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,164
Chastity, I told you that
in strictest confidence.

129
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,965
Stay out of it, Kristi Yamaguchi.

130
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:03,102
At least I'm not a slore who slept
with Joey on the third date.

131
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,305
Oh, and F-Y-I, he also said
that you were so bad in bed

132
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,107
that he faked it.

133
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,720
<i>*  Who's gonna bring the
quiet day? * </i>

134
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,389
<i>*  Black and blue,
black and blue * </i>

135

<i>*  You know that you're
gonna lose * </i>

141
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,111
That's it! You're off
the squad for real.

142
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,947
Okay, actually, Chastity,
you were the one who crossed the line.

143
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,583
You threw the first sponge,
and when it comes to violence,

144
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,619
this squad has a zero-tolerance policy.

145
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:03,688
Which means we can kick you
off with a unanimous vote.

146
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:07,158
It was a sponge, not a grenade. Okay?

147
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:09,694
You can't vote me off.
I'm the captain, damn it.

148
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:12,864
Girls, with a show of hands,
how many of you feel threatened?

149
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:24,100
You're out, Chastity. Good-bye.
Yes.

150
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:38,222
Is there a bruise? And a welt.

151
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:43,560
And a red mark in the shape of a sponge.
If it doesn't go away, I'm suing.

152
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:47,062
You totally should.
Maybe you could get her car.

153
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,296
There's Joey.

154
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:52,833
<i>Joey, there's a drought on the
tundra.</i>

155
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,401
<i>You haven't had anything
to eat in "veeks,"</i>

156
00:08:55,436 --> 00:09:00,373
<i>so now you're going to be stalking Mr.
Antelope.</i>

157
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,508
<i>Get up. Got it.</i>

158
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,242
<i>Is it okay if I crawl, you know,
work the floor?</i>

159
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,410
<i>Ya, ya, get down.</i>

160
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,713
<i>Exactly, but remember to
find your light, okay?</i>

161
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:12,080
<i>I want to see "zee" hunger in your
eyes. Okay?</i>

162
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:17,751
<i>Und not so feral.
Lyso "modelicious."</i>

163
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,420
Modelicious.

164
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:25,057
<i>Co'lliviette, you knew I wanted to rock
the peacock.</i>

165
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,626
<i>Sorry, but your face looks more like a
horse, bitch.</i>

166
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,398
<i>Who are you calling a bitch, bitch?
Get out of my face, Zebra.</i>

167
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,837
<i>Co'lliviette, come on.</i>

168
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:37,840
I hate how girls on reality shows
are always so bitchy to each other.

169
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,510
It makes me embarrassed to be a girl.
I know.

170
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:43,079
Until Co'lliviette accused Tia
of stealing her trail mix,

171
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:48,883
they were best friends.
Dawn, be honest with me.

172
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:51,085
Do you think I was a bitch to Chastity?

173
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:54,554
Well, she was a bitch first.

174
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:59,558
Yeah, but we were becoming real friends.

175
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,729
I want to be a better person
than Tia and Co'lliviette.

176
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:07,466
<i>And in conclusion,
allow me to quote Mahatma Gandhi,</i>

177
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,669
who said, "Be the change you
wish to see in the world.

178
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:13,404
If you vote for me, Kat Stratford...

179
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:19,042
I will be that change.
Cut. Okay.

180
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,711
Uh, yeah, that was terrible.

181
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,347
I don't think even I can
vote for you after that.

182
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:27,950
I completely tuned out as soon as you...
I get it. I sucked.

183
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:31,587
You want them to like you. Try smiling.

184
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,623
A smile isn't going to help, Gaia.
It's that speech.

185
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:40,760
It's boring and just pukey--
Hey, I killed myself writing that.

186
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:44,030
It focus-grouped very well with Mr.
Montcastle's homeroom.

187
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,633
Give me this.

188
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:52,672
Okay, now, why don't you just tell me
why you want to run in your own words.

189
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:57,209
I want to be president because--
I don't know.

190
00:10:57,244 --> 00:11:01,480
I want to beat Blank,
and I want to get into Brown,

191
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:06,152
and, well, the truth is
every morning I wake up,

192
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:09,254
and I think,
"Who are these people?

193
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:12,956
Why am I the only person who cares
about anything that matters?"

194
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:15,759
And then every morning I remember,
they're idiots.

195
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:19,396
They have teeny-tiny little pea brains
that can only process information

196
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,399
in the form of a tweet, a ring tone,
or a status update,

197
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,067
and if they're not going
to think for themselves,

198
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:27,170
they need someone like
me to think for them.

199
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:30,173
Yeah, that's not going to work either.

200
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:37,146
Okay, I have an idea,
but before you say no, just hear me out.

201
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,048
How's your sense of rhythm?

202
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,554
<i> *  My name is Kat Strizzy
 I'm from the Midwest *</i>

203
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:51,891
<i>*  Now I'm chillin' up in SoCal  With Padua's best * </i>

204
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:00,069

205
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,205

206
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,013

207
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,682

209
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,888

210
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:26,124
<i>*  Who speaks up for rights Vote Kat for prez * </i>

211
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,193
<i>Peace. I'm out.</i>

212
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,235
Can you believe they threw
out my script and did this?

213
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,071
It's vulgar.
We're so going to win.

214
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,638
No, we won't.

215
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:46,041
This will show the entire school
she hasn't got a stick up her bum

216
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:48,476
right before they vote.
I think you underestimate

217
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,476
just how much people dislike her.
No. It's over.

218
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,308
She's won,
and maybe she deserves to.

219
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:57,306
Keep it together, Blank.
You don't concede that easily

220
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,206
unless you've been caught
in an airport bathroom.

221
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,741
Besides, you promised I'd
be in charge of prom.

222
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,376
Give it a rest, Tabitha.

223
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,683
Hey, guys.

224
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,818
Listen, things got a
little crazy yesterday

225
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:16,486
with the water and the
sponges and the voting.

226
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,554
I think we went too far.

227
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:21,156
Since I'm the one Chastity hit,
and I'm willing to forgive her,

228
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,858
how about we just bring
her back on the squad?

229
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:27,428
Good idea, Bianca.
Second chances are so inspiring.

230
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:30,798
You're kidding, right?
Chastity was really mean.

231
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:34,200
And that's Brittany saying that.
She's so nice it's nauseating.

232
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:39,705
I'll admit Chastity can be a bitch,
but if we punish her for that,

233
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:42,140
then we become bitches, too.
It's this horrible cycle

234
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:43,808
that's often filmed for television.

235
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:46,477
Last week she told me I had the
ankles of a middle-aged man.

236
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,512
Come on, guys, have a little compassion.

237
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:50,614
Look, girls, I'm the
new head cheerleader,

238
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:53,149
and I say it's done.
I'll do you a favor,

239
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,518
and I'll try to forget this
conversation ever happened,

240
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,319
but it'll be tough.

241
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:59,655
If you don't let Chastity
back on the squad,

242
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:05,226
then Dawn and I quit.
Okay, bye.

243
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,761
Bye. Bye.

244
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:10,631
Oh, my God, we just quit cheerleading.

245
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,099
Okay, okay, let's not panic.

246
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,801
They'll never find replacements
for all three of us

247
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:17,371
before the game.
They've got to come crawling back.

248
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:21,438
<i>Right.
My story is America's story.</i>

249
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,640
<i>I believe in America,
and I believe in you,</i>

250
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:27,576
<i>Padua High.
Vote William Blankenship</i>

251
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,711
<i>for Student Council President.</i>

252
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,413
<i>See you at my victory toga beach
party.</i>

253
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:47,358
Thank you for that stirring
tribute to white immigration.

254
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:50,794
And now our final candidate's video,

255
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:54,363
after which you'll return
to your homerooms and vote.

256
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:58,699
Give it up for Kat Stratford.
This ought to be good.

257
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:03,435
Go, Kat.
Yeah. Go, Kat.

258
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,838
<i>The truth is every
morning I wake up</i>

259
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,774
<i>and I think,

267
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:40,364
This is not what we did.
Kat.

268
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,067
Please believe me when I tell you
I had nothing to do with this.

269
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:50,772
Right.
You're welcome.

270
00:15:57,928 --> 00:16:00,063
Kat, wait. I don't
want to talk about it.

271
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:05,000
My poor sister and her big mouth.

272
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,736
Yeah. Well, we got our own problems.

273
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:10,038
Michelle has not begged
us to come back yet.

274
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,906
Trust me. She will.

275
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,674
Just wait until they try
to toss Kaitlin in the air.

276
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,542
Ah, glad I found you two.

277
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,343
Act nonchalant.

278
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:23,414
Michelle, you look so cute.
Thanks. I need your uniforms.

279
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,782
We've got a game Friday,

280
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,784
and the new girls need
to get them fitted, so...

281
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,954
New girls?
Yeah, they're so great.

282
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,389
Way less mouthy. Okay, toodles.

283
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,492
Bica, what are we going to do?

284
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:42,331
If I'm not a cheerleader, then who am I?
There's Chastity. She'll have a plan.

285
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,200
Chastity, look.

286
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:48,536
I know you're upset with me,
but so much has happened

287
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,038
since our sponge fight yesterday.

288
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:52,040
I realized our friendship
means more to me

289
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,309
than a stupid cheerleading uniform,

290
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:57,579
so Dawn and I demanded that
the squad take you back,

291
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:00,982
and when Michelle said no,
we quit in solidarity.

292
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:03,084
Oh, that is so sweet.

293
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:06,449
You're the best friend I've ever had, B,
and you're my sixth best, Dawn,

294
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,485
but I wish you would've
checked with me first.

295
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,786
Why? Look,

296
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,388
the only reason I go to
this crappy public school

297
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:17,358
is because I'm head cheerleader,
so I'm transferring to St. Augustine.

298
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,061
Turns out their head
cheerleader's in rehab,

299
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:23,831
so there's an opening.
But you can't just leave us.

300
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:28,468
I will always be just a text away.
Air hug.

301
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:36,611
I'll miss you besty.
But we just quit for you.

302
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:42,449
You suck!

303
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,146
Looks like you could use a ride home.

304
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,222
All I ever wanted was to be popular,

305
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:33,592
and now I've lost it for
someone who gave me an air hug.

306
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:36,294
I can't believe we're
going to be unpopular.

307
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:38,464
Cameron, what's it like? Is it horrible?

308
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,365
No, there's a bunch of
cool stuff about it.

309
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,268
Really? Like what?
Like, uh, you get lots of free time

310
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,203
to hang out and play
games with your friends,

311
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:51,040
be they virtual or actual people.
Uh-huh. Anything else?

312
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:52,675
Well, your cell phone bill's a lot lower

313
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:54,076
because the virtual
people never call-- Shh.

314
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,680
Okay, that's enough, sweetie.
Dr. Stratford.

315
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:01,349
Daddy, I thought you weren't
coming back until tomorrow.

316
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,684
There's nothing more boring

317
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:04,819
than a bunch of
gynecologists talking shop.

318
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,821
I mean, how many
conversations can you have

319
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,024
about the cervix?
Oh, and the vagina jokes.

320
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,794
Ew, Dad. Gross.
Oh, tell me one.

321
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:17,230
Sorry, forget where I was.
Where's your sister?

322
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,499
She's upstairs.
She had a rough day

323
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:23,671
and could probably use a hug.
Tell you one later.

324
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:29,277
<i>Um, Bianca, you should watch this.
Co'lliviette, are you okay?</i>

325
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:32,312
<i>I'm just thinking about my baby.
You really misher.</i>

326
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,213
<i>Yeah.</i>

327
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:38,183
<i>I love her so much.
I'm just afraid she, you know,</i>

328
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:41,620
<i>wrecked my body.
Seriously, no.</i>

329
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,056
<i>No, you don't look like you had a baby
at all.</i>

330
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,124
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

331
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,393
<i>Look at my stomach.
It's, like, totally flat.</i>

332
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:53,796
<i>No. Touch it. It's cushy.</i>

333
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,466
<i>No, it's not.</i>

334
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,649
Well, that was fun.

335
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,954
This is like a new record for us.
We haven't gotten in one single fight.

336
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:28,891
You see, this is what the world needs
more sex, less war.

337
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,658
Now, if that had been
your campaign slogan,

338
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:31,826
you would've won.

339
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,176
Can I ask you a favor?

340
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:02,614
Don't break my heart. Okay?
Okay.

341
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,456
Can I ask you a favor?
What is it?

342
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:15,600
I hear someone can use a hug.
I'm not leaving.

343
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,120
Series Finale! Hope You liked all My
