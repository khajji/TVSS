1
00:00:01,152 --> 00:00:02,781
And that's 10 points for theatre.

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,822
Do you know that I used the correct British spelling ...

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,749
... and not the bastarized American version.

4
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:09,249
Why must we allways ruin everything?

5
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,990
I think I get my nipples pierced in protest.

6
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,291
Or maybe a sexy back tattoo.

8
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:18,692
Dad, I'm dropping out of school...

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,094
...to become an adult film star.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,134
That's nice, honey.

11
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:25,457
- She's late for curfew
- At least the hounds.

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,510
Do you think, that's funny?
Hounds run my To-Do-List.

13
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:30,010
Dad, relax. She's at a soccer game.

14
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,358
The odds of her beeing kidnapped
 and sold into slavery are very slim.

15
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:34,876
Thanks for bringing that up.

16
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,590
I just were choosing a car accident.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,281
Sorry.

18
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,876
But she's my little flower.

19
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:40,793
If she's your little flower, what am I?

20
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:43,249
You're my big tough cactus!

21
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:45,778
Green, spiny and felid, that's great, Dad.

22
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:49,528
What I mean is -
someone messes with you, you stab him.

23
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,822
Plus, cactuses are never out late
on a school night...

24
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,353
trying to .... 

25
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:56,069
Our correct name is cacti. 

26
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,327
Thank god you're home safe,
so I can kill ya.

27
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,334
Daddy, before you say anything

28
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:05,266
I've would have been on time today...

29
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:07,501
but I had to save a life tonight.

30
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,524
What happened?

31
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,577
After the game we decided to grab something to eat

32
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,123
and .. this guy started chocking

33
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:15,870
and I just shot my eyelash-curler down his throat

34
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:18,679
in order to safe his life.

35
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:21,179
Way to go, McGroover.

36
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,675
Daddy, maybe one day I become a doctor..

37
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:27,221
..so I can save lives like you every day!

38
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:30,186
That's sweet, now blow into this.

39
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:33,755
See ... all clear.

40
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,237
Now, Lady's late, we'll see how long you

41
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:37,236
grounded, when your testresults get back.

42
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:39,403
Cat .. go to your sister, honey

43
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:39,967
you need to make sure

44
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,831
It's her year and I know the drill.

45
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,872
This family is so ... twisted !

46
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:58,503
I need to show you something.

47
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,564
Careful, that's borderline sexual harassment.

48
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,803
How borderline?

49
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:04,284
Crearly I'm not working hard enough.

50
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,575
Same shirts.

51
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:12,334
Wow, two things that match.

52
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,909
Pretty soon you'll be reading.

53
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,746
So you know about the show tonight.

54
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:17,640
Of course.

55
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:19,703
That's strange.

56
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,035
Typically pretty girls are very good liars.

57
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:24,607
There. The club ...

58
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:27,467
..is called Life Fate.

59
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,967
Of course you need a fake ID.

60
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,883
Ahm.

61
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:39,155
And you ... need some manners.

62
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,985
I'm grounded for the entire weekend.
Apparently I'm irresponsible.

63
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,617
Can't you leave the house at all, because..

64
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:57,787
... I was thinking, you and I 

65
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,222
could go for a frozen yoghurt.

67
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,915
Mother Theresa would look shady. 

68
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:07,179
Hey, Bianca.
 I heard, you got busted for staying out late last night.

69
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:09,107
Eow, Avery, check your sources.

70
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,445
My dad is stoned 24/7.

71
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,382
He doesn't care when I come home.

72
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,383
So I'll see you at the swimteam party tonight, right?

73
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:17,693
I'm all over it like mustard.

74
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:22,001
I didn't know your dad was a pothead.

75
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,375
He's not. He's strict, but strict parents...

76
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,273
... are so 2004.

77
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,261
That means we've got a secret.

78
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,173
It also means, I'm screwed.

79
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:31,839
Don't worry, I'll never tell.

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,836
Not unless they tickle me.

81
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,265
No Cameron, I'm screwed, because I didn't
know about that party.

82
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:41,145
- No biggie, happens to me all the time!
- Exactly!

83
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,305
Cameron, I'll now need to tutor you
in the language of popularity.

84
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,183
- Ok.
- Rule # 1: Information is power.

85
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,865
Think of it as a pyramid.

86
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,847
At the top are those
who are invited to the party.

87
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:55,130
People lower them are inviting
people who wanna come...

88
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,133
... but don't know, where the party is.

89
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:59,334
And below them at the very bottom...

91
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,450
ak.a. the blissfully irrelevant.

92
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:07,617
ak.a me.

93
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,614
Not anymore!

94
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:13,368
You just became relevant.

95
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,868
Because we are going to that party.

96
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,975
We? Like the sound of that.

97
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,641
First, we need you to find out,
where the party is.

98
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,003
Why you just don't ask Avery?

99
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:26,141
If I ask someone, where the party is ...

100
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,303
... then I know, I'm on your social level
and ...

101
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,803
... I just can't risk that.

102
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,810
Sorry!

103
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:35,860
Popularitiy is a brutal language.

104
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,360
And they don't even make a .... for it.

105
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,211
But don't worry, I'm a good teacher.

106
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:50,279
Up the zip fellas, ladys in the house.

107
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,702
There's nobody in here.

108
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,698
You supposed to wait in that stall.
I'll guard the door.

109
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,319
Ahhh, gross.

110
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:59,843
Do you know they supposed to pee in the bowl, right?

111
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:02,245
Aagh, so who is this guy again?

112
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,595
No one knows.
He's called The Wizard and he just knows ...

113
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,485
... how to get stuff.

114
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:08,798
I heard, that last year he
got some ? and new kidney.

115
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:10,686
I have a hard time believing.

116
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,237
Okay, what do you want?

117
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,078
A .... fake ID.

118
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:18,064
Sixty bucks and a photo.

119
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,534
Oh, he's like Chris Angel.

120
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,397
Dude, did you seen
Kelly Morris out there today?

121
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:40,931
Can't look at her direction without
streching my speedo.

122
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,896
Well, I guess you're not coming
skinny dipping then to my party.

123
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:45,996
Dude, you dry off the pool here?

124
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:48,496
Think, you should save me.

125
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:07,180
Aquaman, what's your name?

126
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,703
Chip Petterson.

127
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:19,482
Just wanted to see who makes these.

129
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,650
Hmm

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,831
Bianca ... I know where the party is.

131
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:45,301
Oh, where is it?

132
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,559
It's at Chip Petterson's house.
 I hacked into the school studens database...

133
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:49,707
...and found his address.

134
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:52,333
- Ew, like 24.
- Terrorist bad.

135
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:56,332
- I know.
- So I thought maybe we could grab dinner before.

136
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,313
Before I do anything,
I have to get out of beeing grounded...

137
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,231
...which means convincing my father that I am...

138
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,594
...trustworthy, dependable and unlikely
to have sex. 

139
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,203
So much harder, than stopping terrorists.

140
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,535
Ok, you can peek.

141
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,658
Bianca, this looks amazing.

142
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:18,203
Ah, should't we say grace.

143
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:21,197
We haven't said grace,
since you stopped using your Pocahontas-fork.

144
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:23,697
Let us pray.

145
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:28,204
Thank you Lord for this bountiful harvest.

146
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:33,618
And bless the underprivileged
and teenaged children in new highschools.

147
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:36,208
- Amen.
- Ok, Bianca, what gives?

148
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,708
Cat, please.
Ok, Bianca, what gives?

149
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,813
Daddy, I've been thinking about my ? recently.

150
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,573
Ever since I met this
great group of kids at school...

151
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,300
...speaking of which, they invited me
to this killer bible study tonight.

152
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:48,057
- Can I go?

153
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:55,023
And the Oscar goes to...
...Bianca Stratford for lying to her father.

154
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:55,995
Zip it, Satan.

155
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,495
Dad, I really hate to miss it.

156
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,462
I think tonight I get my purity ring.

157
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,017
And I think tonight you'll be
home with the purity security.

158
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,733
Dad, is it ok if I go out?

159
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
There's a foreign film festival
I want to check out.

160
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:11,713
- Well, why should you not?
-That's it?

161
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:14,004
When I go out I have to file the flight plans
with the FAA. 

162
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,003
But she gets to go out
without questions asked?

163
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,833
Gonna drink? - No. - Drugs? - No.
Sex? - Gross.

164
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,427
Satisfied?

165
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,966
(Exhales)

166
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:26,100
You know what, Dad?
I gave up everything I worked
so hard for back in Ohio.

167
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,367
Last year I had 42 pictures in the Year Book...

168
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,243
...as a Freshman, 
thank you very much.

169
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:30,719
Yeah.

170
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,946
Who put pictures of you in a 
stupid yearbook. 

171
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,939
That's not the point.
The point is ...

172
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,586
... I'm worried that no matter
how hard I try...

173
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,499
...I'll never gonna be as 
happy here as I was back home.

174
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,399
What do you really
have going on tonight?

175
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,552
A party.

176
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,168
Plain and simple.
And I'll be home by curfew...

177
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:53,265
...and I volunteer for a full battery of tests, I promise.

179
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,730
Sure, your sister will take you.

180
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,022
- No.
- But Dad.

181
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,262
Cat, please. Just do this one thing for me.

182
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,396
I have plans tonight
and they don't involve carpooling.

183
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,114
Why can't you be on my side for once?

184
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,003
Bianca, calm down. I'll take
you to the party...

185
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:09,150
... and I just wait for you
in the car outside.

186
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,250
Sure, Dad, why don't you
carry me in a Baby-Bjorn?

187
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,040
Forget it.

188
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,418
Ohh, so dramatic.

189
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,956
I know you don't think
I'm on your side, but I am.

190
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:41,759
I mean, we're sisters.

191
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,787
I kinda have to love you.

192
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:48,170
But tonight...as the first time since
we've been here

194
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:58,313
I promise. Your next 'can't miss or die
your social ? party' not only ...

195
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:01,146
will I drive you.
I'll do it without mocking ...

196
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:05,141
C'mon, that was funny, c'mon.

197
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:12,720
Of course, this is why we're not closer.

198
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,728
Are you ready for our first swimteam party?

199
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,840
(Ahm) Actually I was thinking 

200
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,795
this could be considered our first date.

201
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,743
$ 24 plus tip.

202
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,295
I'll give that.

203
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:42,856
I forgot my wallet.

204
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,638
For your sake I hope your girlfriend
has cash.

205
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,175
Do you have any ... Wait, you...

206
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:49,576
-..you thought she could be my girlfriend?

207
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:53,082
Sorry, Cameron, I ? out of the house 
with lip gloss.

208
00:10:57,627 --> 00:10:59,627
What size shoes are those?

209
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,667
This is exciting.

210
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,879
First time allways is
for a party virgin.

211
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,693
Not for long.
Take me ... but please be gentle.

212
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,714
First once a year (???).

213
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:25,291
Oh, crap.

214
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,330
It's been so long,
since I've been popular...

215
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,007
..I forgot about the decoy house.

216
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,580
A decoy house?
Like Operation Fortitude...

217
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:33,779
...where fake Sherman tanks
were used to lore...

218
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,933
...the Germans into believing, that
the invasion of France...

219
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:37,718
...wouldn't take place in Normandy?

220
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:38,904
Yeah ... sure.

221
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,404
That's genius.

222
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:43,848
All that hard work ... for nothing.

223
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:46,099
What a stupid immature mistake.

224
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:48,005
Don't beat yourself up.

225
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,195
I have to leave,
before someone sees me here.

226
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,561
- Sees us.
- No, me.

227
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,775
- It's good for you to be seen here.

228
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,138
Popularitiy is confusing,
but you'll figure it out.

229
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:00,702
We need a ride.

230
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:03,915
My mom is at a Angry-Devorcee-Meeting
tonight.

231
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:04,988
Can you call your sister?

232
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,217
It's a nice night.

233
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:09,343
Let's walk.

234
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:12,558
Ouch, ouch.

235
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,499
Ok, hey no need to get physical.

236
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:51,349
Hey.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

237
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,332
I thought, you were some other guy.

238
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,082
I'm not saying, that you are a guy.

239
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:58,911
You could be a ...butch lesbian...

240
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,636
...or a transgender male.

241
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,158
Whatever you are, I, I celebrate you.

242
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,825
Looking for me?

243
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,748
Yes... if you're the ladys room.

244
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,666
Admit it. You're excited to see me.

245
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,896
Don't flatter yourself. I came for the band.

246
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:28,415
I know every song by heart.

247
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,085
Oh, oh, of course you do.

248
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:33,276
You know, I'm sure to you
their songs are just a ...

249
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:35,297
... groovy soundtrack
for banging chicks...

250
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:37,299
...but their lyrics are poetry.

251
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,930
I know where I am,

252
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,514
it's ? high on a hill,

253
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,550
is we're racing to
canyons of angels.

254
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:47,436
Wow, next time I'm banging chicks,

255
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,456
I have to pay more attention.

256
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,836
Eow, ahh, I think I stepped on
a syringe.

257
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,336
It's just a bottle cap,
it didn't even break the skip.

258
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:05,836
- Let's keep moving.
- Please, don't make me.

259
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,668
We have no other options.

260
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,631
Again, eow, you can 
call your sister.

261
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,633
So she could pick
us up on a high horse?

262
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:13,495
No, thanks.

263
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,305
She propably turn me in,

264
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:16,605
and there would be mocking.

265
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:17,974
She may surprise you.

266
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:18,864
You don't know her.

267
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:21,364
Well, I could meet her,
when she picks us up.

268
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:26,222
Oh no, it's dead.

269
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:27,118
Oh well.

270
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,801
? the chance.

271
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:46,862
Uuh, goodie.

272
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,404
Come on.

273
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,464
You want me to kiss you.

274
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,999
The lead singer, yes.

275
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,389
You, not so much.

276
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,038
You sure about that?

277
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,832
I'm just standing here.

278
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,238
You're the one moving closer.

279
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,827
I've gotta take this.

280
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,847
Maybe it's a sign 
to work on someone else.

281
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,953
You'll better be bleeding.

282
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,403
I need you to pick me up.

283
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,291
I snaked out with my friend Cameron, who

284
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,428
has ridiculously sensitive feet.

285
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,430
I can't. I'm at the filmfestival.

286
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:28,471
Look,

287
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,183
if you do this, I'll raise all 

288
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,185
Kate Hudson movies from the networks queue.

289
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,368
(indistinctly speaking)

290
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,434
Where do you want me to meet you?

291
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,513
So you snook out of the
house to go to a party?

292
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:50,718
But you had the wrong address.

293
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,064
How does humiliation taste?

294
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,511
Like a stupid sore ?.

295
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:55,802
Now, save the commentary
and just drive us home.

296
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,063
My name is Cameron,
by the way.

297
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,782
I Dad finds out about this,
you are gonna spend the ...

298
00:15:58,764 --> 00:16:00,764
rest of highschool sealed
in a plastic bubble.

299
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,168
So I snuck out of the house.

300
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,151
It's common behaviour for a human teenager,

301
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:05,982
which you would know,
if you were one.

302
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,751
Were what?
A human or a teenager?

303
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:08,333
Both.

304
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,488
If we're just gonna sit here,
can you crack a window?

305
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,286
I get carsick.

306
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:12,699
Next time you want me
to drop everything... 

307
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:13,913
...and come pick you up,
remind me...

308
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,248
...how rewarding this is.

309
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,467
Isn't it rewarding enough,
being little Miss Perfect?

310
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,512
First---I'm not perfect.

311
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,136
And second---you know,
how much I hate...

312
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,075
childrens beauty pageants.

313
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,991
I'm so sick of this.
I can't wait, untill I can just drive.

314
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:25,946
Drive?

315
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:26,954
Speaking of driving.

316
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:28,376
Dad will never give you a car.

317
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,164
Maybe you can roll around in that bubble.

318
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:31,637
What's this?

319
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,766
Over 21 is the ... name of
the movie I went.

320
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:38,273
Saw tonight very european
... (?) forefilm of nudity.

322
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:41,866
- That's weird.
- Shut it back, Darth.

323
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,989
I'm not stupid.
You went to a club.

324
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,351
Which means, you have a fake ID.

325
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,450
No, no, no - stop, stop, stop.

326
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:47,408
Get out of there.

327
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:50,775
I'm not sure, what amazes me more.

328
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,803
The fact, that you lied to Dad or
that this ID is so good.

329
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,082
Yeah, you didn't see this.

330
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,842
Oh, but I did.

331
00:16:58,342 --> 00:16:59,899
Dad better get your own
personal bubble, 

332
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:01,693
'cause you're not sharing mine.

333
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,051
Fine!

334
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,844
I won't tell Dad, 
you snuck out...

335
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:12,836
if you don't tell him about this.

336
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:16,671
Deal!

337
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,533
I'm gonna .... ugh.

338
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,033
Ohhh.

339
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:27,337
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:34,527
Ok, I'll keep Dad occupied,
while you sneek back into your room.

341
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:35,527
Be quiet.

342
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,699
Same ? at the rodeo.

343
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,007
Your spray?
What's that do?

344
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,797
- The alcohol brings down the ink.
- Impressive.

345
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,309
What's that do?

346
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:45,913
Nothing ... I

347
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,171
just wanted to spit on you.

348
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,225
Ok, tender moment over.

349
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:01,252
Hey, Dad!
Boy, that movie was long.

350
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,053
Europans should really lern,
how to edit. 

351
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,209
What are you doing?

352
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:05,742
Listening to my policeband radio ... 

353
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:08,192
because your sister snuck out 
and isn't answering her phone.

354
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:10,184
So far she hasn't  been raped or murdered.

355
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,583
?.
These things are amazing.

356
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:13,838
Are you sure she isn't here?

357
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:16,338
Maybe we should check
again in about two minutes.

358
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,094
Na, I locked the window.

359
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,310
The only way she's coming home is
through that front door.

360
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:23,917
Hey, Dad.

361
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:24,686
Hmm?

362
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:25,716
Ralax!

363
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,243
- I, I
- I'm sure, that she is fine.

364
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,175
Why she's putting me through this?

365
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,411
When she comes back,
we're having an exorcism.

366
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,089
Bianca!

367
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:40,763
There she is!

368
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,588
Safe and sound!

369
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:50,190
You're lucky.
Your trial is at 7 a.m.

370
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:52,111
Don't move.
I need to get more specimen cups.

371
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,195
Dad already knew, you snuked out.
There's nothing I could do.

372
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,676
So we both grew up
and I'm the one who gets screwed ...

373
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,256
I don't think so.

374
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,089
Dad, there's something you should know.

375
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:01,754
Not for the mood for excuses, Bianca.

376
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,854
You need to learn to be more
responsible, like your sister.

377
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,379
You mean, my older sister?

378
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:08,676
The one I'm supposed to look up to
and emulate.

379
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,692
The trustworthy daughter.

380
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,491
Would you like to know,
what little Ms. Perfect did tonight?

381
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:15,780
She ...

382
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:18,224
She went to a ...

383
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:23,852
...movie, that featured 
full frontal nudity.

384
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,752
It's not the same as deceiving your father.

385
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:29,218
Fine, give me the cup.

386
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,741
Don't worry, I closed my eyes.

387
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,295
What I'm gonna do about her?

388
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:40,314
How to cut her some slack.

389
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,380
I wouldn't drive her to the party tonight,
so she snuck out.

390
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:44,589
She just wanted to have some fun.

391
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:46,031
Yeah, but you don't wanna have fun.

392
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:51,000
- I have fun sometimes.
- Sure, but you go to filmfestivals and things like that.

393
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,743
Not always.

394
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:56,977
I'm just saying...that's why you my
trustee dependable cactus.

395
00:19:58,635 --> 00:19:59,210
What?

396
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,379
This is my fake ID.

397
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,503
I went and saw a band
playing the club tonight.

398
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,667
Plus, I went alone.

399
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,167
Horrific things could have happened to me.

400
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:20,353
Why you showing me this?

401
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,103
Ahh, because I don't wanna be a cactus.

402
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,838
You're trial's at 7:15.

403
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:45,741
And when I get through with you,
you gonna wish the death-penalty.

404
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:47,434
Bianca?

405
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:48,622
Yes?

406
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,626
Make sure, it's your sisters urin.

407
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,138
Good night, all.

408
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:54,431
Good night, Dad.

409
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,493
Showed Dad my fake ID.

410
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,525
Are we even now?

411
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,543
Not until you give me one.

412
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:15,273
