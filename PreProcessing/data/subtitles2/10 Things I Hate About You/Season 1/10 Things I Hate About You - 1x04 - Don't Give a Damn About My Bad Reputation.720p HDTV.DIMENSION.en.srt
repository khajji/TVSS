1
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:04,288
So, after waiting five hours
for Joey's aunt...

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:06,481
to get hooched up enough
to pass out...

3
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:09,550
we had full access to
her infinity pool and hot tub.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:13,407
Of course, we forgot our swimsuits,
but that didn't stop us.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,351
And that's how
they invented tangelos.

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,642
Uh, Chastity,
I was out sick last week.

7
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,543
Are "tangelos", like,
a slang word for something?

8
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:28,836
Sorry, ladies, but this story is NC-17.
I can't serve it to minors.

9
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:34,360
Just because I'm from Ohio doesn't mean
I'm some naive little farm girl.

10
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:36,777
My neighborhood was pretty sketch.

11
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:41,875
You wouldn't believe the number of prostitutes
we had hanging around our cul-de-sac.

12
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,595
Oh, that is so cute!

13
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:51,398
You brought a little kitty
for naptime?

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,224
- It's my lucky charm.
- Oh.

15
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,805
Okay, you got me.
I use it to smuggle heroin.

16
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:15,115
- Honey, something wrong?
- I'm in the middle of a major crisis.

17
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:18,364
Chastity thinks I'm a goody-goody,
which means soon the whole school will.

18
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,856
That is a major crises.
It ranks right up there with the...

19
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:23,543
global recession and the collapse
of the arctic shelf.

20
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:26,965
Let's turn on the radio,
see if Bono wrote a song about you.

21
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:30,270
Sarcasm never helps.
You should be proud of yourself, Bianca.

22
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,895
A good reputation can take you places
in politics and business, in this house.

23
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:36,899
Dad, we're in California now,
home to medical marijuana...

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,377
the Kardashians, the pantyless crotch flash.
Good girls don't sit at the popular table.

25
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,185
Maybe it wouldn't bother you so much
if your self-esteem wasn't based on...

26
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:47,685
- what other people think.
- See, that's why you have no social life.

27
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:50,975
I need to change my image.
I've narrowed it down to getting a lip stud...

28
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:54,952
dying my hair pink or...
dressing like a pussycat doll.

29
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,498
No face piercing,
no alternative hair colors.

30
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:00,869
- No pu-- What's a pussycat doll?
- They're multihyphenates-- Strippers who sing.

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,776
Why not tell people you're a groupie?

32
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:06,032
Or one of those white house interns?
Or some idiot...

33
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:09,291
who gives birth to a baby at the prom,
and they didn't even know they were pregnant?

34
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:11,576
That is a genius idea, dad.
Thanks!

35
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:14,230
I can tell everyone
I had a baby!

36
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,905
Way to go, grandpa.

37
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:20,231
Oh, she's gonna hate
those pretend stretch marks.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,668
Funny.

39
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:27,428
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

40
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,625
Did you watch dateline last night?

41
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:38,879
I can't believe they haven't
run out of predators.

42
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,801
You missed.

43
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,612
He's not gonna pick that up.

44
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,942
Don't mess with him.
He'll kill you, literally.

45
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:53,884
- That's what he wants you to think.
- Kat, he comes from a long line of criminals.

46
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:56,651
I heard his dad's in prison
for skinning a man alive.

47
00:02:56,652 --> 00:03:00,648
Okay, well, his gene pool gives him
an excuse to kill... not litter.

48
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:03,776
Be careful.
His mom's a Mexican drug lord.

49
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,076
Pick it up.

50
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:11,662
Ohh.
Do you have trouble hearing?

51
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,681
Real mature.

52
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,812
I just like watching you bend over.

53
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:32,489
Oh, that's nothing.
You should watch me do this.

54
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,964
Now you know how the earth feels.

55
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:44,460
It's called peacocking, bro.
All the celebrity dudes are doing it.

56
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,916
Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake...

57
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,355
even that Mormon guy
on the real world.

58
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:52,633
I don't know. It feels weird
drawing attention to my neck.

59
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:55,336
You're never gonna get Bianca
in your Bill Gates wardrobe...

60
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:57,775
without the mad scrilla
to back it up.

61
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:01,287
Okay. But are you sure
it doesn't make me look like a...

62
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:02,632
choreographer?

63
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,482
Oh, you look great.

64
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,262
I have a big fat favor to ask.

65
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:12,134
Ooh. I don't respond to "fat".
Mmm.

66
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:14,646
Okay, a small skinny favor then.

67
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:17,431
Can I lie and say I'm at
your house after school?

68
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:20,382
- If it's for a good reason.
- Well, I'm dating this older guy...

69
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:22,519
and my dad would freak
if he found out.

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,828
How much older is "older"?

71
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:27,744
26. Or maybe 31.
It's hard to tell.

72
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:31,091
He feels weird about the age
difference. It's adorable.

73
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,130
Wow.

74
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:35,603
The oldest guy I've ever been with
was my camp counselor.

75
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:38,892
I know what you're gonna say.
"Bianca, this can't go anywhere."

76
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,566
And you're right.

77
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:44,557
But he's so hot, and when he blows
on my neck, I...

78
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:48,713
I... I've already said too much.
Promise you won't tell?

79
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:52,808
Oh, come on, Bianca.
You can totally trust me.

80
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:59,329
- Hey, Bianca.
- Hey, Cameron, gotta run.

81
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,413
Nice scarf.
Talk later.

82
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:05,078
This peacock needs more feathers.

83
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,273
Tell me what happened.

84
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,068
He littered.

85
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,583
Which apparently triggered
some sort of psychotic break.

86
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:18,526
Right- right. Because I'm a woman.
I'm emotionally unstable.

87
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,841
Way to stereotype.

88
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:22,209
Mr. Verona, since you
love trash so much...

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,510
you can spend the afternoon
in detention picking it up.

90
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:26,717
- But she's the one who--
- Don't try and pin it on her.

91
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:30,425
Whatever happened is obviously
your fault. It always is.

92
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,750
- You're kidding me, right?
- I don't kid...

93
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:37,294
between the hours
of 8:00 and 3:00.

94
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,959
Bu-bye.

95
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,196
Oh. hey,
he forgot his backpack.

96
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,783
You can go.

97
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,602
Unless you want to help me
hire a new lunch lady.

98
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:55,111
Why they wear their hairnets
to these interviews I'll never understand.

99
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,603
Don't you think that
that was a little harsh?

100
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:02,642
You don't even know what happened.
What about innocent until proven guilty?

101
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:05,345
Are you representing him now,
Mr. Dershowitz?

102
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:08,287
Patrick Verona has spent
more time in this office than I have.

103
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:09,336
For what?

104
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,742
Here.
Let me get his file for you.

105
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:14,939
Oh, wait a minute. It says here
it's none of your business.

106
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,703
Okay, here's the thing.

107
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:20,234
He did litter, repeatedly,
and I think he enjoyed it...

108
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,796
but I may have overreacted
a little when I...

109
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:26,387
kicked the trash can over on him.

110
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:30,933
- It's very noble of you to confess.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,963
- So he doesn't have detention?
- No. You have it with him.

112
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,961
But I suggest
you keep your distance.

113
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:41,952
Have you ever
poked a monkey in a cage?

114
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,390
You poke him enough times,
he'll bite you back.

115
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:50,299
Yeah.
He'll bite back.

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,231
Bianca...

117
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,478
if I were to buy a book about a girl
named Bianca and an older guy...

118
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,961
where would I find it?
Fiction or nonfiction?

119
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:14,698
Oh, definitely nonfiction.

120
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,224
So it's not true.

121
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,821
Oh, no, it's true.

122
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:25,057
Oh, cool. Dating older dudes
is a textbook supermodel maneuver.

123
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,341
Give me some.
Pishhh!

124
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,570
- Mr. Ross? Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,694
Who invented geometry?

126
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:46,270
Um, I-- I say it was Pythagoras,
but, uh, Belinda says Euclid.

127
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,710
Uh, well, Euclid was known
as the father of geometry...

128
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:53,380
though, technically, he didn't invent it.
He just wrote it all down.

129
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:56,876
- I knew you'd know.
- You know everything.

130
00:07:56,962 --> 00:08:01,931
Uh, well, not everything.
But most things, yeah.

131
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:06,698
Okay. Uh, Bianca, you mind sticking
around, going over your test?

132
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,870
Oh, was it my ink choice?
I like working in fuchsia.

133
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,184
It relaxes me.

134
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:14,477
You skipped an entire page
of the test.

135
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,024
I'm assuming you don't hate
isosceles triangles?

136
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:22,448
"Hate" is a strong word.
I'd prefer to call our relationship rocky.

137
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:42,208
I can't believe it. She is totally
having an affair with Mr. Ross!

138
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,815
- I'm so jealous.
- I hate her.

139
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,238
I can't believe she's making me
return Patrick's bag.

140
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,973
- Let him get his own Sherpa.
- It's not ticking.

141
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,533
Good, 'cause my bomb-defusing
skills are a little rusty.

142
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:54,098
Oh, I'm so tempted to just
toss this in the dumpster.

143
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,697
- First let's look through it.
- That's an invasion of privacy.

144
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:58,804
How would you like somebody
to look through your stuff?

145
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,917
- I don't care. You wanna look in my bag?
- Not really.

146
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:04,509
- Oh, no. It's coming undone.
- Come on. Don't. This is not cool.

147
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,140
Kat, it would be irresponsible
not to open it.

148
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,856
What if there's
a murder weapon in here?

149
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,719
What's in there?

150
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,307
It's just as I thought.

151
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,918
Before he kills, he uses a lighter
to burn off his fingerprints...

152
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,291
then he uses those gloves
to strangle people...

153
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,028
and the clippers to cut off
souvenir body parts.

154
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,553
Ah. What's the antacid for, Sherlock?

155
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:34,681
Maybe what he does is so horrifically
vicious even he gets nauseous.

156
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:38,427
Trust me, Patrick Verona
wishes he was that dangerous.

157
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:40,778
Reality is never as juicy the rumor.

158
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:45,869
No way! Mr. Ross is not having
an affair. That's crazy.

159
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,225
Who told you this?

160
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:53,822
Hi, everybody.

161
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,620
- What's going on?
- Um, you're welcome.

162
00:09:57,621 --> 00:10:01,611
- Thank you so much for...
- Totally covering for you and Mr. Ross...

163
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:04,324
which means you owe me
the juicy details.

164
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:07,367
Wait. You think Mr. Ross
is my older guy?

165
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:09,479
It's not him.
Why would you think that?

166
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,498
I know what I saw.
I have to say...

167
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,580
you holding out on me
hurts my heart a little, Bianca.

168
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:19,073
I thought that we were slowly building
that bridge of friendship brick by brick.

169
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:23,272
- But now I worry that it may be crumbling.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

170
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:27,009
The bridge is still very much intact.
Remember, bricks are strong and sturdy.

171
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,241
They're the only thing
you can't huff and puff down.

172
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, secrets can cause erosion.

173
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:36,079
Okay, you got me.
It is Mr. Ross.

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,524
But now you really, really can't tell anyone.
I wouldn't want him to get into trouble.

175
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,200
Oh, I would never.
Now dish.

176
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,625
Can't stay away, can you?

177
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:57,377
Did you take a peek?

178
00:10:57,378 --> 00:11:01,729
Ooh, I was going to, but my
hazmat suit is at the cleaners.

179
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,005
Okay, fine.
It's not Mr. Ross.

180
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,907
But if it were Mr. Ross,
how did it start?

181
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:20,288
It's not Mr. Ross.

182
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,611
Well...

183
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,559
I was at that store in the mall-- The one
with the creepy mannequins with no hands--

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,187
And I was trying on these pink
skinny-legged jeans...

185
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:32,461
and I came out of the dressing room,
and Mr. Jones was there.

186
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:35,434
And he was all, "wow".

187
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,772
Wow!

188
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,742
Bianca hasn't even
looked over here yet.

189
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,796
And I know it's working,
because everyone else is staring.

190
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:46,498
Are you sure girls like
seeing a guy's nipple imprints?

191
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:50,720
I think your nipples are too young
and baby smooth to attract Bianca.

192
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:54,422
So, what are we talking? Piercing?
'Cause I don't know if my mom will let me.

193
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,626
Look, I'm not talking about
your style, bro.

194
00:11:56,627 --> 00:12:00,570
I'm talking about your girl.
She's not who you think she is.

195
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:05,656
Bianca's hooking up with Mr. Ross.
- What? No way.

196
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:08,203
She would never do that.
I know Bianca.

197
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:12,959
She's a sweet, decent person,
like, uh, Taylor Swift.

198
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:17,090
<i>Bianca Stratford, please report
to the principal's office.</i>

199
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:22,102
Ooohhh!

200
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:32,800
I think I finally figured you out.

201
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:36,525
You dump trash on me, you go out
of your way to get detention...

202
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:39,361
steal my backpack.
You're obsessed with me.

203
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:40,501
Mmm.

204
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,492
What can I say?
You nailed it.

205
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:48,788
You and me in these sexy vests
picking up trash...

206
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:51,191
the sweet stench
of garbage in the air.

207
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,567
Welcome to my dream date.

208
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:58,622
- Am I making you nervous?
- So nervous.

209
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,849
Ooh. How much
would you pay me to eat this?

210
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,627
- You want a bite?
- Gross!

211
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,071
Aahh!

212
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,853
No wonder you have acid reflux.

213
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:13,461
You did look in my bag.

214
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:14,949
What?

215
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,216
Come on. Just cop to it.
You couldn't resist.

216
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:21,751
Seriously, it's okay if you're
obsessed with me. Just admit it.

217
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:24,899
No.
I did not look in your bag.

218
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,772
Ow!

219
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,418
Thank you.

220
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,135
Sorry, Bianca.

221
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm just trying to protect you
from yourself.

222
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,452
I mean, it's not like
you were born a slut.

223
00:13:45,753 --> 00:13:48,807
Bianca, this is Darlene Tharp,
the school shrink...

224
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:52,921
we have to have here by law.
She's gonna ask you a few questions.

225
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:53,672
Okay.

226
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:56,574
Hey.

227
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,958
- Is this okay?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,186
Okay. Just know
that I am here to listen...

229
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:06,996
with open ears, open heart
and open mind.

230
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:10,884
It is just the two of us
against the world. Okay?

231
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:12,384
Bianca...

232
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:16,093
please tell us the nature
of your relationship with Mr. Ross.

233
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:20,222
It's just your normal, run-of-the-mill
student/teacher variety.

234
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:25,209
Bianca, sweetie,
this is a safe place, okay?

235
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:28,714
Think of me as your cool aunt
or your B.F.F.

236
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,553
Or all those ladies
from the view rolled into one.

237
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,642
- Oh, Lord.
- Okay, Bianca...

238
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:37,538
can you show me, on the doll,
where Mr. Ross touched you?

239
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,773
Bianca, are you having
an affair with Liam, or not?

240
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:44,875
- Liam? Who's Liam?
- Liam Ross.

241
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:48,793
No, absolutely not!
I've never had an affair with anybody.

242
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:54,995
Listen, I'm very aware
that Mr. Ross is an attractive--

243
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:59,960
Extremely attractive,
funny, sexy man...

244
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:02,748
with really nice hands.

245
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,454
But you don't have to protect him.

246
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:10,331
Because he is the enemy.
You can destroy him.

247
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,593
Would you like to hurt Mr. Ross?

248
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,911
Come on. Go ahead.
You can rip his head off.

249
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:17,760
Miss Tharp, I swear,
nothing happened.

250
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:21,552
It was just a story.
I made it up.

251
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,500
Listen, I know you don't want
to betray your lover.

252
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,442
That's understandable.

253
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:29,424
But if this is true,
he needs to go to jail...

254
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:32,979
no matter how
good-looking he is.

255
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:35,972
This is going to sound
really stupid...

256
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,693
but I was just pretending
to be a bad girl.

257
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,833
I'm actually a goody-goody.

258
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,593
I don't own a thong,
I floss every day...

259
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:48,800
and sometimes when I cross the street,
I still like to hold my daddy's hand.

260
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:51,476
And I have a lucky cat.

261
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:57,156
Poor Mr. Doodles.

262
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:01,543
All right. Thank you, Bianca.
We'll take it from here.

263
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,921
Stop.

264
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:08,272
That's how we got
into this mess. Just...

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,307
- Let me see it.
- It's fine. I just lost half a toenail.

266
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,772
Let me see.

267
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:26,487
You can go.

268
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,141
No. No, no, no.
I'm not gonna go.

269
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:31,717
Because you're obsessed with me.

270
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,673
His time of the month.

271
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:43,078
Mr. Verona.

272
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,442
- Where is it?
- What?

273
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:56,283
I can't believe you would take it.

274
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,686
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't take anything.

275
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:02,705
Oh, sure you didn't. Just like
you didn't look through my bag!

276
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,071
Patrick!

277
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,904
Cameron, I need your help.
I'm in so much trouble.

278
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,830
Yeah, I know all about that.
You and Mr. Ross.

279
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,094
I didn't think you were capable
of something so unsavory.

280
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:22,192
Cameron, you know me. What's the one thing
I want more than anything else in the world?

281
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,360
Beyonce to perform
at your sweet 16.

282
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:25,761
In the real world.

283
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,769
Oh.
To be popular.

284
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:31,453
So this morning, I made up this rumor
about me dating an older guy...

285
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:33,574
and then that older guy
turned into Mr. Ross.

286
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:37,479
And now, because of a stupid lie,
a really hot teacher's life could be ruined.

287
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,810
It's the most horrible thing
I've ever done.

288
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:43,372
- This is great news.
- Why is it great, exactly?

289
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:48,650
Because this will be
a valuable life lesson...

290
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:51,584
that will help calibrate
your moral compass.

291
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,851
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But, Cameron, what should I do?

292
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,127
You've gotta warn Mr. Ross.

293
00:17:57,926 --> 00:18:00,470
Oh, my God!
Mr. Ross!

294
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:05,222
Mr. Ross, it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

295
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:08,025
Is this about the test?
Because I gave you an A-minus.

296
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:11,645
You guys have to let him go.
He's an innocent man. I can prove it.

297
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:12,621
Liam!

298
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,345
You cheated on me with her?

299
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,485
No! No!

300
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:20,208
Rot in jail, scumbag!

301
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,590
Ewww!

302
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:26,803
It isn't true, Sophia!
You're the only one I ever loved!

303
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:29,639
Sophia! Sophia!

304
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,553
Mr. Ross, you...

305
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,352
two-timing jerk face!

306
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,759
So something
fell out of his bag.

307
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,390
Any clue what it might be?
Breath spray? A yo-yo?

308
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:56,272
- Maybe a finger?
- I don't know.

309
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:59,712
It was hard to understand anything
he said after he Christian baled on me.

310
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:03,515
But if I don't find whatever the hell it is,
he's gonna think I kept it on purpose.

311
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:06,675
Then he busts out the gloves
and strangles you.

312
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:10,030
Oh.
People in this school are sick!

313
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,385
I'm going in.

314
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,453
Think this it?

315
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,110
Hey-hey, come- come on.
Give a girl some air.

316
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:41,680
I mean, can't you see
that she is in a lot of pain?

317
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,952
So what was the hottest thing
that you and Mr. R ever did?

318
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,703
'Cause Joey-- he's really
into role-playing.

319
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:52,211
Well, this one time, he asked me
to stay after class and I did...

320
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:55,062
and he pulled up
this chair-desk and...

321
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:56,374
Cameron!

322
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:59,440
Uh, sorry. I really need
to talk to him.

323
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:01,600
To be continued.

324
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:04,415
- God, that was so intense.
- I know.

325
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:06,573
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:10,822
Thanks for being there for me.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

327
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,828
I'm so lucky to have met you.
You're my first G.B.F.

328
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,847
- What-- a G.B.F.?
- "Gay Best Friend."

329
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,054
See you tomorrow.

330
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,074
She was just kidding.
She was just kidding.

331
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,724
It's nothing.

332
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:57,217
Kat, can we get out of here?
I just wanna go home...

333
00:20:57,218 --> 00:21:01,095
and watch crazy people on reality TV
so I can feel normal again.

334
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:13,971
Let's go!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
