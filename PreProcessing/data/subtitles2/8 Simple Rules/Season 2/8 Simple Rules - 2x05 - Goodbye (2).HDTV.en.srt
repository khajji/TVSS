1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,586
Previously on 8 simple rules.
- Yeah, this is Mrs. Hennessy.

2
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:13,372
Mom?

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:18,096
My my keys! Where are my keys!
- Mom? - Oh my god!

4
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,490
This wasn't supposed to happen, Mom.

5
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:24,608
Not now.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,680
Not at forty-six.

7
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:31,398
He was supposed to be
back in ten minutes.

8
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,807
He was running a stupid errand.
He was supposed to be back.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,810
And he was taking us to school.

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,561
#8 SIMPLE RULES#

11
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,749
It was a day I’ll never forget.
It was just me and the 'Splendid Splinter.'

12
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:47,729
I drove him around the entire base.
- Wow.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,719
Hand me those pliers, son.

14
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,233
Hey, what happened to the mitt there?

15
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:56,412
Did you punch something?
- No.

16
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:59,017
I burned it on a casserole dish.

17
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:01,094
Okay.

18
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:06,394
Did you know the bathroom is
the most important room in the house?

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,406
It is. It's the only place a man
can find complete solitude.

20
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:14,856
What about women?
- Pssh women.

21
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,838
Women just don't get it.

22
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:18,829
Oh, they go in and they do their, well,

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,796
you know bathroom stuff, but
us men, it's our sanctuary.

24
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:27,695
Now the women,
they’re more communal.

25
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,277
They go to the bathroom together.

26
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,007
Do you believe that?
Together.

27
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,687
You know, us men, we’re solitary beasts.

28
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,869
Yeah, we like our alone time.

29
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,396
And we sure
as heck wouldn’t pick this wallpaper.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,902
Actually this kinda
was my dad's real office.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,140
If he had a deadline
he'd be in here for hours.

32
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:57,349
Every once in awhile, Mom would knock on
the door to make sure he ‘didn't fall in.

33
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:00,174
You see, your dad got it.

34
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:04,554
Yeah, it used to be a
man's home was his castle,

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,528
and slowly women just took
it away and took it away

36
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,931
and we’re down to this one little room.

37
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:16,872
Well, it's all yours now.

38
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,624
Yeah?
- Yeah, certainly.

39
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,905
It only stands to reason.

40
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,769
I'm kinda mad at him, Gramps.

41
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:28,919
Yeah, I know. I know, Rory.
It's okay.

42
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,506
It’s a lot to try to make sense of.

43
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:40,169
Hand me those
needle-nose pliers.

44
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,115
Hey, guys oh, that’s so sweet.

45
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:58,324
Um, can I just change in here.

46
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:05,617
Mom, Fred Doyle is planning on having
dinner with Dad and Jesus in heaven?

47
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:09,083
Come on.
It's a nice thought.

48
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,438
Yeah, but Dad spent three years
avoiding the Doyles' family barbecue.

49
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,491
How's he gonna get out of that one?

50
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:18,221
I mean, Dad's a terrible liar and Jesus
is gonna be sitting like, right there.

51
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:20,789
Yeah, and Fred going
on about the differences

52
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,342
between electric and gas
powered weed whackers.

53
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:28,671
Like Jesus isn't gonna wanna
back out of that dinner.

54
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,877
I'm so proud of you guys.

55
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,725
I can’t imagine going through a
day like this without you kids.

56
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:45,339
Maybe if Dad had looked in the
drawer and saw the batteries

57
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,251
he wouldn't have gone
to the store and then.

58
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:50,556
Kerry, Care Bear,

59
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:55,261
don't drive yourself crazy
going over and over everything.

60
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:58,684
No one can control what happened.

61
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,536
God, Mom, you are so strong.

62
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,443
Oh, no, trust me I fall
apart when nobody’s looking.

63
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,789
The last words I said
to Dad was ‘I hate you.

64
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,102
Oh, honey.

65
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,232
He wouldn't let me borrow his
stupid car and I said, ‘I hate you.'

66
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,709
I had my Dad, and the last words
I ever said to him were 'I hate you.

67
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,230
Oh, baby, I think those were the
first words you said to him also.

68
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,276
It's okay.

69
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:36,181
He knew how much you
loved him no question.

70
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,443
My last words were an insult, too.

71
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,647
He was wearing his Michigan
sweatshirt with chinos,

72
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:46,999
and I said there weren't enough queer
eyes in all of San Francisco to help him.

73
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:53,481
Well, I sent him to the store for milk.

74
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:57,682
So, the last thing he heard out of me
was ‘blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.'

75
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,906
You know what
his last words were to me?

76
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:05,754
What?
'Hasta la vista, baby.'

77
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,787
Such a cornball.

78
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:11,537
You know, he would say anything.
He didn’t care how silly he was.

79
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,554
He just wanted to make us laugh.

80
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:17,716
I am really gonna miss that.

81
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,991
So, somebody’s gonna have to
take up the cornball slack around here.

82
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,841
I vote Rory.

83
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:31,427
You know what
I'm gonna miss about Dad?

84
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:35,548
Those bogus pancakes he used to make.

85
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,948
God, it was like eating Tupperware
covers. - They were so awful.

86
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,640
Pancake mix and water,
how do you mess that up?

87
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:45,565
Well, if they’re so
terrible why’d you eat them?

88
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,537
Same reason you did.

89
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:51,236
It made him happy.

90
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,371
You hear that, Dad?
Our secret's out.

91
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:02,680
I never ate the pancakes.

92
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:07,048
Oh, come here, honies, Come here.

93
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,684
Oh, I love you.

94
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,837
I love you.

95
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:34,057
Gramps?
- Yeah?

96
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,082
What was your dad like?

97
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:42,187
Well, my dad, well, you’re
great-granddad, was a businessman.

98
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:45,832
He owned a haberdashery.
- Habi what?

99
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,338
A men’s store.
He sold suits and hats.

100
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:51,819
Baseball hats?
- No.

101
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,532
No, not baseball hats.
Bowlers, fedoras, derbies.

102
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,921
You know, beautiful hats that
you tipped at young ladies

103
00:06:57,922 --> 00:07:01,662
and wore over your heart when
they played the National Anthem.

104
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,168
Yeah hats were the
cornerstone of civilization.

105
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:09,095
Only savages didn't wear hats.

106
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,843
Were you close with your dad?

107
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,777
Eh, it was a different time.

108
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,412
My dad wasn't always a a happy man.

109
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:21,019
They said it was because of his job.
It didn't fit.

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,654
A man’s job has to fit his spirit.

111
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:27,752
Now, your dad's job was
a perfect fit for his spirit.

112
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:32,154
I don't know, he was always
so mad when he was writing.

113
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:35,044
Rory, do you know what I do now?

114
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:39,189
Gram says eat, sleep and drink
and drive without your glasses.

115
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,679
You gotta love her.

116
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,452
Rory, I build birdhouses.

117
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:48,506
And while I'm building them I'm banging
my knuckles, and cutting my hands

118
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,485
and cussing, and throwing things.

119
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,643
Then about a month later some
beautiful finch or waxwing moves in

120
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:57,085
and I don't give a second thought
to all the cuts and scrapes.

121
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,280
That was my process.

122
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,260
The same with your dad.

123
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,748
It's what he had to do
to get to the good stuff.

124
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,071
You know, had to bang
his knuckles and whatnot.

125
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,769
It’s what you’re doing right now.

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,123
I'm not following you.

127
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:22,327
Well, you’re upset
with your dad for dying.

128
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:26,477
And it's okay to slam
a door, or you know,

129
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:29,918
cry, and get angry,

130
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:33,082
burn your hand on a casserole.

131
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:36,914
That's your process.

132
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:40,101
Do you know anything about plastering?

133
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,442
Well, I know a little.
Why?

134
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:52,286
Yeah, I think we can handle that.

135
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:56,550
Rory, did your dad ever
tell you that he loved you?

136
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,776
Yeah, tons.
- And did you tell him?

137
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,008
Yeah.
All the time.

138
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:07,198
Well, the closest my dad and I ever
came was when I returned from Korea.

139
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:10,578
You know, when I met Ted Williams.

140
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,806
He said he missed me.

141
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,862
What'd you say?
- I said I missed him, too.

142
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:22,928
And then we shook hands
from about three feet away.

143
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:28,228
I think we both felt you know,
the same way about the love stuff.

144
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,802
But it sure would’ve been nice if
one of us just said it out loud.

145
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:40,834
Gramps?
- Yeah.

146
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:43,469
How are you with broken lamps?

147
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:46,920
No.

148
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:49,446
Hmm.

149
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,613
Your father never missed
a deadline in his life.

150
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:59,284
Okay, it’s gonna be really hard.

151
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:03,378
Let's just, uh, let’s go in there,
find your dad's column and get out.

152
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,818
Come on.

153
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,851
Oh my God. I drew this.
It’s my giraffe.

154
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,513
Dad kept it.
- Oh, honey, he kept all your artwork.

155
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:24,879
Uh, you know, I think
'giraffe' is spelled wrong.

156
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,476
I was three! And by the
way, it is spelled right.

157
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:34,939
I can't believe he kept this.
- What is it?

158
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:37,639
It was from when we were in Indian
Chiefs together like ten years ago.

159
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:39,950
Well, of course he kept it.

160
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:42,237
I didn't make it.
He did.

161
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,313
What is it?
Is it an ashtray?

162
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,127
I think it’s supposed
to be a pencil holder.

163
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:52,676
Wow! Bridget's
report card from the third grade.

164
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:56,784
You can tell by all the 'C's.
- Wait! Let me see.

165
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:59,252
Oh my gosh, it so is.

166
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:01,263
And they’re 'C pluses.'

167
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:03,494
Look, my first 'B.'

168
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,425
I can't believe Dad
didn't throw this out.

169
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,583
Maybe he wanted something from
when you were at your academic peak?

170
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,519
Shut up.

171
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:15,685
Oh my God. I don’t believe this.
That idiot. - What is it?

172
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:20,986
These are all these pictures that I
made him throw out because I looked bad.

173
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,145
He kept ‘em.

174
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:28,195
Oh he even took this
one out of the trash and taped it together.

175
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:38,712
You know, I'm not
saying I don’t believe,

176
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:41,387
I'm just saying it’s
awfully hard to feel close

177
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:43,579
to a God that would
do something like this.

178
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,676
I just keep feeling like a
terrible mistake has been made.

179
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:52,996
I just hope you don't take it personal.

180
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,417
Be patient.

181
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,981
Don’t leave now.

182
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,105
I just already feel so damn alone.

183
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,984
I'm not sorry I said 'damn.

184
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,311
Well, it’s all cleaned up downstairs.

185
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:11,689
Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

186
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,367
Oh, I thought I heard

187
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,656
absolutely nothing.

188
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:23,002
So, you're gonna sleep here tonight, huh?
That’s a big move for you.

189
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,573
Well, I keep putting off my
first night in here alone.

190
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,233
I can't do it forever.

191
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,849
It’s so weird.

192
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:37,142
It always felt so small in here with the
both of us banging around in the morning.

193
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:40,667
Now it just feels so big.

194
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:43,882
Well, why, why don’t I just
sit here at the end of the bed

195
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,951
until you fall asleep like I
used to do when you were little.

196
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,748
I won't say a word.

197
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:53,095
I'll just, I’ll just sit there.
- No, it's okay, Mom.

198
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:56,015
It’s okay.

199
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,551
I love you, Mom.

200
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,441
I love you, Cate.

201
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,517
So, I’ll you know,
just sleep on the couch.

202
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,724
Okay.
You know, don't, don’t worry about me.

203
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:19,813
I’ll be fine.

204
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,151
Oh, hi, Dad. - I just changed
the bulb in the hall. It was out.

205
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,144
Unless you want it completely dark.

206
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,414
Oh no no, thanks.
Thank you.

207
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,538
Damn near killed myself.

208
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,794
Do you wanna come in?
- Yeah, sure.

209
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:54,191
Oh, come on.
Just sit down.

210
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:07,884
Dad?
What?

211
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,492
Well, I, uh I think I
found Paul's last article.

212
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,478
Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,666
And you all laughed at me when I said
I took a computer course at the Rec.

214
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,019
Center.

215
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:23,202
I don't wanna toot my own
horn but... - Dad, the article.

216
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:27,114
Oh, yeah, well I found
it in the 'Recycling Bin.'

217
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,582
I don’t think he
thought it was very good.

218
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,348
We spent five hours at that desk.

219
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,679
Well, it's kinda like
cleaning out an attic.

220
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:37,418
If you just did the work,
you'd be out in thirty minutes.

221
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:40,361
It's it’s the memories
that slow you down.

222
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,073
Oh, Dad, why did this happen?

223
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,365
We don't deserve this.

224
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,771
That's 'cause we live under the
impression that we get what we deserve.

225
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:54,598
If I got what I deserved, I’d never
have you and your sister in my life.

226
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,608
Oh, Dad! - No, seriously. What have I
ever done to deserve two such angels?

227
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:03,214
Or Rory?
Or Kerry, Bridget?

228
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:05,812
And, for part of my life, your mother.

229
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,806
Yeah, we just gotta be thankful for
the time we have left with people.

230
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:15,003
And always let them know how you feel.

231
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,517
Sounds like somebody's
been going to church?

232
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,540
Don't tell your mother.

233
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,504
It's our little secret.

234
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,997
I love you, Cate.

235
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:29,803
I'm just sorry I don't say it enough.

236
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,809
And yet I know it.

237
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,670
‘Night.
- ‘Night, Dad.

238
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:59,828
Oh, Paul God forbid you
should move something and look.

239
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,473
Mom?

240
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:08,349
Oh, hi, Beach.
Are you okay?

241
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,250
Yeah.

242
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:12,985
No, not really.

243
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:17,449
Can I sleep with you?
- Oh, come on.

244
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,827
Come here.

245
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:28,267
Oh, come on.

246
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,278
Come on.

247
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,410
Well, I’ve
got something, you guys.

248
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,973
What is that?
- It was dad's last article.

249
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:42,971
Grandpa found it. - Oh my God,
mom, read it. Yeah, read it.

250
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:45,106
Yeah, okay, well, I'm going to.

251
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:49,437
It doesn't have a title or
anything, so, so I'll just start.

252
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:54,136
"Okay readers, today
we're having a little pop quiz.

253
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,203
It's multiple choice.

254
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:59,698
So, sharpen your number two pencils
and put on your thinking caps.

255
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:03,932
Ready, here's a quote,
'Dad, you're an idiot.

256
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,190
Now contestants, this was said to me because
of which of the following transgressions:

257
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:13,183
A) Coming to the breakfast table
wearing pajamas and black socks?

258
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,530
B) Asking my oldest daughter
if that guy I saw her

259
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:19,679
talking to at school
yesterday was her boyfriend?

260
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:24,720
C) Referring to rapper
'Fitty Cent' as 'Fifty cents'?

261
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,205
Or D) Entering the room?

262
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:31,150
Okay, pencils down.

263
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,343
Actually it was a trick question.

264
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,511
The answer is all of the above.

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,047
Now, do you know how many times
I called my father an idiot?

266
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,603
Zero.
Why?

267
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:45,649
Because I feared him.

268
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:48,710
Back then we didn't share
our deep personal feelings.

269
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:53,159
Our deepest conversations usually
revolved around the Tigers' bullpen.

270
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:57,505
But my kids, I can't
get them to shut up!

271
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,433
There’s not a feeling that my kids are

272
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,414
afraid to express,
over and over and over.

273
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:07,185
And my wife reassures me this is a

274
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,003
good thing, over and over and over.

275
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,374
And she's always right.

276
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:17,232
So, do I wish that my kids feared me?

277
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,281
Well, my house would be quieter

278
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:22,915
and I'd spend a lot less
time in the bathroom, but no.

279
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,112
Because I know that
whenever they insult me,

280
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,331
whether it's a 'You're
an idiot,' 'What a geek,'

281
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:36,845
or an 'I hate you,' an 'I
love you' isn't far behind.

282
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:41,643
And it's the knowledge that
my wife and kids love me

283
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:46,589
that makes it safe for me to wear pajamas
and black socks to the breakfast table.

284
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,187
Oh my God.

285
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:55,146
Dad, thank you.

286
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:58,120
That's all he wrote.

287
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,026
That was enough.
- Yeah.

288
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,502
Now I wish we insulted him more.

289
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,891
Okay, guys, it's bedtime.

290
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,421
Alright, move over.

291
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:50,629
Rory, move over.
- I'm over as far as I can get.

292
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,605
Rory, when was the last
time you cut your toenails?

293
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,258
Probably the last time
you shaved your legs.

294
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,852
Mom, you're laughing. Why?
- Oh, God only knows.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
