1
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:05,112
I am so glad I don't dress to be
popular anymore. I am so over that stupid

2
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:08,826
high school stuff. And by the way,
that shirt, very five minutes ago.

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,692
Well, if anyone knows what’s
very five minutes ago, it's you.

4
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:14,115
Please, the only reason you're popular
is because I went out with Kyle,

5
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,620
which made him popular. And then I
dumped him and you got him on the rebound

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,273
which made you popular. Then I had a
deep relationship with Donny Doyle...

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,960
probably the most meaningful two
weeks of my entire life totally

8
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:25,245
taking me out of the loop, creating
a popularity vacuum and voila.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,048
What's that supposed to mean? - I'm not
sure. It's French. But magicians do it, too.

10
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,302
Bridget, I am not popular
just because you let me be!

11
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:35,887
Oh, God, I've seen this
delusion building for weeks.

12
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:41,267
I'm sorry. I was just walking down the
hall and thought I heard a chick fight.

13
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:43,436
Leave! - Get lost! - Okay.

14
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,028
I guess now isn't a good time to
tell you who's on ‘high school scandal

15
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:49,813
dot com's’ new hot list. - Ranking
girls by how hot they are is insulting,

16
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,693
demeaning and mean spirited. - Yeah,
yeah, yeah… am I back on the list?

17
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,444
No. Kerry, on the other
hand, is number seven.

18
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,080
Already? Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

19
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:03,142
That makes you happy?
- No. That makes me hot!

20
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,138
Who the hell's number six? - Hurry
up, kids. You'll be late for school!

21
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:09,915
I made waffles.

22
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,461
I thought you made waffles.
- Well, if I told you it was cereal,

23
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,941
you'd still be upstairs goofing off.

24
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:24,050
Your Dad will be home
with the milk in a minute.

25
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,706
I’ll get it. Come on, girls. Let’s go.

26
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:33,704
Hello? Yeah, this is Mrs. Hennessy.

27
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,963
God, you are so jealous. - Please… I
debuted at number two on the Hot List.

28
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:40,828
Yeah, but she didn't have to do the
things you did to get on it. - Rory!

29
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,440
Mom!

30
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,082
Mom?

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,577
My… my keys! Where are my keys! - Mom?

32
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,324
Oh my god! - Mom? Mom?

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,202
No, I…

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,799
Well, if the monsignor wants to speak,

35
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:13,622
that’s fine, but, listen...

36
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:18,209
no, just, could you please just

37
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,526
do what it is that’s done, okay?

38
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,719
Please?

39
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,596
Thank you.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,791
Rory! - There's no milk.

41
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:27,266
Where's your sister?
- She won't come down.

42
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:32,753
Okay, I should go
talk to her. I’m gonna…

43
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,315
Rory, will you please not
keep your shoes on the stairs.

44
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,802
Those are Dad's.

45
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:43,432
Okay.

46
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,802
That’s gonna be your grandma.
- I'll get it.

47
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,927
Honey, go put
a pot of coffee on, okay?

48
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:53,079
Go on. - Honey! Honey!

49
00:03:56,161 --> 00:04:00,548
Mom! - Sweetie. My sweetie.

50
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,893
I know. I know.

51
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:09,534
My baby girl. Baby.

52
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,973
Honey. - Dad.

53
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:15,689
Catie... Catie, I'm
so sorry, sweetheart.

54
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:19,482
He was such a good man, a
good husband, a good father.

55
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,290
He was. He was.

56
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:28,385
So, Daddy, did you, did you guys,
come on the same flight together?

57
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:31,674
Yep. - Well, I would have thought...

58
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:36,109
Honey, we're your parents first. - And
bitterly divorced couple, second. - Dad.

59
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,359
We are not divorced.
We're separated.

60
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,352
All I know is I'm washing my own clothes
and making my own bed once a week.

61
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,383
You know your sister would
have come if she could.

62
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:47,316
I know. She called from Nepal.

63
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,764
Nepal. Your sister.

64
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:54,095
Honey, Kerry, go get Bridget.

65
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,674
She should be around
her family right now.

66
00:04:57,124 --> 00:05:00,334
So, I, can I get you something Dad?

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,382
I just made a pot of coffee. You want…
- I'd love some. Yeah. - Okay.

68
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,113
Cate, Cate, let me get it.
Come on, now. Come on.

69
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:09,580
You sit down. Can I get you something?

70
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:14,645
Yeah. Yesterday would be nice.

71
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,647
Bridge? - What?

72
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,475
Gramm and Gramps are here.
- Is Dad with them?

73
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:39,895
No. - Then I really don't give a damn.

74
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,789
He was supposed to be
back in ten minutes.

75
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,484
He was running a stupid errand.
He was supposed to be back.

76
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,999
And he was taking us to school.

77
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,070
Remember when we were little.

78
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:58,787
Mom and Dad used to go out
and we wouldn't want them to,

79
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,522
and they’d say, 'What do you
know about Mommies and Daddies?

80
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,799
And we would say,
They always come back.

81
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,416
Unless they collapse in aisle
three of the stupid grocery store.

82
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:19,617
Yeah.

83
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,840
I just… I just can't believe this.

84
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,626
Have you spoken with
anyone from the church?

85
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:29,657
Yeah, Mom. Father
Fitzpatrick stopped by.

86
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,566
You know, I've always taken
great comfort from the church.

87
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,239
Yes, I know. But right now, God and
I aren't exactly on speaking terms.

88
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,424
Well, he'll be there for
you when you're ready.

89
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:45,490
Do you have any of those blue and pink
packets they use now instead of sugar?

90
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:48,370
Sure… yes. You know, I do,
Dad. Go. Rory, go get him…

91
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,471
Can't you just use
the regular sugar? - No.

92
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:53,982
Blood sugar's a little high so I’m
just cutting down on the sweets.

93
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:57,234
You had a chocolate chip cookie on
the plane. - I'm not a fanatic about it.

94
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,408
I'm just cutting down. - 8You see?

95
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:01,973
That’s why I tell you to carry
the packets when you’re out.

96
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:05,023
Ma, could we just not talk about
artificial sweeteners right now?

97
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,563
I’m sorry, dear. - No, I'll just drink
it plain. Rory... Rory, forget it.

98
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:12,227
No, no, no, no, Dad. Rory, go
ahead and get them. It’s gonna be…

99
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:16,796
No, no… I’ll drink it plain. It’s okay.
- For the love of God, I will get it.

100
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:23,822
So, I remember he was looking for his
keys, and I was looking for my backpack.

101
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,463
Then I remembered I left it upstairs, which
is really weird because I never do that.

102
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,563
But, you were downstairs.
Did he say anything?

103
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:35,668
What do you mean?
- Well, before he left.

104
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,034
I mean, you were talking to him.
What were you talking about?

105
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,909
I don't know. - How
could you not remember?

106
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:43,831
Kerry! Stop! Would you just stop it!

107
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to figure it all out.

108
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:55,832
I'm sorry. God, this is so messed up.

109
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:46,744
He was a great man.
- Yes, he was.

110
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:51,197
I really loved him.
- He loved you too, Fred.

111
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:56,940
Fred, there's my mom. I really
have to go and check on my mom.

112
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,644
Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - That
was a beautiful service.

113
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,138
Nice casket. Mahogany,
right? ‘Cause I love mahogany.

114
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,951
Reminds me of a pub I used
to go to… huge mahogany bar.

115
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:14,821
Come to think of it, they used
to carry me out of there, too.

116
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:21,972
Look it, I loved your dad.
He was a better man than me.

117
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,849
I know what you're thinking, 'Who isn't?

118
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:31,059
And you're right. He was the
finest person I’d ever met.

119
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,537
Why the hell couldn’t I open with that?

120
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,399
No. Not again. - Cate! - What?

121
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:54,161
Oh god. - He was a...
- A great man?

122
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,544
He was. - Yes.

123
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:01,457
You know, Catie, I’ve got
this, fantasy dinner for

124
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:04,258
the people I’m gonna dine
with my first night in heaven.

125
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:08,473
Really? - Yeah. You see,
my parents are one and two.

126
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,344
Then there’s, Jesus. But he’s as much a
political choice as any if you get my drift.

127
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:16,897
Then there’s Joe DiMaggio and
Mother Theresa, but, you know,

128
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,869
since Paul’s passing, Mother
Theresa’s getting the boot.

129
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,737
Fred, thank you. - Yeah.

130
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:29,609
Do you believe in heaven? - ‘God’ heaven or
‘sitting here on the couch with you’ heaven?

131
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:35,021
Wow. That was really sweet…
coming from you.

132
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:39,610
Either way, ‘God’ heaven or ‘sitting

133
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,423
here with you’ heaven… Poppa H is here.

134
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,155
That was sweet, too.

135
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,479
Kyle, thank you.

136
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,585
I swear sometimes I
can feel him here, too.

137
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:04,837
Why'd you move away?

138
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,068
Well, if he is here I don't want him
to go all poltergeist on me later.

139
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,292
And the streak stops at two.

140
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,073
Hey, have you eaten anything?

141
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:22,071
No. - You? - No.

142
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,785
Not in the mood for gooky,
red and yellow stuff.

143
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,519
Man, now you got me hungry.

144
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:36,203
Hey. You okay? What
happened to your hand?

145
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:40,785
Nothing, I, burned it
on a casserole dish.

146
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,878
Thanks for the hug, Ror.

147
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:47,051
To think, three days ago, this would
have been considered a chokehold.

148
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:53,029
He was just a... just
a great, great guy.

149
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,881
And one of those writers
whose columns always

150
00:11:56,107 --> 00:12:00,360
made me laugh intentionally
or unintentionally.

151
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,856
He was one of the best.

152
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,477
He had this
funny nickname for me.

153
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:09,974
Yes, right….

154
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:12,914
Nick 'Not-So-Sharpe.

155
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,207
No, it wasn’t that.

156
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:18,636
Anyway, everyone down at the paper had

157
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,374
immense respect for Paul and his work.

158
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:26,155
I was hoping to one day move
him back to sports, fire Tommy.

159
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,709
Hey, boss. - Hey, buddy.

160
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,968
Anyway, we'd like to do a
special supplement of some

161
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,590
of Paul's best columns,
working up to his last.

162
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,367
Nick, he would have loved that.

163
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:42,036
The problem is, we don't have the last
column. He worked out of the house.

164
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,022
So... - Well, it must be here. I’m…

165
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,337
I will…

166
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:55,430
When you get the chance
if you’ll… - Yeah. I…

167
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:58,022
if it’s not too much trouble,
if you could e-mail us the column.

168
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:01,372
When you're ready. I think
it’d would be a fitting tribute.

169
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,640
Okay. - Thanks, Cate. - Thanks, Nick.

170
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:14,167
Okay. I have four daughters I could
never in a million years work at home.

171
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:19,005
Paul said he didn't know how he did it.
He just knew why.

172
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:22,907
He loved being with his family.

173
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,335
Thanks for saying that, Nick.

174
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,827
If you ever need anything.
- Okay.

175
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,877
Hey, Bridget.

176
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:50,275
I'm so sorry.

177
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,344
Thanks. - You know, deep down...

178
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:59,041
I always really liked you.

179
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,229
Deep down, I liked you too.

180
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,173
Wow! Who knew they
even had a 'deep down?

181
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:16,128
Your dad was… so cool.

182
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,747
You guys were so close.
I was so jealous.

183
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:24,628
You had the best relationship.

184
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:28,405
Really?

185
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:31,057
Then how come the last thing
I said to him was, 'I hate you.

186
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,915
There.

187
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:49,960
I talked to that nice
Father Fitzpatrick today.

188
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:52,399
Mom, I asked you not to.

189
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,675
Well, what was I supposed to do? He
called. He asked how you were doing.

190
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:57,994
I said, Not so good.
That's all. - 'He' called?

191
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,741
Yeah.
- Well, actually he was returning my call,

192
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:07,318
but I thought Father Fitzpatrick
could explain… - Really?

193
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:11,128
An explanation. Great. And
that’ll just make everything okay.

194
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:17,243
Catie. Catie, honey…I
talked to Paul's boss.

195
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,045
Great guy. He wanted me to remind you to
see if you could find Paul’s last column.

196
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,481
Well, Dad, I'm just not
ready to go through his desk.

197
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:32,163
Well, let me do it. I just took a computer
course at the Senior Citizen's Rec. Center.

198
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:35,647
I don't wanna toot my own horn… - Jim?
Can't you see this is not the time?

199
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:39,538
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know
that professional obligations

200
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,102
aren't nearly as important
as freezing leftover crap.

201
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,308
Mom. Dad.
- Well, I will tell you what’s important.

202
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,227
What’s important is for Cate to heal.
And with God's good…

203
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,476
Here comes the holy-roller. - I am
sorry that I spend my Sundays

204
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,498
in church while you spend
yours saltwater fishing.

205
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,522
Well, that’s not true.
Sometimes, I play golf.

206
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,997
Do you guys even hear yourselves?
- This is unbelievable.

207
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,445
Jim, we're not helping her at all.

208
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,951
I know. I'm sorry.

209
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:15,199
So, you admit you’re wrong.

210
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,647
You know, the last time we were in here

211
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,662
together, he accused
me of hiding his socks.

212
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:22,878
No kissing, or sweet
talk, no lovemaking.

213
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:28,280
'Where'd you hide my socks, Cate?

214
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,376
That’s a lovely picture.

215
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,599
You both look so wonderful.

216
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,578
It's no wonder I have such
beautiful grandchildren.

217
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:44,114
There’s a lot of Paul in all of them.

218
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:49,033
This wasn't supposed to happen, Mom.

219
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:51,331
Not now.

220
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:54,317
When we were old and
grey and living someplace

221
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:59,704
warm someplace where you eat dinner
at four-thirty in the afternoon

222
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,897
and drive all the way home
with your left directional on.

223
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,245
Not now. Not at forty-six.

224
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:13,061
Well, it's all part of God's plan.

225
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:16,453
I swear to God. I swear.
If people don’t stop

226
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:20,140
saying that to me, I'm
gonna scream! God's plan?

227
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,538
What about my plan?
What about our plans?

228
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:30,311
This picture was a promise.
And now that promise is broken.

229
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,541
What's God's plan for my kids? For me?

230
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:43,344
It's just so unfair.
- Honey, nobody said life was fair.

231
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,327
Oh, God, I know that.
I know that life isn't fair.

232
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,591
But nobody told me it
was gonna be this cruel.

233
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:56,241
Mom? - Hi, baby. Hi.

234
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,124
You okay? - Yeah.

235
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,509
You?

236
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:10,183
You just go get some sleep.

237
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,471
I can't sleep.

238
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:14,642
And Gramps says the toilet
downstairs won't stop running.

239
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,712
So… I'm gonna help him
fix it and let him tell

240
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,824
me about the time he met
Ted Williams in Korea.

241
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,031
Again.

242
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,374
That's really nice, honey. - Night.

243
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:39,849
If you need any more blankets,
mom, they’re in the cupboard.

244
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:43,622
You know, honey, I really don't feel
right about sleeping in your bed.

245
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,059
You really should sleep here.

246
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,917
I can't, Mom.

247
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,395
I can't even be in this room.

248
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:56,215
I don't think I can ever
come in this room again.

249
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,410
On the next “Eight Simple Rules”

250
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,133
I can’t imagine going through a
day like this without you kids.

251
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:06,655
Maybe if Dad had looked
in the drawer and saw all

252
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,912
the batteries, he wouldn’t
have gone to the store. - Kerry!

253
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:13,185
Don’t drive yourself crazy
going over and over everything.

254
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:16,433
The last words I said
to Dad was, ‘I hate you.

255
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,406
He wouldn’t let me borrow the
stupid car and I said, ‘I hate you.

256
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,483
I’m kinda mad at him, Gramps.

257
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,992
Yeah, I know. I know, Rory. It’s okay.

258
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:32,884
It’s a whole lot to
try to make sense of.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
