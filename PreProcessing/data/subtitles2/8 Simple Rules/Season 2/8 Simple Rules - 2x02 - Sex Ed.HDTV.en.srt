1
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:03,794
Look at all of themakeup Bridget
bought. Can you believe it?

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,413
Look… fourteen dollars
for whatever this is.

3
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:08,697
Eyelash curler.

4
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,765
And thank heavens
she got more lip junk.

5
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:13,227
Lip gloss.

6
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,228
Rory, there's a ball game
on channel seven. Watch it.

7
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,340
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Care Bear, look at this, this…

8
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:22,556
You know, not now, Dad. I have
to get ready for my date with Kyle.

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,853
Wait, that's your stuff?
- I can't believe it's already so late.

10
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,874
I still have to straighten
my hair, crimp my eyelashes,

11
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,839
create cheekbones out
of practically nothing

12
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:31,957
which is totally your fault… flat faced.

13
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:37,245
Flat… flat… I do not
have a flat face. Come on.

14
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,541
Well, anyone looks flat in a toaster.

15
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:47,756
Look Kerry, I’ve got to tell
you something in all seriousness,

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,653
ever since you started
dating Kyle you've changed.

17
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,364
You're different. You're more...
- More Bridgetty.

18
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,693
Rory! You’re more Bridgetesque.

19
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,336
You know, how could you
compare me to Bridget?

20
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,337
Where’s my new sparkle lip gloss.

21
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:03,323
Okay, I know I bought
new sparkle lip gloss.

22
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:05,301
Oh my God, where’s my
new sparkle lip gloss?

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,281
Is this it?
- He touched it all over.

24
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:14,806
I miss the old Kerry. - The depressed
one without a boyfriend?

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,755
Yeah.

26
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,996
Why do bad things always happen to me?

27
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:23,816
Bridget, nothing bad
ever happens to you.

28
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,265
Yeah. But today, I heard
Mom is gonna teach sex ed.

29
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:30,301
In my class.
- It's true.

30
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:33,653
Dad, why do bad things
happen to superficial people? - Rory!

31
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:36,815
Rory, I don't know but I know why
bad things happen to smart alecks.

32
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:42,061
'Smart aleck'? You know,
words hurt, Dad. Flat face.

33
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,090
So, what, you're teaching sex education?

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,119
The school needed a nurse to fill in
because Miss Callahan got the 'flu.'

35
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:55,420
Really? I heard she got knocked up.

36
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:58,795
So you just say ‘yes’ without
even totally considering

37
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,859
how it could completely ruin my life?

38
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,926
Bridget I think it's an honor your mother
is going to teach you sexual education.

39
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:06,012
After all, she taught me.

40
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:14,124
Do you guys not understand
what situation I'm in here?

41
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:16,188
I mean, Donny Doyle’s coming
in this weekend to see me. - So?

42
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,544
So, people already perceive my
dating Donny as a slap in the face,

43
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,525
I mean, you know he's older, he goes to
the Naval Academy instead of a school,

44
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:22,600
and then Danielle's going to this
party this weekend, and she's all

45
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:24,858
'You better be there' and I'm, 'Yeah' but
Donny's, 'No, I don't wanna share you,'

46
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:27,363
which is actually very sweet,
but that’s just the sort of thing

47
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:29,942
Danielle’s gonna use against
me, and then you have to go

48
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,623
and exacerbate the whole thing
by teaching sex ed at my school.

49
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:39,727
On the bright side, she
did say 'exacerbate.'

50
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,849
Yeah, honey, I think you're blowing
this whole thing out of proportion.

51
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:46,432
You wanna weigh in here, Paul?

52
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:52,048
Look, it's just two classes.

53
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:55,845
And I will try very hard not to draw
attention to the fact that I'm your mom.

54
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:01,066
And that's how Bridget was born.

55
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,185
#8 SIMPLE RULES FOR DATING
MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER#

56
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:32,572
This movie sounds good. 'High
octane butt kicking from start to finish.'

57
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:37,694
Far be it from me to disagree with Jeff
Paisley from the Shreveport Town Crier.

58
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:42,329
But I really wanted to see...

59
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:45,623
It means, 'Love is the
water of the heart.'

60
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,869
That doesn't sound as
full of high octane.

61
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:53,300
Come on, Kyle. It’s made by this really
amazing avant garde French director.

62
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:58,162
He uses silence in a way that
it almost becomes a character.

63
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:02,474
This guy? He uses his
butt cheeks to talk.

64
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,981
We can't even agree on a movie.

65
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,278
Sometimes I feel like we
have nothing in common.

66
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:11,381
Yeah. I know what you mean.

67
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:14,788
Wanna make out?
- Sure.

68
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,488
Whoa… hey, Lord
of the Manor present.

69
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:19,619
We weren't doing anything..
- Oh my god, Dad do you have to...

70
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,610
Walk in on you and your boyfriend?
Yes.

71
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:23,637
Do I have to call that
your 'boyfriend'? Yes.

72
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:26,338
Do I have to torture
you with a dance like…

73
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:29,662
instead of leaving you alone? No…

74
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:33,753
but you did call me a
flat face. You still here?

75
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:37,354
No. - Thank you.
- Call me later.

76
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,480
So, Care Bear, I hear you’re interested
in seeing that new French movie.

77
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,759
How long were you standing there?
- Don't worry, I had a chair.

78
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:48,288
Listen, I was thinking, you know what
might be fun is if, we sort of saw

79
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,028
that movie together tonight. Sort of
a father daughter foreign film night.

80
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,993
I'd rather stay home.

81
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:56,611
Good. Hey Kerry, we’re going to have a
father daughter stay at home dance night.

82
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:01,009
Yeah… get your groove on.

83
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:03,835
Okay, okay… we'll go to the
movie! Just stop doing that!

84
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,978
Works every time.

85
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,130
Hey, Cate.
- Oh, hi honey.

86
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,993
Kerry and I are going to see a foreign
film tonight. - That's so nice.

87
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:14,141
You know we're not
sitting together, right?

88
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:16,230
I'm excited, too!

89
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,203
Okay, Mom. I parked the car.

90
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:22,636
It's all snug in its spot in the garage
just like how Dad's sperm snugly parked

91
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,515
itself into your egg when you
decided to have sex and ruin my life.

92
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,049
I came up with a little
car analogy for the class.

93
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,565
Cute. What do you mean ‘little’ car?

94
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,805
It was the worst day of my entire life.

95
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,043
Worse than the time you wore a
black skirt and a black top to school

96
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,067
and you didn't notice they
were two different blacks

97
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,050
till you got home and I showed you?

98
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,559
That's it, Rory! We're canceling Bravo.

99
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:45,649
You said you wouldn't
embarrass me, Mom.

100
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,664
You said no one would
know you were my mother.

101
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:51,389
I know honey and I was trying
so hard not to, it just blurted out.

102
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:53,492
You could have stopped
at how I was conceived.

103
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,488
You didn't have to tell them where.

104
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,673
You don't even like the
beach! God, this is so unfair!

105
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:01,653
Did she say penis? - I am never
showing my face at that school again.

106
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:05,643
Penis and vagina?
- Rory, we don't say those words.

107
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:08,668
Why not?
- I don't know.

108
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:13,155
Did you have a rough day today?
- No it wasn't that bad.

109
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:15,830
But I found out tomorrow I have
to talk about contraception,

110
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:19,330
and the only thing the school
will let me discuss is abstinence.

111
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:23,021
Finally, our tax
dollars put to good use.

112
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,914
I don't know, I think it’s irresponsible
to say abstinence is the only option.

113
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,307
I see teenagers at the hospital every
day and they're in trouble already.

114
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,381
They need to know about safe sex.

115
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:35,952
Or, you could teach
them that sex is bad.

116
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,349
That if they have it they’ll
go blind or go to hell.

117
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,568
You're the teacher. You decide.

118
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:39,185
Hi, guys. How was the movie?

119
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:41,224
Fine.

120
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:45,024
Did something happen?

121
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:49,550
There was this scene, this
scene was so incredibly...

122
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:54,540
European.

123
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,532
Hot sex?
- Rory!

124
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,137
Sorry. Did I crack your code?

125
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,975
So what did you do?
- Nothing.

126
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:08,839
You did nothing? - Yes, I did nothing.
What else could I do?

127
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:10,859
Well, you could have left.

128
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:13,104
Oh, yeah. I never thought of that.

129
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,577
I’ll go talk to her.
It’s okay.

130
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:23,151
Wow, you saw the water
bottle scene with Kerry?

131
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,808
You know about the water bottle scene?

132
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,063
Oh yeah. The water
bottle scene’s famous.

133
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:33,911
All my friends are downloading it
off the Internet. Not me, though.

134
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,842
Because I'm not old enough
to see that kind of thing.

135
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,868
And it's illegal.
And it objectifies women.

136
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:45,309
Wait a minute, all your little friends
are watching that scene from that movie?

137
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:50,284
The water bottle scene is like my
generation's Pam Anderson/Tommy Lee tape.

138
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,475
Which of course, I have not seen either.

139
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:57,123
But, maybe you should
take Kerry to see it.

140
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,250
Well, it’s getting late.
- Yes, it is.

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,578
How do you say goodnight?

142
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,286
And your mom's the teacher.

143
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,927
I'll call you next week.

144
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:17,290
Will you? Well, thanks so much.

145
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:20,432
I had loads of fun.
- So did I.

146
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:23,059
Goodnight, Woody.
- Goodnight, Anne.

147
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,020
And thus Woody leaves,
knowing with great pride

148
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,530
that this is another
night he did not have sex.

149
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,613
Okay. So, that's abstinence.

150
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:39,957
Clearly it's been around forever.

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,594
Yo, Ms. Henn, that movie was
all rated 'G' and what not.

152
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,492
Nah, it was less than
'G,' it was like... 'F.'

153
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:50,194
Yeah, Woody's got no game.

154
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:53,227
Look, if you have something
to say, please raise your hand.

155
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,778
Anthony. - Yeah, dawg be cold saying
hasta to a lady with such a fine,

156
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,700
cup sitting booty like that.

157
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,715
But I'll bet my money that dawg
be walking all swishy swishy,

158
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,808
playing for the other team and
what not, you know what I'm saying?

159
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,411
We all have certain urges.

160
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:13,698
Hey Bridget, your mom just
said ‘urges.’ - Kill me.

161
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:18,622
And if you respect yourself,
you will shut down those urges.

162
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,304
She totally said it again.

163
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:25,200
And then, when you’ve finally
made a commitment to get married,

164
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,535
and you finally satisfy those urges...

165
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,290
Stop saying ‘urges!’

166
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,556
There are other words.

167
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,903
It will be all that much
sweeter because you waited.

168
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,917
Waited?
Dang, this sucks!

169
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,507
She's trying to turn us
into a bunch of Woodys.

170
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,908
All right, kids. Okay. I could get
in big trouble for telling you this,

171
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:55,452
but there are
alternatives to abstinence.

172
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,345
What are some of those
alternatives, Bridget's mom?

173
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,702
Well, Jenna, rather than
speak in generalities,

174
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:04,914
why don’t we just answer
some of those questions

175
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,686
you submitted to Miss
Callahan last week?

176
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:11,591
Let’s see.

177
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:14,789
'I have a much older boyfriend
who lives in Maryland.

178
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:20,235
He's coming to visit me this weekend
and I'm feeling pressure to have sex.

179
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,860
What should I do?

180
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:27,754
And I think you should
know, I'm really gorgeous.'

181
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,650
Well, I’ll tell what you should do.

182
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,934
ABSTINENCE

183
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,153
Abstinence! Abstinence.
You hear me, missy?!

184
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,417
Whoever you are.

185
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:48,938
Paul, how many times you
gonna read that thing?

186
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,036
The words aren't gonna change.

187
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,065
Donny Doyle is coming over to our
house to have sex with our daughter.

188
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:58,605
Oh, he's gonna be having sex all right,
but it's not gonna be with our daughter.

189
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,075
What does that mean?
- I don't know.

190
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,580
You just gave me this ten minutes
ago. I'm still formulating a plan.

191
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:07,663
I'm just so disappointed with myself.

192
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:11,870
I sounded like my mother. I actually
think I said the word 'missy.'

193
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:16,760
And I actually believed Donny when he
told me that he was choosing celibacy.

194
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:18,703
A teenage boy doesn't choose celibacy.

195
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:22,408
Celibacy chooses you…
him… a teenage boy.

196
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:24,329
What are we gonna do?

197
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:28,806
Look, Cate. We can't just talk
to Bridget about contraception.

198
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:31,102
You might as well just fluff her
pillows and make her

199
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,189
some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

200
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,709
You are aware, Paul,
that only works for you.

201
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,556
Don't you see, that if we do
that, it’d be like we're giving

202
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,018
her permission to have sex. And if
we tell her ‘you can't have sex’,

203
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:47,282
you know she's definitely gonna have it.

204
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,547
Why couldn't she have
been born hideously ugly?

205
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,091
Ugly people have sex, too.

206
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:59,301
I just, you know, it's just such
a confusing time for these kids.

207
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:01,992
The media bombards them
with all these sex images.

208
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:04,742
Why do they have to make
it look so damn appealing?

209
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:07,640
I blame the French and
their crazy sex water.

210
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,454
As do we all, Paul.

211
00:13:11,743 --> 00:13:14,969
Okay look, you know we are
going to have to talk to her.

212
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:18,003
Fine. We'll talk to her
before her date with Donny.

213
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:22,963
It's so hard to be a girl.

214
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:27,936
You like a guy so much and you just
want to be with him, it feels so right.

215
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,823
Is that how you feel about me?

216
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:33,269
Sometimes.
- Sometimes?

217
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,781
Oh, God help us.

218
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:31,538
People were butt naked,
moaning like no tomorrow,

219
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,508
and I'm sitting like this close to Dad.

220
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,498
Hello, my social standing
could be impacted for decades

221
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:38,435
the way Mom's talking about
how everyone has these urges.

222
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,819
Oh yeah? Well I started to
choke on a popcorn kernel

223
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:44,105
and oxygen cut off to my brain
and everything went black.

224
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,429
Mom said 'vulva.'

225
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,614
You win.

226
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,825
Kerry, could you go downstairs for
a second? We wanna talk to your sister.

227
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:57,212
Sure, Mom. Dad.
- Kerry.

228
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,237
I want to look absolutely perfect
for my date with Donny tonight.

229
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,340
What do you think of this top?
- I think it should stay on.

230
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,449
I need something that says
I'm older, more sophisticated.

231
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:07,344
Something that says I'm a woman.
‘Cause tonight's a big night.

232
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,968
No, tonight is not the big
night and do you wanna know why?

233
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,443
I'll tell you why. Cate?

234
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:18,034
Honey, your Dad and I were together
for a long time before we had a 'big night.'

235
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:22,644
And might I add, we were deliriously
happy with all of our little nights.

236
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:25,718
Years and years of little nights,
little teenie weenie nights.

237
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:29,980
He said ‘teenie weenie.’
- Bridget. - What?

238
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:33,983
Look, what we're trying to say is
that sex is a big step. For all of us.

239
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:38,950
And we in no way want you to have
sex. We are not giving you permission.

240
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,635
What are you talking about? - Fine.
You want me to say it? I’ll say it.

241
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:45,465
safe sex, condoms, you know the drill.

242
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,489
Look, what your father
is trying to say is

243
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:56,205
that when it comes to sex, we
trust you to act responsibly.

244
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,940
What is with you people?
You're all just sex, sex, sex.

245
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:03,156
It's like you have a one track mind
and it's all... whatchamacallit... sex.

246
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,936
Honey, we know you wrote that question.

247
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,931
What question?

248
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,200
From the girl whose boyfriend
is coming from Maryland

249
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:16,030
and he's coming to town to, you know.

250
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:18,031
You thought that was me?

251
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:22,461
No, that was totally written by that new
girl who came from Maryland Lara O'Neal.

252
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,421
And she's definitely not gorgeous.
Talk about over inflated self esteem.

253
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:28,703
If somebody's willing to sleep
with her, she should jump on it.

254
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:31,168
Looks like someone
got a little paranoid.

255
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:36,781
Oh gosh, I gotta go.
How do I look? Wow. Really good.

256
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,166
Bridge, since, you and Donny aren't
having sex, what's up for tonight?

257
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,627
PG movie, home by eleven,
you know the drill.

258
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:47,553
You know after the movie why don't
you and Donny stop by so we can say hi?

259
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:49,526
No. I told the Doyles after the movie,

260
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,842
I'd be Mary Ellen's
partner in Bible Trivia.

261
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,949
Godspeed.

262
00:16:56,771 --> 00:17:00,749
Oh my God, this movie sounds amazing.

263
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,966
I'd show you the water bottle
scene, but my Dad made me

264
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:07,395
delete it from my hard drive.
Luckily, I've got it all up here.

265
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,866
Hey.
- Hey. Out.

266
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:15,333
Hi.

267
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:20,059
You know, I was a jerk the other day.

268
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:23,559
I was totally wrong
about that French movie.

269
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:26,084
It was important to you, all right?

270
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,024
And I think we should really go see it.

271
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,132
You heard about the scene?

272
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:35,622
There's a sexy water
bottle scene? I had no idea.

273
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:38,922
Go home.

274
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,545
I hate having a smart girlfriend.

275
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:47,586
Dad.
- Kerry. Care Bear, hang on.

276
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,843
Wait a second. You know
what? We have to talk.

277
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,141
I don't wanna talk! - I think we
should, about the moo… the…

278
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,322
you know, what we saw the other day.
- What? What?

279
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,759
It’s just that, you know, remember
when that guy came with the...

280
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:03,993
well, the truth, the
thing is… you know what?

281
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,243
Never mind. Carry on, goodnight.

282
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:11,270
No, wait. No, not goodnight! Dad, we
have nothing to be embarrassed about.

283
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:15,269
You're right. ‘Night.
- No, wait. Dad!

284
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,702
Come here, sit down.

285
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:24,327
Okay, you were thinking,
should you cover my eyes?

286
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:29,827
Or, should you laugh? Or
should you just do nothing,

287
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,980
because, you know, let
me draw my own conclusions

288
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:36,568
and instead of treating me like
a child? - Yes, that was one!

289
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,770
Right, okay, but you have
to admit it was really weird.

290
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,029
Oh, God. That was one of the
weird… especially… I could…

291
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:44,462
Okay, Dad, stop. Stop worrying.

292
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:46,568
I mean, I'm not scarred for life.

293
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:50,192
And despite being temporarily
totally creeped out,

294
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,217
I didn't hate having a
father daughter thing.

295
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,711
Good.
- Okay.

296
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:58,384
So we can do this again sometime?
- Yeah. In like a billion years.

297
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:00,580
It's a date.

298
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,685
The boy!

299
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:05,998
Come here. Hey! Right
here, sit down, park it.

300
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:10,778
Hey, Ror. Boy, I’ll tell you
something. It is not ‘E A S Y’

301
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,105
being the father of teenage girls.

302
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:15,126
But I think I'm really evolving.

303
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:19,636
And as for you, young man, did
you delete your downloaded movies?

304
00:19:19,803 --> 00:19:22,671
Look, 'Officer Internet',

305
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,591
if you're so worried about
obscene material, you should

306
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:27,615
probably take a look across the street.
- What do you mean?

307
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:31,012
Your daughter's alone with a sex starved
sailor who hasn't seen a woman in months.

308
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:34,032
Rory, she is not alone.
She's with the Doyles.

309
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,380
And even if she wasn’t,
I trust my daughter.

310
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,772
Does it concern you that the Doyles'
motor home is not in the driveway?

311
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:43,832
No. There could be a thousand reasons
why their camper's not in the driveway.

312
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:46,856
Like it's in Branson with
the rest of the Doyles?

313
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,278
Where it's been since Thursday?

314
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:52,113
Where they're celebrating
the Osmond family reunion?

315
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:57,160
Cate, are you hearing this?
- Bible trivia, my ass!

316
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:00,555
I hate the French!

317
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:05,151
Back to the Internet.

318
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:11,871
Lara O'Neal? Lara O'Neal?

319
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,905
Lara O'Neal, new girl from Maryland?

320
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,498
Does anyone know a Lara O'Neal?

321
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,135
Anyone?

322
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,161
I'm sick.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
