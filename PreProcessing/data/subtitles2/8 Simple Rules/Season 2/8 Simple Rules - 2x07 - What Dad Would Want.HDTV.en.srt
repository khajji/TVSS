1
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,919
Lois and I still can't believe it.

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:07,611
Oh, well you tell Lois
thank you for the casserole.

3
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:09,739
It's so sweet, but you know,

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,925
I have been back to work
for a month and I can cook.

5
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,960
Take care of each other.
- Will do.

6
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:28,508
You and Paul have such good friends.
He sure was loved. - Yeah.

7
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,408
Anyone else getting sick of it?

8
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:33,515
Honey, they're just trying
to show they care.

9
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:36,322
By bringing casseroles?
Everyone knows they're all carbs.

10
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:38,899
Is it impossible to say 'we're
here for you' with a salad?

11
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:41,705
And the worst part is the way
the 'casserole people' say hi.

12
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:44,254
Yeah, I know.
- It's... "Hi-i"

13
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,762
Look I don't think anybody means
offense by saying 'Hi. - Right.

14
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:51,680
That's what friends do. And if they
want to bring delicious things,

15
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,008
we'll just have to grin and eat it.

16
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:03,269
Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:09,064
You know, a lot of times,

18
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:12,581
people take orange
balls similar to this one

19
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:15,946
outside and shoot them
at basketball hoops.

20
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:18,187
Okay, but bring it back.

21
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,278
Hey, aren't basketball
tryouts in a few days?

22
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:25,070
Wednesday, I think. I don't know if
I'm going to do that anymore.

23
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,184
Rory, you were so
excited about basketball.

24
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,447
That's all you and Dad talked about.

25
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,606
Yeah, well, things change.

26
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,840
You know, your Dad wouldn't
want something you and he shared

27
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:40,395
to suddenly become meaningless for you.
- But it's not the same.

28
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:43,906
He taught me how to do a lay-up.
He was helping me practice.

29
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,308
And, besides, they're only
picking fourteen players.

30
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,382
You know, maybe your
grandfather could help you.

31
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:54,033
He was quite the basketball
player in his day. - Really?

32
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,857
Which one of the thirteen
colonies did he play for? - Hey!

33
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:00,204
Just think about it?

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,268
Your dad really would
have wanted that.

35
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:10,715
What's that? - I'm putting together a
collage for the scholarship kickoff dinner.

36
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:15,301
The one the newspaper
set up in Dad's honor?

37
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:19,190
The one you bought the new
outfit for? - Right. Thursday.

38
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:22,093
Mom, we got more cards.
- More?

39
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,098
Well, just put them on the desk.
I'll go through them later.

40
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:27,195
I gotta get to these
dirty casserole dishes.

41
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:30,676
Cate, don't bother yourself with those.
I'm in the process of washing them.

42
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:33,689
And I'm just letting them soak.
- Dad, no offense, but...

43
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,751
you've been soaking
them for two days.

44
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,824
How long does this process take?
- How would I know?

45
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:42,646
What are you doing? - I need
the scissors. - Well, I was using them.

46
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:46,393
Well, I have a stray bang hair. - Everyone
in the world stop what you're doing.

47
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:48,495
Bridget has a stray bang hair.
- Girls...

48
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:50,677
God, give them back! - I'm using them!
- They're my art scissors!

49
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,797
Why are you so selfish? - My hair is art.
- They're actually not even mine.

50
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,889
They're one of my friend's. - I'm sure, some
art dork who's thrilled I'm using them.

51
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,351
I said enough! For
the love of God, stop!

52
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:03,247
This endless bickering
is driving me nuts. - Oh, no.

53
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:08,245
Poor Mom. - Yeah, now I think we
upset her. - Yes. I think you did.

54
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,184
Girls, don't you think
your Mom has enough

55
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:14,473
to deal with right now
without you girls fighting.

56
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:17,791
So, what do ya say, we help
her out? - Okay. - Alright?

57
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:22,097
Now, there's still a lot of
cheese caked on those dishes,

58
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:25,117
so don't be afraid to put
your shoulders into it. Okay?

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,595
I'll be right outside.

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,249
Hey, what do you say we work on
your endurance after you're done?

61
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,548
You want me to walk up with you to the
store to get cigarettes, don't you?

62
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:43,191
Well, nahi... yeah.

63
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,276
Looking pretty good, pal.
- Not good enough.

64
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,919
Dad always said games are won and lost
on free throws. - Smart man, your dad.

65
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:55,458
Did you know his team won the state
championship two years in a row?

66
00:03:56,613 --> 00:04:00,645
Well, back when I was playing ball
with Ben Franklin and the boys...

67
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,326
Mom told you what I said?
- Just give me the ball.

68
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:11,299
That's pretty funny. I've got
a friend who can kick it in.

69
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,997
Hey, that's a real shot.
It improves your odds of

70
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,996
making a free throw when you
shoot from between your legs.

71
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:20,174
I think it'd also improve my odds
of getting beat up after tryouts.

72
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,593
Hey, guys. - Cate, would you tell your
son it doesn't make any difference

73
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:27,002
what other people think about
the way he shoots the ball?

74
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,280
Well, I don't know, Dad. I mean
then people in the stands would know

75
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:33,938
the kid doing the 'granny shot'
was my son. I don't need that.

76
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:37,034
Well, then fine.
You know what I need?

77
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:40,194
I am not taking you to the store
for cigarettes. - Oh, crap.

78
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:59,452
...our cameras followed Jan as she went
in search of her 'Extreme Makeover!'

79
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:03,473
Here's what the doctors did. Her nasal
bridge was shaved and sculpted.

80
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:06,367
Her teeth capped. Eyelids
lifted. Fat is lyposuctioned from

81
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:09,214
tummy, buttocks, and thigh
sections. But in the end,

82
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:13,224
will the surgeons achieve
the look Jan's striving for?

83
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:15,676
This was Jan before.

84
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:19,218
This is Jan after her
Extreme Makeover.

85
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,962
Jan! You're pretty now! Oh my...

86
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,362
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, God.

87
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:29,633
No, no, no.
Not pretty!

88
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:41,817
Hey. - 'Sup? - Have you seen my
collage? I wanna go put it away.

89
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:46,363
Yes. I have seen your collage actually.

90
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:51,402
Kerry, the truth is I took it to be framed.

91
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:55,740
What? - Yeah. I just
thought it was so beautiful

92
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,763
and that it would look
more beautiful in a frame.

93
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:04,302
Bridge, I love this not-fighting thing.
- Oh, cling to that.

94
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,360
I heard the door.

95
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,992
I thought maybe it was Rory back
from basketball tryouts. - No.

96
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,887
Just me, back from my walk.
- With your laundry?

97
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:26,280
If your neighbors want to help us through
these difficult times, I say we let them.

98
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,120
You know, Dad, I think we might
have finally found a use for you.

99
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:33,531
Well, you sound like
you're in a good mood.

100
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:36,871
Yeah, well I got Rory to go
to his basketball tryouts.

101
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,113
So, yeah, I feel pretty good.

102
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,735
I sure hope he makes the team.

103
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:48,125
Okay, now not so good.
Why wouldn't he make the team?

104
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:52,791
Well, I didn't say he wouldn't.
Miracles happen.

105
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:58,179
How bad is he? - No, no. He's
not bad. He's got a lot of heart.

106
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,771
Oh no, not 'a lot of heart!'

107
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:04,095
What was I thinking
making him go try out?

108
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:08,813
Hi. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:12,102
I made the team!
- Told you he would!

110
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,302
Hey, Beach.
- Hey!

111
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,917
Mom, do you have any pictures of Dad?

112
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,065
Of course, honey.
Whatever you want.

113
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,927
Okay, good. I need like, twenty-five,
from various stages of his life.

114
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:30,083
For my wallet.
- What are you up to?

115
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,266
Nothing. Why are you
so suspicious? God.

116
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:37,129
Rory, I told you not to
bounce the ball in the house.

117
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,376
Hi, Mom, blonde sister.

118
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,221
Rory, you ruined Kerry's collage!

119
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:47,068
But the ball landed over and
it's all wet and there's cheese on it...

120
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,252
Shut up. Be a man, own up to it.

121
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:51,499
You're going to have to talk to Kerry.
- What's everyone doing in there?

122
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:54,594
Bridget, actually, I think you're
the one who needs to talk to Kerry.

123
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:57,388
Come on, we're going.
Let's go, Rory. - I'll catch up.

124
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,861
No, come on, let's go.

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,316
Talk to me about what?
- Nothing. - Oh, okay.

126
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:06,314
Did you happen to get my
collage back from the frame store?

127
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,885
Yeah... you know how we're
not fighting any more?

128
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:14,041
Such a good thing.
- Oh my God. What happened to it?

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,708
You're going to laugh.
See, I was cleaning this pan

130
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:22,554
and this amazing show came on TV. I mean,
they made this ugly, fat woman hot.

131
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,685
It's like, with the miracles
in plastic surgery today,

132
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,807
there's just no excuse to be ugly.

133
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,733
Can I see it? - I didn't put
a tape in the VCR. Sorry.

134
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:33,850
My collage.
- You know,

135
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:36,641
Rory is not totally blameless in this.

136
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:50,622
You're taking this really well.

137
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:54,490
Because we decided
not to fight anymore.

138
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:07,353
Look at all these pictures
of Dad. - I know.

139
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:11,358
You know what would have
gone great here? Your collage.

140
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:15,904
Look at all this stuff, mom.
- It looks like the Hall of Fame.

141
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:19,565
Well, we're all gonna
have a nice time.

142
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:23,945
We're all gonna have fun. - Cate!
- Oh, God. - Still having fun, Mom?

143
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,026
Hi, Tommy.
- Hey, some turn out, huh?

144
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,379
Everybody loved Paul.
Except that guy.

145
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,690
Tommy, I need your help. Who is this
woman that keeps waving at me?

146
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,444
Come on, you've met her a number
of times. She's been here forever.

147
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,308
Well, what's her name? - 'Boobs', from
reception. - Thank you, Tommy. - De nada.

148
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:44,930
Cate!
- You!

149
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,336
Are you all okay?

150
00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:56,231
Oh, yeah, we're... we're fine.

151
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:59,539
I'm not doing so hot.

152
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:07,513
So, on behalf of my husband,
I really want to say thank you

153
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,410
to all of you here at the Detroit Post.

154
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:14,608
It would have warmed his heart
establishing a scholarship

155
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:17,566
for high school seniors
to pursue a degree

156
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:20,729
in journalism at the
college of their choice.

157
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:24,945
Sorry, Paul, that includes Ohio State.

158
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:31,721
Anyway, thank you. Thank
you so much. - Yeah!

159
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,625
Lucky me. I have to
follow the widow.

160
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,602
I first met Paul Hennessy when we
were sports writers here together.

161
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,519
And, he was a sports nut.

162
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,908
And he would have been proud today.
Because Cate just informed me before,

163
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,659
that his little guy, Rory there,
just made the school basketball team.

164
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:11,526
You told him?! And now
he told everybody here?

165
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,656
Well, Rory, your father
would have wanted...

166
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:15,856
Is there anything Dad
wouldn't have wanted?

167
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,884
No, let him go.

168
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:26,728
Curtis, this is Rory's Mom.
Have you seen him tonight?

169
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,782
Well, if you do, would you
have him call me? Thanks.

170
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:35,562
You had to say let him go?
- Well, I thought he'd be right back.

171
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:39,306
Yeah, I know. Why do you think
he just ran out like that?

172
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:42,789
Well, maybe the event got to
him. He was pretty emotional.

173
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,230
I know I needed my share of hugs.

174
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,763
You know what, I'm going
to call his basketball coach.

175
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:49,949
Maybe he's hanging out
with some of those kids.

176
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,108
The coach will have a roster.

177
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,316
Hi, is Coach Rooney there?

178
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:58,603
Sure, I'll hold on.
Maybe that's him.

179
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:05,745
Hi - Hi, Helen.
- I hope I'm not troubling you.

180
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:09,681
I just wanted to stop by and
see how you folks are doing?

181
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:12,985
How am I doing? My son's
missing, my husband's dead,

182
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:16,030
I have a freezer full
of casseroles. You?

183
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:22,007
You're gonna want to put this on
three-fifty for 45 minutes. - Thanks.

184
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:30,446
What? - They mean well, honey.
- Yeah, I know they mean well!

185
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,483
But I'm starting to feel like
I'm in some kind of circus

186
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,801
and the price of
admission is a casserole!

187
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,637
Step right up, see the
grieving widow! - Oh, Cate...

188
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,319
Yeah, every time I start
to feel like I'm okay,

189
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,569
someone reminds me
that I lost my husband.

190
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,548
It's like getting punched
in the stomach.

191
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:49,084
You're entitled to feel
that way. But, honey...

192
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,224
they're entitled to miss Paul, too.
You gotta give them that.

193
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,532
It's your fault you married
a man who's so well liked.

194
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,420
Okay, would you just yell at
me for ruining your collage?

195
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:05,932
I can't take this tension anymore.
- What tension? - Okay, that's it.

196
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,348
Kerry, I just cannot
live with myself so...

197
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:14,147
What are you doing?! Stop!

198
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:17,246
There. I ruined your collage and
now I ruined my favorite top.

199
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:19,811
God, we're even.
I can finally breathe.

200
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:24,053
That was my top. - What are you
talking about? I wear it all the time.

201
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,479
Because you borrowed it
and you didn't give it back.

202
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:30,279
Oh, yeah.
Then yell at me for that.

203
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,942
Look, we're not fighting anymore.
Remember, for Mom?

204
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:39,491
Besides, it was an accident.
And I know you felt really, really bad.

205
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,639
Yeah, I did feel really bad...

206
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,531
except for the little
part of me that didn't.

207
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:53,396
You have my attention.

208
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:55,538
It's just that when
it happened, Kerry,

209
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:58,516
I was kinda... glad.

210
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,946
Go on.

211
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:06,765
All I know is when I saw your collage
I was so totally impressed.

212
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:10,062
And so totally jealous.

213
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,198
Jealous? - Totally.

214
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:15,524
Kerry, you and Dad
had so much in common.

215
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:17,759
I mean, he was a writer,
you're an artist.

216
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,427
You had this special connection,

217
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:24,238
because you guys were so much
alike and we just weren't.

218
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:29,933
You idiot! Are you blind?

219
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,747
Okay, now you're yelling at me.
- Yeah, because I'm mad!

220
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:36,505
Good! Finally. Go with that.
- You and Dad had a special connection.

221
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:40,358
You know how wherever he went he
would light up the whole room...

222
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:43,286
you totally do that!
And when people meet you

223
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,412
they instantly like you and
they want to be friends with you.

224
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:48,478
Just like they did with him.

225
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:51,289
How can you not see that?
Are you that stupid?

226
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:54,335
I know this is supposed to be a pep talk,
so, could you like, stop calling me stupid.

227
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,438
Well, you are.
- Well, it takes one to know one.

228
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:59,685
Have you heard a word I've said?
- Yes, I heard you!

229
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:03,323
I'm like Dad! That was sweet!
Thank you! - You're welcome!

230
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,823
And thank you for goading
me into fighting with you

231
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,914
when I'm trying to be a better
person, but obviously I'm not.

232
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:12,692
Obviously. But I'm glad
we cleared the air.

233
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,900
Sisters are supposed to fight.

234
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:17,489
You know the most important
thing we learned from this?

235
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:22,314
Right. Dad would want us to
express our true feelings.

236
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,545
No. I got you to get mad when you said
you weren't. So I win. I always win.

237
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:38,530
I called everywhere.
Where have you been?

238
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:50,149
Rory, don't pull stunts like that.

239
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,333
I was so worried.

240
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:57,293
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
run out of there. I just...

241
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,556
I think I know why.
- You do?

242
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,457
I spoke to Coach Rooney.
- Oh, no.

243
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:05,920
He told you I didn't make the team.

244
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:10,239
How come you didn't tell me?
- I don't know.

245
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,807
I kept hearing from you it's
what Dad would have wanted.

246
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,716
I was embarrassed. - Did I put
that kind of pressure on you?

247
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:20,691
No, no, no... Well, yeah.

248
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,977
Look, what your dad would have wanted

249
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:28,728
was for you to have fun and be happy
like any other fourteen year-old kid.

250
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:32,591
Oh, great, now I have to have fun and
be happy. I don't feel happy right now.

251
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,831
Okay, I'm gonna stop saying

252
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:37,955
what dad would have wanted.
- Thanks.

253
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:45,246
Rory, Coach Rooney told
me something else. - What?

254
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,657
Well, he said that
since you were cut,

255
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:52,702
that you've shown up every day
and asked to work out with the team

256
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:55,521
because you wanted
to get better. - So?

257
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:59,712
So, he said you showed
him something.

258
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,899
As of now,

259
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:05,958
you are on the team.
- I am? Alright!

260
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:09,756
Yeah, I know, he said that
you showed him a lot of...

261
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:13,159
you know, a lot of...
- God, not 'a lot of heart.

262
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:16,257
That's like when a girl tells you she
likes you as a friend. - No, no.

263
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:20,896
No, honey, it was 'stick-to-it-iveness.
Perseverance. - Heart. - Yes.

264
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:26,085
Oh, who cares, you made the team.
- But, it's not the same.

265
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,559
Dad was such a great
athlete on all these teams.

266
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,221
I want to be more than
a guy that has 'a lot of heart.

267
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,367
I want to be good at something.

268
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,082
Oh, honey, yeah, your Dad played on

269
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,766
a lot of teams in high school.
Some great teams.

270
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,582
I know. He told
me a thousand times.

271
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,899
Let me show you
something. Come here.

272
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,880
You see this?
- Yeah, that's a team picture

273
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:58,312
after they won the state championship.
- Alright, now look closely.

274
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:02,369
You see how all these guys over here are
all sweaty and their hair's messed up?

275
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:06,328
Okay, now there's your dad.

276
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:10,681
Not a hair out of place.
Dry as a bone.

277
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,883
I don't know how to
tell you this, honey, but

278
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,035
your father also played
with a lot of heart.

279
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,891
He was on the bench?
- Well, not always.

280
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,536
There was the occasional blow out,
you know, garbage time.

281
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:31,220
Look, your dad loved sports.

282
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:35,411
Because of that love, he
became a sports writer.

283
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:37,836
And he was really,
really good at it.

284
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,566
And what your dad
would have want...

285
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:46,324
what I want is for you to find

286
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,517
something that you
have passion for.

287
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,228
I think I want to sit
on the bench with the

288
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,566
rest of the guys on
the team. Just like Dad.

289
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:04,340
And then maybe when I'm out of
school I can pursue my passion.

290
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:07,508
And what's that?
- I have some ideas.

291
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:23,634
That kid's got a lot of heart.

9999
