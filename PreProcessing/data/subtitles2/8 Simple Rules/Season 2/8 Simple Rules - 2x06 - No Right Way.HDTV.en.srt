1
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:03,563
Oh, great.
I’m getting a huge zit.

2
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:05,470
Where?
I don’t see anything.

3
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:08,004
Oh, don’t pretend like you can’t see it.
It’s right there.

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,279
And it’s getting bigger by the second.
Please don’t make me go to school.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,180
Okay, I get it.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,935
Listen, I know today’s
gonna be difficult.

7
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:19,535
But we have to start moving forward.

8
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,083
You’ve you’ve already
missed two weeks of school.

9
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:25,162
We just have to start
getting on with our lives.

10
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:27,115
I just need one more day
with some hot compresses,

11
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,079
and I promise I’ll go back tomorrow.

12
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:31,104
Honey, I don’t think
staying home is the answer.

13
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:34,437
Come on, Mom. What’s the big deal if we
take one more day to feel sad?

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,615
Honey, I just think we all have
to start getting back to normal.

15
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:43,464
Mom, if things were normal, Dad
would be the one taking us to school.

16
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,560
Yeah. Wearing those horrible,
old people slippers.

17
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:48,985
And making us ‘healthy’
sack lunches, that we

18
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:51,249
just threw out in the
first available trash can.'

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,709
Right, he was so lame.
- God, what a geek.

20
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:56,879
Dad.

21
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,529
Look.
I know this is tough.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,597
I I don’t really feel like
going back to work today either.

23
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,537
But we have to.

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,553
So come on.
Let’s do it.

25
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,942
Um, you’re gonna take
us to school in that?

26
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,397
Yeah.
- What is that?

27
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,874
It’s a housecoat. - Well, maybe
it’s called a housecoat ‘cause you

28
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,960
should only wear it in the
privacy of your own house.

29
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:23,162
What is the big deal?
No one’s gonna see me in the car.

30
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:26,753
Damn right, they’re not. ‘Cause you’re gonna
drop us like two blocks from school.

31
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:29,556
Congratulations, Mom.
You’re just as lame as Dad.

32
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,457
Hey now, wait a minute.

33
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:34,323
That’s so sweet.

34
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,623
So, go change.

35
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,645
And put a brush through your hair.
- And a bra wouldn’t kill ya.

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,627
#8 SIMPLE RULES#

37
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,494
Wow.
Who died?

38
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,688
Oh, my God.
I’m so sorry.

39
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,681
I can’t believe I said that.
What’s wrong with me?

40
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:58,602
Bridget, nothing is wrong with you.

41
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:01,129
This is all just really weird.

42
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,319
Yeah, I know.

43
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,655
Well, look, we have each other.
- Yes, we’ll do this together.

44
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:11,059
We missed you guys so much.
- You did?

45
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,135
But before I was an
outcast, persona au gratin.

46
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:18,556
Non grata.
- Oui.

47
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,328
Truly, the group was
not the same without you.

48
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,602
Uh, really?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,672
It’s just like in Charlie’s
Angels how there’s a blonde,

50
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:29,970
and a brunette and a kinda something else.
We are so glad to have our blonde back.

51
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:33,022
I’m blonde.
- Yeah right, Danielle. So, get this.

52
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,678
We were all totally obsessing about
our dates for the dance on Friday night,

53
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,023
and some people weren’t getting
asked, and I won’t name names Dana.

54
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:42,270
So we all decided we’d go stag and
totally play the boys against each other.

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,497
Oh, I think under the
given circumstances that.

56
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:46,756
Oh, I love that.

57
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:50,134
Bridget?
You’re really talking about this?

58
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,296
Yeah, did you hear their strategy?
It is very clever.

59
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:55,372
Yeah.
About a stupid dance.

60
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:58,629
Don’t you think this inane conversation
is just a little bit too soon?

61
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,956
Yeah, you’re right.

62
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,988
But if it weren’t, oh my
gosh, I have the greatest idea

63
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:06,008
we plan a song list that is just
one hot, sexy song after another,

64
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:08,836
and then we torture the guys
by only dancing with each other.

65
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,922
Now that is brilliant.

66
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,040
No, I was just building off
what you were already doing.

67
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:16,667
No way, that was way more brilliant.
- No, well, you’re brillianter.

68
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,248
Ugh nice life.

69
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:24,283
Oh, hey guys.

70
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,139
You didn’t ring the doorbell.
- Yeah, that’s strange.

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,109
‘Cause I always ring the doorbell
when I come into my own house.

72
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:34,413
Well, maybe if you’d have rung the
bell, you’d have noticed that I fixed it.

73
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,359
Oh, that’s nice.

74
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:40,460
Well, aren’t you gonna try it?
- What?

75
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,482
The doorbell.

76
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,766
I believe you that you fixed it.

77
00:03:44,814 --> 00:03:48,381
Well, when I said I fixed it, maybe
I was being unnecessarily modest.

78
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:52,414
You know, I’m talking three hours at
the hardware store trying out doorbells

79
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:57,039
‘til I found the exact right one that
says, “This is where the Hennessy’s live."

80
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:01,070
Rory, would you do the honor?

81
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:10,545
Wow.
You really nailed us.

82
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,506
I know.

83
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:14,514
Rory, did you do your homework?

84
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,051
Actually, my teachers said
it was optional for me.

85
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,244
I could do it if I felt like it.

86
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,884
Well, I’m sure they’re
just trying to be nice.

87
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,857
Everyone’s being so weird, lately.

88
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:26,140
They picked me first for
football even though I suck.

89
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,655
Missy Kleinfeld who never
talks to me was talking to me.

90
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,304
And the cafeteria lady
gave me all this extra milk.

91
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:34,701
Apparently, pity milk
doesn’t come in chocolate.

92
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,860
Hey, honey, how was school?

93
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,054
Horrible.
Everyone was all fake and phony.

94
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,383
It made me sick.
God, I hate everyone.

95
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,908
All I want to do is be alone
for the rest of my life.

96
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,268
Bye guys.
- Quick.

97
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,594
Lock the door so Bridget
has to ring the bell.

98
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:55,070
Hi.
- Damn.

99
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,059
You know, honey, I know
today was really rough.

100
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,610
But but you’re home now,
and it’s gonna be okay.

101
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:03,201
What are you talking about?
- Your day at school.

102
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:05,621
Ring a bell?

103
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:09,170
Rory.
- It was begging for it.

104
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,573
Um, Mom, actually
everyone was really nice.

105
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:14,389
And there’s a dance this weekend.
So I’m gonna have to get a new dress.

106
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,936
Oh, honey, I’m really happy
that you’re adjusting but,

107
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:19,390
uh, we can’t buy you a new
dress for every occasion.

108
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,636
Oh, hmm, okay, but I don’t
know how I’m supposed to

109
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:25,183
torture guys with something
I’ve already worn before.

110
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:29,368
I do admit it’s possible.
I’ve done more with less.

111
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,101
Rory, could you stop doing that?

112
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,694
Grant you, I’m annoying.
But I’m not a magician.

113
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,862
I’ll get it.

114
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,774
Hey, you fixed the doorbell.
- I love this guy.

115
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,305
Kyle, I am so glad you’re here.

116
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,393
You know, Kerry’s been really down.

117
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,490
I’m thinking maybe you
could take her someplace fun.

118
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:53,030
You know, like like an arcade. - Yeah, sure
of course. - Okay, I’m gonna give you money.

119
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:56,471
Ah, Momma H, I will not take your
daughter out and make you pay.

120
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,433
Oh, Kyle, you’re such a gentleman.

121
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,941
I insist. - No, I insist. - I don’t want to
hear another word about it.

122
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,458
Take the money.
- All right.

123
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,858
That’s it?

124
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,756
You want to play air hockey?
- I don’t know. - Oh, come on.

125
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,721
When you bend over, sometimes
I can see down your shirt.

126
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,485
Kyle!
- Okay, yeah, I know.

127
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,199
Let’s do the dance game. You always
kick my butt at the dance game.

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Yeah, that’s true.

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,860
She smiles.

130
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:36,216
Yeah, okay, I can’t help but laugh.
You’re a really bad dancer.

131
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:40,098
Well, I’m not that bad.
- No, you really are.

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,717
I love you.

133
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:48,373
What?
- You heard me.

134
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,614
Ah, there you are, you little devils.

135
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:03,585
What are you doing now?
- I’m installing dimmer switches.

136
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,729
You’re welcome.

137
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,286
Uh, so, Dad, how long
were you planning on staying?

138
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:13,347
You know, just out of curiosity.

139
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:16,163
Oh, I see: ‘Thanks for
the dimmer switches, Dad.

140
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,342
But, don’t let the door hit you on the
ass on the way out. - No, no, no, no.

141
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:23,387
I’m I’m really glad you’re here and
the kids are really glad you’re here.

142
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,452
You can stay as long as you want.

143
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:28,065
It’s just you know, if you
wanna help maybe you could

144
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:32,308
help me with something I
actually need help with? - Like?

145
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,868
I don’t know.
Maybe groceries?

146
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,859
I’m not too good at groceries.

147
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,155
I can do them, but I just
don’t think it’s a man’s job.

148
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:46,859
Okay, how about laundry?

149
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:49,093
You’re joking.

150
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,977
Well, I know, Dad, you know
Kerry has been really down.

151
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:54,644
Maybe you could talk to her, and
try to get to the bottom of things.

152
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:58,188
Ahh getting to the bottom of things
was always your mother’s area.

153
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:02,066
Yeah, and she’s gone and left you.

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,295
Perhaps there’s a connection.

155
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,986
No, I don’t see it.

156
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:12,265
Oh, hi honey, how was the arcade?

157
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,338
I broke up with Kyle.
- Oh, no honey.

158
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,281
What happened?
- It’s fine. Whatever.

159
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,182
It just figures

160
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,360
How did you know we went to the arcade?

161
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:25,184
Well, you must have said that’s
where you were going before you left.

162
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:27,485
No, I didn’t.

163
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,847
Well, then, you you know,
you said it when you got home.

164
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:33,692
No, didn’t say it then either.

165
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:36,591
I guessed?

166
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,135
Oh, my God, that’s why Kyle
was suddenly Mister Big Spender.

167
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:43,390
You set the whole thing up.
- Oh, honey, I was just trying to help.

168
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:45,344
Well, don’t.
Don’t help.

169
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:48,294
Just leave me and my
horrible life alone.

170
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:53,429
So, Mom, get this at the coffee shop I
was only at number nine on my punch card

171
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,748
but I think the coffee guy had a crush
on me so he gave me my mochachinno

172
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:59,161
for free which was so sweet, but yeah,
like I’m gonna go out with a barrister.

173
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,659
Honey, a barrister is a lawyer in England.
- Oh, well, I guess the degree doesn’t

174
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,693
translate because he’s
only making coffee here.

175
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:11,105
Bridget, look, your sister’s
upstairs and she’s really upset,

176
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,408
so could you just tone the
cheeriness down a little.

177
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,340
Oh, what else is new?
- What’s that supposed to mean?

178
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:20,267
Fruit cup girl thrives on being
depressed. - Fruit cup girl?

179
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,736
Yeah, that’s what the kids were calling
her today at school because all she

180
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:25,268
would do was sit alone in the cafeteria
picking at this disgusting fruit cup.

181
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,473
You know, Bridget, you need to cool it.

182
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,649
If Kerry wants to be sad it’s
her choice, it’s unfair that

183
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,829
I have to pretend like
everything’s terrible when it isn’t.

184
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,202
Honey, it’s only been two weeks.
Not everyone is as resilient as you are.

185
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,284
It is not my fault
that Kerry is depressed.

186
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,525
God, I can’t believe I’m being
punished for being happy.

187
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,598
This place sucks.

188
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,101
Sorry.

189
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:49,877
This place sucks.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,943
Kerry? Honey? Can we talk?
- Go away.

191
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:57,293
Look, I I was just trying to help.

192
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:03,636
Bridge, you in there?
- Go away.

193
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:07,395
Look, honey, I shouldn’t have yelled at you.
I’m sorry. I really am sorry!

194
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:10,246
You already said that.
- I wasn’t talking to you.

195
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,489
Good.
Don’t talk to me.

196
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:17,552
You can buy a new dress for the dance.
- Really?

197
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,567
‘Cause I know exactly
which one I’m gonna get.

198
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,266
It’s a red, which I know is not
usually my color, but it really works.

199
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,950
I don’t think there’s a color
out there I can’t make prettier.

200
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,481
You’re buying her a dress for the dance?

201
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:30,044
Well, I didn’t say we’ll see.

202
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,398
Now you’re going back on your word?
Unbelievable!

203
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,215
God, no one says what they mean!

204
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,032
I’m still getting the dress, right?

205
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:44,828
Uh, I guess. Yes.
- You’re the best.

206
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:54,016
Gramps, can I ask you something?

207
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,145
Shoot.
- And you won’t tell anyone?

208
00:10:57,146 --> 00:11:00,285
I don’t really talk to a lot of people.

209
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:03,774
Okay, remember that
girl, Missy Kleinfeld?

210
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,261
She’s got this freckly
little nose, killer smile,

211
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,834
been in a bra since the
sixth grade, and really big...

212
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,725
I got it from ‘bra in sixth grade.

213
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,623
Anyway, she’s been
offering to help me catch up

214
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,685
on the work I missed when
I was gone from school.

215
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,097
And the thing is, I don’t need any help.

216
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:23,912
But, I’ve been staring at
that bra for a lot of years,

217
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,860
and I’m just wondering, am
I taking advantage of her?

218
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,605
Well, you know what I think?

219
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,102
I got a sneaky suspicion this Missy
Kleinfeld is taking advantage of you.

220
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,006
She is? - Yeah.
And you know what I say?

221
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,765
Huh?
- Let her.

222
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,228
My key didn’t work in the lock.

223
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:10,696
I bet you’re pretty glad
I fixed the doorbell.

224
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,704
What is going on?
- I changed the locks.

225
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:16,877
Now you have just one key to
open the front door and the back.

226
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:20,732
Wow, actually, Dad, that
makes things a lot easier.

227
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,746
Except Gramps already lost the key.
- Ah, well it’s no big deal.

228
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:28,478
Someone just has to stay home at
all times to let the rest of us in.

229
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,694
My vote is for blabbermouth.

230
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:35,938
Hey hey, honey, you okay?

231
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,036
Oh, do I look down?

232
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,657
Well, maybe you should hire
Kyle to take me somewhere

233
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,955
or I know, you could
always buy me a new dress.

234
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:45,827
You cannot speak to me that way.
- I’m sorry.

235
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,755
I guess I should just be
all fake and sweet like

236
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,037
Bridget and take whatever my
little grubby hands can get.

237
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:52,144
Kerry! Ugh!

238
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,123
Okay, so were all gonna
go to Jenna’s, before

239
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,051
the dance, so we can
give each other makeovers.

240
00:12:56,495 --> 00:13:00,877
Ah, honey, is is that the dress
you bought with my credit card?

241
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:03,816
Yeah.
Isn’t it great?

242
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,222
I mean, you get good boob dresses and
good butt dresses and goodleg dresses,

243
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:08,177
but it’s hardly ever you get
a good boob butt leg dress.

244
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,119
Know what I mean?
- Jiminy Christmas.

245
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:14,547
Well, honey, I don’t
know, it’s a little

246
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,551
Slutty.

247
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:20,830
Mom, you said I could get any dress I
wanted and this was the dress that I wanted.

248
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:26,866
Well, have a good time.

249
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,787
Thank you.

250
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,095
What’s wrong?

251
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:46,419
I never would have got this far before.

252
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,584
Dad would’ve never let
me go out like this.

253
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,029
He would have he would have definitely
sent me upstairs to change and

254
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,065
told me to cover myself
up in some hideous sweater

255
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:59,270
and sit me down for an
hour lecture on how I should

256
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:01,764
respect myself because
guys only want one thing.

257
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,816
And I always hated it when he did that.

258
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:07,457
I just want my dad back.
- Bridget. - Leave me alone.

259
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:17,083
None of my business.

260
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,002
Would you stop trying to
fix things and just help?

261
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:29,423
Same to you, baby girl.

262
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,661
Come here.

263
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,094
I know.

264
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:53,489
Oh we lost your dad, you guys.

265
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,424
We lost him.

266
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,243
He’s gone.

267
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,845
And he’s not coming back.

268
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:06,698
But listen, there is no
right way to deal with this.

269
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,451
I was just trying so hard
to be happy, you know.

270
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:13,315
Because, if I was happy everything
would be normal, and nothing’s normal.

271
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,441
It’s just not working.

272
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,614
It’s okay.

273
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:23,069
And I felt so guilty that something
good was happening in my life

274
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:26,923
at the same time that this
terrible thing was happening.

275
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:31,019
Well, honey, what was happening?
What what was your good thing?

276
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,108
Kyle said I

277
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:40,099
I don’t know he was just
trying to be sweet.

278
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,997
What did he say?

279
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:47,081
It’s dumb. He said he loved me.
But, he doesn’t.

280
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:51,241
Well, maybe he does.

281
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,057
No, he’s just feeling sorry for me.

282
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,709
Listen there is no manual
on how to deal with this.

283
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:03,366
It’s okay to be happy when you’re happy.

284
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,680
Honey, it’s okay to
be sad when you’re sad.

285
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,793
God, and now I’m happy
because Bridget’s really sad.

286
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:13,099
I’m so screwed up.

287
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,649
Oh, sweetheart, we’re all screwed up.

288
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,038
The important thing is that we
stay together and we support each other.

289
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:26,372
I love you guys so much.

290
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,401
I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

291
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:36,503
Bridge?
- Yeah?

292
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:41,084
You’re too pretty for this dress.

293
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,070
What?

294
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:47,477
I just think it’s for some
girl who has to try really hard.

295
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,764
And you don’t.

296
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:53,801
You should respect yourself.

297
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,239
Like Dad was always telling you to.

298
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,909
Because you deserve the best.

299
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,743
You deserve the best, too.

300
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,875
No, I don’t.
- No, listen.

301
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,144
What Kyle said to you, he meant it.

302
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,076
How do you know?

303
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:17,466
Kyle and I went out for a
really long time. - Yeah?

304
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,651
He never said it to me.

305
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:36,995
Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,706
Come here.

307
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,769
Kyle, why did you say you loved me?

308
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,779
Well, see,

309
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,839
when your dad died.
- Yeah, that’s what I thought.

310
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,328
No. - No, you felt sorry for me.
Never mind.

311
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:02,468
No, that’s not it. It’s just, when your dad
died, it it made me realize that you have to

312
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,686
say the things that you feel because
you might not get another chance.

313
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:10,065
Oh.

314
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:17,093
Anything you feel like
you want to say back?

315
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,895
I’ll get back to you.

316
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:29,609
Hey, honey. - You sure you don’t want
to go to the dance? - Yeah, I’m sure.

317
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,689
I think I’m just gonna
go upstairs and change.

318
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,429
Okay.

319
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,133
You know, Dad, you keep
working at this pace,

320
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,168
you’re gonna run out of
things to do around here.

321
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,414
Not likely.

322
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,605
Okay, I’m listening.

323
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:52,612
What? - Listening.
It’s a form of helping.

324
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:58,150
At night, it’s the worst.

325
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:01,461
I hear ambulances or a
noise and I jump up out

326
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:04,338
of the bed with this
scared, panicky feeling.

327
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:09,766
Only, I I don’t know what I’m scared for
because what I’m scared of already happened.

328
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:16,303
I still feel like he’s
gonna walk through that door.

329
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:25,674
Okay and then you carry that
and divide the whole thing by X.

330
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:29,263
Wow, Missy, that is
some really tough stuff.

331
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:33,784
Maybe you could show me how to
do it one more time. - Yeah, sure.

332
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:37,016
See, when you solve the equation
all the variables come together

333
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,547
and you wanna make
sure it’s on one step.
