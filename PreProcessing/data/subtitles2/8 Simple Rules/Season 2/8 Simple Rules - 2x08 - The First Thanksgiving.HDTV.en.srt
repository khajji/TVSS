1
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:05,830
Good morning!
- Good morning!

2
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:10,996
Happy Thanksgiving, Dad.
- You're in a good mood.

3
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:14,285
Well, why wouldn't I be?
I have a lot to be thankful for.

4
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,543
Dad, what the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:21,619
I thought I'd start
Thanksgiving dinner.

6
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:24,399
I've always wanted to
take a stab at cooking.

7
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:28,678
Where do you keep the...
- Turkeys?

8
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:33,500
Aprons. And the turkey.

9
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,729
You know, Dad, I really
appreciate the gesture, but

10
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,314
are you sure you wanna
start something that you've...

11
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,921
well, never done before?

12
00:00:41,187 --> 00:00:44,871
Well, I didn't hear any complaining about
me babysitting the kids last night.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,697
Babysitting? You watched TV.

14
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:52,027
Are any of them missing? Any
broken bones? You're welcome.

15
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:55,626
Look, Dad, why don't...
here... sit down.

16
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:59,168
Why don't you start slowly by just...

17
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,602
helping... oh, I got it...

18
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:06,221
Here's a can. Here's
a can opener. - I'm on it.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,340
Hey, Gramps. Wanna watch
the game with me?

20
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:14,177
I can't, Rory.
I'm busy opening a can.

21
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,400
There, it's done. You
know, after all that,

22
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,141
I may have to take a little break.

23
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,038
Mom, are those grocery bags?
- From the grocery store?

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,727
Mom, please tell me that you're not
planning on cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

25
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:33,316
You said we were going to go to
a restaurant for a quick meal.

26
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,673
Yes, because it didn't seem
right this year, remember?

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,881
Well, you know...
I know I said that

28
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,822
a couple of days ago,
but then last night...

29
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,411
I couldn't sleep and...
suddenly I knew why

30
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,295
I know exactly how you feel.
I get up two or three times a night.

31
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,914
Thank you, Dad.
But what I meant was...

32
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:58,667
I suddenly realized that I
could blow off Thanksgiving

33
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:01,730
or I could choose to enjoy the day.

34
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:04,428
You know, sometimes it's four or five...

35
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:09,203
if I drink anything after three o'clock
in the afternoon I'm a racehorse.

36
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,864
Dad, just go open some more cans.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,464
Okay, Mom, can we revisit
the 'blow off Thanksgiving' thing?

38
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,367
I mean, 'cause we kind of
made a choice to...

39
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:21,227
go to a party after the restaurant.
- On Thanksgiving?

40
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,837
Technically, it's an after-Thanksgiving
party. See, the Burgess family

41
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:26,041
eats real, real early and Amanda's
older brother is coming home from college

42
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,517
and he's bringing a bunch of friends home,
'cause they can't go home for the holidays

43
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:30,791
and Amanda gets to bring a few friends
too, you know, 'cause it makes it even.

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,701
So, Mom, it's a major coup
that Kerry even got invited,

45
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:36,745
and even though you think it's
just 'cause I'm her big sister,

46
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:39,982
but I have to say I think Kerry
finally made it on her own merits.

47
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:44,093
Yay, Kerry!
- Yay, me!

48
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:50,050
Well, you know girls, as proud of
you as I am... give me a break.

49
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:53,132
But, Mom, we already made
plans with Kyle and Luke.

50
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:56,625
Look, I'm sorry but... who's Luke?
- My safety bad boy.

51
00:02:56,715 --> 00:03:00,204
See, Damian's out of town and I just
don't want to be alone on the holidays.

52
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,625
Still 'no'.

53
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,332
Look, you guys, I put
a lot of effort into this.

54
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:07,643
I even have some surprises planned.

55
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:10,451
We're gonna have a fun
Thanksgiving. Just family.

56
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,234
Damn! I spilled it everywhere.

57
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,850
In theory.
- Fine. - Whatever.

58
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:22,957
The doorbell. Gee, I wonder who
that could be on Thanksgiving?

59
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:27,326
Don't you, Rory? - I don't know,
Mom. The Thanksgiving Bunny?

60
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:32,703
Hi, Tommy! What are you doing here?
Would you like to come in?

61
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,828
I don't have time
to come in now, Cate.

62
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,716
Because I'm heading down to
the stadium to see the Lions game.

63
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:43,558
If only I had someone to take.

64
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:47,488
Some boy... I can't do it, Cate.
Come on kid, you coming or not?

65
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:51,346
You got tickets to the Lions game?
Oh, man! Thanks, Mom!

66
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:55,171
Tommy, thanks. - You're welcome.
That'll be two hundred bucks.

67
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:59,491
What am I saying? It's
Thanksgiving. One fifty.

68
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,383
Fine, on me.
But he buys his own beer.

69
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,911
That's going to be blue in the morning.

70
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,806
How much to take my dad?

71
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,043
Hey, girls, listen.

72
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:18,481
I sent Rory to the football game
because I wanted him to be happy.

73
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,385
And I want you to be happy, too. So...
- So you're gonna let us go to the party?

74
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,773
Thank you, Mom, thank you!
- Well, no.

75
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,479
But, you can invite Kyle and 'safety
bad-boy' to have dinner with us.

76
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,292
And guess who else is
joining us? Grandma!

77
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:34,253
This just... - ...keeps getting better
and better. Thank you, Mom!

78
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:36,566
Happy Thanksgiving.

79
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,054
God, are you out of your mind?
- No, no, here's the plan, okay.

80
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,293
We've got the guys in the house.
At the perfect moment

81
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:47,623
when Mom's in a good mood,
Luke will turn on his charm,

82
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:50,815
she'll gaze in his soulful puppy dog
eyes, and then she'll be mesmerized

83
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,042
and we are so at that party.

84
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,866
Okay, Bridget. Please stop
before you say "girlfriend".

85
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,432
I mean, this plan is...
- ...is all we've got. - Word.

86
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:15,375
Come on, third and goal.
Please god, it's third and goal.

87
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,527
The Lions versus the Packers.

88
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,040
Were you expecting the
Lions versus the Christians?

89
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,084
Come on, guys, I'm trying
to watch the game.

90
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,680
There's no game going on.
All I see are fireworks,

91
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:30,503
the giant scoreboard telling
us when to cheer. I mean...

92
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,960
What the hell was that?

93
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:38,196
I'm going to go get myself...
- Don't forget your diet.

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,903
...a carrot. I'm gonna go
get myself a carrot.

95
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:43,587
Before they stop selling them
at the half. Got it? - Got it.

96
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:50,084
You know, I was at the stadium all the
time with your father. - Yeah, me too.

97
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,944
Well, you're the man of
the house, now. - I am?

98
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,122
It's not just a saying.

99
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:59,576
All those women in your house,
and no one to keep an eye on 'em.

100
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,457
And your sisters, come on.

101
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:07,808
Look, see your dad knew that there
are a lot of creepy guys out there

102
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,567
who are just gonna pounce
on them like wolves.

103
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,836
Wow, I never thought of it like that.

104
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:18,581
Well not everyone is
sensitive like you or me.

105
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,238
Hey, look at the jugs on her.

106
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,184
Mom, it's so good to have you here.

107
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:34,437
Guess who sat next to me
on the plane? An Indian.

108
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:37,385
I mean, what are the
odds, on Thanksgiving,

109
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:39,975
that I would be sitting
next to an Indian?

110
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:46,138
Gram, it's 'Native American.
- Oh, God, you sound just like him.

111
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,712
You know what, Grandma, that was a great
story. How 'bout you finish your coffee...

112
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:53,576
Mom... let's get dinner going.
I'm just very hungry.

113
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:59,003
Hey, Dad. Guess who
decided to join us.

114
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,443
Jim. Hi, kiddo.
- Hey, Gram.

115
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,931
What kind of charade is this?
- What are you talking about?

116
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,182
This. Just because it's Thanksgiving

117
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:11,102
you think you can get your
mother and me to reconcile.

118
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,228
No, I don't.
- Good.

119
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,810
So, Rory, how was
the game? - Okay.

120
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,536
You're cooking?
- Don't act so surprised.

121
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,241
Like you've never seen me in
the kitchen before. - I haven't.

122
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,587
I mean, in all the years
we were married.

123
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:35,030
No wait, let me be fair.
No, never.

124
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,025
Cate, let me help.
That's what I came here for.

125
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:42,131
Sure, you fly in here one day,
it's easy to look like a hero.

126
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,769
Where were you this morning
when I was opening cans?

127
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,526
He opened cans?
- Alright, you two look,

128
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,286
if you wanna help just come help
me set the table. Come on, Dad.

129
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,812
God, they should be here
by now. - Who should?

130
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:00,281
Kerry, were you talking to someone?
- I didn't hear anybody.

131
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:04,618
Must be the wind. - Yeah,
blowing through your empty head.

132
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:09,571
Rory, everything you say to me
goes in one ear and out the other.

133
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:29,267
Hey. So you must be Luke.

134
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,471
Yeah. Is Bridget here?

135
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:34,324
So, I see you got
a motorcycle. - Yeah.

136
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:38,076
Bet you get a lot of ladies
with it. - I do all right.

137
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:41,616
So, is... is Bridget here?
- Right, I have a message for you

138
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:45,080
from your precious Bridget.
'Thanks for the mono!'

139
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,921
Mono? No, I don't have mono.

140
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:52,363
Well then her message is,
'Sorry I gave you mono.

141
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:56,752
Oh, man. Now, I gotta
make a lot of calls.

142
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,568
Child's play.

143
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,214
I didn't know you made a pumpkin pie.

144
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:11,173
Actually, Dad made that.

145
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,053
Your dad?

146
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,223
Yeah, you know, actually, Mom,

147
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,695
ever since you separated,
he's been doing a lot of things

148
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,847
that are really uncharacteristic.

149
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:27,129
Like doing laundry and not
smoking in the bathtub.

150
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:29,731
That's nice.

151
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,491
He's seeing someone, isn't he?

152
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,464
No! Why, Mom, do you care?

153
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,425
No! Of course I don't care.

154
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,865
Has he been whistling? Because
that's a sure sign he's getting some.

155
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,517
Ma, just so you know, I
will never be old enough

156
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:51,701
for us to have this conversation.

157
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,623
Rory, you're gonna build a fire.

158
00:09:56,734 --> 00:10:00,187
It's a little cold in here.
- Yeah. - Atta boy.

159
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,989
Are you sure you opened the flue?
- Yes, Grandpa, I'm sure.

160
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,436
I watched my dad make
fires all the time.

161
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,527
You're using a starter log?
Sort of cheating, isn't it?

162
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:16,273
Yeah, well... fire's come a
long way since your day.

163
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,457
Yeah, you know what
else we had in my day?

164
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,640
A leather strap and a woodshed.

165
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,968
So Luke's not here yet?
- No. He hasn't shown up.

166
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:31,581
I don't know what
happened to him. - God.

167
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:34,240
Now we're going to be
stuck here all night.

168
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:38,931
Our plan has gone awry.
- 'Awry'?

169
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,510
Yeah, I know big words, too.

170
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,703
You make the fire. - No, you
make it. - No, you make it.

171
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:47,850
No... alright, I'll make it.
- Fine.

172
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,435
Kerry, honey,

173
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:04,455
would you go get your
grandpa a nice sweater?

174
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:10,314
Hey. - Hey, Kyle,
what are you doing here?

175
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:13,571
Oh, Kerry called me and invited
me over for a little turkey.

176
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:16,739
And then when Luke gets here, we're
gonna sneak out over to Amanda's party.

177
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,494
How awesome is that?
- Pretty awesome.

178
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,368
Wanna go toss the football?
- Sure.

179
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,946
Go long! Longer! Longer!

180
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:40,607
Wow, I didn't think that was possible.

181
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:47,639
Hey, have you seen Kyle? - Yeah, he's
about two blocks away, waving his arms.

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,580
What? - I threw him out.
- Rory Hennessey, I am gonna kill you!

183
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:55,022
What did he do to you? - Shannon told
Jenna told Courtney from first period...

184
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:57,784
not Courtney from gym class because Shannon
and Courtney from gym class hate each other,

185
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,245
because Shannon innocently pointed out that
Courtney's boobs are two totally different.

186
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:07,218
in front of someone who blabs, well, me...
that you told Luke that I had mono!

187
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:10,826
What's this about mono?
- Well, this little slug

188
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:14,250
threw both of our boyfriends out even
though they were officially invited!

189
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:17,782
They were gonna sneak out! - Can somebody
please tell me what happened?

190
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:22,359
Well, Jenna told Shannon who
told Courtney... - Mom!

191
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:27,807
We have to fix this now.
- No, no. You're not going anywhere!

192
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:30,108
We're gonna have dinner
in a few minutes! Fix what?

193
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:32,309
The girls are scamming us, Cate.

194
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,920
What did you just call me?

195
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,209
Jim, don't just sit there. Help.
- Money, money. Who wants money?

196
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,152
No, no, we don't do that here.

197
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,916
We'll just hook up with them after
we eat turkey. - Hook up with who?

198
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:49,439
Wait a minute. Shouldn't we be
smelling turkey right now? - God.

199
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:55,210
Oh, this thing is nowhere near done.

200
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,418
Alright, we're not having dinner
for another couple of hours.

201
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,572
A couple of hours?
We don't have a couple of hours!

202
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:01,818
Yes you do.
Family meeting!

203
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:04,690
What? Forget you and
your stupid family meeting!

204
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,832
Alright, now that is enough!

205
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,615
Now, all I wanted was a nice
Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.

206
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,988
Is that too much to ask?
- Don't worry, Cate.

207
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,981
I'll handle the girls. - What?
- Back me up on this.

208
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:19,500
Alright. Everybody out of here,
I need to talk to Rory.

209
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,628
Did you see how they
speak to me? - Sit.

210
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:31,359
Alright, what is going on
with you and your sisters?

211
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:36,724
Come on.
- I was trying to protect them.

212
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,572
Well that's sweet. - I was afraid they
were going to turn into big fat whores.

213
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:52,378
Okay, not so sweet.
How come?

214
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:57,924
Well, at the football game, Tommy said
I was the man of the house. - So?

215
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,267
Well, when Dad used to cover the
Tigers' away games when I was little,

216
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:06,133
he'd always say, 'While I'm gone,
Ror, you're the man of the house.

217
00:14:06,342 --> 00:14:08,948
But he'd always come back
and I'm just afraid that

218
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,843
if I don't fill his shoes, the girls are
gonna turn into big, fat... - I know...

219
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,798
I know.

220
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:22,010
Honey, your job is to be
a fourteen-year-old kid

221
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:24,340
and kind of a pain in the ass.

222
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,801
I can do that.
- You're great at that.

223
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,794
Don't take on this responsibility.

224
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:34,809
You're the son.
I'm the parent.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,020
I'll handle the girls.

226
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,661
So... as a parent who has it 'handled',

227
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:43,568
you do realize that while
we're having this touchy-feely

228
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:48,503
mother-son moment, the girls snuck out
to Amanda's party. - Right.

229
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:03,248
Momma H in the house!

230
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:08,849
We'll just be in the other room

231
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,709
having a non-alcoholic beverage.
- Thanks a lot, guys.

232
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:18,541
I can't believe that you girls would
pull a stunt like this on Thanksgiving.

233
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,227
I have been in that kitchen
all day preparing dinner,

234
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,481
your Grandma flew in from Florida,

235
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:26,800
and your Grandpa even made a pie.

236
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:30,954
I told you, you weren't going
to this party! - We know, Mom.

237
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,741
But don't you understand?
This is the first Thanksgiving...

238
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:36,625
I don't care that this
is the first Thanks...

239
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,134
Alright, look,

240
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,843
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

241
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:49,864
I've been doing my best today,

242
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,102
but this is no picnic for me either.

243
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,306
The truth is I don't
know what I'm doing.

244
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,332
I'm just making this up as I go along.

245
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:03,555
And something just tells me
that the right thing to do

246
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:08,228
is for us to have dinner in our home at
our dining room table, with our family,

247
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:13,295
even if this is the first
Thanksgiving without your father.

248
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:19,255
That was really nice, Mom.

249
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:22,452
But what I was gonna say was...

250
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:28,724
this is the first Thanksgiving that I
actually got invited to Amanda's party

251
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:33,417
and I really want to be here.
- Yeah. Me, too.

252
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:38,033
But, Mom, what you said
was really beautiful.

253
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:48,236
Mom, why are you laughing?

254
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:51,924
Mom, you're losing it.
In front of our college friends.

255
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,289
All I wanted was to have
a normal Hennessy Thanksgiving.

256
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:59,067
And I just realized I got it.

257
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:02,404
With my teenage daughters trying
to ditch me to go to a party.

258
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,506
What could be more normal?

259
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:10,427
I'm so glad we could
make it so special.

260
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:15,438
Well, bye.

261
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,587
Oh, no. You're grounded.

262
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,063
Now, get your things, let's go.
And hurry up or I'll embarrass you.

263
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:37,876
Bridget, Kerry...
sorry I ruined your plans.

264
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:44,647
Dance, monkey, dance.

265
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:49,209
Girls, let go of him. - God, how
much product do you use?

266
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,622
Alright, come on. everybody help me
get into the dining room. Come on.

267
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:03,354
What?

268
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:08,970
Dad, you're whistling.
- I'm happy.

269
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:19,196
Your mother wants to know if
you guys are ready to eat.

270
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,850
Since it's only eight o'clock
at night, I wasn't sure.

271
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,660
Dad?
- Yeah, what honey?

272
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:29,032
It's going to get easier, right?
- That's what I'm hoping.

273
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:33,048
Yeah, I just want to get all these
'firsts' over as fast as possible.

274
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,775
Well, you got a lot of
firsts to look forward to.

275
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,889
You got the first graduation.
The first wedding.

276
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:41,578
The first grandchild... provided
that comes after the first wedding.

277
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,956
You know, Dad, you turned
out to be a pretty great guy.

278
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,575
Here comes your mother.
Say that again.

279
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:55,222
I hope everyone's worked up an
appetite. - This just looks wonderful.

280
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:58,587
Thanks for going to all this trouble.
- Honey, it was no trouble.

281
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,579
In fact, your father actually helped
me. He opened a few cans.

282
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,678
I've been working on myself.
- I'll say.

283
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:10,991
It turned out to be a pretty
good Thanksgiving after all.

284
00:19:11,674 --> 00:19:13,712
Grandma's touching grandpa's cheek.

285
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:17,551
Three kinds of potatoes! Anyone
heard of Atkins in this family?

286
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:20,613
Did you know the human body has
twenty-seven feet of intestines?

287
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:24,189
I plan to fill every inch of them.
- Gross. - Gross, Rory.

288
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,964
Well, Dad, here you go.

289
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,906
Rory? Would you do the honor?

290
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,146
Rory! Stop it! - Come on, we have
enough! - Rory, come on!

291
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,934
Rory, you missed a little
on this side. - Rory!
