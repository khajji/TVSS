1
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,388
Okay, your sister's gone.
The kids are all upstairs.

2
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:11,692
So the pregnancy test is yours?

3
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:15,623
Yeah. I took the test and
it was negative and then...

4
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:19,692
You got me so excited there thinking
I was going to be a father again.

5
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:23,761
Well, then, my body still didn’t feel
right, so I rearranged the furniture.

6
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:29,207
Oh, yeah. It looks nice. I
like this flow you got here.

7
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:33,222
No, no…Paul, you don’t understand.
I took it again and it was positive.

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,643
What? How could this happen?

9
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:38,285
How could this happen? Well,
you see, Paul, you know,

10
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,300
a man and a woman fall
in love and at some point...

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,329
I know how it happens.
Hey, honey, listen…

12
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,540
if your body's going
through weird things,

13
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,242
maybe it’s just that
you're going through men…

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,623
…men… many different
things, my child.

15
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:54,481
Cate, look, it’s just that, you
know, I'm trying to write my book

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,020
and the column isn't catching fire.

17
00:00:57,397 --> 00:01:00,637
And it's just really a bad time
right now for me to have a baby.

18
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,515
Oh, well… how ‘bout if
I carried it for you?

19
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:08,805
This is the worst thing
in the whole world!

20
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:10,810
Bridget, you shouldn't
be eavesdropping!

21
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,831
So your mother
may be pregnant...

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,976
There it is. 'High School
Scandal Dot Com.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,076
'Bridget Hennessy is so five
minutes ago.' Oh my god!

24
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,448
Bridget, you don’t
read this stupid stuff.

25
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:26,043
Oh my gosh, and it says, 'Look at
her sister? She's so right now.'

26
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:29,214
It does? Oh my god, this is so...

27
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:32,838
Wait a minute. Mom, you're pregnant?

28
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:36,852
Mom, you're pregnant?

29
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:41,794
Wow, I can't believe
this. Kerry's popular.

30
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,528
#8 SIMPLE RULES FOR DATING
MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER#

31
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,589
Mom's pregnant?

32
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,723
I'm too young to be a grand sister!

33
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:10,011
Wow. I must be like super smart.

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,325
Hello! - Kids, your mother
and I need to discuss

35
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,505
Our mother and you have done
enough, thank you very much, mister.

36
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,672
Family meeting!

37
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,297
You can't call… wait a minute!

38
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,277
How come each time I call a
family meeting... fine, go ahead.

39
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:26,443
Alright, this meeting is in order.

40
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:28,456
Have you no self control, father?
Can't you keep it zipped?

41
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,433
Hey!

42
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,042
Yeah, I can't believe you two
are having unprotected sex.

43
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:37,350
Unprotected sex.
- Hey!

44
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,889
I mean, how would you like it if I
came home and said I was pregnant?

45
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:42,513
Honey, it's a little bit
different, and let me tell you why…

46
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,091
Tell you why.
- Stop it.

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,140
Paul, you had to get him a guitar?

48
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,326
You want the monkey back.

49
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,811
I can't believe my
mother may be pregnant.

50
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,213
I mean, I'm seventeen. When
the baby's my age, I'll be

51
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,703
Dancing around a pole?

52
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,845
Unpopular and a pregnant mother!

53
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,351
My life is so totally over.

54
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,657
Donny?
- Hang up. Hang up.

55
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,936
Donny, I have to go. My
dad got my mom in trouble.

56
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,676
No. You hang up first.

57
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,659
No, you!
You.

58
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,895
Okay, we'll count to
three and hang up together.

59
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:20,476
One... two... three...
No, you hang up first.

60
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,562
Give me that! That’s
it, give me the phone.

61
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:26,586
Donny, goodbye. No,
you hang up first. No

62
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,818
Can we focus please?

63
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,885
Now, your mother is not
necessarily pregnant.

64
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,576
Paul, and I'm not
necessarily not pregnant.

65
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:40,533
You know, when you're pregnant
your breasts get bigger.

66
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,258
Kyle, what are you doing here?
- I came by to see Kerry.

67
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,383
First Bridget, now Kerry.

68
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,068
Kyle, what are your
intentions with my daughters?

69
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:53,701
I can't tell you that.
You're the father.

70
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:59,681
Okay, okay! Not by the belt loops.
I'm going commando.

71
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:05,220
Fred. Mary Ellen.
- Ahoy, me bucko!

72
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,720
We just wanted to bring a
bundt cake over, now that…

73
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:11,215
well, what with Donny and Bridget
going steady we’re practically

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,872
People who live across the street.

75
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,638
Mrs. Hennessy's pregnant.
- Might be. I might be.

76
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:21,417
What? A Hennessy 'bundt' in the oven?

77
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,525
I swear, it's like
living with Dick Cavett.

78
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:26,773
Oh, some guys have all the luck.
- Oh dear! Oh dear!

79
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:30,411
Cake’s on the porch! - Thank you.
- Look, may I say something?

80
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:33,011
You might try saying 'no'
once in a blue moon, missy.

81
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:38,138
Alright, look… I am gonna get a
definitive test at the hospital tomorrow.

82
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:41,863
Kerry, are those my earrings?

83
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:45,085
What are you talking about?
- They are my earrings!

84
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,272
Okay, first you steal my
popularity and then my earrings!

85
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,373
You forgot about your boyfriend.

86
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:53,031
Chick fight! Chick fight,
chick fight, chick fight.

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,317
And you want to add to this brood?
- Me?

88
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:01,068
That’s enough. Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up on the couch.

89
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,366
And you stop it! Stop it!
- You broke my earrings!

90
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:05,643
Stop fighting or I'm going
to turn this car right around!

91
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,653
Paul, we're in the living room. - It's
a saying. - It's a saying in a car.

92
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,148
Hemingway said it all the time.
- No, he didn't.

93
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,202
I thought we agreed not to make me
look stupid in front of the kids?

94
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:21,237
This is a madhouse. I'm supposed
to bring a baby into this madhouse?

95
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,477
Good morning.

96
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:36,986
I said, ‘Good morning.’ What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

97
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,511
I say, ‘I may be pregnant.’ and
you say, 'How could this happen?'

98
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:44,664
But I just lost my baby
weight from the last one.

99
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:47,545
Honey, I know exactly what happened.

100
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,566
It went a little something like this…

101
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,414
You gotta get a new voice.

102
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,471
What are you doing? - I'm surprising
Mom with breakfast in bed.

103
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,248
And I made her a card...
- And I made her a card.

104
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:08,405
You are such a girl.
Our little sister Rory.

105
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:12,341
Hey, she seemed pretty ticked off
last night. I'm just saving my butt.

106
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:15,772
No! Hey! Hey! No!

107
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:23,455
Surprise!

108
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:47,519
Bridget would you please pass the milk.
- You don't deserve milk.

109
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,785
You could've knocked!
- It's seven in the morning!

110
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:54,016
I thought you couldn't do anything
until you had your first cup of coffee?

111
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:58,964
Yeah. I mean, there's
already one baby.

112
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:01,038
What were you trying to do,
make twins?

113
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,239
Yeah… that's how it happens.

114
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,293
Alright, you guys, knock it off.

115
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,392
Now look, I am sorry
that you walked in on us.

116
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,396
But you are just gonna
have to accept the fact

117
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:16,550
that your father and
I are sexual beings!

118
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,386
Come on, kids… knock it off.

119
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,484
Don’t you see your mother’s
going through a pregnancy scare?

120
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,705
Oh, so now it's a scare? Which
apparently I'm going through alone.

121
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:30,572
Now, you guys are amazing. You are
totally self centered. Unbelievable.

122
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:33,788
Good bye!

123
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,372
Looks like we won’t be walking
in on you two any time soon.

124
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:10,751
Bridget.

125
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:13,155
Hey, Bridget.

126
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,773
It’s, um… it's not what it looks like.

127
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,368
There's just a lot of societal pressure
on me to be all over your sister.

128
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,631
Well, I don’t have any time to convo,

129
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,676
I have to call my older
boyfriend who’s in college.

130
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:32,912
Hi, is Midshipman Donny
Doyle there? Donny!

131
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,958
Hey, Bridget.

132
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:38,782
Donny, you miss me, don’t you?

133
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,866
Of course I do. I can't
get my mind off you.

134
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:44,768
In fact, I was thinking about
you so much during chess club,

135
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,625
I opened up with a Polish
Gambit Accepted, when I should've

136
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:51,852
opened up with a Polish
Gambit Denied. I mean… 'Duh.'

137
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:57,891
Chess club? Donny, you're cool
at Naval college, aren't you?

138
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:01,190
Are you kidding? I'm way cool.

139
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,950
Hey! Doyle's got a girlfriend!

140
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:09,534
Shut up! You got a girlfriend!
Bridget, I gotta go.

141
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,376
The new kid.

142
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:55,866
The new kid.
- The new kid.

143
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,616
Pudding.

144
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,940
This pudding sucks.

145
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,381
This pudding sucks!

146
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,426
Hey.

147
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:43,445
There’s something you should
know: I have a boyfriend

148
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:47,220
already, he's in Navy College,
and he can do the Polish Gambit.

149
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:51,926
I was gonna say, 'Pass the salt.'

150
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,271
Pudding. Mmm.

151
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:02,310
Sometimes… all you
need is a little spice.

152
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:06,201
That's deep.
- No.

153
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:11,593
No, it's wide. If I went
deep, you couldn't find me.

154
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,436
What does that mean?

155
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,981
I don't know.

156
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,903
I'm Bridget.
- Damian.

157
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:36,540
There's something you should know,
I'm kind of an outcast right now.

158
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:40,491
I’m thinking about buying a motorcycle.

159
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,589
Hennessy!

160
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,797
Just the man I wanna see.
How would you like to turn...

161
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:52,727
Tommy, I'm having a bad day.
- Poor me. You're having a bad day.

162
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,161
I'm on sexual harassment probation
thanks to what’s her name…

163
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,412
'Boobs' in reception.

164
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,326
Listen… how would you like
to turn five hundred bucks

165
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:04,341
into three thousand dollars
by Monday morning?

166
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,963
Tom. - It’s guaranteed.
- Tommy, no.

167
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:11,826
What's wrong, pal?
- Oh, hey, Paul. - Fred?

168
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,747
Hey, the receptionist with
the big front porch sent me up.

169
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,693
Hey, you look like a smart
fella. How’d you like to turn

170
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,684
Tommy! - Okay.
- Sit down, Fred. - Oh, thank you.

171
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:23,056
Is there any special
reason you’re dropping by?

172
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,247
Well, I kinda read between
the lines last night,

173
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:27,443
when you slammed the door in our faces.

174
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:29,522
I’m so sorry, Fred, I...
- No problem.

175
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,949
Yeah, I kinda sensed your stress,

176
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,817
well what with you and Cate and your
impending fatherhood potentiality.

177
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,038
Well, nothing’s, nothing's for sure.

178
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:39,028
Yeah, I know. Well, I
picked up on that too.

179
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:41,230
Fred, I don’t really need...
- You see, me and Mary Ellen,

180
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,883
well, we can't have kids of our own.

181
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:47,174
I had no idea. All
your kids are adopted?

182
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,509
Yeah. Yeah. We…

183
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:52,675
…we think Donny's a Kennedy.

184
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,729
I just came down to tell you
that I think you're a good father.

185
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,665
Yeah, I've seen you.

186
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,594
And besides, you're not
in this alone, you know.

187
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,886
You and, you and Cate
are in it together.

188
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,489
Two peas in a pod, as it were.
Listen, I better shove off, boy and oh,

189
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,465
yeah… if you’re finished with the
cake, Mary Ellen would like her pan back.

190
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,504
Oh my god, Cate and
I are in this together

191
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,828
and I've only been
thinking about myself.

192
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:22,284
My career, my stupid book, my finances.

193
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,754
I feel as if I’ve let her down
and that's not what a husband does.

194
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:27,118
Don’t be so hard on yourself, Paul.

195
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:30,691
You and I are terrific
husbands. Hey, wanna get drunk?

196
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:33,088
Come on, you and me and Carla.
- Who?

197
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:36,078
‘Jugs’ in reception.
But you gotta ask her.

198
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:08,452
Okay, stop it! What are you laughing
at “Mr. Mom Still Cuts My Hair?”

199
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,417
And you, “Nose Job Over The Summer.”

200
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:12,346
And don't even get me started,
“Girl Who Farted During

201
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,456
Crunches In Gym Class.”
Get out of here, good bye!

202
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:24,153
I'm so embarrassed.

203
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,261
I’m never gonna get the hang
of these heels... or popularity.

204
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:29,676
Oh, come on… stop it.
Here, just take my shoes.

205
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:34,428
They're too big.
- Thanks. Just take 'em, seriously.

206
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:37,404
Shuffling is sexier than falling.

207
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,472
Bridge, why are you being nice to me?

208
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:42,492
I don’t know. 'Cause
you're my sister and…

209
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:45,714
… you're the only sister I'll ever have.

210
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,957
God, how many times
has Mom said that to us?

211
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:52,437
Mom.

212
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:56,297
Well, Mom’s gonna need a new
catchphrase. We may have a baby sister.

213
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,190
Yeah, maybe you guys can share shoes.

214
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,395
This is really big for her.

215
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:04,327
I know. And all we've been doing
is thinking about ourselves.

216
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:07,992
We were really mean.
- God, how could we be so selfish?

217
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:10,301
I blame Mom.

218
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,944
Mom.

219
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:23,718
Yoo hoo… Cate.

220
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:26,628
Mary Ellen... you're here…

221
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,248
… volunteering on my day.

222
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:34,248
Oh, pish tosh. Now, I know you’re a
little stressed about this baby thing.

223
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:38,357
A little? I don't know if
I can be a mother again.

224
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:41,082
I've been so upset with my
family I haven't even had

225
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:45,660
time to think about what I
want. I just got my career back.

226
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:50,150
Paul is not in the best
place and… but, you know,

227
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:54,219
I miss them when they're
little. I don't know.

228
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:57,382
Hey, Cate, the lab called
and your pee's on deck.

229
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:01,370
Oh God. - I never thought that
I could handle more than one...

230
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,399
Mary Ellen, I really...
- And then, before we knew it

231
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:06,033
we had five when
we adopted Mary Maureen.

232
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,602
And I have to tell you
I love them all,

233
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:12,131
and I wanna say to you
that somehow it works out.

234
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,606
I didn't know little
Mary Maureen was adopted.

235
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,714
Yes. They're all adopted.

236
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:22,012
Fred. Insanity in the family.

237
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:24,959
Yeah, you know, I really do...

238
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:29,126
Cate… what I’m trying to
say is, no matter what happens,

239
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,248
it’s all going to be okey dokey.
Well, I've bothered you enough.

240
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,563
Mary Ellen?

241
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:42,185
Would you wait with me?

242
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,499
Sure.

243
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:56,024
Are you finished with my cake pan?

244
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:02,097
Alright, everybody, family meeting.

245
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,798
On the couch. Right now.

246
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:11,113
Now, listen to me. Your mother is the
most wonderful woman on the planet.

247
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:15,108
She kills herself for this family.
She is the salt of the earth.

248
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:18,171
Salt.

249
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,666
And all of us

250
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:24,450
…and all of us have been horrible
to her these past twenty four hours.

251
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,428
Yeah, we know, Dad. - I know.
- You're right. Dad.

252
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,318
So, I was thinking… I’m right? You
never say I'm right. So anyway

253
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,735
I got her these presents.

254
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,931
Bridge, you're the chocolates.

255
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:37,177
And you're the Teddy Bear.

256
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,791
You're the pencil
with the fuzzy eraser.

257
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,473
What? - Dad, you must have
gathered all the change

258
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,777
from under the
car seats for this stuff.

259
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,929
Don't worry about it, I'm
giving her the big one.

260
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,710
It's a giraffe.
- Don't name it!

261
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,979
A giraffe!

262
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,264
Hi, guys.

263
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,887
Mom. - Mom...
- We are so sorry.

264
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:13,138
Oh, hi… hi, honies. - Mom, we really
want you to have this baby.

265
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:15,504
Yeah, so long as it's not a boy.
- That's very generous of you, but

266
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,501
And we'll do everything we can to help.
We'll baby sit it.

267
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,468
We’ll change it.
- Change it… hello! French manicure,

268
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,734
I ain’t changing it. You gotta…
- Why do I always have to do everything?

269
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,538
Now, girls - I’m not changing
- Girls. - Mom.

270
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:27,901
I felt bad about this
morning, so I wrote you a song.

271
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,425
Unplanned baby.

272
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,935
Welcome to the family.

273
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:40,171
Rory, Rory. Honey, that’s
so sweet. Thank you.

274
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,186
Thanks to all my kids.

275
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,803
I bought all the presents,
the kids didn't even chip in.

276
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,820
I’m kidding, Cate. Come here.

277
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,847
Come here. I just want you to know…

278
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:54,185
that I love you and I am so sorry
for the way I was behaving and…

279
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:57,559
I want you to know that I
really, really want this child.

280
00:18:57,588 --> 00:19:01,931
And look at this. I even
got the baby’s first gift.

281
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:04,755
That’s so nice. Thank you.

282
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,936
Thanks everybody.

283
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:10,804
But, I'm not pregnant.

284
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,315
No? - No?

285
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,326
No?
- No...

286
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,726
Shut up.
- Why are you hitting me for?

287
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:21,108
Take it upstairs! Kids!
Right now, go upstairs.

288
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,876
Right now! Take it upstairs!

289
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:28,846
Nice giraffe.

290
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,952
Yeah, you know, giraffes
are gender neutral.

291
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:35,114
So it doesn't matter
if it's a boy or a girl.

292
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,658
So... not pregnant?

293
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,791
Nope.
- How do you feel?

294
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:50,050
I don’t know.

295
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:53,679
You little twerp, you like
totally scuffed my shoes!

296
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,051
Tell you why! - Yeah, but you
broke mine, you big foot!

297
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,541
Let go of me!
- Get off of me!

298
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:01,124
Stop it.
- So, not pregnant!

299
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:08,484
I gave my love a cherry,

300
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,924
that had no stone.

301
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:16,895
I gave my love a chicken,
that had no...

302
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,620
