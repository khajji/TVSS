1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:04,393
Fred and Mary Ellen Doyle.

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:06,531
Just wanted to see if we
could pop by for a few…

3
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:10,570
Hey, neighbor, Fred
Doyle here… Hey, neighbor…

4
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:14,317
You know, you could
return one of Fred s calls.

5
00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:16,707
Okay, I can't talk to
you when you're like this.

6
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,957
The man, he can't take a hint.

7
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:21,152
He would still keep calling
here if we changed our

8
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:23,790
outgoing message to Doyle,
you idiot, stop calling!

9
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:27,381
Hey, neighbor.

10
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:34,344
Well… hello. Fred, Mary Ellen…
we were just talking about you.

11
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:39,326
You lie! - Yes, we were. We used your names
and everything. Rory, say hi to the Doyles.

12
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:42,374
Sorry to burst in like
this. We tried calling but

13
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:45,750
something must be wrong with
your answering machine. - Yes, well...

14
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:49,016
you know, we haven t been able
to receive any incoming messages at all.

15
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,734
Something s wrong with the
answering machine? - Rory! No! No!

16
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:55,442
Hey, neighbor, Fred Doyle and
Mary Ellen Doyle… - You fixed it!

17
00:00:57,743 --> 00:01:00,535
It wasn t broke.
- I said you fixed it.

18
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:04,607
So, what can we do for you?
- We made Donny a video postcard.

19
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,236
He gets so lonely down
at the Naval Academy.

20
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,175
Yeah, nothing fancy, mind
you, just the whole family got

21
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:12,786
together to say hi and singing
a few tunes from Sound of Music.

22
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,845
So different. - That's, gee… yeah.

23
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:18,629
Yeah, anyway… we left a little
room at the end of the tape

24
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:21,944
so that Donny s best girl,
Bridget, could say Howdy do.

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,615
Now you tell Bridget she's under no
pressure to sing and dance on the tape.

26
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:29,866
Donny understands
that'she's not a Doyle.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,402
Yet.

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,646
She can do those things, right? - Yes.

29
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:40,262
You sure? - Okay then, well, listen, thank
you so much for stopping by, you guys.

30
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,129
We'll see you later,
alright? Okay. Bye-bye.

31
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:45,440
Wait a minute…
what am I thinking here.

32
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:49,199
On a more somber note, there is a crime
wave presently in our neighborhood.

33
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,422
No. Burglaries? - Eggings.

34
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,492
Yeah. Yeah… the Feeneys, the O Tooles,

35
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:59,466
the Johnsons have all taken the yolk.

36
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:04,671
And this guy keeps changing his
M.O. shaving cream, toilet paper.

37
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:08,869
No, where will this madman stop? - Yeah.

38
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,431
Exactly, so as Captain of the Neighborhood
Watch, I wanted to ask you, Paul…

39
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,621
Fred, listen you know
that I would love to join

40
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,691
the Watch and go on patrol with you guys

41
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:22,352
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie, look… you're
far too valuable behind a typewriter.

42
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,462
See, what this malcontent
needs is a, is a nickname.

43
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:28,480
Something we can put in the
local paper to raise awareness.

44
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,334
Coming up with a name
should be a snap for you.

45
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,523
You mean, something like
The Michigan Mischief Maker?

46
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:36,710
Boy, you writers are amazing.
- It's nothing.

47
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,504
Boy, to come up with just
the right turn of phrase you

48
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,991
must have to wade through
a million stinkers like that?

49
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,404
You got grit. He's got grit,
Mary. He's the grittiest.

50
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:07,436
Hey, Bridge, can I borrow
your go-go boots to go with

51
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,572
this skirt for that'sixties
party everyone s going to?

52
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:12,350
What'sixties party?

53
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:16,513
Just some lame party, I'm totally
gonna blow it off... in your boots.

54
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:21,295
Alright, Kerry, listen… you
don't have to protect my feelings.

55
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,673
When I was the popular one, I went
to millions of really cool parties,

56
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:29,424
I never even told you about…
because they were really lame.

57
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,248
Hello. Damian. Shut up.

58
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,338
I hate you. Okay, see you then.

59
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,840
Damian? - Yes, that really hot new
senior with the homemade tattoos.

60
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,203
We had this secret date, and oh
my God, he's such a good kisser.

61
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:52,579
Except when his tongue ring
caught one of my fillings.

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,053
Bridget, what about Donny Doyle?

63
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,810
Thank you for making me think
of Donny. Now, I feel guilty.

64
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:01,096
Well, you should feel guilty.
He's your boyfriend and when he

65
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,538
finds out you're two-timing
him, you're gonna wind up alone.

66
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,734
He's in Maryland. How s he
ever going to find that out?

67
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:11,309
Damian, I told you I d meet… It's Donny?

68
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:16,264
You have reached Bridget s voice mail.

69
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:19,200
Please leave a message. Beep!

70
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,554
Bridge, he's not gonna fall for…
- He's leaving a message.

71
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,647
That was so close. What if
I'm not always that clever?

72
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,834
It is a high level to maintain.
- You re right.

73
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:35,924
I am so gonna get caught. You know, I
have to choose between one or the other.

74
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:38,138
One or the other what?
- Yeah, Bridge, what?

75
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,373
You know, Kerry, if you wanna
borrow my boots, they re upstairs

76
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:43,707
in the box marked, shut up. - Got it.

77
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,952
What was that about? - Dad, did
you ever have to choose between...

78
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,461
two things that you really,
really liked? - Indeed I did.

79
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:54,598
As a young man about to embark on life's
journey, I was faced with a dilemma…

80
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,698
Hi, how ‘bout Cliff Notes?

81
00:04:56,917 --> 00:05:00,017
Okay, well, when I graduated college
I had to make a decision whether

82
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:03,323
or not I was gonna go to law school,
as I always planned, or become a writer.

83
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:05,619
Which did you choose?

84
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:15,120
Anyway, Bridge, what I'm trying
to say is: follow your heart.

85
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,260
I followed my heart and
I ve never looked back.

86
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,876
That's your advice, follow my heart?
- Well, it's not that'simple.

87
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,524
I can't believe I never thought of that!
I'mean, I'm always, like, so logical.

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,411
Bridget, hey, Bridget. The
Doyles brought this over for you.

89
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,054
They made Donny a video
letter and they left some

90
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,743
room at the end for a
message from his special girl.

91
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,991
You. - Right. Yeah.

92
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:43,592
So, Paul, I always thought that
you never got into Law School.

93
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:46,944
She asked for the Cliff Notes.

94
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:51,020
Anyway, Donny, it, looks like Grandma's
not gonna make it past Thanksgiving.

95
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:54,882
But, on the upside, you re
moving on up to the adult table.

96
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:58,770
Alright now, a very
special message to Donny

97
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,838
from Donny s little
sweetheart, Bridget Hennessy.

98
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:04,829
Perhaps The future Mrs. Donny Doyle?

99
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,832
Did I say that?

100
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:11,057
You re a bomb. Okay, hit
the ‘off button, honey.

101
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:15,685
Mary Maureen...
For the love of Mike.

102
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:20,859
Hey. How's Navy College? Not much going on
here, except I got these new sandals with

103
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:23,283
this really cute flower pattern, but
the first time I wore ‘em the strap

104
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:25,303
totally broke off. And when I brought
em back for a refund, they'd only give

105
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,988
me a store credit. I was all, Yeah,
like I wanna buy more of your defects.

106
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,407
And I think we should see other people. And
I totally understand if you wanna tell all

107
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:34,494
your Navy friends that you broke up
with me. Good luck at war and stuff. Bye.

108
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:40,595
Dude, I'm sorry. So, can I call her?

109
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,889
Hey, Cate, listen to this. I came up
with a couple names for this prankster.

110
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,963
Which do you like better The Lone Eggman

111
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:59,339
or The Neighbor-hoodlum?

112
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,711
Why don't you try something
like The Oakdale Vandal?

113
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:11,443
The Oakdale Vandal? Who's gonna
crack the case, the Hardy Boys?

114
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,623
You know, you're right, Paul.
The Lone Eggman is gold.

115
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,511
Fine, I'll just trust my own instincts.
Rory, what do you think?

116
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,648
I'm not going anywhere.
- No, which do you like better

117
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:27,261
The Neighbor-hoodlum
or The Lone Eggman?

118
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:31,167
Dad, both really capture the guy.
- I know.

119
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,775
But what about something like: The
Injustice Fighter or The Righteous

120
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:41,540
Avenger or: Operation: You Tenth
Graders Picked On The Wrong Guy?

121
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,330
That's too many words for a headline.

122
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,436
I'll get it.

123
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:59,268
Hey, what's wrong? - Donny.

124
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:02,200
Well, come in. What is it?

125
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:05,765
Something's happened at school. Donny…

126
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:09,190
Donny… Donny got a B.

127
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,931
Here come the waterworks.

128
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:17,155
Wait a minute, wait… you, you,
you re this upset over a B?

129
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,174
We don't expect you to understand.

130
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,948
We still care about our kids grades.

131
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:25,986
Hey! You know, we still
care about our… - I never

132
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,649
should have sent him that
blasted videotape letter!

133
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:31,068
Fred thinks something on it upset him.

134
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,663
He got the tape, he fell apart.

135
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:37,213
Mary Ellen, it's time to come clean.

136
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:42,123
When we sang Climb Every
Mountain... I sang Donny's part.

137
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,331
It was like I was
rubbing his nose in it:

138
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:48,514
You re gone, I'm the big
baritone around here, now, pal.

139
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,549
I'm nothing but a no-good
harmony part stealer.

140
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,472
Fred, I'm sure stealing a
harmony part isn't the problem.

141
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,414
What else could it be? - Well, Bridget
broke up with him on that videotape.

142
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,039
No, I thought everyone knew.

143
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,519
Your daughter… broke up with our Donny?

144
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:18,523
On our videotape? - You
took Donny s harmony part?

145
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,852
Well, see this? Little Bridgie
s behind Donny s downfall.

146
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,827
She enchanted him
with her feminine wiles,

147
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:32,406
and flaunted all her
what's-its and who-zits.

148
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:35,414
Wait just a minute here!
- Now, now, now… Fred, wait.

149
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:40,921
It's no one s fault. In fact, there may
be a silver lining to this whole mess.

150
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:45,153
Exactly. Maybe now Donny can
focus on his studies again.

151
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:50,157
Yes. Or maybe, Cate, you'll start
spending a little more time at home

152
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,782
before Kerry turns into a
boy-destroying hussy like her sister.

153
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,460
That's too late.

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,722
Who are you calling a hussy?
There is nothing wrong with the…

155
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,785
I can't defend that.

156
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,406
What, I told you that I'm going to
that'sixties party. Don't you ever listen?

157
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:13,562
Bold move there, Paul letting a ten
year old dabble in the summer of love.

158
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,689
I'm not ten! - Alright, Kerry.
Go upstairs. I'll handle this.

159
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,833
Look here, I am sorry
about Donny and Bridget.

160
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,983
But that does not mean
you can insult my family.

161
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,778
So, I am going to have to
ask you to leave this house.

162
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,478
Well… we re going.

163
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,502
But you will rue this day,
Hennessy, mark my words.

164
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:35,045
The eyes of the Neighborhood Watch
no longer will land upon your house!

165
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,054
No! How will we ever
survive without pudgy

166
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,756
middle-aged men with
walkie-talkies to protect us?

167
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,770
It's too bad Donny and Bridget
couldn't work it out. - Yeah.

168
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,050
The Doyles will probably
never talk to us again. - I know.

169
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,140
I feel like I should
buy Bridget something.

170
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:57,365
What was that? - What?

171
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,094
That. It's him. He's here! Who?

172
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,544
The Motown Disturber. Really?
I thought that's a keeper.

173
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,579
What should we do?
- I'll take care of it.

174
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,584
A toilet brush? Are you
going to scrub him to death?

175
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,689
Would you want to be touched with this?

176
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:34,511
Stop!
- You had enough? Had enough, punk?

177
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,183
Please, Mr. Hennessy. Mr. Hennessy,
I give. What, wait…

178
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,978
Donny? Donny, what are you doing here?

179
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,245
Look, I had to see Bridget.
I need to see her.

180
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:51,082
I'm desperate… oh, my God, Mr. Hennessy,
you beat me with a toilet brush?

181
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,001
Would you stick to the subject?
What happened to you?

182
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:58,636
I hitchhiked all the way here. But to
see Bridget again, I was happy to ride

183
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:01,311
in the back of that
truck with all those pigs.

184
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:05,186
Did that come from the
master bath or the girls bathroom?

185
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,067
What does that matter?
- You re right.

186
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:11,248
All that matters is seeing
Bridget and winning her back.

187
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,469
She's the whole reason I went AWOL.
- AWOL?

188
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,993
Donny, you re in the military.
This isn't just cutting class.

189
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,728
It's desertion. They,
they shoot people for that!

190
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:24,358
I don't care. I d gladly face a
thousand firing squads for Bridget.

191
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:27,404
I'm gonna have to call your parents.
- No, don't do that. They'll kill me.

192
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:30,030
No, wait. Come on now,
listen… You got pig smell.

193
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,178
I'm serious, Donny. You
have to get back to your

194
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,531
dorm before anyone notices
you ve gone ‘A ‘W ‘O ‘L.

195
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:42,457
Sir, I know I can make Bridget love me.

196
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,915
Then again, a long stretch in
the brig might do you some good.

197
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,726
Cate, he s not listening! Forget
it, I'll wait until you're off

198
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:51,015
the phone with the Doyles.
- Yeah, well they won t even notice.

199
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,952
They're on another crying jag.
I told ‘em about the pig truck.

200
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,032
Where do kids get this idea that
they're meant to be together?

201
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,253
Paul, he's young and hopelessly in love.

202
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,296
Don't you remember what that
was like? - No! Do you? - No.

203
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:07,649
But, but you pretend. - Right.

204
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:16,213
Okay… Donny, you and Bridget are

205
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,950
obviously meant to be together.

206
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:21,645
But if you obsess about
her, and, you know, break

207
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,356
into her home, she could
take it the wrong way.

208
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,529
You know, women, how they are.

209
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,029
So you re saying, if she sees me here, she
might think I'm a little pathetic and needy?

210
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,465
No, I'm saying that'she, along with
most courts, will think you're a stalker.

211
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,146
I gotta get back to Annapolis.

212
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,471
You know, that toilet
brush whoopin might

213
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,687
be the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

214
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:48,233
Thanks, Mr. Hennessy. - You betcha. - Donny,
your parents will be here any minute.

215
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,439
No. - Paul, you really pummeled him.

216
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:56,105
I feel bad.

217
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:00,495
Stop gloating. He
didn't even fight back.

218
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:03,366
Not after the ass-whippin I dished out.

219
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:09,147
Donny? My god, what are you doing here?

220
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:12,739
I am not a stalker…
or pathetic or needy.

221
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:16,543
You smell like a pig.
- Yeah, long story.

222
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,350
Bridget, I thought you were in bed.

223
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,054
I was studying.
- Without books?

224
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,675
Ever hear of the Internet? - The computer's
here. And you do not have a laptop.

225
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:30,027
And whose fault is that?
- Okay, alright, you two.

226
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:32,861
Look, before Bridget ends up
with a free laptop, why don't

227
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,269
you just show Donny where
we keep the antiseptic?

228
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,774
Alright, where is he?
- Now, Fred, your blood pressure.

229
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:47,460
Our boy s gone AWOL.
Somebody's in for a spanking!

230
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,887
Fred! Fred! - What?
- You wanna cinch that?

231
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,762
You were in a fight with my Dad?

232
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:01,341
Well, it wasn t so much a fight as a…
- That is so cool. - battle to the death.

233
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,353
Well, after Donny and I
had our little chat, I'm

234
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,628
pretty sure he s going
back to the Naval Academy.

235
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,966
Mom, Dad: I'm dropping out of
the Naval Academy. - You're what?

236
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:17,692
Bridget changed her mind. She's taking
me back! - Daddy, look at him.

237
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:20,310
He's just so... Edward Norton
in Fight Club right now.

238
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,869
Donny, you can't throw
everything away for

239
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:26,467
some girl who's not
even good enough for you!

240
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:30,430
Is it your life s mission to destroy me?

241
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:33,052
Robe.

242
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,081
Bridget's not good enough
to date Donny. Yeah, well

243
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,643
Donny's not good enough to date Bridget!

244
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:46,062
Maybe you should have
gone to law school. - Dad!

245
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,399
No, honey… I'm fine.

246
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:52,715
What is it, Kerry? - Here we are,
another morning talking about Bridget.

247
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:56,524
Honey, I know that's hard.
- No, no, she deserves the attention.

248
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:58,861
After all she does have
two boyfriends right now.

249
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:02,419
You guys think I care that nobody noticed
I snuck out and stayed out past curfew?

250
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:07,876
Back up a second. - Okay, it was
just a few minutes past curfew.

251
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,857
Not that. Bridget has two boyfriends?

252
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:14,064
God, no one is interested in me.

253
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,545
Honey, of course
we re interested in you.

254
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,788
What can you tell us about Bridget?

255
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,144
And what about this other boyfriend?
- Kerry, wait! - Wait! Kerry! Kerry!

256
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:27,409
We are really upset with you. You get
back here, right now! Who am I kidding.

257
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:32,533
This is unbelievable!
Donny drops out of school

258
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,663
to be with Bridget and
she's two-timing him.

259
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:37,219
Yeah, well we have to talk to her.
- Damn right, we re gonna talk to her.

260
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,464
You notice we never have
problems like this with the boy?

261
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:43,373
Bye, Dad. - See ya, son.

262
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:47,897
Yeah?

263
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:50,970
Bridget, you re going out with
Donny, and you have another boyfriend?

264
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,670
Yeah. Isn't it funny how
everything just worked out?

265
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:56,447
Do you, do you realize
that Donny s giving up his

266
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,692
dream of being in the Navy
to come here and be with you?

267
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,599
Meanwhile, tomorrow you
could just decide to dump him.

268
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,818
I can't believe you think I'm that fickle.
- Well, you did dump him yesterday.

269
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:08,103
That is so like you just to dredge
up the past. You know, the only

270
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,538
reason I broke up with him is because
you told me to follow my heart.

271
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,431
We were talking about law school!
Cate, you re here. Good.

272
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:18,016
Daddy thinks I'm fickle.
- Sweetheart… you are fickle.

273
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,122
Gang up on me. What is
this an intervention?

274
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:24,233
Bridget, you cannot do this to Donny.

275
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,641
Can't you see you're wrong?
You… Cate, tell her.

276
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,848
Look, Paul, we ve already
talked to her. She's a big girl.

277
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:31,226
She's gonna do what she's gonna do.
- Okay, you guys, look just,

278
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:34,054
stop worrying! Now that I'm going out with
Donny, I'm gonna break it off with Damian.

279
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,853
Well, if that's your final decision...
I'll just wait five minutes.

280
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:44,254
Bridge, Donny is risking everything
for you and you kind of like him.

281
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:46,620
You gotta let him go.

282
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,747
Would it kill you, for once in
your life, to listen to your dad?

283
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,274
I'm listening. I am listening.

284
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:54,930
Now, if you guys don't mind, I have a date
with Donny and this skirt is way too long.

285
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,570
Bridget!

286
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,561
Bridget will be right down. - Thanks.

287
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,748
So, have you decided? - Decided
what? - Hanging or firing squad?

288
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:15,849
Rory! - I'd go for hanging, it breaks
the neck, you don't feel a thing.

289
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,619
Get out! Get out!

290
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:21,564
Hey, Bridget.
- Hey, Donny.

291
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,676
You look so beautiful.
- Thanks.

292
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:27,612
I'm glad I dashed my
childhood dreams for you.

293
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,597
Oh my god! - You okay, Mr. Hennessy?
- Yeah, I'm fine. You have fun.

294
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,356
I have a great night planned. - Cool.

295
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:47,421
Actually, you know what,
Donny, I can't do this. - Do what?

296
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,123
You know, quitting Navy
College and risking hanging

297
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,446
is like the sweetest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

298
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:57,617
Thanks. - But, I d hate
to see you risk your

299
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:59,877
whole future just because
you re crazy over me.

300
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:05,340
I mean, I understand
it… but, god, I can't

301
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:08,582
believe I m saying this…
I may not be worth it.

302
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,273
But Bridget, you… - No, don't say anything.
Okay. My mind s made up.

303
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:15,957
But… - Donny, you have to go back
to school, okay. Here s your pin.

304
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,158
You back so soon?
- You were listening.

305
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,833
No, I was not listening.

306
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:41,743
And I am so proud of you. That was a
tremendous sacrifice you made, Bridget.

307
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,220
Well, you know, it was the right
thing to do. It was actually you, Dad.

308
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,961
I mean, you told me not to be selfish
cause I could be ruining his future.

309
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:50,052
You listened. I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

310
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,901
Besides, when he got all cleaned
up and the bristle marks faded,

311
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,338
he lost, like, half his hotness.
- No, stop right there. You listened.

312
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,085
You listened to your Dad! - Now,
he's not even nearly as hot as Damian.

313
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:00,743
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah! You
listened! - I m gonna call Damian.

314
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:08,239
You listened!

315
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:13,174
Hello? Anybody out there?
We re out of toilet paper.

316
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:19,141
Again! How could we possibly go
through a twenty pack in two days?

317
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,490
Is anyone out there? Please.

318
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,418
Alright, I hope
everybody read my column.
