1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:03,116
Max, can you watch my tables
while I run to the restroom?

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,352
I already am.

3
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:05,803
I've been watching model girl

4
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,489
pretend she's eating for 30 minutes.

5
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:09,691
Oh, she's nice.

6
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,594
She always tips
on what she would've eaten.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,864
Guess what, everyone?

8
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,332
I have a secret.

9
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,833
You're a woman trapped in a man's body?

10
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,084
No.

11
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,870
You're a man trapped in a woman's body?

12
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,421
You're a little boy

13
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,873
trapped in a little girl's body?

14
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,258
I am a man in a man's body.

15
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,628
We're not talking about your night life.

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,214
I have discovered something when going over

17
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,832
the employee applications.

18
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,136
Okay, perhaps I never worked
at the Waldorf Astoria,

19
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:42,006
but I did work with this guy,
Waldorf, in Astoria.

20
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,026
It's not you. Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday.

21
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:47,061
Why wouldn't I know that?

22
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:49,230
She tells me everything about her life.

23
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:50,648
I know so much about her cycle,

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,568
I'm feeling pressure to impregnate her.

25
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,321
I can do that for you.

26
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,572
It's weird.

27
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,691
Why wouldn't she want
to celebrate her birthday?

28
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,025
She celebrates everything.

29
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,911
Heads up, everybody.

30
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:04,829
I just refilled the paper towels.

31
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,767
Who's a team player? What, what?

32

Original air date

Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

37
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,089
Max.

38
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:25,724
You know what we have to do.

39
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:28,160
Aw, man. I knew this day would come.

40
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:33,148
All right, what's the least
amount I can do to keep my job?

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,767
Just tell me when it's over.

42
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,519
And when it starts.

43
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,555
It's time to talk about Caroline's birthday.

44
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:42,107
You have to throw her a party.

45
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,608
I'd rather you just

46
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,912
have your tiny way with me.

47
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:49,531
I don't like birthdays.
I don't even know when mine is.

48
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:53,785
My mom narrowed it down
to a two-week window in June.

49
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,673
But you are Caroline's BFF.

50
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,625
And it is BFF's job
to throw friend a party.

51
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:01,710
Han, I don't have enough money

52
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:03,011
to throw a party.

53
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:06,247
I don't even have enough money
to throw a baseball.

54
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,133
You have money. You be her BFF.

55
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:11,436
I already have a BFF-- Jamarcus.

56
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:13,055
And my last birthday,

57
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:15,474
he threw me a sick surprise party.

58
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:18,393
You must think BFF stands
for "barely freaking friends",

59
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,028
because there's no way you're down

60
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,563
with someone named Jamarcus.

61
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:22,647
Oh, really?

62
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:26,935
Then why did we exchange
ATM pin numbers?

63
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:29,771
Oh...

64
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,541
I'll just crop that, and we'll be good to go.

65
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:35,777
Max, Edwin's ready to show us
the design for our new website.

66
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,329
Come see it.

67
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,664
Dude, you and the webmaster
have been talking "business"

68
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,282
every day for a week.

69
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:42,501
Is something going on there?

70
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:45,303
Shouldn't the web be mastered by now?

71
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,339
It's strictly business.

72
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,508
All right, but it's costing us $200.

73
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,977
Might as well get something out of it.

74
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:56,631
Maybe let him browse your Yahoo?

75
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,900
Looks like he might have
a big ol' hard drive

76
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:01,787
with a lot of ram.

77
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:04,773
Yeah, he's cute, but I don't
want a relationship right now.

78
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,408
And I don't do one-night stands.

79
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,810
All right, so don't stand. Lay down.

80
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:10,112
That's not me--

81
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:12,313
the next morning,
doing the walk of shame.

82
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:15,200
I always see those girls
with their messed-up sex hair,

83
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:17,152
carrying their heels,
clutching their coats

84
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:18,486
to hide last night's outfit.

85
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,822
Going into Kinko's to use Google maps

86
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:23,508
so you can figure out where you are.

87
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,880
You really put the "ho" in "Kinko."

88
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:31,016
Oh. Sorry, Sophie.

89
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:31,967
We're closed.

90
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,435
Oh, no. I'll be quick.

91
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,353
I just want a cupcake to go.

92
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:39,191
I'm on my way to 24 hour fitness.

93
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:44,446
Ja, and I put it on the cupcake
holder on the treadmill.

94
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:50,118
Uh, Max,
my town car is parked out front

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,454
and I was wondering
if you wanted me to wait

96
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:55,123
for you and Caroline to give you
a ride back to our building.

97
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,458
Oh, no. It's okay.

98
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,742
We still have to clean up
and take the garbage out.

99
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,127
Oh.

100
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,369
Oh, looks like the garbage
is taking itself out.

101
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:11,506
The game continues.

102
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:12,808
Here is my number.

103
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,342
I invite you to call me

104
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,478
when you realize what a catch I am.

105
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,364
Or any time you are drunk and willing.

106
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,684
Max, I'm going to need the doggy bag as well.

107
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,436
Not for the cupcake.

108
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,689
To puke in.

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
So I'll get this finalized,

110
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,229
and then I'll stop
by the diner tomorrow

111
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,915
so you can sign off on
the layout before we go live.

112
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,583
This is so exciting.

113
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,735
Oh, wait, Edwin. Shoot.

114
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:42,621
I forgot to show you
the new pricing chart.

115
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,289
It's cool, I can draft it up right now

116
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,573
and upload it when I get home.

117
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,876
Yeah, webmaster. You work pretty fast.

118
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:50,378
But I bet you can work slow, too.

119
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,631
And really fast again.

120
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,266
I can be done in a minute.

121
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:56,101
Ooh, not what you want to hear.

122
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:57,686
Max.

123
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,604
It's fine. We can wait.

124
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,106
You know what? You stay here.

125
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:03,608
I have to go to the store
and pick up stuff for your--

126
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,060
my what?

127
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:09,781
Your cupcake business that
you're making me do with you.

128
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:10,932
Get home safe.

129
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,951
Um, hey, where do you live, Edwin?

130
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,069
Hell's kitchen.

131
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,237
Oh, cool.

132
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,571
You're going to want
to take the "c" down,

133
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:18,240
transfer to the "l,"
and if you get lost,

134
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,408
there's a Kinko's on 6th and 14th.

135
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,862
That's embarrassing. Max was just trying to--

136
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,947
yeah, I work on complicated web programs.

137
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,333
I think I cracked that code.

138
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:29,801
She wants us to hook up.

139
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah. I'm sorry.

140
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,288
Why are you sorry?

141
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,958
That's all I've been thinking about.

142
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,989
Yum, yum.

143
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,808
Oh, my God.

144
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,361
They are so hot.

145
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:10,175
Don't give me that look.

146
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,021
Oleg.

147
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:24,306
Caroline.

148
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,857
What are you doing here?

149
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,559
What are you doing here?

150
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:30,395
I live here, and I'm just coming out

151
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,013
from going to get coffee.

152
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,699
It was delicious.
I drank every bit of it.

153
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,118
Outside. That's why I don't have a cup.

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,188
But you're wearing
the same outfit from last night.

155
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,074
You're wearing the same outfit
from last night.

156
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:45,460
And you have messed-up sex hair.

157
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:48,129
You have messed-up sex hair.

158
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,382
Webmaster?

159
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:52,400
Sophie?

160
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:55,503
She called me up and we made hand love.

161
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,372
But I thought Sophie hated you.

162
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:01,209
Well, she doesn't hate my hand.

163
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,894
But you cannot tell anyone.

164
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,429
That was her one condition.

165
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,514
That and a copy
of my recent blood tests

166
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,600
signed by a medical professional.

167
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,717
Deal.

168
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,403
And you can't tell
anyone about me, either.

169
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:12,320
Especially Max.

170
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:13,772
I'd never hear the end of it.

171
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:14,739
Deal.

172
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,740
Pinky swear?

173
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:16,891
Actually, never mind.

174
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:18,026
I don't know where
your fingers have been.

175
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:21,696
I just told you where they've been.

176
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,666
Max

177
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:29,488
I'm so excited for this party.

178
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,825
I wore my loose clothing
so I can dance all night.

179
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:36,295
God, I cannot take this party pressure.

180
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,329
I'm just going to go in the back

181
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,915
and run a can opener across my wrist.

182
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,417
Oh, Max. I'm sure you did a great job.

183
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,920
You know, as long as you have a DJ,

184
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,890
some champagne, and a psychic.

185
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:50,709
No, no, and no.

186
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,644
I got some balloons, a hummus tray,

187
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,979
and possibly Earl.

188
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:56,131
He still hasn't confirmed.

189
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,215
Oh.

190
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,650
You don't need psychic to know

191
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:02,154
that this is going to be
a horrible, horrible party.

192
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:04,439
Well, thank God
Caroline has new boy toy.

193
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,391
She might not mind as much.

194
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:07,943
What are you talking about?

195
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,280
Yeah, I saw them kissing in
front of the diner last night.

196
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,284
Yeah, I sat there
and watched for an hour.

197
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:20,005
They were really going at it,
hot and heavy.

198
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:24,293
You know, like the Showtime
network in the good old days.

199
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,410
Oh, great.

200
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,212
Now I have to invite him
to the party, too?

201
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,431
I only got a six-pack of Capri Suns,

202
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,800
so people are going to have to share.

203
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,852
Congratulations, it's official.

204
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:35,304
Our website is now live.

205
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,189
Congratulations, it's official.

206
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,225
You're a whore.

207
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,779
I hear you got
your Kinko's card punched.

208
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:45,063
What?

209
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,198
Don't "what" me.

210
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,951
I know you hooked up
with the webmaster.

211
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:50,235
Pick up.

212
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,437
Oleg, you told Max?

213
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,456
What's happening?

214
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,490
Our deal's off.

215
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:57,993
Oleg had sex with Sophie last night.

216
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,294
No...

217
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,881
It wasn't sex. Just hand stuff.

218
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:04,666
Yeah, and nothing above the waist.

219
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:08,053
I'm a lady.

220
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:12,674
I got all hot and bothered
watching Caroline and big Han.

221
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:16,178
Okay...

222
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,047
You know, I really think
this is between Caroline and me.

223
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,984
You mean between Caroline,
you, and your strippers.

224
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:23,402
Strippers?

225
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:25,737
I have seen this man in a strip club.

226
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,323
Han, you were in a strip club?

227
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,493
Earl took me.

228
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,033
Damn it, Han.

229
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,201
You're going to sell me out

230
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:43,171
after I spotted you $100 in ones.

231
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:46,792
You went to Spreaders without me?

232
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,711
Why would you take Han to a strip club?

233
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:53,164
Yeah, is his lap even big enough for a dance?

234
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,384
Earl, I'm so disappointed in you.

235
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,886
That's it. I'm not going to your party.

236
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,937
What party?

237
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:00,188
Damn it, Earl!

238
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,774
It's supposed to be
a surprise for her birthday.

239
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,843
Who told you it was my birthday?

240
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,028
Han.

241
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,562
Damn it, Han!

242
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,281
I didn't want a party

243
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:11,116
and I don't want to celebrate
my birthday this year.

244
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:12,451
Well, too bad,

245
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:15,404
because your BFF is throwing you
a big blow-out.

246
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,906
Oh, Max. Now I feel bad.

247
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,743
You feel bad now, wait till you see the party.

248
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:28,500
Caroline's birthday. Woot, woot.

249
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,803
Thanks, but you don't have
to say that after everything.

250
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,840
Max...

251
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,125
I know you had limited budget,

252
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,311
but music is free.

253
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:43,765
Yeah, well, I'm a douche.

254
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:47,319
Speech!

255
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:50,355
Speech!

256
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:54,058
I can't carry this party much longer.

257
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:57,228
Okay, I'd like to say something.

258
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,280
Wait, wait.

259
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,732
Can't we wait till we cut the cake?

260
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,066
Cake?

261
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:04,336
People are still doing that?

262
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:08,840
Yes. Our livelihood depends on it.

263
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:11,426
There's only one party as bad as this one.

264
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:16,598
That's the Donner Party.

265
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:23,205
And even they had better food.

266
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,725
I'd like to say happy birthday
to a very pretty lady

267
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,643
who I just had the pleasure of meeting,

268
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,329
and I think I'm going
to be seeing a lot more of her.

269
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:32,697
Aw.

270
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,766
I'll go get us some more drinks.

271
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,100
Okay.

272
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:38,787
Get rid of him.

273
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:40,238
What?

274
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,406
It was a one-time thing.

275
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:43,458
I thought you weren't that kind of girl.

276
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,109
I realized it had almost been a year

277
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:46,711
since I had sex, and I decided

278
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:48,997
I rather not be that kind of girl.

279
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,248
But I don't want a relationship.

280
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,134
Hey, I get it. Hit it and quit it.

281
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:53,718
♪ hit it, don't babysit it ♪

282
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,221
Max, please.

283
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,172
Fine.

284
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,223
How am I going to make him go away?

285
00:11:58,225 --> 00:11:59,341
It's not going to take a lot

286
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,626
to convince someone
to leave this party.

287
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:05,397
I'd like to ask everyone
to raise their cocktail,

288
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,348
but I can't.

289
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,685
So raise your Capri to the sun...

290
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:16,681
For a very special lady who I'm
sure I will be seeing more of.

291
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:27,502
Get rid of him. It was a one-time thing.

292
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,923
So was that the worst party
you've ever been to?

293
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:35,326
That was the worst party
anyone's ever been to.

294
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:39,163
So with the webmaster, how was the sex?

295
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:40,932
Pretty good.

296
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,100
But then he did that thing

297
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,969
where he pretended
he was going to choke me.

298
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,854
When did guys start doing that?

299
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:46,805
I don't know,

300
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,106
but if I knew that was his thing,

301
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:50,008
I would've asked him
to choke me at the party.

302
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,443
How did you get rid of him?

303
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,478
What did you say?
Did you let him down gently?

304
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,564
No, I told him to hit the pike.

305
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,649
It's a one-night stand. Guys get that.

306
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,318
So that's it? He wasn't upset?

307
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,404
Guys don't care.

308
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,123
One-night stands-- they come, they go.

309
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,190
Literally.

310
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,460
But what if he wants to see me again?

311
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:09,494
Relax.

312
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,962
It is not going
to come back to haunt you.

313
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,914
Unless you start feeling an itch...

314
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,799
Or a kick.

315
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,301
Well, thanks for dumping him.

316
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:17,502
And for the...

317
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:20,422
I'm going to go ahead
and call it a party.

318
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,224
I knew you wouldn't want me

319
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,892
to use any of the cupcake money,

320
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,060
and I was broke.

321
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:27,062
So I guess I am your BFF--

322
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,564
your broke friend forever.

323
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,850
Max, it really doesn't matter
what you would've done.

324
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,602
The only thing
I really wanted for my birthday

325
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,986
was to see my father.

326
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:38,056
And he's in prison,
so that didn't happen.

327
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:41,326
I may not be a good BFF,

328
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,611
I may not throw a great party,

329
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,581
but I do know where
to find a free bus to prison.

330
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,567
Hey, everybody.
We got a birthday girl onboard.

331
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,671
Sit yo ass back down!

332
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:56,091
See? Now we got a party.

333
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,753
This is nice getting out of the city.

334
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,039
Kind of reminds me
of the ride to the Hamptons.

335
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,190
Yo.

336
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:09,176
This your first time on the bangbus?

337
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:13,965
We call it the bangbus because
everybody here gonna get banged.

338
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,000
And in addition 'cause we're on a bus.

339
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,385
Hmm, makes sense.

340
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:18,319
Hey, I'm Shonda.

341
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:20,504
I'm Max. This is Caroline.

342
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,674
So you're all going for,
like, conjugal visits?

343
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,059
Pretty fancy term for getting

344
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,511
shawshanked on a three-legged cot.

345
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,897
Shawshanked. I like her.

346
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:30,865
I like your hair.

347
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:33,517
Did you just get back from Cancun?

348
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,519
No, no.

349
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,405
I saved up,
and I got these done for my man.

350
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:38,406
He says they make me

351
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:40,041
look like Alicia Keys meets Ed Norton

352
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:41,959
in <i>American History X.</i>

353
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,661
How sweet.

354
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,463
Ah, yo. What's your man in for?

355
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:48,833
My man's in for possession
of a sweet, sweet ass.

356
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,502
He makes that joke every time.

357
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:54,255
He's not my man, actually. He's my dad.

358
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,506
Oh, so you're a freak.

359
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,525
That's all right. I don't judge.

360
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,978
You see a name tag
on me that says "Judy"?

361
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,097
Oh, look. We just passed a Carvel.

362
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,899
What's a Carvel?

363
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:06,884
Carvel ice cream.

364
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:08,569
You know,
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss.

365
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,488
Come on, how could you not know Carvel?

366
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,739
They have them everywhere.

367
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:12,723
Oh, wait.

368
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:14,158
Is that that white trash ice cream?

369
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,493
How dare you!

370
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:18,079
It is not white trash.

371
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,530
And I wouldn't be so high and mighty.

372
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,248
You're on a free bangbus to a prison.

373
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,333
I'm sorry.

374
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:23,584
I didn't realize you had such

375
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,753
a strong emotional connection
to ice cream.

376
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:30,207
Not to the ice cream. The ice cream cake.

377
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,510
When I was ten, I asked my mom
for a birthday party.

378
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,378
She said yes but then flaked out

379
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,513
and forgot to call anyone.

380
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,131
I'm starting to understand why

381
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,933
you don't like birthday parties.

382
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,885
So after I waited on the porch for an hour,

383
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,770
I'll stole 20 bucks from her purse,

384
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,921
thumbed it out to Carvel,

385
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,723
and bought myself
a Fudgie the Whale cake.

386
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,609
Ate the whole thing
with a pink plastic spoon,

387
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:51,646
and it was way better than
any party ever could have been.

388
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:52,880
I heard that.

389
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:54,482
There ain't nothing better
than Fudgie the Whale.

390
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:56,433
I love the chocolate crunchies.

391
00:15:56,435 --> 00:16:01,155
Bitch, everybody love
the damn chocolate crunchies!

392
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,127
Hey, Shonda. Who are you here to see?

393
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,295
Who's available?

394
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:12,917
I'm just cracking wise.
You know I'm here to see Squirm.

395
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,418
Search her.

396
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,888
Damn. Is it my turn again?

397
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,173
Next.

398
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,625
We're not on that list. We didn't call ahead.

399
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,127
Leave it to me.

400
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,346
I've gotten into every club
I've ever wanted to get into.

401
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,898
Hi. Caroline Channing plus one.

402
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,850
I don't see you on the list.

403
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:31,402
Really? That's weird.

404
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,904
We should be on the list.
We're always on the list.

405
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,272
Max, we're not on the list.

406
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:39,276
We're not? I'm going to kill my assistant.

407
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,995
Oh, I know.

408
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:44,115
It might be under Deangelo Jefferson.

409
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,250
Come on, girls. Don't waste my time.

410
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:49,203
I'd like to see a manager.

411
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:53,124
There's no manager.

412
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,959
It's a prison.

413
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,511
Well, then who runs this place?

414
00:16:57,513 --> 00:17:02,967
Well, the Aryan brotherhood
is getting pretty strong.

415
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:05,186
This is such amateur hour.

416
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,138
Give me 50 bucks for the door guy.

417
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,190
Are you seriously trying to bribe

418
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:12,943
an officer of the law
while inside a prison?

419
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,029
That's a federal offense.

420
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:16,180
Is it?

421
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:19,817
Probably.

422
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,153
Look, I should have you thrown
out for even suggesting it.

423
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:23,788
We do not accept bribes.

424
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,039
Okay, fine.

425
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,291
I'll let you take
your sweet time searching me

426
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,744
on the way in.

427
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:31,962
These two are clear to go through.

428
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,582
Max, you can't do that for me.

429
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,834
It's really for me. It's been a while.

430
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:40,004
Woot, woot.

431
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,224
I'm so excited to see my father

432
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,592
after all this time.

433
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,060
How do I look?

434
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:47,178
You look good. How do I look?

435
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,214
Do I still have
that freshly felt-up glow?

436
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:53,217
Well, that ginger over there
thinks you look good.

437
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,052
He's full-on staring at you.

438
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,987
Well, I should hope so.

439
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,773
If you can't get a dude
in prison to check you out,

440
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,658
it's time for a makeover.

441
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,296
No, he's looking
and nodding like he knows you.

442
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,584
Never seen him before in my life.

443
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:11,702
Max?

444
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:13,737
Max Black?

445
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,756
It's me, Irish.

446
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,925
I don't know, dude.
I think you got the wrong girl.

447
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,177
Max, I could never forget that face.

448
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:24,265
Trust me, you've never seen me before.

449
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,050
Oh, damn!

450
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,635
Oh, my God!

451
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:29,303
That's you.

452
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:30,938
So you do remember.

453
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,439
Of course.

454
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:35,442
Get rid of him.
It was a one-night stand.

455
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,427
See, they do come back to haunt you.

456
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:38,479
Shirt on.

457
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:40,481
Max, can you believe it?

458
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,233
Of all the prisons in all the world,

459
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:43,484
you walked into mine.

460
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:44,601
It's kismet.

461
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:47,655
I got rid of yours. You get rid of mine.

462
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,607
Listen, Irish. It was a one-time thing.

463
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,326
You're a guy. You get that.

464
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,328
How could you say it's a one-time thing?

465
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,496
I love you.

466
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:59,116
I blew up that chipotle for you.

467
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,135
Listen, I appreciate the ink,

468
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:02,920
but I don't really believe in love,

469
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:03,954
and truth be told,

470
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,390
I'm not even a fan of Mexican food.

471
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,592
Caroline Channing. This table.

472
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:10,460
Max, we have to go. My dad's coming.

473
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:12,129
Okay. Nice to see you, Irish.

474
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,848
Your body looks sick.

475
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,065
Max, hold on.

476
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,233
I'm not going to tell you again to back up.

477
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,818
Max, I'm not going to lose you twice.

478
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,069
I said, back up!

479
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:20,187
Don't tell me to back up.

480
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:21,655
That's the love of my life.

481
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:23,807
Come on, dude. Hit the pike.

482
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,192
Calm down.

483
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,380
Don't tell me to calm down!

484
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,917
Visiting hours are over! Everybody out!

485
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,168
No, no, no, wait! I can't leave.

486
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,787
Damn!

487
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,322
Oh, wait. There's my father.

488
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,757
I can see him, he's just coming in.

489
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,842
Oh, daddy. Daddy...
Hi!

490
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,713
Well, thank you very much, ladies.

491
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,999
My man was barely in
when I got pulled out.

492
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:52,686
I would like to apologize to everyone

493
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,339
for taking the bang out of the bus,

494
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:57,224
but in my own defense,

495
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,510
everyone here knows a little
something about crazy guys.

496
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:03,030
Sit yo ass back down!

497
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:05,566
Max, sit down before you start another riot.

498
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:07,184
I'm sorry. I blew it.

499
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,986
I screwed up your chance
to see your father.

500
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:10,237
I screwed up your party.

501
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,856
I even screwed up the
easiest birthday thing to do,

502
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,208
like get a cake.

503
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,026
I'm a terrible BFF.

504
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,244
It's okay.

505
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,996
Really, it's fine.

506
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,364
With the year I'm having,

507
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,665
it's not like you could've
made everything better

508
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,417
just by getting me a cake.

509
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,271
Well, no. Not just any cake.

510
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,509
Just as good as I remember it.

511
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,196
Best 40 bucks we ever spent.

512
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:37,398
And this birthday turned out
to be all right.

513
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,733
I did get what I wanted.

514
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:39,817
I got see my father.

515
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:42,686
It was only for a second,
but I saw him.

516
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:45,072
And he saw me. So thank you.

517
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:48,292
Yeah, and I got to see Irish.

518
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:50,861
Think he might be
the one that got away.

519
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,963
Well, the one that got put away.

520
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,216
You know, you and I are better than BFFs.

521
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,917
We're BBFs.

522
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,721
Bangbus friends.

523
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,903
