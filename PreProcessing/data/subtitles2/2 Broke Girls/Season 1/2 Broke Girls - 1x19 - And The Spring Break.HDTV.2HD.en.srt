1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:02,645
Max, look out,
you're so tired

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:04,091
you're spilling batter
all over yourself.

3
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:05,314
Ugh.

4
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:06,649
I knew it was only
a matter of time

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,931
before I became
a battered woman.

6
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:12,058
This is
a huge disappointment.

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,018
I heard that.

8
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,187
You don't even know
what I'm referring to.

9
00:00:16,188 --> 00:00:19,398
Oh, I just assumed we were
talking about everything.

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm referring
to our expensive

11
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,498
new cupcake website.

12
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:23,903
Not one job offer.

13
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:26,219
You want a website that will make you
feel better about yourself?

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,000
Go to
models-falling-down.com

15
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,163
number one:
Klum goes boom.

16
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,251
It's 3:00 A.M.
Who would be coming over now?

17
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:40,549
I don't know,
my dealer, my other dealer?

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,603
That guy who always asks
if I know where my dealer is?

19
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,190
- Who is it?
- You can't handle

20
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,970
what's on the other
side of that door.

21
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:50,927
Yesterday,
I saw a guy on a stoop

22
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,111
frenching his cat.

23
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:54,497
I can handle anything.

24
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,837
Oleg, what are you
doing here?

25
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:04,861
And you put the, "oh, no,"
in kimono.

26
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:06,893
Your upstairs neighbor
Sophie

27
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:08,739
is allowing me
to have sex with her.

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,264
And I came down to borrow
some sensual oils.

29
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:13,849
Preferably,
ones that you can eat.

30
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:17,915
How did you
get out of apartment?

31
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,805
You know the rules.

32
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:22,925
I came down
to borrow sensual oils.

33
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:24,810
Yeah, but no peppermint.

34
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,779
It makes his tongue swell.

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,197
And let's face it,

36
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:32,096
his tongue is the best part
about him.

37
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:35,671
You're right,
I can't handle that.

38
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,529

40
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,584
Those nice smelling men
in booth two

41
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,198
just asked me
if I was on the down-low.

42
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,671
What does this mean?

43
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,284
Uh, brother,

44
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:59,092
I'm gonna need
a little more context.

45
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,739
They said,
"are you on the down-low,

46
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,972
because we have a friend
who is a big-time rice queen."

47
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:06,767
Again, coming up dry.

48
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:08,936
Rice queen, is it, like,
a Korean dairy queen?

49
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:10,916
Kind of.

50
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:13,607
Here's table seven's check,
Earl.

51
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:15,275
Max,
the guys at booth two

52
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,236
just asked Han
if was on the down-low.

53
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,238
They think he's gay.

54
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,542
That's a step up.

55
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:23,929
Usually people think
he's a lesbian.

56
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:28,830
Here you go, Sophie.

57
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,852
Uh, Max, Caroline.

58
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:32,793
Yeah, about last night,

59
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:36,797
I hope we can keep that
just between us girls.

60
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,827
I'm sure we have all
done things in the dark

61
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:42,511
late at night with men
that we'd like to forget.

62
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:44,583
Why stop at late at night
in the dark?

63
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,001
How about early morning?

64
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:48,850
Or a nooner at
the port authority bus terminal?

65
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:50,352
Oh, good.

66
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,437
And you too understand,
Caroline?

67
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,992
Actually, no, sorry.

68
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:55,377
I haven't ever done
anything with a man

69
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:57,262
- that I'm ashamed of.
- Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:58,930
But your father did
steal millions

71
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:02,239
and millions of dollars.

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,666
So... don't forget that.

73
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,174
Han just sat
your favorite gays.

74
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:12,611
Max, their names
are Steven and Michael.

75
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:15,043
And it's not very P.C. To reduce
people to a stereotype.

76
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:19,201
- Hey, girl.
- What's up, care bear?

77
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,785
Yeah, they're not
stereotypes.

78
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,654
What would you say
if they called you

79
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,469
"the big-boob waitress from
the wrong side of the tracks

80
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,263
who had sex
with everyone in high school"?

81
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:28,043
I'd say,
"that's why I love the gays.

82
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:29,933
They get me."

83
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,413
Come over and say hello.

84
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:32,881
They're the first
and practically the only

85
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,147
people that ever hired us
to do a cupcake job.

86
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,635
Do I have to?

87
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:38,650
Can't I just stand here
and judge from afar?

88
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,153
Come on, and let's not
mention how bad we're doing.

89
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,891
We want them to think
we're a big success,

90
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,608
so they'll recommend us
for their friends' events.

91
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,200
Yeah, because you know the gays,
they party about everything.

92
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,565
And there's
another stereotype.

93
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:53,248
- Hi, guys.
- Happy leap year!

94
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,153
F.Y.I., people
are still talking about

95
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,127
those cupcakes you made
for our wedding shower.

96
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,024
- Everyone.
- How's business?

97
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:00,909
Fabulous, amazing,
killing it.

98
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,592
Or it's killing us.
We're not quite sure.

99
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,730
I'll go grab some menus
for you girls.

100
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,198
- Max.
- Sorry.

101
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,432
I'll go grab some menus
for you ladies.

102
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,976
Love her... so Madeleine Stowe
in <i>revenge.</i>

103
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,311
Oh, she is.

104
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,007
- I don't watch that.
- We love it.

105
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:17,425
It's all about
a young blonde woman

106
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,927
who's out to seek revenge
on everyone

107
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,442
for destroying her family.

108
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:23,048
Yeah, too close to home.

109
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,051
- Max, guess what.
- Caroline, you're not

110
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:27,719
supposed to tell me
I'm on <i>intervention</i>

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,951
until the actual
intervention.

112
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:32,120
I just got offered $600

113
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,758
to stay at Steven
and Michael's apartment

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,193
and watch their dogs
while they're out of town

115
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,595
- for two days.
- Why would anyone pay $600

116
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:39,669
to watch dogs
for two days?

117
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,099
Well, because, you know,
they want a certain

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,433
amount of attention
to be paid to the...

119
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:46,176
Just say it, they're gay and they think
their dogs are their children.

120
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,303
Max, you have to stop
doing this.

121
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,180
I'll stop
when they stop.

122
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:51,826
This is so exciting.

123
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,945
It'll be like a paid vacation
at an amazing hotel.

124
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:56,353
And I need to get as far away
from here as possible.

125
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,980
- Oh, where do they live?
- Four blocks away.

126
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,885
Well, have a good time.

127
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:02,671
And while you're
four blocks away

128
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:04,422
having your vacation,
I'll be home

129
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:06,808
maybe taking a little
masturbacation.

130
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,345
What are you
talking about?

131
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:12,130
I wouldn't go on vacation
without you.

132
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,682
We'll split the dog money
to cover the shifts

133
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,205
we take off
from the diner.

134
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:16,818
Well, thanks,
but I don't do that thing

135
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,250
where you take off work.

136
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,471
"Hi, I'm Max, I can't go

137
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:22,629
"to a fancy apartment
and have fun.

138
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,992
"I'd rather work
in a steel mill

139
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:26,558
and sing
Bruce Springsteen songs."

140
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,914
Max, when was the last time
you had a vacation?

141
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,138
Never.

142
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,717
Unless you count
the summer I hid

143
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:35,809
under the front porch
from my mom's new boyfriend.

144
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,088
We really need
to get out of here.

145
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,623
This is more than just
spring break.

146
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:39,958
It's a break
from the diner,

147
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,344
from the cupcake business,
from being poor,

148
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,234
from everything
depressing right now.

149
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,715
Things aren't
that depressing.

150
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,884
Oh.

151
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,990
Yeah, well,
I'm sure we have

152
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,910
all done things with men
in kitchens that...

153
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:17,662
We are not proud of.

154
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,995
Spring break
is the greatest time ever.

155
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:31,947
You just go crazy
and do shots

156
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:34,047
and throw all the rules
out the window.

157
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,751
Oh, I've done that.

158
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:38,537
But when you're poor,
you just call it Tuesday.

159
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:43,926
Why are you
walking like that?

160
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,678
This is my
spring break walk.

161
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,396
These shoulders
have shimmied like this

162
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:49,131
all the way
from Majorca to Ibiza.

163
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:50,766
Try it, Max.
Shake a little.

164
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,384
- Shake.
- That's cool.

165
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:55,020
I'll just wait till
I get the DTS later.

166
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:59,642
Maybe I don't
have the right key.

167
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,032
Oh, hi.

168
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,326
Sorry, I think we might
be at the wrong door.

169
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,161
That's a bummer
for the door.

170
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:06,782
It's over there, 12d.

171
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:08,498
We're house-sitting
for a few days.

172
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:09,874
Cool, I'm Brendon.

173
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,121
Hey, Brendon.
I'm Ashley.

174
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:15,324
- And...
- I'm surprised.

175
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,293
- And also Max.
- I'd shake your hands,

176
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:18,794
but I kind of stink.

177
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:20,546
I've been at my microbrewery
most of the day,

178
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:23,012
so I am sorry
if I smell like yeast.

179
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,390
Hey, that's my apology.

180
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,470
Whoa, all right, cool.

181
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:31,062
Well, I will see
you guys around, yeah?

182
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:33,509
Yeah, totes.

183
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:38,480
You have something
you want to tell me, Ashley?

184
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,566
I never use Caroline channing
on vacation

185
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,967
for security reasons.

186
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,519
I was almost abducted
at gunpoint

187
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,243
for a ransom
in Mexico city.

188
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:46,655
Wow, gunpoint.

189
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:48,705
Were you using the word,
"totes" at the time?

190
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:52,083
Can you take out the paper
that has the alarm code on it?

191
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,422
Wow, this place
is amazing.

192
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:00,336
It's, like, the cover
of <i>gay gay gay magazine.</i>

193
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:03,922
Max, you have to stop
reducing them

194
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,490
to that gay stereotype.

195
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:08,127
Now, read me
the security code.

196
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:12,145
It's..."Liza."

197
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,016
A lot of different
types of people

198
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,524
like Liza Minnelli.

199
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:23,448
Oh, look,
it's a poodle in a tutu.

200
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,528
That's not gay, right?

201
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,530
Lots of...
Lots of different

202
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:32,951
types of people
have a poodle in a tutu...

203
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:36,002
Named Barbra Streisand.

204
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:40,476
Oh, there's the book
of instructions.

205
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,092
"Hey, girl.
Hey, care bear.

206
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:45,798
"Have fun with Barbra Streisand
and Wynonna Judd.

207
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,549
"Wynonna is a little
temperamental

208
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,418
"and tends to stay
in the bedroom.

209
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:52,554
"We didn't have time to purge
her anal gland before left.

210
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,812
Instructions on page two."

211
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,815
I'm starting
to understand the $600.

212
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:00,262
"Don't worry, it's easy.
We do it all the time."

213
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:02,547
No wonder Wynonna's
so temperamental.

214
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:04,433
"Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

215
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:07,033
There are portable saunas
in the closet."

216
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:08,387
Portable saunas?

217
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:11,004
Love it, what is it?

218
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,845
This is so cool.

219
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:18,711
I'm hot
like I'm at the beach,

220
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:21,798
but I'm not stepping
in any used condoms.

221
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,035
Yeah, these are great.

222
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,403
My friend
Candice travelstead

223
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:26,552
used one to make weight
for prom.

224
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,123
Are you done with that?

225
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,092
Yeah, switch?

226
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:31,293
On spring break,
I always loved

227
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:32,600
spending the day
at the beach.

228
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:35,144
Just the chilling
and the girl talk.

229
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,915
Yeah.
Tell me again,

230
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,565
about the sound the anal gland
made when you squeezed it.

231
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:40,936
Please, stop.

232
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,587
I already told you twice.

233
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,654
And now, wynonna Judd
won't even look at me.

234
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,476
Well, not without
her lawyer in the room.

235
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:50,076
I'm hungry.
What do you eat on vacation?

236
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:51,780
Anything we want.

237
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:53,565
Let's see.

238
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:58,103
I bet their refrigerator is
stocked with all kinds of pates

239
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,989
and cheeses
and those parm crisp things.

240
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,624
By the way, nice suit.

241
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,460
You look like someone should
be pouring a 40 on you

242
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,178
in a rap video.

243
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,114
Thanks.

244
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:10,466
There's nothing.

245
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:13,141
I mean, come on,
what kind of gays are they?

246
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:15,685
All anal gland
and no cheese.

247
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:17,923
I just expected
everything to be better.

248
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:19,647
You know,
champagne on ice,

249
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:21,343
thousand
thread-count sheets.

250
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,860
I mean, the towels...
They're not even bath sheets.

251
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,314
Wait, the towels
aren't good?

252
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:27,739
Because I already stole two.

253
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,017
They're fine,
they're just not

254
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,324
what I was expecting.

255
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,904
What's happening
over there?

256
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,370
You could use
a little shoulders.

257
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,308
You're right,
enough, we're on vacay.

258
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,110
Come on, let's go get dressed
and find someplace to eat.

259
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,112
Are you crazy?
I am not leaving this thing.

260
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:42,795
This is the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

261
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,867
Okay, we'll order in,
pretend it's room service.

262
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:47,258
They must have a menu drawer
here somewhere.

263
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,504
Plus, we'll never
find a restaurant

264
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:50,386
with a portable sauna
section.

265
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,591
"Food network party tonight

266
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:54,676
"to celebrate
the release of a cookbook.

267
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,100
Food and drink provided."

268
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,714
Free foodie food,
free foodie drinks?

269
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:01,049
- Yay, let's go.
- No, I like it in here.

270
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,815
It's amazing.

271
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,503
Ashley wants to go.

272
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:06,522
Ashley wants to go.

273
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,613
Fine,
but can I bring the dog?

274
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:10,025
I've always wanted
to be one of those girls

275
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,727
who brings a tiny dog
to a public place

276
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:13,445
and just
looks at everyone, like,

277
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,953
"yeah, I have a tiny dog,
so what?"

278
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:17,816
You can be whoever
you want to be.

279
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,101
You're on vacation.

280
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,702
I'm gonna go invite
Brendon to come.

281
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,710
You gotta have a crush
on spring break.

282
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:25,123
Well,
I'm sitting in my crush.

283
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,923
Hey, shouldn't you
put something on?

284
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:28,808
Uh, it's spring break.

285
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:35,300
Aah!

286
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:40,055
Barbra, get help.

287
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,841
Go, Barbra Streisand, go.

288
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,880
Hey,
look at the book title,

289
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:52,448
<i>306 degrees of heaven:
Bacon.</i>

290
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:56,071
Heaven bacon.
That's good wordplay.

291
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,739
It's okay.
Not much of a crowd.

292
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,372
Party's a little
disappointing.

293
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,827
Bacon truffle,
Barbra Streisand?

294
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:04,085
Mm?

295
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:08,233
Yeah, I'm feeding my tiny dog
a truffle, so what?

296
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:10,068
Miss, miss.

297
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,801
Excuse me,
what are these things for?

298
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,261
Oh, it holds your drink
while you get food.

299
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,924
- No!
- Yeah.

300
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,432
Yeah, these are great when
you see them for the first time.

301
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,178
For me,
it was on a yacht

302
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,394
in the Mediterranean.

303
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:23,415
You know what else
these are good for?

304
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,857
Frees up your shoulders
to shimmy.

305
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,276
You shimmy.
I'm gonna walk over here

306
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:32,655
and find us a bigger, shinier
something to do later.

307
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,092
Later?
We're going home

308
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:35,944
- to our amazing apartment.
- Or not.

309
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:37,396
Come on, Max,
it's spring break.

310
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:38,981
Let's not get tied down.

311
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:40,399
I'll be over there.

312
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,100
Yeah, we'll be over there.

313
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,785
Oh.

314
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:48,004
Hi. You're not allowed
to have dog in here.

315
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:49,922
Unless he wants
to buy the book.

316
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:52,592
What are you,
some kind of foodie bouncer?

317
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,677
Worse.
I wrote the book.

318
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,470
Yeah, nice sleeves.

319
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,052
You get those in
the tattoo gold rush of '09?

320
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:01,392
I'm Zeke.
What's your name?

321
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:03,672
I'm Max.
This is my tiny dog.

322
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:06,105
I take her everywhere,
so what?

323
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:08,900
Hey, Max, you wanna try
my thick-cut bacon?

324
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:11,847
Maybe. Let's just
take things slow.

325
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:14,633
I'm telling you,
it serves

326
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,351
the best
vegan stew anywhere.

327
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:18,117
You really should put it
in your blog.

328
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,489
Oh, if I write one more
article about something vegan,

329
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,775
all of my devoted
10,000 readers will hold hands

330
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:26,542
and jump collectively
out a window.

331
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,814
And I know you like to find
what's new and what's next.

332
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,047
Chocolate bacon?

333
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:34,286
I just need
a minute over there.

334
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,719
Hi, couldn't help
but overhear.

335
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,256
If you're looking
for what's new,

336
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,991
I found these
two adorable girls

337
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:41,390
who run a cupcake business

338
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:42,844
out of their home
in Williamsburg.

339
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,630
I know how that sounds,
but trust me,

340
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,146
totally fresh
and not at all overexposed.

341
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,357
And you're someone
I should listen to because...?

342
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,520
Sorry,
didn't introduce myself.

343
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,320
Ashley Emerson,
style editor for <i>Elle.</i>

344
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,530
Oh.

345
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,009
If you're interested,
I think I might have

346
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,177
a card in here somewhere.

347
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,160
Was holding on to it
for Martha.

348
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:04,449
Mr. Bacon action figure.

349
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,582
A world of bacon sampler.

350
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,737
And I want to apologize for
the food network trucker hat,

351
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,188
which has nothing
to do with bacon

352
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:12,023
and everything to do
with me being a sellout.

353
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:13,125
Guess what.

354
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,590
Ashley just gave our card

355
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,829
to a woman who's such a bitch
she must be important.

356
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,081
She's a food blogger.

357
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,215
It's a long shot,

358
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:21,800
but we need to get
some exposure.

359
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,385
Whoa, we are on vacation.

360
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:26,388
No business talk.
That was the deal, right?

361
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,475
This is Zeke, chef-slash-
author-slash-corporate sellout.

362
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,650
We were, uh...

363
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,396
We were thinking about
going back to the apartment

364
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:36,815
- to hang out.
- Oh, sounds fun.

365
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,406
Can I see you alone
for a second?

366
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:39,851
Well, not alone.

367
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,535
I bring my tiny dog
everywhere, so what?

368
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:45,390
Come on, I heard
of an after-party in Soho

369
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:47,325
and an after-after-party
in dumbo.

370
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:48,577
So, let's go-ho.

371
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:51,002
Have fun and get
this vacation started.

372
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,699
I'm holding a tiny dog
at a bacon-book party

373
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,168
and laughing with a guy
who wrote a book about bacon.

374
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:59,176
I think my vacation's
already started.

375
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:00,789
All right,
well, have fun.

376
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,387
I'm gonna go par-tay.

377
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:05,627
Eh, did your thing, Ash.

378
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:12,451
I don't want
to say that I'm hot.

379
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:16,038
But the bacon
in my pocket is done.

380
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,840
We said turns were
five minutes, you bastards.

381
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,276
Oh, hi.
More sauna fun.

382
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:24,296
Max, can I see you
in the hall for a second?

383
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:28,249
But it's my turn
to sweat my balls off.

384
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,535
Don't think the clock's
not running while I'm out there.

385
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:33,254
We're going
on a real vacation.

386
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,955
How quickly
can you pack a bag?

387
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:36,507
And don't worry about
appropriate evening wear.

388
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:37,842
Every four seasons
has a Gucci

389
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,770
near the Bulgari store
in the lobby.

390
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,463
None of those words
made any sense.

391
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:44,399
I think you've had
a spring break stroke.

392
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,684
No, seriously, there's a car
waiting downstairs

393
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,436
to take us
to a private plane.

394
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:49,937
We can be at Teterboro
in 20 minutes

395
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,188
and Tahiti in 8 hours.

396
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,841
The Greek
is paying for everything.

397
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,810
What did they give you?

398
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,954
What's the last thing
you can remember?

399
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,613
Nothing.

400
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,166
I just had some cristal.

401
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,627
Some cristal meth?

402
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,369
No, I'm just
really excited.

403
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,038
I went to the after-party
and this shipping magnate.

404
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,623
Don't worry,
it's not gonna be sexual.

405
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,358
More like a father thing.

406
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,054
Anyway, let's go... finally
got us a good vacation.

407
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,139
But we're having
a good vacation.

408
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,865
Max, don't take this
personally,

409
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:19,533
but you don't know what
a good vacation is

410
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:21,103
because you've
never been anywhere.

411
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,188
I mean, you walked
into that apartment

412
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:26,307
and your face lit up, like...
Like it was amazing.

413
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,392
And that's because
you don't know that it's not.

414
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:30,928
Trust me.
I've been everywhere.

415
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,658
And I'm telling you,
this is the worst vacation ever.

416
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,885
So let's ditch the bacon freak
and the beer bro,

417
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,387
get on that plane, spend
one great day at the beach,

418
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,749
and then come back
and make $8 an hour.

419
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,441
That sounds fun.

420
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,076
You kind of skipped over
the part where we get abducted

421
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,078
and Nancy grace
covers the year-long search

422
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,589
for our bodies.

423
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:52,884
It must be Constantine.
He's gonna be upset.

424
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,569
You never
keep a Greek waiting.

425
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,204
Oh, my God, Max,
we just got an email

426
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,707
on our website from that
food blogger at the book party.

427
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,959
She said if we drop off four
cupcakes by tomorrow morning,

428
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,929
she'll consider writing about
them for her column that day.

429
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,690
Well, what's it gonna be,
Caroline or Ashley?

430
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,884
Cupcakes or Tahiti?
Your call.

431
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,779
Is the Greek
still waiting?

432
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,688
He just pulled away.

433
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,825
I'm sure he'll come back here
for Ashley sometime.

434
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:19,536
And when that happens,
I wouldn't want to be her.

435
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:22,164
Well, after tomorrow,
you won't be.

436
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,290
What can I do?

437
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,032
You mean after
your two personalities

438
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,002
meet and kill each other?

439
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,903
Max, I told you
I needed a break.

440
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:31,506
I just didn't know it was
gonna be a psychotic one.

441
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,990
You really need
to chill.

442
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:34,408
You can't
keep freaking out

443
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,743
because you're not where
you want to be...

444
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,745
On vacation
or in our business.

445
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:40,849
I mean, it's life.
Lower your expectations.

446
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,934
This microbrew
is actually really good.

447
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,952
Tastes better
in the batter.

448
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:47,355
Hey, crumble up some of that
maple bacon for me.

449
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,139
Sorry about
that stuff I said

450
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,026
about you never having
gone anywhere.

451
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,626
Why?
I never have gone anywhere

452
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,478
or done anything.

453
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,230
And now I'm thinking
that's kind of a good thing,

454
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,349
because I can still
get excited and make a face

455
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,150
when something's new to me.

456
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:01,453
'Cause, basically,
everything is.

457
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:03,079
That must be nice.

458
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,541
All right, here,
taste it.

459
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:09,994
My beer-batter, maple bacon,
spring break cupcake.

460
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:16,676
Oh, my God, you made
the "something new" face.

461
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:19,336
I did, because
you made something new.

462
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:22,706
- It's delicious.
- Do the face again.

463
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:33,068
Oh, there they are,
the world travelers.

464
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,278
Shouldn't people be throwing
confetti or something?

465
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,004
I'm all out.

466
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:40,724
I snorted mine
in the power outage of '65.

467
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,160
How was your vacation?

468
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,478
Well, it turned out
to be more of a daycation,

469
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,346
but we had a great time,
didn't we, Max?

470
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:47,865
Yes, we did.

471
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,168
Max, things sure are dull
around here without you.

472
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:51,852
Everyone walking around
all P.C.,

473
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:54,347
nobody called me black.
Hell.

474
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:58,125
I haven't left once
since you've been gone.

475
00:18:58,126 --> 00:19:01,179
When it comes to this job,
you are my vacation.

476
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,863
Aw.

477
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:05,032
And that, Earl,
is why I got

478
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,718
all five
of these gift bags for you.

479
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:12,372
Welcome, again,
to the Williamsburg diner.

480
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,234
This way, please.

481
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:18,178
I have looked up "down-low"
and "rice queen" on Wikipedia.

482
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,380
And, no, I'm not
a secret homosexual

483
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,909
or a man who chases
only Asian men.

484
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,004
I'm great, I'm straight.
Get used to it.

485
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,823
Hi, guys.
How was your vacation?

486
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,877
Great. Did you have fun
at our place?

487
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,920
Totes.
Your saunas are sick.

488
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:37,007
I know.
Could they be any gayer?

489
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,399
No.

490
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,952
Just one thing.
Wynonna's still a little upset

491
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,680
about the anal gland event.

492
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,289
What?

493
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,292
I told you she wouldn't
know it was a joke.

494
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,581
How could she not know
it was a joke?

495
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:58,028
I mean, who would ask someone
to squeeze their dog's pooper?

496
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,113
We're paying you
another 50.

497
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:02,606
Dude, she went
second knuckle deep

498
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:06,745
in your beagle's back door
for only another 50?

499
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,204
150.

500
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:10,097
Thank you.

501
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:11,615
And just one other thing.

502
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,934
Our business is actually
not that great right now,

503
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:15,652
so if you could recommend us
to any of your friends,

504
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,464
- that would really help.
- Good for you.

505
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,216
I'm sure business will
pick up after that blog blurb.

506
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,576
- Wait, blog blurb?
- About your beer-battered

507
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,044
maple bacon
spring break cupcake.

508
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,305
We just read about it.

509
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,724
Yeah, in that
foodie bitch's blog.

510
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,184
Max, it worked.

511
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,061
Let's go look at the blog
on Han's computer.

512
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,854
Excuse us.
We'll be right back.

513
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:35,806
We got a little break
and a big break.

514
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:46,633
Yeah,
I did it again.

515
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:49,069
Yeah.

516
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,476
Welcome back.

517
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:59,305
You missed the best
two days of my life.

518
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:09,441
