1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,261
- Earl, can you break
some 20s?

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:05,595
The big spenders at table two

3
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:07,397
Wanna split their
$11 check three ways

4
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:10,901
Even though one person
did all the eating.

5
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:15,672
- I was in a three-way once.
Same thing happened.

6
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:22,479
- Max, table ten
would like the check.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,881
And don't forget to pick up
customer comment card.

8
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:26,950
Customers very important.

9
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,752
It's all about the fans.

10
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:31,822
- Yeah, I'm not a fan of
hearing what people have to say.

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,790
For instance,
what's happening right now--

12
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,425
Not a fan.

13
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,495
- Max, feedback from customers
is very important business tool.

14
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:42,299
Perhaps we'll pump the brakes
on sour waitress attitude.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,768
- There's only one tool
that can change my 'tude,

16
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,203
But I'm gonna need
two double-a batteries

17
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:49,339
And a 20-minute break.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,775
- ¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

19
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:53,310
[cash register bell dings]

20
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:59,382
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

21
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:00,884
- Welcome, everyone.

22
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,619
Thanks for coming
to very important

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,054
First official diner meeting.

24
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:07,824
- This ain't right, man.
2:00 a.M. Starts earl time.

25
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,092
- Earl, here's your brandy.

26
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:12,929
- Okay, we're good now.

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,132
- If I knew we were gonna have
staff meetings after work,

28
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:18,502
I would've taken job
at t.G.I. Friday instead.

29
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:21,771
Over there,
they roll fast and loose.

30
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,473
- Well, this is how I roll.

31
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:25,542
- Yeah, short and slow.

32
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:31,515
- No, I roll fast and furious.
Tokyo drift style.

33
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:35,085
- Han, I'm starting to drift.
Can we get to the point?

34
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,721
Max and I still have to get home
and bake cupcakes for tomorrow.

35
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,291
- We received so many excellent
comments from customers tonight.

36
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:43,093
Okay, first comment.

37
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:46,463
"dark-haired waitress..."
- hey!

38
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:47,998
- "was very rude.

39
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,967
- Hey!

40
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,235
- Max, customers are giving

41
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,637
Their honest opinions
about diner.

42
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,672
We need to take it seriously.

43
00:01:55,673 --> 00:02:00,777
"i'd like to ride the blonde
waitress like a tilt-a-whirl."

44
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:03,613
- Shout out!

45
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:04,748
- Next comment.

46
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,783
"why does cashier
wear earphones?

47
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:08,485
I thought he was a dj."

48
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,987
Both: ¶ go, earl,
go, earl ¶

49
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:12,222
- Holla!

50
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,323
- Moving on.

51
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,192
"this meatloaf tastes stale
and dry."

52
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:18,728
Both: ¶ yeah, oleg
yeah, oleg ¶

53
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,364
- It also says that cook
could wear deodorant

54
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,400
And shirt that covers armpit.

55
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,604
- This is on card?
- Yes.

56
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,406
- You are lying.

57
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,308
- Yes.

58
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:34,911
- Remind me never to be a spy
with han.

59
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:38,081
- So this is how you tell me
what you think of me?

60
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,917
You hide behind outdated
method of feedback?

61
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:45,956
- What, I should've posted
twitpic of my face like this?

62
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:51,261
- Maybe I will send you
a twitpic of my meatloaf.

63
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:53,496
- Can you twits pick
another time to do this?

64
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:54,864
I've gotta go home.

65
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:56,499
- I have to go home too...

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,969
And cut the remaining sleeves
off of all my shirts.

67
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,403
And then go buy more shirts

68
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,539
And cut the sleeves
off those shirts.

69
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,873
- You must wear sleeves.

70
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:05,308
- Do not tell me what to do.

71
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,510
I was working here
when you were still a dumpling

72
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:10,914
On your father's chopstick.

73
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:14,718
- Now this is starting to sound
like earl time.

74
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,713
- Did it light?
- No.

75
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:27,949
Try another one.
The gas is on.

76
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,019
Ah!

77
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,254
- Why are we throwing fire
at an oven?

78
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,056
Is this a poor people game?

79
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,991
- Yeah, it's called light
the broken pilot light

80
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,927
Without
blowing our faces off!

81
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,329
- This is ridiculous.
My heart is pounding.

82
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,032
I didn't know baking cupcakes
was an extreme sport.

83
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:48,169
It's like the deadliest batch.

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,704
- See? A slight hint of gas
in the air

85
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:52,474
Makes everything funnier.

86
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,776
Now there's too much gas.

87
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,211
If we threw a math
in there now,

88
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:57,979
I'd be out a nose or a pair
or a pair of eyebrows

89
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,581
And I'm not living through
that again.

90
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,249
- Again?

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,617
- When I was a little girl,

92
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,018
I was trying to make
a hungry man dinner

93
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,487
And I lit the pilot light
too soon and whoosh!

94
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,255
No eyebrows.

95
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,290
Had to draw them on
in magic marker.

96
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:14,629
Only mexican girls
would talk to me.

97
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,197
- Max, we have
a cupcake business.

98
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:18,466
We have to tell the landlord
we need a new oven.

99
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,568
- We can't ask the landlord
for a new oven.

100
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,271
Then he'll ask us stuff like
"who are you?

101
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:24,339
"why is your name not
on the lease,

102
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,207
And where's the rent?"

103
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,775
- Well, I'll buy us one.

104
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:30,578
- Really? You're gonna buy us
a whole oven?

105
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:35,517
We're so poor I have a sock
that I refer to as my good sock.

106
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:38,419
- I've been saving something
for an emergency,

107
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,124
Like a burst appendix
or a first date bikini wax.

108
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,559
- I knew it!

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,494
You have a secret stash of
your father's missing billions.

110
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,729
We're rich!

111
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,963
Wait, it's other people's money.

112
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,266
Yeah, but I didn't steal it.
We're rich!

113
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,635
- They're my expensive rings.

114
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:55,236
- So if these are
your expensive rings,

115
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:56,838
What's all that other stuff
you wear?

116
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,106
- Cheaper copies.

117
00:04:58,107 --> 00:04:59,974
You never wear the good stuff
out in public.

118
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:02,443
- Got it, kind of like
hiding the banana republic

119
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,312
And wearing the gap.

120
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:05,914
- See how special?

121
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,950
They're all one-of-a-kind
from thomas aristotle thomas.

122
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,485
T-a-t.
Tat.

123
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:11,653
- What?

124
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:14,222
- Tat rings.
You've never heard of tat rings?

125
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:18,626
- Oh! Tat rings.
No.

126
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:19,794
- I guess it's the kind of thing

127
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,596
That only people
in the know know, you know?

128
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:22,864
- No.

129
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,998
- Make all the jokes you want,

130
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,433
But I only have to sell
one of these

131
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:26,734
And I can get us a new oven.

132
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:28,570
Any ideas what kind
we should get?

133
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:33,474
- Uh, yeah, you're not the only
one with a secret stash.

134
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,511
It's the bluestar.

135
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,446
It's the tat rings of ovens.

136
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,481
In purple!

137
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:42,584
That's right, I said purple.

138
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:45,153
It's the muscle car of ovens.
It's bad-ass!

139
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:47,155
It's so bad-ass
when I do karaoke

140
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:52,427
I change the lyrics from
purple rain to purple range.

141
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:55,196
- Great, we'll get this one.

142
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,798
- Uh, we can't buy that.
It's too expensive.

143
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,633
This is just something
you fantasize about.

144
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,168
It's kitchen porn.

145
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,769
- Fine.

146
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,438
Tomorrow we'll go
to the cash for gold store

147
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,475
And get a regular oven
and get cookin'.

148
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:10,612
I think the funny gas is gone.

149
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,247
- Must be time.
I'm going in.

150
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:15,650
Let me do it, my eyebrows
need to waxed anyway.

151
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:20,922
- Hurry up! The gas is on!
Throw the match in!

152
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:25,426
- Did it light?
- No, but my foot is on fire.

153
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,030
I'll do it.

154
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:37,438
[both scream]

155
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,074
Both: You're good.

156
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,814
- I'm sorry, but how much longer
do we have to wait

157
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,082
To get cash for our gold?

158
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,751
- I told you before
I'm on the phone.

159
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:52,019
Sit down, shut up,
don't be rude.

160
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,288
- I thought she'd be nicer
from her picture

161
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,958
On the bus stop bench.

162
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,660
- Yeah, and where
are the dollar signs?

163
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,863
- Let me see, which ring
should I sell?

164
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,765
So much history in my lap.

165
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:07,468
- I don't even wanna tell you
about the history in my lap.

166
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,837
- My father got me this one
in london.

167
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:12,006
I got this one in paris
to reward myself

168
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,641
For not crying during
the turbulence

169
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,943
On the flight to paris.

170
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:19,747
- My mom got me a fresca when
she hit me with her car once.

171
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:21,749
- I got this one
when I was 18.

172
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,751
It was my very first tat.
- Okay, stop!

173
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,120
This was a bad idea.
Let's get out of here.

174
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,055
- I told you before.
I'm on the phone!

175
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:32,460
Sit down, shut up,
don't be rude.

176
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:33,995
- I'm only sitting down
because look.

177
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,631
She has her hand on a gun that's
strapped under the counter.

178
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:38,866
She is dying to plug us.

179
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,168
- Max, what are you
talking about?

180
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,869
Why is this a bad idea?

181
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,573
- I don't want you sacrificing
your precious rings, frodo.

182
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:46,874
Because if the business
doesn't work out,

183
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,476
It'll be my fault
you have nothing.

184
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:49,777
And call me selfish,

185
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,513
The only life I wanna ruin
is my own.

186
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,482
- Max, the business
will go up and down.

187
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,950
That's natural.

188
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:58,686
But this ring is about more than
the day to day of the business.

189
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,722
It's about us...
And our future together.

190
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:05,126
- Yo, did you just ask me
to marry you?

191
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:08,329
- You could do worse.

192
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,998
- Now, ladies, gold.
Now.

193
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,201
- Come on.
It's only one ring.

194
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,003
And when it comes to us,
I'm in this for the long haul.

195
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:18,773
- Or until this lady shoots us.

196
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,775
- Hi, I'm here to--
- come on! Let's go.

197
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:25,379
Don't push me
I'm out of nicorette.

198
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,415
- Well, you're all business,
aren't you?

199
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,983
I can respect that.

200
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,418
I'd like to exchange
a tat ring.

201
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,154
- I've never heard
of a tat ring.

202
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,656
- Thomas aristotle thomas?

203
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:37,158
World-famous designer?

204
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,629
- Yeah, talk down to me.
That'll make the price better.

205
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,065
All right, I'll weight it.

206
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,466
- What's that smell?

207
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:46,934
Is someone making soup
in the back?

208
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:49,203
- None of your business.

209
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:53,040
I will give you $275.

210
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,142
- It's worth $2,500.

211
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:58,212
- Where? In 2005?

212
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,014
- You're just taking advantage
of people

213
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,682
Because the world economy
is crashing.

214
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:08,723
- It's called cash for gold,
not sympathy for flat chicks.

215
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:10,892
- You know what?
This is inappropriate.

216
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,894
All right, I'd like to see
your business license.

217
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:14,896
Maybe I'll make a call
to the chamber of commerce.

218
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:19,000
- Oh, you will, huh?
- Duck! Here comes the gun!

219
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,036
- Maybe I'll make a call
to my boys in the back.

220
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:27,108
Sal! Richard!

221
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,111
- Oh, hello.
Let's get out of here.

222
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:35,216
- Are you sure? Because
I'm kinda feeling richard.

223
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,021
- Max, I was just
in the ladies' room

224
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,489
And I had a thought.

225
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,426
- Why am I doing my lipstick in
a mirror that says "die carlos""

226
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:46,928
- I know how to get
the full value of the ring.

227
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,896
We just have to take it to
the store where they sell it,

228
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,264
And return it.

229
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,233
- Uh, and why didn't that
occur to you before?

230
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:53,434
- 'cause I don't have
the receipt.

231
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:54,769
And I bought it
three years ago...

232
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,239
From another store...
In another country.

233
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:04,879
- The customer asked for crust
off of a turkey club.

234
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,548
- Did they say that
or is this something you say

235
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,050
That they said?

236
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:10,384
- They said it.

237
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,853
But I say I see "screw the bos""
sleeveless tee.

238
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,956
- I'm sorry,
someone call ripley's.

239
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:19,493
There is
a small mouse speaking.

240
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,662
- And I bet for sure
it comes with stinky armpits.

241
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:26,634
- Why don't you see
for yourself, ratatouille?

242
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,402
- I've gotta go.
Fight's starting.

243
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,340
- You are stinky.

244
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,275
So stinky my mother in korea
called me and said,

245
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,611
"what is that smell?"

246
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,413
- I am surprised you're upset
by man smell.

247
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:42,850
Most women like you
enjoy it.

248
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,820
- Yo, max,
I got 20 bucks on han.

249
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:48,322
He's scrappy.

250
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:49,724
- Your english is terrible.

251
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,193
- My english is less terrible
than your terrible english.

252
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,829
- What? I couldn't understand
a word you said.

253
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,732
- What? So sorry I couldn't
understand a word you said.

254
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,568
- Excuse me,
regular-sized people.

255
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,640
I am on break until
he apologizes.

256
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,907
- I think the round's over.

257
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:09,010
I couldn't understand
a word they said.

258
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,078
- He needs to apologize.
I'm the boss.

259
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,881
- Don't let him get to you,
han.

260
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,818
Every woman knows
size doesn't matter.

261
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,392
- I like your shirt.

262
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,961
Reminds me of the side of
the van I lost my virginity in.

263
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:30,064
- That little man
disrespect me.

264
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:35,970
He insult my food, my english,
my "hyjane."

265
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:38,339
- Is there anything I can do
to cheer you up?

266
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,409
- A hug would help.

267
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,611
- If I hug you,
will you go back to work?

268
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:46,614
- Yes.

269
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:49,016
- Two-second hug.
I'm going in.

270
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,124
- Aww.

271
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,527
- How did you do that?
Your hands never left my back.

272
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:02,663
- I am david blaine
of zippers.

273
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:05,199
- I was trying to cheer you up.

274
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,569
- You did.

275
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:12,807
- Wow, it's so surreal
being back here.

276
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:14,775
I grew up here.
It was like camp for me.

277
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,877
I learned who all the best
designers were,

278
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:20,648
How to color coordinate,
how to ride a bike.

279
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,783
- They let you
ride a bike here?

280
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:27,722
- Bitch, I owned this piece.

281
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,090
- If there's not
an iguana in here,

282
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,525
This place is stupid.

283
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:34,095
- Oh, my god.

284
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,363
They are such gorgeous
tat rings.

285
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:39,300
- Thanks!
- Hate you! So jealous!

286
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:43,971
- Thanks!
- Bye!

287
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,375
- Seeing you in your natural
habitat is truly disturbing.

288
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,844
- Hi! Can I help you?

289
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,913
- Hi! I'd like to return
a ring I got as a present here.

290
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,648
- Tat rings are so amazing.

291
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,083
I can't believe you want
to return it.

292
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,719
- Well, this one's from a guy
I'm no longer with,

293
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,421
So it's painful
to even look at.

294
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:01,689
- I understand.

295
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,924
But I couldn't take it back
without a receipt.

296
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,526
- The thing is
he used to hit her.

297
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:07,361
- Max! You did not!

298
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,630
- Caroline,
it's not your fault.

299
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,766
- That's awful.

300
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,768
I understand why
you wouldn't want this ring.

301
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,136
I'm sure there's something
I can do.

302
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:20,407
It's not our fault.
I mean...Your fault.

303
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,014
- Caroline channing?

304
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,048
- Jeffrey!

305
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,518
- Surprised to see me
working here?

306
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,486
Well, I got fired from
that other store

307
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,255
Whose name I will never
mention again

308
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,590
After last year's
cigarette butt incident.

309
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,058
- I'm so sorry.

310
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,694
I had no idea those menthol
slim 100s were yours.

311
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,429
I just thought so many butts
on the ground

312
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,799
Outside the store was gross,
so I said something.

313
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,401
- Well, that one comment
from the great caroline channing

314
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:50,704
About those butts
fired my little butt.

315
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,140
You'd be happy to know
that I quite smoking

316
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:56,610
After you got me fired.
Couldn't afford it.

317
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:58,946
I also couldn't afford
my gym membership.

318
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:00,681
Which is why my fired little
butt got massive,

319
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:05,085
Why no one wanted to date me,
and why I spent gay pride alone.

320
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,755
Fortunately, I wound up
working here.

321
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:11,425
- Yeah, it all worked out.
Your butt looks tight.

322
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,394
- It's halfway there.

323
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,863
- So I got the price
on the ring.

324
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:19,233
- You're buying a ring?
A tat ring?

325
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,835
- Actually, I'm returning.

326
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:24,505
- Oh, can I see the receipt?

327
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:29,276
As manager
of the jewelry department,

328
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:32,012
I couldn't possibly return
a ring that you bought

329
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:35,749
At least three years ago
without a receipt.

330
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,119
You wouldn't want me to lose
my job again, would you?

331
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,790
I got this, donna.

332
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,792
And so sorry to hear about
your father being a criminal

333
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:47,361
And you being penniless
and all that ugliness.

334
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,696
But it is kinda karma.

335
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:51,632
You are where you are now,
and I'm back on top.

336
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,601
- Look, jeffrey,
I know we just met,

337
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:58,772
But there's no way
you're a top.

338
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,012
- Now what are we gonna do?

339
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,914
- We should hunt down that super
fake jealous lady

340
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,649
Who hates you.

341
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,950
Maybe she'll buy one.

342
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,752
- Max, that's brilliant.

343
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:13,587
If anybody's gonna
buy a tat ring,

344
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,322
They're already in the store.

345
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:16,824
We can have a pop-up sale!

346
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,325
- A pop-up sale?

347
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:19,994
- You don't know
what a pop-up sale is?

348
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:22,529
- You didn't know
what a pilot light was.

349
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,764
[elevator dings]
- it's the new trend.

350
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:25,466
Mini stores pop up
and sell stuff,

351
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,800
Then they're gone.

352
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,068
- That's not a new trend.

353
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,405
Drug dealers have been
doing that for years.

354
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:34,541
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

355
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,543
- What are you doing,
beautiful mind?

356
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,579
- I'm mentally scanning
the layout of the store

357
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,947
For security cameras.

358
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,715
I knew coming here and not
going to parks as a child

359
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,150
Would pay off.

360
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,985
Okay, there's only one place
we could pull it off

361
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,287
Where there are no cameras.

362
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:47,755
- Where?

363
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:50,891
- Pop-up sale
in the ladies' room.

364
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:53,060
That's right, ma'am!

365
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:55,562
I said pop-up sale
in the ladies' room.

366
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,264
- I don't do improv.

367
00:15:57,265 --> 00:16:00,401
[elevator dings]

368
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,603
So did we sell the ring yet?

369
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:04,204
Those women weren't our
target customers.

370
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,607
We're looking for
a very specific type.

371
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:09,209
Too much style
and money to burn.

372
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,745
- [speaking arabic]
hold the elevator!

373
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,617
[speaking arabic]
and I love new york!

374
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:19,486
Both: Pop-up sale
in the ladies' room.

375
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,911
- I'll take you in
two at a time.

376
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:28,179
Let me go check
with my associate

377
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,049
And I'll be right back
for adin and lublubah.

378
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,317
- Such a good memory.

379
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:36,887
- Hard to forget
such beautiful names.

380
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:37,988
Ready?

381
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,825
- We have a pooper
in stall two.

382
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:44,628
- Who shops and plops?
I mean, really.

383
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,799
- Trust me, I smell the match.
Classic shop and plop cover-up.

384
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,035
- Where are the two kit kats
we got from the vending machine?

385
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,037
- I told you I was hungry.

386
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:55,439
- Arabic women expect a gift
when they buy something.

387
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,607
- Well, stall number two

388
00:16:56,608 --> 00:17:00,010
Will probably supply
a little present.

389
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,579
- Hi, are you here
for the pop-up sale?

390
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,114
- No, I just have to pee.
- Oh, geez.

391
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,449
Come on,
don't waste my time!

392
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,384
One stall's open--in and out!
Running a business!

393
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:10,287
- That woman pushed
ahead of us.

394
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:11,622
Do not sell her
my tat ring.

395
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,124
- It's fun.
You're here to pick up

396
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,727
She's here to drop off.

397
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:19,130
Open the shop.

398
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,231
We're a good team.

399
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:21,699
You set 'em up,
I knock 'em down.

400
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,569
- Why is [indistinct]?
- I don't know, it just is.

401
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,638
Are you here
for the pop-up sale?

402
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,540
- A pop-sale in the bathroom?

403
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,775
So lame.
- So lame.

404
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:34,044
Caroline?
- Jen, robin!

405
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,346
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

406
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,048
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.

407
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,252
- Excuse me.
When will pop-up sale start?

408
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:45,189
We have lunch reservations for
five at four seasons at 3:00.

409
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,024
- Why are you asking me?

410
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,727
- You two are doing
pop-up sale, no?

411
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,228
- No.

412
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:54,632
I have nothing to do with this
pop-up sale in the bathroom.

413
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,000
- So lame.
- So lame.

414
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,234
- So lame!

415
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,569
- So lame.

416
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,837
- Come to lunch with us.

417
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:00,871
- Oh, I've already eaten.

418
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,540
- Our treat.

419
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,674
- We are not taking no
for an answer.

420
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,142
- They're not taking no
for an answer.

421
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,410
Sell the ring.

422
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:09,780
- Where is she going?
I thought you two were a team.

423
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,750
- Apparently not.

424
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,120
- So sorry.

425
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:18,889
I got caught up in a hostage
nicoise situation.

426
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,890
How'd it go?

427
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,091
Did you get full price
for the ring?

428
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:23,827
- Oh, do you know me?

429
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:25,996
Because I couldn't sworn
you didn't know me.

430
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:29,033
My new friends adin
and lablueballs

431
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:30,434
Thought it was weird
that you just bailed on me.

432
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,570
- Max, I panicked
in the moment.

433
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,071
I didn't want those girls
telling everyone

434
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,041
That caroline channing was in
a bathroom selling her jewelry.

435
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,643
I'm barely back on my feet
after the whole scandal.

436
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:43,647
I just couldn't bare it.

437
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:45,316
- Here.

438
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,784
I didn't sell them
because I didn't buy the whole

439
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:49,253
"in it for the long haul"
thing from the beginning.

440
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,988
And I was right
because I'm always right

441
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,157
About people
in the long haul.

442
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,858
- Max, I'm talking to you.

443
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,927
- It's cool.
We don't need to talk.

444
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:03,701
- Max, about the rings,
I'm sorry.

445
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:04,935
I don't know what else
to say.

446
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,437
- You don't need to say
anything.

447
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,472
You already said a lot of words
about the future and us,

448
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:11,275
And then next thing I know,
you were "oh, my god!"

449
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,110
Off to lunch
with your friends.

450
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,012
- Max, I am in this
for the long haul.

451
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,914
Isn't there anything I can say
to convince you of that?

452
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,083
- Nope.
And it's fine.

453
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,584
It's not you, it's me.

454
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:21,852
I'm the idiot who actually
believed for a minute

455
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,020
That we had a future.

456
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:24,488
But it's okay.

457
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:26,857
We'll just keep getting by
like we are, for the short haul.

458
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,425
Cool?

459
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:31,095
- Max.

460
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,504
Hey!
- Hey.

461
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:43,507
What's that smell?
- I'm making cupcakes.

462
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:47,678
- You lit the pilot light?
- Didn't have to. Look.

463
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:53,083
- No way!
The bluestar in purple?

464
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,385
What the--
how did it get--

465
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,287
How can--
how could you afford that?

466
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,322
You sold your tat?
- Sold them all.

467
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,358
Spent it on the oven, next-day
delivery fee and installation.

468
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,960
- That woman gave you
a better price?

469
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:05,195
- No, she pulled a gun on me.

470
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,730
So I went to every gold store
in brooklyn,

471
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,432
Leveraged their offers
against each other

472
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,401
Until I got enough to buy
the bluestar.

473
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:12,503
- You didn't have to do that.

474
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,172
- After what I did,
there were no more words.

475
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,640
Only ovens.

476
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:19,376
And our future means more to me
than rings from my past.

477
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:22,846
I told you, I'm in this
for the long haul.

478
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,917
For the record, I hated lunch
with those girls.

479
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:30,587
I'd rather split a kit kat
in a bathroom with you any day.

480
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:32,222
- I'm sorry
I wasn't listening.

481
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:35,059
I was staring at my new
boyfriend over there.

482
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,861
I wanna make out with it!

483
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,096
[giggling]

484
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:40,864
Ooh.
Ow! Hot!

485
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,266
[oven dings]

486
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,201
There's not a ding!

487
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:48,172
- There's a ding.
My rings bought a ding.

488
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:50,274
You wanna hug me, don't you?

489
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:52,509
- Yeah.

490
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,212
- But you're not gonna.
- Yes, I am.

491
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:59,750
If you unzip my shirt,
I'm gonna be pissed!

492
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:02,152
Impressed, but pissed.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
