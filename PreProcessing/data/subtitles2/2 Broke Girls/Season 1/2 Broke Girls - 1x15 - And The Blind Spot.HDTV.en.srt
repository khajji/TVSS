Yes.

But it's always well-lit,

your cleaning company.

Yeah, she wants to do it for
money to pay for our website,

Have you cleaned houses before?

But whatever the task,
you won't be sorry.

78

Max and I are a great team,

79
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:29,443

something, we accomplish it.

80

Oh, okay.

92
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,988
Well, uh, you walk out your door,

93
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,407
you take right, you go upstairs,

94
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,977
you open my door, and
you clean my apartment.

95
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,863
Is audition.

96
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:08,499

101
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,842
Yes.

102

Good boy. Now go.

103
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,339

104
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:32,557
This is getting dicey.

105
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,808

That's the future of our company.

109

But the future is so far in the future,

110
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,771

now for real stuff,

111

Besides, we don't need the website yet.

115
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,083
We got the birthday cupcake
job tomorrow without it.

116
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,285
And where do you think we got that job?

117
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,788
I don't know, the job fairy?

118
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,590
What? I don't pay attention
to the business stuff.

119
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,658
I got the order at the
web design company

120
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,494
when I overheard someone say it
was his son's fifth birthday.

121
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:09,513
Gross. Using children

122
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:12,716
Way to go, China.

123
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:18,806
Well, here we are.

124
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:20,891
Why is this big news?

125
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:22,476
Come in.

126
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,396
So, if this all works out today,

127
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:29,533
I have two possible jobs for you.

128
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:30,784
Two? That's amazing.

129

This is the only way

130
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:35,739

company's good name.

131
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:39,910
'Cause I work hard to
build "Sophie's choice."

132
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:41,912
Now, uh, one of you take bathroom

133
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,247

Who does which?

135
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:45,916
Bathroom. I'm going to go with bathroom.

136
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:47,367
I love a challenge.

137
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:50,587
If not perfect clean, no job.

138
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,539
Begin.

139
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,425
Watch out, ladies.

140
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:57,895
I'm about to go ham on this b-room.

141
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:00,547
What is this "ham"?

142
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:02,516
Hard as a mother.

143
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:07,054

You clean

147
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,921
Roar of cleaning.

148
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,456
No big deal.

149
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,624
I was lifting up couches when I was six

150
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:31,128
to help my mom look for change
and her boyfriend's tooth.

151
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,897
I'm almost finished in here!

152
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,883
This one like to make big announcements

153
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,770
- about nothing, yes?
- Yes.

154

Hey, does that electric cigarette work?

155
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:42,923
Yes, yeah.

156
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:47,399
I smoked for seven years, and
then I quit when I was 12.

157
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:50,447
Yeah, I didn't want
to die of lung cancer

158
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,933
before I was teenager.

159
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:54,451
Can I get a hit?

160
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,453
Oh, yeah, please, try.

161
00:06:56,455 --> 00:07:00,157
I have many more in the drawers.

162
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,659
I smoked the summer I shucked
oysters on a gay cruise.

163
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:05,746
Ooh, glamorous.

164
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:07,965
Almost done. Two-minute warning.

165
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,467
Be prepared to be amazed.

166
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,752
Max, you shouldn't smoke. You'll get...

167
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:14,138
What, electrocuted?

168
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,472
This is silly.

169
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,474
If I'm going to suck
on something this hard

170
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:21,311
and get no pleasure out of it,
I should just date.

171
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:24,431
I think you're going to be thrilled.

172
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:30,470
Oh, she stinks.

173
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:33,273
Spritz, spritz. She is sprayer.

174
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,659
All mirror, no toilet.

175
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,611
Well, you know, she's sort
of new to this kind of work.

176
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:38,829
She was born rich,

177
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,664
but her father stole a bunch
of money from people,

178
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,417
and she was thrown out of her
townhouse and disgraced.

179
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,920
Yes, well, she clean like rich girl.

180
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,173
"Hey, everybody, look,
look what I'm doing.

181
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,925
Oh, spritz, spritz."

182
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,994
Oh!

183
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:55,596
See, you not born rich,

184
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,999
and you... you're like "roar."

185
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,517
- Right?
- Well.

186
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,470
Cleaning's not her thing, but
she has other strengths.

187
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,172
Mm, I don't see them.

188
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:06,557
Mm.

189
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:09,693
Uh, so do we not have the job?

190
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:10,978
No, I give you job,

191
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,513
because one bull equal two girls.

192
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:16,349
But why you need her, I don't know.

193
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,702
You can make much more
money on your own.

194
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,854
Yeah, well, we're kind of a team.

195
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:24,541
Listen, Max. Let me tell you something.

196
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:28,378
She is like rock, tied to you, balloon.

197
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,697
See, she hold you down.

198
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,040
You cut her loose, and...

199
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,890
Yeah, well, she's not weighing me down.

200
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:43,043
I had lover who was rock.

201
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:47,030
And I let him go, and...

202
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:51,051
I'm finished, and I have
to say, that bathroom?

203
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,269
Nailed it.

204
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,720
Don't push it. She saw it.

205
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:56,240
She barely looked at it.
I saw you in the mirror.

206
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:57,825
Your eye never even looked down.

207
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:01,528
Yes, that's because this
eye doesn't go down.

208
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,396
See, I'm trying.

209
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:07,251
Yeah, I have blind spot
from accident as child.

210
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:09,203
When I was six years old,

211
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,505
while working in Polish knock-off

212
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,757
of McDonalds in warsaw,

213
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,927
I fell on hot McStick.

214
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,746
How did you fall on a hot stick?

215
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:23,600
Not a stick that is hot. A hot McStick.

216
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,720
It's meat on a stick,
and it's very popular.

217
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:29,473
They only have it, like,
two times a year.

218
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,859
It's like Mcribs.

219
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:36,363
Sophie, I'm so sorry, that's awful.

220
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,949
Yeah, but I bet that McStick
thing is delicious.

221
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,617
It is.

222
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:41,785
Well, that must have been hard.

223
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,453
I admire your courage.

224
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:46,773
What are you, counsellor from UNICEF?

225
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:50,627
You are acing this interview.

226
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,113
Pffft...

227
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,795
Do you know where we are?

228
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,496
This whole building is models.

229
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,064
Life is so funny.

230
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,499
When I lived in Manhattan,

231
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,885
I used to come to model
parties here all the time.

232
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,336
And now you clean up their poop.

233
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:17,173
You're right. Life is funny.

234
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,674
Here's the apartment upstairs tomorrow.

235
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:21,393
- 10 J. Here it is.
- How do I look?

236
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:23,729
Maybe he's the Abercrombie
model from the Christmas ad

237
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:24,930
in the white sleigh

238
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:28,550
with the open fleece
jacket and the eight-pack.

239
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:32,488
I don't think it's him.

240
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,439
Hi, I'm Big Bill.

241
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:34,607
Come on in, girlies.

242
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,193
How many packs did you say?

243
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:40,029
Oh, what a lovely... oh!

244
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,748
Oh, my God.

245
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,533
Look, Max, he's a figure skater.

246
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,202
Go ahead, take it all in.

247
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:47,753
How could you not?

248
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,922
It's okay, I'm a model. I'm used to it.

249
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,241
Hey, I know you. You're <i>the</i> Big Bill.

250
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:53,843
You're the guy from the
gag greeting cards.

251
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:56,428
Yep. I sold 2 million of
that particular card.

252
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,763
On the front it says, "You're on,"

253
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:59,014
when you open it up...

254
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,466
- "Thin ice"!
- Right.

255
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:02,852
Oh, I've got to go in
my bedroom and change.

256
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:05,271
I'll be right back.

257
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:06,388
Wow, Big Bill!

258
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,907
No, big bye-bye.

259
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,191
We're not staying here.

260
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,192
If that's what's on the wall,

261
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:11,426
who knows what's on the floor.

262
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:13,229
Or trapped underneath it.

263
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:14,897
This is an uncomfortable
work environment.

264
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,700
You were going to be on all
fours scrubbing a toilet.

265
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:20,936
It was always going to be an
uncomfortable work environment.

266
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,454
Okay, if we're staying,
that's three times

267
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,040
the amount of man.
We should get double the money.

268
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,158
I'm calling Sophie right now

269
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,459
and telling her we should get more.

270
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:29,444
Um, I would not suggest
you complain to Sophie.

271
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:30,496
It's not a good idea.

272
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:32,631
Why? Do you know something I don't?

273
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,283
She thinks you don't know how to clean,

274
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,385
that you spritz, spritz.

275
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,387
And what does she say about
your cleaning skills?

276
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,422
I'm a bull and I roar.

277
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,974
I knew she didn't like me.

278
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:44,093
She only has eye for you.

279
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:46,562
Who cares what she thinks.
Just clean better today.

280
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:48,564
You do the living room.
I'll do the bathroom.

281
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,983
No, I'll do the bathroom,
just to prove a point.

282
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,518
I mean, reprove it.

283
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,519
This is just like when

284
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,104
they made me take the S.A.T.S again,

285
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:59,775
away from all the asian kids.

286
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:02,244
Oh! Oh, my God!

287
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,080
Why are you freaking out?

288
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,448
You've already seen him naked.

289
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,482
It's not him.

290
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:10,194
Have you seen the size of this toilet?

291
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,458
That is a big-ass toilet.

292
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,295
Literally.

293
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,552
Max, I'm finished.

294
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:28,387
The floor is so clean
you could eat off it,

295
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,122
and I'm sure he will.

296
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,608
Come on in, I want you to see it.

297
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,109
No, no, no, no, no, no.

298
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:36,562
Go down, go down, stop. Never mind!

299
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,398
Don't need you to see it.
Everything's okay.

300
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,700
How's it going out there?

301
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:45,020
Either your water just broke,
or you pee like a smurf.

302
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,288
My shoes.

303
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,908
No, you did not flush a
whole roll of paper towels.

304
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,027
No, you did not just
use that tone with me

305
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,245
when my good shoes are wet.

306
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:54,246
Shut off the valve.

307
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:55,297
The valve?

308
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,583
Oh, God, what is wrong with you?

309
00:12:57,585 --> 00:13:00,085
How can you not know
where a toilet valve is?

310
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,337
I was rich.

311
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:02,888
But you have to admit, the mirror?

312
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,225
Nailed it.

313
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,885
Wake up, you lazy bitch!

314
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,070
- What?
- Fire!

315
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,322
I'm fired? Why, because of the toilet?

316
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,408
Look at the oven, the cupcakes.

317
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,777
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

318
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,829
I was just going to lay
down for five minutes.

319
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:28,530
I asked you to do one thing

320
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:30,199
while I went out to get more milk...

321
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:33,035
Take the cupcakes out of the oven.

322
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:36,038
"Happy Birthday, kids.
From Max's homemade cupcakes.

323
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,791
"You can learn more about us
and our blackened cupcakes

324
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,076
on our expensive website."

325
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:42,428
I'm sorry, Max.

326
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,214
I just really needed a little
siesta after all that cleaning.

327
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:48,767
How are you so good at Spanish
and so bad at cleaning?

328
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,920
What is that smell?

329
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,722
I grabbed my purse and ran.

330
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,774
Caroline burned cupcakes.

331
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:58,310
Oh, so sad.

332
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,263
Look at all those burnt cakes.

333
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,815
What happened here?

334
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,116
Just a little mishap.

335
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:06,452
I was so tired from cleaning
that bathroom earlier,

336
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,103
that I laid my head
down for five minutes

337
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,939
- and ended up falling asleep.
- Aw...

338
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,925
Such a shame.

339
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:16,462
Oh, look Max.

340
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:19,081
These cupcakes, they're hard as rocks.

341
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,632
All you have to do

342
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:24,480
is throw the rock away, and whee!

343
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,070
I don't think Sophie likes me.

344
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,789
What are you talking about?
She loves you.

345
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,758
No. I don't think she has a blind spot.

346
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,694
I think she has a blonde spot... for me.

347
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,799
Well, I think we've found the place

348
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:51,386
where red bulls come to die.

349
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:54,589
Man, why do I never get
invited to parties like this?

350
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,758
Look. Do you know what that means?

351
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,977
Yeah, this building has
a real shirt shortage.

352
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,612
Oh, my God, do you think

353
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:02,280
this might be the Abercrombie
model's apartment?

354
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:05,099
I doubt it's the Abercrombie
model's apartment.

355
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:06,118
Here's a note.

356
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,486
It's addressed to "cleaning dood,"

357
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:09,771
"dude" spelled "d-o-o-d."

358
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:13,241
It definitely might be the
Abercrombie model's apartment.

359
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,710
"Wake me when you get here
." He wants us to wake him.

360
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:18,163
So, do you think he sleeps in the nude?

361
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,832
Yeah, "nood", "n-o-o-d."

362
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,584
Come on, let's go look.

363
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:24,619
Oh, oh, oh, so what,
seeing this guy naked

364
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:27,121
is no longer an "uncomfortable
work environment"?

365
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:28,140
It's still uncomfortable,

366
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:30,509
but in that exciting uncomfortable way.

367
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:35,597
I think it is him.

368
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,899
It's the guy who put the
"abs" in Abercrombie.

369
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,602
And he's naked. The good naked.

370
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:41,987
Should we lift the sheet?

371
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:44,272
Why not? I already lifted it in my mind.

372
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:45,357
Max, I got this.

373
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:48,476
You start cleaning up
the mess out there.

374
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,829
No, you start cleaning the
mess out there... I got this.

375
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,164
The bedroom's attached to the bathroom,

376
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,816
and I always do the bathrooms,
and he's my ideal type.

377
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:56,818
And by "doing" the bathrooms
do you mean flooding them,

378
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,486
and by "ideal type," do
you mean unconscious?

379
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:00,321
Shh! We can talk about this out here.

380
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:01,790
You're going to wake him.

381
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,108
That's what we're supposed to do.

382
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,262
But as usual, you don't
want to do the job.

383
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:10,048
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

384
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,516
Well, why should I have to
do all the heavy lifting

385
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,302
while you just get to nap
and see free model penis?

386
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,521
All the heavy lifting?
Where'd you get that from?

387
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:17,689
No one.

388
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,690
Sophie.

389
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:20,725
I knew she didn't like me.

390
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,110
It's not that she doesn't like you,

391
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,028
she just doesn't think you're...

392
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,529
What? Doing anything?

393
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:25,847
She thinks I'm not pulling my weight?

394
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:26,865
She thinks I'm dead weight?

395
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:30,318
Not dead weight, more like... a rock...

396
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,287
To my balloon.

397
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,657
What is that, some kind of Polish haiku?

398
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,125
What does that even mean?

399
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:42,030
She thinks if I cut the rock
loose, I'll go... fuuuuu!

400
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,548
Wait, so you're siding with

401
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,366
a woman you met a week ago over me?

402
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:47,502
I'm not siding with anyone.
I'm just saying...

403
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:50,138
I know what this is.
This is "Pick on the rich girl."

404
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,257
It's a poverty smackdown.

405
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,476
I heard you two talking while
I was in her bathroom,

406
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,795
spritz spritzing.

407
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:59,264
You think you do everything?
Fine, do everything.

408
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,516
You can "balloon" all over this place,

409
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,986
'cause the "rock" is leaving.

410
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:11,225
Who is it?

411
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:13,612
You're the rock! I'm the balloon!

412
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:16,064
Without me lifting you out
of your negative rockness,

413
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,699
you wouldn't even have
a cupcake business.

414
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,734
I'm the reason we even
have cupcake jobs.

415
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:20,919
Oh, oh, you're the reason?

416
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,788
Who stayed up all last night
baking 24 more cupcakes

417
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,090
while you were sleeping?

418
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,626
You did. And who delivered
the cupcakes this morning

419
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,762
while you were sleeping?
I did. Me. The balloon.

420
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:33,848
I floated over there and got
paid for the job that I got us

421
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,134
from the website that
I'm trying to pay for.

422
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,585
And now, I'm going to
float down this hall

423
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:40,522
and wake the hot model up
'cause, contrary to what you

424
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:42,256
and your poverty gal-pal might think,

425
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:43,892
I always do the job I'm hired for.

426
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:45,810
Oh, no! I am going to wake him up.

427
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:48,480
Free model penis is my
reward for doing everything

428
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:51,733
and being tied to a rock like you.

429
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,351
Oh, see? I can't get away,
because you're the rock

430
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:56,855
and you're heavier than my balloon.

431
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:59,824
Hey, stop!

432
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:01,493
This is cleaning job,

433
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:05,030
not gorgeous ladies of wrestling.

434
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,447
Good thing I stopped by to check on you.

435
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,783
- What is all this?
- You explain it.

436
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:10,635
I'm going to go wake the hot model up.

437
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,754
He left a note. Just doing my job.

438
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,055
As usual.

439
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,312
So, you think I'm holding Max back?

440
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,314
What kind of question is this?

441
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:24,182
Yes.

442
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:27,135
Well, you're wrong. We're a great team.

443
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,853
And, yes, there are some
things she's better at.

444
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,139
But there are other areas where I excel.

445
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,274
Well, I don't see them.

446
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:35,356
That's probably because of your eye.

447
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,147
Did you wake him up?

448
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,017
Uh, no. I think he might be dead.

449
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,541
Oh, no, not the hot one!

450
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,676
Aw, he's my favorite.

451
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,494
This is all I need on yelp.

452
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:55,880
We should call 911.

453
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:57,349
No, I got it.

454
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,968
What are you going to do?

455
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,187
I'm going to give him mouth-to-mouth.

456
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:15,283
I didn't know there was
so much tongue involved.

457
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:17,351
This is not working.

458
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:19,187
But, you know what?
I know he's still alive,

459
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:23,625
because his manhood is
knocking on my lady door.

460
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,953
He must have taken too many
of those pills on the table.

461
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:36,504
Pills? I got this.

462
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,206
Max, go get some hydrogen peroxide.

463
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:41,509
- Sophie, step aside, now.
- Oh, all right.

464
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:42,877
You sure you know what you're doing?

465
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:45,046
My friend Candace travelstead
od'd like three times

466
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:49,250
in college, and I
brought her back twice.

467
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:50,351
There you go.

468
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,936
Bring him up.

469
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:56,024
Max, you hold his head back,
open his mouth.

470
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,595
Back up.

471
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:12,161
I'm starting to see your worth.

472
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:20,832
What? You're being subway creepy.

473
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,583
I have to say, when you were punching

474
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:24,085
that almost-dead guy in the stomach,

475
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:26,254
that was a serious balloon move.

476
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:28,389
The truth is, we're both balloons.

477
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:31,959
Yeah, but mine is, like,
way cooler than yours.

478
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:34,312
It's like one of those silver
ones that never goes out of air.

479
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,130
They don't make those anymore.
They're toxic.

480
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:38,599
Exactly.

481
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:41,319
Max, you know you won't let
me come into the kitchen

482
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,803
and help you bake, right?

483
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:44,739
And you know that I
know that without you,

484
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:47,492
the job fairy would
never show up, right?

485
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,161
But if you ever need me to
help you bake, I could.

486
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:51,145
No, it's cool.

487
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,830
You do your thing, I'll do mine.

488
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:54,032
Hey, get your phone.

489
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:55,950
We should capture this
near-death victory moment

490
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:57,168
as our website picture.

491
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,419
Totally.

492
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:02,367
On the count of three, think...
"We made $200."

493
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,709
One... two...

494
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,127
Hold up.

495
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,929
Sir, if you want to go
home with that hand,

496
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:10,331
get it off my ass.

497
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,366
Okay, three.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
