00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,049
It's the woman at table 2's 50th birthday
and her husband wants us to sing to her.

3
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:08,021
If I had a dollar every time a man
asked me to do something to his wife,

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,181
I'd be a millionaire.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,248
I remember when
Happy Birthday first came up.

6
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,756
I never thought it would catch on.

7
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:18,800
Go!

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,230
And smile.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,696
When you fake smile,

10
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:23,641
everybody else fakes smile back.

11
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,283
Nobody wants to hear that lame song.

12
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,343
If we want to humiliate her in public, why
don't we go over there and pull her top down?

13
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,519
Come on, let's just go sing
and make the best of it.

14
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,258
Ready?

00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:39,906

18

I apologize.

19
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:54,897
It's hard enough your husband took you
to a diner on your birthday

20
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:56,690
and now you have to listen to white Mariah?

21
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:58,101
No!

00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,251

25
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,396
I have announcement to make.

26
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:31,283
I agree with what Max said before.

27
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:32,984
What? That we should tie
a little bell around you,

28
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:39,624
so we know when you're near?

29
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:41,343
The diner needs a fresh, new way

30
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,328
to celebrate the customer birthday.

31
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,598
So I just went
and wrote a special song.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Han, I'd be happy to look
at what you've written so far.

33
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,468
I took music theory in college.

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,554
I once wrote
an entire original musical

35
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:54,189
based on the French revolution.

36
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,674
Um, sorry to step on your nerd turf,

37
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:59,778
<i>but Les Mis is already a musical
about the French revolution.</i>

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,114
Yes, but mine was from
the point of view of the rich.

39
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,233
What are you going
to rewrite next--

40
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:08,987
<i>the musical rent from the point
of view of the landlord?</i>

41
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:12,624
Han, this is
a lovely start, but--

42
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:13,992
A lovely start?

43
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,410
No, I mean, it's good.

44
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:16,578
But not good enough.

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,879
I know what you are saying.

46
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,864
"You need to practice more, Han.

47
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,967
"You never will be
as good as your sister, Han.

48
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,701
"Whole family going on vacation

49
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,720
without you
while you practice, Han."

50
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,839
Back off, tiger mom!

51
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:32,260
Hey, Caroline, is Max around?

52
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:35,413
Um, she might be.
I'll go check.

53
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,767
You'll never guess who
just came into the restaurant.

54
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,068
You'll be very happy.

55
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,821
<i>Gary, the fat guy from teen mom?</i>

56
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:45,073
Someone you like,
someone you want to kiss,

57
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,358
someone you're hot for.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,110
<i>Tyler, the skinny guy from teen mom?</i>

59
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:51,446
What's Johnny doing here?

60
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:52,781
I told him not
to show his face unless--

61
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:54,449
Unless he broke up
with his girlfriend.

62
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,234
And now he's here, showing his face,

63
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,286
- which means--
- You can't know that for sure.

64
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,672
Fine. Tell me one other reason
he could possibly be in here.

65
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:03,041
He needs Han to solve
a complex math problem?

66
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,876
Max!

67
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,178
Max, it's pretty obvious
that he's in here

68
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,880
because he broke up
with his girlfriend "Cassandra"

69
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:10,415
I mean, what else could it be?

70
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,683
When I had millions of dollars,

71
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,601
I had no idea
why guys were coming to see me.

72
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:15,420
"Do they want me,
or do they want my money?"

73
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:16,921
But you have nothing!

74
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,357
So basically that just leaves you.

75
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,926
Way to puff me up
before I go through that door.

76
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,478
This is so exciting.

77
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,597
Will you stop?
Don't be such a girl.

78
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,900
Hair? Teeth? Anything?

79
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:30,235
You're good.

80
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,653
Wait.

81
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,774
More.

82
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:41,413
- Really?
- Trust me.

83
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:50,305
Oh, uh, hey, Johnny.
When did you get here?

84
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:51,506
Uh, just now.

85
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:52,757
I, uh--I came here

86
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,625
because I want to tell you something.

87
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,128
Yes?

88
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,482
Max, I think you and I
have something special.

89
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,767
And I don't want to lose that.

90
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,520
So I came down here to ask...

91
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,572
Even though it didn't work out,

92
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:08,857
can we still be friends?

93
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,742
- Oh.
- What?

94
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:13,328
You have got to be kidding!

95
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,529
Oh.
[Clears throat]

96
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,980
What's going on over there, Caroline?

97
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:17,999
My friend Johnny and I have no idea

98
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,367
what you're upset about.

99
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:22,153
I was just reacting to the
news that we're out of pie.

100
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:24,005
<i>I really cannot believe it.</i>

101
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,374
I totally thought it would go
a different way.

102
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:28,376
Caroline...

103
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:31,096
Why don't you go over there
to the pie carrousel

104
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,548
and mourn the loss of our pie?

105
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,335
So, we're cool?

106
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,137
Yeah, we're cool.
Why wouldn't we be?

107
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,189
We never dated or anything like that.

108
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,557
Of course we're friends.

109
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,725
I am so relieved.

110
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,777
So, uh, you gonna go back

111
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,779
to busting my balls, like always?

112
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,397
Yes.
[Laughs]

113
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,483
We're such good friends,
I might just...

114
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,902
Bust them with my feet!

115
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,374
Good morning.

116
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,876
I'm trying to send out
a get-to-know-us email blast

117
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,044
for the cupcake business.

118
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,496
But your wi-fi is so slow.

119
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:07,532
Don't tell me--
tell cathyhome17,

120
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,217
whoever and wherever she is.

121
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:10,335
Okay, well, I'm just going

122
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,053
to run down to the coffee place
and send it.

123
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,037
Do you approve?

124
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
Nice job.
The font's pretty.

125
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,724
You just gave me a compliment?

126
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,092
I knew it--
you're depressed.

127
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:19,644
You're so depressed

128
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,929
about you and Johnny
just being friends,

129
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:22,897
you don't even have the energy
to be you.

130
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,399
What?
The font is pretty.

131
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,818
Oh, honey, do you want a hug?

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,654
- I'm fine.
- How could you be fine?

133
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,022
The man was so into you,

134
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:33,024
he painted a billboard
of the two of you kissing.

135
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:34,559
And now he just wants to be friends?

136
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:37,028
Please call in sick
to your babysitting job

137
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,329
and take to the bed.

138
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:39,697
Whenever I used to get depressed,

139
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:40,748
I'd take to the bed.

140
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,917
One time, I took to the bed
for a week.

141
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,119
Listen, unlike you, Jane Austen,

142
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,704
I will never take to the bed.

143
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:49,240
Giving into feelings
is for rich people.

144
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,792
Regular people just have to get up,

145
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:54,712
get drunk, and go fulfill
their babysitting duties.

146
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,914
Max, take to the bed.

147
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,634
Look, this is my pattern, okay?

148
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:01,019
I fall for the wrong guy,

149
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:03,021
I find out they're with a girl,
a bottle, or a needle,

150
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,222
and I move on.

151
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,641
And sometimes I use a bottle
to help me do it...

152
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:09,644
Or a needle or a girl.

153
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:12,780
But when I'm done, I'm done.

154
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:13,982
That's it?

155
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,033
You're just over it?

156
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,484
Wow.

157
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:19,120
I'm still sad because
Kyle Enright didn't invite me

158
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:22,290
on his private jet to Mykonos
for his 12th birthday.

159
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,292
Well, not me.

160
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:27,045
Just flip a switch
and those feelings are gone.

161
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,913
I only have two switches
in my life--

162
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,715
one turns off my emotions,

163
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:33,418

Max.

Are you about to come
over here and soft-touch me?

it's such short notice--

because I'm a genius--

No way. I can't make
100 cupcakes in a day.

"take me off!"

And I'm like,
"no, pants."

I almost couldn't help myself.

What happened to your pattern?

Telling people I have a
pattern is part of the pattern.

with his girlfriend.

our cupcake future,

and I don't want half
of our future's frosting

00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,101
It's Cash-andra, actually.

323
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:26,402
But everyone calls me Cash.

324
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,137
And you're Max's
business partner, right?

325
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,240
Yeah, but she makes her own decisions.

326
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,910
Right. Well, let's just
get to it, shall we?

327
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,611
I'm a bleeder.

328
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,580
It's brilliant it all worked out

329
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,982
- with the cupcakes.
- Excuse me?

330
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:41,617
Well, I told Traive
to hire you for the show.

331
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:44,420
Johnny cannot stop talking
about your cupcakes, Max.

332
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,255
"Max's cupcakes are so moist."

333
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:47,924
"Max's cupcakes are delicious."

334
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,675
He loves your cupcakes.

335
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,327
[Chuckling awkwardly] Yeah, yeah.

336
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,328
But just like in a casual way.

337
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,181
I mean, he barely even touched them.

338
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,967
So, um, I'm a bit busy
getting ready for the show.

339
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:00,053
Why don't you put your little
cupcakes on these trays,

340
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,438
and when people start coming in,
circulate, right?

341
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,424
Circulate, girls, circulate.

342
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,644
Well, that wasn't uncomfortable.

343
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,813
Come on, let's bolt
before Johnny gets here,

344
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:12,615
while I at least have
a shred of my dignity.

345
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,534
We can't just bail out
of our first big job.

346
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,369
If we do,
people will think we're flakes.

347
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,704
And that'll spread faster
through Williamsburg

348
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,206
than knit hats and herpes.

349
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,625
Hey, you ladies know
where the wine goes?

350
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:23,743
- Oh--
- Right here.

351
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:26,079
Yeah.

352
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:26,278
+

353
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,169
No! Just, uh, not the wine.
The wine's mine.

354
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,271
Just serving cupcakes.

355
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:40,007
I've been listening in on Cashandra

356
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,359
and her girlfriends' conversations,

357
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,810
and I don't think she knows
anything happened

358
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:43,894
between you two.

359
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:45,512
I also learned she's a dancer,

360
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:46,680
her lip gloss is from Kiehl's,

361
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:48,866
and she's school chums with Adele.

362
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,351
<i>Not the Adele.</i>

363
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:53,537
Damn it!
Could she be any cooler?

364
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,072
I want her to be my girlfriend.

365
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,325
I wouldn't break up with her for me.

366
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,543
Hi. I'm here.

367
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:02,330
Great. I was hoping
tonight would get weirder.

368
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,649
I had no idea.

369
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:05,966
She did it to surprise me.

370
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,534
And she did--
I'm surprised.

371
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,470
I am so sorry.

372
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:11,806
You have a girlfriend.
Why are you kissing Max?

373
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:13,040
You told her?

374
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,392
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:15,926
Would the more subtle way
be to paint a picture

376
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:19,313
and hang it on the wall
for all to see?

377
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:20,681
Are you insane?

378
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,683
Could we have a moment, please?

379
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:23,734
Fine.

380
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:26,103
I'll be over there near the ice penis.

381
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:30,441
Look, I am so sorry.

382
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:32,777
If I had known Cash was going
to ask you to do all of this,

383
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,061
I would have told you.

384
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:35,896
And why would you choose to hang that?

385
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,782
'Cause it's my favorite piece.

386
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,000
Is there any way
she could know what happened?

387
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,253
No.

388
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,338
- Oh, my God. Your lips.
- Split up.

389
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,740
I can smell the sex
from across the room.

390
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:52,129
No-whoa-whoa!
I need all those.

391
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:54,098
So what?
Is she still your girlfriend?

392
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,466
Max, it's complicated.

393
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:58,018
What, are we on Facebook?

394
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,921
<i>It is complicated.</i>

395
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,256
Cash and I have been together
two years,

396
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:03,441
- and when--
- Two years?

397
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:04,809
Jeez, I'm a home wrecker.

398
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:08,229
Adele will probably write
a song about me.

399
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,648
You're not a homewrecker.

400
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,266
- I am.
- Johnny!

401
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,402
You've got some folks.

402
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,937
Circulate, Max, circulate.

403
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,458
That's it.
This is over.

404
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,461
That--us on the wall--
never happens again.

405
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,079
I lied.
I can't be your friend.

406
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:27,214
I was trying to be cool,
but I'm not cool.

407
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:29,166
I don't know Adele.

408
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:32,420
What just happened over there?
Did he tell you

409
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,787
he's breaking up with his girlfriend?

410
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,006
No.
What's wrong with you?

411
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:37,975
You haven't been right about anything?

412
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:41,395
I told him we are done,
and that's over, okay?

413
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,981
They've been together two years.

414
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:46,650
And I know one thing about me--
I may pick the wrong guys,

415
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:48,469
but when I hear
another woman is involved,

416
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,520
I am done.

417
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:52,773
This is truly the end of my pattern.

418
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,575
We have to go--
I kissed Johnny again.

419
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:55,993
What?
Max, you said

420
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:57,278
you were going to the bathroom.

421
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,829
I did.
And so did he.

422
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,164
It's a unisex bathroom--

423
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,950
emphasis on the sex.

424
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,084
We have to go.

425
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:05,836
I'm a little drunk and out of control.

426
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,955
Traive said we won't get paid

427
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:09,590
until every single one
of the cupcakes is gone.

428
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,158
- So we're stuck here.
- Fine.

429
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,960
I shall go circulate.

430
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,495
No. You cannot be trusted.

431
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:18,098
Next thing I know, you'll be
doing him behind the ice penis.

432
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,385
I'm telling you, I am done.

433
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,337
You told me that five minutes ago.

434
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,022
Well, you told me he was breaking up

435
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:26,507
with his girlfriend three times.

436
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,176
So I guess we learned tonight
that you know nothing about him,

437
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,811
and I know nothing about me.

438
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,279
Cheers!

439
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,648
Wait for me.

440
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,016
Hello, girls.

441
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,684
Traivor told me
you were looking to get paid.

442
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,520
But just to be clear,
you can't actually be paid

443
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:40,821
until all the cupcakes are gone.

444
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:42,156
And do me a favor, love,

445
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:43,791
put a chocolate aside for Johnny.

446
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,025
He loves chocolate.

447
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,627
He'll eat a vanilla if it's available,

448
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:48,879
but he always goes back to chocolate.

449
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,719
I don't think he's going
to break up with her.

450
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,871
Really?

451
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:03,394
You have the accuracy rate
of a magic 8 ball.

452
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:05,379
[Scoffs]

453
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:08,599
Look at her.
She's so pretty.

454
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,235
And bitchy.
And...

455
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:14,321
More pretty than bitchy.

456
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,890
Oh, God.
She just zipped his hoodie

457
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:19,660
and fixed his hair--
that's a couple.

458
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:20,945
What they have is real.

459
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:23,564
They are a couple--
Johnny and Cash.

460
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:27,334
Oh-ho, crap!
Johnny Cash!

461
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:30,904
They're an institution.

462
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,790
I never had a chance.

463
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,708
Forget the money--
let's just go.

464
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,909
Mm-mmm.

465
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:38,345
We are staying till
these cupcakes are gone.

466
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:41,215
I am not leaving
with no dignity and no money.

467
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,384
Fine, I'll circulate
a couple more times.

468
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:45,019
Wait a minute.

469
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,254
They said they had to be gone,

470
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:50,808
but they didn't say
who had to make them gone.

471
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,645
We eat them and go!

472
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,780
You're doing it!
I rescued you from the gutter.

473
00:17:56,782 --> 00:18:00,868
Uh, well, that's
not entirely accura--

474
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,895
Both: [Laughing]
Mm-hmm!

475

Both: [Laughing]
Mmm, mmm.

- [Riotous laugh]

477
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,396
Max, wake up.

478
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,481
It's 3:00.

479
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,649

482
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:38,739
with another woman
with...Frosting on my boobs,

483
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:41,492
would be this depressing.

484
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:43,644
How are you feeling
about it all today?

485
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:44,745
Do you want to talk?

486
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:48,415
- No.
- Good.

487
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:02,012
Where's your purse?

488
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:03,597
I'm going to take some
of the money we made last night

489
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,965
and get coffee.
And yes--

490
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,667
I am walking down the street
like this,

491
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,771
because after last night,
I am impenetrable to shame.

492
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,773
Wait, we don't have any money.

493
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,174
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

494
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:15,309
We did, but we don't.

495
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:18,028
I bought something with it.

496
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,531
I bought this.

497
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,734
You carried that home?
Where was I?

498
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:24,851
Three blocks ahead of me,

499
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:28,739
telling strangers about your pattern.

500
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,207
I saw you and Johnny
just hanging there,

501
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:32,042
and I knew what I had to do.

502
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:34,044
So what, am I supposed
to hang that up?

503
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:36,163
No. You're supposed
to destroy it.

504
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:39,366
You need to get over him,
so you're going to kick this,

505
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:41,168
and then you're going
to kick him once and for all.

506
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,586
You want to break your pattern?

507
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:44,371
Start by breaking the painting.

508
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:46,557
That is a complete waste of money.

509
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,759
I may have been wrong about
everything else about Johnny,

510
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:51,595
but I'm right about this.
Come on.

511
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:53,897
Kick it.

512
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,151
I can't.

513
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,852
- Give me your foot.
- What?

514
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,487
Lift up your leg.

515
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,609
Yay! You did it.

516
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,244
Good for you!

517
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:10,414
You broke a painting
and maybe your pattern.

518
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:13,367
I really liked him.

519
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:15,502
I know.

520
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:17,788
Well?

521
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,791
I slept through my day job,
so what the heck?

522
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:23,177
I think I will take to the bed
or whatever.

523
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:26,130
Just for like 20 minutes.

524
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,598
I'll set my alarm and then I'll get up

525
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,216
and get ready for work.

526
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:32,770
Max, please,
I feel like we need a hug.

527
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:35,522
We just slept together!
You women are so needy.
