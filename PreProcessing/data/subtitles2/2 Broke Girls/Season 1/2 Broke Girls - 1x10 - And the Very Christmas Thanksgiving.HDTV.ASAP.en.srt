Yeah, I had a version
of that, only it was more like,

162
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,936
point, and when
they look the other way,

163
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:25,438
stuff steaks
down your pants and run.

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,057
Come on, there has to be
a mixer here we can afford.

165
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,860
There is.

166
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,562
Here.

167
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:35,582
A $5 spoon?
That's what we can afford?

168
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:38,952
Yeah, if we put it on layaway,
work hard for a few years.

169
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:40,837
I'm used to being poor
around your stuff,

170
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,173
but not around stuff
that I want.

171
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,375
What happened to all your
"money's not important"

172
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:46,543
holiday spirit now?

173
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,211
Max, it feels like you want me

174
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,912
to be depressed
about the holidays.

175
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,098
No, no. I'm just saying
that it's okay for you

176
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,516
not to be all up
and everything around me

177
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:54,684
if you're not feeling it.

178
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,469
It's all right
to let your dark side out.

179
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:58,855
[Deep voice]
Come to the dark side.

180
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:00,607
Oh, my God.

181
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:02,425
Look, they're hiring elves.

182
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:03,760
Why would I go to the dark side

183
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,895
when I could go to Santaworld?

184
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:08,448
Let's go get in line.
I've always loved Santaworld.

185
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,600
Me too,
as a David Sedaris story,

186
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,068
not as an actual
real-life option.

187
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,320
Come on.

188
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:15,438
If we get hired, we could use
our employee discount

189
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,958
to get one of the really
good cake mixers.

190
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,076
[Gasps] And then it'd be like
it came from Santa!

191
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,945
Come on, Max,
we'd be great elves.

192
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:25,465
I have the holiday spirit.
You're great with kids.

193
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,417
And we're both
so desperate for money,

194
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,952
we'll wear
other people's tights.

195
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,138
Max, I've been coming
to this store at Christmastime

196
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,923
with my father
since I was little.

197
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,593
I'd get all dressed up in
my fanciest winter coat and hat

198
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:38,728
and then stand
in line to see Santa

199
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,097
with my hands in my muff.

200
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:50,106
And they didn't throw you out?

201
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:53,243
There is nothing Christmas-y
about this hallway.

202
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,445
It looks like the place
Santa sends promiscuous elves

203
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:58,365
to get the results
of their S.T.D. test.

204
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,500
Okay, that's
the kind of comment

205
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:02,452
that almost got us knocked
out of the first round.

206
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,371
You're lucky
I edited your application.

207
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,789
Why, what was so bad?

208
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,492
You requested to work
in Santa's sex toy shop.

209
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:10,877
Max, that's not even a thing.

210
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,097
Tell that to my
candy-cane-shaped vibrator.

211
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,883
Max!

212
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:21,003
I call it "Santa's big helper."

213
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:23,606
Please try and get
into the holiday spirit.

214
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:24,974
I know. If we get hired,

215
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:27,694
<i>we'll go right home and watch
Miracle on 34th Sstreet.</i>

216
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:29,813
It'll be a miracle
on 34th Street

217
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,014
if we make it out of the bottom
of this slave ship

218
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,234
without elf scurvy.

219
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:35,902
Hi.

220
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:39,289
<i>I couldn't help but overhear you
mention Miracle on 34th Street.</i>

221
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,458
That's my absolute favorite
Christmas movie.

222
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,709
Mine too!

- I'm Caroline.

227
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,389
Hi. I'm Mary.

228
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,641
It's cool.
We don't need to talk.

229
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,977
That's Max. She's kind of
a Grinch about Christmas.

230
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,929
Oh, like my brother Patrick--

231
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:05,432
He's always teasing me
about loving Christmas.

232
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:08,568
He calls me "Mary Christmas."
[Laughing]

- [Laughing]
- Get it?

234
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:13,156
It's 'cause my name is Mary.

I can't help it.

Disconnect
before it's too late.

Don't be so cynical.

240
00:09:23,785 --> 00:09:25,085
Especially Christmas eve.

241
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,403
It's an O'Brien
family tradition.

242

All seven of my sisters
and brothers--

we line up on the staircase
in our brand-new Christmas PJs

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,176
and have our picture taken.

where I am right now--

at Santaworld.

No, it's not depressing at all.

00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,363
The man's in prison, and he
thinks this is depressing.

Oh. Are you sure?

00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:59,786
It's really not that far.

Okay. If that's what you want.

Call me on Thanksgiving.
Love you.

He thought about it
and doesn't want me to come.

is now officially over.

277
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,446
According to my calculations,

278
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,749
we served over
300 turkey dinners

279
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,651
and only had two knife fights.

Thank you, Caroline.

281
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:11,122
This experience taught me
that rich or poor,

282
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:14,659
home or homeless,
we are all the same.

283
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,544
Wait. Where's my wallet?

284
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:19,330
They took my wallet,
those dirty sons of--

285

Oh, here it is.

Yes, we are all the same.

287
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:27,972
Well, I have two things to say.

288
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:30,391
First of all,
I'm incredibly proud of us

289
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:32,143
for spreading the spirit
of Thanksgiving together.

290
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,629
And secondly, someone left
an adult diaper in this booth,

291
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:38,816
and I am not dealing with that.

292
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,136
What's with the sad face?

293
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:43,637
You saw the bathroom?

294
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,140
It's just--even though
we fed the homeless,

295
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:47,975
it doesn't feel like
Thanksgiving without my father.

296
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:50,161
But you made a lot
of people happy here tonight,

297
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,696
and you should feel
pretty good about that.

298
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,448
- Yes, I do.
- Come on, elf.

299
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,616
We better clear these tables.

300
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,168
We have to be at Santaland
in an hour.

301
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,670
Why you have to be there
in the middle of the night?

302
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:02,006
Because it's Black Friday,
and the doors open at 5:00 A.M.

303
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:03,791
Yeah, we want to be there
right on time

304
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,427
to see the first person
trampled to death by UGGs.

305
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,845
We have to work

306
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,764
all night and then
all day tomorrow.

307
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:12,934
- How are we gonna do this?
- I got the answer right here.

308
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,002
Max, I'm not doing cocaine.

309
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:18,973
If we could afford cocaine,
we could afford a mixer.

310
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:23,010
Nine-hour energy shots,
aka elf juice.

311
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,695
I've never done these.
Do they work?

312
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,447
Millions of
wired-off-their-asses

313
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,199
college students
can't be wrong.

314
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,369
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,354
Did you just drink
that whole thing?

316
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:34,455
Yeah, why?

317
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:36,457
Nothing.

318
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:37,691
I'm sure it's not too much.

319
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:40,294
They suggest sipping it, but...

320
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,379
Who are they?

321
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,880
All right, we'd better go.

322
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:45,967
We got to go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

323
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:49,203
Oh, you should've sipped it.

324
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:50,554
How do I look?

325
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:53,958
Because I kind of feel like
I look like a North Pole dancer.

326
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,726
You actually look cute.
You look good in red...

327
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:57,044
And green--
red and green together.

328
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,879
You can pull off anything.
You're so beautiful.

329
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,399
- I don't tell you that enough.
- Whoa!

330
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,484
Whoa, slow down, speed racer.

331
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:04,885
I know. I can't stop talking.

332
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,237
What was in that stuff
you gave me?

333
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:09,323
I don't know.
The ingredients are in Spanish.

334
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:13,227
<i>Well, my corazon
is beating muy rapido.</i>

335
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,562
Okay, and why aren't you
in your elf costume yet?

336
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,281
Because I was talking
to those people over there,

337
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,166
and there's a chance--
a slight chance, but a chance--

338
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,918
I could get moved to the
strolling Christmas carolers.

339
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,837
I overheard their ethnic mix
is short a token blond.

340
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,456
And I'm blond, baby!
[Loud thud]

341
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:30,077
Forget it. You got me into
the underbelly of the elf beast,

342
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,262
and you are not bailing on me.

343
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,547
But those period costumes
are so much prettier.

344
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:34,632
I will knock you from here

345
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,550
to Rudolph's house
if you abandon me.

346
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:38,252
We are in this together.
Now go get your bells on.

347
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay, I didn't want
to tell you this

348
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:41,806
because it's, well, gross,
but the last elf

349
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:43,691
who had the tights they gave me,
well, let's just say

350
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:47,228
her little lady elf friend
visited unexpectedly.

351
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,865
Ew.
Talk about a period costume.

352
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,901
You're right. It's disgusting.

353
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,236
I can't do this anymore.

354
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:57,321
I'm leaving. I don't want
to do this anymore.

355
00:13:57,323 --> 00:14:00,041
I feel tired and wired
at the same time.

356
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:03,377
This was an awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful idea!

357
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,545
All right, calm down!

358
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,882
Jeez, you're like
a Christmas crack monkey.

359
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,051
Look, we are not going
anywhere, okay?

360
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,586
You got me all elfed up,
and now we need these jobs.

361
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:13,888
So just go talk to someone

362
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,639
and tell them why you need
a new pair of tights.

363
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,641
I can't. It's embarrassing.

364
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:20,895
Look, either you ask her,
or you rip out the crotch

365
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:24,065
and risk showing six-year-olds
your winter wonderland.

366
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,767
Now I'm sad.

367
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,302
You, the one
with the dark hair,

368
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:29,820
- I need you to come with me.
- Where?

369
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:32,023
And is there
a drug test involved?

370
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:35,142
Change of plans.
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus.

371
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,945
The other one had to leave--
blamed menopause.

372
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,663
Menopause, please.

373
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:42,533
I had my uterus yanked out
on my lunch hour,

374
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,753
and I was back
at my desk by 2:00.

375
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,155
Follow me...

376
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:51,092
Unless, uh, you don't want
that extra $2 an hour.

377
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:53,544
Oh, no. You are not leaving
me here alone

378
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,179
when I'm crashing on elf juice.

379
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,797
If I can't be
an old-timey singer,

380
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,049
you can't be Mrs. Claus.

381
00:14:58,051 --> 00:14:59,934
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm throwing you

382
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:02,002
under the sled, sister.

383
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,004
That extra $2 an hour
will bring us closer

384
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,356
to the really good mixer.

385
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:07,691
And the way my life is going,
this might be my only chance

386
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:10,010
to be married to a rich guy.

387
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:16,117
I'd double-check those tights
if I were you.

388
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:16,471
+

389
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,907
Ugh.

390
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,910
These tights suck.

391
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,546
Hi. Hi, elf.

392
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,548
I just got assigned to the front
of the line with you.

393
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,783
Oh, crap.

394
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:37,468
It's me, Mary.

395
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,889
"Mary Christmas."
You know, like...

396
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,207
- My brother Patrick always says.
- Yeah, you said that.

397
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,094
Look at how cute
we look...Jingles!

398
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,847
I just named you Jingles.
[Laughs]

399
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,815
Get it?
'Cause of all your bells.

400
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,267
Oh, listen...

401
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:56,187
Ah, this is my number-one
favorite Christmas song.

402
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,939
Ooh! What's your favorite
Christmas song?

403
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:02,059
<i>Silent night. Get it?
'Cause I want you to be silent.</i>

404
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,395
What's the matter with you?

405
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:08,065
You're acting like an elfhole.

406
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,235
Oh, hello, children!
[Children giggling]

407
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,338
Who's next to see
my husband, Santa?

408
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,290
I am so mad at you right now.

409
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,091
Oh-ho-ho!

410
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,960
Uh, hold on, children.

411
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:21,078
Mrs. Claus is just
having an issue

412
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,714
with one of her elf employees.

413
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,465
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

414
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,884
You abandon me on Christmas

415
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,770
the day after my father
abandons me on Thanksgiving?

416
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:29,854
You have balls.

417
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,106
Christmas balls...

418
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:34,225
Like on Santa's tree...

419
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,477
Or a Hanukkah bush.

420
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,730
Look, I've got
my own problems, okay?

421
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,932
Santa is kind of hands-y.

422
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,484
And you leave me here
with this one

423
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:44,986
when I'm coming down
the bad side

424
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:46,604
of nine-hour energy mountain?

425
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,206
I don't know what's
at the bottom, but so far,

426
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,408
not the miracle on 34th Street
I was hoping for.

427
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,627
- Well, elf--
- Her name is Jingles.

428
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,381
One more word, Mary, seriously.

429
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,601
Listen, Bipolar Express,

430
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,552
you need to jingle
all the way up that mountain,

431
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,722
because all these kids
are looking at us.

432
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,141
Hello!

433
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,928
- You got your list for Santa?
- Yep. Got it right here.

434
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,913
Well, he's waiting for you,
so go right ahead in.

435
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,816
- Yay, let's go!
- [Gasps] Hi.

436
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,235
Oh, you look so pretty
in your hat and your coat.

437
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,636
Thank you very much.

438
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,905
I used to have
a coat like that.

439
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:25,360
But she gave it to a reindeer
because he was very cold.

440
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:27,745
Oh, you have your list
for Santa?

441
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:28,830
Let's see what you want.

442
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:31,749
- Ooh, a pretty doll...
- Had it.

443
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,485
- An easy-bake oven...
- Had it.

444
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,454
- A Barbie dream house.
- Oh, had that, too.

445
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,490
Had all those things,
and now I have nothing--

446
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,159
- nothing to stick in my big hole.
- Okay.

447
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,546
- Jingles, what are you doing?
- Tell them, Max.

448
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,933
No, no. I'm not Max.
I'm Mrs. Claus--

449
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,587
Mrs. Beyonce Claus--

450
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,472
and I'm married to Santa.

451
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,891
No, tell them
what you told me--

452
00:17:56,893 --> 00:18:00,111
that it's all just stuff we buy
to stick in our big holes.

453
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,447
I've been married for 50 years.

454
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,515
I don't even think
about holes anymore.

455
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,685
Why is she talking
to children about holes?

456
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,520
- I'll get her.
- Okay.

457
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,023
- Caroline--
- No, Max, you were right.

458
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,324
They should know the truth.

459
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,244
Mrs. Claus, have a little,
uh, elf control.

460
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,663
Jingles, come into
my little house.

461
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,449
No, Max. They should know.

462
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,701
There is no
miracle on 34th Street,

463
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,503
and it's not such a
wonderful life.

464
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,088
If it were,
I wouldn't be standing here

465
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,557
in crotchless tights
in the middle of Santaland,

466
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,176
with a father in prison,
too broke to buy a mixer.

467
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,761
Stop it, you're gonna
ruin Christmas.

468
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,963
Christmas is all about money.

469
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:38,016
If you want stuff from Santa,
you got to buy it,

470
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:41,719
because there is no--

471
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,776
Merry Christmas!

472
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,747
Get her out of here now.

473
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:55,867
And you, put your
knees together!

474
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,072
I hope I didn't ruin Christmas

475
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,658
- for all those sweet children.
- No, you didn't.

476
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,511
All they saw was
a crotchless elf freaking out.

477
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,431
But "Mary Christmas"
will never recover.

478
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,634
They'll find her in her
studio apartment in two weeks

479
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:16,137
hung from the chimney
with care.

480
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:18,356
Well, this is all
kind of your fault.

481
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,108
You told me to come
to the dark side.

482
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,143
I just told you to get
in touch with your feelings.

483
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,729
I didn't think you'd turn
into Darth Caroline.

484
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,614
Once I went there,
I couldn't get back.

485
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:29,233
Yeah, and chugging
that elf juice didn't help.

486
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,434
It wasn't just the drink.

487
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,570
Before those presents
came crashing down on me,

488
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,571
reality did.

489
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,957
I have no money
and a father in prison

490
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,992
who didn't even want to see me
on Thanksgiving.

491
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:41,129
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
people way worse off than you.

492
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,446
Yes, your father's in prison,

493
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,433
but at least you have one
and you know where he is.

494
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,785
And you have a home and a job.

495
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:51,372
And you have a freaking horse.

496
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,392
So...

497
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,795
Happy holidays.
It is a wonderful life.

498
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,815
You're right. I am so lucky.

499
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:04,352
Well, since right now is the
closest to the Christmas spirit

500
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,770
we're probably gonna get,

501
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,439
Santa wanted me to give you
your Christmas present now.

502
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,242
It's our new mixer.

503
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,995
We're gonna old-school it.

504
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:17,365
Aw, you spooned me.

505
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,617
I feel bad.
I didn't get you anything.

506
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:22,587
Max, you got me everything.

507
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,489
Before you, I was living
on a subway, and now look...

508
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,708
I'm living near a subway.

509
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,260
So did you buy this?

510
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,379
No, it's from Santa.

511
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,882
Jingles, did you steal this?

512
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,751
Yeah.

513
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:39,020
I grabbed it
when they were throwing us out.

514
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,521
Wow, Caroline Channing.

515
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:42,673
You keep this up, and you won't
have to ask permission

516
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,892
to visit your father in prison.

517
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:47,228
But I did give $2
of our cupcake-fund money

518
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,013
to the Salvation Army Santa.

519
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,366
So God bless us, everyone!
It's a wonderful life!

520
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,653
It's times like this
I really miss Darth Caroline.
