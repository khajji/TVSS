1
00:00:00,528 --> 00:00:02,246
Max.
Do you have any gum?

2
00:00:02,248 --> 00:00:05,332
My breath tastes
like someone else's breath.

3
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:08,034
You're asking me
if I have any gum?

4
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:11,555
That's like asking New Jersey
if it has any sluts.

5
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,924
Great. There were onions
in my street meat.

6
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:16,393
Listen to me.
"Onions in my street meat."

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:19,379
Last year, I was taking meetings
on wall street.

8
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,650
This year, I'm eating meat
from the street by a wall.

9
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:28,221
Let's see.
Phone, chapstick.

10
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:31,391
A pill! Could be birth control,
could be ecstasy.

11
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:34,394
Waiting for a day off
to find out.

12
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:37,531
Why wait?

13
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,733
If I start touching your hair
in an hour,

14
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:43,287
don't let me have sex
with anyone.

15
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:46,406
Max!

16
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:47,758
Max, what's this?

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
It's addressed
to Max's homemade cupcakes.

18
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,094
Really? I thought
that was just a thing

19
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:53,580
I wrote
the new pizza place info on.

20
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:56,933
It's a $200 check
from that office party we did.

21
00:00:56,935 --> 00:01:00,020
Max's homemade cupcakes
in type!

22
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:02,422
No way, I've never been
typed out before!

23
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:05,559
I've been cash, I've sweaty 20s
pushed into my palm,

24
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:07,978
but I've never been typed!

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,929
We's all grown up!
We's legit!

26
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:14,234
Listen up, diner!
I just hit the big time.

27
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:16,453
No more serving up slop
to you lowlifes.

28
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:20,607
So everybody can suck it!
My waitress days are over.

29
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:21,958
Can I get some more coffee?

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,277
Sure.

31
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,663
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

33
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,559
Earl, what are you doing?

34
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,279
Employees are not allowed
to drink diner liquor.

35
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,230
Now, hold up, Han.
It's April 16th.

36
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,450
Do you know what day
tomorrow is?

37
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:51,004
Oh, of course.
Happy Martin Luther King day.

38
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,906
Enjoy a drink on me.

39
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:54,591
It's not
Martin Luther King day.

40
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:55,842
Black people are allowed

41
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:58,128
to be excited about
other days too, you know.

42
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,399
Is there a new Tyler Perry
movie coming out?

43
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,087
No, Kim Jong Il.

44
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,638
It's tax day.

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,925
And I always treat myself
to a Brandy when I do my taxes

46
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:15,028
because I need to be drunk
when I see that refund amount.

47
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:19,933
Chicken breast,
side of hot sauce.

48
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:22,536
Breast? Hot sauce?
Come on, it's right there.

49
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:25,489
Max, now that I have
big love for Sophie,

50
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:29,326
I no longer say inappropriate
sexual things to other women.

51
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:33,630
I save all my hot sauce
for her breasts.

52
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:37,084
Love has made you
a real old lady.

53
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:39,169
Here you go, Brandy man.
Enjoy.

54
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:40,637
Max, you got a stamp?

55
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,389
I wanna drop this off
in the mail on my way home.

56
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,507
I have one in my purse.
I'll just get it.

57
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,726
Max, he wants to file
this year.

58
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:47,144
He doesn't have time
for the search party

59
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,629
to go into your purse
and return.

60
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,798
Hey, it's a purse.
It's supposed to be messy.

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
No, it's supposed
to be a purse,

62
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:56,069
not a retirement home
for a pair of panties

63
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,272
stuck to old lifesavers.

64
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm kinda off my meal now.

65
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,829
I have a stamp
right here, Earl.

66
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,749
There, see?
Order versus chaos.

67
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,952
Also known as OCD versus

68
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:16,289
"Oh, here's a CD
I forgot I had."

69
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,209
Would you prefer a flower,
flag, or a love stamp?

70
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,628
Ladies, I don't care which,
I just wanna get these taxes

71
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,096
in the mail
before the deadline.

72
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,166
- Earl, you do your own taxes?
- I surely do.

73
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,019
Proud to say I haven't
missed a year since 1950

74
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:33,056
when I had my first job
as Frank Sinatra's ball boy.

75
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:35,675
Ball boy?
Was he a good tennis player?

76
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,727
No, darling,
he didn't play tennis.

77
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,015
The job was washing his balls.

78
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:45,619
And that was good work
for those times.

79
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:46,987
Do you mind
if I look over your 1040

80
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,855
to see if I can increase
your return?

81
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:52,525
Do you, Wharton, do you.

82
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,878
Well, at first glance,
I see you short-changed yourself

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,296
on some deductions.

84
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:57,798
There's 500 right there.

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Why don't you sign this now,
and I'll save you what I can

86
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,169
and then drop it in the mail
tomorrow?

87
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,670
Max, look at this.

88
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:06,756
Blonde ambition here
just saved me $500.

89
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,374
Really? That's pretty cool.

90
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:10,043
Oh! There's another 100.

91
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,762
- No way, that's awesome.
- Ding, ding, ding.

92
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,314
It's like I won the slots
without being surrounded

93
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:18,435
by those pissed off ladies
with emphysema.

94
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,054
How could you not know

95
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:22,489
there was a cupcake check
in your purse?

96
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:23,690
It just got mixed in.

97
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,492
And anyway, who still sends
important stuff

98
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:26,993
through the mail these days?

99
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:29,196
What are we, pioneers?

100
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:30,664
No, we're businesswomen,

101
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,499
and we need to keep track
of every penny.

102
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,035
Hey, should we frame it
and hang it on the wall?

103
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,920
That way when we're
two billionaire bitches

104
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:38,121
who hate each other's guts,

105
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,991
we can look at the check
and remember.

106
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:43,426
Max, I'll never hate your guts.

107
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:44,845
You don't know.

108
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,079
Business pressure,

109
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:47,848
you caught me sleeping
with your husband,

110
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,549
anger about your bad facelift.

111
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:52,269
Oh, honey, I will never
have a bad facelift.

112
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,754
I've been collecting names
of good doctors since I was 11,

113
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:57,023
and I was terrified
by my piano teacher

114
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:00,393
whose nose was suddenly here.

115
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:03,146
That's pretty cool of you
to do Earl's taxes for him.

116
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,364
I'm happy to.

117
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,449
After all, finance is my field
of expertise.

118
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:09,769
Yeah, pretty cool.
You know, all that stuff.

119
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,989
Helpful hints and whatnot.

120
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:14,541
Cripes! What more
do I have to do,

121
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:18,461
Rouge my boobs and stand in a
storefront window in Amsterdam?

122
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,213
Are you gonna help me
with my taxes or not?

123
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,799
Max, I don't know
if it's a good idea.

124
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,252
I've seen your purse.
I can only imagine your taxes.

125
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:28,505
Can you let go of the purse?
It's just a messy bag.

126
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:31,124
It's not like I lost your child
in the outback.

127
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:33,626
It's symptomatic.
Here, look at my purse.

128
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:35,512
You know what, never mind.

129
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:37,681
It's too late
for a purse smackdown.

130
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,683
But for the record,
even if you win now,

131
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:42,235
my purse will kick
your purse's ass.

132
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:46,773
Later, after it spent two weeks
learning your purse's schedule.

133
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:50,410
Organized, clean, perfect.
Look.

134
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:51,778
Just look at it.

135
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,413
Look at it, Max.
It won't bite.

136
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:56,800
Who are you,
my mother's third boyfriend?

137
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:00,486
And truthfully,
before I saw that check,

138
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:02,088
I wasn't even going to file.

139
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,423
But now that our business
is getting real,

140
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:06,159
maybe I should start getting
real about my finances.

141
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,428
I mean, when we are
two billionaire bitches,

142
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,213
I don't want the government
to swoop in

143
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,382
and Wesley snipe us
for back taxes.

144
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,935
Okay, great.
We'll do it tomorrow.

145
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:17,670
And I promise, no more
purse slams starting now.

146
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,140
Who is that?

147
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:24,778
CNN. They found a 34th Chilean
miner in your purse.

148
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,482
Okay, okay!
Starting <i>now.</i>

149
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:34,037
- Who is it?
- Kim Kardashian.

150
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:38,291
No.
I'm not Kim Kardashian.

151
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:41,828
No, I work for a living.

152
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:50,136
Hey, Sophie, you come down
for your cupcake nightcap?

153
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:51,838
Yeah, thank you, Max.

154
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,923
But tonight
I'm going to take two.

155
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,342
'Cause I'm getting
ready to date

156
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:58,845
and I wanna get back
to my fighting weight.

157
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:00,096
Sophie, what do you mean

158
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,848
you're getting ready
to date again?

159
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,100
Oh, well, there's
some really cute new guys

160
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,518
down at the Polish club.

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,854
And... oh, my gosh,
one in particular

162
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:12,742
is like a cross between
Vin Diesel and Viggo Mortensen.

163
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:14,778
Yeah, so rich and handsome

164
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,914
you almost don't notice
the wheelchair.

165
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,567
Hard to resist a man in
New York who's got his own ride.

166
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:23,403
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

167
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,755
Oh, then don't.

168
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:27,924
It's just what about
you and Oleg?

169
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:30,677
He thinks you two are a couple.

170
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,962
A couple?

171
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:36,082
No, this is crazy talk.

172
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,134
I mean, yes, we have had
some hot, dirty sex

173
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:40,603
in a few kitchens
and toilets, and...

174
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:43,423
On the floor of a sandwich
shop in the subway.

175
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:47,027
Plus twice we did it like dogs
on the hallway stairs

176
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,479
and on every smooth surface
in my apartment.

177
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,481
But I mean, come on.
I mean, that's it.

178
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,533
I'm a lady.

179
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:57,537
Sophie, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

180
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,706
but for Oleg,
it's not just about sex.

181
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,241
He feels things for you.

182
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,626
I know for a fact
he's buying you a special gift.

183
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:05,161
Tell her, Max.

184
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:06,880
Well, he mentioned
something about a fur,

185
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,581
and tonight
when he was talking about you

186
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,450
he did use the word "love."

187
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:13,169
Love?

188
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:16,923
Come on, don't ruin
my cupcake buzz.

189
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:19,342
I mean, this man has no future.

190
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:21,895
Of course, he does have
a giant penis.

191
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:24,464
But no future.

192
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,299
I mean, I've worked hard
to get where I am.

193
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,768
I need a man who has a dream
and a drive.

194
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,907
And I can buy a big giant
penis online for $47.

195
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,744
Really?
Add to cart.

196
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,145
Well, then you have to tell him

197
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:41,164
you're not interested
in going any further.

198
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,084
Oh, all right, don't worry.
I will.

199
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,952
Yeah, I mean,
I need this man in my life

200
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:47,837
like I need breast implants.

201
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,341
Which is like...
Not at all, right?

202
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,555
Here's another W-2,
H&R blonde.

203
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:00,390
Thank you.

204
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:02,576
Max, you worked
at a Mexican restaurant

205
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:03,944
in long island city?

206
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:06,997
Oh, my God,
don't be so judgmental.

207
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,499
<i>Mira,</i> look!

208
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,035
I just found a receipt for shoe
insoles and double-stick tape.

209
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:12,569
Work expense.

210
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,404
Again, senorita,
not a write-off.

211
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:16,907
Like when you asked if you could
claim your pot dealer

212
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,542
as an entertainment expense.

213
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:22,046
So I was wrong.
We've all got our talents.

214
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,413
You're great
at doing paperwork,

215
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:24,581
and I'm great at baking

216
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,351
and finding places to have sex
at carnivals.

217
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:29,019
Just add that to the pile
I'm calling

218
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:31,254
"evidence
for your future audit."

219
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,891
Not there,
that's Earl's tax return.

220
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,527
Can I see a copy
of what you filed last year?

221
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,529
Ugh... I didn't file
last year.

222
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:40,731
Or the year before
or any year ever.

223
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,317
Wait, you've never paid
your taxes?

224
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,419
No, I've never <i>filed</i> my taxes.

225
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,604
I've paid taxes.
I see it on my check.

226
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:51,241
$8 to the state,
15 in federal income,

227
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:54,828
6.23 to Fica,
whoever that lucky bitch is.

228
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,948
Max, why didn't you tell me
the severity of this last night?

229
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,001
Um, maybe you haven't noticed,
but I have issues around money.

230
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,470
Every year,
I say I'm going to file,

231
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,589
and then I put it off
and put it off

232
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,341
until the day it's due,
like today,

233
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,760
and then I sit down
with a 1040 and my W-2s,

234
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,145
and right around
the fourth question,

235
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,646
I'm like, screw it!

236
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:15,199
I'm gonna watch old <i>soul train</i>
clips on YouTube before work.

237
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:18,185
And then I feel like a loser
until tax day is over.

238
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,987
And then I'm like,
who cares? I'm awesome.

239
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,572
I'll do them next year.

240
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:23,991
So what you're telling me

241
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,643
is your finances are as messy
as your purse.

242
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,979
Careful now!

243
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,748
Starting to get a little hot
up in here.

244
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,333
Fine, I don't care.

245
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,151
I just want you
to get your taxes done.

246
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:36,170
Now throw away
all of your useless garbage

247
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,671
into this trash can.

248
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:40,824
You know what, I'm just gonna
go to that pop-up tax place

249
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,459
near the diner.

250
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:45,012
And I'll throw my "useless
garbage" in the dumpster

251
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,463
on the way out.

252
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:47,831
Wait, you're gonna spend
like $100

253
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,800
to have someone do your taxes

254
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:51,018
when I'm sitting right here.

255
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
The amount of money
I'll spend down there

256
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:54,688
is nothing compared
to the amount of money

257
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,307
I'd have to spend on weed
to survive doing taxes with you.

258
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:02,446
- Good afternoon, girls.
- Hello.

259
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,681
I hope Sophie and I's
wild lovemaking

260
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:07,401
didn't keep you up all night.

261
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,736
We wanted to come down

262
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:11,488
and show you the gift
I just gave Sophie.

263
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,742
Yeah, look, girls.
Look at my gift.

264
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:17,961
It's got a leg.

265
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:20,497
Wow, I didn't think you two
were the couple type.

266
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:21,999
We are going into Manhattan

267
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,700
for fruit cocktail
and champagne.

268
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:25,535
- Want to join?
- Hell, yeah!

269
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,838
No, Max,
you're doing your taxes.

270
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,556
Oh. My mother says
I can't come out.

271
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,643
Have fun.

272
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:36,730
This means nothing!

273
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:42,019
I can't believe you're putting
your financial future

274
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:44,021
into the hands of a hipster
tax place

275
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,023
called "The Tax of Life."

276
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,075
You know
how the old proverb goes.

277
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:49,777
"You take the good,
you take the bad.

278
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,747
You take what's left, and there
you have the tax of life."

279
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:58,085
43! Number 43.

280
00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,003
And remember,
if you need any help,

281
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,422
I'm acquainted
with your finances.

282
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,457
And I'm acquainted
with your attitude.

283
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:05,692
Don't say a word.

284
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,795
- I'm 43.
- 'Sup, 43?

285
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:10,714
I'm Kyle.
I'm your tax bro.

286
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:14,134
Hi, I'm Max and this is
my mute friend Caroline.

287
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,419
I already started
to fill out the 1040

288
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,088
and I have my W-2s
from this year.

289
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,422
Also some receipts.

290
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,392
Well, let's get started!

291
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,528
Do you have a health savings
account?

292
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,948
- Definitely not.
- Oh, well, we can fudge that.

293
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,452
- I'll put you down for 500.
- Sounds good.

294
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:33,287
Fudge that? Fudge?

295
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,122
I wasn't aware
there was fudging in finance.

296
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:37,991
Domestic production activities.

297
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:42,112
- Like condoms and stuff?
- I guess.

298
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:45,165
Talk about adjusted
gross income, am I right?

299
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,750
Am I right?

300
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,886
Kyle, put me down for 250.

301
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:50,220
250.

302
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:53,423
Should I just put the cheese
plate out for the IRS now?

303
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,926
What about residential
energy credits?

304
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,178
I bought some of those
curly light bulbs once.

305
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,231
Oh, that's another 150 easily.

306
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,633
Sorry, Max,
I can't stop myself.

307
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,569
Money, finances...
this is my thing.

308
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,437
If we were at a copper-plated
jewelry sale,

309
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,989
I'd let you take the wheel.

310
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,409
I can't sit back and watch you
risk our financial future.

311
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:15,145
You'll be dragging me into this
with you and your tax bro.

312
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:17,814
Excuse me, tax bro.

313
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:21,001
Oh, my God, you wanna claim
a residential energy credit?

314
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:24,288
You don't even have a 5695
up here.

315
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,491
Hey, your mute friend's
all over this.

316
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:30,177
You should let her
do your taxes.

317
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,012
She's way better.

318
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:34,298
No, that's cool, Kyle.
I'm not gonna do this.

319
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,299
One more year won't kill me.

320
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,267
I'll just
spend this money on pot.

321
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,654
That's an entertainment
expense, bee-tee-Dubbs.

322
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,725
Max, don't give up yet.
Let me help.

323
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,527
Look, it's already 9:00.
We ran out of time.

324
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,946
At least take a form
and file an extension.

325
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,948
The post office
is open till midnight.

326
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,183
Max, you know you wanna change
your finances.

327
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:54,284
It's a step.

328
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:56,186
You're right.
Good idea.

329
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,821
They have extension forms
at the post office.

330
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:01,524
We can pick one up
when I drop off Earl's return.

331
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,327
- What?
- It's not here.

332
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:04,461
It's not in my purse.

333
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,547
Last time I saw it,
it was on the coffee table

334
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,632
before you came in
with all your tax stuff.

335
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:09,967
It must still be there.

336
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,469
Uh, no, you made me throw
all that stuff out.

337
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:15,305
You threw out
a 75-year-old man's tax return?

338
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:17,007
You threw some papers out too.

339
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,475
This is so not like me.

340
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:22,012
The only thing I've ever lost
is my virginity.

341
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:23,597
What are we gonna do?

342
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,548
No, it's okay. Relax.
No big deal.

343
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,185
We just have to go home
and climb through the dumpster.

344
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:31,905
No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

345
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,556
Ready?

346
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:36,393
No, seriously,
what are we gonna do?

347
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:44,261
Well, let's get to it.

348
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,563
My garbage
ain't gonna find itself.

349
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:47,764
Max, I can't.

350
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:51,518
If I go in there,
I will literally be white trash.

351
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,721
Look, you're the one
who had to butt in

352
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:56,239
and get all "Wharton" with Earl.

353
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,607
If you had left him alone,

354
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:59,726
it would be at the post office
safe and sound.

355
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,077
Fine.

356
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,662
But to be clear,
if we find a baby in there,

357
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,498
you're raising it on your own.

358
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,750
Hey, it's already off
to a better start than I had.

359
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:09,336
There's food everywhere.

360
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,256
Oh, hell, no!
It's Tuesday... trash pick up!

361
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,591
Better get in and out

362
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,877
or we'll be on a garbage barge
to coney island.

363
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,211
Come on,
I'll give you ten fingers.

364
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:21,131
My shoes.
My dignity.

365
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,917
My shoes.

366
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,086
My hands are touching
a dumpster.

367
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,522
All right,
on the count of three,

368
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,023
I'll push,
you hoist yourself up.

369
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,725
But really pull yourself up,
or you won't make it.

370
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:34,361
It's hell.
I'm looking into hell.

371
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:37,814
1...2...3!

372
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,699
Whaa!

373
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:48,708
I wanted to scream,
but it wouldn't come out.

374
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,827
Okay, well, good luck.
See ya.

375
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,329
- Max!
- I'm kidding!

376
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,781
I'm coming around the back.
I found a place to get a leg up.

377
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:59,669
Now?
You just saw that now?

378
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:01,471
Aah!

379
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:03,506
Why'd you scream?
You knew it was me.

380
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,676
That's the one
I couldn't get out before.

381
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:09,679
Oh, God, look at this mess.

382
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,648
It's like looking for
a dirty needle in a haystack,

383
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,017
which I've done.

384
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,237
Okay, start poking around.
Look for familiar garbage.

385
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,139
"Familiar garbage"?

386
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:23,276
I hate it in here.
I wanna die.

387
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:24,578
It's not that bad.

388
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,913
My mom and I once spent
five hours in a dumpster

389
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:29,449
looking for proof that her
boyfriend was cheating on her,

390
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,202
and all we found was
a scratch-off worth a $1.50

391
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:33,703
and a beach towel.

392
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,505
And then, we used that $1.50

393
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:37,624
to take the towel
to the laundromat.

394
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:40,043
12 years later,
you and I use that very towel

395
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,546
to dry ourselves off
after a shower.

396
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:47,968
Well, I'm standing on
a stranger's cold sesame noodles

397
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,053
with egg shells
stuck to my ankles.

398
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:51,554
You win, Max.

399
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,506
What does that have to do
with me?

400
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:57,978
It means I'm officially
standing in your purse.

401
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,233
How about more real garbage,
less Caroline garbage?

402
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,452
Caroline garbage?

403
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:07,186
You have been dumping
on me all day.

404
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:08,788
Me? What have I done?

405
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,409
"Max, you didn't file...<i>ever?"</i>

406
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,461
I didn't say it like that.

407
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,130
And you didn't file ever.
Is that my fault?

408
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:19,532
Yes! This is all your fault.

409
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:22,218
Before I met you, I didn't
even think about a future.

410
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,472
Now I have a future,
and I'm standing in a dumpster!

411
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:29,175
You are not the only one
standing in a dumpster.

412
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,394
And... get a new purse.

413
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:33,179
If you had been able
to find a stupid stamp

414
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,547
in that horrid thing,

415
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,733
I would've never even seen
Earl's taxes

416
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,568
and I wouldn't be standing
in a dumpster.

417
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:52,231
Max, no, no, no!

418
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,400
I will never, ever
recover from that!

419
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:56,670
Red bulls? Red bulls?
Are those our red bulls?

420
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:57,754
Where?

421
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,739
Yes! Yes!
That's my garbage!

422
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,675
That's my garbage!
Get over here!

423
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:02,926
If we find it,
we'll have enough time

424
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:04,761
to shower and get to
the post office.

425
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:07,747
Earl's taxes!
Earl's taxes!

426
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:11,351
Next!

427
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,802
This is unbelievable.

428
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:15,271
Everyone trying to get their
taxes filed by midnight.

429
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:18,391
Wow, I haven't seen this much
last-minute licking

430
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:21,644
since the cops raided
that Thai massage parlor.

431
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,364
- I'll grab an extension form.
- You get in line.

432
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:26,232
The line's longer
than I expected.

433
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:30,070
No, we have to file.
She's nursing.

434
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:31,821
Don't worry.
We're fine.

435
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:33,790
I'm a bum.

436
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:37,276
She's got a baby hanging off her
nipple and her taxes are done.

437
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:39,746
Max, you can't compare
yourself to other people.

438
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,114
You'll do it your way.

439
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:44,417
And there's a blind guy.

440
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,170
No eyes, taxes done.

441
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,306
I guess he wasn't distracted
by YouTube clips.

442
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:51,925
Don't be so hard on yourself.

443
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,010
You're filing an extension,
and then you'll get them done.

444
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,312
You say I'm going to file,
but will I?

445
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:59,015
I say I'm going to clean out
my purse, but do I?

446
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:02,602
Sophie says she's gonna
tell Oleg, but did she?

447
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:04,487
An extension
is just another excuse

448
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:06,973
for me to put it off
and create a bigger mess.

449
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:09,993
Hey, Max.
What's up?

450
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,912
Bob.
Wow, what are you doing here?

451
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:15,832
Oh, I just filed my taxes
like everyone else.

452
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,784
Bob had a good year.
Ha.

453
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,420
Who was that?

454
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:23,206
My dealer.
Forget the extension.

455
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,759
If my pot dealer can file,
I can file.

456
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,160
We still have half an hour.

457
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:28,494
Run home and get my W-2s

458
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,963
while I stay in line
and fill out the 1040.

459
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:31,598
Maybe I should stay
and fill it out,

460
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,849
and you can run home.

461
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:34,017
No, I have to do this.

462
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,385
Don't worry, if I get stumped,

463
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,853
I'm surrounded
by procrastinators.

464
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:38,805
One of them will help...
Eventually.

465
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,306
Okay, here's a pen.

466
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:41,441
I'm gonna go drop off
Earl's return in the slot,

467
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:42,725
and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

468
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:43,893
Okay.

469
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:45,195
Uh, hi, can you hold my place

470
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,646
while I get a tax form
for this year?

471
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:49,032
Oh, cutting it close.
You're worse than me.

472
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:51,734
- Go, I got your back.
- And she's got your front.

473
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:57,190
So I add up all these lines
and put the total here?

474
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:58,658
- Right.
- What about student loans?

475
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,160
Yes, and I paid mine off
this year.

476
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:01,411
Then claim it.

477
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:02,962
That interest
is a huge write off.

478
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:04,964
Put down $436 on line 33.

479
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,134
- Post office is closing!
- No!

480
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:09,552
My friend just texted me.
She's almost here.

481
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:11,438
Please,
I have to file this year.

482
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,506
Midnight is midnight!

483
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:15,225
Boo!

484
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:17,844
Oh, please,
I have six children at home.

485
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:19,145
This is nothing.

486
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:21,514
Here! I'm here, I'm here!
What time is it?

487
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:24,717
30 seconds.

488
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,319
Make room, make room.

489
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:29,722
Stapler, stapler.

490
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:32,442
- 10...
- Sign it! Sign your 1040!

491
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:33,726
- 9...
- Where?

492
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:36,996
8...7...

493
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:38,781
6...
Fold! Fold, you bastard!

494
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,417
5...4...

495
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,569
3...

496
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:46,572
2...

497
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:47,624
No stamp.

498
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,876
- What?
- Aw!

499
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:54,631
It's cool.
I got ya, boo.

500
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,017
I did it!
I filed my taxes!

501
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,558
Everybody can suck it!

502
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:11,317
