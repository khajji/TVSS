1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:04,827
- Pick up.
Table ten, table 12, table 69.

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:07,329
- Oleg,
there is no table 69.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,667
- There could be.

4
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:12,168
- Oleg just sixty-nined me,

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,104
and now I don't remember
any of the table numbers.

6
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,839
- Look, he's never gonna
stop sixty-nining us.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,974
Forget the table numbers.

8
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:19,441
Here's how you remember
your orders.

9
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:20,743
You just
give people nicknames.

10
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,879
Look, I got thin cee lo,

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,716
fat rihanna,
jon beret ramsey,

12
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:29,152
and kristen bad wig.

13
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:30,519
- Oh, okay.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,921
I got seth rogaine,

15
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:33,389
child molester moustache,

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,192
and lesbian justin bieber.

17
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:38,728
- Good.
- Thanks.

18
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:41,330
- Pick up.
Table six.

19
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,133
...ty-nine.

20
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:51,607

+

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,392
- So can I get you
anything else?

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,762
Coffee? Dessert?
Morning-after pill?

24
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,532
Okay.

25
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:08,000
- Getting it on
in a restaurant.

26
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,170
I once made love
to a young angela lansbury

27
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,607
in a booth
just like that.

28
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:14,774
<i>Murder she wrote?</i>

29
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:18,612
more like
"harder she begged."

30
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,647
- Earl,
why isn't everyone you?

31
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,349
- Yo, what's up, mama?

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,450
- Oh, hey, johnny.

33
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,118
Usual?
Two coffees to go?

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,019
- Yeah, and can I get
two of your cupcakes?

35
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,988
- Which two?

36
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,490
- You know which two.

37
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,692
- The discounted day-olds?

38
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,561
- Yeah, girl.

39
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,529
- Hey, my bro and friend.

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,465
- Hey, what's up, big guy?

41
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,006
- Max, your boyfriend is here.

42
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,375
- He's not my boyfriend.

43
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,209
He's just another guy
who likes my cupcakes.

44
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,245
'cause who doesn't?

45
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,714
- Well, your face gets red
when you see him,

46
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:58,017
and you suddenly act
like nice person.

47
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,688
If that's not love,
I don't know what is.

48
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,456
- He doesn't know
what love is.

49
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,692
The only thing he ever loved
was a stepladder.

50
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:12,231
Johnny, here's your stale cake
and burnt coffee.

51
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,301
- Just how I like it.
What do I owe you?

52
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,302
- It's on me.

53
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,007
You wish it was on you.

54
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,009
- There's nothing going on.

55
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,444
He just comes in here
to get coffee

56
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,112
because he tags
billboards all night.

57
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:29,416
- Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

58
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,484
- Listen,
renaissance fair,

59
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,387
why don't you be a good wench
and clean up your counter?

60
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,026
- Until the cupcake
business takes off,

61
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,329
i'm just gonna have to find
a temp job online.

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,765
Can I close this window
that says "mexican painkillers"?

63
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,168
- Yeah, yeah, but, uh,
bookmark it first.

64
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,138
- Here we are.
Craigslist. Okay.

65
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,606
How does this job sound?

66
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,442
- Disgusting and depraved.

67
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,076
- You didn't even hear it yet.

68
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,879
- Did I not hear
"craigslist"?

69
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,215
- Oh. Here's something
easy I could do.

70
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,517
A professional organizer.

71
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,785
- You're not
a professional organizer.

72
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,354
You're barely
a professional waitress.

73
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,322
- I am a genius
at organizing things

74
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,724
and getting them
out of the way.

75
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,693
I recently lost all my money and
the promise of a bright future,

76
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,628
and I've organized that
into a file in my head

77
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,631
labeled "do not open
until you are stronger."

78
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,999
If I can handle that
for myself,

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,736
I can certainly handle
a stranger's light filing.

80
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,070
- If I had known
all that craziness

81
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,304
was going on in your head,

82
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,340
I would have ordered you
some mexican pain killers.

83
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,008
Or the peruvian.

84
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,410
They're stronger,

85
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:34,881
but sometimes they make you
lose control of your hands.

86
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,751
Thought that was an ibuprofen.

87
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,888
- What is johnny doing here
at 3:00 a. M.?

88
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,924
Thought it was
a rapist or something.

89
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:49,362
- Rapists don't
knock and wave.

90
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,865
And if they looked like that,
we wouldn't call them rapists.

91
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,768
We'd call them...
Johnny!

92
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,503
What are you doing here?

93
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,271
- I'm here to talk to you guys

94
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,940
about the church
of latter day saints.

95
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,643
And I have to pee.
Can I use your bathroom?

96
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:07,881
- No problem. Don't forget
to tip the bathroom attendant.

97
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,115
- What's up, caroline?

98
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,650
- Just trying
to find a day job

99
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,119
where I won't get
handcuffed to a radiator.

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,456
- On craigslist?

101
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,660
- This is so romantic.

102
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,429
Jumping over the back wall

103
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,731
to drop down and see you
in the middle of the night?

104
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,399
<i>It's very romeo and juliet.</i>

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,034
<i>- it is very romeo and juliet.</i>

106
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,571
He has to pee,
and I'm the nearest toilet.

107
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,673
- Please.
That's just an excuse.

108
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,909
The man defaces buildings.
And what?

109
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,310
He draws the line
at peeing on them?

110
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,912
He came by here to see you.

111
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,314
Pull your hair back.
It's kind of in your face.

112
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,784
- Pull yourself back.
You're kind of in my face.

113
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,719
Thanks, guys.

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,621
I was tagging
a building nearby,

115
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,722
and while I was on the roof

116
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:50,890
I saw that your light was on,

117
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,759
so I thought I'd stop in
and say hey.

118
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,226
- Hey.
- So, johnny,

119
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,729
you just saw our light on
from the roof nearby?

120
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,030
Interesting.

121
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,266
Do you always look down
when you're up that high?

122
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,267
- Not really.

123
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,135
- Interesting.

124
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,575
- Flying solo tonight.
My lookout guy went into rehab.

125
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,809
It's kind of a pain.

126
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,377
It's really
a two-person operation.

127
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,645
- Ugh, such a bummer
when people

128
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,682
can't handle their heroin.

129
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,918
- Hey, max, what are you doing
tomorrow night after work?

130
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,653
Any desire
to be my lookout guy?

131
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,022
- I might have some desire
to be your lookout guy,

132
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,358
but as far as the "guy" part
of "lookout guy" goes,

133
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,359
full disclosure-

134
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,627
- What,
you don't have a penis?

135
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,129
- Oh, I have one.

136
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,398
In a drawer in my bedroom.

137
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,905
If the cops come tomorrow,

138
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,840
I will run like a girl.

139
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,309
- Okay. So pick you up
at the diner at 2:00?

140
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,011
- Cool.
- Cool.

141
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,013
- Cool.

142
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,218
And then romeo left.

143
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,254
So romantic. All the weeks
of flirting and game playing

144
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,689
have finally led to this-

145
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,791
You two on a late-night
roof rendezvous.

146
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,560
- Hey, genius organizer,

147
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,095
why don't you put all that
garbage in a file labeled

148
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,265
"I've seen too many
katherine heigl movies"?

149
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,868
- I'm just saying,
he likes you.

150
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,572
He likes you
with his penis.

151
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,211
- There. 3f.

152
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,747
All right.
You're here.

153
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,781
Goodbye.
Go organize.

154
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,382
- No,
I said you have to wait

155
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,351
until I open the door
and check out if it's safe.

156
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,520
- It's my day off.
You're the one with the job.

157
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,288
- And you're the one
who freaked me out so much

158
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,024
about going into
a stranger's apartment.

159
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,625
- What did I say
that was so bad?

160
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,393
- You told me
he'd cut off my face

161
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,729
and wear it as a party hat.

162
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,799
- I said...
"probably."

163
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,201
Probably cut off your face.

164
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,403
Nothing bad
is gonna happen to you, okay?

165
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,072
- Okay.

166
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,874
It's a safe-enough
looking building, right?

167
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,075
- Yes.

168
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,177
Look, they have those
hallway trash chutes.

169
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,914
That's probably how he'll
get rid of your faceless body!

170
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,816
- You're right.
I'm fine. Go.

171
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:00,119
- Caroline's second job.
So proud.

172
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,055
Call me if you freak out
or anything.

173
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:04,791
- How am I gonna call you
without a face?

174
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,127
I'm fine.
I'm not gonna call you.

175
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,132
Hello, it's caroline,
the professional organizer.

176
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,674
Hello? Someone called
for an organizer?

177
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:27,080
Hello?

178
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,616
Oh, no.
Oh, hell no.

179
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,550
Max, come back!

180
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:34,920
+

181
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,953
- Hurry up.
This is so exciting!

182
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:40,054
- What are you talking about?

183
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,122
I'm not going back in there.

184
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:42,557
He's a hoarder.
A hoarder.

185
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:43,792
It's a bad reality show.

186
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,127
- Hey, that is a great
reality show.

187
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,129
<i>- but it's not good
reality reality.</i>

188
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,831
- The only thing
I love more than hoarders

189
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:53,902
are people who are too fat
to fit through doors.

190
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,904
Tell me the hoarder
has to grease his sides

191
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,105
to get through the door.

192
00:07:57,106 --> 00:08:01,676
You won't have to get me
a birthday present.

193
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:05,246
Are you kidding me?

194
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:09,017
They should charge
admission for this.

195
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:12,854
<i>It's hoarders 3d-
The experience.</i>

196
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,989
It's like going to an imax.

197
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,357
It's my max!

198
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:18,493
ooh!

199
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:21,630
Save yourself.
Go on without me.

200
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,631
Oh, god.

201
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,833
- What is that pile
over there?

202
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,701
- It's hard to tell
what is what.

203
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:29,103
It's either a-
An old shag carpet

204
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,640
or a mass grave
of dead muppets.

205
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,174
- No way.
Let's get out of here.

206
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,276
- We still have our faces.
Why would we leave?

207
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,779
And besides,
you need this money.

208
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,947
Look around.

209
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,449
There might be stuff here
they don't want

210
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,716
that we can sell on ebay.

211
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:44,152
Look. You know someone's
gonna want a fish tank

212
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:45,821
full of doll heads.

213
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:49,524
- Yeah, someone with a fish tank
full of doll bodies.

214
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:52,427
<i>Last year I owned a yacht
named the caroliner,</i>

215
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:55,029
and now I'm considering
selling doll heads on ebay.

216
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,332
I'll be organizing that thought
in a file in my head

217
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,801
labeled "don't open ever."

218
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,169
- Okay.

219
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,739
There's a heavy clown presence
in this room.

220
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,443
It's unsettling,
and I'm obsessed with it.

221
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:12,113
I want both more
and less of the clowns.

222
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,649
- Um, hello?
Anyone here?

223
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,452
- Oh, hey,
i'm over here.

224
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,253
- I'm sorry.
Where?

225
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:20,689
- By the papers.

226
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,390
- Which papers?

227
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,325
- The papers
near the papers.

228
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:28,864
- Oh, my god.
I love this!

229
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:32,734
- Um, hi. Caroline?
We spoke yesterday.

230
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,235
There's a lot more
to organize here

231
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:35,770
than you led me
to believe on the phone,

232
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,839
so we're gonna have
to renegotiate our price.

233
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,908
- It's not that bad.

234
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,543
- Not that bad?

235
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,512
I was hired to organized
some papers,

236
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,180
not clean up katrina.

237
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:47,682
- What's he look like?

238
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:50,685
Please tell me he needs
to be buried in a piano box.

239
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:52,888
- I don't know. I can't see
him through the truck.

240
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,891
- It's an rv,
and it's a collectible.

241
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:59,661
It's where
I keep my raisins.

242
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,463
So how much more,
then?

243
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:05,366
- Um, a hundred a day.
For both of us.

244
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:08,269
- And we get to keep the horse
head made out of soda cans.

245
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,604
- Why would we want that?

246
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,006
- We don't.
It's for chestnut.

247
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:13,374
Every horse wants a friend
made out of cans.

248
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,109
- You got a deal.

249
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,246
- Okay.
We'll get to work then.

250
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:20,849
Okay.
Let's not get overwhelmed.

251
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,951
We'll take it
one step at a time.

252
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,686
Let's start small.

253
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:38,733
Happy birthday to me.

254
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:49,578
- Whoo, max.
Well, look at you.

255
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,146
Starting the night
at the end of the night.

256
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,049
This is the first time
I've seen you

257
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,685
out of the prison uniform.

258
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,419
You look beautiful.

259
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,789
- Oh, earl,
let's get married.

260
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,194
What are you staring at?
It's just clothes.

261
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,196
- Max,
you look like a lady.

262
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,298
Tonight when I dream
of having sex with you,

263
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:15,336
as always, this time
I will ask you to stay.

264
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:17,939
- Max, you look perfect
for your date.

265
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,141
- It's not a date.
- It is.

266
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:22,243
- No, it's not.

267
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:25,780
It's booty call.

268
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:28,182
- There is a fresh,
white billboard.

269
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:29,383
I'm climbing it
with my friend,

270
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,652
and we're putting up
his artwork.

271
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:32,687
- Booty call on billboard.

272
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,522
If it's after 2:30,

273
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:37,291
call is for the dirty.

274
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,660
- What's that from?

275
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:42,864
Dr. Seuss' "oh, the places
you'll put it in"?

276
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:43,999
Okay, boys, break it up.

277
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Go about your business.
Nothing to see.

278
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:48,003
- Max.

279
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,205
Max and johnny's first date.
So proud.

280
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,573
- It's not a date.

281
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:55,744
- Be home at 11:00...
a.m.

282
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,547
- Uh, max,
you got protection?

283
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:01,016
- No, I've got it.

284
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:04,085
- Me too.

285
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:08,356
- Oh, sorry.
That is pack of gum.

286
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:18,767
- Can we take
these masks off now?

287
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:23,004
- Whoo. It is hot
up in that bunny.

288
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,338
- Are we wearing these

289
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,740
so no one'll be able
to pick us out of a lineup?

290
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,575
- Yeah, that.

291
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:30,411
And I always wanted
to see a rat with big boobs.

292
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:34,115
- Well, here he is.

293
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:38,653
- All right. Now for the most
crucial part of the art process,

294
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:40,021
beer break.

295
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,389
- That makes sense.

296
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,324
Been here four minutes.

297
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:46,795
- Hmm.

298
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:50,131
- Ooh. Gentleman.

299
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:53,434
- Look over there.
You can see manhattan.

300
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:54,869
- Oh, yeah.

301
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,238
She's a bitch.

302
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,174
Always shoving her stuff
in your face.

303
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,608
You can never have it.

304
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:01,743
- Yeah.

305
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,511
I'd never want
to live in manhattan.

306
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:08,049
- 'Cause you can't afford it?
- Yeah.

307
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,419
- She is beautiful, though.

308
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,454
- Yeah, she is.

309
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,627
Well,
we should get back to work.

310
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,529
Bunny's gotta hop.

311
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,220
+

312
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,708
- How many more times
do you need to hear it?

313
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:37,742
He didn't kiss me.

314
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:39,278
- Maybe it wasn't
the right time.

315
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,480
- Overlooking
the new york skyline,

316
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,515
a hundred feet in the air,
bathed in moonlight?

317
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:45,084
Yeah, that's a crappy time.

318
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,585
- Maybe he didn't want
to make a move

319
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,986
because he doesn't know
you like him.

320
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:50,655
- I leaned in.
I leaned for a kiss.

321
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,791
Maybe you had
a breath situation.

322
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,059
What did you eat?
What had you eaten?

323
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,660
- Nothing.

324
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,696
- Okay, but sometimes
when you don't eat, it's worse,

325
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,398
because you start
to grind up your feelings.

326
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,633
Then you get stomach breath.

327
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:04,436
I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling
with stomach breath.

328
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:07,406
- Yes, you would.
- Yes, I would.

329
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,309
I'm finally making progress
on the papers.

330
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,413
Oh, no,
fdr died of polio.

331
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:19,050
Oh, look.
They cured polio.

332
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:23,888
- Jackpot. This place
is a freakin' cat factory.

333
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:27,859
- And they're alive.
How refreshing.

334
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,596
- There's, like,
45 kittens in this box,

335
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:33,599
and I think one of these kittens
just had kittens.

336
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,668
Kittens having kittens.

337
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,470
- Hey, douglas,
we found some kittens.

338
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,839
- Those are not my kittens.

339
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,610
- Okay. What about this mountain
of butterfinger wrappers?

340
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,411
<i>- those are my wrappers.</i>

341
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:48,046
I need those.

342
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:51,483
- I haven't even seen him yet.
I love this show.

343
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:53,218
- Douglas,
if you're comfortable

344
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,887
with me selling all this
sort-of-valuable stuff on ebay,

345
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:58,890
why do you need to keep a box
full of butterfinger wrappers?

346
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:01,560
- I don't want
to think about it!

347
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,462
See, max?

348
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:05,830
This is what happens when you
don't deal with your feelings.

349
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,966
You start collecting
butterfinger wrappers,

350
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,901
and next thing you know you're
an old lady in a rest home,

351
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:11,836
and you're thinking
"why didn't he kiss me?"

352
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,973
- why didn't he kiss me?

353
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,176
- I don't know.

354
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,943
Why didn't you kiss him?

355
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:21,079
You obviously like him,
right?

356
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,515
Max, stop hoarding
your feelings.

357
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:25,184
Just admit
that you like him.

358
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,718
- I like him.

359
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,952
- Okay, good.

360
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,988
There's one box
of butterfinger wrappers gone.

361
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,691
- What?

362
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:35,527
- Douglas,
it's a metaphor.

363
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:38,363
So next time you see him,
why don't you just kiss him?

364
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:40,332
- I don't know
if I can kiss him first.

365
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,670
- Just kiss him already!

366
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:47,539
- Wait, there's another
person in here?

367
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,674
- Butt out, ma.

368
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,577
- Those are my kittens,
young lady.

369
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:54,379
- Hold up. He's hoarding
another hoarder in here?

370
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,216
Awesome.

371
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,088
I can't believe you put

372
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,290
the platypus foot rest
in the trash.

373
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,093
On ebay we could get at least
three to six dollars for it.

374
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,728
- I'm gonna tell you this
one more time.

375
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:13,164
It's a opossum, and it died
at least three to six years ago.

376
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,567
Oh, my god.
There's johnny.

377
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:18,570
- This is
a katherine heigl movie.

378
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:24,543
- What are you guys
doing in this neighborhood?

379
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:26,712
- Oh, hello.
Sorry to interrupt you,

380
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,480
but what the hell's
going on here?

381
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,582
- This is, uh...

382
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,183
- I'm cassandra,
his girlfriend.

383
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,553
Who are you?

384
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:44,129
- I'm max, and, um,
that's how I say hi to everyone.

385
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,898
I'm incredibly friendly.

386
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,135
- She's so friendly.

387
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:54,573
- Here's table ten, earl.

388
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:56,275
- Are you okay, max?

389
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,443
Rumor has it that you had
your heart broken.

390
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:00,111
- I didn't have
my heart broken.

391
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:03,348
- And that's why
I don't listen to rumors.

392
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,451
- Max, I want to announce
I have ended my bromance

393
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,186
with your boyfriend,
johnny.

394
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:11,189
I hate the player
as well as the game.

395
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,393
- Never was my boyfriend.

396
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:19,631
- I would like to offer myself
for rebound sex.

397
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,501
Or, if not, I can just
beat the crap out of him.

398
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:27,773
- Caroline, did you have
to tell everyone?

399
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:30,409
- I'm sorry, but I'm not
keeping that up in my head.

400
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,477
I'm not going butterfingers.

401
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:38,317
I can't believe
he has a girlfriend.

402
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,484
- Are you happy now?

403
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:40,885
You got me to admit
that I like him,

404
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:42,086
and then you got me
to kiss him.

405
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,855
And then I kissed
his beautiful girlfriend,

406
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,324
who is black and british,

407
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:48,627
the two cool things
I can never be.

408
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:50,696
- I'm sorry,
but he led you on.

409
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:51,896
- Oh, did he?

410
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,165
I think you and
douglas' mother led me on.

411
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:58,002
This is not my fault.

412
00:17:58,003 --> 00:17:59,904
He's the one
who's hoarding women.

413
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,143
- Hi.

414
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:09,080
- Yeah, you must be
to come back in here.

415
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:11,149
- Can we talk?

416
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,250
Pick up, max.

417
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,251
Table three, table nine.

418
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:16,120
Table 69.

419
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:18,490
Not a good time.

420
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:20,459
- Max, look...
- Johnny, stop.

421
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,860
You don't need
to "max, look" me.

422
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,995
It's cool.
You never led me on.

423
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,731
You never put
your hands on me.

424
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,299
You never even kissed me.

425
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,735
Food!

426
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:32,203
Hey, better make sure
he doesn't have a girlfriend

427
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:36,040
who's beautiful,
black, and british.

428
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,176
- Max, look,
I wanted to kiss you.

429
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:39,344
I want to kiss you.

430
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:40,912
I just didn't want to be
the guy who did it

431
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,614
when he's with someone else.

432
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:44,949
Look, max, I didn't know you
were gonna come into my life.

433
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,018
I didn't know I was gonna
have these feelings for you,

434
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,454
but all of a sudden it's "max"
all the time in my head.

435
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:53,258
Cassandra and I have
or-or had something,

436
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,761
and there is
or was love there,

437
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,897
and-and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

438
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:00,231
with all my feelings for you.

439
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:02,567
- Johnny,
I just spent two days

440
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:04,235
wading through
someone else's garbage,

441
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:07,038
and, quite frankly, I don't have
the time or the energy

442
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,207
to go through all
the clowns and candy wrappers

443
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,410
you've got going on
up in there.

444
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,244
And the next time
you invite someone

445
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,646
to a booty call
on a billboard...

446
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:16,147
- It wasn't a booty call.

447
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,449
- I think everyone knows

448
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,453
if it's after 2:30,
the call is for the dirty.

449
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:24,389
And p.s., we've known
each other six months,

450
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,625
and you never told me
you had a girlfriend.

451
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:30,729
You should have worn
the rat mask.

452
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,164
- And that's all she wrote.

453
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,841
- Silver lining time?

454
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:43,942
- We didn't have to change

455
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,010
douglas and
his mother's diapers?

456
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:48,179
- We made $240
for the cupcake business

457
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,281
selling all that crap on ebay.

458
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:54,319
- Yup. I made some money,
and all I lost was my mind.

459
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,254
- Want to hear something
you don't want to hear?

460
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:59,190
I think what johnny
said to you was beautiful.

461
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:02,293
- You think a squirrel
holding an acorn is beautiful.

462
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:03,528
- He didn't
touch you or kiss you

463
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,296
because he didn't want
to start a relationship

464
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:06,297
with you out of a lie.

465
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,866
- You know what?
You're right.

466
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,267
You've been right all along.

467
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,669
<i>It is like romeo and juliet.</i>

468
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,839
And now I'm gonna go home
and kill myself.

469
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,140
I don't think romance
is in the cards for me.

470
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,977
I give guys blue balls,
not broken hearts.

471
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:21,880
- Oh, my god.
Don't kill yourself yet, juliet.

472
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:25,350
I definitely think romance
is in your cards.

473
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,151
- That's not me.

474
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:29,287
- That's not his girlfriend.

475
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:32,190
Come on, will you at least
admit that that's you

476
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,825
and that he put it up there
because he wanted you to see it?

477
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:36,327
And that's actually
incredibly romantic.

478
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,497
- Oh, yeah.
That's the most romantic picture

479
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,998
of a guy who might
be kissing someone

480
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,332
who might look like me,

481
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,802
but he didn't because he has
a hot british girlfriend

482
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,003
who seems like
kind of a bitch,

483
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:47,205
but is kind of cooler
than I will ever be.

484
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:50,008
I dare you to organize
that thought.

485
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,410
- There's no one
cooler than you.

486
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,513
You're 200 feet tall.

487
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:57,582
- Yeah, and a bird
just took a crap on me.

488
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,684
- Come on.

489
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,023
Come on.

490
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:10,801
