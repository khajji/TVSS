317
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,405
Hi, thanks for coming in.

318
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,291
I like the uniforms.

319
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,410
You fill out
the front nicely,

320
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,513
and you with no boobs,
short-short skirts.

321
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,932
Smart girls.

322
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,301
Uh, we just wanted to
offer you a free dinner,

323
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:02,686
as our way of
apologizing.

324
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:04,104
So are you ready
to order?

325
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:06,557
What kind of question
is this?

326
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,061
Did you see
this horrible, horrible menu?

327
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,864
We can't have
nice conversation here.

328
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:17,267
Tomorrow I take you
to nice place, my treat.

329
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,986
Oh, you don't have
to do that.

330
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,872
No, no, I, too,
want to apologize.

331
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,957
You know, after you two left
the other night,

332
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,278
some of my girls said
that I was harsh on you.

333
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,248
Yes, all those girls
work for me.

334
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,000
Excuse me, I have to go
to the ladies' room right now

335
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:36,286
and look at my lips.

336

Thank you so much
for inviting us.

337
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,342
Are you enjoying
that beluga?

338
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:45,962
[Mouth full]
Mmm, so much. Thank you.

339
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:49,132
I haven't had caviar
in forever. Mmm.

340

Legs over your head much?

341
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:56,473
So, sourpuss,
you don't like caviar?

342
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,808
No, I'm more of
a cheeseburger kind of girl.

343
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,244
- Oh.
- This place is busy.

344
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:01,978
The waiters must
make a fortune.

345
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,781
Oh, yeah,
300, 350 a night.

346
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,583
What do you girls make?

347
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:09,002
60 to 80
on a good night.

348
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,421
And how do you expect you will
accomplish cupcake business

349
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:12,923
on money like this?

350
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,625
Well,
we're just starting out.

351
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:18,011
Yes, but at this rate,
it will take forever.

352
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:20,830
You know, I, too,
have big dream.

353
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:24,668
I am building summer house
by lake in Poland.

354
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,103
You want to see?

355
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,387
Oh, you have pictures?

356
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,557
No, I have house.

357
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,513
This is model
from the architect.

358
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:44,154
And I take it everywhere I am,
to remember where I'm going.

359
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,405
It's cool.

360
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,858
See, girls like you
should be making more money.

361
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,378
Maybe you could consider
coming to work for me.

362
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:54,998
- Sophie!
- Oh.

363
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,701
Thank you for sending girl
to my apartment yesterday.

364
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,970
Oh, did she do the job?

365
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,755
Oh, like no one
ever before.

366
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:05,542
Down on all fours,
under, over,

367
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:09,563
under again.
Oh! [Laughs]

368
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:12,349
Well, my girls don't leave
until you're satisfied.

369
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,551
Maybe she can come
two times a week.

370
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:18,855
She can come
whenever you want her to come.

371
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:20,524
Are these
two of your girls?

372
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,577
Well, we were just
discussing that.

373
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,581
Well, this one here looks like
she can take a lot.

374
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,250
Uh, thanks?

375
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:33,203
My friend Yanni
is at the bar.

376
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,739

in great need of your service.

Oh, yes.

Uh, excuse me, and, um,
don't touch my house.

379
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,550
I can't believe
she would actually consider

380
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,468
asking us
to be prostitutes.

381
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,720
I know.

382
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,521
I mean, me, I get,
but you, I don't see it.

383
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:55,308
You heard the guy, I look like
I could "take a lot."

Max, it's not funny.

387

Of course we're not
gonna do it, but come on,

388
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:05,068
you'd be
a terrible hooker.

389
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,405
Thank you,
I would be a terrible hooker.

390
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,940
I have a heart, and soul,
and dreams,

391
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,626
and want to fall in love
and have a family.

392
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:15,312
Oh, just say it,
you're bad in bed.

393
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,247
Let's get out of here.

394
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,299
I mean, really,
who does she think I am?

395
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:23,053
Someone who would just
sell myself to have nice things?

396
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:26,256
Let me just suck down a little
more of this, and we're off.

397
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:27,758
If we
walk out of here now,

398

we can just keep walking
to the homeless shelter.

399

be homeless than a hooker.

00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:45,275
We appreciate the offer,
but we are going to pass.

405

accomplish your dream?

406
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:50,664
Well, uh, I'm not exactly sure
those two things line up,

407
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,148
but thanks.

408
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,451
I thought you were
smart girls.

409
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,169
We are smart girls,

410
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:57,921
and smart girls
don't have to sell their bodies

411
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,322
to accomplish
their goals.

412
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,708
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

413
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,927
It works for you, but us?

414

Well, she's bad in bed
and I have a sour puss.

pay for that? [Laughs]

You realize
what this means?

423
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,333
- We insulted
a hard-working woman

424
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:45,702
who was trying to help us
attain our goal?

Yes.

listened to you.

Meeting neighbors
is a big mistake.

And meeting neighbors
and calling them a prostitute?

430

Bigger mistake.

431
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,850
Plus, we have to kick in
60 for the check.

432
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:02,068
What can we
possibly say to her?

That we're sorry, and please
keep playing the bee gees

as loud as she wants.

Not a good idea
to be smiling right now.

it's kind of a compliment

that we thought
you were stunning enough

to have sex with you.
