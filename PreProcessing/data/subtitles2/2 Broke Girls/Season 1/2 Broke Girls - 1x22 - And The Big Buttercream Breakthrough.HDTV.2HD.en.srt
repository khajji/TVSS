1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,870
How could ketchup get this hard?

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,220
You just hold it in your hand like this, and say

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,740
You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,380
Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,820
Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,640
No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
120 million dollars.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,850
Fine. If we win, I will get an eighth of my trust fund back.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,460
Come on. Now, who's got our ticket?

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,790
I've got the ticket. I put it here.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,790
I figured it's for everybody else gets lucky.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,690
By the way, if we win,

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,820
Also put a soda fridge in my garage for show.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,110
Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win?

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,690
Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can,

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,190
and set me up with some kind of  Hugh Hefner  situation.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,700
Here we go, for the big money.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,180
Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription.

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,380
We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,380
And the first number isÂ¡Â­6!

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,350
And the second number is 47.

23
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,430
Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

26
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,190
Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,400
So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,870
Oh, can't wait

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,850
Me and you handing out free cupcakes

30
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,720
stuck between hipsters selling crochet

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,690
iPad sleeves and salt peppers and salt pepper shakers.

32
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,420
We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,890
One person eats it and spreads it around their friends.

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,280
So we are herpes.

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,940
Hello, Sophie.

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,390
If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,100
Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limo over me.

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,730
Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here.

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,780
Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together.

40
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,840
Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes?

41
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,540
Won't you scutter your little butt over there

42
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,640
and get me the menu the way you are supposed to?

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Hey, Max, Caroline.

44
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,810
Come see me in my booth.

45
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,000
Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window?

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,180
What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines?

47
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,430
I grew up reading Cosmo.

48
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,100
I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones.

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
It's the nipples, the end.

50
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,400
I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,720
We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,230
We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair?

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,680
Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,580
And you can't spell "focus" without "us".

55
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,670
Or FU.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,200
Hello, Sophie.

57
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,200
Hello, Oleg.

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,750
So, do you miss the sex?

59
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,040
Oh, you know what? We should go.

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,650
No. We are having a conversation here.

61
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,110
And besides, the sex was not that good.

62
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,510
Oh, it was that good.

63
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,030
It wasn't that good.

64
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,030
Please, I beg you. Let us go.

65
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,030
You can go. I'm kind of into it.

66
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,050
Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey.

67
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,560
So why are you still standing there

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,170
giving me those sad, cow eyes

69
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,170
in that brown velure.

70
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,170
Because it's a good look on me.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,980
And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here

72
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,430
because you miss the sex.

73
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,990
I miss summers in Minsk.

74
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,590
I miss smoking in hospitals.

75
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,830
But I don't miss the sex.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,880
Fine, then. What would you like to eat?

77
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,670
I'll have my usual sausage.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,400
Ok, ding. It's ready.

79
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,380
Max's homemade cupcakes.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Max's delicious homemade cupcakes

81
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,270
- Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes. - Max.

82
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,060
come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair?

83
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,250
I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes.

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,500
Hi!

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,798
I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there

86
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:47,590
and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral.

87
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,800
Hey Dutch girl,

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,170
why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke.

89
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,140
I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized denim.

90
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,870
Max, please. We are all business woman here.

91
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,060
Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads.

92
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,390
Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out.

93
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,280
We've only been in business eight months.

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,390
Heidi, how long have we been funneling?

95
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,200
Everyday 24-7 for the past three months.

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,170
And we already have a booth.

97
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,620
Yeah we do.

98
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,940
I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel.

99
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,230
Actually we put the fun in the funnel.

100
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,700
See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun".

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,700
Or FU.

102
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,000
Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Max's homemade cupcakes.

104
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,830
Take this!

105
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,020
See? Success!

106
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,970
Scaring people into participating isn't success.

107
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,830
It's Scientology.

108
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,690
Calling Sophie we're taking that job.

109
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,830
You'd better have a good reason you're late,

110
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,700
because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.

111
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,380
I do.

112
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,090
So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet,

113
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,210
I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.

114
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,820
So after I thoroughly washed my hands,

115
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,650
I know they never really come off though, right?

116
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,080
Off your soul, I mean.

117
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,930
I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.

118
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,380
And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.

119
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,960
60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.

120
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,220
Buttercream?

121
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,110
This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.

122
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,770
I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy.

123
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,520
Why? Is your business partner on a show of Nicklodeon?

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,500
Look I don't do buttercream.

125
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,940
Buttercream is a bitch.

126
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,990
If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,790
Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us,

128
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,170
cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner.

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,980
That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach.

130
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,500
Oh, Peach is fine with it.

131
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,380
Why would Peach be fine with it?

132
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,350
Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five

133
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,840
but that didn't happen and I got thrown.

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,150
Peach is the connection I used to get us the party.

135
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,400
You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job?

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,295
I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us

137
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,880
and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance.

138
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,200
No way I'm not comfortable with this.

139
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,780
Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable.

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,853
It's the way you grow.

141
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:44,660
No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods.

142
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,090
♪Max
Max.

143
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,540
Max Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work

144
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,690
just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams.

145
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,070
You mean Americans?

146
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk.

147
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,770
No problem cause that's what waitresses do and

148
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,770
apparently that's all we'll ever be.

149
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,540
What?

150
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,190
I have to prove the sex was not that good.

151
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,130
Oleg on the food?

152
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,420
Don't say it like that,

153
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,020
That ham was already glaced before we go there.

154
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,450
So I am guessing you are back together?

155
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,180
Oh no no, the sex was not that good.

156
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,050
Oh, it was that good.

157
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,460
I went to get Mayo,

158
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,460
and it all happened so fast.

159
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,550
Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.

160
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,041
Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment,

161
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,190
but I would like it on the record:

162
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,370
I'm not a willing accomplice.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,610
So what is going on here?

164
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,530
Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake

165
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,280
and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.

166
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,830
This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?

167
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,860
Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?

168
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,480
It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,

169
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?

170
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,880
And original.

171
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,890
I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog,

172
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,480
we both have blogs and we both have babies.

173
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,590
Only her babies are adopted from Africa.

174
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,600
She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery.

175
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,860
About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her.

176
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,170
Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me.

177
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,810
Yea, here is the thing. Thank you,

178
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,620
but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor.

179
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,064
I'm not comfortable asking to do that.

180
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:28,546
But I did it for you.

181
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,261
And now you will do that for me.

182
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,510
And Max this has to go swimmingly

183
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,480
which is a new word I just learned.

184
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,430
So you are saying I can't get out of it?

185
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,140
I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it.

186
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,670
Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing?

187
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,410
Fine.

188
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,700
Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes,

189
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,990
ain't no drama going on in that box!

190
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,080
Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile?

191
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,350
What? Are you planning to never talk to me again?

192
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,810
You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking.

193
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,310
That's true, my brother is deaf,

194
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,770
not from birth, from firecrackers.

195
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,861
Relax, we still have time.

196
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,445
Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk.

197
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,450
The buttercreams are not gonna melt.

198
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,150
- Some people just like to create non-verbal drama. - En huh.

199
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,880
Attention passengers.

200
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,980
- There is an obstruction up on the track ahead. - No.

201
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,650
I bet someone jumped in front of the train.

202
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,968
Oh my God, what a tragedy,

203
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,030
the buttercream!

204
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,144
Attention passengers.

205
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,151
We apologize for this delay.

206
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:45,690
There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead.

207
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,970
It's totally like a body.

208
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,650
They can't get it off and what not.

209
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,460
We should be moving shortly.

210
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,240
What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago.

211
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,970
How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose.

212
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,970
Still? Still not talking?

213
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,300
Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither.

214
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,740
What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too.

215
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,570
And she just keeps talking.

216
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,710
I know, right?

217
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,260
We probably hit the body.

218
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,380
So it is all up in the wheeling and what not.

219
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,060
Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there,

220
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,230
I'm going to lose my babysitting job.

221
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,255
- Are we babysitters or bakers? - I was talking to him.

222
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:26,858
Stay out of this.

223
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:27,710
Nina,

224
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,336
if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes,

225
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:31,920
so we all don't starve.

226
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,765
No one is touching these cupcakes.

227
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,210
Our entire future is riding on these mothers.

228
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,260
I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell.

229
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,750
Miss, you are making things so much worse in here.

230
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,610
Are you telling me you don't smell that?

231
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,280
It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear.

232
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,290
This train is out of service.

233
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,620
We are approximately two blocks away from the next station.

234
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,160
We're gonna have to take you on foot.

235
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,240
Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety.

236
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,410
We are gonna walk?

237
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,990
They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels?

238
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,070
Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first.

239
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,630
My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees.

240
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,224
If I faint and fall down,

241
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:19,390
the others rats will like eat me and what not.

242
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,990
Rats? Max, are there rats?

243
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,540
It's a subway. The floor is made of rats,

244
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,940
but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles.

245
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,810
Thank you for responding.

246
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,870
Hold up.

247
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,930
I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this,

248
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,530
the rats would be the better option for you.

249
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,260
We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it.

250
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,080
How are your cupcakes?

251
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,870
They are still holding together.

252
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,150
Like us. We are still holding together.

253
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,070
Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk.

254
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,480
Folks, It's a bit of gap here.

255
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,200
A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap?

256
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,550
Because people need reasonably price basics.

257
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,420
I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.

258
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,306
Hey miss, you are next.

259
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,217
I put the line on, just grab it.

260
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,973
You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?

261
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,060
Hey, just take these.

262
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,250
Careful, sir, it's buttercream!

263
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,620
I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.

264
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,970
Thank you. Right. Thank you.

265
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,350
Ok, miss, you next.

266
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,350
Hand me over the cupcakes and jump.

267
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,762
I can't. I'm terrified.

268
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,975
What if I fall? The rats will eat me.

269
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,200
I can never come back from that.

270
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,811
Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No.

271
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,073
"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?"

272
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,072
"Well, it's a long story."

273
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,546
Girl, if you fall that third rail,

274
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:48,281
it will fry you way before the rats get there.

275
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:51,344
Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out.

276
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,560
If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth.

277
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,330
Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step.

278
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,160
Hold these.

279
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,300
Come on, I'm right here.

280
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,770
I took the step, now you have to take the step.

281
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,750
That's right. You did. I do.

282
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,827
Here we go.

283
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,671
Back up everybody. Yea!

284
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:15,016
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

285
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,299
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

286
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,283
Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh!

287
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:22,780
I saw a rat. We made eye contact.

288
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,620
You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off.

289
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,351
Sir, that is never going to happen.

290
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:30,621
We are in Manhattan.

291
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,770
I may be under it but I'm still in it.

292
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,252
And when they pull out my half-eaten body,

293
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:38,630
I will be wearing my heels.

294
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,102
Mariah?

295
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,636
Why? I only have one.

296
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:47,297
What are you gonna do?

297
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:50,304
Jump back over and do something and whatnot?

298
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,140
Constance, we're sorry, we are late.

299
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,730
I don't wait. I don't wait for anything.

300
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,080
I already have the iPhone 8.

301
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,770
Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway.

302
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,790
Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate

303
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,570
cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half

304
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,540
and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now!

305
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,190
Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look?

306
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,500
Like they all had unprotected sex with each other?

307
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,840
Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up.

308
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,630
- Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.  - There can't be.

309
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,820
Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing.

310
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
That is not attractive at all.

311
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,540
Is... is that what food looks like?

312
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,130
Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you.

313
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,940
There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up.

314
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,770
It's not a problem, we can fix it.

315
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,210
I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser.

316
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,900
And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch.

317
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,180
I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term.

318
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,240
You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these?

319
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,430
Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father.

320
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,150
Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream.

321
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,650
I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you.

322
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,710
But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either.

323
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,480
Right, Peach?

324
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,100
But I love Max.

325
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,470
She's been with me since I bought the twins.

326
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't live without her.

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
You are never coming to another one of my parties.

328
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,980
Max, you're fired.

329
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,610
It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful.

330
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,330
Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch".

331
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,510
And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted.

332
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,080
Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good?

333
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,120
You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it.

334
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,560
Ok, fine. The sex was that good,

335
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,560
as was the ham.

336
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,800
It was that good because it was more than just sex.

337
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,200
It was love.

338
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,890
Oh... it is not love.

339
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,930
Oh, it is love.

340
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,170
Oh... it is not love.

341
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,090
It was dirty, disgusting sex.

342
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,640
Yes, it was.

343
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,870
Oleg, do you really love Sophie?

344
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,220
Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her.

345
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,100
Her lips will be mine.

346
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,020
Wait, you never kissed her?

347
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,290
Not on the lips of her face.

348
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,230
But that day will come.

349
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,350
Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this,

350
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,440
but that is pretty freaking romantic.

351
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,020
I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black".

352
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,170
Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"?

353
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,830
You think her name is "Max African American"?

354
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,290
Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins?

355
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,300
They're in the car, don't worry,

356
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,020
I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe.

357
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,320
Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance.

358
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,370
Pretended? That felt pretty real.

359
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,900
Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them.

360
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,460
Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back.

361
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,050
That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow,

362
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,780
and then everyday.

363
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,110
Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow,

364
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,690
or any other day.

365
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,280
We have to focus on our business.

366
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,400
Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this?

367
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,140
No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right?

368
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,520
You gotta take a step.

369
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,370
Well, then how about just for another year?

370
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,960
By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves.

371
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,040
No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can.

372
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,340
Oh, Max,

373
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,620
I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English.

374
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,670
Bye, Max.

375
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,610
Wow, good for you, good for us.

376
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,740
Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place.

377
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,350
You have another job. You work for yourself.

378
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,070
You're your own boss.

379
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,080
My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion.

380
