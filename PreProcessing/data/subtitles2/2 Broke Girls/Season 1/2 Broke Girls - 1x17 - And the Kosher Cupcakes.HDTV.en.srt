162
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,839
How else do you think I landed

163
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,841
a handsome doctor like my Anshell?

164
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,142
- [Phone rings]
- Oh, doctor?

165
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,343
Doctor?
Doctor, if you could--

166
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,879
oh, oh, what is that
Hebrew word for wait?

167
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:21,682
You might wanna start
peppering in some English.

168
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:22,983
Now, Chava?

169
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,269
Now you're telling me
you're too sick to bake.

170
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:26,603
I need 80 cupcakes.

171
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,155
The bar mitzvah is tomorrow.

172
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,391
You're dead to me!
See you next week.

173
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:33,226
- We could help.
- We can?

174
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:34,995
Yeah, give me the card.

175
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,165
Hi, I'm Max and my friend and I
here have a cupcake business

176
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,917
and we'd be happy to
bake as many cupcakes

177
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,118
as you need for the bar mitzvah.

178
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,069
I mean, you need cake, we make cake.

179
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,538
It's bashert.

180
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,425
Look, enough with the "it's a
small Hebrew world after all."

181
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,793
How does 250 sound?

182
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,462
No way, 275.

183
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:52,880
I have to bake all morning.

184
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:56,249
It's like looking in a mirror.

185
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:57,401
They're kosher, right?

186
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:59,085
Are they kosher? Look at me.

187
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,021
Like looking in a mirror.

188
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,556
Good, I'll call you with the address.

189
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,775
Esther Rachael, if I could
talk to you husband

190
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,926
about getting some antibiotics--

191
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:08,149
sorry, sundown.

192
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:21,815
Okay, I've got the kosher
cookbook, salt, flour, sugar,

193
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:24,485
new mixing bowls, and I
stopped at the goodwill

194
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:25,653
and got us two appropriately

195
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,672
sad schmatas to wear for tomorrow.

196
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,656
Let's start.

197
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,842
Start?
I'm already half done.

198
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,992
How could you be half done?

199
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,427
You didn't have any kosher ingredients.

200
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,679
Oh, they'll never know, we'll just

201
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,713
tell them they're kosher.

202
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,499
Oh, my God, we can't do that.

203
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,768
Oh, my God, we just did.

204
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,720
They have to be kosher.

205
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,171
Do you want God to smite us?

206
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,306
What's he gonna do?

207
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,558
Take away all my good luck
and your fortune?

208
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,678
You think all those things
labeled low fat are low fat?

209
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,446
It is just a sales gimmick.

210
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,981
I had a low cal ice cream bar once

211
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:55,950
that popped my top Jean button.

212
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,319
Kosher isn't a sales gimmick.

213
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,204
It's thousands of years of tradition.

214
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,355
We have to respect that.

215
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,241
I don't respect anyone's tradition.

216
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,242
That's kind of my tradition.

217
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,877
Well maybe that's because

218
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,662
you didn't grow up around a family.

219
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,914
Hey, I grew up with a lot of families.

220
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,051
The Manson family, the Jackson
family, the Menendezes.

221
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,220
Wait, is that Menendezes or Menen-di?

222
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,756
Either way, they were like
brothers to me.

223
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,975
Max, we are doing these
straight up kosher.

224
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,343
Fine.

225
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,228
But return those new bowls,
I don't need them.

226
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,430
I can just dump the bacon bits
out of this old one.

227
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,317
Max, please, let's just
start the cupcakes over,

228
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,269
drop them off, get me some antibiotics,

229
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,553
come home, and put me to bed.

230
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,238
All right, I'll make them kosher.

231
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,489
[Knocks at door]

232
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,941
I mean, it's the least
you could do after you

233
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,560
lied to that woman and let her
think you were one of them.

234
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,195
Hey, I don't know who my father is.

235
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,413
I could be half Jewish.

236
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,665
Although it's more likely
I'm half bartender

237
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,668
who demanded my mom figure out
a way to pay her tab.

238
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,705
- Hey!
- Hello.

239
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,090
Serguisz and I are on
way up to my apartment.

240
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,542
He's making me brunch.

241
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:57,628
Cornish hens splashed
with my special sauce.

242
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,464
I love special sauce, I love that!

243
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,100
Yeah, and I stopped by
because I was hoping you girls

244
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,102
might have some spare
cupcakes for dessert.

245
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,721
Only about 40 of them.

246
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,422
Oh, good!

247
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,774
I'll go up and get started.

248
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,392
Sophie, can I have you keys?

249
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:14,762
- Oh, yeah.
- Cute place.

250
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,114
Ah, I have keychain just like this.

251
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,899
We are birds of a feather.

252
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,785
I love that!

253
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,219
See, girls.

254
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,438
This is what I like about
my new boyfriend.

255
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,123
He loves so many things.

256
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,541
And vagina ain't one of them.

257
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,876
Max!

258
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,961
We don't know that.

259
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,112
Sexuality is more fluid these days.

260
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:35,383
It's okay.
He's big, big gay.

261
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,969
So... You know he's gay?

262
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,970
Oh, know it?

263
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,471
I prefer it.

264
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,391
Yeah, my ex-husband
was large male bully.

265
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,144
Yeah, all rough sex
and stains in shorts.

266
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,565
Now all I want is a man who will
spoon me and stay soft.

267
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,768
But what about sex?

268
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,988
Oh, no one does me better than me.

269
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,662
That's the last of them.

270
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,663
Look at us.

271
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,331
I think we look very nice.

272
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,282
Really?

273
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:11,168
I think we look like the Olson twins.

274
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,420
Well hello, girls.

275
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,921
You look very lovely.

276
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,873
Mazel tov to the family.

277
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,875
What a mitzvah to be part of this day.

278
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,126
How bashert.

279
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,994
Oh, we're still on that ride?

280
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,179
I'm sorry.

281
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,798
It's just, I'm so happy to be

282
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,299
in your warm and wonderful home.

283
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,885
I was very close to my
neighbors, the Kleins.

284
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,638
In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

285
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,555
Stop now.

286
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,673
This is like when you tell Earl

287
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:36,394
you're practically black.

288
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,029
We'll just get our money and go.

289
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,313
Take our money and go?

290
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,648
What are we, barbarians?

291
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,284
Stay and celebrate a little.

292
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,019
But, out here in the kitchen,
away from the men.

293
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,822
Sit, eat, come.

294
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:51,859
Three of my favorite things to do.

295
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,695
Good looks and funny.
What a catch.

296
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,797
Hadassa, hand me a spoon.

297
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,835
All 100% kosher and so
gorgeous you could plotz.

298
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:03,254
This one's seen some
Streisand movies, yes?

299
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,140
Wait until you taste my kugel.

300
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,875
Oh, I love kugel.

301
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,645
Tell me, Esther Rachael, are you
ashkenzi or sephardic Jews?

302
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,931
Someone's been on the Internet.

303
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,485
No way, this is a pasta and a dessert?

304
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,553
Ooh, there he is.

305
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:21,372
My only son.
My little angel.

306
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,892
The bar mitzvah boy who,
today, becomes a man.

307
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:28,162
Girls, this is Shmuley and his
friend from next door, David.

308
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,382
Say hello to the girls who made
the cupcakes, boys.

309
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,234
Both: Nice to meet you.

310
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,453
Hadassa, Devorah, enough.

311
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,737
Thank you, go.

312
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,238
Enjoy the party.

313
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,223
Have more kugel.

314
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,125
I'll go ask my husband for your money.

315
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,927
See, this is what I love, Max.

316
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,462
The family, the tradition.

317
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,098
The lasagna with the crazy raisins.

318
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,799
And those two little boys,

319
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,384
could they have been more precious?

320
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:53,604
Yo, yo, yo, what up cupcake bitches?

321
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:58,642
I'm fixin' to marry me a beeyatch

322

That's right, you're not
taking anything.

485
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,786
Except for this compress.

486
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:16,238
Feel better.

487
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,123
Now go, get out of my sight.

488
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,730
And don't wear short skirts.

489
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,158
Esther Rachel,

490
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,544
I wanna talk to you about your son

491
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:23,746
Shmuley's behavior today.

492
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:24,930
What are you talking about?

493
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:25,981
What did my Shmuley do?

494
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:27,549
I'll tell you what he did.

495
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,218
He became a man.

496
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,336
That's all he did.

497
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:31,553
Right, Caroline?

498
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,005
I'll say he became a man.

499
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,306
What are you talking about?

500
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,290
Shmuley!

501
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,342
Stay out of it,

502
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,626
this is not our family.

503
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:38,977
You and I don't have a family.

504
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:39,961
They still do.

505
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:41,847
Let the police tell her about him.

506
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,899
So about my Shmuley.

507
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:45,150
What do you have to say?

508
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:50,322
Mazel tov, he's a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

509
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,157
Oh, there you are.

510
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,811
Shmuley, David, say goodbye to
the cupcake girls.

511
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,980
Both: Nice to meet you.

512
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:01,965
Thank you.

513
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,702
So I see no Max.

514
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,170
She still out sick?

515
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,288
It's her first night back.

516
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,456
She should be here any minute.

517
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,540
Did you wanna order something

518
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,758
or wait for your boyfriend?

519
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,930
Oh, see, this is sad story.

520
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:19,635
Uh, he broke off with me
to date other woman.

521
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:22,838
And she had penis.

522
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:32,498
Yeah, I can't compete with that.

523
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,532
Hi, Earl.

524
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:35,617
There she is, my long lost love.

525
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:36,652
How you feeling, Max?

526
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:38,987
I'm pretty good.

527
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,355
Hey, Bubby.

528
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:41,490
I brought you some chicken soup

529
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,242
for taking care of me
the last couple days.

530
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,327
I enjoyed being your Bubby.

531
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,963
I guess you were wrong, Max.
You and I do have family--

532
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,030
each other.

533
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,365
We're not family until we have

534
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:53,585
to testify against each other
in a manslaughter trial.

535
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,205
Here, eat this.

536
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,807
I don't want you to
catch what I just had.

537
00:20:58,809 --> 00:20:59,975
Not gonna happen, Max.

538
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:01,042
I took your advice.

539
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,043
I manned up.

540
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,645
I stared germs in the face.

541
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:06,432
That's right, when you got sick,
I got balls.

542
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,599
Booyah!

543
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:12,855
Like looking in a mirror.

544
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:15,171
