00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:07,589
Why the big smile, Han?

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,541
You going commando
under those corduroys?

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:13,044
No, Max, I am happy today
because diner clientele

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,223
has finally changed for the better.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,348
Look, two parties of cool hipsters

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,270
are sitting at tables near wall.

8
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:23,065
You think those are six hipsters?

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,273
Okay, let's go over
this one more time.

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,569
Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready?

11
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,193
- Ready.
- Hipsters wear?

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,196
Skinny jeans.

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,780
- Homeless wear?
- Dirty jeans.

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,618
- Hipsters listen to?
- Radiohead.

15
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,038
- Homeless listen to?
- The voices in their head.

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,791
- Hipsters have?
- Beard and a blog.

17
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:43,335
- Homeless have?
- Beard and so much sadness.

18
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,797
I see sadness, there and there.

19
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,466
I'll handle this.

20
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,866
I told you before,
I don't want you kind in here.

21
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,637
Take a trendy hike.

22
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:58,934
Better step it up.
The apple store closes at ten.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,936
Max, why did you
kick out the hipsters?

24
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,810
'Cause I could not
be in the background

25
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,013
of another Instagram photo.

27
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,854
Here's the last check, Earl.

28
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:21,832
And, Max, they stiffed us on the tip

29
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,307
but they forgot their camera.

30
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:24,725
Oh, I'll give it to Oleg.

31
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:27,829
He can take one of
his special pictures.

32
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:29,614
That way, when they
come back to get it,

33
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:31,800
everyone will have been stiffed.

34
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:34,068
Well, good night, ladies.

35
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,287
I gotta get home
before the snow starts.

36
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,772
It's not gonna snow, Earl,
it's 50 degrees.

37
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,691
Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me.

38
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,960
I couldn't tell
when my first wife was coming,

39
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:45,981
but I can sure tell
when a storm is coming.

40
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,252
All right, so what's the plan?

41
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:52,753
What are we gonna do if it does snow?

42
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:56,116
You're so white, I'm worried
we're gonna lose you.

43
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:57,625
I love the snow.

44
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,977
Opening my balcony doors
and watching it fall

45
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,763
like fresh white linen and
then running across the street

46
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,798
to the park to make snow angels.

47
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,635
Yeah, that's snow when you're rich.

48
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,470
The only snow angels
you'll see this year

49
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:13,274
are the six crack addicts
frozen to our stoop.

50
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:15,743
Oh, not to mention
the adorable frozen horse

51
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,695
we have illegally
living in the backyard.

52
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,030
Max, don't overreact.

53
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:19,997
Chestnut's fine.

54
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,115
It's not gonna snow for weeks.

55
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:22,283
All right, have it your way.

56
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:23,817
But I wouldn't want
to be the next tenants

57
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,486
who have to figure out
why a pissed off horse

58
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:28,489
is haunting a Brooklyn apartment.

59
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,660
I was cold and she thought
she knew weather patterns.

60
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,797
Oleg, take a picture of your
junk on this customer's camera.

61
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,159
Done.

62
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,452
Aren't you gonna ask why?

63
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,553
No need.

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,692
[Screams]

65
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,110
I just saw Oleg's...

66
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,979
Yeah, that might have been my fault.

67
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:55,950
Kind of a shock seeing it
for the first time.

68
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,902
Max, I don't like you implying

69
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,020
that I would ever
be cruel to Chestnut.

70
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,155
I'm not implying it.

71
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:03,824
I'm saying it outright.

72
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:04,976
It's winter.

73
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,877
And it's not like
I've not been thinking about it.

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,579
But Chestnut belongs
in a special home.

75
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,249
You belong in a special home.

76
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:12,917
I've done some research,

77
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,719
and I found a retreat
in the Grand Tetons

78
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,754
where newly-divorced women
come to hug horses

79
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:19,039
to help them gain back
their ability to trust.

80
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:24,145
The only Grand Tetons
Chestnut trusts are mine.

81
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,731
Lady, you gotta get
a reality check real quick

82
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,149
'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow.

83
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,651
<i>Earl also thinks the theme from shaft</i>

84
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:34,355
was stolen from a cassette tape
he sent out in 1975.

85
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,108
Shut your mouth.
That happened.

86
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,577
Max, it's not gonna snow.

87
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,778
I know snow.

88
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,863
We owned a ski chalet
in Saas-Fee Switzerland

89
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:44,749
and I think I know more than
anyone in this restaurant

90
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:46,951
about living in cold climes.

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,907
Snow is coming.

92
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:57,011
Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have
a conversation about cold climes

93
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:58,429
with Snowleg over there?

94
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,132
Oh, Max, I almost forgot.

95
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:03,100
The camera.

96
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:05,919
I think you'll be very pleased.

97
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,939
I made a little video as well.

98
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,258
Why are you wearing two coats?

99
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,060
Same reason I wear two condoms.

100
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,262
In case one breaks.

101
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,987
What the?

102
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,709
Well, good morning,
world's worst weather girl.

103
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:33,447
I have never seen so much sunshine.

104
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,715
You know what that means?

105
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,634
<i>Earl wrote shaft.</i>

106
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,696
Max, I know it snowed,
you don't have to tell me.

107
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,139
I'm surrounded by so much white
stuff I'm like Al Pacino

108
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:45,226
<i>in the last scene of Scarface.</i>

109
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,560
What are you wearing?

110
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,680
You look like a bag of
crazy garbage grew arms.

111
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,767
It's the hefty 2011
winter collection.

112
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:53,818
I gave Chestnut my coat.

113
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,937
This is the only way
to keep the snow off me.

114
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,106
Look at poor Chestnut.

115
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:00,574
What is he wearing on his hooves?

116
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:02,526
I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings.

117
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:03,977
I grabbed them when we
raided the town house.

118
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,979
I thought ahead for me,
but not for him.

119
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,033
He is humiliated in
those ladies clothes.

120
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,118
He looks like j. Edgar hoover.

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,204
I've been out here
sweeping since 4:00 A.M.

122
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:15,456
But it just keeps coming down.

123
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,957
What is your problem, snow?

124
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,794
I used to love you!

125
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:21,879
Maybe we should ask your old doorman

126
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,165
"insert generic
Irish name here" to come help.

127
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,467
I know their names.

128
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:29,186
Day James, night James
and black James.

129
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,223
So your plan is you're gonna
sweep the snow away till spring

130
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:33,891
while the horse
is trapped under this tarp?

131
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,060
Which I'm pretty sure was
covering the out of business

132
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,678
Cuban restaurant down the street.

133
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,064
They were out of business
and I left a note.

134
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,650
What did it say?
"I'm loco, gracias."

135
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,953
No, it said, "sorry I took
your roof, hang in there.:

136
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:49,573
Max, don't be so negative.

137
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,126
Doesn't matter where
it came from, it's working.

138
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:55,579
I just need to secure
this tarp a little.

139
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:56,831
Stop, you were gonna climb on

140
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,467
an icy chair in six inch heels
and break your neck

141
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,051
and then I'm gonna be stuck
with a horse in leggings

142
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,170
and you in a wheelchair
with a chopstick in your mouth

143
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:06,366
tapping out, "I'm sorry,
I thought that would work."

144
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,208
I learned to build when I volunteered

145
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,094
with habitat for humanity.

146
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:14,148
Looking back, they had
so much more than I have now.

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,434
Okay.
[Grunts]

148

you and I are gonna sit down

What I'm doing is
actually kind of brilliant.

those houses you built.

Hey, Peach.

a loophole in your prenup?

I just got an email

162
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,357

way over and I want everything

168
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:12,456
to be perfect when they see
Brad and Angelina.

169
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,775
Uh, Peach, are you aware
that your children

170
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:18,829
are being eaten by clothing?

171
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,465
The snowsuits are Burberry.

172
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,634
And the padding hides
Angelina's weight problem.

173
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:25,636
Okay, you have to stop saying that.

174
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,221
She doesn't have a weight problem.

175
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,174
She's gained 25 pounds in one year.

176
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:36,647
Yeah, 'cause she started at zero.

177

Max, we all have
to look our best, 'cause ready?

178
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:43,437
The last spot in the show is
between me and Misty Mastbaum.

179
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,022
I thought she was your bestie.

180
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,276
She is, but my bestie's a bitchy.

181
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:50,911
She's crazy competitive.

182
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,531
As soon as we were
approached about the show,

183
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:57,001
she adopted a three-legged corgi
and named it Mr. Pickle.

184
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,820
That's crazy bitchy.

185
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,706
So now, I'm looking up
handicapped animals

186

187

I was thinking

191
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:20,125

Anyway, she has this cute,
but crazy damaged horse

200
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:43,330

00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,747
Well, here he is.

321
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:24,982
And as we discussed,
Chestnut is a champion jumper

322
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,817
his dressage is impeccable,

323
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,808
he's ribboned three times
at the Hampton Classic,

324
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,122
and he comes from
a historically elite line

325
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,645
of distinguished show horses.

326
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,159
And he pees like
a civil rights fire hose.

327
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,128
Max, step further back.

328
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,496
Come on, let's cut to the chase.

329
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:42,267
He's nice, brown,
he looks sick in leggings,

330
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,686
and he's free,
so take him or leave him.

331
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,521
When'd you say he was a jumper?

332
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,839
From 2005 to 2010.

333
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,508
He was in a class by himself.

334
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,443
Well, maybe he was a jumper,

335
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,195
but he isn't anymore.

336
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:55,168
What?

337
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,586
Well, he's a little out of shape.

338
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,783
Well, you have a gut.

339
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,402
Whoa! I'm just saying
he's seen better days.

340
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,571
I'm just saying your hair
is falling out in fistfuls.

341
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,523
- Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

342
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,625
Let's not get personal,
we all want this to work.

343
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:08,681
He's the one who's getting personal

344
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,308
going after Chestnut like that.

345
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,913
Okay, you tell me,

346
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:13,561
when's the last time he's exercised?

347
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,383
When's the last time you exercised?

348
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,336
Wow, show business is rough.

349
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,004
All right, it's Tony, right?

350
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,472
Last time I checked.

351
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,391
All right, Tony,
you'll have to forgive her.

352
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:25,977
She really loves him
and wants this to work out.

353
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,846
Bottom line is,
even a free horse isn't free.

354
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:31,048
I still have to feed him
and take care of him

355
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,218
and truth be told, this horse
isn't gonna make me a penny.

356
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,221
If my film guy comes in here,
he's gonna pick that beauty

357
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,190
over this one.

358

Oh.

359

So it's not gonna work out, girls.

360
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,948
All right, well, we got
other offers, fatty.

361
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,167
Come on, let's go.

362
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:53,421
You know, maybe next time
before you let someone

Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian,

cologne-soaked rent-a-fur,

365
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,295
you should be clear
that the film business,

366
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:03,715
even for horses,
is ageist and elitist.

367
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:05,767
And, yes, we may have
seen better days,

368
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,386
but with hard work,
determination and a little luck,

369
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:10,087
one day we'll be back on top.

370

Yeah, and I'm not impressed by
your big star pony over there.

371

He's just standing still.

372

You wanna impress me?

373
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:20,949
Have him meow and ring the doorbell.

374

Don't take it personally, Chestnut.

375

I should look like one.

Besides, she'll probably
think it's a look.

All right, I know this one on one

382
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,520
with Peach isn't your ideal scenario,

383
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:45,854
but it's what's best for Chestnut

384
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:47,613
so man up and face reality.

but are you ready to face reality TV?

go, you don't have to do this.

00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,912
Are you crying?

481
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,632
Yeah, I'm crying,

482
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,951
'cause I wish I could live here.

483
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:16,091
Don't worry, we'll come visit,

484
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:19,061
and we'll find a way
to bring him home in the spring.

485
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:21,480
Come on.
I have a pocket full of dimes.

486
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:24,099
Let's go get
some convenience store taquitos

487
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,485
and wash 'em down with
blue raspberry wine coolers.

488
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:27,986
They're on sale at the bodega.

489
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,354
Two four packs for five dollars.

490
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,245
You know exactly what to say
to cheer a broke sista up.

491
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:37,663
And when we get home, I found a video

492
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:40,315
of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.
