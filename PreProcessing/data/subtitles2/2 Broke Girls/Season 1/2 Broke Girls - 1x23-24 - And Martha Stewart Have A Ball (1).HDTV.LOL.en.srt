00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,607
Wow! Bummer, dude.

3
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,242
You have a time machine?

4
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:14,212
And somehow, it got programmed
to this crap diner?

5
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:17,282
I must admit, I am
quite taken with steampunk.

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,250
Oh, steampunk, right.
I remember that trend.

7
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,818
It happened for,
like, ten seconds

8
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:24,788
back in 2000
and-are-you-kidding-me?

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,490
Dude, seriously,
you're sitting

10
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,292
in a public place
tap-tap-tapping

11
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:29,660
on an oldie typewriter?

12
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,295
What are you?

13
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,664
In the league of extraordinarily
pretentious gentlemen?

14
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,799
Aren't you being
a little aggressive?

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,400
Yup.

16
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,401
That's how people are
here in the present

17
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:39,902
where we live.

18
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,304
But don't get me wrong.

19
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:42,905
I'd like to go
back in time, too.

20
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,675
Maybe stop 9/11 or that creep
who had sex on my shoe,

21
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,142
but I can't.

22
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:50,279
Present?
Where's that uniform from?

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,847
Like, 1998?

24
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,648
Oh, stop,
or I'm going to have

25
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,317
to shoot you
with a Smith & Wesson

26
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm currently packing
in my bloomers.

attention, everyone.

00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:20,047
Max and I have a little
late-night treat for you.

31
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,882
Don't say it
all excited like that.

32
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,685
Now when it's not drugs,
Earl's going to be pissed.

33
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:28,054
You are invited
to a very important taste-test

34
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,221
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

35
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,090
Okay,
but I will have only one.

36
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,259
When I get a tummy,
single ladies call me Buddha

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,395
and rub me for luck.

38
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,065
I gotta watch out, too.

39
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,333
Last time I had Max's
chocolate espresso cupcake

40
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,433
before going home,

41
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,169
I was awake
till 5:00 A.M.,

42
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,372
hand washing all my thongs.

43
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,708
Thongs?
Earl, you devil.

44
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,877
That's right, just because
there's snow on the roof

45
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,445
doesn't mean there's
not swing in the sling.

46
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:57,515
Oh, Caroline, darling.
Can you go back over there?

47
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,283
I forgot my racing form.

48
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:02,920
Oh, horse racing?
It reminds me of Chestnut.

49
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:05,956
Max... Chestnut.

50
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,558
What's with the sad face?

51
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,260
Your horse is living it up
at a fancy stable nearby.

52
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,297
Not gone to the great stud farm
in the sky.

53
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:16,399
Did someone say
"stud farm"?

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,105
My fee is $10 a quart or $15
if you want a boy.

55
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,608
Wow.

00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,277
You bounced back from your
Sophie breakup pretty quick.

57
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:29,745
It was not
a real breakup.

58
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:31,880
I will have her
very soon again.

59
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,083
Right now, I lay low
and wait in bushes

60
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:37,119
like determined jungle cat.

61
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:41,056
Or a rapist.

62
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:43,658
Racing forms,
here you go.

63
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,127
Earl,
maybe some time

64
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,627
you will take me out
to the track with you.

65
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,896
I used to ride horses
all the time in Korea.

66
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:50,464
The mechanical ones
for a quarter

67
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,333
in front of
supermarkets?

68
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,769
Actually, Max,
I'm a very good rider.

69
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,971
In fact, I was training
to be a jockey

70
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:59,406
but was too short.

71
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,743
Too short
to be a jockey?

72
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:05,445
That's a hard hit,
my man.

73
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:08,048
Han, I had no idea
you loved horses, too.

74
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,816
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

75
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:12,085
Well, why didn't you ever ask
about any of my interests?

76
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:13,754
I'll tell you why.

77
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,655
Because all you ever talk about
is "our cupcake business,"

78
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,023
our cupcake business."

79
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,358
Doesn't your cd
have other tracks?

80
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,926
Anyway,
our cupcake business

81
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,828
has a very important
meeting tomorrow

82
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,030
with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

83
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,498
I know
a party planner, too.

84
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,834
He sells J .Lo.
and Salma Hayek Pinatas

85
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,170
off back of truck
for Cinco de Mayo.

86
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:33,972
Awesome.
Put me down for a Hayek.

87
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:36,507
More storage space
for candy.

88
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,377
Well, our party planner
is <i>the</i> it guy in Manhattan.

89
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:40,678
And tomorrow,
Max and I are doing

90
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,180
a tasting for him
at his office.

91
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:47,351
How can someone be too short
to be a jockey?

92
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,320
Isn't that
the whole point?

93
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:52,790
Are you all right, Max?

94
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,457
I got here
as fast as I could.

95
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,193
Caroline texted me
to hurry over

96
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,995
because you didn't know
you were pregnant,

97
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:59,296
and you were giving
birth over toilet.

98
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:03,133
So I grabbed
my plunger and ran!

99
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:06,402
That is insane.
I never texted that.

100
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:09,906
No, I did,
when I stole your phone.

101
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,141
I needed a reason
to get Sophie over here.

102
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:14,143
I can't believe
she believed it.

103
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,679
Oh, come on, Max.
Giving birth over toilet?

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,149
That is very you.

105
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,417
Now that you are here,
Sophie, sit.

106
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,519
I want to tell you
something important.

107
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,387
Well, you can forget that.

108
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:28,156
There's no way
I'm going to stay.

109
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:31,592
A cupcake party?

110
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:35,330
Oh, look, and this one
even has a pretzel in it.

111
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,365
Yup, that's
our "salty n' spice"

112
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,933
for our more
adventurous customers.

113
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,235
Also for
the uptight white people,

114
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:43,037
we have
the very, very vanilla

115
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,573
which is... big surprise...
My favorite.

116
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,709
And this is our beer-batter
maple bacon

117
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,510
spring break cupcake.

118
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:55,114
That's for stoners,
and big surprise, my favorite.

119
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:57,416
We can only
take four flavors

120
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,252
to represent
our cupcake business.

121
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:04,557
See? Not one word ever
about anyone else.

122
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:07,327
I have a pet ferret,
if anyone gives a damn.

123
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,262
Well, I have
some big news

124
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:12,464
I want to share with you
all as well.

125
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,467
Sophie, that classy lady
right over there...

126
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:19,872
[Muffled]
Mm, I like this one.

127
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:22,207
She recently
broke it off with me

128
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,641
because she wanted
to be with a man

129
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,810
who had a dream
and a drive.

130
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,246
So I have bought
a drive...

131
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,114
A Lincoln town car.

132
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:33,217
Yes, I have a new car service
and slogan:

133
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:37,854
"Lie back and I will ride you
till you tell me to stop."

134
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,960
So, oleg, you now have
a town car business?

135
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:46,796
And Sophie,
you rent town cars all the time.

136
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,731
Oh, oh, please.

137
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:51,301
I mean, I love pizza, too,
but that doesn't mean

138
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:54,870
I have to marry papa John.

139
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,641
I was just thinking,
you might want to come out back

140
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,478
and take a look at the light-up
makeup mirror on visors.

141
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,082
Light-up makeup mirror?

142
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,784
Oh, I might be interested.

143
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,986
But not just you and I.

144
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:14,188
Han will come as well.

145
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,258
Finally! Han is getting
invited to something.

146
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,193
Other than LinkedIn.

147
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:21,930
- So much for the taste test.
- It's fine.

148
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,798
I know what's best
for our cupcake business.

149
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,565
I do say that a lot,

150
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,200
but I think
it's kind of charming.

151
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,268
I'll go get our coats.

152
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:31,438
Mm, mm, mm.
Look at you.

153
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,607
I must say, I'm impressed
with how far you've come.

154
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,276
Well, you burn
a few thousand cupcakes,

155
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:37,544
you're bound
to get better.

156
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,679
Not just the cupcakes, Max.

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
Look how far <i>you've</i> come.

158
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,982
When I think of that girl
who came in here

159
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,283
just looking to get by...

160
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,385
Hey, and check you out now.

161
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:49,989
Big, fancy meeting in Manhattan.
Lordy lord!

162
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,058
- It's only a meeting, Earl.
- Maybe.

163
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,560
But if you were
one of these horses,

164
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:59,164
I'd put all
of my money on you, Max.

165
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,832
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

166
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,300
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

167
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,202
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

- [Telephone rings]
- Poor kid.

169
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:06,972
If I had that job,
I'd be asking someone

170
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,074
to please hold a gun
to my head.

171
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,476
He's probably excited
to be working for Paul Platt.

172
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:12,843
Look at
all these magazines

173
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:15,045
calling him
the next Martha Stewart.

174
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:17,247
Someday, we'll have
articles about us.

175
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:18,748
You know,
pictures of you and me

176
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:19,749
standing outside
our country home.

177
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,318
Hold on.

178
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,055
We're rich and still
living together?

179
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:27,224
Okay, she's leaving.
This is us.

180
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,891
About time.

181
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,793
Been sitting here so long
my ass is asleep,

182
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:34,197
which kind of goes against
my theory that it won't quit.

183
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,599
Hi, Paul's going to be
a little longer.

184
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,766
It's fine.
It's just...

185
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,268
Paul Platt parties,
please hold.

186
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,436
- Paul Platt parties...
- How much longer...

187
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:43,439
- Please hold.
- Me or them?

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,474
I got the ass
pins and needles.

189
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,876
- Max.
- What? We're on hold.

190
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:50,912
Have a seat.
Five more minutes.

00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,482
Paul Platt parties.

193
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:54,716
The word "party"
at a party planner's?

194
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,251
Little obvious.

195
00:07:56,252 --> 00:08:00,954
Like me having art that says
"will die alone."

196
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,589
Wait.

197
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,625
I think this is Johnny's art.
No way.

198
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:07,194
"No way" is right.
Johnny's a nobody.

199
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,430
Paul Platt wouldn't have
a framed "Johnny" in his office.

200
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,033
Look, signed "j. Peg."
That's his tag.

201
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,001
Yo, what's the deal
with this art?

202
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,536
It's a street artist.

203
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,602
Everyone's getting
really into him now.

204
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,138
Oh, yeah?

205
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,642
He was trying to get into me
a few months ago.

206
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,277
It was more emotional
than that.

207
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,212
He cheated on
his girlfriend with her

208
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:27,480
and then blew her off.

209
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,482
It was really hard
for us.

210
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,284
And you thought
me slapping my ass

211
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,153
in front of him
was inappropriate?

212
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:37,722
- Wow, Johnny made it.
- Well, good for him.

213
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:39,358
He's making it,
we're making it...

214
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,659
We're making it?

215
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,062
I magic-markered
over the scuffs on my boot,

216
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,563
and we can't
even get past

217
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:47,799
the poor man's John Cusack
over there.

218
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,034
Max, we <i>are</i> making it.

219
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,635
We've come a long way.

220
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:52,836
We haven't used
Starbucks napkins

221
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:55,106
for toilet paper
in months.

222
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:56,674
And now,
look where we are.

223
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,177
We've got a meeting
with Paul Platt.

224
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:01,512
Say it:
"We're making it."

225
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,314
I'm serious.
Say it, Max.

226
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:04,414
We are making it.

227
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:06,015
Okay, we're making it.

- Caroline channing.
- This is us!

- Ahh.
- What, five more minutes?

230
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:15,192
Monday at 4:00.
Something came up.

231
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:17,327
Oh, okay.
Well, Monday at 4:00.

232
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,028
There's no Monday at 4:00.

233
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,163
He said Monday at 4:00.
Monday at 4:00, right?

234
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,031
Absolutely.
Monday at 4:00.

235
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,601
[Whispers]
There is no Monday at 4:00.

236
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:28,104
I'm confused.
Is there a Monday at 4:00?

237
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,473
In the books, Monday at 4:00.
Paul can't wait.

238
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,075
There is
no Monday at 4:00.

239
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:36,044
I don't understand.
Are we coming in Monday at 4:00?

240
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:38,045
Absolutely.
Paul's a big fan.

[Whispers]
Don't come in on Monday.

242
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,618
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

243
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,721
See, it's this news
about your father being moved

244
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:49,491
to a cushy white collar
prison this week.

245
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,259
Paul can't have anything to do
with someone named channing,

246
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,060
'cause everyone
in New York is pissed.

247
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,498
Look at all that.
It never stops.

248
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,299
How much more of this
do I have to take?

249
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,700
So we'll see you
on Monday!

[Whispers]
Don't come.

251
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,539
I woke my ass up
for this?

252
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:13,056
Mmm.
This was delicious, Max.

253
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,425
Here's a $20.
Keep the change.

What are you doing,
Sophie?

00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:18,495
You don't pay
for the cupcakes.

256
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:20,097
No, take it
for your business.

257
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:23,432
Ever since your big
party planner meeting went bust,

258
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,934
I was worried
that you two girls

259
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,636
might form
a joint suicide pact.

260
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:33,109
Nah, we're
not that organized.

261
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,611
So how's Caroline today?

262
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:37,712
She's handling it all
better than I thought.

263
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:39,214
She's with her father's
lawyer right now,

264
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:40,982
trying to figure out
the best time for her

265
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,784
to go out to the prison
to see him before he's moved.

just invite oleg inside?

I'm not sure yet
he deserves to come inside.

he's already come inside.

00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:21,020
the prison is surrounded
by so much press

281
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,288
that daddy doesn't want me
to come out there

and be exploited
all over again.

Why is he still
the only news story out there?

Well, the good news is,

your hair
is especially shiny today.

It is?

287
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,901
So try not
to kill yourself.

at my old P.O. box.

291

My father's lawyer
picked it up for me.

292
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,880
Why didn't he just punch you
in the face and call it a day?

293
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:52,083
I know, it's like the end of

Oh, come on, not everyone
is calling you a bitch.

I hate you."

"If I ever see you
on the street, I will..."

Shake your hand
and wish you well,

299
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,632
as you have been through
so very much.

300
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,333
That is not
what that says.

301
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,835
It might be.

It's hard to read
his actual words,

as they are
written in blood.

304

Oh, look how fancy.
This is not hate mail.

305
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:24,880
No, this is invitation to
metropolitan museum annual gala.

306
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,481
It is?

307

This is my favorite social event
in all of New York.

308

I've gone every year
since I was 18.

309

It's a fashion ball
at the museum of art...

00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:34,489
Yeah, I know
what it is.

311

- I catered it last year.
- Max, how weird.

right in the very same room.

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,629
Then there's a good chance
I spit in your drink.

314
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,532
Not really, unless you were
acting all prissy and demanding.

315
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,867
There's a good chance
you spit in my drink.

316
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:50,571
Well, see?
This is happy news.

317
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:53,205
No, as much as I want to,
I can't go.

318
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,574
Everybody hates me.

319
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:57,209
And much worse,
I have nothing to wear,

320
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,346
and if you're gonna be hated,
you better look damn good.

321
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:04,216
I give up. That invitation
finally broke me.

322
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,118
Why are you
pulling down your bed?

323
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,320
Because I don't have
a door to slam.

324
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,155
Hell, I don't even
have a door!

325
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,190
Everything's
been taken away, Max...

326
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,225
My fortune,
my business career,

327
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,595
my social life,
my sweet, sweet horse.

328
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,997
Okay, take a nap.
You're upset.

329
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,198
You have
a good reason to be.

330
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,067
<i>A</i> good reason?

331
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,836
I say she has
200, 300 good reasons.

332
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,171
I mean, read these.

333
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:30,174
These are like
letters to the devil.

334
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:34,244
I'm just going to get in there
and never get out.

335
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,346
Close it up, Max.
Put me in the wall.

336
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:38,749
No, it's really hard to
close it when you're in there.

337
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,350
I've tried.

338
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,719
Look, I know
it's not even remotely close

339
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,054
to what you had before,

340
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,622
but we do have
our cupcake business

341
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:49,893
and our purple stove,
and we do have $922.

342
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,260
And we're gonna make it.

343
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:55,264
Wall me.

344
00:13:55,265 --> 00:14:00,703
Come on, all you need
is a big, glamorous party.

345
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,638
I mean, look at
all the celebrities

346
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,708
that are on the list:
Martha Stewart,

347
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,576
Justin Timberlake...

348
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:10,445
[Gasps]
Ooh, Hugh Jackman!

349
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:12,581
Oh, I like to call him
"huge" Jackman,

350
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,316
because I bet
he has a big penis.

351
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:19,053
Wall me.

352
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:27,795
- [Horn honks]
- Thank you, sir.

353
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,030
Welcome home, buddy.

354
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:32,165
As you can see,
we haven't put the pool in yet.

355
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,667
We'll get to it.

356
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:36,637
Tree, grill, shovel...
Usual cast of characters.

357
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:39,106
Now, I am going
to take you in to her,

358
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:40,507
but I should warn you.

359
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,743
She hasn't been
out of bed for two days,

360
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:45,811
and that means no tooth brushing
and it's bad up in there.

361
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,647
I'm pretty sure horses
have a keen sense of smell,

362
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:49,148
so just be prepared.

363
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,017
[Chestnut whickers]

364
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:53,819
I missed you, too.

365
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,321
- [Hoofbeats approaching]
- [Groans]

366
00:14:56,322 --> 00:15:00,792
Max, I'm trying to sleep.
Take your boots off.

367
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:03,161
Caroline,
I have something for you.

368
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:06,330
Go away.
I'm dead.

369
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:10,434
Jeez, and you said
my breath was bad.

370
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:12,937
You have a visitor,
someone you love.

371
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:14,706
- [Chestnut whickers]
- [Gasps]

372
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:19,543
Chestnut!
Chestnut, hi, baby, hi.

373
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,278
How did he get here?

374
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,813
I went to peach
and told her

375
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,014
it was a matter
of life and death

376
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:25,515
and we had
to have him back.

377
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,551
And what,
she just gave him back to you?

378
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,320
Well, I did have to agree
to come back and babysit

379
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,322
one day a week
for the rest of my life,

380
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:34,523
but hell, Chestnut's home.

381
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:37,226
Max, thank you so much.
You brought me back to life.

382
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,861
Oh, my God,
don't exhale on me.

383
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:41,463
Your breath is like you
went down on a brussels sprout.

384
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,700
Tip your head that way.

385
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,135
[Baby voice]
Chestnut, Chestnut.

386
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:48,037
Don't breathe
on him either!

387
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:51,073
His whole head is a nose.
He can't handle that.

388
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:54,810
Chestnut's home.
[Coos]

389
00:15:58,409 --> 00:15:59,509
Han, I'm so excited.

390
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,876
Did you hear
my horse is back?

391
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,245
This is
not conversation.

392
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,247
This is just
the other thing you say.

393
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,015
"My cupcake business,
my horse,

394
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,484
my horse,
my cupcake business."

395
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,818
Well, in case
anyone's interested,

396
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,955
my ferret's name
is Alvin.

397
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,390
And Alvin's
telling his friends

398
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,992
he has a pet named han.

399
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,994
Hey, Earl.
Long time, no see.

400
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,564
Well, well, well,
Johnny.

401
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,499
If it isn't
the famous street artist.

402
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,934
Well, I'm hardly famous.

403
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,235
You got that right.

404
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:31,738
My remark was
laced with sarcasm.

405
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:34,274
Can you tell Max
I'm here?

406
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:37,277
That depends.
Are you still a two-timing bum?

407
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,547
That's his name,
don't wear it out.

408
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:41,948
Hiya, slugger.

409
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:45,017
Can you do me a favor
and call Earl off?

410
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,487
I may be on day six
of my p90x,

411
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:50,422
but I'm in no shape to take on
a heavyweight like him.

412
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:53,158
[Clears throat]
It's okay, Earl, we're cool.

413
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,594
Well, I am.
He's just riding my fumes.

414
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,762
So, uh,
where's your section?

415
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:02,396
- Counter.
- Hm, same ol', same ol'.

416
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,770
Johnny's in the diner.

417
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:09,107
Why is he here?
It can't be to eat.

418
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,976
He's "made it."
He eats "made it food" now.

419
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,545
Well, obviously,
he's here to see you.

420
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:17,081
Or else he won the award for
biggest lying jerk in New York,

421
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:19,484
and this is the first stop
on his press tour.

422
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:20,485
Well, I don't know
why he's here,

423
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,185
but you better
come with me.

424
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,221
He looks really good,
so I'm not listening

425
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:26,856
to a thing coming out of
his pretty mouth.

426
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,227
Well, I was gonna
ask what the specials were,

427
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,894
but you know what?
Can I actually just get

428
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,263
one of Max's
homemade cupcakes?

429
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:36,266
- Okay, which flavor?
- Surprise me.

430
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:39,034
Kind of like how you surprised
her with your girlfriend?

431
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:42,171
Okay, I'm starting
to get a vibe here,

432
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:44,140
and that's why I came in,
because I feel bad,

433
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,675
the way things
went down between us,

434
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,077
and I came to say good-bye
because I'm moving.

435
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:51,079
Oh, moving.
To where?

436
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,748
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

437
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:55,883
That hardly calls
for a good-bye speech.

438
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,885
It's over there.

439
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,021
Yeah, I know,
but it's a big change for me,

440
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,088
and we're not going
to be rolling

441
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02,757
in the same circles
anymore,

442
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:07,094
and I'm getting married...
Over there.

443
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:09,763
Well, at least you and
your girlfriend worked it out.

444
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:11,131
Actually, we broke up.

445
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,368
This is someone
I met a couple months ago.

446
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:17,670
I was only
watching his lips,

447
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:22,475
but did they just say
what I think they said?

448
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,077
Well, there's your cupcake.
That'll be $5.

449
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:28,548
The price has gone up.
Yeah, we're successful now.

450
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,551
In fact, we may be working
with Martha Stewart.

451
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,818
Caroline knows her
from, you know, before.

452
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,953
We're gonna talk it over
with her

453
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:38,623
at the met gala ball
that Caroline got invited to.

454
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:40,725
Martha's on the committee.
Caroline goes every year.

455
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,527
Not a big deal.

456
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:44,429
My first time.
Not a big deal either.

457
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,830
In fact, none of it's
a big deal,

458
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:48,132
just two girls
who are making it

459
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,735
but who choose to stay
in Brooklyn 'cause we're cool.

460
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:54,104
That's awesome, Max.
That's awesome.

461
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:55,673
It's just funny,
because whenever I think of you,

462
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:59,976
I think of you in this diner
in that uniform.

463
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:01,712
In a good way.

464
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:06,816
You want money now?

465
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:08,751
Yeah.
It's business.

466
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,554
It's not like we had
a relationship or anything.

467
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:12,955
In fact,
you can pay Caroline.

468
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:14,990
She's the money.
I'm the artist.

469
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:20,263
You know, I'm doing pretty
well as an artist myself.

470
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:22,163
I've been selling
a lot of my stuff.

471
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,266
Really?
We hadn't heard.

472
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,167
And there's your cupcake.

473
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,570
In case you didn't notice,
that container's to go.

474
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,305
Got it.

475
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,675
He's gone.
I got rid of him.

476
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,944
Max?

477
00:19:35,945 --> 00:19:37,411
What are you doing?

478
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:40,448
Punching cheesecakes.

479
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,850
It's my version
of going to bed for two days.

480
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:44,084
Are you more upset
about the marriage thing

481
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:46,254
or the uniform thing?

482
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,522
Oh, this isn't about Johnny.
I'm mad at the cheesecakes.

483
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:49,957
They were supposed
to have cherries on top,

484
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,026
and I wanted cherries!

485
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:57,029
Why not me?

486
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,267
Okay, maybe it's half
no cherries, half Johnny.

487
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:02,402
Nothing ever
does work out for us.

488
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,404
And then I hear myself saying
all that ridiculous stuff

489
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:06,673
about us talking
to Martha Stewart at the gala.

490
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,308
I mean, what was that?
It's insane.

491
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,476
Is it?

492
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,611
Wait, seriously, is it?

493
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,113
Or is it just insane enough
to be genius?

494
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,783
Max, we have the invitation.
She'll be there.

495
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,318
Why are we wasting our time
with Paul Platt

496
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,753
when we can
meet the real thing?

497
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,488
We can take Martha
our best cupcake,

498
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,955
explain our situation,

499
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,956
and maybe...
Maybe she'll talk to us.

500
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:27,792
I mean, she was a girl
with a dream once, too,

501
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,462
and she certainly
understands hard times.

502
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,399
You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

503
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,235
I am talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart!

504
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,305
I even have my gorgeous Judith
leiber jeweled cupcake purse

505
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,239
to smuggle the cupcake in.
It's perfect.

506
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,709
I knew there was a reason
I took that from the townhouse.

507
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,078
Great, you have a cupcake
and a cupcake purse.

508
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,348
What else are we gonna
wear to the ball, cinderella?

509
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,518
Are the rats in the alley gonna
whip us up some ball gowns?

510
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,986
I mean, it's not exactly
like we have a fairy godmother.

511
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:59,422
Hey, look, girls!

512
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:05,428
I got myself a crown
and a wand at rhinestoned.

513
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:09,064
I'll have the soup
in my booth.

514
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:15,204
Well, this is as close
to a fairytale

515
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,772
as you and I are ever gonna get,
so what the hell?

516
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,274
Max, does that mean
we're gonna find

517
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:20,575
a way to go to the ball?

518
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:23,378
Oh, yeah.
Get your cupcake on,

519
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:27,182
'cause we're gonna
get balled.

520
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,620
Sophie, this is
so generous of you

521
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,521
to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

522
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:37,457
but as much as my shoes
love being back

523
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,593
- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

524
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:43,395
Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

525
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,030
Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

526
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:46,732
at one of
those consignment stores.

527
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,401
"Consignment stores"?

528
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,637
Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

529
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:55,440
This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

530
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,442
Never really been
a fan of balls.

531
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,043
In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

532
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,812
but here we are.

533
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:02,614
Well, we do have
to look amazing

534
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:04,649
if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

535
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,417
so we'll find
a way to pay you back

536
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,920
and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

537
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:12,924
No! Every year
I give money to charity,

538
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,391
and I like
you two girls

539
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,828
way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

540
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:21,164
So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

541
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,734
Aww, a roll of hundreds.

542
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,970
Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

543
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,906
Yeah, this is fun day.

544
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:33,609
I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

545
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,144
Well, when you put it
like that,

546
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm a little
more comfortable.

547
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,049
Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

548
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,985
Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

549
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,586
We have to be
at work by 6:00.

550
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:46,821
Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

551
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:50,091
Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

552
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:51,592
down in ready-to-wear.

553
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,695
As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

554
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,764
We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

555
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:58,199
and picked up
some dresses.

556
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,402
Show her your wad.

557
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:03,671
Let's look
at some dresses.

558
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:05,773
Yeah, and get us
some champagne,

559
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:08,075

Han, did you just go up
on your tiptoes like a big boy?

599
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,612
Well, I wasn't expecting
a photo opportunity.

600
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:00,814
And I left my tom cruise
man-heels at home.

601
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,416
Max, give him a break.

602
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,618
This is a man who was
too short to be a jockey.

603
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:05,753
Oleg, give me your camera.

604
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,220
I must approve picture.

605
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,989
We've taken it
three times already.

606
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,924
Han, if you want
a nip slip, just ask.

607
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:14,527
My dress is too pretty
for this conversation,

608
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,962
so I'm gonna go get the cupcake
from the refrigerator.

609
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:20,300
And I'm going to warm up
my new town car for the ladies.

610
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,702
New?
[Laughs]

611
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:25,971
What is this, 2002?

612
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:27,506
I hope so,

613
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:29,908
then I will have chance
to meet you for first time

614
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:32,010
all over again.

615
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:35,914
Now this is not
professional driver talk.

616
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,917
Hey, fancy ball Buster,
what's your deal?

617
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:40,352
You told him to get
a dream and a drive,

618
00:25:40,353 --> 00:25:41,520
and he did.

619
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:43,921
Max, I have two sore spots.

620
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,989
Trusting men and...

621
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,325
And here, where that
crazy Jamaican

622
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:49,760
wove my extensions
too tight.

623
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,796
I'm thinking I should wait
to put the cupcake

624
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,831
in the cupcake purse
till we get out of the car.

625
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,599
We want our beer batter
maple bacon cupcake

626
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,368
to represent
our cupcake business.

627
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:58,869
We have a new record.

628
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,172
She cupcake four times
in one speech.

629
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,941
We should go.
Upper East Side from Brooklyn

630
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,809
at this time of day
is crazy.

631
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,644
But we came in here
to show Earl.

632
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:09,845
Maybe Earl decided
not to come

633
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:11,347
since he had the night off.

634
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,449
Max, we really should
be there at the start.

635
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,084
That's prime Martha Stewart
stalking time.

636
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:17,453
You're right.
And Martha will probably

637
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:18,821
have to leave early
to get up to bake;

638
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:20,823
A little something
I knows about.

639
00:26:20,824 --> 00:26:22,757
The only difference
between Martha and I

640
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:24,191
is she probably doesn't
have to worry about

641
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,660
waking up her roommate
who lives

642
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:26,961
four feet from the oven.

643
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:29,864
But otherwise, twinsies!

644
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:35,837
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

645
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,772
Earl, slow down,
your heart.

646
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:38,872
Sorry I'm late, ladies.

647
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:40,640
But if I run any faster,
the cops

648
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,510
tend to pull guns on me.

649
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:44,978
Got held up
at the florist shop,

650
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,146
but I made it.
Here you go, ladies.

651
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,083
Aww, Earl,
you got us flowers?

652
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,451
Wrist corsages.

653
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:52,786
I hope they're still
in style.

654
00:26:52,787 --> 00:26:54,387
They're a classic, Earl.

655
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,888
Like you.

656
00:26:58,157 --> 00:27:01,927
Mmm, that was
worth the run.

657
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,061
Let's go, ladies.

658
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:06,031
Oleg is waiting
to drive you.

659
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:08,934
And you drive me crazy.

660
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,235
Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to the marines.

661
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:12,937
Here, Earl,
take my phone.

662
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:15,740
I can't fit it
in the purse with my cupcake.

663
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,942
Have the best time
in the world.

664
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,378
And say hello
to "huge" Jackman for me.

665
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:23,347
[Laughs]

666
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,450
[Engine rattling]

667
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:28,084
[Engine dying]

668
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:32,022
That is not a good sign.

669
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:34,591
That car is smoking harder
than Bob Marley

670
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:37,260
on a rasta holiday.

671
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,004
Sophie, if my cousin Yuri
said he would be here

672
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:45,939
in half hour
with parts to fix,

673
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,907
he will be here
in half hour.

674
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:49,075
Actually, it's been
40 minutes.

675
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:50,977
Your cousin is like you.

676
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:54,347
- He takes too long to come.
- Oh, this is news.

677
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:57,183
Suddenly a woman
wants a man to finish fast.

678
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:58,651
Oh, please.

679
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,819
Sex is not
a carnival cruise.

680
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,021
I'm a busy woman.

681
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:04,256
You get on,
you get off.

682
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,125
Can I get a hit off that?

683
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:08,193
We'll just have to wait,
I guess.

684
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:10,696
I mean, if I still lived
in Manhattan, I'd hail a cab.

685
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:13,165
But that's not gonna happen
out here in the boondocks!

686
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,999
Plus, even if we could
afford a cab,

687
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,368
we'd be stuck forever
in rush hour gridlock.

688
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:18,703
Could you take it down
a notch?

689
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:20,004
Hipsters are starting
to look at us

690
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:21,939
like we're trying too hard.

691
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,474
Where did han go?

692
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:25,043
He said he might
have a plan.

693
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:28,112
Oh, my lord and Taylor!

694
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:42,625
That little mother
can ride.

695
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:52,702
You two look like
two princesses in a fairy tale.

696
00:28:52,703 --> 00:28:54,203
Are you feeling safe?

697
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:55,637
I couldn't feel any safer

698
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:58,074
if we were riding
a rubber into town.

699
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:59,641
Here we go.
Bye, guys.

700
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:02,711
- Bye.
- Go, Chestnut!

701
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:14,923
Oh, check it out.
You see what I see?

702
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:16,591
Hello, officers.

703
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:18,158
We're on way to the ball
down the street,

704
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,459
and we were wondering
if we could please leave

705
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,128
our horse with your horses?

706
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:22,462
And I can save you
the time

707
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,764
on the breathalyzer test;

708
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,465
No, we are not drunk

709
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,567
or on some bachelorette
party scavenger hunt.

710
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:28,969
Our car broke down
in Brooklyn,

711
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,738
so we rode over
the Brooklyn bridge and up.

712
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:33,440
You rode a horse
across the Brooklyn bridge?

713
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:35,407
That's badass.

714
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,676
Yes...
And illegal.

715
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:40,012
In that case,
we took the tunnel.

716
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,581
Well, I think we can help
you two ladies.

717
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:44,751
Not gonna happen, Dave.
We're on duty.

718
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:46,719
Officers, we're already
a little late.

719
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,420
And with all due respect,
we don't have time

720
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:50,021
to play good cop,
bad cop.

721
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:53,424
Or in your cases,
hot cop, hot cop.

722
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,228
Well, I think we can help
you ladies.

723
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,763
Let's get you down
off of there.

724
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:00,331
I got the one
in the low-cut.

725
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:04,369
Thanks officer hot
and officer hotter.

726
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,170
You know I'm officer hotter,
right?

727
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,537
Oh, come on, man.
Have you seen me

728
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:10,440
in my sunglasses?
No contest.

729
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,914
Max, I'm really impressed
with how well

730
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,715
you're maneuvering around
in that long skirt.

731
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,851
Yeah, I was a serving wench
at a medieval times restaurant.

732
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:23,386
It's a breeze
when I'm not carrying

733
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:26,689
a tray loaded
with Turkey legs and ale.

734
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,524
There's the "will call"
table.

735
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:30,393
Walk in front
and I'll hide behind you,

736
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,929
as I'm the most hated woman
in New York.

737
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,630
So basically,
I'm a human shield?

738
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,700
Well, you have more up here
to stop anything.

739
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,368
- Max!
- What?

740
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,569
Did someone pull a gun?

741
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,305
I knew that
was gonna happen.

742
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,073
No, I screamed because
I saw the couple

743
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:48,343
whose sworn statement
put my father in prison.

744
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:49,644
Max!

745
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:51,013
Acid in your pretty face?

746
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,714
Sorry, I stayed up
all night reading

747
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,982
what people want to do
to you in your hate mail.

748
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,818
What was it?

749
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:59,720
I went down so fast,
I may have smeared my cupcake.

750
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:02,790
That's the filthiest sounding
clean thing I ever heard.

751
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,725
It's fine. Good.

752
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,760
Now let's go get those cheap
plastic security bracelets

753
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:10,430
that ruin
our expensive gowns.

754
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:12,332
- Can I get your name?
- Caroline...

755
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,599
[Whispers]
Channing.

756
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,901
I'm sorry, what?

757
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:15,902
Caroline...

758
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:17,503
[Quietly]
Channing.

759
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,206
What's with you?
Just say your name.

760
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:20,573
Channing.

761
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,509
Did you say channing?
Caroline channing?

762
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,678
Wait, are you
<i>that</i> Caroline channing?

763
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,448
Shh, yes, and I personally
called the R.S.V.P. number.

764
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:30,749
It has to be there.

765
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,319
Channing,
channing, channing...

766
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,520
No, I don't see
"Caroline channing."

767
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,622
Shh.
Maybe it's under my name.

768
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:39,424
Max black.
I'm with her.

769
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:42,961
Black... no, no, no,
I don't see any blacks here.

770
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:45,964
You mean besides
the ones working security?

771
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:49,267
Let me check with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

772
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:50,735
He's on the phone
with him right now.

773
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:54,272
Hey, Brody.
Both: Oh, no.

774
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,875
There's a problem
with the list.

775
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:58,942
She's not on it.
Her.

776
00:31:58,943 --> 00:32:01,111
- Caroline channing.
- Sh

777
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,445
Paul, I've got
Caroline channing,

778
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:03,981
and she's not on the list.

779
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:07,217
If everybody in this line
could just wait until

780
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,921
we get the Caroline channing
situation under control...

781
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,490
If you say "channing"
one more time,

782
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,758
I'm going to actually
pull your voice box out.

783
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,227
And its s so much
more violent than it sounds.

784
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,695
Yes, Paul,
I'll tell them.

785
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,063
There's been
a little mix-up.

786
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,498
Five more minutes
will get you right in.

787
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:26,068
[Whispering]
You're not getting in.

788
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,138
Well, that's it.
We tried.

789
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,838
- We gave it our best shot.
- Oh, no.

790
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,740
This is the closest
I have ever gotten

791
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,143
to anything in my life
almost working out.

792
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:37,678
- We are not giving up.
- How are we getting in?

793
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,315
- Security's everywhere.
- Yeah, out here,

794
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:41,783
but not
at the servers' entrance.

795
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:43,418
I catered this
last year.

796
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,153
That's right,
we're going backdoor.

797
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:48,588
Ooh!

798
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,926
That lady
just punched me.

799
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:55,095
I knew
that was gonna happen!

800
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:04,971
So you can
just walk in here?

801
00:33:04,972 --> 00:33:06,940
Anyone can
just walk right in?

802
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,607
Well, it helps
that last year

803
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,176
I made out with
the tent flap guard, Rico,

804
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:12,145
but basically,
yeah, anyone.

805
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,679
When I think
of all the times

806
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,614
I left my purse
on a table here unattended,

807
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:18,383
I shudder...
Shudder.

808
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:20,852
Okay, so we can't
get in the actual building

809
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:22,354
without being caterers,

810
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:23,655
so we have to change
into those uniforms.

811
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:24,990
Wait.

812
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:26,123
You never mentioned
anything about

813
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:27,658
a rent-a-clothes
situation.

814
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,361
Small price to pay
for us making it.

815
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:34,966
Is it? Is it
a <i>small</i> price to pay?

816
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:39,937
Hurry, we have
a superstar to stalk!

817
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:42,205
I thought I would hate it,
but I'm kind of into it.

818
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:43,873
I'm very Janelle Monae.

819
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:46,576
No, you're Janelle
I-have-no-Monae.

820
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:48,644
What are we going to do
with our dresses?

821
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:50,480
We can't leave them out here.
I need them inside.

822
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:52,415
I have to look amazing
when I meet Martha Stewart.

823
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,250
What does it matter
what we're wearing?

824
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:55,852
We're still going to be
the two crazy girls

825
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:57,887
chasing her down
with a cupcake.

826
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:00,356
- That's why it matters.
- Oh, ooh!

827
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:01,756
I know.
Here.

828
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,125
Help me get
the shelves out of this.

829
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,360
We can hang
our dresses in here

830
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,228
and push them in.
Brilliant.

831
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:08,530
Kind of like the Louis Vuitton
travel wardrobe I used to have.

832
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:12,368
Or the service elevator
I was born in.

833
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:15,903
Coming through, hot food.

834
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:17,771
Look out, very hot!
Man, it's hot.

835
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:19,040
You're a waiter,
not a weatherman.

836
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,674
Hey, pretty girls,

837
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,011
I like the way you push around
that big steel box

838
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:26,280
why don't you come over here
and I'll have sex with you?

839
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:29,450
A display like that
really makes you appreciate

840
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,318
oleg's nuanced wit.

841
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:36,056
Okay, let's go right
to the ladies room

842
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,290
so we can change.

843
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:40,060
Is it that way
or that way?

844
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:41,194
What?

845
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,595
Shh, Johnny!

846
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,764
How'd he get invited?

847
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:46,832
This used to be
an exclusive event.

848
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,100
He's "made it,"

849
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:49,801
he goes where
"made it" people go.

850
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:51,770
Why are we hiding
from that lowlife?

851
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:54,440
If he sees me
in another waiter uniform,

852
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:56,442
I'm the sad girl
always in the uniform.

853
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,210
If he sees me
in that dress at the ball,

854
00:34:58,211 --> 00:34:59,245
he can suck it.

855
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:03,148
Ladies room, that way.

856
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,354
The ladies room
is right down here.

857
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:12,823
Push harder. Harder!

858
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:15,060
Do you want Martha
to see you dressed like that?

859
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:16,561
- Move! Coming through!
- Excuse us.

860
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:18,929
Food emergency.

861
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,264
Fingers, fingers,
fingers, fingers.

862
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:21,765
Coming through,
coming through.

863
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:22,999
- Excuse us.
- Look alive, red!

864
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,502
- I almost hit you.
- Hold up.

865
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:27,471
Now just hold up.
What is going on right now?

866
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,039
You can't bring
food in here.

867
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,208
Oh, it's not food.
That would be weird.

868
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,544
It's dresses.
We have to change into these,

869
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:35,010
'cause she has this guy
she wants to impress,

870
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:36,412
and I have to change
into it

871
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:38,247
because I'm stalking
Martha Stewart.

872
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:40,983
Ooh, I'd be
a terrible spy.

873
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:42,351
Usually I don't get
the long stories

874
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:43,652
till the end of the night,

875
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,121
and by then,
the girls are crying

876
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:47,723
and begging me
for Wisdom and tic tacs.

877
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:49,092
I'll go first.

878
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,625
I have to get two of these
in one dress.

879
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,561
Miss, do you have
a shoehorn?

880
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:02,207
Come on,
chanel shoes!

881
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:05,510
Come on,
chanel knockoffs.

882
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,712
Why are you
not dressed yet?

883
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:08,947
'Cause ladies take forever.

884
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,982
It's all the spanx.

885
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:13,719
Well, go, use my stall.
I want to go stick my head out,

886
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,187
and see if I
can scope out Johnny.

887
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:19,323
No, ma'am, no!
Not fair, ma'am.

888
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:21,291
Try the handicapper.
This side.

889
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:23,561
Good idea.

890
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:27,598
I cannot
get a break tonight.

891
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:33,236
- Psst, yo, Max.
- Johnny!

892
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:35,171
Who are you looking for?

893
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:37,206
The Dominos guy.

894
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,808
I was hiding in there,
'cause five more minutes,

895
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:40,410
the pizza's free.

896
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,545
I was hoping
I'd run into you.

897
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:43,913
Eh, no big deal.

898
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:45,982
Pretty big deal.
You look amazing.

899
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:50,051
Amazing. I will go
as far as amaze-balls.

900
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:51,687
Thanks.

901
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:53,088
You look like a guy
in a commercial

902
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:55,824
who has a ring and puppy
hidden somewhere.

903
00:36:55,825 --> 00:36:57,493
Can you believe it?

904
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,294
We're both
at this shmancy thing.

905
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:00,763
Look how far we've gotten.

906
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:03,231
Actually,
when you think about it,

907
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:07,502
we didn't get
very far at all.

908
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:09,437
Nope, you're right.
We didn't.

909
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:13,541
Yeah, why?

910
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,710
Timing, I guess.

911
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:18,746
Timing?

912
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:20,180
Okay, whatever.

913
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:23,483
You know, from now on,
when I think of you,

914
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:26,753
I'm gonna think of you in this
and not the uniform.

915
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:29,923
You know,
from now on,

916
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:33,860
maybe you shouldn't
think of me at all.

917
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:35,495
Gotta go,
Mr. Manhattan.

918
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:41,867
That was awesome!
Caroline, where are you?

919
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,268
I'm almost dressed.

920
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,971
I just had the perfect
in-your-face good-bye

921
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,205
with Johnny.

922
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:49,675
And speaking of
"in your face,"

923
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,944
he couldn't take his eyes
off my boobs...

924
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:53,878
Boobs that
he can never have,

925
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:57,214
now that
he's getting married.

926
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:59,717
[Sighs]

927
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:01,886
Damn, girl, you look good.
What you doing later?

928
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:07,425
Can I get your number?

929
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:11,061
Oh, no, the cupcake got
a little smushed in my purse.

930
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:13,730
We can't show this
to Martha Stewart now.

931
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,298
Sure, we can.

932
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:16,500
You think she never
had a cupcake smush on her?

933
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:18,134
[Scoffs]
I doubt that very much.

934
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:20,003
Martha Stewart
is perfect.

935
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:21,872
Her feet don't even
touch the ground.

936
00:38:21,873 --> 00:38:23,774
The woman probably doesn't
even go to the bathroom.

937
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:26,676
[Toilet flushing]

938
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:29,745
Martha Stewart's
hardly perfect.

939
00:38:29,746 --> 00:38:31,881
And how are you
this evening?

940
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,083
No, you're right,
Martha Stewart isn't perfect.

941
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:36,318
Oh, I never said that!

942
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:40,022
In fact, I hear
she's a real ballbuster.

943
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,356
You did not hear that.

944
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:43,291
Yep, a real ballbuster,
you know?

945
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:44,926
No, I do not know.

946
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:50,098
Would you mind handing me
a towelette please?

947
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,367
Oh, one's fine.
Thank you so much.

948
00:38:52,368 --> 00:38:54,703
But the fact that Martha
Stewart <i>is</i> so tough...

949
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:56,670
Caroline, you need
to get out here right now.

950
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:59,940
The fact that she
is a real ballbuster...

951
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:01,775
Oh, dear God, help me.

952
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,443
Is what I like
and respect about her.

953
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:05,112
I mean,
the woman's a genius.

954
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:07,615
Now it's getting
interesting.

955
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:09,049
And besides, you can't
really believe gossip.

956
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,317
Look at all
that hate mail I got

957
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:12,019
with people
calling me a bitch,

958
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,553
and I'm not a bitch.

959
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,989
Well, that's debatable.

960
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,258
- Martha Stewart, hi.
- Hello.

961
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:21,794
I'm Caroline, and this is
my business partner, Max,

962
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:23,530
and we have
a start-up cupcake business.

963
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:26,399
Dude, are you serious?
You're still going for it.

964
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,034
I know this is
highly inappropriate,

965
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,568
but we brought
a cupcake here tonight

966
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,069
in hopes that
you might taste it.

967
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,304
So you want me
to taste your cupcake

968
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:34,806
in the ladies room.

969
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,075
What's inappropriate
about that?

970
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:39,545
We're a start-up business.
We've got to take risks.

971
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:40,913
This is Max.
She's the baker.

972
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:42,280
You're the baker.

973
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,516
[Weakly]
I'm the baker.

974
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:46,150
Hm, it looks
quite appealing.

975
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,519
Oh, my God.

976
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,120
I know this
is a social event,

977
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,322
so I'm so sorry
for making it about business.

978
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,691
When you're in business
for yourself,

979
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,492
you have
to take every situation

980
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,327
as a business opportunity.

981
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,264
Look, I have
five of these in here.

982
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,267
I love your magazine.

983
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,135
I read every single issue

984
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:09,439
until they realized I didn't
even go to that doctor.

985
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,407
Well, in spite
of the fact

986
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:13,443
that you have not
yet washed your hands...

987
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,411
I was just changing
my dress in there.

988
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:17,345
- I'll taste it.
- You will?

989
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:19,982
I like
your entrepreneurial drive.

990
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:22,184
And I have a feeling
that it's actually

991
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:24,419
the only way I'm gonna
get out of here alive.

992
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,058
That is our beer batter maple
bacon spring break cupcake.

993
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,694
- Hm, clever name.
- Thank you.

994
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,360
It is a little smushed,
though. That's unfortunate.

995
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:37,031
I told you.

996
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,435
Mmm.
Quiet tasty.

997
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:43,771
I like it.

998
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:46,273
Do you girls have a card?

999
00:40:46,274 --> 00:40:50,043
Get it out, get it out,
get it out.

1000
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,879
Ah, thank you very much.

1001
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,348
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

1002
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,284
Well, you know who'd
really like that cupcake?

1003
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:00,386
Stoners.

1004
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:05,157
She said
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

1005
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:08,494
Both: Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

1006
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:12,098
Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

1007
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:17,675
