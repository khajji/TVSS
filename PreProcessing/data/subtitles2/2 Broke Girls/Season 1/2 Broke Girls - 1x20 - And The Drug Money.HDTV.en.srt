drug buddy.

156
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,255
I can't believe
I'm doing a drug trial.

157
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:10,591
I won't even use stevia.

158
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:12,026
It'll be fun!

159
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:14,461
Just think of it as
a middle-school sleepover.

160
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,413
But with drugs.

161
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:20,134
Yeah,
a middle-school sleepover.

162
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:22,269
So when
you did this before,

163
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:24,138
you never got
any side effects, right?

164
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,991
Well, no negative ones.
I used to be an "a" cup.

165
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,396
Wow, everybody
looks so normal.

166
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:35,149
This is more like
sorority row than skid row.

167
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:36,650
Hi!
I'm Katie.

168
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,485
Just found out
there's three to a room,

169
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:40,821
and I was wondering if you guys
have chosen a roomie yet.

170
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,373
Wait, there's three
in a room?

171
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,574
Yeah, I know.

172
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,242
You want to be careful
who you get.

173
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:47,661
Anyways,
I'm a self-mutilator,

174
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,965
and, um, I was wondering if
you could keep an eye on me.

175
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:54,001
Just wrestle anything
out of my hands that's sharp.

176
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:55,636
Uh,
you know what, Katie?

177
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,788
We are
self-mutilators too.

178
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,307
So, uh, we kind of
have our hands full.

179
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:03,010
Yeah,
we're gonna be super-busy

180
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:05,179
self-mutilating ourselves.

181
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,847
No worries.

182
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,434
Max, you should have told me
about the bed situation.

183
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,803
Untested experimental drugs
is one thing,

184
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:15,823
but three to a room?
That's barbaric!

185
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:16,991
It'll be fine!

186
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,692
We just have to pick
the right girl.

187
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:21,946
What about, uh,
the one in the raincoat?

188
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,313
She looks stuck-up,

189
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,199
like she'd talk
about herself all night.

190
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:30,170
Yeah, we already
got one of those.

191
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,872
What about, uh...

192
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:33,323
What about
Bob Marley shirt?

193
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:37,711
She looks like
she smells.

194
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:41,715
- Confirmed.
- Right there.

195
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,467
That's who we want.
She looks smart

196
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:44,885
and like she'd
mind her own business.

197
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:48,689
Hey!
What are you up to?

198
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:52,175
Nothing.
Just minding my own business.

199
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:54,011
Hey, want to be
our roommate?

200
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,847
Oh, I just said yes
to a self-mutilator,

201
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,348
but I can get out of it.

202
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,403
She probably
loves rejection.

203
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,738
All right,
ladies, listen up!

204
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,707
- Hey, Max!
- Hi, Toby.

205
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,242
Heads-up,
me, her, and, uh...

206
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:09,376
Excuse me,
what's your name?

207
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:10,878
Oh, it's cool,

208
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,379
we don't have to do,
like, the name thing.

209
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,248
[Scoffs]
A girl after my own heart!

210
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,166
- We're roommates.
- Got it.

211
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,502
Now, since most of you
have done this before,

212
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:19,670
I'll make it quick.

213
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,472
Half of you
will get a placebo.

214
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:24,425
The other half will be a testing
a new drug called gladiva,

215
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:28,896
and no, that's not my stage name
down at the clubs.

216
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:31,231
Okay,
possible side effects

217
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:34,718
may occur over
the next 24 to 48 hours.

tongue-swelling,
suicidal thoughts...

221

I'm having some
right now.

222
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,064
- Itw...
- Inability to walk.

223
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,699
Mm, I hope we get that
'cause that's the only thing

224
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,167
that's gonna keep me here.

225
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,785
And ru...

226

I'm kidding.
That's my joke.

That's his joke.

Good,
'cause I was out the door.

Also, tg,

You want me
to explain those to you?

234
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:14,024
Not until you see one
happening to me.

after "anal leakage."

and play the game of life.

- Your turn.
- What's the point?

243

Clearly, I've already
lost the game of life

244

'cause I'm sitting
in a drug trial

my "A" to "L".

Mm,
it's probably nothing,

but she might be
experiencing ru.

Your middle name
is "Wesbox"?

It was
my grandfather's name.

00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:48,138
forget to wear panties.
He'll be fine.

315
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,690
But that's the thing.

316
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,808
The questions don't say
anything about my father.

317
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,577
They're so cut and dry.

318
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:54,695
They're only asking me
details about things

319
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:56,580
I know nothing about,

320
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,032
and they're not interested in
the things I do know about him.

321
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:02,419
That he's warm, and funny,
and generous, and loving.

322
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,004
Like when I was little,
and he and I

323
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:06,006
would take our plane
to our chalet in deer valley.

324
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,208
Stop. You might as well
rephrase that to

325
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,876
"when he and I
would take our guilty

326
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:12,012
to our guilty
in guilty valley."

327
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,264
Every morning,
before we went skiing,

328
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,849
he would get up
really early and make me

329
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:17,801
his snowflake
cinnamon french toast.

330
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:19,336
Sounds amazing.

331
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,838
And as he dusted
the cinnamon and sugar on top,

332
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,191
he'd say,
"look, sweetheart, it's snowing,

333
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:26,360
snowing just for you."

334
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:29,229
And then he'd cut it
into these little pieces...

335
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:31,348
See? I can't even
get the words out.

336
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,617
No one will ever hear them.
No one will know.

337
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:36,853
I'll know.
I heard them.

338
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,873
Another round?

339
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:45,212
Yeah, I'm just gonna
bring my pillow in there.

340
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,864
I don't think Gladiva's
gonna make it to the market.

341
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:58,236
We'll be doing
the deposition in here.

342
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:01,156
Oh, wow, this is exactly
how it looks on <i>law & order!</i>

343
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,374
Ooh! Ooh!

344
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,908
There's the tiny
typewriter thing

345
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,627
where the actress
who never gets to speak sits!

346
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:10,999
Leo, Leo, take my picture
near the tiny typewriter.

347
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:16,588
Ladies, ladies.
We only have an hour.

348
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,123
We're already behind
because you were late.

349
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,309
Sorry, we had to stop
at the check-cashing place.

350
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:26,431
Yeah, and then a store
to get diapers for a friend.

351
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,850
There, $1,000.

352
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,736
No fuss,
and luckily, no muss.

353
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,071
Max, do you have
the $100 from the cupcakes?

354
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,136
Yeah.

355
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:38,810
Uh, 40... 60...
80... 90...

356
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:43,248
5, 6, 7, and...

357
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,202
100.

358
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,839
Mr. hutchinson,
are you having reflux?

359
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:56,211
No, I-it just became clear
to me what I do for a living.

360
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,830
Okay, uh, Caroline,

361
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,332
if you're ready,
I can bring them in.

362
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,718
Remember,
just stick to the questions

363
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,303
and don't embellish.

364
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:08,356
I prepped her
last night, Leo.

365
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,724
All right,
let's go, Max.

366
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,609
Actually,
I want her to stay.

367
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,778
I'm nervous,
and she makes me feel better.

368
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,515
Yes, I'm her registered
emotional companion.

369
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,451
Well, this is
a legal proceeding,

370
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,653
and that's
a highly unusual request.

371
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,205
But not improbable.
We googled it.

372
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,040
Yeah, she's allowed to have
an emotional companion,

373
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,209
as long as
both attorneys agree.

374
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:31,913
Well, I graduated
top of my class at Harvard,

375
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:36,885
but since you googled it,
I'll try to make that happen.

376
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,921
No, I am unaware
of any of the transactions

377
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:41,005
you just mentioned.

378
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,757
Thank you,
miss channing.

379
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,176
Now, if you'll just bear with me
a little while longer,

380
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,395
I only have a couple more
pertinent questions.

381
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:51,983
Your voice
is unbelievable.

382
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:57,155
You could be
on <i>law & order.</i>

383
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:58,890
Max!

384
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,326
[Groans]

385
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,778
Withdrawn.

386
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,915
Miss channing,
do you have any knowledge

387
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,583
of embezzlement
of any kind taking place

388
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,234
at the channing
investment group?

389
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,954
No,
I had no knowl...

390
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:16,791
Of any su...
[Mumbling]

391
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:17,792
[Nervous laugh]

392
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,294
Could you repeat that?

393
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:23,765
[Mumbling unintelligibly]

394
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,434
Ruh-roh.

395
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:27,769
You're having
a side effect!

396
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,437
Tongue swelling.
Ts!

397
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:32,140
Uh, counselor,
give us one second.

398
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:33,274
What is going on?

399
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,277
[Mumbling]
We took drugs.

400
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,196
Did she just say
"we took drugs"?

401
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:40,949
Very good, Leo.
You must play charades.

402
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:43,451
Look, we did a drug trial
to get money for this.

403
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,203
What's the holdup,
counselor?

404
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:46,821
Just give her some water.
I had this once.

405
00:17:46,823 --> 00:17:47,989
It goes away in an hour.

406
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,707
[Mumbling]
You said you never had

407
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,326
any side effects!

408
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,878
Oh, please.
I died once.

409
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,383
I just didn't want
to scare you.

410
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,618
Miss channing,
are you aware of any accounts

411
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,504
opened under any names
other than your father's?

412
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:06,090
[Mumbling unintelligibly]

413
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,175
Just drink the water.

414
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:10,428
[Mumbling]
One sec.

415
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:12,981
[Mumbling]

416
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:16,133
Uh, does anyone have
a napkin or a bib?

417
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:19,487
$1,100, you gotta have a bib
around here somewhere.

418
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,273
All right,
what's going on here?

419
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:25,309
I was just, uh,
informed my client

420
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:28,830
was part of a drug test
within the last 24 hours.

421
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:33,117
Drug test, Leo?
That's a good one.

422
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,253
Just another
rich girl on drugs.

423
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:38,423
Get her into rehab,
and we'll have to reschedule.

424
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:40,425
We'll have to do this
another time.

425
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:41,542
[Mumbling]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

426
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:43,611
No, no!
She's right!

427
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,663
We don't have the money
to do this another Tim

428
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,933
look, I can tell you right now,
she does not know anything.

429
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:50,218
She doesn't know
about the money,

430
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,636
she doesn't know
about transactions.

431
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,688
She doesn't know
anything about anything.

432
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,856
We are paid up
for three more minutes,

433
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,691
and we are going to
use them!

434
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:00,228
She can't talk, but I know
what she would want to say.

435
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,482
Ladies and gentlemen
of the... room,

436
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:07,518
she would want you to know
who her father really is.

437
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,070
He used to make her
snow toast!

438
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:12,457
And in her words,
he was funny, smart,

439
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:16,661
and a generous lover.

440
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,166
[Mumbling]
Generous <i>and</i> loving!

441
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:24,636
Oh, sorry, yes, yes.
Generous and loving.

442
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:29,173
Now, I don't know her father,
and I have never met him...

443
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:30,892
And I would like you
to put that on the record,

444
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:34,211
actress who's never
allowed to talk...

445
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:37,065
But I do know her,
and she's an amazing person.

446
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,716
And her father
raised her alone,

447
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,886
so he must be
an amazing person too.

448
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:44,221
Well...

449
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:47,058
That accomplished nothing.

450
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,278
Counselor,
what do we do here?

451
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,666
We take a short recess
until she can speak,

452
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:57,368
and resume
the deposition, on me,

453
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,073
because her father
<i>is</i> an amazing guy, and...

454
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,344
That's what they would do
on <i>law & order.</i>

455
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,262
Fine,
we'll break for an hour.

456
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:13,518
Seriously, you sound like
a superhero's boss.

457
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:18,106
[Mumbling]
Max, you're the best.

458
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,775
I know.
I did pretty good, right?

459
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:23,011
I should've gone
to law school.

460
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,197
Or High School.

461
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,989
Permission to enter
the judge's chambers?

462
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:37,709
Permission granted.
Excuse the tubs of bleu cheese.

463
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,210
They're being held
as evidence

464
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:40,945
in the case
against eating here.

465
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:44,215
I wanted to thank you
for everything you did.

466
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,134
And I know you were gonna
buy yourself a treat

467
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:47,135
with the drug money...

468
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,803
Yeah, like drugs.

469
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,389
So I got you
a little something.

470
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,725
It's the complete
<i>law & order</i> box set!

471
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:55,593
No way!

472
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:58,763
That's not a little something.
That's, like, $500.

473
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,848
Or $30 on the subway.

474
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,134
And the guy said
most of them are in english.

475
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,236
Awesome!

476
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:09,090
Freezer adjourned.

477
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:12,341
