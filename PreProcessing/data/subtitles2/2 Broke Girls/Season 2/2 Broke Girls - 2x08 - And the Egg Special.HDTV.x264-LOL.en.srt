00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,182
he was short
and walked with a limp.

159
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,451
And his name was Mad Dog.

160
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:30,486
'Cause I want that
to be his name.

161
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:33,756
No, Max, you know how we've
always wanted our own shop?

162
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:35,124
This is it.

163
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,427
This is Max's homemade cupcakes.

164
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:40,029
Oh.
Yeah, I see that.

165
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,631
And we can put our red velvets
over there

166
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,867
by the random skull fragments.

167
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:47,553
Besides, I thought our shop
was gonna be in Manhattan.

168
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,788
Manhattan's over.

169
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,956
Williamsburg
is the new hot area,

170
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:54,260
and besides Martha's blurb says
we're a Williamsburg must-have,

171
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,128
so we must have this space.

172
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,265
No, we must have the money.

173
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:02,268
I mean, this place has got
to be, like, $4,000 a month.

174
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:04,570
Was.
Was $4,000 a month.

175
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:08,774
That was the pre-tragedy price.

176
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:11,278
When people die,
it's a buyer's market.

177
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,047
You want to rent a room
in that <i>Shining</i> hotel now,

178
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,049
it's, like, 50 bucks a night.

179
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,485
Well, obviously
I wanna start a business

180
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,787
in a place where there
was a shooting spree.

181
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:25,224
And, if we go with red,
it's half painted.

182
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,093
But where are we
gonna get the money?

183
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:29,428
This blurb is our money
in the bank.

184
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:31,230
Oh, yeah, that's another thing
we don't have.

185
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:32,498
A bank.

186
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,500
There are places
set up by women

187
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:37,103
specifically to support
other women's small businesses.

188
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:40,306
I'm talking
girl-on-girl financing.

189
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,908
That's hot.

190
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,844
But I don't care
how much money they offer us.

191
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:47,413
I'm not braiding anyone's hair.

192
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:48,781
But are we ready?

193
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,750
Okay, yes.

194
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,119
This is a big leap of faith,
but we're getting in

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,820
lots of orders now
thanks to the blurb.

196
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,089
And what's the worst thing
that could happen?

197
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,493
Um, maybe these
could be our brains.

198
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,461
No, not gonna happen.

199
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,529
We're gonna kill it.

200
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,331
No disrespect to any spirits

201
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,967
still trying to find
their way into the light.

202
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,301
I'll figure out a place,
and we'll go

203
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:10,936
first thing in the morning.

204
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,838
Find something business-y
to wear, less cleavage.

205
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,775
Oh, these are all business.

206
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:18,310
Great, I'm gonna go find Andy.

207
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:22,381
What is it about real estate
that makes you wanna dry hump?

208
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,152
Max, I'm so excited.

209
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,620
We're getting our dream.

210
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,488
You look like you want a hug.

211
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,958
I do.

212
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,900
Good night.

213
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,694
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes,"

214
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,648
you're up.

215
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,400
Caroline,
why didn't you pick up?

216
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,035
They just called us early,
and I don't know

217
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,653
what to write on the paper.

218
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,039
And I feel like an idiot,
my boobs are suffocating,

219
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,192
and the only "business" thing
I could find was Han's blazer.

220
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:06,795
It's itchy, and there's
a piece of paper in the pocket

221
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,862
with his name on it.

222
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,380
Why would he have that?

223
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,500
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes,"

224
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:13,802
time is money.

225
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,420
Um, here.

226
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,972
But our appointment's
not for another 20 minutes.

227
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,642
Have a seat.

228
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,376
Cool place.

229
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,545
Women's small businesses.

230
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,481
Sisters doing it for themselves.

231
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,399
[Chuckling]
Well, I'm doing it

232
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,852
for the medical benefits.

233
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,154
- Go.
- Oh, now?

234
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,356
Before she gets here?

235
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,909
Um, well, I'm not really much
of a business person.

236
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:42,163
Great way to start
a business loan application.

237
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,564
Go!

238
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,769
You have a minute.

239
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:53,258
Okay, well, um,
how much time do I have now?

240
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,627
Slightly less than a minute.

241
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,047
Okay, uh, my business partner

242
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,049
could explain this
better than me, but I'll try.

243
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,767
[Clears throat]

244
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,019
[Almost inaudible]
We have a cupcake business.

245
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,057
And we bake cupcakes
in my roommate's bedroom.

246
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,392
I can't hear you.

247
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:14,946
You want to write it down,
draw it, shape it in clay?

248
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,699
I would have
filled this out more,

249
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,868
but that chick over there
wouldn't let me cheat off her.

250
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,103
She's not a girl's girl,
know what I mean?

251
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:24,956
Very professional.

252
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,208
Under past loan repayment,

253
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,129
you put, "Paid Todd back
all the beer money I owed."

254
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,965
To be fair,
he was drunk all the time.

255
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,333
I could have just said I did.

256
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,668
Points for honesty.

257
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,471
Let's get you
a new loan application.

258
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,956
Just got your message.

259
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,791
The one time I don't come early.

260
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:48,396
Speaking of that, I just had
the most amazing orgasm.

261
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,014
I mean, we've been having
really great sex,

262
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,401
but this morning,
I could not get enough of his--

263
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,305
projected growth ratio
investment analysis.

264
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,606
Hello, Caroline Channing.

265
00:10:58,608 --> 00:10:59,991
Wharton class of '09.

266
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,410
That's our business proposal.

267
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,811
And I would be
a little embarrassed

268
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:05,330
about what just happened
if I didn't know

269
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,814
that we're all just girls here.

270
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,700
Can we move this along?

271
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:12,036
I got a busted toilet
and a pregnant dog at home.

272
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,374
Why didn't you tell me
she was under there?

273
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,543
Oh, sorry,
I wasn't expecting a monologue

274
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,762
from
<i>Confessions of a Call Girl.</i>

275
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,598
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to deny the loan.

276
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,517
Why? Because she had
a good orgasm?

277
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,771
Isn't that what the '70s
was about for you gals?

278
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,023
You have no business history.

279
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,775
And that's a requirement for us.

280
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,194
Well, I think we're done here.

281
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,646
Yeah.
I just said that.

282
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,014
I thought you guys were

283
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:42,200
about supporting
small women's business.

284
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,019
And this small woman's
"bidness" needs support

285
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,322
after the pounding
it took today.

286
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,574
Max, let's go.

287
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,030
Okay, there's a bank
in New Hampshire

288
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,366
that doesn't check anything.

289
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,035
And before someone else
grabs our cupcake space,

290
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,587
I say we get on a bus
and go up there.

291
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,339
They won't give out
their exact address,

292
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,341
but I know they're in
a mini mall with a white castle.

293
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:07,708
Better idea.

294
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,178
I went to Craigslist,

295
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,764
clicked on "etc" and found

296
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,233
all kinds of opportunities
to make some cash.

297
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,852
I'm fighting the instinct
to weep, but keep going.

298
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:20,388
At first I thought
I might call pit pig.

299
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,906
He just wants
his armpits smelled,

300
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,241
but that's, like, 1,000 sniffs.

301
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,109
Big commitment.

302
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,279
Or there's the weirdo
looking for pretty amputees,

303
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,831
but that feels
like a bigger commitment.

304
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,166
So, check it.

305
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,368
"Egg donors needed.

306
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,686
Ten to twenty grand."

307
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,121
No way,
I could never sell my eggs.

308
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,423
I mean, wouldn't you
hate to think

309
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,841
you had a kid out there
and not know it?

310
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,211
I probably do.

311
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:46,931
In 2006, I invented the Four Loko
and Robitussin smoothie.

312
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,599
It's pretty much
a blackout year.

313
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,386
Seriously, for the right price
I'd sell 'em all.

314
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:52,754
Really?

315
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,822
I mean,
I know you've always been tough.

316
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,090
To hear you tell it,
you were part

317
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,759
of an underground
baby fight club.

318
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,777
But don't you wanna be
a mom some day?

319
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,595
In the history of the world,

320
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,764
give me one example
of a really good mother.

321
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,566
You're putting me on the spot.

322
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,652
All I can think of
is Hilary Duff.

323
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,988
Look, you're complicating this

324
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,990
with these things
you call emotions.

325
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,441
Like it or not...

326
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:15,443
[Bawks like a chicken]

327
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,612
I'm an egg farm.

328
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:20,381
Because we don't know one single
person outside of New Hampshire

329
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,883
who can lend us
that kind of money.

330
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:26,220
Yoo-hoo, girls,
look out the window.

331
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,292
Up here!
It's me!

332
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:35,763
Oleg and I would like
two cupcakes please.

333
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:38,516
I feel weird
asking Sophie for money.

334
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,184
And how do we
even know she has any?

335
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,186
Well, she's building
her dream house in Poland

336
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,138
between a former death camp
and a new W.

337
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,024
She's gotta be loaded.

338
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,192
And Sophie's the kind of woman
who understands our dreams.

339
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,412
Come in.

340
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,785
That's exactly
what I thought would be

341
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,120
on the other side of that door.

342
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:02,006
Oleg, sweetie,
we have company.

343
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,425
I brought you an ass pillow.

344
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,546
Nice to see you like this
outside of work, girls, no?

345
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:12,666
Both: No.

346
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:17,555
Girls, did you see
my big hanging thing?

347
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,274
Yeah, we kinda just saw it.

348
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:25,012
No, I'm talking about my new
ch-andelier for my lake house.

349
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:28,682
Yeah, I can totally see you
drinking ch-ardonnay under it.

350
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,369
Oh, Max, you are so funny.

351
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,254
She's a real ch-aracter.

352
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,740
Yeah, that's not a word.

353
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,925
Okay, well,
we just wanted to bring you

354
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,294
some more cupcakes
for free, per usual,

355
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,364
and perhaps talk about
a possible business venture.

356
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,533
Oh, sorry, girls.

357
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,701
I have two rules in life:

358
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:51,372
Never drink
from the same well as a gypsy

359
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:54,892
and never lend money
to friends.

360
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,928
And, Max, you are my friend.

361
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,814
Okay, well, we were just
checking, but thanks anyway.

362
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,065
But, Sophie,
just hear us out.

363
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,716
It's a wonderful
opportunity,

364
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:04,235
and we'll of course
pay you back with interest.

365
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,154
Okay, buh-bye.

366
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:11,025
Let's go. We tried it.
Now it's--[Clucks]--time.

367
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,727
You are not harvesting
your body for money.

368
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,363
What's the big deal?

369
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:18,699
I sold two kidneys
for a down payment on my house.

370
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,202
Not true.
You need at least one to live.

371
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:25,590
Oh, well,
they weren't mine.

372
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,209
Well, you know
what we have to do.

373
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,595
Let's get the bawk
out of here.

374
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:39,960
And you're sure you're okay
with selling your eggs, right?

375
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:42,063
Totally. What do I care?
I've got a million of 'em.

376
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,431
I'm happy to lose a few.
More room for beer.

377
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,483
Lose some eggs,
more room for beer.

378
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:48,501
It's crazy
that's not their slogan.

379
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:50,587
So what'd they ask you
on the application?

380
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,288
You know, income, hobbies,

381
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,923
"Did you ever
have sex in Africa?"

382
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:56,426
[Scoffs]
I wish.

383
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,261
The closest I ever got
was a dude once

384
00:15:58,263 --> 00:16:01,231
put his hand up my skirt
in an Ethiopian restaurant.

385
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,149
You know,
now that we're here,

386
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,518
I think it's kind of wonderful
that places like this exist

387
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,071
to help women who can't have
babies have babies.

388
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:10,742
Hey, you think they
take points off for syphilis?

389
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:15,328
Max,
I think it's really noble

390
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,080
what you're doing
to get our dream.

391
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:18,615
This is a very special day.

392
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:21,317
How do you spell
"chlamydia"?

393
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,653
Well, no "k"s,

394
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:26,422
and I personally
wouldn't heart the "I."

395
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,124
Oh, thanks.

396
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:31,010
And do I gotta put here
if my brother touched a kid?

397
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,762
Max Black.

398
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:34,330
Thank you
for your interest,

399
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,798
but I'm afraid we're
gonna have to pass.

400
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,134
Why?
I didn't have sex in Africa.

401
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,853
Yes, I know,
that was your one plus,

402
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,388
but under "family history,"

403
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,108
you put "drinking"
and "secrets."

404
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,193
I was being honest.

405
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:50,563
Yeah, maybe too honest,
because under "education"

406
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,682
you wrote,
<i>"Jeopardy</i> reruns,"

407
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:55,118
and we're really
looking for college graduates.

408
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,188
Jeez, I'll take "elitist"
for 500, Alex.

409
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,124
Sorry,
we're looking for girls

410
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,959
that come
from Ivy league schools

411
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:05,295
and have impressive
family backgrounds.

412
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:07,363
Maybe her eggs
didn't go to Wharton

413
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,532
and graduate at the top
of their class like I did,

414
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,200
but just look at her.

415
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:14,170
Who wouldn't want a baby
with such strength, beauty,

416
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:17,540
and a rack so great
it could breast-feed itself?

417
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,559
You went to Wharton?

418
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:22,763
We pay $20,000
for Ivy league eggs.

419
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:27,850
[Clucks]

420
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:30,019
Wow, we're
taking blood already?

421
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:33,356
I guess going to Wharton
does put you on the fast track.

422
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:35,575
Just part of the process
to become a donor.

423
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:37,460
I'm gonna go get some vials,
and I'll be right back.

424
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:40,413
It's so cool of you
to do this.

425
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:41,614
It says a lot about you.

426
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,082
You know what says
a lot about me?

427
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,667
The fact that I know
she tied you off wrong.

428
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:46,753
I'm happy to do it.

429
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:50,423
It's a small price to pay
to make our dream come true.

430
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,458
I'm doin' this
to pay down some debt.

431
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,261
I'm real deep
'cause of Powerball.

432
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:57,347
Whoa, dude,
how did you get through?

433
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:01,551
I went to Harvard.
I'm like crazy-good at math.

434
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,936
Max, she's making me nervous.
Close the curtain.

435
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:05,755
And frankly,
I'm a little resentful.

436
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:07,440
I didn't get into Harvard.

437
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,258
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

438
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,110
- 'Cause you seem a little jumpy.
- No, I'm fine.

439
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:12,729
They're just taking
a little blood.

440
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,096
Or from the looks of it,

441
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:15,648
they're taking all of it.

442
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,900
There better be a nice juice
and a cookie after this.

443
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,537
Please relax.
It's only eight vials.

444
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,273
They gotta take a lot to
make sure they don't get a kid

445
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:26,560
with, like, another kid
growing out of it.

446
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:29,579
Max, this all
just got very real.

447
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,998
- Hold my hand.
- You know I don't hold hands.

448
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,251
Oh, you lesbians
are so high maintenance.

449
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:36,919
Please?

450
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,337
You don't think
I'm gonna give away

451
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,806
my best egg, right?

452
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:41,641
I'm not gonna give away
the concert pianist

453
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,309
and get stuck with the guy
who breaks into homes

454
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:44,927
and smells
women's underwear?

455
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,630
Well, either way,
you got a kid with a passion.

456
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:49,131
But you don't have
to do this.

457
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,184
No, I can do this.
It's for our dream.

458
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,468
But you don't have
to do this.

459
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,703
I can do this.
Put it in.

460
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:54,970
It's already in.

461
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,672
I can't do this.

462
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:59,742
I'm not trashy,
I'm not some farm animal.

463
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,828
Oh! Oh, my God!

464
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:06,999
Oh, my God.

465
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,585
I am so, so sorry!

466
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,320
You know
what would be cute here?

467
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,372
A cupcake store.

468
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:21,998
Hi, Max.
Oh, it's chilly outside.

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,668
Nipples everywhere.

470
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,437
Have a seat.
I'll be right over.

471
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:31,224
Oh, that's okay.
I texted my order in on the way.

472
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:35,194
Hey, baby. I got your text.
Did you get my erotic haiku?

473
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,846
I did.

474
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:39,348
Did you get the picture I sent
of me and the dustbuster?

475
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,819
No, I didn't.

476
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:47,073
Oh, no, Grandpa Yorgish!

477
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,358
Look.

478
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,793
Earl framed our blurb.

479
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:55,364
- He did? That is so sweet.
- What?

480
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:59,201
I always saw it as bigger
on the wall in our shop.

481
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:02,004
Look, the shop
is an amazing idea,

482
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:03,422
and, if it's not
that space right now,

483
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:04,674
it'll be another.

484
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,092
I mean, there have to be
mass murders

485
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,710
all over Brooklyn, right?

486
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,313
If we're lucky.

487
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:12,148
And, even
if it didn't work out,

488
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,900
it's still the closest
I've ever come

489
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:16,051
to something great,
and that's cool.

490
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:19,739
And someday we'll find someone
crazy enough to lend us money.

491
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:22,108
I say that because, if you can
convince me to believe a dream,

492
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,109
you can get anyone.

493
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:25,111
Pickup.
[Rings bell]

494
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:28,364
Here you go, Sophie.
That's $11.25.

495
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:29,967
Oh, you take a check, right?

496
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:33,669
This is for $20,000.

497
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:37,123
Oh, is it?
I thought it was for $20.

498
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,009
Oh, well. Keep it.

499
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,845
Maybe you could use it
for your dream,

500
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,765
or to get your legs waxed,
or something.

501
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,551
- Sophie, are you serious?
- Yes.

502
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:51,103
Sophie, this is really,
really amazing.

503
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:54,023
Oh, come on.
I don't need a parade.

504
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,309
Just keep
the cupcakes coming.

505
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,147
Max, do you know
what this means?

506
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:04,099
We are going to be
a Williamsburg must-have.

507
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:06,202
We're getting our dream.

508
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:08,321
I feel like you want
a hug.

509
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:11,123
I do.

510
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:22,323
