1
00:00:01,038 --> 00:00:02,439
Mm!

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:04,156
I like the lemon.

3
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:05,425
So good.

4
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:06,892
And with
the vanilla frosting,

5
00:00:06,894 --> 00:00:09,529
it would make a lovely
cupcake wedding cake.

6
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,830
Mm.

7
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,366
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

8
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:15,334
The chocolate!

9
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:18,002
You do realize
you're not alone, right?

10
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:19,622
I know.
I'm gonna get some water,

11
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:21,874
and then I'll be back
to taste <i>everything!</i>

12
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:27,011
There's no wedding.

13
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:29,081
- What?
- It's a scam.

14
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,299
I know her game.

15
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,185
There isn't a Denny's
on the Eastern Seaboard

16
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:33,753
I haven't hit up
and said it's my birthday

17
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:36,556
for a free sundae.

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:37,640
Well, what if you're wrong,

19
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,058
and she is the real deal?

20
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,093
A cupcake wedding cake
could be a lot of money.

21
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:42,228
We have to crack her B.S.

22
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,147
Before she eats our cupcakes,
and then <i>us.</i>

23
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,598
Follow my lead.

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,767
Oh! What are we tasting now?

25
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:49,035
Coconut.

26
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:51,237
- What's your fiance's name?
- Doug Franklin.

27
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,705
- Where'd you meet?
- He's a fireman.

28
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:54,490
- He rescued my cat.
- Aw.

29
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:57,825
No "aw."
That's an insurance commercial.

30
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:00,363
- So where's the wedding?
- Barefoot on the beach.

31
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:02,615
That's a tampon commercial.

32
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:04,167
Ooh! Hi, baby!

33
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:08,588
Max, you're wrong.
They're kissing.

34
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,090
Nope, he's either
an out-of-work actor she hired,

35
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:14,010
or he has cake in his mouth.

36
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:16,412
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

37
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,182

39
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:31,274
I have an announcement
to make.

40
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:34,111
You found your first
"down there" hair?

41
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,863
No, it's the last chance
to put in your business card

42
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,698
to win a luxury
weekend vacation.

43
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,266
It's Han's big promo.

44
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,135
Well, he's finally
announced it.

45
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,471
Han's a big promo.

46
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,407
Well, he's a little promo.

47
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,576
Good luck,
you now have a chance

48
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,945
to win a fancy two-room suite
in the country,

49
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,279
and there's a fireplace
because Daddy don't skimp.

50
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,651
Aw, I miss our fireplace
in the country.

51
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,186
My father and I
would sit together,

52
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,622
and I'd roast marshmallows,
and then he'd burn

53
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,956
what I now realize must've been
incriminating documents.

54
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,359
Hi, everybody!
The raffle girl is here.

55
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,465
Oh, I get to pull
the winner!

56
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,933
She pulled me twice today,

57
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,202
and I won both times.

58
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,438
Sophie, the way you
look tonight,

59
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,140
we are all winners.

60
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,376
Oh, Earl,
that is so sweet.

61
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,710
I would kiss you
if it was legal.

62
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,751
All right, I'm going
to put in one

63
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,154
of my cleaning company cards.

64
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,488
All right.

65
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,956
Who's gonna be the winner?

66
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:40,290
Yeah, yeah, shake it
like a Polaroid picture, baby.

67
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,629
Yeah.
Oh.

68
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,098
Oh, no, that doesn't feel
like my card.

69
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,100
Sophie, that's cheating.

70
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,434
Hey, keep out of it,
Glinda the good bitch.

71
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,238
And the winner is...

72
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,043
Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

73
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,612
Oh, my God!
We won!

74
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,147
Congratulations!

75
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,416
I've never won anything
in my life!

76
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,751
Except for that time
I got stoned

77
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,587
and accidentally won
that hot dog eating contest.

78
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,289
Wait, how
did this even happen?

79
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,356
Did you put our card in?

80
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,192
Actually,
I put your card in,

81
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,726
and I took a few out.

82
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,962
I figured you girls
could use a vacation.

83
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,163
You girls been working harder

84
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,099
than my liver
on payday.

85
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,835
Oh, Earl,
you're like Santa

86
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:25,169
without the weird fixation
on children.

87
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,474
It was so nice of Earl
to enter us.

88
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,808
Oh, stop.
He's like my father.

89
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,613
Wow, this place
actually looks nice.

90
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,782
Ooh, an outhouse!

91
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,851
- Max, that's a sauna.
- Oh.

92
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,220
Either way,
I'm peeing in it.

93
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,121
But Max,
can we leave the shop?

94
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,690
I mean, even though business
has been slow,

95
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,757
what if Dottie
wants to come back

96
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,125
and order cupcakes
for her wedding?

97
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,528
First off,
she ate them all.

98
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,096
Second, there
is no wedding.

99
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,664
She's a B.S. Bride.

100
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,899
I guarantee you,
right now,

101
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,667
she's crawling
through an air-conditioning vent

102
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,736
at a Krispy Kreme.

103
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,339
Andy in the house!

104
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,407
Sorry, I was watching
a <i>Living Single</i> marathon

105
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,710
before I came over.

106
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,378
You are not
gonna believe this.

107
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,946
We won a weekend getaway.

108
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,249
Isn't that exciting?
We really needed this.

109
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,817
That's great!

110
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,318
We do need this.
Thanks, babe.

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,053
And I was hoping to get
a little special one-on-one time

112
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,121
with you this weekend.

113
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,222
So when do we leave?

114
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,390
Oh, we!

115
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,825
We can leave tomorrow.

116
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,594
We--we--we
all the way there.

117
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,696
Look, Han said it
was a two-room suite.

118
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:24,731
Andy can come with us.

119
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,032
It's still our trip.

120
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,600
He doesn't have to know
he's the third wheel.

121
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,903
Well, you know
I'm always a fan of lying,

122
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,671
so I'm in.

123
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,139
It's still our trip.

124
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,808
She doesn't have to know
she's the third wheel.

125
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,343
Well, you know
I'm not a fan of lying,

126
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,179
but okay, I'm in.

127
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,289
I love a road trip.

128
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,790
My mom and I
took one in third grade

129
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,259
for, like, a year, but we'd
just drive around locally and--

130
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,563
Oh, my God,
I lived in a car.

131
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,665
Hey, let's play
a card game.

132
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,434
I spy something red.

133
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,369
Is it that gas station?

134
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,654
Nope.

135
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:05,189
- Is it that truck?
- Nope.

136
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,457
Is it boring? Yes!
My turn.

137
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,027
I spy something annoying.

138
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:11,328
- Is it me?
- Yes!

139
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,462
I knew the joke
was on me,

140
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,298
but I love to win.

141
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,333
You are not annoying.
You're adorable.

142
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,569
I spy a big man-gina.

143
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,003
- Is it me?
- Yes!

144
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,872
I like to win too.

145
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:26,176
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

146
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,644
Hello?

147
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,079
Bad cell area.

148
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,548
Max, I think that might've been
Dottie, the B.S. Bride.

149
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,583
I couldn't hear the words,

150
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:35,085
but she sounded
unnaturally confident.

151
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,821
Maybe the B.S.
stands for "big sale."

152
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,456
No more business calls,
okay?

153
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:40,824
I thought we
were getting away for fun.

154
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,359
We are, but our business

155
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,894
is nowhere near
where we need it to be,

156
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,262
and when it comes
to ignoring a call,

157
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:46,763
it's kind of hard.

158
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,566
Hey, you know what this area
of the mountains is known for?

159
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,135
Wineries and incest?

160
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,037
Alien abductions!

161
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,239
I know all about it.

162
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,074
People disappear from here
all the time.

163
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,543
Max, there's no such thing
as an extraterrestrial.

164
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:02,877
Okay, first, that's something
an extraterrestrial would say.

165
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,283
I've always wanted
to be abducted.

166
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,617
And my guidance counselor
said I had no goals.

167
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:12,823
And here we go.

168
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:14,224
Again,
I don't believe in names,

169
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,493
but feel free to call me
"Roger" if it helps you.

170
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:18,629
Get out!
<i>Get out!</i>

171
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,898
The bed floats!
This is awesome!

172
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,400
Usually, you gotta
bring the ropes to the bed.

173
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:26,303
This way, you get
to eliminate a whole step!

174
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,704
The bed's sculptural beauty

175
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:30,407
is actually surpassed
by the joy of resting in it.

176
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,175
Some say it's like
being rocked to sleep

177
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,977
in the arms of God.

178
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,613
It's a sex bed, Roger.

179
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,248
May I light the fire
for you?

180
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,650
Oh, no, thanks.
I can do it.

181
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,851
I was an Eagle Scout.

182
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,152
Man, there's just
not enough occasions

183
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,721
where I can brag
about that.

184
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,957
The room is cute,
but really tiny.

185
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,225
We're gonna need
a bigger space,

186
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:51,559
unless we're Hobbits.

187
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:53,297
Is this the door
to the adjoining room?

188
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:54,698
Well, that
is an adjoining room,

189
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,533
but it's not included
in your package.

190
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,668
Oh, damn it!

191
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,102
We should've known
Han's package

192
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:02,436
was gonna be smaller
than he said it is.

193
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,078
I'm sorry.
All the other cabins are booked.

194
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,247
I'll bring you some bedding
for the couch

195
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:13,016
at an additional price.

196
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,719
<i>Ohm Shanti.</i>

197
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,188
Well, I guess you guys

198
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,490
are the couple,
so I'll sleep on the couch.

199
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:21,658
I can sleep anywhere.

200
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:22,826
First two years
of my life,

201
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:26,160
my bed was a pile
of unopened mail.

202
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,631
A big, roaring fire

203
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:29,633
is gonna be so romantic.

204
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,068
Come over here
closer to me,

205
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,502
you big Eagle Scout.

206
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:35,836
Well, now you sound
like my Scoutmaster.

207
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,344
Hey, don't start anything
you can't finish in a minute.

208
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:41,745
Max'll be right out.

209
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:44,348
Something tells me she's
not a consistent hand-washer.

210
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:45,615
You do your thing.

211
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:46,817
I'm just
gonna sit right here,

212
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,986
and watch my man
build a fire.

213
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:50,654
Oh, great,
this is cedar!

214
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:51,888
It's gonna
smell so awesome.

215
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,391
I love falling asleep
to the sound of a fire.

216
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,759
Oh, my God.

217
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,893
I know,
no business stuff,

218
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,862
but I just got a text
about a big order.

219
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:00,597
That's fine,
just remember this weekend--

220
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:02,666
Oh, I know,
me and you.

221
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,669
Me and you,
me and you--

222
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,504
Max! Max.

223
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:09,506
Turns out the B.S. Bride
isn't B.S.

224
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,375
She wants pricing
on a wedding cupcake cake,

225
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,744
and a groom's cupcake cake,
for 300 guests.

226
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:14,978
Great!

227
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:18,312
Almost as great
as these little fuzzy shoes!

228
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,350
They were
in a sealed plastic package.

229
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,386
I'm the first one
to ever open them.

230
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:25,720
They're like condoms
for your feet!

231
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,458
♪ New shoes, new shoes ♪

232
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,526
Where are you going?

233
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,727
To the sauna.

234
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,295
Hopefully, I'll be abducted
on my way,

235
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,563
but know
that even though I'm gone,

236
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm happier up there
with my alien lover.

237
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,035
True, they don't have lips,

238
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:40,971
but they
do have crazy-long fingers.

239
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:42,339
I'll go with you.

240
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,607
Not to talk about work,

241
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,776
but she can't go alone.
There might be bears.

242
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:47,811
There were always bears
at my chalet in Aspen,

243
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:50,313
in the woods,
lying on the floors, everywhere.

244
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,647
You know, until PETA
attacked the house.

245
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,453
So this is a fancy sauna?

246
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,554
Not impressed.

247
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,189
People pay
for the privilege

248
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,192
of sitting in decades
of ass sweat?

249
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,794
How come your towel's
staying up

250
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,962
so much better
than mine?

251
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,732
I can think
of two reasons.

252
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,734
I'm gonna get some water,
and then start peeing.

253
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:12,035
When you come back,
we have to discuss

254
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:13,270
the B.S. Bride's cake.

255
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,439
We can't screw this up.
It's all we have.

256
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,141
This heat is amazing.

257
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,777
Mother of God!
That's hot.

258
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:22,479
There are bears out there.

259
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,980
- They're coming this way.
- What?

260
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,083
Max, get in here!
Close the door!

261
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,652
Fine, but they'll just open it
and come in.

262
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,321
Bears can't open doors
and walk in.

263
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,655
These ones can.

264
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:37,594
Hey, girls.
You mind if we join you?

265
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:38,895
You guys
are gay bears, right?

266
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,697
- Max!
- It's cool.

267
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:42,466
My prom date is big
in the bear scene now,

268
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,867
but in high school,
they just called him a jock

269
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:44,901
who cried sometimes.

270
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,139
Yep, we're bears.
Big, hairy,<i> not </i>scary.

271
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,075
I'm Deke.
This is Dirk.

272
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:53,844
Yup, we're Deke and Dirk.

273
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,046
Pause for reaction.

274
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,614
I'm Caroline,
and this is Max.

275
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:59,683
Are you girls
lipstick lesbians?

276
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,685
No, we're just friends,

277
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,153
and we can't
afford lipstick.

278
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:04,788
Especially at this gift shop.

279
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:05,789
Have you seen the prices?

280
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,357
$25 for chap stick?

281
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,126
Please.
No one's lips are that chapped.

282
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:11,561
And he would know.

283
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:13,630
This one's the king
of face creaming.

284
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,867
A little bit dirtier
than what it is.

285
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,169
I'm actually a dermatologist.

286
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,170
Oh, my God.

287
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,304
Do not tell me
I'm lucky enough

288
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,173
to be in a sauna
with two dermatologists.

289
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:24,274
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

290
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,408
I'm an astrophysicist.

291
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,677
Oh, smarter
than the average bear.

292
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:30,447
- Loving her.
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,016
So you know about
space stuff, smarty bear.

294
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,351
Do you believe in aliens?

295
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:37,187
Oh, I do, and I believe
they're living among us.

296
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:40,390
I'm looking at you,
Christina Ricci!

297
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,125
So talk to me, Deke.
What can you give me?

298
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:45,028
He has <i>plenty</i> of free cream samples
back in our room.

299
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,663
And it's the good stuff.
You should come by!

300
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,731
We're in cabin four.

301
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,166
No way!
We're in cabin three.

302
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,002
Ah!

303
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,570
How about those rope beds?

304
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,805
You know it's kinky
when the bed is already tied up.

305
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,976
First, we were all
"um, we're gonna fall,"

306
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:01,011
but then we thought,
"what the hell?

307
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:02,312
It's our man-iversary."

308
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,513
Aw, you're married?

309
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:05,182
Happy anniversary.

310
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,217
Now, let's get back
to those free creams.

311
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:08,418
Oh, and here's our card

312
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,419
if you're ever
in the neighborhood

313
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,854
or need a big order.

314
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:13,089
You brought a business card
to a sauna?

315
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,158
I don't wanna know
where you kept that.

316
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,826
- Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
- Mm.

317
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,662
Or in your case,
cub-cakes.

318
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:21,998
- Loving her.
- Living for her.

319
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,099
Wanna come back as her.

320
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,146
There you go,
your dinner for two.

321
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:35,214
Two soups, two salads,
two entrees, two desserts.

322
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,434
I hope you three enjoy.

323
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:40,269
Maybe could we
order another meal?

324
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,771
No problem,
just call.

325
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:43,506
Extra charge,
of course.

326
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,008
<i>Ohm Shanti.</i>

327
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,044
<i>Ohm Shanti</i> means "screw you"
in yoga, right?

328
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,246
I am so starving.

329
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,148
Oh, my God,
this looks amazing!

330
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,083
Oh, and the bread
is still warm!

331
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:56,919
And there's one of those
crazy-ass pretzel rolls.

332
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,488
Is it a pretzel?
Is it a roll?

333
00:11:58,489 --> 00:11:59,822
No idea, it's crazy.

334
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,358
Max, put some
of this butter on it.

335
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,694
Try and stop me, bitch!

336
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:06,663
Here, take half.
Thanks!

337
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,164
Mm.

338
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:09,432
Yo.

339
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:11,934
Oh, my God, Andy!
I totally forgot.

340
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:14,303
Not about you.
I forgot my manners.

341
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:15,705
If my Danish governess
were here,

342
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:18,107
she would hit me
with her wooden spoon.

343
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,208
I'm so sorry.

344
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,777
Go, sit.
You eat.

345
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:22,045
Enjoy the pretzel roll.

346
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,747
It's gone.
You snooze, you lose.

347
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:25,748
No, you sit.
I'm good.

348
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:26,849
I'll order more food.

349
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,084
No, sit!
Sit.

350
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,687
I'm the bad one.

351
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,955
This soup is "duh-mazing."

352
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:34,390
Just a word I made up

353
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,025
for when something's
so amazing, you're stunned,

354
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,727
and all you can say
is "duh."

355
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:39,462
Duh-mazing.

356
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,731
Yes, I'd like
to order anoth--

357
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:44,100
Yes, I'll hold.

358
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:47,434
I think the hold music
is just Roger singing.

359
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:48,905
Okay, hang up the phone.

360
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,373
Go sit and eat.
Come on.

361
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:51,941
Hurry before Max
eats the table.

362
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:53,910
No, you eat.

363
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:55,712
After all,
it's our special weekend.

364
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:57,080
I want you to enjoy it.

365
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:58,214
Well, okay,

366
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:00,016
but only because
it's a special occasion.

367
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:01,084
Good!

368
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,285
I'm gonna go take
a hot shower.

369
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:03,586
Besides, it's always better
to make love

370
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:04,854
on an empty stomach.

371
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:08,188
That must be why there
are so many people in India.

372
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,793
Max, I got a favor
to ask you.

373
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:12,628
Do you think you can go visit
your bear friends next door,

374
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,363
maybe give us
some private time?

375
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:17,233
It'll be your birthday gift
to me.

376
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,735
Oh!

377
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:21,304
It would be
my birthday gift to you

378
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:22,739
because it's your birthday.

379
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,874
Yeah, just
for, like, two hours.

380
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,142
Okay, one hour.

381
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,410
I'll skip the foreplay,

382
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,978
and that'll be
my birthday gift to myself.

383
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:33,516
Cool, then I'll just
go do that, then.

384
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,351
I mean, Caroline
went to all this trouble

385
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,386
to get you a trip
for your birthday, I assume.

386
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:38,654
I know,

387
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,690
and I was really looking forward
to some birthday sex

388
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,458
since we haven't really
connected that way

389
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,694
since the shop started
giving you guys so much trouble.

390
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:46,863
But the shop's been
in trouble for weeks.

391
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:50,197
Yeah, so maybe I'll only need,
like, a half hour with her.

392
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,869
I need my book.
I'm gonna take a bath instead.

393
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,637
That tub is <i>so</i> amazing.

394
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:55,772
I'm just
gonna soak in it

395
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,774
and blissfully
forget all my problems.

396
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,809
As well
as some other things.

397
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,811
Max is gonna go visit
Yogi and Boo Boo next door

398
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,279
and give us some private time.

399
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
She can't do that.

400
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,581
It's their man-iversary.

401
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,049
They need their private time.

402
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,985
Yes, but you guys

403
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:11,888
are celebrating
a special thing, too.

404
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,790
What?
What are we celebrating?

405
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,825
Andy's birthday.
Oh, damn it!

406
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,594
Now, I went and spoiled
all the special sexual things

407
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:21,430
you had planned for him.

408
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,032
Damn it, Max!

409
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:25,134
Now, you <i>did</i>
give it all away.

410
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:27,470
We were gonna do missionary,

411
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,004
and...

412
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,504
...the other one.

413
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,412
Okay.

414
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,047
Okay, I'm sorry.
I forgot.

415
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:40,750
I don't know how.
I <i>knew</i> today was your birthday.

416
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,152
It's tomorrow.

417
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:44,654
So yippee!

418
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:45,888
She hasn't missed it.

419
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,223
All's right with the world.

420
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:51,227
I'm gonna go visit
the berenstains.

421
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,629
This weekend wasn't
about my birthday, was it?

422
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,765
Come on, come on.

423
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:57,233
Get your hand out
of his honeypot

424
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:00,102
and get over here.

425
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,404
I'll be gone
in a second,

426
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:04,307
and then you guys can
jump-start your sex life again.

427
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:06,676
What do you mean
"jump-start"?

428
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,044
How could you tell Max

429
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:09,245
that we haven't had sex?

430
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:11,047
You haven't even
discussed that with me.

431
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,215
Come on, aliens.

432
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,950
If you're ever going
to abduct me,

433
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:15,852
this would be the time.

434
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:17,386
Don't take the attention
off the fact

435
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:20,389
that you
forgot my birthday.

436
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,191
Oh, God,
I wish I was a cartoon,

437
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,526
so I could run
right through this door,

438
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,860
and leave behind
a body-shaped hole.

439
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,130
- Oh, hey, Max.
- Hey.

440
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,131
Mind if I hibernate
for a minute?

441
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:30,433
Oh, sure,
come on in.

442
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,335
We were just gonna eat
and then dye our chest hair.

443
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,806
Close that damn door now.

444
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,574
Thanks, it was just getting
a little tense in there.

445
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,010
- She forgot his birthday.
- Mm, ouch.

446
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,311
Well, he forgot mine once,

447
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,981
and now
it's his ankle tattoo.

448
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:46,682
Max, please,
I insist.

449
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:47,850
You don't have
to ask me twice.

450
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,986
You gonna
eat the pretzel roll?

451
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,221
Andy, I'm sorry
about your birthday.

452
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:53,589
It just went out
of my head.

453
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,757
I feel bad.

454
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:55,758
And I feel sick.

455
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,426
Can you stop swinging the bed?

456
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:59,428
Sorry, I'm nervous.

457
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:00,963
Yeah,
you're nervous a lot,

458
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,266
which is why our other bed
isn't moving at all.

459
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,333
No, no, no, no, no,
don't go.

460
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,535
Come back.
Come back to the sex bed.

461
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:07,803
Let's get some sex going!

462
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:10,439
Come on! We can
get this bed moving now!

463
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
See!

464
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,209
See?

465
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,045
Hey! Oh, hi!

466
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:18,881
Oh, it's your birthday!
It's your birthday!

467
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:20,449
It's tomorrow.

468
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,051
Okay.
Okay.

469
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,552
I can do better, see?

470
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:25,021
Here we go!

471
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:26,822
Now, here we go!

472
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:30,156
Wanna see me twerk it?
Oh!

473
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:35,164
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

474
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,066
If I'd had any food,
I would throw up.

475
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,534
Okay, yeah,
have a seat.

476
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,236
Let's have some bread.

477
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,674
Has it really been that long
since we had sex?

478
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,008
Sweetie,
after that dance,

479
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:49,342
it's hard to believe
you've ever had sex.

480
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,781
It hasn't
been <i>that</i> long.

481
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:52,982
The shop opened
on the 12th,

482
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:55,251
so it's...

483
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:57,019
What?

484
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,287
No,
it's just interesting

485
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,489
you had no problem
remembering that date.

486
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,458
Let me ask you a question.

487
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,060
Where do you think
you're going?

488
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:05,294
What do you mean?
I'm here.

489
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:06,529
No.

490
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,763
Where do you think
you're going?

491
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:09,999
Like, where do you see
your life in a year?

492
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,734
Well, pretty soon,
Max and I

493
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:12,969
will be out
of this rough patch,

494
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,136
and full force
with the business,

495
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,671
doing weddings
and big events,

496
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:18,007
and then Max and I will
probably open another store,

497
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:19,075
get a bigger apartment.

498
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:22,011
Okay, and am I
in there somewhere?

499
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,447
Oh, come on.
I was getting to you.

500
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:25,648
Were you?

501
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,217
When? When were you
getting to me?

502
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:30,886
After your business
is a success?

503
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,088
No! Now.

504
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,091
Come on.
Sex time in the sex bed.

505
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,262
Wanna do it
on the floor?

506
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,032
This is so comfortable!

507
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,238
You put a belt on this,
you could wear it out.

508
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:52,174
Just don't try that
at your in-laws' house

509
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:54,176
with a matching turban.

510
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,879
Dirk, my father
worked 40 years in the factory

511
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,247
before he lost his arm.

512
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,416
- He doesn't get "camp."
- Okay.

513
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,417
Now get up here, lady.

514
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:02,585
We're having cookies and milk.

515
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,387
You guys rock.

516
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:06,655
I promise I won't
stay here all night.

517
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:07,890
Don't wanna get trapped
in the middle

518
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,725
of your country bear jamboree.

519
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:12,528
Please, honey.

520
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,330
You are perfectly safe
in this bed.

521
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:17,066
We haven't had sex
in a year.

522
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,834
Why would you
tell her that?

523
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,536
Well, she told us about
her friends not having sex.

524
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:21,971
I thought it
was on the table.

525
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,006
But <i>we</i> haven't even
discussed that.

526
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,340
Mother ship,
make it happen!

527
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,811
This is the time
to abduct me.

528
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:35,484
Hi. Max, you can come back.
Andy left.

529
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,086
He said he'd find
his own way home.

530
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,420
- He left?
- Because you're not having sex?

531
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:43,325
Max, you told the bears
we're not having sex?

532
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:44,493
Why would you share that?

533
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,795
Exactly, Caroline.

534
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:47,530
And why would you
tell Max that,

535
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:49,765
when you never even brought
it up in our Gestalt therapy?

536
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:52,535
I was planning on addressing
it with you this weekend.

537
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,637
You think I'd spend $500
on this room

538
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:55,938
for milk and cookies?

539
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,740
I think
we're all forgetting

540
00:18:57,741 --> 00:18:59,809
how good that soup was.

541
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,077
Well, I'm sorry
if I haven't been feeling

542
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:02,278
very attractive lately.

543
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,780
I tell you how handsome
you are every day.

544
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:08,114
Don't you guys
look exactly alike?

545
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,653
Are you okay?

546
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:11,987
I'm all right.

547
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,156
You wanna get in bed
and cuddle for a little while?

548
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:15,758
No, it's--
yeah.

549
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,326
Come on.
Yeah, get in here.

550
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,595
There you go.
There you go.

551
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:21,664
Whoo!

552
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,700
Oh, good.
You're alive.

553
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:26,335
When I heard you left
and walked through the woods,

554
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:29,669
I wondered,
"was there anal probing?"

555
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,209
By an alien,
not a grifter.

556
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,543
You texted you wanted
to see me?

557
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:37,313
Well, someone did.

558
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,848
Happy Birthday!

559
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,015
Now, come on, blow.

560
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:41,617
I don't really
feel like doing that.

561
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:44,820
Welcome to our world.

562
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,058
Andy, I'm so sorry
about everything.

563
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,192
It's okay.

564
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:51,961
I had a lot of time
to think on the bus,

565
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,796
and the other bus,
and the bus I had to take

566
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,431
when that bus broke down.

567
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:56,665
If it makes you
feel any better,

568
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,835
I have rope burns
all down my back.

569
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:02,505
Andy, I'm sorry
about your birthday.

570
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,006
We told each other
those dates a month ago.

571
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,975
I wouldn't expect you
to remember mine.

572
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,776
May 28th, 1987.

573
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:09,478
10:30 in the morning.

574
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,812
10:30 at night,
so you're not perfect.

575
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,451
Look, you have
a really busy life,

576
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:18,020
and you're really ambitious,
which I admire,

577
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:20,589
but I wanna be more than someone
you get to eventually.

578
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,957
And you deserve that.

579
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,126
It's just I have to put
the business first right now--

580
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,294
And I get that.

581
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:28,628
I just--I think we
should take a break.

582
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:30,299
You wanna
take a break?

583
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,369
Maybe, yeah.

584
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,570
Are you saying
take a break

585
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:35,638
'cause you really
mean "break up,"

586
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,206
but you're trying
to be nice?

587
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:39,808
Maybe, yeah.

588
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:40,943
I'm sorry if this
seems sudden,

589
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:42,278
but I know me,

590
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,713
and maybe it's better sooner
than later.

591
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:46,482
I'm back!

592
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:48,050
And I brought my bridesmaids!

593
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:52,688
Looks like business
is picking up.

594
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,657
It's gonna be hard
not to see you.

595
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,525
Yeah, it will be.

596
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,961
I work 10 feet away.

597
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:00,129
This way, ladies.

598
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,831
We're gonna taste
every cupcake they have!

599
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:05,534
This is the time
to take me!

600
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,835
Come on, final offer!

601
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,871
E.T.? Alf?

602
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:11,006
Christina Ricci?

603
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:19,847
