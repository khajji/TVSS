1
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,828
Max, look,
the mailman came.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,279
Where am I looking,
your chest, yo hair?

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:08,214
Gimme a hint.

4
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:13,420
It's here.
Our eviction notice.

5
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:14,588
It's amazing you can send

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,124
this much shame
for just 46 cents.

7
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,876
What, you miss three out of
six months and you're out?

8
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,511
We're batting .500.

9
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,430
That's hall of fame stuff
right there.

10
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:25,182
Hi, girls.

11
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,567
I just stopped by
to get a cupcake

12
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,635
to eat on the way
to the gym.

13
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:30,854
Here, have a seat.

14
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,239
I'll get you your usual.

15
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,608
Max, where are
the lemon meringue cupcakes?

16
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,943
Stopped making 'em.

17
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:37,077
And the fudge berries

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,278
and the purple velvets.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,830
We have so many
left over every day

20
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,815
that even the homeless lady
I give them to at night

21
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:45,150
was like, "Girl, your shop
in trouble, ain't it?"

22
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:46,704
So what, Max?

23
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,288
You think we should
take business advice

24
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,090
from a woman who thinks
our nation's currency

25
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,509
should be the McNugget?

26
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,545
She makes a good point.

27
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,997
Uhoh.

28
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:00,134
I think it's getting a little
too real in here for me.

29
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:03,469
I'm gonna go push up my boobs
and glue my tooth back on.

30
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,975
Seriously, what
are we gonna do about this?

31
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:10,394
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

32
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:13,513
Aww, you ripped up
an eviction notice.

33
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,848
That's the one thing my mother
and I used to do together.

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,137
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

35
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:24,740
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

37
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,182
Max, I know
our shop's in trouble.

38
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,517
It's all I think about.

39
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,885
Even in my sexual fantasies,

40
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:41,220
I'm giving Ryan Gosling
a rent check.

41
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:45,057
I just wish we had a sign
that told us what to do.

42
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:47,360
See? Customers.

43
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:48,562
That's a sign to stay open.

44
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:50,113
Here, pretend to be busy.

45
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:51,982
We'll send those
right out.

46
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:55,317
Thank you for calling,
Oprah.

47
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,705
Hi, I'm Joanne Morse.

48
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:02,040
I wish I was rich enough
to have somedy talk for me.

49
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,628
Max, are you blind?
She's deaf.

50
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,880
Oh. So cool.

51
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:09,966
I've wanted to be deaf
ever since she moved in.

52
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:13,203
I'm a representative from
Tenner Commercial Real Estate.

53
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,888
We're acquiring
this property

54
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,174
and would like to offer you
a corporate buy out.

55
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:20,509
I understood that better
when she said it.

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,513
Thank you very much,
but we're not interested.

57
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,883
I speak
a little sign language.

58
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,384
You just said
"Thank you very much,

59
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:31,554
but I'm not
wearing underwear."

60
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:34,825
I knew that tutor
was screwing with me.

61
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:38,160
And I'm the one
not wearing underwear.

62
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:44,381
We're ready to offer you
$25,000 to take over your lease.

63
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,753
Hell yes, bitch.

64
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:48,455
Max, no.
What are you doing?

65
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:49,906
This shop is our dream.

66
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,242
Well, our dream
is turning into a nightmare

67
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:55,095
and no one's coming
to wake us up.

68
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:56,880
This is our future.

69
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:59,432
I'm sorry, thank you very much,
but we're gonna pass.

70
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:02,102
Our business is booming.

71
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:04,437
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,256
Look at him.

73
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,974
Yeah.

74
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:10,260
Come on and vogue.

75
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,611
Yes.

76
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:14,614
Yeah, dance to the music.

77
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:17,267
Yeah.

78
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,602
Remember when Madonna
was alive?

79
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:25,457
Those were
the good old days.

80
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:28,161
We'll give you some time
to think about it,

81
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,946
but with your
delinquent rent history,

82
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:33,216
if you stay, we would need
six months' rent up front.

83
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:36,119
So I'd take the $25,000.

84
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,304
It's a good deal.

85
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,056
$25,000?

86
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:42,309
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

87
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:45,644
Uh, uh, we... call... you.

88
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,647
Okay?

89
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:50,850
Yeah.

90
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:56,690
Sophie,
it's none of your business.

91
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:58,325
This is our decision.

92
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,611
You said you
were looking for a sign.

93
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:04,946
What's more of a sign
than sign language?

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
No.
End of story.

95
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:08,785
I would not sell this shop

96
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,404
for all the McNuggets
in the world.

97
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,956
I still believe in our dream,

98
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,324
and it does not end
with an offer

99
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,659
from the def real estate jam.

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,013
Women. Am I right?

101
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,686
Earl, I need some advice.

102
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,138
Caroline and I
were offered money

103
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,689
to buy out
the cupcake store,

104
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:33,024
and as my spirit animal,
Kenny Rogers, once asked,

105
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:36,561
"When do you hold 'em
and when do you fold 'em?"

106
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:39,866
Well, Max, there
are two things in life

107
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:43,019
you've got to hold on to:
Your dreams,

108
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:46,354
and your receipt
when you're leaving Best Buy.

109
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:50,775
Oh, you do not want to be
a black man without a receipt.

110
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,796
Mm-mm.

111
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,799
- Hey.
- Hey.

112
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:57,700
Max, did you just give me
the cold shoulder?

113
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:59,719
Oh, my God, I've been doing
that for a year and a half

114
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,221
and you finally got it.

115
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:04,374
I'm sorry
for storming out earlier,

116
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:06,426
but we just can't give it up
that easy.

117
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,761
I can, and have,
and will again.

118
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,932
Maybe it's better
if we just get out now.

119
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:14,217
I heard a customer saying

120
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,069
a Whole Foods
is going in over there.

121
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:17,520
You know who goes
to Whole Foods?

122
00:05:17,522 --> 00:05:20,855
Rich ladies with
those freaky toe sneakers.

123
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:25,276
And I cannot be seeing
no freaky toe sneakers.

124
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,747
Whole Foods?

125
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:30,033
That's the sign
I've been looking for.

126
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:31,334
No wonder they wanted
to get rid of us.

127
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:32,585
With a Whole Foods there,

128
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:34,120
they can raise
everybody's rent.

129
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:37,257
That's fine,
we don't pay it anyway.

130
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,626
I knew it was gonna be
the hot new neighborhood.

131
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:41,211
I knew it!
This is it, Max.

132
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,246
First comes the Whole Foods,
then come the gays,

133
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,297
then the celebrities.

134
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,515
Well, the gays
will come anyway

135
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:48,385
as long as there's a park.

136
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:50,887
Seriously, Max,
it's just a matter of time

137
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,522
before we're telling
Anne Hathaway,

138
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,923
"Forget that fake smile

139
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,276
and just go wait in line
like everybody else."

140
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,445
Han, they're opening up
a Whole Foods

141
00:05:58,447 --> 00:05:59,946
right near
our cupcake shop.

142
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,081
Another Whole Foods?

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,781
They won't be happy till it's
"Whole Country," am I right?

144
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:09,239
I saw that on a meme.

145
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,074
Now we have to stay
in that neighborhood.

146
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:14,127
We just have to come up with
six months rent up front.

147
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,745
Well, I'd love
to help you, ladies,

148
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:19,080
but I forgot my PIN number
in 2008.

149
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,551
Wait a minute,
2008.

150
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:24,886
That's my PIN number!

151
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:32,312
You want my money?

152
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:34,764
Ehr mah gerd.

153
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,983
I've been looking at
a lot of memes.

154
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:39,319
Oh, that's
who you look like.

155
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,654
Grumpy cat!

156
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:46,474
Max, I know we've borrowed
from everyone we know,

157
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:48,478
but I'm so convinced
that this is the right thing

158
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,864
that I'm willing
to stoop to something

159
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,815
I never thought I'd do.

160
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,251
Look, you're sweet
and you're adorable,

161
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,586
but you're way too bony to
bring in more than 40 a night.

162
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:01,991
And even if you got
an animal sidekick,

163
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,294
it's still not
gonna get us there.

164
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:07,629
It would get me there.

165
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:10,833
We can make an appointment,
go into the city,

166
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,385
and ask my aunt Charity
for the money.

167
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:14,170
She's president
of a cosmetic empire

168
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,688
and she's filthy rich.

169
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,525
And how is she
literally the only thing

170
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,560
you've never talked about?

171
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:22,896
Because she hates me.

172
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,814
That's what family is.

173
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:27,016
People who hate you,
but can't kill you

174
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:30,351
'cause they're
the first ones questioned.

175
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,946
I'm surprised
you're still waiting.

176
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:42,966
Most people leave
after two hours.

177
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:44,851
Well, it's not
a problem for us.

178
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:47,186
We'll wait two hours,
three, a whole day.

179
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:49,039
That sounds about right.

180
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:51,925
Stephanie.

181
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,410
Coming.

182
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:55,413
That's not my name,

183
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,748
but I'm afraid to tell her.

184
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:04,337
So why doesn't
your aunt like you?

185
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,123
I don't know.
She just doesn't like me.

186
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,008
For example,
one time, when I was ten,

187
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,560
and we were at
our Hamptons beach house--

188
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:13,396
I already don't like you.

189
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:16,731
I wanted my night-night cocoa
in my special seagull mug--

190
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,718
Now I hate you.

191
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,520
And my aunt Charity,
who was babysitting

192
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:21,688
because everybody else
was in Europe

193
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,222
at the dressage
competition...

194
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:26,025
Now I've beat you up
and left you for dead.

195
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,528
Told me my seagull cup
was broken

196
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,062
and I knew it wasn't.

197
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:31,448
And when
I wouldn't stop crying,

198
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,832
she locked me in my bedroom,

199
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,233
and when the servants
weren't looking,

200
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:35,952
pulled my hair.

201
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:39,287
Love her.

202
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:42,509
You can go in now.

203
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:44,377
It's not that big
a deal, Kevin.

204
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,929
We're launching
a lipstick at Target,

205
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,047
not a missile at Iran.

206
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,632
Aunt Charity, hi.

207
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,084
Caroline,
look at you.

208
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,938
Gorgeous, beautiful.
You stuck with that nose.

209
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,807
Good for you.

210
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,559
And who's this
with the great lips?

211
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:00,927
Aunt Charity,
this is my friend

212
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:02,479
and business partner,
Max.

213
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,030
Nice to meet you.

214
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,899
Did she tell you
I pulled her hair?

215
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:08,568
Oh, it was legend
around the family townhouse.

216
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,036
My brother
came into my room.

217
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:11,771
"Did you pull
my princess's hair?

218
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:13,206
She said
you pulled her hair."

219
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,492
I mean, come on.
She's 10, I'm 23.

220
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:17,460
What, I'm just gonna reach up
and pull her hair?

221
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:18,912
I mean,
how would that happen?

222
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:21,280
Ow.

223
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:23,082
I mean, who would
just pull a child's hair?

224
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,634
Ow.

225
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,136
I mean, come on.
I'm gonna pull her hair?

226
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:27,220
- Ow.
- Pull her hair?

227
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:28,454
- Ow! Ow!
- Pull her hair?

228
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,672
Ow! Okay,
you just pulled my hair.

229
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,007
Oh, my God,
here we go again.

230
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,976
Get the lawyers.

231
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,227
Come on, have a seat.

232
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:35,345
Have a seat
in the big girl chair.

233
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:38,581
You're a big girl now.

234
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,084
Aunt Charity, thank you
so much for seeing us.

235
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,685
I know your time
is very valuable.

236
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,687
I have all the time
in the world for you.

237
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:46,356
You're family.

238
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:48,358
Stephanie, I'm not
doing anything important.

239
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,944
Bring me those documents
to sign.

240
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:53,780
I haven't seen
this one since I was 25

241
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,365
and my parents cut me off.

242
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,916
You sleep with
one Pakistani lesbian,

243
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:59,118
you're out
of the family.

244
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,837
Here, you with the big lips,
try these.

245
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,338
Tell me which ones you hate.

246
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,824
Aunt Charity started
her makeup empire at 26

247
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,960
when she invented
bubblegum-flavored lip gloss.

248
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:08,845
Oh, my God,
that was you?

249
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,296
I loved that.

250
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:11,998
I was wearing that
during my first kiss.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,333
And thank you, because
I got an "A" in that class.

252
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,638
Every girl who loves
lipstick loves me,

253
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,607
except for this one,
who hates me

254
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,443
Because I was so mean

255
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:26,178
and I broke
her night-night cocoa cup.

256
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,015
Aunt Charity,
I never said you were mean.

257
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:30,984
I was ten, and I just
got a little confused

258
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:32,535
about what happened
to my seagull cup.

259
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:33,686
But I'm an adult now.

260
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:35,071
When I go night-night,

261
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,856
I barely even think
about that cocoa cup.

262
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:39,125
Caroline, I was 23.

263
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,027
I don't remember
anything about a cup.

264
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:42,328
All I remember
about that weekend

265
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,546
was that Versace
was murdered

266
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:46,332
and my dress
would obviously be late.

267
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,551
Now, why are you here?

268
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:51,087
Tell me. You have my full
and undivided attention.

269
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,922
Where and where?

270
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:55,508
Well, Aunt Charity,
as you may or may not know,

271
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,393
I now have
a start-up business.

272
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:00,728
Hey, is it me, or does
this look like a dog penis?

273
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,684
She's fun.
Seems professional.

274
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,552
Good choice.

275
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:08,054
And, as you know,

276
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:10,222
I've always respected
your business acumen.

277
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,358
- Even when I was a little--
- How much?

278
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,060
Fine, businesswoman
to businesswoman--

279
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,579
I need a number.
Give me a number.

280
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:18,031
25,000.

281
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:21,034
And all these lipsticks,

282
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:24,369
including dog penis.

283
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:26,372
And I'm not asking
for a handout.

284
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:29,125
- This is a business opportunity.
- No.

285
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,427
Maybe--no.

286
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,745
Look, Caroline,

287
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:34,847
if this were truly
a business transaction,

288
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:38,182
you'd have cupcakes here
to show me, but you don't.

289
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,886
I know all about
your business.

290
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:41,054
Stephanie googled you.

291
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:43,273
She has the strength
to Google?

292
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:46,608
Has she googled
"How to eat"?

293
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,862
See yourselves out.

294
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,699
I'm going to my dermatologist
for a little procedure.

295
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:54,567
I want to take two years
off my face

296
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:57,570
just so people will think,
"Is she 38 or 39?

297
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:59,438
It's so hard to tell."

298
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,558
But just so you know,
you were my last chance

299
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,911
to keep my dream
and our business alive.

300
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,579
You're resourceful.
You'll think of something.

301
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,780
Now come here.

302
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:08,948
In spite of it all,
we are family.

303
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,249
Give me a hug.

304
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,952
Ow!

305
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:17,123
Wow.

306
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,591
She's kind of a monster,

307
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:21,926
but she gave me free stuff,
so I'm torn.

308
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,706
Aunt Charity's
a smart businesswoman.

309
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:32,408
She won't be able
to deny a good product.

310
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,143
I can't believe
I'm making cupcakes

311
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:36,245
so you can go back for round two
with that woman.

312
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:39,315
Auntie Charity
might be the anti-Christ.

313
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,685
I'll do anything
to keep our business going.

314
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,219
And if these cupcakes
don't work,

315
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,571
we'll tell her
you're Pakistani

316
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,489
and let her go after it.

317
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:50,492
Even if you do convince her
to give us the money,

318
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:51,560
that's bitch money.

319
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,162
We don't take bitch money.

320
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:56,497
Max, you pick up pennies
off the pee corner.

321
00:12:57,284 --> 00:13:00,617
Not true.
Dimes and up.

322
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,374
Hi!
We'll just be a second.

323
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:07,242
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Cool hair, David Bowie.

324
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,461
Okay, she's definitely
not seeing anyone today.

325
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,046
Sorry to burst in,
Aunt Charity,

326
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:14,381
but we wanted you to have
some of our cupcakes.

327
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:18,920
It took two layers
to take off two years,

328
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,689
but it was worth it.

329
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:24,024
Just so you know,
the third layer is bone.

330
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:28,080
Either I'm high,
or my chair melted.

331
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:30,199
Okay, you're high.

332
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,718
She's on morphine lollipops
for the pain.

333
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,053
Really? 'Cause I'd like
to be on one for the fun.

334
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,491
♪ I got that
boom boom boom ♪

335
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:41,377
♪ I got that boom boom boom

336
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,995
♪ I got that
boom boom boom ♪

337
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:45,581
Okay, it's time
to change your face mask.

338
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,416
You know what?
Let me do that.

339
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:48,917
I can help
my aunt Charity.

340
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,054
I'll do anything
to help someone in my family

341
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:54,056
because families
help each other.

342
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,290
Well, why don't you
help yourself

343
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,625
to an adult-sized
pair of boobies?

344
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,014
Like my boobs,
like my nose.

345
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:04,400
Okay,
here's the new face mask.

346
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,185
You peel the soiled one off,

347
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:09,271
then swab the affected area
with Q-tips.

348
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:10,489
And I left modeling

349
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,824
because I thought it
was degrading.

350
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,762
- Question, Stephanie.
- Yeah?

351
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:18,030
Do these come
in orange, or lime,

352
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,832
or is it just
the white flavor?

353
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:20,750
Ah, screw it.

354
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:23,819
After a couple of licks,
it won't matter.

355
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,838
I'm happy to do this for you,
Aunt Charity,

356
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,490
and not just for the money,
but 'cause we're family.

357
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,826
I hate you.

358
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,461
Always have.

359
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,596
You can't mean that,
Aunt Charity.

360
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:37,931
Up until you were born,
I was the family princess.

361
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,386
And then you came in,
and you got the boom boom boom

362
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:43,439
and you took
my boom boom boom.

363
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:46,774
So I locked you
in a room room room.

364
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,694
Well, I'm sorry you think
I took your boom boom boom,

365
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,115
but you really did
take my seagull cup

366
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,483
and lock me in a room.

367
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,984
Room room.

368
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,537
I'm not giving you any money,
little girl.

369
00:14:58,539 --> 00:14:59,905
Just so you know.

370
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,023
Well,
maybe you'll feel differently

371
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,326
after you taste
one of our cupcakes.

372
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,528
Here, why don't we take
a minute for a little bite?

373
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,297
Nope, I don't want it.

374
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,365
It'll show you what a good
business investment we are.

375
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,501
Here, come--come here.

376
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,503
Just--oh--just taste it.

377
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:15,654
Here.

378
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,139
Come on, taste--
take a bite.

379
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,141
This is pretty disturbing.

380
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:23,476
I would intervene right now
if I wasn't feeling amazing.

381
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,482
Yummy, right?

382
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:27,900
Oh, no, no, no, no.

383
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:29,184
No, no, no, that's your face.

384
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,487
I think you're
chewing your face.

385
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:34,822
That's the best cupcake
I have ever had,

386
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,744
but I am still not
giving you any money.

387
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:40,529
Why not?
It's the least you could do

388
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,230
after you broke
my seagull cup.

389
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,367
Oh, my God, are you still
talking about that seagull cup?

390
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:48,086
I haven't thought
about that in 15 years.

391
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,789
If we're gonna be talking
about that stupid seagull cup,

392
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,709
I'm gonna need
another lollipop.

393
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,879
Where does she keep them?

394
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:59,748
Oh, here, they're in this cup
that has a seagull on it.

395
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,768
Wait.

396
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,971
Where have I
heard of seagull cup before?

397
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,107
That's my
night-night cocoa cup.

398
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,726
I knew it wasn't broken.

399
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,928
You hid it and kept it
all these years?

400
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,530
Yep.

401
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,765
Why would you want
to hurt me like that?

402
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,400
It's obvious.

403
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:20,035
She's obsessed
with her brother,

404
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,370
and she saw your being born

405
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,956
as his love being
taken away from her.

406
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,291
Damn, this thing
makes me smart.

407
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:29,244
Well,
I hope you're happy now,

408
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,947
because I lost a lot more
than my night-night cocoa cup.

409
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,332
I lost my money, my father,

410
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,967
and now I'm about
to lose my dream.

411
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:36,718
And you know what?
We're done.

412
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,554
You know what?
We are not done.

413
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:39,888
I am not a quitter.

414
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,924
I said I would
put your new face on,

415
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:45,259
so I'm not leaving here
until I do.

416
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,230
Her face is gone.

417
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,565
She's basically
the Phantom of the Channing.

418
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:58,070
All right,
that's close enough.

419
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:00,826
And stop calling me spoiled.

420
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,828
Since I lost it all,
I've worked hard.

421
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,830
I've cleaned toilets,
I've killed rats,

422
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,282
I've done everything
I had to to be a success.

423
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:08,467
Tell her, Max.

424
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,202
♪ I got that
boom boom boom ♪

425
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:12,337
- ♪ I got that boom--
- Okay, fine. Let's go.

426
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,705
Stop.

427
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,124
Fine, I'll give you
the money.

428
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:19,459
Not--not just because
you're my niece,

429
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:23,599
but because you
forced yourself in here

430
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,518
like a pushy businesswoman,
which is--

431
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,805
you shoved your cupcake
down my throat.

432
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:33,140
That is exactly
what I would have done.

433
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,729
25,000,

434
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:41,064
signed Char-ity Chan...

435
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,070
Oh, no.

436
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:47,789
Aunt Charity,
are you all right?

437
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,459
Oh, and she didn't
finish signing it.

438
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:53,528
Well, it's my last name too,
so...

439
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,581
...ing.

440
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,467
I can't get it out
from under her head.

441
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:01,802
Pull her hair!
Now's your chance.

442
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,058
Ow.

443
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,848
Bob, I don't feel
you are getting across

444
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,150
my passion about this,
so I'll just sign it.

445
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:18,020
That check
should have cleared.

446
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:21,355
That time, you said,
"Your face looks like a butt."

447
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:25,575
I appreciate how hard you've
tried to stay in business,

448
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,029
but do the smart thing.

449
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,448
Take the money.
Start fresh.

450
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,334
All you have to do
is sign this.

451
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:33,669
Well,
we will have to discuss it.

452
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:35,236
- My partner has a be--
- Just sign it.

453
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:38,571
Good discussion.

454
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:42,511
Caroline Chan--

455
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:44,746
Max, a little help.

456
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,766
...ing.

457
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,384
So, as of this moment,

458
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:52,137
this space is no longer
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

459
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:55,472
Congratulations
and good luck.

460
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,943
Well, there goes Joanne
and that deaf lady.

461
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,069
We are keeping the arrow.

462
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:10,404
I can't believe my aunt would
stop payment on that check.

463
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,041
And I can't believe she'd
show up here after she did.

464
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:18,330
Aunt Charity,
do you know

465
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,115
what I'm thinking
about you right now?

466
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,450
What? I look 38 or 39,
it's hard to tell?

467
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,171
Oh, don't look so wounded.

468
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:27,806
You know I had
to stop that check.

469
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,425
You took advantage of someone
in a morphine haze.

470
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,561
If you think that
was being taken advantage of,

471
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:35,597
you've never blacked out
at a pep rally.

472
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,133
Yes, I stopped that check,
but here.

473
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,068
This seems important to you.

474
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,486
Seemed.

475
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:43,438
Seemed when I was rich.

476
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,157
Now I have real problems.

477
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,076
Yeah, and where
are them lollipops at?

478
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,411
- You took away my future.
- And my lollipops.

479
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:55,000
No, Caroline,
I took away my money.

480
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,785
And by forcing you
to find you own way,

481
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:58,837
I may have given you
a better future.

482
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:02,172
Cute shop.
Too big, too soon.

483
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:04,509
You'll figure it out.

484
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:08,163
Aunt Charity?

485
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,498
You look 42.

486
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,668
We all know I don't.

487
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,058
The shop's over.

488
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,178
Wow, I thought for sure
we'd be a success.

489
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,814
Well,
who says we're not?

490
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,649
I mean,
we had some fun, right?

491
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,984
And we have
a cool-ass red arrow.

492
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:32,454
And we have this big check,

493
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:33,989
which is just enough
to pay back Sophie

494
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,324
and everybody else
we owe money to.

495
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:37,642
That's true.

496
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,461
So in a way,
we're kind of success.

497
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:42,247
I mean, we did go
from broke to broke even.

498
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,799
We nailed it.

499
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,835
I just wish we
had a clear-cut sign

500
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:49,370
that letting go of this place
was the right thing to do.

501
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,713
Ehr mah gerd!

502
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,349
My night-night cocoa cup.

503
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,684
You wanted a sign?
That's your sign!

504
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,189
No matter what hits you,
you'll be okay.

505
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:13,326
Well, I feel sorry
for whoever owns this dump.

506
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:21,326
