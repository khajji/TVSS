1
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:05,675
I can't believe Han is making
us tidy up this damn diner.

2
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:09,311
It's like putting
a pretty church hat on a whore.

3
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:14,950
Come on, harder, faster!
Do it faster and harder.

4
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:20,356
Ding! What is, "Things Han
says to a male hustler," Alex.

5
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:21,623
No time for jokes, Max.

6
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:23,325
The health inspector
will be here soon,

7
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:25,194
and I need to get
that "A" rating.

8
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,629
This diner getting an "A"
for cleanliness

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,266
would be like me getting an "A"
for a bra size.

10
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,269
Oh, it will happen.
I did a thorough job.

11
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,913
Is he making omelets
or crystal meth?

12
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,385
Oleg, you let Han put you
in two hair nets?

13
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:52,789
Three.
I don't want to talk about it.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,225
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

15
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:01,430

17
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,993
Sorry I'm late.
I was having my nails done.

18
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:14,995
It's the first time
I stopped moving in two years,

19
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,731
and I fell asleep.

20
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,933
You had money to get
your nails done?

21
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:22,035
Was prostitution
as disgusting

22
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:24,905
as you thought it would be?

23
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:26,206
Han paid for it.

24
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:28,675
Oh, so it was worse.

25
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:31,311
There she is.

26
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:33,480
There's my show pony.

27
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,583
Let me see them digits.

28
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,985
I want you to be the first thing
the health inspector sees

29
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:39,986
when he enters.

30
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,856
You're just so blonde
and clean.

31
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:47,861
Hey! Where's my manicure?
How come I don't get anything?

32
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:50,630
Oh, I haven't forgotten you.
Here's 50 bucks.

33
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,899
Beat it until
the inspector leaves.

34
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,239
Some would be insulted.
I'm gonna ask for $75.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,508
And, you are going to get it.

36
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,380
I have exciting news.
At the nail salon,

37
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,983
I heard about this amazing
seminar we should go to.

38
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:12,319
Oh, no, no, no.

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,187
I went to a seminar once.

40
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:17,290
I was almost married
to 300 Koreans.

41
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,060
It's a branding seminar
for business owners

42
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,262
to define who they are
and get them primed and ready

43
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:24,264
for their window
of opportunity.

44
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:27,701
I think I'd rather be married
to 300 Koreans.

45
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:30,570
Then I could get my nails done
whenever I wanted.

46
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,139
Max, this is the real deal.

47
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,241
The woman who runs it
is a branding genius.

48
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,376
She created the Nike
"Just Do It."

49
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,411
Oh, that woman
didn't make up "just do it."

50
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:41,448
high school boyfriends have been
using that for centuries.

51
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,717
You're still here!

52
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:46,620
What's it gonna take,
another $10?

53
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:48,855
Hey, I don't need a seminar.

54
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:53,226
I found a brand that's gonna
get me rich--obnoxious!

55
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,796
Okay, Earl, how is cleaning
your area coming along?

56
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:58,431
I've got decades
of napkins over here

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,534
with all my old ideas on them.

58
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,804
Apparently,
napkins were the old Twitter.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,574
Hello.

60
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:08,508
Could you tell the owner

61
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:10,410
the health inspector
has arrived?

62
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,245
Oh, you are a woman.

63
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:14,447
Thank you for noticing.

64
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,751
Are you Han Lee?

65
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:19,953
Hey, Han, is this the--

66
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,491
So where would you like
to start?

67
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:26,927
Sadly, the men's room.

68
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:29,496
Ground zero.

69
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:31,464
I will join you
in a second.

70
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,500
Is it Miss or Mrs. Rotello?

71
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:36,703
It's Miss.
Thank you for asking.

72
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:40,740
I'll see you at the toilets.

73
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,743
Ground zero just got
a lot nicer.

74
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:52,052
Han, I think that health
inspector wants to inspect you.

75
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,788
Stop! If she hears you,
she'll give me an "F."

76
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,524
I think she wants you
to give her an "F."

77
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:01,795
Max, I paid you $90.
Now, go!

78
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:04,998
- Here, Max.
- What's this?

79
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,101
That's how we'll make
the $600 we need for the seminar.

80
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,402
I made flyers for
a yard sale at Kinko's.

81
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:13,006
Wow, Kinko's" and "yard sale"
in the same breath.

82
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:16,142
Where do I keep finding
this inner strength?

83
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,917
That must be Sophie
with her yard sale stuff.

84
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:26,003
Hi, girls!

85
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,072
Hey, Sophie!
Where's all your junk?

86
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:32,093
Oh, where it always is--
In my trunk!

87
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,496
Well, look here.

88
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,298
I got a bunch of stuff
that Oleg wanted

89
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,433
to donate to your yard sale.

90
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,135
Aw, that's so nice of him.

91
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:43,538
Oh, yeah,
he doesn't know about it.

92
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:44,639
Yeah, it's all the stuff

93
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,874
he's been leaving around
my apartment.

94
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,343
He's getting way
too comfortable, so...

95
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:53,114
Sell it all!
Yeah.

96
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,384
You probably can get a couple
of bucks for his passport.

97
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,786
Yeah, he paid $80 for it.

98
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,454
Maybe he's leaving
things around

99
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:02,790
because he wants to take things
to another level,

100
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,325
maybe even move in.

101
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:08,496
Oh, girl talk.
Ooh!

102
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:12,667
Shouldn't you serve me a cosmo
like they do on television?

103
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:15,169
Don't have any cosmos,
as we're broke

104
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,272
and it's not 1998, but...

105
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,607
How about a pink cupcake?

106
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,542
Oh, even better.

107
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,845
Maybe now that Oleg
has told you he loves you,

108
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:27,148
you're starting to have intimacy
issues about getting close.

109
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:29,150
Oh, come on.

110
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:32,420
Save that garbage
for your yard sale.

111
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:35,656
Yeah, the man is just
up there too much.

112
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:39,794
I mean, he's down there when
he's up there, but, yeah...

113
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:42,163
It's way too much, yeah.

114
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,098
He's got to change,
or he's out.

115
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:47,168
Hey, thanks
for the cupcake, Max.

116
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,136
And, Caroline...

117
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,439
I don't know what you add,
but, yeah.

118
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:56,377
Our yard sale is not quite
all set up yet.

119
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,346
You're early.
Our flyer said 1:00 to 5:00.

120
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:01,015
Oh, I don't do flyers.

121
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,150
Miss Trudy, my card.

122
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:07,788
This is my wife, Miss Trudy,
and the bird's name is Scott.

123
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,457
Dennis Endicott The Third,

124
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,860
thrift shop scout and Brooklyn's
crazy kitsch genius.

125
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,230
"Lord of The Things."

126
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,269
So, I have lots
of classic couture pieces.

127
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,637
You won't be disappointed.

128
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:26,307
Well, I have been before.
Miss Trudy?

129
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,876
We went all the way
to Pennsylvania for

130
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,811
a <i>Facts of Life</i> bean bag
toss game.

131
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,947
- No Blair!
- No Blair.

132
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:35,149
Just two tooties.

133
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,519
Life just sucks
it hard sometimes.

134
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,454
Am I right, Scott?

135
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:41,856
So, on that chair
are my things,

136
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:43,024
and you'll notice
that there's a lot--

137
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,726
Oh, I already did.
14 for all of it.

138
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,295
$1,400, perfect!

139
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:50,698
Hundred?
Darling, $14.

140
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,434
But this is all vintage.

141
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:56,070
Vintage, or just
out of season?

142
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,073
Wait, is that a Nugget Buddy?

143
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:00,775
Miss Trudy,
they have the cowboy.

144
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:02,109
He loves the cowboy.

145
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,246
I bet he does.

146
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,914
Oh, I am so relieved.

147
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:09,684
When we don't find anything
good, he gets really mad...

148
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:11,719
At me.

149
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,621
I'm sorry, that's not supposed
to be out.

150
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:14,922
I can't break up the set.

151
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:17,024
You have all ten
Nugget Buddies?

152
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:20,361
Yep, and every other
Happy Meal toy since 1993.

153
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:21,996
My mom used to take me there
a lot.

154
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:25,800
Well, she used to leave
me there a lot, but same diff.

155
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:27,535
$600 for the whole collection.

156
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:29,570
- Sold!
- Whoa, whoa, not sold.

157
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,405
Max, come on,
this is our future.

158
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,607
Well, those are my past.
No sale.

159
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:34,842
Let's go, Scott.

160
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,712
This is "tootie-gate"
all over again.

161
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,046
And you--

162
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:42,216
when we get home, you better put
on the punishment pillow.

163
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,255
Don't worry.
I kind of like it.

164
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,226
Well, so much for a horse
in a hat

165
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,628
being the weirdest thing
in this yard.

166
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,560
Explain to me again how
an item I paid $3,000 for

167
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:10,079
just two years ago
is worth less than something

168
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,348
that came
with a dipping sauce!

169
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:17,153
A Happy Meal toy reminds
people of a sweeter time,

170
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:20,423
a simpler time,
a pre-Kardashian time.

171
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:22,892
Attention, attention!

172
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,827
I have something
very important here.

173
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:27,563
The results of your DNA test
proving your mother was Asian

174
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:29,765
and your father
was a pine nut?

175
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:32,969
No, we got our letter grade

176
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,705
from the city
health inspector's office.

177
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,943
Whoo!
We got a "B"!

178
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:42,478
That's the first "B"
I ever got

179
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,548
I didn't have
to French kiss for.

180
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:47,316
A "B"?
No, no, no, no!

181
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,118
This boy don't play
with no Bs.

182
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,321
I'm calling that little tease,
Miss Jean Rotello, right now.

183
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,692
This isn't good.
Asians don't do well with Bs.

184
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,061
At Wharton, I got a "B,"
and the Japanese kid

185
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:01,797
who sat next to me
killed himself.

186
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,738
Oleg, I'm kind of getting used
to this look now.

187
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,774
You kind of look like
Bin Laden's ghost.

188
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,746
Good night, girls.

189
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,215
I'm going to go over and spend
the night at Sophie's.

190
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:20,550
No, maybe not.

191
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,617
Why would you say that?

192
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:24,921
Because she can't
stop herself.

193
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:27,456
It's just, she might like
a little space sometimes.

194
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,292
She needs space?
Did she say that?

195
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:33,663
- Not in so many words.
- No, those were the words.

196
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,831
Look, Sophie
loves having you around.

197
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,099
It's just, she told us that
you're getting

198
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,768
a little too comfortable there
when she came over

199
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,670
to sell all your stuff
at our yard sale.

200
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:44,840
- I know how that sounds--
- And yet, you keep going.

201
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,445
Oleg, Sophie is just feeling
a little smothered.

202
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,846
She feels smothered?

203
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,083
Have you ever tried
motorboating those cans of hers?

204
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,890
Once, but I was very drunk
at the time.

205
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:06,996
Just make a few changes,

206
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,564
and everything will
be right back on track.

207
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,333
And stop talking now.

208
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:13,169
Make some changes?
That's all I've done for her.

209
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,871
I changed my furniture,
I changed my ways.

210
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:18,941
I changed my underwear
more than once a week.

211
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:25,715
That's it.
No more changing for Han...

212
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,184
And no more changing
for Sophie.

213
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:36,392
I'm done changing.
I'm back, baby.

214
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,561
Spread the word!

215
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:50,873
I think he's gonna be
spreading more than the word.

216
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:52,675
I want to kill someone!

217
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,978
Why, did they cancel
<i>Suite Life of Zack and Cody?</i>

218
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,984
No, I just got off the phone
with the restaurant inspector--

219
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,053
She answered her phone
at this time of night?

220
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:07,256
Come on, it's not like
she was out on the town.

221
00:11:07,257 --> 00:11:08,624
Han!

222
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,861
I think that "B" you're holding
might stand for "Bitch."

223
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:14,296
And she told me I got a "B"
because of the conditions

224
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:16,666
of the back room
off the dishwasher area.

225
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,535
I didn't even know we had
a back room, did you?

226
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:21,904
No, but of course there's
a mysterious back room

227
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,305
in this new upside down world,

228
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,876
where a piece of cheese is mayor
and Donna Karan is a no one!

229
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:33,315
Oh, there it is.

230
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,750
I always thought
that was the property

231
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,252
of the bar next door.

232
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,254
If we share a door with a bar,

233
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:42,758
my breaks are about
to get longer and drunker.

234
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,494
Wait here, girls,
while I push this rack away.

235
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:56,839
P90X, don't fail me now!

236
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:09,618
I'm pretty sure this is what
my soul looks like.

237
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,490
Now I'm going to have to hire
an emergency crew to come

238
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,859
clean this by Friday
to get my "A."

239
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,194
Oh, damn it.

240
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,962
I guess Caroline
and I can do it.

241
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:22,665
Are you insane?
Max, I can't.

242
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,634
I haven't worked on
the railroads like you.

243
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:27,002
Come on.

244
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,572
Han needs his "A," and we need
the money for that seminar.

245
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:31,974
Isn't this one of those
"windows of opportunity"?

246
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:35,277
- $600.
- Forget it, girls.

247
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:36,345
Look at these walls.

248
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:38,481
I need professional
steam cleaners.

249
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:39,882
I have steam cleaned before.

250
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,884
I mean, how else do you get
malt liquor and blood stains

251
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,019
out of a rented prom dress?

252
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,492
Ugh, it's so humid
and damp in here.

253
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,694
Now I know how balls feel.

254
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:00,903
Let me just move
this cord out of--

255
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,838
Oh! I just got a shock!

256
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:03,906
No.

257
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,841
A shock is coming home
to find your mom

258
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:08,110
in the tub with
your tenth-grade crush.

259
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,581
I should push these
light cords back up over--

260
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,288
Uh, it's a roach nest.

261
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:24,960
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

262
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,529
It's okay!

263
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,532
Good news,
they're already dead.

264
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,500
Bad news, as I pull them

265
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:34,270
out of your hair,
they're decomposing.

266
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,572
Are you crying?

267
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,740
I can't do this.

268
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,809
Not even for the seminar.

269
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,178
I'll sell my Happy Meals.

270
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:43,679
Max, you don't have
to do that.

271
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,915
- But we need the money.
- Okay, great.

272
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:55,594
Hey, Nugget Buddies.

273
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,629
As soon as the man
with the bird gets here,

274
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,064
you'll be leaving
my loving care

275
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:01,233
and going out
into the big, bad world.

276
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:03,001
Shoes will step on you,

277
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,502
kids will tie you
to firecrackers,

278
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:07,972
and some real sickos may stick you
in a trunk and drive you across state lines.

279
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,642
Hi, Sophie.

280
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,080
Oleg cheated on me,
and I'm so  maaad!

281
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,569
Oh, I have to break things!

282
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,905
But everything upstairs
in my apartment is too nice!

283
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,675
So... Run a tab, girls!

284
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,448
Aah!

285
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,025
I gotta break more things!

286
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,960
Wait, don't break that box!
That's my Happy--

287
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,132
Ohh.

288
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,267
I feel better.

289
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,136
I really do.

290
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:59,973
Okay.
All right.

291
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:01,841
I think we just saw what
it would look like

292
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,444
if someone cheated
on The Incredible Hulk.

293
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,049
Hey, girls.

294
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,185
Sophie's back.
Spread the word!

295
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,726
Max, look,
your Happy Meal toys.

296
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,301
Look, I know you're upset
about your toys, Max,

297
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,171
but come on,
it's kind of fun.

298
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:33,239
There is only one kind of wet
that I have been at 3:00

299
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,742
in the morning
that I would call "fun."

300
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:37,911
This is not it!

301
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:42,415
Oh, look!
Under the newspaper,

302
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,684
there's some sort of
stained glass window there.

303
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,820
Aw, pretty!

304
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,356
Oh, you're finally getting
the money you wanted

305
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,424
and you're so chipper.

306
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,960
I'm "chipper,"
to use your word, because

307
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,763
we're working to earn money to
move our business brand forward.

308
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:58,298
Stop saying "brand."

309
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,701
And this "seminar"
better be worth it.

310
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,269
Why are you saying
it like that?

311
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,004
"Seminar," with quotes
around it,

312
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,806
like it's a silly idea
or something.

313
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:08,575
I didn't say "seminar"
with quotes around it.

314
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,343
You did.
You said--

315
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,544
Ooh! Ooh, sorry!

316
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:13,413
Sorry!

317
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:15,882
I was trying to illustrate that
you put quotes around it.

318
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,785
I am too tired to put quotes
around things,

319
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,620
but if I were gonna put quotes
on a word,

320
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:23,456
that word would be,
"seminar"!

321
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,125
Oh, and "branding"!

322
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:28,328
And I would put big, giant,
dumbass quotes around

323
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,663
"branding seminar"!

324
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,866
Max, you did that
on purpose!

325
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,568
Oh, maybe it was just
an accident!

326
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,907
Stop! Stop!
You're spraying the light cord!

327
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:43,376
Hello!
Water and electricity,

328
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,945
not the best combo!

329
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:49,616
Like some other not-great combos
I can think of.

330
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:52,218
Us?
You mean us?

331
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,487
What, now we are not
a great combo?

332
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,556
Oh, wow.

333
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,193
Sorry I suggested we go
to a quote-seminar-unquote.

334
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,761
Sorry I'm trying
to move us forward.

335
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:04,497
Sorry that you think
you know how to do everything.

336
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:07,333
Sorry that you resent the fact
that I know how to do business.

337
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:10,003
Sorry that you think you know
how to do business,

338
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,572
and maybe that's why
our first business failed.

339
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,743
Sorry that you took two
weed breaks every single day

340
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,178
instead of making work calls,

341
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,547
and maybe that's why
our business failed.

342
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:23,650
Sorry that I didn't take
more weed breaks,

343
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:25,952
because I really could have
used them working with

344
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:27,053
a know-it-all like you!

345
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:28,421
- And sorry--
- It's my turn!

346
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,357
No! Sorry that you, also,
had to stick your nose

347
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:32,625
into Oleg and Sophie's
business,

348
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,527
so that he cheated,
and she got mad and then,

349
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:37,363
by an almost irrefutable
line of direct action,

350
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:38,765
you killed my toys!

351
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,834
Sorry that it doesn't matter

352
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:43,770
how many things I ever did right
because poor itty-bitty

353
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,006
baby Max's Happy Meal toys
got all broked!

354
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:50,243
Don't push me, Max!

355
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,949
You're such a fan of branding,

356
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,484
"Just Do It."

357
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:59,752
"Have it your way."

358
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:02,856
"What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."

359
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,724
"Got Milk?"

360
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,260
Got any other
stupid business ideas?

361
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:11,965
Stop!

362
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,266
Stop, stop,
stop it, stop it!

363
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,768
I am done!

364
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,971
No, <i>I'm</i> done!

365
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,572
No, we're both done!

366
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,241
Fine, we're both done!

367
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:22,775
- Done!
- Done!

368
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,811
No, I'm really done, Max!

369
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,546
I'm tired of trying
to make things happen!

370
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:29,249
I'm tired of pushing us
into cupcake shops!

371
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,151
And I'm tired of you pushing
us into cupcake shops too.

372
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,022
Shops that we couldn't afford
in the first place.

373
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,426
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Max!

374
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,395
Max, are you all right?

375
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:43,596
CPR, what is it?

376
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,131
Do you do pinch the nose
and breathe into the mouth?

377
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:46,366
Wait, wait!

378
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:49,469
I think you're supposed
to pump the chest first.

379
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,405
Well, I'll never
get through those!

380
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,841
Max, I'm about to put
my mouth on yours,

381
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,311
so if you're kidding
you better wake up right now.

382
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,150
Max, please don't die.

383
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:06,686
Please don't die.
You're my best friend.

384
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,591
Sit up!
Sit up, sit up!

385
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:14,160
- Are you all right?
- What happened?

386
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:15,261
You grabbed that wire,

387
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:17,964
and I think you got
a little electrocuted.

388
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,399
I always knew
I'd be electrocuted,

389
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,702
I just thought it would be
in the chair.

390
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,870
God, I'm so hot.
I need air.

391
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,006
Come here.
The window, come on.

392
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:28,207
Come on.
Come on, over here.

393
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,877
Here, kneel.
Open!

394
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,211
Oh, damn,
there are shutters.

395
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,480
Here, hold on to the wall
while I get this.

396
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:40,019
Are you okay?
Take a deep breath in.

397
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,021
Breathe in.

398
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,189
Max, that was so scary.

399
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,958
For a second,
I thought you died.

400
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:48,561
Maybe I did, 'cause I kind
of remember a place with flames.

401
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,265
And you were making out with me.

402
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,634
What is that delicious smell?

403
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,836
The pizza place next
to the bar next door.

404
00:19:56,837 --> 00:20:00,139
Oh, God, has a pizza
ever smelled so good?

405
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:02,675
Hey, what are you guys
doing?

406
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,510
Is that, like,
a store or something?

407
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:07,280
- No.
- Holler.

408
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,217
Wait, Caroline...

409
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:14,087
This is our window
of opportunity!

410
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,722
Max, what a great idea!

411
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:18,658
A cupcake walk-up window?
You're a genius!

412
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:21,995
I just might be
since I died!

413
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,596
So much less overhead.

414
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,298
And this time we'll be starting
at the bottom,

415
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,200
so we'll have nowhere
to go but up.

416
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,369
Thank God!
I am so much more comfortable

417
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,371
at the bottom!

418
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:35,308
Hey, I have
this weird feeling inside.

419
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,277
I'm McHappy.

420
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:40,480
Hey, girls.

421
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:45,184
Turning tricks in a window
like they do in Amsterdam?

422
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,420
No, we think we found
our new business.

423
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:50,556
Sophie, this is the new
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

424
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:55,762
Speaking of windows,
that's Oleg's car, right?

425
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:56,963
Oh.

426
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,165
Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:07,974
Well, some people open
windows, some people smash them.

428
