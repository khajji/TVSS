1
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:05,207
Get the birthday candle ready,
'cause...

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:09,594
Here comes Chestnut's
carrot cake!

3
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:11,763
I know we want this
to be special,

4
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,431
but Chestnut is a horse.

5
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,433
Any day he's not being made
into an Ikea meatball

6
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:18,770
is a birthday.

7
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:21,139
And remember, even though
it's his tenth birthday,

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,642
we have to pretend he's six or
he'll be in a bad mood all week.

9
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:28,813
Surprise!

10
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:32,217
Happy Birthday, Chestnut!

11
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:34,119
Max! He was supposed
to do that!

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,154
What?
I know what he wished for.

13
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,256
That one day,
he and I live in a world

14
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,724
where our love is recognized

15
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:42,293
and we have the same rights
as gay couples.

16
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,963
There you go, baby.

17
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:47,399
Hey, look,
his shoe just fell off.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,302
Or maybe he kicked it off 'cause
he's getting ready to par-tay.

19
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:53,338
What are we gonna do?

20
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:54,572
We don't have any money.

21
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,174
I wanted a massage last week,

22
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:57,675
so I just sat next
to someone on the bus

23
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,844
who looked like he'd touch me.

24
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:02,881
I may have an idea
how we can get 'em.

25
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:05,817
A guy I picked up at Oktoberfest
is a blacksmith.

26
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:07,252
At least I think he was.

27
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:11,254
I remember a leather apron and
something being heated in a fire.

28
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:14,626
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

29

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

31
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,274
Well, I found my blacksmith.

32
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,809
He now shares
an artisan barn

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,213
with a lady who makes clothing
out of bees.

34
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:37,215
I guess that's why
our cupcake shop didn't work.

35
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:40,351
We weren't providing a service
that everyone needs.

36
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,719
I looked at our boy,

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,222
and not only does Chestnut
need four new shoes,

38
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:45,723
he has a hoof fungus.

39
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:49,093
A hoof fungus?
That's so ghetto.

40
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,695
I'm pretty sure
he got it from me

41
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:53,364
because we shower together.

42
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:56,467
And the cost of new shoes
and vet fee? $1,400.

43
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:58,236
Max, I feel awful.

44
00:01:58,237 --> 00:01:59,737
I'm a bad mother.

45
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:00,972
You're not a bad mother.

46
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:04,742
I know bad mothers.
I came out of one.

47
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:07,178
Ladies, what's happening
over there?

48
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,513
You know a gathering of more
than two white people

49
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:12,383
makes me nervous.

50
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:13,718
Earl, one of them's Asian.

51
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,554
Ah, same thing.

52
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,155
Who would I talk to
about the diner?

53
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,991
We're interested
in renting this location

54
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,425
to film a TV show.

55
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:24,629
We think your diner would be
a great place to kill someone.

56
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,863
I get it.

57
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,798
'Cause every time I come
in here, I die a little.

58
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,400
Here's my card.

59
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,102
Tom Woo, <i>Law & Order:</i>
<i>Special Victims Unit.</i>

60
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:34,505
Shut your face, Tom Woo!

61
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:38,309
I love all the <i>Law & Orders,</i>
especially <i>SVU.</i>

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,311
Their stories are ripped
from the headlines,

63
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:41,779
and I don't read
the newspaper,

64
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,714
so that's where I get
all my news.

65
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,283
Cool.
Let me go get the director.

66
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:46,784
That's him over there.

67
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:51,122
Look how cute the director is.
He's my rugged guy type.

68
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,657
Not really rugged at all,

69
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:54,158
but buys expensive,
rugged-looking clothing

70
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,060
from Saks 5th Avenue.

71
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:58,596
Hi.
DJ Kingsley.

72
00:02:58,597 --> 00:02:59,797
Nice beard.

73
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:01,098
You grow out that stubble

74
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,100
or just set your razor
to "Jason Statham."

75
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,935
Excuse me, sir.

76
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,437
You've got a great face.

77
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,072
Have you ever done
any extra work?

78
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:10,441
Well, I was
in the 1973 classic

79
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:13,377
<i>Scream, Blackula, Scream.</i>

80
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:16,047
Pam Grier kicked me
in the nuts

81
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,150
and called me a "jive turkey."

82
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,484
If you'd consider it,

83
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:21,952
I'd love to have your look
in the episode.

84
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:23,254
Hey, what about me?

85
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:25,256
You can shave my head,
drag me behind a car,

86
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:27,558
or anything else
I've already done for free.

87
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,294
Sure. And you must be
an actress.

88
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,496
You're way too pretty
to just be a waitress.

89
00:03:32,497 --> 00:03:34,231
Thank you!

90
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:37,268
In fact I have done
a little acting.

91
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,873
In high school, I portrayed
Fantine in <i>Les Miserables.</i>

92
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,977
Just hearing you say that
makes me "miser-obble."

93
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,746
Well, how about it?

94
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:51,015
You wanna hang with me and be an
extra on <i>Special Victims Unit?</i>

95
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,383
It pays 112 a day

96
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:54,118
plus whatever
you normally make in tips.

97
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:57,121
Oh, so about 115?
I'm in.

98
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,623
Mama needs a new pair
of horseshoes.

99
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:01,292
So where's the boss?

100
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:04,295
I'm the boss, but I'll get
the guy who owns the place.

101
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,097
Oleg!

102
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,431
They're shooting
a TV show here,

103
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:08,799
and the back of my head
or the side of my boob

104
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,267
is gonna be in it!

105
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:11,936
Good for you, Max.

106
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:14,138
I was on Ukraine's version
of <i>Big Brother</i> once,

107
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:17,174
better known as
<i>Just living in Ukraine.</i>

108
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:21,479
Han! <i>Law and Order:</i>
<i>Special Victims Unit</i>

109
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,581
wants to shoot in the diner,
and if you don't say yes,

110
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:26,650
you'll be my special victim
when I cut your unit off.

111
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,652
Please say yes, Han.

112
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,388
They're gonna pay us
to be in the background.

113
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,156
But do you know how to act?

114
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:34,091
Actually we do.

115
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:38,429
My acting's method,
whereas hers is more meth head.

116
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:41,899
Hey, come in.

117
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,668
And remember, if he says no,
he doesn't mean it.

118
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,737
He just wants you
to flirt with him a little bit.

119
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,172
Not so fast, Max.

120
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:51,409
Hello, I'm Han Lee,
the owner and proprietor.

121
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,643
Oh, "proprietor."

122
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:55,012
That's word's bigger
than you are.

123
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,515
What kinda compensation
do you want?

124
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:00,651
Whoa, whoa,
my Asian brother.

125
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,887
Slow down!
Let's enjoy the dance.

126
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,355
We'd like to shoot here.

127
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:06,123
It's got the right amount
of funk and skank.

128
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,691
If we do real good in this

129
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,827
and get a spin-off, that'll be
the name of our show--

130
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:11,829
<i>Funk and Skank.</i>

131
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,231
Okay,
but I don't wanna be Skank.

132
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,134
Oh, clearly I'm Skank.

133
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:18,936
And may I say I'm honored

134
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:21,705
I have such a worthy opponent
to barter with.

135
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,545
Dude, I'm from Pasadena.

136
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,081
I can't believe this!

137
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,550
I never thought I'd be
in a TV show

138
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:34,752
where no one was yelling,
"You are not the father!"

139
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:45,147
Let's go.
Bring in the waitress extras.

140
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,815
Ooh, I love these uniforms!

141
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:48,917
I feel like Brenda
from <i>90210</i>

142
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,020
when she was dressed as that
'50s waitress at the peach pit.

143
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,890
Well, when we're the big stars
of <i>Funk and Skank,</i>

144
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,525
we won't have to wear
any uniforms.

145
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,227
But wait,
aren't Funk and Skank cops?

146
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:02,363
Uh, no, they're hookers.

147
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:04,065
How about a compromise?

148
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,401
Cops by day,
prostitutes by night?

149
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:08,703
You know, copstitutes.

150
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:12,307
Either way,
we're New York's finest.

151
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:14,909
Okay, everybody, ready!
Here we go.

152
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,312
Look at Earl
over there.

153
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:18,980
Good luck, Earl!

154
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,915
Camera on the door.
Scene eight, take one.

155
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,752
And action!
Shooter comes in.

156
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,825
And cut! Good!
Reset.

157
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,494
Earl, that was inspiring.

158
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:36,264
I hope everyone who sees you
goes out and ignores a crime.

159
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:39,300
It was like that scene
was about the cash register guy.

160
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,102
You really brought
something extra.

161
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:42,937
I smell an Emmy.

162
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:45,607
Oh, that's weed.

163
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,610
Hi. Sorry we haven't gotten
to you guys yet.

164
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:49,911
Why don't you hang out
in the office?

165
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,279
I hear there's good Sushi.

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,580
You look pretty.

167
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,817
I think the director
kinda likes me.

168
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:58,621
Well, I don't know about him,
but his penis does.

169
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,556
Okay, camera on the door.

170
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:03,424
Scene eight, take two.

171
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:06,227
And action!
Shooter comes in.

172
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:09,330
Bang! Bang!

173
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,165
Cut!

174
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,568
Excuse me,
how did you get through?

175
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,203
Oh, please.

176
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:16,604
I once got through
the Berlin Wall.

177
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:20,475
You think two kids
with walkie-talkies can stop me?

178
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,877
Damn, this room's got
a sweet spread.

179
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:25,413
Free Sushi? Uh-yes.

180
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:28,483
Free dessert? Uh-duh.

181
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:29,751
This is great.

182
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,486
We've gotta figure out a way
to get paid

183
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:34,289
to sit around, eat free food,
and do nothing more often.

184
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,159
Oh, I think you cracked
that code a long time ago.

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,694
Would it be tacky

186
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,596
if I packed some Sushi
in my purse for later?

187
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:44,132
Already packed mine,
already packed yours.

188
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,402
This is the VIP lounge.

189
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:51,439
See? The shrimp
have already been de-turded.

190
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,607
Oh, hi, girls.

191
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:56,678
You finally got new uniforms.
You look stupid.

192
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,280
These are actually
from the costume department

193
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:01,282
of a little show called
<i>Law & Order: SVU</i>

194
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:03,217
that Max and I
are costarring in.

195
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:07,588
Costars? Honey, please.
You two are just extras.

196
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:12,660
Um, extra paid
and full of purse Sushi.

197
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,962
- They're ready for you two.
- Oh! Be right there.

198
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,465
Just gonna put my purse
in the fridge.

199
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,934
Thomas. Tom. T-pain.
Can we chat?

200
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,235
What is it, dude?

201
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,738
Your crew got soy sauce
all over my computer.

202
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:26,574
And according to our agreement,
you must pay all the damages.

203
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:29,210
- How much do you want?
- $300.

204
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,012
It's a piece of crap.

205
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:33,514
But it was a gift
from my father.

206
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:35,650
And you know how important
family is in our culture.

207
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:38,986
Again, I don't.
I was raised by two white women.

208
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,621
Oh, hey, hey.

209
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:44,058
Yes, uh, who do I talk to
about becoming a star?

210
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,864
This is so exciting!

211
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:52,166
God! That woman keeps
pushing my head down.

212
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,236
I feel like I'm on a date
with her.

213
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,405
Okay, so you guys are here
behind the counter,

214
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,740
doing your waitress thing.

215
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,174
Shooter aims for the cook

216
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,577
but hits her,
our featured waitress.

217
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,879
Hey, didn't I already see you
on <i>SVU?</i>

218
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,414
Oh, yeah, I remember.

219
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,182
They found your head
in a mini fridge in the Hudson.

220
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,517
I knew I recognized you.

221
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,285
Wait, we've already
killed you?

222
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:13,154
Sorry, babe, you're out.

223
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,789
Aw.

224
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,791
Well, you gave great head.

225
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,260
Tom, we gotta bump someone up
to the featured waitress.

226
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,129
Pays 1,000 more bucks.

227
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,463
Max, that could be
the extra money

228
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:23,765
we need for Chestnut.

229
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,266
Could one of us do it?

230
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,634
Can either of you act like
you've been hit with a bullet?

231
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:28,503
Well, it just so happens

232
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:30,838
I have been hit
by a bullet twice--

233
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,107
once at a 7-Eleven
and once running away

234
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,542
in the parking lot
of a 7-Eleven.

235
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:36,577
So yeah, I think I got this.

236
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,546
I'm thinking maybe a blonde
would be better.

237
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:39,847
Caroline?

238
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:42,750
Well, I did have a pretty
convincing death scene

239
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,685
as Fantine,
and I died like--

240
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,422
well, should I just show you?

241
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:02,370
You are such a nerd.

242
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,239
That's great, Caroline.

243
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,441
Special effects,

244
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:07,809
put the blood device
on Caroline.

245
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,976
She's our special victim.

246
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,411
Really? I got it?

247
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:12,413
Yes, but a little less
"French Revolution,"

248
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:15,383
and a lot more
"Face down on the floor."

249
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:18,953
You can't take a shot.
You can't even do a shot.

250
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:21,589
Don't be mad, Max.
I'm doing this for Chestnut.

251
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,758
And it's not my fault
he liked my death scene.

252
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,828
He liked your death scene
with his penis.

253
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,264
Wow, Max, show business really
brings out the worst in you.

254
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:31,968
You haven't seen me
at a wedding.

255
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,870
Hello!
You just put your hand

256
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,472
down a woman's blouse
without asking?

257
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,540
Every day.

258
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,143
Well, here.
Can I help you?

259
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:45,713
No, it's a union thing.

260
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,515
Aren't you in there
a little long?

261
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:50,084
Yeah. Let me just--

262
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,921
Caroline, that special
effects rig you're wearing

263
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:55,089
is very sensitive,

264
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,257
so don't let anything
near your chest.

265
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,794
Except me.

266
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,630
And don't be nervous.

267
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,632
The camera's gonna love you.
How could it not?

268
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,601
DJ, stop flirting with me.

269
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:10,172
I'm gonna die soon
and you'll never get over me.

270
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:14,008
Promise you'll die soon?

271
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,310
Max, I'm about to be shot,

272
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,279
and I can't die
with bad blood between us.

273
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,548
We're good.
You're living my dream, girl.

274
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,017
- Do me proud.
- I will.

275
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:25,253
No! Don't hug with it!

276
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:33,761
Caroline,
you set the thing off.

277
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:35,229
We weren't rolling.

278
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,833
Really? That's too bad,
because that was gold.

279
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:42,270
That's a wrap, everybody.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

280
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,572
I'm so sorry.
It just went off.

281
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:47,074
Prettiest screw-up all day.

282
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,309
After you get cleaned up,

283
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,844
why don't we have dinner
at my hotel?

284
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,712
Dinner?
Yeah, I'd like that.

285
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,080
Let's say 8:00.

286
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,650
My assistant will give you
the address and my room number.

287
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,720
You know, this is exactly
how you look in all my dreams

288
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:01,389
where I shoot you.

289
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,791
The director just invited me
to dinner at his hotel,

290
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,326
but it's in his room.

291
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:06,527
- Do you think he--
- Yes.

292
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:07,628
- Is that why he--
- Yes.

293
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:08,796
- Will you come with?
- Yes.

294
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:09,964
Maybe you're wrong.

295
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,165
Maybe he thought my audition
was really--

296
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,333
No.

297
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:15,804
Caroline, next time,
maybe a little less.

298
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:24,969
Now, remember.

299
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,337
This director slips you anything
that looks like a sweet tart,

300
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,172
it's probably that date rape
drug that knocks you out

301
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,607
and distorts your memory.

302
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:32,675
Or at least that's what it does
to the guys I give it to.

303
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:36,379
It's never gonna get to that.
I have my own date rape drug.

304
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,197
I talk about myself
incessantly

305
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,700
till guys get bored
and pass out.

306
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:42,802
So if that doesn't work,
what are your limits?

307
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,403
A little over the sweater,
under sweater,

308
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:47,507
a little front door, back door,
a little secret staircase?

309
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:50,643
I don't know what that is,
but no one goes up my staircase,

310
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,178
not even for Chestnut.

311
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,280
At the most,
I'll do kissing.

312
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:56,816
You are thinking
like an extra.

313
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,684
You need to think
like a star

314
00:12:58,685 --> 00:12:59,952
if you're gonna
buy Chestnut shoes,

315
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,522
then therapy, then a way
out of scientology.

316
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,692
Oh, hi.
You brought company.

317
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,529
Yes, she's my ride.
We share a subway card.

318
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,830
Well, she uses the card.

319
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,832
I jump the turnstile
and she pretends to chase me,

320
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,101
yelling "Don't worry, I'll get her!"

321
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,569
Well, come on in.

322
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,037
Stay for a glass
of champagne, Max.

323
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,972
Oh, and don't worry about
taking the subway home alone.

324
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,407
My driver can take you.

325
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,742
Now I'm torn.

326
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:24,110
Because as much
as I don't want you

327
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,444
to have sex
against your will,

328
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:28,381
I do wanna roll up
to the McDonald's in a limo.

329
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:29,782
There's no rush.

330
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:31,083
Come on, let's sit down
and hang out.

331
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:33,119
It was really nice of you
to invite me up here

332
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,555
to have a casual,
work-related dinner.

333
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:40,226
Max there, Caroline there,
and me, well, here.

334
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,595
Can't turn it off,
still directing.

335
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:47,266
Oh! You know,
I love this hotel.

336
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,335
I came here once
to do a photo shoot

337
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:50,803
for a "20 under 20:

338
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,438
Teen millionaires
to watch" spread,

339
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,708
and I remember I had
just gotten my haircut,

340
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,976
which was a big decision,

341
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,811
'cause I was kinda known
for my long hair.

342
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,479
And he wanted
to take an inch off,

343
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,747
which doesn't sound
like a big deal,

344
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:03,818
but when you're known
for your long hair...

345
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:09,722
People are expecting
to see you with long hair.

346
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,657
So was that okay?

347
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:14,160
Oh!
Yeah, sure.

348
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:15,461
It--it's just Max is here,

349
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:16,662
and I don't want her
to feel left out.

350
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:19,365
Sorry.
Got it.

351
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:24,470
That was nice.

352
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,439
You're a good kisser.

353
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,408
Are you eating
a cinnamon altoid?

354
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,878
I'm eating
a cinnamon altoid.

355
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:38,618
Well,
then I just tasted you.

356
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,820
Look, DJ, I think
you have the wrong idea.

357
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,056
Oh!
Hold that thought.

358
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,492
I would never interrupt this
for a work call,

359
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:49,929
but it's my wife and I wanna
say "good night" to the kids.

360
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,864
That guy's a player.

361
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:53,532
I'm not talking my way
out of this one.

362
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,067
We're screwed.

363
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,802
Yeah!
He's got a high tolerance.

364
00:14:56,803 --> 00:15:00,172
Your long-hair speech
almost roofied me.

365
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:02,608
What do we do, Max?
I don't want to offend him.

366
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:04,877
We need that extra money
for Chestnut.

367
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,846
This is the oldest tale
in the book--

368
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:09,548
a woman forced to trade her body
to get her child shoes.

369
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,284
It's Shakespearian,
it's Dickensian,

370
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,119
it's Kardashian.

371
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,887
Look at the bright side.

372
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:16,656
You already thought
he was sexy,

373
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:18,424
so you were probably
gonna sleep with him eventually.

374
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,859
And now that he's married,

375
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,427
you know he won't cheat on you
with somebody else

376
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:23,229
because you're
that somebody else.

377
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,231
You a side bitch!

378
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:28,200
No, Max, I can
just tell him how I feel.

379
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,435
Besides, he probably
already got it.

380
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,570
You heard me tell him
he read the signs wrong.

381
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:39,879
Apparently the sign he read
said "Three-way up ahead."

382
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,213
Pretty good, right?

383
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:42,748
Hit show, wife, kids.

384
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,850
Still find time
to get to the gym.

385
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:47,253
So you guys need to drink
a little more before we do this?

386
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,355
'Cause I don't.

387
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,723
All right,
I'm just gonna say this

388
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,291
before that towel
comes off.

389
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,627
I think you've misread
the signals here.

390
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:56,729
Really!
That sucks.

391
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,031
I'm sorry.
These things happen.

392
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,766
It reminds me of that time
I had tea

393
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,502
with that prince in Dubai
and he thought he bought me.

394
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:05,838
Turns out he bought
a different blonde.

395
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,107
Oh, men!

396
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,116
- Good morning, DJ.
- Morning!

397
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,385
See, Max?
No hard feelings.

398
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,687
I told you
it was gonna work out.

399
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:25,091
Hi! I'm ready
for my fake blood pouch.

400
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,429
Um, I think you got
the wrong breasts.

401
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,698
But for a rough guy,
you got a soft touch.

402
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,899
Yup.

403
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,468
There's been a change.

404
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:37,870
Uh, Max is now getting featured,
and you're in the B.G.--

405
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,505
Background.

406
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,807
- These are real?
- Yep.

407
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,410
Nice job.

408
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:47,046
You hear that, Max?
Now I'm in the B.G.

409
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,548
I didn't do DJ,
so I'm in the B.G.

410
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,183
Max!

411
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,586
We have time for
one full take before lunch,

412
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,921
then we'll come back and do
the rest of your coverage after.

413
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:57,723
Hey, maybe you and I could
have a little lunch together

414
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:58,991
in my trailer.

415
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,093
Well,
I do love a trailer.

416
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:02,895
Okay, let's stay
on schedule, people.

417
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,730
My kid's reading a poem
at school.

418
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,032
By the way,
your rack looks fantastic.

419
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:10,703
You seem like
a great dad.

420
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,772
DJ, is this
about last night,

421
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:14,006
'cause I wouldn't
wear a towel?

422
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,041
No.
No, we're good.

423
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,810
I don't wanna see that.
Bury her deep.

424
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,145
"Bury her deep"?

425
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,880
Did he just say,
"Bury her deep"?

426
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:23,015
Caroline, you need
to work back there.

427
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,884
Is this how Hollywood
treats women?

428
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,786
This is how Hollywood
treats everyone.

429
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:28,187
Everybody ready.

430
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:31,624
Max, if you do this,
you'll be getting paid for sex.

431
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,226
Well, it's about time.

432
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,728
Places, everyone.

433
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:39,131
You don't have to do this.
Chestnut is my horse.

434
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,400
And action!
Max, you're wiping the counter.

435
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:43,669
The killer comes in.
You look up.

436
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,004
Don't do it.

437
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,405
We can find money
somewhere else.

438
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,574
Cut!
Tom, I don't wanna see her.

439
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:50,409
- Caroline.
- Here they come.

440
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,778
Come on, everybody.
Back to one.

441
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,614
And action!
Max, you're wiping the counter.

442
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:58,217
The killer comes in.
You look up.

443
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:00,586
Pick up!

444
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,824
Max, seriously,
it's not worth it.

445
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,592
Cut!
Get her out of there.

446
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:08,894
Reset, reset.
Sorry about all that, people.

447
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,229
Now, let's give me
the bullet

448
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,932
I've been waiting for
my whole life.

449
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,968
I haven't felt
this unwanted

450
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,204
since I tried to teach
those inner-city school kids

451
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:19,338
how to knit.

452
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,840
Seriously Caroline,
you have to stay here,

453
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:22,074
away from the shot,

454
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,242
or neither of you
is gonna be paid.

455
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,811
Hey, Tom, you know
what this scene needs?

456
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:28,981
A little more cashier.

457
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:32,751
Oy, that crew is doing
a lot of damage to this diner.

458
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:36,655
Well, I'm doing some damage
to this fancy French water.

459
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:40,359
150 for the floor,
20 for the napkins they used,

460
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,598
and...

461
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,835
And 55 bucks for that
gorgeous picture of the city.

462
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:51,971
This is ridiculous.

463
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:54,740
How much longer do I have
to wait to be discovered?

464
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,775
Do what every other
American would do--

465
00:18:56,776 --> 00:18:59,745
skip the hard work
and put out a sex tape.

466
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:02,982
No, I'm gonna go out there.
Where's my lipstick?

467
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:06,252
Here, hold my Shake Weight.

468
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,721
And my Fresca.

469
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,824
Oh, hi.

470
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:14,894
Who do I talk to about
getting a part in this thing?

471
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:17,363
I mean, I already let the guy
who puts out the cookies

472
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,532
touch my boobs.

473
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,066
We don't have a guy
who puts out cookies.

474
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,801
Yo.

475
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:25,671
Okay, everybody ready!
Camera up!

476
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,673
Oh, he looks important.

477
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,041
- Oh, no, no! Stop, stop!
- No! Let go!

478
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,509
- Ooh!
- Not the blood switch!

479
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:35,881
Ahhh!

480
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:39,418
Someone shot Max!

481
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,421
Cut!
Tom, get rid of Max too.

482
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:44,123
Get me another girl.

483
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:45,691
Typical!

484
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:49,261
Shoot on my chest
and you're done with me.

485
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:55,668
Hi, you looking
for a new girl?

486
00:19:58,138 --> 00:19:59,471
Last time I looked
like this,

487
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:00,739
I was coming out
of an acid trip

488
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,109
and my friend Daniel
was missing.

489
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,477
I gotta admit,

490
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,147
getting shot felt
kinda gangsta waitress.

491
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:11,116
I'm like Notorious BLT.

492
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:13,085
So here's the deal.

493
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,286
We'll pay you
for the day yesterday,

494
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,922
but not for today
or for the featured extra.

495
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:19,625
- Say what?
- Not so fast, my brother.

496
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,494
Here is the latest tally
for my diner damage.

497
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,797
What's this last
$1,000 charge?

498
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,333
That is for the damage
done to Max and Caroline.

499
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:29,034
According
to crew scuttlebutt,

500
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,604
the director tried
some funny business last night.

501
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,871
This is not cool, dude.

502
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:35,574
It is most decidedly
not cool, pal.

503
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:38,410
So maybe there is someone
in a union I can talk to

504
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:40,279
about this particular
damage.

505
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,581
Not to mention the child
labor laws you violated

506
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,950
by working with Han.

507
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,486
Don't talk to anyone.
I'll get 'em paid.

508
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,188
This sucks.

509
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:50,923
I knew we should've
shot at a Denny's.

510
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,727
Han, that is the sweetest,
coolest thing

511
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:56,395
you just did for us.

512
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:59,264
It is, and Caroline is totally
gonna put out for you tonight.

513
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:01,000
That's kind of her thing now.

514
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,236
Well, I don't want anyone
to take advantage of you two.

515
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:05,804
You're my girls.

516
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:09,274
And tonight, on a very special
episode of <i>Funk and Skank,</i>

517
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:12,044
the cute, tiny Asian guy
turns out to be the girls' pimp,

518
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:15,447
and the copstitutes
are able to buy new horseshoes.

519
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,755
