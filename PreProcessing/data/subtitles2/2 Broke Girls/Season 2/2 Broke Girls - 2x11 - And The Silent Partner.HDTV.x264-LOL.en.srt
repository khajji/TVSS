'Cause I was slushy boy's bitch

157
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,807
for three weeks,
and I did things.

158
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,142
Look,
Max brought you cupcakes,

159
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:10,346
your favorite: Vanilla
with a bacon fat drizzle.

160
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,566
No, I can't eat
when I've been betrayed.

161
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,353
What kind again?

162
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:21,106
Sophie, I am patient man,
but I am also horny man.

163
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,609
Any idea when you will
snap out of this?

164
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,479
Oh, why don't you just unzip
and climb on top of me now

165
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,164
and get it over with?

166
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,166
- Oh, no.
- Well, we should be going.

167
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,035
No, girls, stay.

168
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,755
If she's not even going to
put up a fight, what's the fun?

169
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,674
Are you sure?

170
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:41,427
Bacon drizzle,
little bit of heaven.

171
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,512
No, I don't want them.

172
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:45,497
Okay,
let's put the cupcakes here,

173
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,299
in case
you change your mind.

174
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,019
- Is this a gun?
- Ooh!

175
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:53,856
Yes. I'm not going to
stab myself to death.

176
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:57,026
Do you know how much
this outfit costs?

177
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,010
Sophie, you're going to
get through this.

178
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,697
And by the way,
you look amazing in black.

179
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,234
Oh, well, no more
bright colors for me now.

180
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,286
I'm in mourning.

181
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:11,290
See?
Black bra, black garters,

182
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,592
and look,
black panties.

183
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:17,379
Um, you're not wearing
any panties.

184
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:20,031
I'm not?

185
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,417
Oh.

186
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,803
I'm sorry about
that wild mess down there.

187
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,891
Sophie, I feel bad
you got ripped off.

188
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:32,544
Here are all my tips
from tonight: $27.

189
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:35,263
For eight hours?

190
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,350
Oh, now,
I'm depressed for you.

191
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,969
You want to borrow my gun?

192
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,638
You know what? I think
you just need to eat something,

193
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,307
and pretty soon,
you'll be back to your old self:

194
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:49,310
A woman who gives gifts
and expects nothing in return,

195
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,997
'cause that's
what a gift is.

196
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,418
Sophie, is that
doing anything for you?

197
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,538
Yeah, well,
I'm not hating it.

198
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,758
Here, this soup
smells amazing.

199
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,043
Oh, no. I don't have
the energy to eat.

200
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,447
Sophie, open your mouth
and put this in.

201
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,634
Oh, come on.
Now you're as bad as Oleg.

202
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,869
There. Better?

203
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,855
That's cold.

204
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,809
Sophie, just say the word,
and I will rob a bank for you.

205
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,694
Sophie, I understand
you're hurting,

206
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,980
but we've already spent
most of the money on the shop,

207
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,532
and business
just isn't good.

208
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,786
It's not the money.
Everybody thinks it's the money.

209
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,320
It's more than that.

210
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,540
My lake house was my dream,
and I lost my dream.

211
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,875
Oh, thank God!

212
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,044
Well, I'm glad
that's cleared up.

213
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,712
Not about the money.

214
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,298
Max, come on, she's had a shock,
we should let her sleep.

215
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,668
You girls are so lucky.
You still have your dream.

216
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,304
Well, Sophie, what if you
were part of our dream?

217
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:50,806
I'm sorry?
Whose dream?

218
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,174
Our dream.

219
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,877
Your dream?
Where's that cupcake?

220
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,546
Look, Sophie's the only reason
we have a shop.

221
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,898
We should make her,
like, a partner.

222
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,234
Mmm! Partner!

223
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,352
But you and I
are already partners.

224
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,321
I feel like we're kind of
partnered out.

225
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,023
What about
a silent partner?

226
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,559
Mmm! Silent partner!
Yeah, I like that.

227
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,863
Mmm! I'm getting
my appetite back,

228
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,866
and also,
my sex drive.

229
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,087
Go or stay, girls.
Either way, I'm going in.

230
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:33,869
I'm sorry I said Sophie
could be part of the store.

231
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,005
I just felt bad for her,
lying there,

232
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:40,642
all in black, too sad
to even make her junk pretty.

233
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:44,163
It's fine. "Silent partner" is
just a figurehead role anyway,

234
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,699
and it's nice to know
you have such a big heart.

235
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,933
It's not my heart.

236
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,153
What I saw down there
changed me.

237
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,655
It looks like something
an animal built

238
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:56,058
to live in
for the winter.

239
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,784
Wait, what is
Sophie's chandelier doing here?

240
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,303
Is this the Polish version
of a home invasion?

241
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:11,273
They break in
and leave something tacky?

242
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,459
Good morning, partners.

243
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,597
I didn't know the dress code,
so I went business casual.

244
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:23,852
Look, the chandelier that
I bought for my lake house.

245
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:26,054
Oh, now our dreams
are together.

246
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:29,608
Sophie, it's not
the look we were going for.

247
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,446
Oh, I know.
Much better, right?

248
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:36,014
That is definitely
not our style.

249
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:39,968
It looks like a Tim Burton movie
just spit up in here.

250
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,720
I think
it's kind of pretty.

251
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,222
But what do I know?

252
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:46,558
I once spent my last 50 bucks
on a frog pinata.

253
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,760
Had to have it.

254
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:50,562
[Phone ringing]

255
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:52,314
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

256
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,950
Yes, we're
an upscale bakery, and--

257
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:57,319
Now, we sell hoagies.

258
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,289
Oh, no, no, no, sir,
we do not sell hoagies.

259
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,957
Yes, we do.

260
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,877
How many would you like?
Let me get a pen.

261
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,496
[Knocking at the door]

262
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:11,667
What's happening?

263
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:14,452
Are we finally
gonna trash Caroline?

264
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:15,804
No, I need your help.

265
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,339
I watched four chick flicks
back-to-back,

266
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:18,724
then I made a list
of possible ways

267
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:20,142
to tell Caroline
I love her.

268
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:24,096
I was gonna make more,
but I got my period.

269
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:29,401
Okay, run the choices
past me.

270
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:31,436
Whichever one makes me
want to hurl the most,

271
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:33,238
that's your winner.

272
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,357
I could play a song for her
outside of her apartment,

273
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:38,694
but keep in mind how hard it is
to find a boom box in 2012.

274
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,979
Yeah, plus, if you do that
outside our apartment,

275
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,648
you'll be shot.

276
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,766
By me.

277
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:47,953
Okay, what about
sharing cocoa and a hot dog

278
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,654
on the ice rink
in Central Park?

279
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:50,956
Yup, that's it.

280
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,374
Makes me
want to take my head off

281
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:53,625
and throw it
into the street.

282
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,961
Cool.
Oh, and, Max,

283
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:57,579
I think I'm the only
straight guy on earth

284
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,281
who knows the difference
between Dylan McDermott

285
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:02,801
and Dermott Mulroney,
and that, my friend, is love.

286
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,122
Oh, what's
that funky-ass smell?

287
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:10,692
Do they finally sell
pepperoni febreze?

288
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,261
Max, this already
isn't working.

289
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,847
The stinky salami,
the gaudy chandelier?

290
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,817
It's like a haunted Quiznos
in here.

291
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:21,953
Hey, I'm sending Oleg
to Queens

292
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,823
to pick up
a flat of Fresca. Yeah.

293
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,425
There's nothing better
with a hoagie

294
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,493
than an ice-cold Fresca.

295
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,029
That's what I wanted!

296
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,914
Look...

297
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,534
They'll go great
with the pickled eggs!

298
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,673
This just went from my dream
to a nightmare.

299
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,393
Oh, my God, Caroline!
It is you!

300
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,346
Stacy, no way! I haven't
seen you since graduation.

301
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,031
We went to Wharton together.

302
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,066
This girl is a genius.

303
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:52,934
- [Chuckles]
- Always top of the class.

304
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,519
So what are you
doing here?

305
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:57,389
Buying a cupcake on your way
to running the world?

306
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:59,241
No, I own this shop.

307
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:02,944
Oh. You own
this little cupcake shop?

308
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:06,081
And many other
bigger shops.

309
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,333
This is our
new Williamsburg location.

310
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,452
And yes, I know,
the chandelier is all wrong.

311
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:12,170
I told the designer,
none of our

312
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:15,073
Pacific Northwest locations
will have the chandeliers.

313
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:18,710
Of course, you'd own
a cupcake empire at 25.

314
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:21,546
- Oh, and this is Max.
- Hi.

315
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:25,384
I just transferred
from our Boise location.

316
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:28,937
What's that horrible smell?

317
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:31,723
It's something called
a "hoagie."

318
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:34,476
The workers like them.
Right, Max?

319
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:39,431
<i>Si, gracias</i>
<i>por la</i> hoagie.

320
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,699
Well, I have to go.

321
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,767
I'm consulting upstairs
at BBD&L.

322
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,653
- Oh, upstairs. [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

323
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,455
Always knew
you'd land on your feet.

324
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:50,459
Let's go for drinks,
and you're paying, mogul.

325
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:55,163
I hope
she likes water.

326
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:58,250
Now what am I going to do?
Stacy's in the building.

327
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:01,052
Well, you could move to Narnia
and run that branch,

328
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:04,089
you pathological liar.

329
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:06,892
Max, this is not
how I want people to see me,

330
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:09,261
or smell me,
quite frankly.

331
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:11,629
We have to get rid
of the salami, the chandelier,

332
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:13,932
and the Sophie.
This is our dream, not hers.

333
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:15,817
Okay, fine,
I'll tell her.

334
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,237
Hey, Sophie,
can we talk to you?

335
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,939
Good news, girls.

336
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:24,025
Now we sell scratchers.

337
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,978
But I have
even a better idea.

338
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,782
You two should dress up
as big cupcakes

339
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:33,285
and pass out free samples.

340
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:38,790
Sophie, Max has something
she wants to say to you.

341
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,292
Wait.

342
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:43,512
Girls, I have something
to say first.

343
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:45,830
[Sighs]

344
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:50,835
Two days ago, I was
on the verge of suicide.

345
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:54,506
Yeah, seriously,
I hadn't eaten all afternoon.

346
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:58,176
But your generosity
with your dream

347
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:02,614
has given me a reason
to get up and get a wax.

348
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,366
Yeah.

349
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:09,154
Oh. Max, there was something
you wanted to say?

350
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:12,325
I was going to say--

351
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:17,715
[laughs]

352
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,215
You look delicious.

353
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,868
I look like
Honey Boo Boo's mom at the prom.

354
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,940
This is so humiliating.

355
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:35,392
[Scoffs]
Now I know how Tyra felt

356
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,978
when she went undercover
as that fat person.

357
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,147
Please tell me
this is our bottom.

358
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,616
Well, it's your bottom.
I went to happy hour once

359
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,618
and woke up naked
in the penguin habitat

360
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,853
at the Bronx zoo.

361
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,357
And I did things.

362
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,742
Hey, girls.

363
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:55,579
What are you two doing
just standing there?

364
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,965
God gave cupcakes legs
for a reason.

365
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,084
You need
to hit the streets,

366
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:05,472
shake your cake maker,
and show people your goods.

367
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,757
Hey, don't look at me,
it's vanilla.

368
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,559
I was looking forward
to going up

369
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,011
to complete strangers
on the street

370
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:14,347
and saying "eat me,"
but she won't leave.

371
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:17,684
Well, if you're not going to
go out and get the customers,

372
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,769
then I'll have to bring
the customers to you.

373
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:23,056
I gotta do everything
around here.

374
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,993
Seriously, I can't believe
we're just standing here

375
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:28,912
when we could be chasing
fat people down the street,

376
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,565
yelling, "you ate my brother!"

377
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,117
Look at you two.

378
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,286
What I wouldn't give
for a giant glass of milk.

379
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,671
- [Laughs]
- Look at you, though.

380
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:38,922
You look so cute.

381
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,240
No, don't look at me.

382
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,175
I'm totally embarrassed
in this thing.

383
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,844
Yes, she's cute
and embarrassed,

384
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:48,382
in a larger-than-life,
colorful, public setting.

385
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:50,867
Ah, right.

386
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,186
So, Caroline, listen,
I wanted to--

387
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:56,673
Look, girls,
some young professionals.

388
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,642
Oh, my God!
She's bringing Stacy.

389
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,694
She can't see me in this.
I was her valedictorian.

390
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,246
Take this.

391
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:09,953
Oh! Ugh!
Oh! Wait.

392
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,072
Help me up, Max!
Help me up!

393
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,576
Oh, great.
Now you're like my mom.

394
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,545
Here, give me
your left hand.

395
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:21,548
[Groans] Okay,
give me your right hand.

396
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,335
Get up! Get up!
Five second rule.

397
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:30,674
[Grunts]

398
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:35,762
Ugh! [Sighs]

399
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,631
What are you two
crazy cakes doing?

400
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,268
You lost your customers.
They ran away.

401
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,069
Oh, thank God.

402
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,604
Oh, I don't get it.

403
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:47,324
You won't push the hoagies
or the pickled eggs.

404
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,027
You must really
have a fear of success.

405
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,748
Well, at least
we missed Stacy.

406
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,367
Well, you know
what else you missed? Andy.

407
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,485
He was about to tell you
he loves you.

408
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,820
What?

409
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:03,156
Just now, in the hall,
and at the ice rink.

410
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,125
He's been trying
to tell you all week.

411
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,210
But I've been
too preoccupied with work,

412
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,348
like Sandra Bullock
in <i>The Proposal.</i>

413
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,050
So he was gonna tell me
at the ice rink?

414
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,552
The one in Central Park?

415
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,189
Yes, while having cocoa
and splitting a hot dog.

416
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,673
Oh, my God!

417
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:23,276
That's, like,
my dream "I love you" scenario.

418
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,729
Why didn't you
tell me sooner?

419
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,781
Because when it comes
to other people's

420
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:31,117
creepy love stuff, that's
when I'm a silent partner,

421
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,487
and you need to stop
with this creepy rom-com stuff.

422
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,989
Life isn't like a movie.

423
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:38,658
Sometimes you're not
a success right away

424
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,211
sometimes you have to just
eat it and be a cupcake,

425
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,696
and sometimes you have to
take your "I love you"

426
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:45,632
whichever way it comes.

427
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,584
You are so right.

428
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,502
I don't have to wait
for the moment to be perfect,

429
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:50,804
like it was
for Reese Witherspoon

430
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,973
in <i>Sweet Home Alabama.</i>

431
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,209
My life's
not a romantic comedy.

432
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,811
I can do it my own way.

433
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,681
Like Julia Roberts in
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding.</i>

434
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:10,690
Andy, it's me!

435
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:11,975
I'll be right out.

436
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,510
No, this can't wait
any longer.

437
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,645
I don't need
a big romantic comedy moment.

438
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,913
- No--
- [Grunts]

439
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,331
Oh!
Oh.

440
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,999
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was the office!

441
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,751
Not the office.

442
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,037
[Struggling]
I'm stuck.

443
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,623
Oh, I want to go,
but I can't.

444
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,259
And I'll never
be able to go again.

445
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,762
Well, I'm on the toilet
and you're in a cupcake.

446
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,099
Can't get creepier than this,
so, Caroline,

447
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,101
I love you.

448
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,738
I love you too.

449
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,442
Oh, please,
push me out.

450
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:51,431
How'd it go?
Was it romantic?

451
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,317
He told me he loved me
on the toilet.

452
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,070
Oh, man!
That's my dream scenario!

453
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,322
 Hey.

454
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,624
I'm only gonna do this
for an hour,

455
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,626
to show you
how it's done,

456
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,628
and then I'm out.

457
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,914
This is your dream,
not mine.

458
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,900
Cupcakes!
Free cupcakes!

459
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,269
Come on, get 'em!

460
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,457
Get 'em while they're hot!

461
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:21,826
