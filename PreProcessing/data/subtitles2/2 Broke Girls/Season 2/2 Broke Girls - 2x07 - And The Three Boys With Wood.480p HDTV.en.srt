Jacob, we're in New York.

160
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:56,554
Yeah, Jacob.
Listen to, uh--

161
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,557
- Jebediah.
- For real?

162
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,596
Did you see the size
of her nursers?

163
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:11,870
Those guys
are for real Amish.

164
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,039
I love the Amish culture.

165
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,473
You love
every culture.

166
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:18,410
You salute the flags
at IHOP when we walk by.

167
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,480
Oh, my God.
That's it.

168
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,216
Max, question.
What are the Amish known for?

169
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,419
Oh, no.
It's sixth grade all over again.

170
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,054
Just give me an "F"
and move on.

171
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,756
Barns.
They build barns, and we--

172
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,858
We need a barn
for Chestnut.

173
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,927
Come on.
And let me do the talking.

174
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,363
I am very good
at manipulating young boys.

175
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:40,231
I once got a ten-year-old
I was babysitting

176
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,600
to buy me a box of Pop-Tarts
with his allowance.

177
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:53,780
So this is our place.
Not much, but--

178
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:56,649
You have so many possessions.
Are you rich, ma'am?

179
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,319
Yes.

180
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,887
And I have to say,
this "ma'am" thing

181
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:04,157
is still working
for me.

182
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:06,326
Um, okay, Jacob.
That's enough with the lights.

183
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,562
There will be plenty of time for
fun with electricity tomorrow,

184
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:10,963
but it's late.

185
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:12,832
Let's discuss
sleeping arrangements.

186
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,167
You two can sleep out here,

187
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:15,335
and Max and I
will sleep in her bed.

188
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,436
Does that work for you?

189
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,737
Both: Okay.

190
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:19,839
Oh, sorry.
I left my bra.

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,108
Your--
your b-b-bra?

192
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:23,910
Jacob, stop acting
like a child.

193
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:24,911
I'm sorry about him.

194
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:25,978
Don't be.

195
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,113
At least it was her bra.

196
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,819
Mine would have killed
the kid.

197
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,287
So I was thinking
we could drive our truck

198
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:35,421
to my Uncle's lumberyard
in the morning

199
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,156
and get the wood
for the barn.

200
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,792
Okay, but there seems to be
plenty of wood right here.

201
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:41,063
Oh, hello.

202
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,931
Don't be embarrassed,
Jacob.

203
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:47,000
It's perfectly natural when
you're exposed to new things.

204
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,436
The first time I saw a picture
of those fat twins on scooters,

205
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,806
I was hard
for days.

206
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,708
Why don't you two go outside
and play with the horse?

207
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,110
Both: Okay.

208
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,945
And thank you for letting us
stay at your place.

209
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,114
Your home is dope.

210
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,182
You don't even know
what that means, Jebediah.

211
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:05,918
It's hipster talk, Jacob,
and it's awesome.

212
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,190
Are we sure
this is a good idea?

213
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,725
You saw how turned on
he was.

214
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:16,062
He was practically
raising a barn in his pants.

215
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,731
We're fine,
they're fine.

216
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,233
Just a typical male reaction

217
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,735
to a couple of hot cougars
like us.

218
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,372
Ra.
Rawr.

219
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,641
You know what isn't
a typical male reaction?

220
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:31,077
Not calling or texting
a girl you're interested in.

221
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:32,812
Well, why don't you
just text Andy, then?

222
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,480
What should I text?

223
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:37,250
"Why so gay,
question mark"?

224
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,851
I don't know.

225
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:40,553
The only thing
I've ever texted to a guy is,

226
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:44,824
"there's a cop behind you,
walk past me."

227
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,259
Just say "hey."

228
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,029
Okay.
I can do that.

229
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,531
"Hey."

230
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:56,102
Huh, it autocorrected
to "gay."

231
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,871
Even the phone's
getting that vibe.

232
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:00,840
There, sent it.
"Hey."

233
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,608
Do you think
I could grab a beer?

234
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:03,943
- Yes.
- No.

235
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,846
Look, they're working
for us for free.

236
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,882
- One beer each.
- Awesome, awesome, awesome.

237
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:12,452
Max, you can't give
underage kids beer in our home.

238
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,623
Why?
Isn't that what love is?

239
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,859
Jebediah,
beer is the Devil's saliva.

[Knock at door]

after midnight in Williamsburg?

00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,631
Where is this William?

243
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:27,867
I'd like to compliment him
on his burg.

244
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:31,537
Hi, girls, I just
came down for a cupcake--

245
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:34,640
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

246
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:37,310
Hold on.

247

Who are the two cute puppies
in the kitchen?

Look at you two.

249
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,884
You are
the cutest little things.

250
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,085
Yes, you are--

251
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,855
Ooh, and this one
has an erection.

252
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:57,096
Jacob, don't look
directly at her.

253
00:10:57,097 --> 00:11:00,299
She's like an eclipse
with boobs.

254
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,101
Sorry, girls.

255
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,670
I didn't mean to interrupt
your lovers' session.

256
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:07,173
Sophie, they're just here
to build a barn for Chestnut.

257
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:11,410
Oh, sure.
Wink, wink.

258
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,946
"Building a barn," is that
what we're calling it now?

259
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,581
Wink, wink.

260
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,683
Caroline's telling
the truth, Sophie.

261
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,085
It's strictly business.

262
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:23,022
Oh, so you're paying
for them?

263
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:27,293
Okay.
Ooh la la.

264
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:28,828
How much do they cost?

265
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:31,697
Because, yeah,
I also need a barn.

to play with the puppies.

It's very late.

271
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:42,608
You can come back
in the morning.

272
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,176
Oh.

273
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:48,182
This is like when they cancelled
Christmas in my village.

I wasn't sure what it meant,
but I immediately got tested.

Yep, Chestnut, pretty soon
you'll be safe and sound,

with a roof over your head,

Although
it hasn't for me,

476
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,950
so maybe that only applies
to questioning teens.

477
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:42,352
In short, there's really
no point to anything,

478
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,421
but sometimes, you get
to eat candy or have sex,

479
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:46,225
and that's
when it all feels right.

Oh, no.

Caroline, the cat.

483
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,470
I'm on my own.
Fine.

484
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:04,241
Oh, no, you bastard,
not tonight.

485
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:06,476
It is not going down
tonight.

[Cat hisses]

All right,
you win this one.
