1
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:05,357
Oh, my God!
We have customers?

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,342
What's going on?

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:09,127
Why are there
so many hipsters here?

4
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:10,679
Are we selling stupid hats
and telling them

5
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:13,632
they're more talented
than they actually are?

6
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:16,967
No, that's already a store.
It's called "Fedorable."

7
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:21,056
You've been working so hard
to get us customers in,

8
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:22,858
I wanted to contribute
by finding a way

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,226
to get in
the neighborhood hipsters.

10
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:26,228
So... Here's our new flyer.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,863
You made up a new flyer

12
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,764
without talking to me
about it first?

13
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,901
I renamed all the cupcakes
after people from the '90s!

14
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:34,703
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

15
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:37,072
We've got
all your flavor flavs."

16
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,791
Hipsters love '90s nostalgia
more than they love

17
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:41,827
pretending not
to love anything.

18
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,047
"Come in and lick a Beavis.

19
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,282
Eat a Butt-head."

20
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,617
The pistachio is now called
the Dennis Rodman

21
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,055
because it's such
a dumbass flavor.

22
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:55,674
Cute. Wait, what's going on
over there?

23
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,309
Why are all those cupcakes
smashed?

24
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:59,811
Those are
the Nancy Kerrigans.

25
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,730
I don't know
if it's in good taste

26
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,482
to make fun
of her personal tragedy.

27
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:06,652
- I sold eight of them.
- Screw her, you're a genius!

28
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:08,520
Ooh, ooh,
can I name one?

29
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:11,855
How 'bout we call the day-olds
the Hugh Hefners?

30
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:15,694
That's not '90s.

31
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:19,029
He's in his 90s,
and he's stale and hard.

32
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:22,200
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

35
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,845
Can I get
a Jonathan Taylor Thomas to go

36
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,563
and two of the Spice Girls?

37
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,633
Any one but "Baby."

38
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,151
Sure.

39
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:46,270
Dude, you should come
to the '90s trivia contest

40
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,072
every Monday at the Bar Bar.

41
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,491
You could win, like,
big money.

42
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:53,027
Yeah, and then I could pay
for the lobotomy I'd need

43
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,495
to forget
that I ever participated

44
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:56,497
in a hipster contest
in a bar.

45
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:59,832
Cute hat.
You're very talented.

46
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,402
I'm putting this flyer up
in the window.

47
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,242
Oh, look,
there's a street performer

48
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:10,177
trying to get people to dance
with his marionette

49
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,712
outside our shop.

50
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,631
Uhoh, not cool!

51
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,766
No hipster wants to crump
with a puppet.

52
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:19,101
See, he just
chased them away.

53
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,522
We'll just ask him to move,
but we have to be nice.

54
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,191
Nice? Nice... Oh, yeah,
that's the thing you are

55
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,093
to the welfare lady
while your mom's in the bedroom

56
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:29,428
hiding the new TV.

57
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,403
Hi, how are you?
We own this cupcake--

58
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,738
Shh!
Not while he's dancing.

59
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:50,049
Oh, I'm sorry, would you
like me to wait?

60
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:54,505
Oh, this dude's
a serial killer.

61
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,038
Uh... Oh.
Uh...

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,373
Do you want me to...

63
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,999
Yup, total serial killer.

64
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,435
Just a matter of time
till we're hung on strings

65
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:44,770
in his basement.

66
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:49,675
And I probably just got
puppet herpes.

67
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,679
Well, I hope
you enjoyed your kiss

68
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,567
with charming Pierre.

69
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,987
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

70
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,322
Oh, Pierre's a prostitute?

71
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,395
It's a little weird for him
to do it out in the open,

72
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:11,081
but if he can't afford a car,
he can't afford a car.

73
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,416
Oh, you're one of those--
a woman without <i>wonder.</i>

74
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,239
Not true.
In fact, I'm <i>wondering</i>

75
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,925
how you manage
to pay rent.

76
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,377
Okay, could you two
just move along?

77
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,412
I have another show
in five minutes.

78
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:27,264
That was a show?

79
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,850
Look, you can't do
your little skits here.

80
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,468
She doesn't mean
to be negative.

81
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,271
She's right. I was planning
to be all positive

82
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,440
till your doll
raped her leg.

83
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,775
Pierre is not a doll, okay?
He is a marionette.

84
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:43,695
Hand-carved by me.
And I don't do "skits," okay?

85
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,151
I received a national endowment
for my work.

86
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:51,154
What? The government
pays for stuff like this,

87
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,207
and I can't get
my back tooth fixed?

88
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,326
Well, I, for one,
really appreciate

89
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,794
the art of puppetry.

90
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:01,129
I can tell you do, and...
So can Pierre.

91
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,885
You know, he doesn't
just approach anybody.

92
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:08,220
I'm Caroline. This is Max.
And you are?

93
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:12,140
My stage name is
J. Petto.

94
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:15,560
Oh, so cute. Geppetto,
like Pinocchio's father.

95
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,898
No, it's "J," period,
"Petto."

96
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,569
Disney owns the rights
to the name Geppetto,

97
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:25,904
so once again, the poor,
starving artist gets screwed!

98
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,742
So sad.
Can you move?

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,363
See, this is
our cupcake shop,

100
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,915
and you're blocking
the entrance.

101
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,816
Uh, this is
a public space,

102
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:39,252
and I know my rights.

103
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:41,121
Showtime!

104
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,960
I was trying
to be nice,

105
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,879
but you are the rudest puppeteer
I've ever met.

106
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,547
And I'm including
Shari Lewis,

107
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,766
who told my father to shove it
on my fifth birthday!

108
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,101
Let's go, Max.

109
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:59,504
Hey... Doll man.

110
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,775
You don't want to mess
with us.

111
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,677
I make one call
to the cops,

112
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,812
they do a background check,
and I'm pretty sure you'd go

113
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:09,147
from "J. Petto"
to "J. Petto-phile."

114
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:14,488
Miss, I dropped
my David Hasselhoff.

115
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,823
Well, it's not the first time
he's been on the floor.

116
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,993
Hey, you can't talk
to me like that.

117
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,629
I studied puppetry in Paris
at the Palais--

118
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,132
Aah!

119
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,467
Oh, my God,
he slipped on David Hasselhoff!

120
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,537
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,922
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

122
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,208
I'm just
a little embarrassed.

123
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,543
Oh, no, no.
I landed on Pierre!

124
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:40,764
Pierre?

125
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,432
Here, have a seat.

126
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:45,318
Would either of you like
a coffee or a free cupcake?

127
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,653
No, I'm just gonna
pack up and go. Thank you.

128
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,274
Come back anytime
for a free cupcake.

129
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,393
But no need
to bring your dolls.

130
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,728
They're not dolls!
I'm a man!

131
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,911
It's crazy how many hipsters

132
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:11,579
came into our shop today
from our new flyers.

133
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,414
We ran completely out of all

134
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,717
the butterfinger Buttafuocos,
the Joeys,

135
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,052
and even the Mary Jos, which
I did not think would sell.

136
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,590
I reworked
the smashed Nancy Kerrigans

137
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:25,042
and called it
the Mary Jo.

138
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,377
Oh, girls,
I'm so happy for you.

139
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,931
You know, I remember
when my business

140
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,067
first started to take off.

141
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,519
The first thing I did was
to buy the little village

142
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,354
that I grew up in

143
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,689
and then burn it
to the ground!

144
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,194
I was just so angry

145
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,247
they wouldn't let me be
a cheerleader.

146
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:48,833
No, baby, that was
the movie <i>Carrie.</i>

147
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,619
You fell asleep
watching it last night.

148
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:55,754
Oh. Yeah, I gotta stop
watching movies late at night.

149
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,208
Once, for a whole year,

150
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,543
I thought <i>I</i> framed
Roger Rabbit.

151
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,436
I'm looking for the owners
of Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

152
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,889
Oh, that's me.
Wow, word is really spreading.

153
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,890
How can I help you?

154
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,558
You've been served.

155
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,144
Max, I just got served.

156
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:20,479
Did he go after your bangs?
'Cause that's where I'd start.

157
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,116
This is a lawsuit.

158
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,819
It says, "Max's Homemade
Cupcakes is being sued

159
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:27,454
"for injuries sustained
in our shop by Myron Shales,

160
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:29,606
a.K.A. 'J. Petto.'"

161
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,441
Max, it's th puppet guy.

162
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,210
He's suing <i>us?</i>

163
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,329
We should be suing him
for gross...

164
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,281
I don't know
what the legal words are

165
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,300
but just for being gross.

166
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:40,885
We can't afford
to be sued.

167
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,636
We can't even afford the lawyer
on those bus ads

168
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,472
who has a gavel in one hand
and a chicken in the other.

169
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:48,807
I hope everything
was satisfactory.

170
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,345
Can I get you ladies
anything else...

171
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:54,464
Like a strong work ethic?

172
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,767
Han, it's not funny.
We're being sued.

173
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,602
Okay, let me see those.

174
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,904
I studied law in Korea,

175
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,805
but I never made it
through graduation.

176
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,691
I realized
it wasn't my passion,

177
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,660
and I pulled out.

178
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,148
Did they know it was in?

179
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,483
Let's see... Uh-huh...
Uh-huh.

180
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,204
Yeah, you're being sued.

181
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,539
What law school did you go to,
Cal State-the-obvious?

182
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,677
Did you graduate
magna come rarely?

183
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:28,514
I told you,
I pulled out.

184
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,853
But don't worry,
accidents like this happen

185
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:34,305
in stores all the time.

186
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,774
That's why all businesses
have insurance.

187
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,109
Well, not all businesses.

188
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,180
How could you not
have insurance?

189
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,015
You need to get protection.

190
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,350
And I'm not talking
about condoms.

191
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,287
We're not idiots, Han.

192
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,622
We had
the insurance discussion.

193
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,190
I was like,
"Max, we need insurance."

194
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,541
And she was like,
"Do we have any money?"

195
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,043
And I was like, "No."
And she was like,

196
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,328
"What are the chances
something will happen?"

197
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,298
And I was like, "A million to one."
And she was like, "I like those odds.

198
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,882
Let's go get gummi bears."
And I was like, "Okay."

199
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,300
But we'll talk about this
at another time."

200
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,635
And here we are
talking about it now.

201
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,257
Remember,
we have no choice.

202
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,977
We have to get him
to drop this lawsuit.

203
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,479
Okay, 3B, here. This is
the puppet guy's apartment.

204
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,848
You say puppet guy,
I say serial killer.

205
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,150
You say apartment,
I say the brightest dot

206
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,102
on the "Megan's law" website.

207
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,571
Max, that is not charming.
Stay on message.

208
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:27,906
- We're charming, we're sorry...
- We're drunk. Well, I am.

209
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,228
How else do you think I'm gonna
pull off charming?

210
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,279
Let's just get in and out
of there.

211
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,580
That puppet creeped me out.

212
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,415
I don't want to have
to see it again.

213
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,507
Oh, I am not drunk enough
for this.

214
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,010
I've never been
drunk enough for this.

215
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,929
Is J. Petto home?

216
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:56,971
I'm kind of surprised.

217
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,273
I did not think
he'd have a girlfriend.

218
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,976
Hello.

219
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:05,311
Well, I hope you enjoyed
meeting Yvette.

220
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:07,531
She plays the lute,
you know.

221
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,866
Oh, yes,
she was very charming.

222
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,154
And small. She must make
your penis look huge.

223
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,489
I'm sorry?

224
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,160
Charming, Max, charming.

225
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:22,880
Hi, we just stopped by
to bring you some cupcakes.

226
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,781
We feel so bad
about what happened.

227
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,283
Can we come in
for a minute?

228
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,169
Um, well, I wasn't
expecting company,

229
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,255
but come in.

230
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,007
We're all just hangin' out.

231
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,342
Oh, oh, this isn't weird.
This isn't weird at all.

232
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,447
It's like we're
in a dead body car wash.

233
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,983
I had a nightmare that I had
a nightmare like this once.

234
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,322
Just so you know,

235
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:51,275
I'm not allowed to talk
about the lawsuit.

236
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,693
Well, I'm not
allowed to talk

237
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,446
about how I really feel
right now.

238
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,865
Speaking of the lawsuit,
you seem well--

239
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,700
you know, physically--
which is great,

240
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,485
because the suit said
you had a shattered arm

241
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,087
and a broken hip.

242
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,172
Oh, yeah,
I'm not suing you

243
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,374
for <i>my</i> shattered arm
and hip.

244
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,709
It's--
it's for Pierre's.

245
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,836
I crushed his little body
when I fell.

246
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:22,339
He must have thrown himself
under my body

247
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,674
to protect my fall.

248
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,511
Dexter, party of one.

249
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:34,035
I have to rotate his arm
and hold it every 15 minutes

250
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:36,019
to get his full range
of motion back.

251
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,354
That's what the sling's about.
I know he's not alive.

252
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:43,409
Do you?

253
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,296
We're very sorry
for his injury,

254
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,714
but this is absurd.

255
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,883
You can't sue us
because your puppet broke.

256
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,869
Yes, I can.
This puppet is my livelihood,

257
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,505
and he's heavily insured.

258
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,057
Great, the puppet has
insurance, and we don't.

259
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,708
- Max!
- What?

260
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,127
You don't have insurance?

261
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,429
You have a business
but no insurance?

262
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:05,764
Look, we can't go to court.
It would wreck us.

263
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,651
Can we leave the lawyers
out of this

264
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,486
and come up
with a more creative solution?

265
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,938
I mean,
you're clearly creative.

266
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,690
Look, you even made
a skeleton king.

267
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,392
That's not
a skeleton king.

268
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,495
That's Pazuzu,
prince of darkness.

269
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,031
Let me just
put this out there

270
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,066
because we should really
move things along,

271
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,452
and also, I'm afraid.

272
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:27,621
How much is it gonna take
to make this go away?

273
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,206
Do you want to take
a second to consult

274
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,290
with one of your roommates?

275
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,759
I think I saw
a lawyer doll.

276
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:36,094
He is not a lawyer.
He is a maitre d'.

277
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,748
And a damn good one!

278
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,969
You women
just don't get it.

279
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,921
This is why I broke up
with my Toronto-based girlfriend

280
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,807
over Skype.

281
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,526
Right?

282
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,529
$1,000 by Monday.

283
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,231
But if she makes
another comment

284
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,566
about my intricate, hand-carved
marionettes being dolls...

285
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,703
It goes up.

286
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,325
Fine, $1,000
and no strings.

287
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,660
- Except for the ones on all--
- Max, don't say it!

288
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,468
<i>Valley Of The Dolls,</i>
<i>Return To The Valley Of The Dolls,</i>

289
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,119
<i>Chucky, Bride Of Chucky,</i>
<i>Hello Dolly,</i> Dollywood,

290
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,454
and the Dalai Lama!

291
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,310
Those are the things
I was holding in.

292
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,645
Oh, wait--
Doll and Oates!

293
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,234
Now what? How are we gonna get
1,000 extra dollars by Monday?

294
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,938
Wait, Max, we can go
to that bar

295
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,690
and exploit
your special gifts.

296
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:40,025
If I have to strip,
I have to strip.

297
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,447
Not that kind of bar,
the hipster trivia bar.

298
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,915
Can't I just strip?

299
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,200
At least I'd still have
my dignity.

300
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,264
It's all here. $1,000.

301
00:14:57,516 --> 00:15:00,267
So that's it.
No more lawsuit.

302
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,718
Actually, that's not it.

303
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,854
As it turns out,
we're gonna need 500 more.

304
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:06,807
For what? Did your dues
for the serial killer's union

305
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,142
and the pedophile guild come up
at the same time this year?

306
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,697
Pierre's in crisis!

307
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:17,032
But his psychiatrist could
tell you more about that.

308
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,786
If there's a psychiatrist
in this apartment

309
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:23,121
who hasn't locked him up,
I don't trust his opinion.

310
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:27,192
I'm Dr. Pangloss.

311
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,962
Pierre broke more than his hip
in your cupcake shop.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,333
He broke his spirit.

313
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:38,887
He lost his <i>dream!</i>

314
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:42,757
He no longer wants
to perform.

315
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,047
This is
where he cuts us in half

316
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,816
and sews my top
to your bottom.

317
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,569
On the plus side,
we'd look amazing.

318
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,104
Yeah, well, you heard it.

319
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,639
Pierre's ready
to give up his art,

320
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:58,908
and he needs
a little more money.

321
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,528
Forget it, puppet nuts.
We don't have $500.

322
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,530
We don't have 500 anything.

323
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,832
Well, think about it.

324
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:08,501
That's my tea kettle.
Yvette!

325
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:10,120
Uhh! I'll do it.

326
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:13,455
I'm not so sure the hostility
is quite working,

327
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,091
so why don't you
go wait in the hall?

328
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,926
And I'll try to talk
some sense into him alone.

329
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,795
You are the only person
in the world

330
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,598
who would insist
on being alone with this man,

331
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,599
but okay.

332
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:25,668
Please just listen.
We are broke.

333
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,771
To get any more money,
we'd have to strip.

334
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:31,057
Well, Gigi and Lana
started off as strippers,

335
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,392
and now they're
in the Folies Bergere, so...

336
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:38,148
You know, even
for a middle-aged puppeteer,

337
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,182
you're a freak.

338
00:16:39,484 --> 00:16:42,517
See you in court!

339
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:45,405
Nothing.
He's gonna sue us,

340
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,323
and we have no other tricks
up our sleeve.

341
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:50,658
Well, maybe not my sleeve,
but how about my <i>coat?</i>

342
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:54,629
- Pierre?
- Right there.

343
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,476
I'm sorry,
we're not open today.

344
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:09,811
I know you took him.
Give me back Pierre!

345
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:11,648
We're not open.

346
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,483
We've had
a terrible tragedy.

347
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:15,602
Well, not us,
but a new friend of ours

348
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:18,937
had a gruesome accident,
and we are just devastated.

349
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,741
You wouldn't be
that cruel.

350
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:24,194
Relax, I could never be
that cruel.

351
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:25,195
But Max could.

352
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:28,530
Well, well, well.

353
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:33,951
Look who it is, Pierre,
your lover, J. Petto!

354
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:38,339
He's not gay.

355
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,409
He had a girlfriend
named Lulu.

356
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:43,263
She was a--she was a courtesan
in the court of a French king.

357
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,348
They broke up
over a brief flirtation she had

358
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,350
with Yvette.

359
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:50,653
And I know
they're not alive!

360
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:53,988
Now, what do you say we stick
to the original no-strings deal?

361
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,392
'Cause if you don't,
Max will show you

362
00:17:56,394 --> 00:17:59,727
what "no strings"
really means.

363
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,031
Do it! Go!
Bring it!

364
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,366
I can always re-string him.
I'm a master of my craft.

365
00:18:06,304 --> 00:18:08,788
Yes, we thought
you'd say that.

366
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,874
So you leave us no choice.
Max...

367
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,026
What? I--

368
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,794
I'm not changing my mind.

369
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:18,129
And I'm coming back
with the police.

370
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:22,135
Oh, I wouldn't get
the cops involved...

371
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,087
Now that your boy here
is in a...

372
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:27,422
Compromising situation!

373
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,073
How dare you!

374
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,611
And she does not like
the feel of a condom!

375
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,868
You two are sick!

376
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,704
Hey, we don't judge.

377
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,006
We think whatever
two consenting dolls,

378
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:03,341
or maybe <i>three</i>
consenting dolls do--

379
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,179
and it's gonna be bad

380
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:09,514
'cause he's a grower,
not a shower.

381
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:17,557
And once a few of these pics
are posted online,

382
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,509
there goes your children's
party business.

383
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:23,844
Now, call it quits,
and you can delete these pics.

384
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:26,733
Fine. Yes. Okay, you win.
You win. You win.

385
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:29,452
Oh, we're not falling
for your word again.

386
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,571
If you want
your doll back--

387
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,906
For the last time,
he is not a doll!

388
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,210
Bring us
a notarized letter saying

389
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:38,861
you release
Max's Homemade Cupcakes

390
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,630
of all further legal action,

391
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:42,966
and we'll give you back Pierre,
perfectly intact.

392
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:46,002
Minus his virginity,
of course.

393
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:49,337
But don't worry,
you'll still have yours.

394
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:53,593
Okay, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

395
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:56,928
Ugh, 30 years in
the cutthroat world of puppets,

396
00:19:57,232 --> 00:20:00,565
and I'm undone
by two crazy cupcake bitches!

397
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,492
Did you hear that?
30 years?

398
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:12,827
30 years of following his dream,
and he's still broke?

399
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:14,280
Is that gonna be us, Max?

400
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,666
Is our dream just as stupid
as puppets?

401
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:19,118
Sorry, Pierre,
I forgot you were here.

402
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,736
He's sound asleep.

403
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:23,206
Three-ways really
take it out of you.

404
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,791
Here, dress her.
She has to get a cab.

405
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,710
She'd rather sleep
in her own bed.

406
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,515
And do you know why we're
not gonna turn into him?

407
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:34,717
Because 30 years ago,
when J. Petto said,

408
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,269
"I'm gonna be
a puppeteer,"

409
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,937
he didn't have a best friend
to tell him,

410
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,690
"You shouldn't do that.
It's a stupid idea."

411
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,425
And unlike him,
you have me to tell you

412
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,860
when it's a stupid idea.

413
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:45,695
And I have you to tell me
not to mace myself,

414
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,931
no matter how bad
I want to know how it feels.

415
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:51,451
So the cupcake shop
isn't a stupid idea?

416
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:53,619
No. And it's actually starting
to take off.

417
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,605
'Cause no one embraces
a stupid idea like a hipster.

418
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:59,042
But, Max,
we do need insurance.

419
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:01,160
- But do we have the money?
- No.

420
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:02,580
What are the chances
someone else is gonna fall?

421
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:03,797
A million to one.

422
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,049
I like those odds.

423
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:08,334
You know, this is
a really cute dress.

424
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:09,502
Forget the dress.

425
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,671
Look at his cute pants.

426
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:14,724
We really should give them
to Han.

427
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:20,974
