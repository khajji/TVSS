1
00:00:01,036 --> 00:00:02,737
Well, here it is.
My last tip.

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:04,138
Only $2.

3
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:05,756
And to think,
I held in a fart

4
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,891
for those cheap bastards.

5
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:09,593
This night sucks.

6
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:10,761
We don't even have enough

7
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:12,363
to buy supplies
for tomorrow.

8
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,597
We'll just have to go
to that store

9
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:16,634
where everything's free.

10
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:19,637
Oh, good.
They're open.

11
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:20,971
And we have to sneak
all this stuff out.

12
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:22,906
Han's staying late
to do inventory.

13
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:25,976
Damn it, why does he always
have to be so Asian?

14
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,611
Let's see, what do we need
for our cupcake shop?

15
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,381
Eggs, sugar--
A stripper pole?

16
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:32,416
Do you want to make money
or not?

17
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,218
How are we gonna hide
these eggs?

18
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,220
You could put some of those
"Grade A large"

19
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,489
where there's
"Grade A itty-bitties."

20
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,592
Rude,
but I don't hate it.

21
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:44,228
I can probably fit
four to six in each.

22
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,729
So positive!

23
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,033
I love that you're a "cup's
half full" kind of person.

24
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,005
So come here often?

25
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,841
This is my first time.

26
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,644
- Well, you're very pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

27
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:03,013
Heads up.
Han's coming your way.

28
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:04,648
Should I fake a stroke?

29
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:07,384
And P.S., if I don't get up
in three minutes,

30
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:09,286
it's a real one.

31
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,988
No,
I'll deal with him.

32
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,358
You keep going.

33
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:20,130
Keep it up,
and we'll finally have

34
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,466
an answer to the question
"What comes first?

35
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:25,536
The chicken or the Oleg?"

36
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,973
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

37
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:34,942

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

39
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,391
Here you go.

40
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:46,860
I just found
the greatest thing online.

41
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,562
The ultrasound
of the Kim and Kanye baby

42
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:50,163
where someone photoshopped
a "666"

43
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,966
on its little baby butt?

44
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,801
Wait, this kid's
half Kardashian.

45
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:56,503
Its big baby butt.

46
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,639
Wow, that baby's already
famous for doing nothing...

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,973
Just like its mom.

48
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,579
No, what I found is a site
where we can apply

49
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,980
for a small business grant.

50
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:09,382
There's a couple of categories:
Women-owned business--

51
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:10,851
No thanks.
I've been to jail.

52
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:13,820
I was already owned
by a woman.

53
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,723
There's also
a minority-owned category.

54
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:17,724
You don't know
who your father is,

55
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:18,859
and you do have
an exotic look.

56
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,727
Any chance he could be
Native American?

57
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,462
Yes, in fact,
I think his name

58
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,698
was Chief Running Away.

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,333
Wait.

60
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,134
Maybe we don't even
need your father.

61
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,436
We are white,

62
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,137
which according to
the last presidential election,

63
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:33,073
is the new minority.

64
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:36,109
So now all we need is
a letter of recommendation

65
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,278
from someone who owns
another start-up business.

66
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,746
I was thinking
of a recommendation

67
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,548
from Candy Andy's
Sweets and Treats.

68
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,617
I've already written it,
so he just has to sign it.

69
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,620
Will you ask Andy?
I can't, he's my ex.

70
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,787
And I'm saving up my favor

71
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:49,789
for a booty call
on a cold night.

72
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,025
I hate asking men
for things.

73
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:55,359
Favors, last names, to stop.

74
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:59,599
Excuse me, could I get
some more Sweet'n Low?

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,667
Why don't you look
in your purse?

76
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:01,968
It's where I saw you
put them.

77
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,503
I'm so embarrassed.

78
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,704
Don't be.

79
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:07,974
I wasn't when I stole them
last night.

80
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,175
What did Andy say?

81
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:10,176
He's gone.

82
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:11,711
- For lunch?
- Forever.

83
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:12,991
The man is gone.

84
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,251
His store is empty.

85
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:20,587
Oh, my God,
this is so sad.

86
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:23,921
I know.
There goes the candy.

87
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,027
And my booty call.

88
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:30,361
- He didn't even leave a note?
- Or a razzle?

89
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:32,399
Forget the candy.

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,967
Are we not gonna talk about
the fact

91
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,670
that my ex-boyfriend left
without so much as a peep?

92
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:40,004
Great.
Now I want peeps.

93
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:41,207
Hey, Max.

94
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,076
Is today the day
we're gonna get married?

95
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,244
Sure, Amir.

96
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:45,845
'Cause my dream in life
is to be detained

97
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:49,179
for four hours
on our honeymoon flight.

98
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:53,053
Max, you do know I was born
in this country, right?

99
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,688
You were born here?
How old are you?

100
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,022
About <i>Zero Dark Thirty?</i>

101
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:01,725
Yeah, you were born
in a Walmart, right?

102
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:03,763
Where do you think
the expression

103
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,733
"Clean up on aisle 12"
comes from?

104
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,001
Hey, Caroline,

105
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,469
you bummed you drove
your boyfriend out of town?

106
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,705
For the record,
I did not chase Andy away.

107
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:13,540
We ended
our relationship well.

108
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,542
Right, that's why
I helped him move out

109
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:16,843
in the middle
of the night.

110
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:19,746
Man, you messed that up.
So self-involved.

111
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:22,482
Wow.
Coming in a little hot, Amir.

112
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:23,917
Yeah, guns ablazin'.

113
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,886
If I was allowed
to carry them.

114
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:30,056
Oh, Amir.
You're the bomb.

115
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:31,424
Look at us.

116
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:34,361
We're like <i>Homeland,</i>
if it was a rom-com.

117
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:42,553
You don't have to read it, Han.

118
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,188
It's just a standard letter
of recommendation.

119
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,223
Don't be a bitch.
Just sign it.

120
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:48,792
I'm not comfortable
putting my name

121
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,461
on a document
I haven't read.

122
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:51,995
I understand,
but don't be a bitch.

123
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,697
Just sign it.

124
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,066
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes is

125
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,635
an up-and-coming
powerhouse business."

126
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:00,270
I can't sign this.

127
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:03,604
This has more lies
than my OKCupid profile.

128
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:07,208
Don't be a bitch.
Just sign it.

129
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:09,480
That one's on me, girls.

130
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,050
If I sign this, it's lying.
I could get deported.

131
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:16,384
And I'm one home inspection away
from a poodle adoption.

132
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:20,754
A poodle? That's cool.
You can share sweaters.

133
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:22,576
Hurry up, bitch.

134
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:24,578
The deadline
to mail that is tonight.

135
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,080
Well, if you just wanted
to steamroll someone,

136
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:29,416
why didn't you get your
boyfriend, Andy, to sign it?

137
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,450
They split.

138
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,918
He left last night
without a peep.

139
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,252
Damn it, now I'm thinking
about those peeps again.

140
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,924
Oh, I was worried
you two wouldn't make it.

141
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,160
You always have your mind
on business,

142
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,462
and Andy was such
an easy spirit.

143
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:44,364
I think you mean
"free spirit."

144
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:46,266
Easy spirit is a shoe
worn by people

145
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,468
whose spirits have died.

146
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,303
I have two pairs.

147
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:51,571
Okay, fine.
Give it back.

148
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,373
I'll find someone else
with a business.

149
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:56,376
What about Sophie?
She owns a small business,

150
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:57,577
and she loves to give,

151
00:05:57,578 --> 00:06:00,911
not as much as she
loves to receive.

152
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,417
I'm not so sure
Sophie's cleaning business

153
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:05,252
is totally, well, legal.

154
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,386
I mean,
when we worked for her,

155
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:07,754
on the memo line
of our paycheck,

156
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:10,023
she wrote "colonoscopy."

157
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,592
And for the record,
Sophie's cleaning business

158
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:14,194
is totally legit.

159
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:17,528
Her organ-trading
might not be.

160
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,633
Forget it, Caroline.

161
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,468
We might deport you
ourselves.

162
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,802
All we need is a FedEx box.

163
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,241
Um, Caroline.
Come over here.

164
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,876
I think I can help you
with that.

165
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:32,079
Thanks, Earl, but you
don't have a small business.

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,413
The size of my business
has never been in question.

167
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:41,555
And I may not
have a business,

168
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:44,057
but...

169
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:47,391
Han Lee does.

170
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,964
Max, look.
Earl forged Han's signature.

171
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:52,833
That's what his signature
looks like.

172
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,401
When I forge it,
I just draw a picture

173
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:57,735
of Hello Kitty.

174
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,582
You want to know
your future?

175
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,484
Oh.
No, no thanks.

176
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:11,518
You sure?

177
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,387
I have a message
about your love life.

178
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:16,456
$10.

179
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:27,031
Are you asleep?

180
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:29,870
Max?
Max, I really need to talk.

181
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,573
Oh, just come in
and get it over with.

182
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:36,309
Everybody else does.

183
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,945
Max, I'm sorry,
but I really need to talk.

184
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:40,780
I went to the fortune teller
near the diner,

185
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:43,150
and she told me that
I'd never find love in my life.

186
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:45,185
Fortune-telling's a scam.

187
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:47,754
"You'll never find a man,
your moon's in Uranus,

188
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,422
no man will ever be
in Uranus."

189
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:51,858
I could've told you that
the second day I met you.

190
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,927
Please, Max,
just listen for five minutes.

191
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,529
Come over here.
I'll make you some tea.

192
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,098
Tea?
Who am I, Pippa Middleton?

193
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,301
Toast me an eggo waffle
and maybe I'm listening.

194
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:02,602
Well, we were
saving that waffle

195
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,905
for a special occasion,
but okay.

196
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,239
Chestnut, we're eating
your birthday waffle now.

197
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:10,810
I don't know
why I'm pissing him off.

198
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,213
He's gonna be the only man
in my life.

199
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:16,547
I can't believe you blew $10
on a psychic.

200
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,818
Why didn't you just buy
a Skinnygirl Margarita

201
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,521
like all
the other lonely white chicks?

202
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:23,323
I spent $50.

203
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:26,326
I bought a crystal
that protects me from bad juju.

204
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,660
Hey! There's no reason
to get anti-semitic.

205
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,899
You spent money on crystal
you can't snort?

206
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,935
What is wrong with you?

207
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:37,804
I freaked out.
I didn't want it to be true.

208
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:40,340
Is it true, Max?
Am I never gonna find love?

209
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,775
Was Andy my one chance?

210
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,109
Did I screw it up
because I wanted success?

211
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,544
Was everyone right?

212
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:47,878
That is a lot of questions
for one waffle.

213
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:50,417
And where is that waffle?

214
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:51,918
You're a bad waitress
at home too.

215
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:54,621
Who could that be?

216
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,890
I don't know.
Let me consult the spirits.

217
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:59,526
Who is it?

218
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:02,229
It's Sophie.

219
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,698
Yeah, it's me,

220
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:08,032
the shady lady
with the illegal business.

221
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:11,171
Yeah, and Caroline,
you owe me an apology

222
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,505
or I will take out
these hoops,

223
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:15,839
and we will get into it,
girl.

224
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:17,978
Yeah, and I warn you,

225
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:21,312
I did some extreme fighting
in Warsaw.

226
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:23,516
Extreme fighting?
That's awesome.

227
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,385
Yeah, they would throw

228
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:26,886
a big hunk of cheese
in a trough

229
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:30,220
and let all the village girls
just go at it.

230
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:32,692
Sorry, Sophie.

231
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:34,394
It just seemed like
a better business decision

232
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,996
to go with the forgery.

233
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:37,964
What is that?

234
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,700
Is that a waffle?

235
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,034
Okay!
You are forgiven.

236
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,741
Damn it.
I didn't even get a bite.

237
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:49,643
I'm awake and sober
for nothing.

238
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:52,245
Sophie, do you believe
in psychics?

239
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,948
Oh, no.
That's all fake.

240
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:57,117
You know, I knew a family
of gypsy psychics

241
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,085
who couldn't even predict
that they would all die

242
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,321
in a barn fire.

243
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,024
Hey, girls.
Sorry to interrupt,

244
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:07,160
but Sophie promised
to rub antifungal cream

245
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,729
on my thick,
yellow toenails.

246
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,331
Oleg, come over here.

247
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:14,665
I'll do it in between bites.

248
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:17,637
This is what you're afraid
you're missing?

249
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:19,806
Because
this is a relationship.

250
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:22,442
Seriously, Max.
That's something I really want.

251
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:25,145
And now
I'm never gonna have it.

252
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,315
Get in there, baby.
I have two feet.

253
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:32,452
Interesting.

254
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,921
She's a psychic,
but she needs a bell

255
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:37,257
to tell her someone's here.

256
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:39,592
Max, please
don't make me do this.

257
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,761
I don't want to hear
any more bad things.

258
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,630
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

259
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:44,964
She's gonna tell you
you have

260
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:46,800
a bright, love-filled future

261
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:49,969
or I'm gonna kick her
in the crystal balls.

262
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,404
Hello, girls.

263
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:53,540
I'll tell you your future
as soon as I finish eating.

264
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,941
It'll only take a minute.

265
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:58,275
Since I quit smoking,
I eat like a prisoner.

266
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,612
Come, sit, ruminate
on your wishes and dreams.

267
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:05,315
Well, my wish is that you give
my friend her money back,

268
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,954
and my dream is
that I'm a backup dancer

269
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,723
for Missy Elliott.

270
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:13,460
Great. A wise-ass.

271
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,562
Do you want to know
your future or not?

272
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,364
Um, you already told me
my future.

273
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,365
That's why we're here.

274
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,066
You said
I'd never find love.

275
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,369
When did I say that?

276
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,538
And you, tough guy, don't say,
"Well, you're the psychic."

277
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,408
Maybe she is a psychic,
because I am a tough guy

278
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:31,077
and I was gonna say that.

279
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:32,479
You know,
it's hard to remember.

280
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,714
I see a lot
of sad, single girls.

281
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,049
But looking at you
right now,

282
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,318
it makes sense.

283
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,054
And here.
Take your phony crystal back.

284
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,089
And I'm not so sure
this is a real crystal.

285
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,423
It looks like one of
those vegan deodorant things.

286
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:48,661
And we want our money.

287
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:54,364
Oh, okay.
What just happened?

288
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:57,637
I put a curse on you.

289
00:11:57,638 --> 00:12:00,340
Max, you said nothing bad
was gonna happen!

290
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,674
Well, I'm not a psychic,
and neither is she.

291
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,246
Laugh, Buster.

292
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:08,281
Nothing in life
will go your way,

293
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,450
and you will live
under a dark cloud.

294
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:13,253
Will this dark cloud merge

295
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,121
with the current dark cloud
above me

296
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:17,724
or fly alongside of it?

297
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:19,959
Look, we don't want
to trouble you,

298
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,594
but if you could
remove the curse

299
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:24,764
and possibly that noodle
on your blouse...

300
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,437
Oh, no.
Did you just--

301
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:32,071
Cursed you too.

302
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:35,405
Tell you what.
I'll lift both curses for 50,

303
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:38,411
or else your whole life
will come crashing down

304
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,079
all around you.

305
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,413
The only way I'm giving
a strange woman 50 bucks

306
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,284
is if I'm walking out of here
with a genital piercing.

307
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:51,558
I do that as well.

308
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:57,163
Don't believe in curses,
never have.

309
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:59,165
Not since Jennifer Martin
told me I was going to hell

310
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,567
for sleeping
with her boyfriend.

311
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:01,768
But I didn't.

312
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:03,403
I just ended up going
to homecoming with him.

313
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,438
Max, we have to go back
and pay her.

314
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,840
Our lives are hard enough.

315
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:09,242
We don't need things to come
crashing down around us.

316
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:12,576
Relax. Nothing's coming
crashing down around us.

317
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,882
Don't jump, Paul!
Paul, don't jump!

318
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,083
Paul? Who's Paul?

319
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,384
Oh.

320
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:20,353
And what is he doing
on the roof?

321
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:24,424
Okay.

322
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:27,327
That was Paul's life
that came crashing down,

323
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,395
not ours.

324
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:37,423
Max, I think
we all know that

325
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:38,924
I'm a highly educated woman

326
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:40,459
who doesn't really believe
in curses,

327
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,361
but I am putting every penny
we make tonight

328
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:43,729
in the "lift the curse"
fund.

329
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,231
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

330
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,300
we're not spending
another 50 bucks

331
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:49,535
on some stupid curse.

332
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:52,869
A body fell from the sky!

333
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,491
Paul got a bad batch
of shrooms.

334
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,126
It had nothing to do
with the curse.

335
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,595
Everyone knows
you don't take psychedelics

336
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:03,298
above the second floor.

337
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,467
Poor amateur bastard.

338
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:08,637
And we need our money
for essentials, like food

339
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,971
and the penguin statue
I saw at the Dollar Store.

340
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:15,307
The one that says
"Chill out."

341
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,045
So chill out.

342
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:19,781
Caroline,
I feel bad

343
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,250
about not signing your letter
of recommendation.

344
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,286
So I wrote one myself
and signed it.

345
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:25,854
Here.

346
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,622
That's so nice of you.

347
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:30,625
"The extremely hardworking
Caroline Channing,

348
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,094
"who has devoted her life
to business

349
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,930
and nothing
and no one else."

350
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,766
Han, this is supposed
to be about getting a loan,

351
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,367
not being alone.

352
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:42,204
I totally get it, girl.
I'm alone as well.

353
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:45,307
We have our eyes on the prize,
so our beds are empty.

354
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:48,641
But occasionally,
I pay for it.

355
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,151
Did Han just intimate

356
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:59,485
that he occasionally
gets a hooker?

357
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:02,491
Lucky bastard.

358
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:05,825
He probably gets
a child's discount.

359
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:11,197
Max, look.
The future's already happening.

360
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,068
Even in Han's letter,
I'm alone.

361
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,903
The only chance for
a love life I have now

362
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,139
is going halfsies on a hooker
with Han.

363
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,608
We have to reverse
the curse now.

364
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,577
News flash:
Everybody is cursed.

365
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,713
You lost your money
last year.

366
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:28,047
Literally nothing good
has ever happened to me.

367
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:30,852
Han hasn't grown
since the fourth grade.

368
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,686
Oleg's toenails
look like Fritos.

369
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:39,225
And Earl was born black at
the eighth-or ninth-worst time

370
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:42,364
to be a black man
in America.

371
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:45,698
Look around,
it's the valley of the damned.

372
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,470
Name one person
who isn't cursed.

373
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,771
Hey, guys!

374
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,841
I just found a $100 bill
on the sidewalk!

375
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,177
Drinks for everyone!

376
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:57,813
Max,
pop open the fancy brandy.

377
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:00,148
"Fancy Brandy"
is gonna be my stripper name

378
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:02,784
if you ever let me
put in that pole.

379
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:03,919
Sophie, guess what?

380
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,720
We went back to that psychic
to complain,

381
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:07,489
and she put a curse on us.

382
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,823
Oh.
You're cursed?

383
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:16,295
Uh...

384
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:24,906
But it's stupid,
like you said, right?

385
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,240
Yeah, yeah.
That's stupid.

386
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:30,245
Yeah.

387
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:33,579
Did she mention me?

388
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,617
No.

389
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:37,686
She just cursed us
and said

390
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:40,722
our whole lives would
come crashing down around us.

391
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:52,031
And 30, 40, 50.

392
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:56,335
The curse is lifted.

393
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:59,341
Oh, I don't think you got me.
What about my curse?

394
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,411
Talk about phoning it in.

395
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,547
Couldn't you wave a feather
or spin your head

396
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,349
or throw up
or something?

397
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,552
That's extra.

398
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:12,587
You know what?
I'm in a good mood tonight.

399
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:15,223
I got through the whole day
on 15 cigarettes

400
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:16,491
and one sheet cake.

401
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:19,825
I'm gonna give tough guy
a free reading here.

402
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:23,462
Oh, free, as in the $50
you just shook us down for?

403
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,803
Should never have quit.
Okay.

404
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,174
Future coming right at you.

405
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,844
I see that you will
have a happy life.

406
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,712
Me, happy?

407
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:39,714
All right, get your hat,
mother. We're leaving.

408
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:43,048
And I see a large sum of money
coming your way.

409
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,253
Over $10,000.

410
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:47,222
Max, it's the grant.

411
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:49,391
We applied for $12,000.
Is that it?

412
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:52,193
Sure.

413
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:55,030
And in spite
of your bad childhood...

414
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,665
She knew
you had a bad childhood.

415
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,833
Come on,
every childhood is bad.

416
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,402
You're stupid.
You can't reach stuff.

417
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,737
It's rough.

418
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,105
In spite of it,

419
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:07,439
I see great love and children
in your future.

420
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,778
Max.

421
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,680
Me?
No, wait.

422
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,014
You must be picking up
on her vibes.

423
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,115
Check again.

424
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:17,749
No, great love
and children

425
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:20,120
will be part of your future.

426
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:24,826
She will die alone.

427
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:26,661
Okay, well,
that's all I can take.

428
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:28,797
I'm not gonna sit here and wait
for the other Paul to fall.

429
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:30,298
- Let's go, Max.
- No, no, no, no.

430
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,499
No, no. Wait.

431
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,833
She obviously got it wrong.
Didn't you?

432
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:39,107
Nope.
Still dying alone...

433
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,810
With nothing
but her great success.

434
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:43,645
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What?

435
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:46,314
I see great success
in your future.

436
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,817
You do?
Oh, thank God.

437
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:51,653
I'm gonna have success?
How big a success?

438
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:52,821
Oh, honey, it's so big,

439
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:56,057
you won't even know
you're alone.

440
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,062
All right, go.

441
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:04,299
May you live
a long and healthy life.

442
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,067
And put on your hat
and gloves.

443
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:09,401
I'm predicting snow.

444
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,176
It's not going to snow.

445
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:18,013
At most, it's gonna rain
30-year-old dudes.

446
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:20,048
Maybe she isn't so psychic.

447
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:21,683
Stop fighting it, Max.

448
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,084
You're gonna find love
and be happy,

449
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,120
and I'm gonna be successful.

450
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,221
You hear that, New York?

451
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:29,555
I'm gonna be
successful and alone!

452
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:33,561
And robbed and raped
if you keep calling that out.

453
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,163
And it all started
when I dropped

454
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:37,265
that grant application
into that mailbox

455
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,501
that those guys are unbolting
and taking away.

456
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:40,969
What's going on?

457
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,004
It's called emails.

458
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:45,507
We're getting rid of this.
No one mails anything anymore.

459
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:47,675
Yes, they do.
I did yesterday.

460
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:50,045
And our $12,000 depends on it.

461
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,312
Sorry, doll.

462
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:53,081
This box has been
out of commission for a week.

463
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,183
According to a psychic,
her box is gonna be

464
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:57,118
out of commission forever.

465
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,286
We had to tell him.

466
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,322
You expect me to lie
to a city employee?

467
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:04,359
So I guess
we're not getting that grant.

468
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,461
The psychic was wrong.

469
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:08,730
Maybe nothing she said
is gonna come true.

470
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:12,000
I told you,
it's a scam.

471
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,269
Max, look.

472
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,505
It's snowing.
And she predicted snow.

473
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:20,839
Oh, crap!
Am I gonna have kids?

474
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:24,012
So she was right on snow,
but not on the money.

475
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,014
So what is it?

476
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,917
Am I or am I not gonna die
old and alone?

477
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,885
Why are we even
talking about this?

478
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:33,488
We're probably not gonna
make it through the winter.

479
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:36,791
And by the way,
if you die first,

480
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,726
I am totally eating you.

481
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:40,695
Oh. I know.

482
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,263
And besides,

483
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:44,332
no one person
can get it all.

484
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,700
You're right.

485
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:48,703
No one person can,
but what about two?

486
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,371
You'll have
the love and the kids

487
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:51,539
and I'll have success.

488
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,741
Maybe we can share,
like we share our tips

489
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,377
or that wheat thin we found
in your pillowcase.

490
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:58,746
Are you asking to bang
my great love?

491
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,082
Which is fine with me,
because I'm already bored

492
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,485
and sleeping with
his poker buddy.

493
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:04,886
In fact, let's switch.

494
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,455
You can have my great love,
and I'll die alone.

495
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:10,125
Max, you don't want
to die alone.

496
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:13,459
I am dying to die alone.

497
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,459
