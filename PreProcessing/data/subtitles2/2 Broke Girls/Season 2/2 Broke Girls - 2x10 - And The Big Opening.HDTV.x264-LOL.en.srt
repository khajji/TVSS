Earl, time to play
"Marry, Sleep with, or Kill:

3
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:07,311
Ladies, booth one?

4
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:10,032
Sleep with, sleep with,
<i>slept</i> with.

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:11,983
Nice.

6
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:14,669
Okay, Max,
the dude at table ten.

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:17,905
Is there a "Throw food
in the cage and run" category?

8
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:19,340
Hey, jump in.

9
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:20,925
We're playing "Marry,
Sleep with, or Kill:"

Diner edition."

11
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:24,929
No, if I slept with
anyone in this diner,

12
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:27,715
I'd kill myself.

13
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,050
Even in a fictional scenario,

14
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:31,436
I cannot permit myself
to go there.

15
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:33,771
Girl, you'd take the fun
out of the punch bowl

16
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:35,690
full of cocaine.

17
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:37,692
Okay, fine.

18
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,228
Sleep with Earl,
marry you.

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,896
Not us!
Jeez.

20
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:43,597
What are you, a freak?

21
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:47,151
I feel uncomfortable,
Caroline.

22
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:50,455
Like, I don't know
how to look at you anymore.

23
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:53,941
Now, I can only see you
in a creepy lady tux.

24
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:55,793
You said it
was just a game!

25
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:58,748
I'm not in love with you.
Back off!

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,133
It was just a joke, Earl.

27
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:04,085
The things we say
in jest, darling.

28
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:06,921

in jest.

Oh, my God, look at the RSVP
list for our opening party.

34
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:27,911
Max's Homemade Cupcakes
is at capacity.

35
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,496
Hey, we might
even be overbooked,

36
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,997
because in my experience,
even when guys

37
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,266
say they're not going
to come, they do.

38
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,904
Caroline, booth two
has been waiting

39
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,473
for service
for ten minutes!

40
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,341
And Han knows
how frustrating that is,

41
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:44,395
'cause he's been waiting
to be serviced for years.

42
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,397
Not that it's any
of your business, Max,

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,018
but I have a very active
sex life.

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,322
So then, Han, will you be
bringing a date tomorrow night?

45
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,692
Ah, no.

46
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:03,163
You do understand that sex
involves two people, right?

47
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:07,417
And that one of those people
has to be you?

48
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,752
What is all this dirty talk?

49
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,922
This is a diner,
not a dirty talking place.

50
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,040
Sorry, Han, I know
we still work here at night.

51
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,625
I'll go right over
to the booth.

52
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,794
We were just talking
about our big opening party.

53
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:21,164
All you ever talk
about is your big opening.

54
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,301
Now who has
the potty mouth?

55
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:30,807
Max, I need
your guest list names.

56
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:32,859
Oh, okay, I'm still waiting
for them to confirm,

57
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,194
so just put me down
for ten.

58
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,229
Okay, but I need
their names asap.

59
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm running
a tight door.

60
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,565
I got a bouncer
from a local club

61
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,983
to donate his time.

62
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:43,436
I told him it
was a charity event for eczema.

63
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:46,206
What? We'll make a big donation
when we're successful,

64
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,624
but, for tomorrow,
every now and then,

65
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,243
scratch a little?

66
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:53,413
Hi, everybody!
I got great news.

67
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:57,884
What? You finally found
the thing we lost in there?

68
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,622
No. I knew we should've
tied a string on it.

69
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,842
No, look.
I got a fax from Poland.

70
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:08,461
My dream house is done!
Isn't it amazing?

71
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,896
It is amazing.

72
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,149
I haven't seen a fax
in, like, five years.

73
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,068
Sophie, it's so pretty!

74
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,569
Look at all this sweet
gingerbread woodwork

75
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,570
on the porch.

76
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,855
Oh, I'm so excited.

77
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:20,806
I'm going to be
on Air Poland flight

78
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,609
right after big party.

79
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:25,662
You are going to Poland?
That's news.

80
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,113
And when were you
going to tell me?

81
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,115
Um, now, yeah.

82
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:31,000
Um, I'm going to be gone
for a month.

83
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,535
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,087
It will be good
to have some time away

85
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,539
from the old ball and chain.

86
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,125
Yeah, he's not talking
about me.

87
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,879
We use a ball and chain
in our lovemaking.

88
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,133
That's the thing
I can't find.

89
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,335
All right.

90
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:51,020
Okay, yeah.

91
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,805
Well, buh-bye.

92
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:56,476
I'll see you tomorrow night
at my big going away party!

93
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,028
Sophie, the party's
for our cupcake business.

94
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,316
Oh, see, this is why
I don't like you so much.

95
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,372
Guys, thanks again
for donating your time.

96
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,157
It's fundraisers like this
that will help

97
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,494
put an end
to undescended testicles.

98
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:16,629
Hi!

99
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,364
I'd like to meet the owner
of this awesome

100
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,999
and totally cool
cupcake shop?

101
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,302
Oh, nevermind!
That's me.

102
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,454
Max, you got a blow-out!

103
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,989
Yeah, I'd figured
I finally see

104
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,510
what all the fuss
about getting blown is.

105
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:33,229
Oh, hi, we're not
quite ready for guests yet.

106
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,566
Girl,
I'm your doorman, Nevel.

107
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,351
Oh, I'm confused.
I thought my doorman was--

108
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:40,853
Straight, white, and boring?
He was.

109
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,655
Then, boring came down
with the flu.

110
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,526
Now, you've got gay, black,
and definitely not boring.

111
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:47,860
So what's
the charity tonight?

112
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,280
- Eczema.
- Undescended testicles.

113
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:53,783
People with eczema
<i>and</i> undescended testicles.

114
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:56,621
Lord, child.
That is a cross to bear.

115
00:04:58,623 --> 00:04:59,923
Get me the door list,
and let's make

116
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,042
those poor, itchy boys
some money.

117
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,179
Another fake charity?

118
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,582
You've got some balls,
even if they aren't descended.

119
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,250
Max, we so lucked out.

120
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,885
Nothing says
"successful party"

121
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,605
like a bitchy, gay doorman!

122
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,557
Give me your guest names.
I'll write them down.

123
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,359
Okay, fine.

124
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,262
Put down Tommy, Dylan,
Robbie, Johnny--

125
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,365
Robbie and Johnny?

126
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,234
Wait, Max, are these
all your ex-boyfriends?

127
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,603
Perhaps.

128
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,388
Max, the invited guests

129
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,574
were all supposed
to be business contacts.

130
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:36,576
See, this is why I didn't
tell you sooner.

131
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:38,077
You're a control freak.

132
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,113
And for the record,
these guys have all had contact

133
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:43,449
with my business.

134
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,385
You're using
our launch party

135
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,119
to get back
at ex-boyfriends?

136
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,954
Uh, yeah!

137
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,506
That's what success
is for,

138
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:53,125
to say "suck it"
to people who dumped you.

139
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,178
"See my blown-out hair?
Suck it!

140
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,230
"See my cool cupcake shop?
Suck it!

141
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,601
See these in this blouse?
You <i>wish</i> you could suck it."

142
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:06,272
And here, it is not just
boyfriends on my list.

143
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:08,474
I also invited
the lady from Staples

144
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:09,909
who gives me attitude.

145
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,729
She can suck it too.

146
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:14,647
Fine, but how
is inviting Johnny

147
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,449
and his new wife
a victory?

148
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:17,750
Oh, like this.

149
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,786
"Hi, Mrs. Johnny.
Nice to meet you."

150
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:21,287
You got him,
but I got these

151
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,824
"And all this,
so suck it."

152
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:26,426
I'm not so sure
this is healthy.

153
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,044
Are you kidding me?

154
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:31,547
This is the healthiest thing
I've done in my life.

155
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,099
I even thought
about inviting my mother

156
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,767
to come and suck it,
but then she'd realize

157
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,686
maybe I didn't commit suicide
two years ago

158
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,389
like my note said.

159
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:41,024
I'm about ready
to open.

160
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,226
Shouldn't we be putting up
some testicle banners,

161
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,279
or scrotum posters,
or something?

162
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,815
Also, there's a cute blonde boy
out here asking for you

163
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,149
that I'm about
to eat alive.

164

[Groans]

165
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,453
That's Andy
with the free bar stuff.

166
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,737
Go, I'm gonna stay here

167
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,689
and practice my "suck it" face
for a while.

168
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,991
How's this?

169
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,244
That look
is so much more "suck it"

170
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,245
with the straight hair.

171
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,915
[Laughs]
I know, right?

172
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,817
- There's my cute boyfriend.
- Hey.

173
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,335
How did everything go
at Spike's Liquor?

174
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:10,920
Well, I got
a little bit confused

175
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,505
about what charity
we're pretending to help,

176
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,340
so I told them
my sister's homeless

177
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:17,042
and my balls
are up inside me.

178
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:19,145
Now, we just gotta hope
Spike's not the chatty type.

179
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,213
[Laughs]

180
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:22,398
Oh! They just dropped.

[Laughs]

182
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,069
Hey, Andy, question.

183
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,821
What does this face
say to you?

184
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,023
I don't know,
like, "I'm cool."

185
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,109
So close!
Guess again.

186
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,911
Okay, like,
"I'm better than you."

187
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,613
No, like, "I'm it,
and you can suck it."

188
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,252
Yes! Yes!
They can suck it!

189
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:43,669
Is that
what you're wearing tonight?

190
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,755
Yeah.
No?

191
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,956
A sweater?

192
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,674
I always saw you
in a suit tonight.

193
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,193
Run home real quick
and put on a suit.

194
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,879
Hurry, people
are starting to come.

195
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,264
Uh, Max is still
making the face.

196
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,849
I know.
I can't stop.

197
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,603
I've waited my whole life
to make this face.

198
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,889
[Giggles]

199
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,440
Max, look.

200
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,058
Our business is open.

201
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,694
Wait, wait, wait.
Not quite.

202
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,865
In five, four,
three, two.

203
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,067
Both: Whoo!

204
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,938
- Name, please?
- Sophie Kuchenski.

205
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,241
Guest of honor.
[Cheering]

206
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:25,611
- How many in your party?
- See, I <i>knew</i> it was my party!

207
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,330
[Cheering and clapping]

[Lounge music]

209
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,556
Max, there's a line
all the way down the hall

210
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:39,457
and I've given out,
like, a hundred business cards!

211
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,695
You know what that means?
Being poor can suck it!

212
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:46,030
Girl, the Fire Marshal
just dropped by,

213
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,049
and told me
we can't let anymore people in

214
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,767
till some of these folks
go out.

215
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,620
Nevel, none of my guests
are even here yet.

216
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:54,488
It is very important
to let in any guy

217
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,574
who looks hot, but you know
would screw you over.

218
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,460
Is there any other type?

219
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:01,630
I'll go get
some more cupcakes.

220
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,131
Hey!
How's it going so far, babe?

221
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,333
Andy, what are you doing?

222
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,867
I told you to come back
in a suit.

223
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,553
Yeah, I know,
but I like what I'm wearing.

224
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,838
So you're telling me
you'll just go

225
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,473
and do what you want,
no matter how much

226
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:13,707
I try to control you?

227
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:15,893
Yeah.

228
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,679
That is so freaking hot.

229
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,232
Caroline!

230
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,385
Caroline, I can't get in!

231
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:27,774
Caroline! Less kissing,
more noticing me!

232
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:32,443
See, I know her,
and my name's on the list.

Han Lee.

234
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:35,496
Honey,
if I was a fat girl,

235
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:36,781
and your name was Sara Lee,

236
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:39,200
you still
wouldn't be getting in.

237
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,919
We are at capacity!

Hey, Robbie.
On the list.

00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,376
Go right on in, child.

240
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:51,014
Uh, hello?

241
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:56,133
Do you need a dictionary
to define the word "capacity?"

242
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,969
I have clear orders:

243
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:00,087
Only very hot men
who look like trouble.

Mm-hmm.

Excuse me, you know
where I can find Max?

- Yes, she's in the back.
- Cool.

Oh, sorry.

Did we have sex?

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,489
What? No!

251
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:19,907
I'm Max's roommate.

252
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,576
Oh, Max had a roommate?

253
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,245
I was pretty much wasted
the whole time.

254
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,497
I remember,
like, nothing,

255
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:30,001
but I'm in the program now,
so it's one day at a time.

00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:32,803
- Well, Max is through there.
- [Chuckles] Cool.

00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:34,755
But we did have sex, right?

No!
We did not have sex.

259

You offered,
but I wasn't into you.

261
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,164
Yeah, right.

262
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,603
- Hey, Max.
- Robbie!

263
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,988
Why are you
making that face?

264
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,190
You have a toothache
or something?

265
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:56,444
No, it's--
I'm successful now

266
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,862
and this is my shop.

267
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,980
Wow. Cool.

268
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:02,583
So listen,
I'm an alcoholic now,

269
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,818
and I did a lot of stuff
that wasn't cool,

270
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,620
and I came here
because the program

271
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,823
says that I have
to make almonds.

272
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,511
"Almonds"?

273
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,430
You mean "amends"?

274
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:20,101
Cool. So, look,
I cheated on you

275
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,887
behind your back,
like, every day.

276
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,940
Well, um, we don't have
to go into all this now.

277
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,391
It's kind of a big night
for me.

278
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:29,894
And I stole money
from you too,

279
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,030
like, every time
we had sex.

280
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:35,066
But we had a <i>lot</i>
of sex.

281
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,233
[Chuckles]
I know.

282
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,353
Well, I stole a lot
of money.

283
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:42,623
Well, this just went
from "suck it" to "it sucks,"

284
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,458
so lift up your shirt.

285
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,112
I gotta get something
out of tonight.

286

[Inhales sharply]

287
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:50,298
Money well spent.

Just found out
I paid for more sex

289
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:58,039
than an Arab businessman.

290
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,541
Maybe this wasn't
the healthiest thing

291
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,708
I could've done tonight.

292
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,060
So what do you
wanna do?

293
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:05,263
Should I tell Nevel
to keep Johnny out?

294
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:08,649
Too late.
Way too late.

295
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:09,934
Max.

[Weakly]
Hi.

297
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:14,388
You look even better
than I remember.

298
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,024
Well, I should.
I just got blown.

Suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it.

301
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,080
Max, this place
is so awesome.

302
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:24,548
It's like
you're telling everybody

303
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,534
who ever doubted you
to suck it.

304
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:30,121
No, we're not petty
like that.

305
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,738
Hey, it's a little loud
in here.

306
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,057
You wanna talk
in the hall?

307
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,627
Uh, wait, let me take a look
around my big, successful shop.

308
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,945
Yeah, I can go.

309
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:39,930
Keep your eye on Max.

310
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,265
That guy
in the Brad Pitt glasses

311
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,918
broke her heart,
and I don't trust him.

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,053
Max, you look insanely good.

313

Thanks.

314
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,523
Now, maybe you could repeat that
to your wife,

315
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,642
and where is she?

316
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:52,926
We never got married.

I can't get in!

Wait, what do you mean
you didn't get married?

319

Johnny!
Hey, Johnny, I'm back here!

320
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,405
I didn't know
if I was gonna tell you,

321
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,606
but then I got your invite--

322
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:08,910
Max! Johnny!
I'm back here!

323
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,278
Should we just
go say "hi"?

324
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,997
Uh, no,
not right now.

325
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,467
Max! Max!
I can't get in!

Max! Johnny!

327
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,839
Max, I've been thinking
about you a lot.

328
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,308
Stop. Before you
say anything else,

329
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,894
I just have to say

330
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,264
I need candy.

331
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,983
[Mumbling] All right,
what were you saying?

332
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:35,821
I called off the wedding
because she wasn't the one,

333
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:39,023
and you wanna know
how I know that?

I can't get
into the party!

337
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:46,847
Come here.

00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,282
Help me out!

is a biatch!

Making out
in a room full of candy.

00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:06,967
Right.

346
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:08,219
No, no, this can't happen.

347
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,854
I was gonna give you
my "suck it" face.

Okay, give it to me.
I deserve it.

Your "suck it" face
is hot.

making pancakes?

You do,
and I am.

are the balls.

Great! So what's
gonna happen now?

371
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:31,540
I meant today,
at the shop,

372
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,925
our big first day
in business!

373

You thought I was talking
about you two?

Plbbt! I don't care
about you two.

Plbbt! Nobody cares
about you two.

Well, first, we have
to clean the party mess up.

377
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:42,718
Andy and I
did it last night

378
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,687
when you didn't come back.

379
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,889
Um, can someone here
mellow out

380
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:50,025
and put some pancakes
in her pancake hole?

381
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,443
No, Caroline,
I get it.

382
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:53,696
It's been a rocky ride
for Max and me.

383
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,397
See, when we met,
I had a girlfriend.

384
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,815
Which he never told her
about, and--

385
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,684
And keep eating.

386
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:00,185
And because of that,
Max and I

387
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:01,537
never really
got together,

388
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:02,988
and then that girl and I
broke up,

389
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,023
and by the time
I saw Max again, I was--

390
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:07,042
Engaged to be married?

391
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:09,128
Yeah, yeah,
I was gonna get married.

same girlfriend?

Yeah, but that
didn't work out either,

395
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,052
and I've had a couple
girlfriends since--

[mumbling]
Oh! Only a couple!

397
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:22,675
Yeah, none of them
seemed to work out.

398
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,876
None of them are Max.

00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:28,564
Hey, save me a pancake.

400
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,385
It looks like Caroline
has plans to eat them all.

401
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,437
Well, Max, as far
as the "suck it" plan goes,

402
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,725
it looks like somebody
sucked something.

403
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:45,614
Pancakes, pancake hole.

404
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:46,615
He's a good guy.

405
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,117
Yeah, he seems cool.

406
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:50,753
Kinda falls in love a lot,
but hey...

407
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,338
And I did not tell him
to say that.

408
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,707
He never does what I say.
It's hot.

"But hey" what?

00:16:57,378 --> 00:16:58,761
Oh, we're continuing?

00:16:58,763 --> 00:16:59,879
Um, I don't know.

412
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,881
Maybe I'm partial,
but Max,

413
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,132
you're an "A."

414
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,300
He kind of seems
like a "B."

Minus.

416
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:07,720
First of all,
look at me.

417
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:11,507
I am clearly a "D,"

418
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,310
and I don't think
he falls in love a lot.

419
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:17,513
Man, I love, love,
love pancakes.

420
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:21,117
If I could,
I would marry a pancake.

421
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,794

Well, it's the first day open.

All those people are probably
tired from the party.

Yeah.

00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,370
Oh, and look!
We forgot to light it up.

we're open.

00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:53,551
- Go to work.

- First day!
- Yep.

433
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:04,911
No one's here.

434
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,780
Remember: All we have to sell
is 70 cupcakes a day

435
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,098
to keep on track.

436
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,367
70 cupcakes?
That's not so hard.

437
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:15,339
Maybe we should
do the light again.

three, two.

What time is it now?

441
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,140
Tomorrow, we only need
to sell 140 cupcakes.

442
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:38,277
140 cupcakes!
That's not so hard.

443
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,196
How many
did we sell today?

444
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:42,231
Four.

445
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,450
And all were
to Johnny.

446
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,368
I think I've made
a terrible mistake.

447
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,903
It's only
been three days.

448
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:49,038
Business will pick up.

449
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,573
No, with Johnny.

450
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,992
It's different now
that he's available.

451
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,327
Maybe I'm the kind of person
who only wants something

452
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:56,712
they can't have,
and then when they get it,

453
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:58,497
they don't want it anymore.

454
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:01,917
Okay, but do you feel that way
about the cupcake shop too?

455
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,169
No, I love
our cupcake shop.

456
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:05,554
Wow, that's the first time
I've ever said

out loud,

except for Robitussin.

It's Johnny.

00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,730
Well, I know
what I have to do.

461
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:16,965
Max, you can't change
your mind about him now.

462
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,318
He's our only customer!

463
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,238
By the way,
I've always loved him.

464
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,023
Hey, guys.

465
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,941
Um, could we talk
in the kitchen?

466
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:27,159
Yeah.

467
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,161
Wait, before you go,
I just wanna say

468
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,646
that no matter
what goes down in life,

469
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,915
we are always open
to your business.

470
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:39,255
We're either
gonna have crazy kitchen sex

471
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,873
or I'm getting expelled.

472
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,374
We're not having
kitchen sex.

473
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:43,993
It's way too dirty
in here

474
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:46,913
from other people
having kitchen sex.

475
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:50,049
So I'm getting expelled?

476
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,968
It's weird, right?
Between us?

477
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,503
Yeah, I don't know
what it is.

478
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:58,557
Maybe it's an absence
of a lot of candy...

479
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,608
[Chuckles]

480
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,310
But it's not the same.

481
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,562
Max! Johnny!
I thought I heard you.

482
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:07,015
Max!
[Banging on door]

483
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:08,317
I can't get out!

484
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,818
Maybe we're only
at our best

485
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,121
when you have
another girlfriend.

486
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,822
Maybe give me a call
when you get that going

487
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:15,074
in, like, ten minutes.

488
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,575
[Laughs]

489
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:18,744
Or I could just call you
on my actual wedding day.

490
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,330
Oh, cool!
Yeah, just call me 30 minutes

491
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:23,365
before the service,
and I'll be there.

492
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,001
Or better yet, call me at, like,
your 50th wedding anniversary.

493
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:28,537
Yeah,
now that's hot.

494
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:29,972
Max!
[Banging on door]

495
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,710
Johnny!
I'm cold!

496
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,563
Kiss good-bye?

497
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:40,484
Seriously, guys,
I can't feel my toes!

498
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:46,022
See, it's hot again
'cause we broke up!

499
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,074
I'll see you at my 50th,

500
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,577
if not before.

501
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,779
[Banging on door]

502
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,916
First the party,
now this.

503
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,787
When I have a party,
you won't be on the list.

504
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,288
You're right.
I deserve that.

505
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,124
No, I was doing
a power move.

506
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:06,927
Please, I'm begging you
to come.

507
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:10,095
We'll see.

508
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,347
I might be a little too busy

509
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,882
with my big, successful
cupcake shop,

510
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:15,104
so suck it.

511
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:19,255
