1
00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:02,451
Hi, I'm gonna be
your waitress

2
00:00:02,483 --> 00:00:04,451
'cause my mother drank.

3
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:07,201
We need a sec.

4
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:10,204
Feelin' kinda generous,
take two.

5
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:13,307
Then he said to me,
"Dude, your vagina is weird."

6
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:14,541
Dude, that's insane.

7
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:15,576
It is so not weird.

8
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,311
Your vagina's awesome.

9
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:18,679
Okay, I'm ready.

10
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,181
Now I need a sec.

11
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,449
Well, it's over.

12
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,817
I can't say it any more.

13
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:25,519
The vagina's
gone mainstream.

14
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:29,356
What's next?
A clothing line at target?

15
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:30,791
Aw, Max, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:32,326
It's your favorite word.

17
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:34,061
And my favorite body part.

18
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,429
But now everyone's saying it.

19
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,697
Well, we can
pick another word for it.

20
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,099
Something cute,
like cookie.

21
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:40,734
Yeah, it sounds like
a good idea

22
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,503
until you walk past
a bunch of girl scouts

23
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:45,472
selling their cookies
on the street.

24
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:46,707
Well, we've gotta
pick something,

25
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,575
'cause vagina's everywhere.

26
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,644
Where?

27
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,214
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

28
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:59,686
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh *

29
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:05,940

30
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:08,627
Previously on <i>2 Broke Girls...</i>

31
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:14,098
This is invitation to
Metropolitan Museum Annual Gala.

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,033
We have the invitation.
She'll be there.

33
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,970
You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

34
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:22,406
So you want me to taste your
cupcake in the ladies' room?

35
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:24,475
What's inappropriate
about that?

36
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:26,077
That is our beer batter

37
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,146
maple bacon
spring break cupcake.

38
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:29,480
Quite tasty.

39
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,048
Do you girls have a card?

40
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,884
Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

41
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,955
Max, have you
seen my phone?

42
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:39,490
I wanna take a picture
of this bad tip

43
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:40,825
and put it on Instagram.

44
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:42,794
Getting loose change
used to be so depressing,

45
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:44,996
but now I can
share it with strangers.

46
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:46,497
Let me sum it up.

47
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:47,832
Twitter is stupid.

48
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,902
And Instagram is Twitter
for people who can't read.

49
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,171
Where is my phone?

50
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:54,505
I could've sworn
I left it right here,

51
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,873
next to yours.

52
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,141
Oh, I'll just call it.

53
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:58,643
Oh, that's not necessary.

54
00:01:58,645 --> 00:01:59,977
I'm sure it'll turn up...

55
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,112
* My milkshake

56
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:02,580
* brings all the boys
to the yard *

57
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,748
* and they're like

58
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,816
* it's better than yours

59
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,184
in my pocket.

60
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,219
Max, why are you
hiding my phone in your apron?

61
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,288
Is that the big question,
really?

62
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,889
'Cause I think
the bigger question is,

63
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,357
why is your ringtone
"My milkshake

64
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:16,160
brings all the boys
to the yard"?

65
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:17,762
If you have to ask that,

66
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:20,631
you clearly have not
seen my milkshake.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,068
Okay, here.
I'm busted.

68
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,604
I was checking to see
if Martha Stewart called us yet.

69
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:27,839
You checked it again?

70
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,373
You check it, like,
every 15 minutes.

71
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,474
I know!

72
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,677
I am acting like
a little bitch.

73
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:35,246
Max, Martha Stewart
has our business card.

74
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:37,215
She liked our cupcakes.
She'll call.

75
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:40,017
Look, in my defense,
she asked for our card.

76
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:41,252
She got us
all hot and bothered.

77
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,020
And then what?
Nothing.

78
00:02:43,022 --> 00:02:45,756
Martha Stewart
is cake tease.

79
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:49,093
How dare you!

80
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:51,229
Martha Stewart
is not a cake tease.

81
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,763
Nothing worse
than a cake tease.

82
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,799
Ask any man.

83
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,735
Yeah, you shower,
you powder your sack.

84
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,971
For what?

85
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:03,007
Look, Max, relax.

86
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,109
She'll call.
Everything's gonna work out.

87
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,477
I mean, a year ago,
we didn't even have

88
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,645
a cupcake business.

89
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,113
Look how far we've come.

90
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,514
I haven't come at all,

91
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:13,584
thanks to the cake tease.

92
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:18,890
Oh, your cupcake is quite tasty.

93
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:20,224
Do you have a card?

94
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:22,393
Max, that's a good
Martha Stewart.

95
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:23,794
I know,
'cause I can't

96
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:26,530
get her siren voice
out of my head.

97
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:32,637
Wow, Han.

98
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,405
You look you were hit
by a Mardi Gras

99
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,641
and a Gay Pride float.

100
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:39,043
I have just returned
from the exciting

101
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,778
Manhattan Restaurant
Trade Show.

102
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,513
Look at all this
free swag.

103
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:44,415
And I've got stress balls.

104
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:47,485
Well, just go in the back
and take care of yourself.

105
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,187
Listen up, everybody.

106
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,455
I have a big announcement.

107
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:54,825
"- Well, more like
a 5'1" announcement.

108
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,961
I am changing the diner
to state-of-the-art

109
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:59,030
computer "power touch"
ordering system

110
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,364
for food and checks.

111
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,966
I am not
learning anything new.

112
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:05,002
I work here because
I have no skills.

113
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,405
You don't have
to learn it, Max.

114
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,873
It's very smart machine.

115
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,808
- It will help you.
- Uh-huh.

116
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,877
That's how it started
with machines in <i>The Matrix.</i>

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,479
Next thing you know,
the human race was enslaved.

118
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:16,847
Been there, done that.

119
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:19,617
I'm with Max.

120
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:20,785
We are doing it.

121
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:22,453
It's important
to move the business

122
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:23,754
into the future.

123
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:27,058
So get with it,
you luddites.

124
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,061
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
girls, we got big trouble.

125
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:32,129
If he starts
using a new system,

126
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,098
I won't be able
to use my old system

127
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,748
where I skim something
off the top.

128
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,483
Earl, skimming?

129
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:39,885
I'm kind of shocked.

130
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,320
I don't do it for me.

131
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,854
You know how once a month
you girls

132
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,914
have really good night in tips?

133
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,850
You're welcome.

134
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,985
I have been lying awake
at night

135
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,920
trying to figure out
how we made that 200 bucks

136
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:53,990
with her skills.

137
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,992
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, Sophie.

138
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,494
You know,
every time I come here,

139
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:00,430
Im 'surprised
you're still open.

140
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,401
Here you go, Sophie.

141
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,069
Hey.

142
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,470
Where's the little
Asian woman

143
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:09,773
that always hands me
my menu?

144
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,214
Asian woman?
You mean Han?

145
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,343
Mm-hm.

146
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,111
Sophie, Han's a man.

147
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:18,047
If you say so.

148
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,618
Is there anything special
tonight?

149
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,186
Yes.

150
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,622
Here I am...

151
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,591
With treats for my sweet.

152
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,093
Aww.

153
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,928
Day-glo zebra?

154
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,431
That's my favorite animal.

155
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:39,035
Oh, and edible underwear!

156
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:42,705
That's my favorite snack.

157
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:46,376
Yeah, and they're crotchless,
so less carbs.

158
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,183
Oh, and my favorite
microwavable lube.

159
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:57,554
And what's this?

160
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:00,056
Toothbrushes?

161
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:03,693
Oh, that's going to hurt you,
but okay.

162
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,130
No, I want to leave them
at your house,

163
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,965
now that you and I
are exclusive.

164
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,670
Exclusive?

165
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,005
Wait, hold phone.

166
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,841
Are you telling me
that you and I

167
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,342
are not exclusive?

168
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,110
Exclusive?

169
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,679
Oh, come on.

170
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:25,114
Stop it now.
Go on Jay Leno.

171
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:30,487
Caroline, did you think
Sophie and I were exclusive?

172
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:33,456
Well, you have stopped
showing us your penis.

173
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,325
Exactly!

174
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,794
If that's not exclusive,
I don't know what is.

175
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,762
Exclusive!

176
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,564
Oh, my God.

177
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,168
Oh, come on, stop it,
before I...

178
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,971
Oh. Oh.

179
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,405
It happened.

180
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,841
I split my spanx.

181
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,107
Martha Stewart, please.

182
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,527
It's Michelle Obama.

183
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,995
What's this about?

184
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:12,100
My sheets shrunk
and I am pissed.

185
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,935
Hello?

186
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:16,304
Max, it didn't work
when you were Mick Jagger

187
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:18,172
with a busted muffin tin,

188
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:21,709
or Alicia keys
with a wonky shower curtain.

189
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,611
And it really didn't work
when you were

190
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,146
Steve Jobs
back from the dead

191
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:28,082
with thoughts
on her panini press.

192
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,851
Stop sober dialing
Martha Stewart!

193
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:31,986
Who says I'm sober?

194
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:33,888
Max, give me your phone.

195
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,426
* My milkshake

196
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,161
* brings all the boys
to the yard *

197
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:41,762
Now give me my phone.

198
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,432
Okay, take it, done.
I'm over her.

199
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:46,367
When is she gonna call me?

200
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:49,270
My milkshake would totally
bring her to the yard.

201
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,606
Max, this isn't you.

202
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,740
I mean, you're strong.

203
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,108
You're a badass.

204
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,777
You beat H.P.V.
With Tylenol.

205
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,146
And it wasn't even
the name brand.

206
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,681
What's wrong with you?

207
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:02,750
I was a virgin
before Martha, okay?

208
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:05,253
No one ever told me I was good
at anything before her.

209
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,755
And you never forget
your first rich white woman.

210
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,590
With or without
Martha Stewart,

211
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,158
we're gonna build
our cupcake business

212
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,693
and be a success,
I just know it.

213
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,462
How?
How do you know that?

214
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:16,531
I know because
you have the talent,

215
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,666
I have the vision,
and because I feel it.

216
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,034
I feel it here.

217
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,537
Oh, blegh!
Your heart?

218
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,706
No. My pearls...
my lucky pearls.

219
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,543
By lucky,
do you mean ugly?

220
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:29,810
I've worn these
every day

221
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:31,479
since I was evicted
from my townhouse.

222
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:33,614
This pearl necklace
brings me luck.

223
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,116
You...

224
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:37,251
you think
your life is lucky?

225
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:41,222
This morning you used toilet
paper as a coffee filter...

226
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:44,926
And then used it
as toilet paper.

227
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:47,094
I know this
sounds silly to you,

228
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:48,329
but there
is something about

229
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,730
putting on these pearls
every day

230
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,033
that makes me feel strong,
confident,

231
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:53,868
and like anything
is possible.

232
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,338
And as long as I have
these lucky...

233
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02,510
Oh, no.
Oh, no!

234
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,644
No, no, no,
don't freak out.

235
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:04,712
Don't freak out.
We'll get them.

236
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:09,417
My pearls!

237
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,885
My lucky pearls!

238
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,987
Yes, yes, we have
identified the problem.

239
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,056
Just pick them up.

240
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:25,232
Whoa! Looks like
somebody found breakfast.

241
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:27,568
No, Chestnut!

242
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:30,671
I'm still using that.

243
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,773
Well, nothing's
gonna work out now.

244
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,075
Here comes the bad luck.

245
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:35,242
Don't be ridiculous.

246
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:38,079
Your luck
couldn't get any worse.

247
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,049
Aah!

248
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,955
Or could it?

249
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,295
Okay, Earl.

250
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:57,431
This is the L-520
Order System touch pad.

251
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,767
Look how simple.
See?

252
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,068
I'm telling you,

253
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,537
I can't figure this
tricky little thing out.

254
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,906
Earl,
it's an on/off button.

255
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,308
Oh, slow down.

256
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,277
It does both?

257
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,347
Let me just charge this up
for you right here.

258
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:16,751
Oh.

259
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:17,852
This thing
has been plugged

260
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:20,688
more than
the Kardashian sisters.

261
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:24,859
I better check the old wiring
in diner first.

262
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:27,294
Max, now I feel like
everyone's staring

263
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:28,696
at my chest area.

264
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:29,897
Well, welcome to my life,

265
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,033
every day
since I was nine.

266
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:34,468
That necklace
meant something special to me.

267
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,404
Didn't you ever
lose anything sentimental

268
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,905
you had for a long time?

269
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,875
My mother, but then
she found her way back.

270
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:43,577
Look, I am done waiting
for Martha to call.

271
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,813
I say we go down there
with some cupcakes,

272
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:47,181
remind her how much
she liked them,

273
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,050
and suggest she puts us
on her show.

274
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:51,452
No, I mean, I can't go
without my pearls.

275
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,421
And it's more
than just the luck.

276
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:55,890
It's who I was
before I lost everything.

277
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:57,124
You know how
I always say,

278
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,759
"hi, I'm Caroline Channing,"

279
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,194
and then touch my pearls?

280
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:01,762
I'm not just
introducing myself.

281
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:03,164
I'm reminding myself.

282
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,700
Well, let me remind you
of something else.

283
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:07,034
Yesterday you told me

284
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,270
we were going
to rule the world with cupcakes.

285
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:11,405
Yeah, that was
the pearls talking.

286
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,407
Okay, well,
now I'm talking.

287
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,675
There is no luck.

288
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:15,976
There is only work.

289
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:18,012
And right now,
you're working my last nerve.

290
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,081
So I am going
down there myself.

291
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,682
And if Martha
won't help me,

292
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,517
I'ma bust her kneecaps
with a rolling pin

293
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,587
and then say,
"Now <i>that's</i> a good thing."

294
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,044
Okay, what if we just
send Martha an email,

295
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,378
so we're not just
standing in her office,

296
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,579
begging some receptionist?

297
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,481
- That won't do anything.
- Yes, it will.

298
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,150
I craft amazing
business emails.

299
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,584
I went to Wharton.

300
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:46,187
Please don't, Max.
That's all I have left.

301
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,589
Max, Caroline,
I found something

302
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:49,857
at the restaurant
trade show

303
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,259
you might be
interested in.

304
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:53,027
The only restaurant trade
I'm interested in

305
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,364
is if we can exchange you
for anybody else.

306
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,699
You won't be laughing
in a minute.

307
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,201
Look, it's a cupcake
from the new

308
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,570
state-of-the-art
cupcake ATM machine.

309
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:04,806
Sprinkles cupcakes
plans to be put them everywhere.

310
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,675
Soon, everyone will be able
to just push a button,

311
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,078
day or night,
and get the cupcake.

312
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,447
So, I guess
what I'm saying is,

313
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,382
you might be screwed.

314
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,519
Delicious...

315
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,888
And no attitude.

316
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:24,859
Well, more bad luck.

317
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:25,993
I thought
you were kidding,

318
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,562
but the machines
are taking over.

319
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,796
We can't compete with that.

320
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,631
The business is done.
Game over.

321
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,317
Man, you are never
gonna make it in the future.

322
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,119
This is where
the humans fight.

323
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,121
This is where we march down
to Martha Stewart

324
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,456
and demand a damn blurb,

325
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,191
so we can compete
with the machines...

326
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:44,128
Just like in "Terminator 2:
Rise of the desserts."

327
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,930
Fine.
Let's go see Martha.

328
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,031
She's our only hope.

329
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,199
My lucky necklace is gone.

330
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,268
We can no longer
just wait for magic to happen.

331
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,602
Uh, thank you,
by the way,

332
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,171
for never telling me
that our former plan was magic.

333
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,944
We'll just reintroduce
ourselves and our cupcakes

334
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,846
to Martha and impress her
all over again,

335
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,514
even though I'm wearing
a necklace that I hate.

336
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,516
It's limp, anemic,
and lackluster.

337
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,152
I have an Olsen twin
around my neck.

338
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,687
Here.

339
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,155
What are you doing?

340
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,659
So Martha
will recognize me.

341
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,260
Hi, excuse me.
Two questions.

342
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,528
Which floor
is Martha Stewart on?

343
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,531
And should I lose
this necklace?

344
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,100
Well, your silence
speaks volumes.

345
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,669
Hi, I'm not crazy,

346
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,304
so you can just
tell me the floor number.

347
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,339
Elevator right over there,
15th floor,

348
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,007
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.

349
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,810
Just got a little damp.

350
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,180
Thanks for your help.
Feels better.

351
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,615
Smart,
getting necklace advice

352
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,949
from a guy with no neck.

353
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,018
Wait. Is that...

354
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,821
That's the cupcake machine
that Han was talking about.

355
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,523
Ugh, no!

356
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,991
I was hoping
it'd be ugly,

357
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,327
but it's pink
and really cute.

358
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,596
It's like a gay R2-D2.

359
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,766
Well, a gayer R2-D2.

360
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,569
Who wouldn't want
a cupcake from this?

361
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,072
No one.

362
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,506
- We have to mess her up.
- What?

363
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,875
Why are you carrying
spray-paint in your purse?

364
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,744
For the same reason
I carry a tampon.

365
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,279
'Cause you never know.

366
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,781
We are not gonna destroy
someone else's property.

367
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,583
Well,
we have to do something,

368
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,352
'cause it's that machine
or us.

369
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,653
Oh, I know.

370
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,023
We can open the little door
and put a poop in it.

371
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,858
Not one of mine.
Jeez!

372
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,626
What am I, a pig?

373
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,129
Well, I'm not doing it.

374
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,466
No, we just get some
puppy poop from the street.

375
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,567
No!

376
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,602
We are not
that desperate.

377
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,704
And I'm out of wetnaps.

378
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,907
No, see, we already
met Martha.

379
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,642
We're just stopping by
to say hi.

380
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,044
You've already
met Martha.

381
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,846
You're just stopping by
to say hi.

382
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:42,980
Yes.

383
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,482
Martha Stewart
asked us for our card.

384
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,184
Martha Stewart
asked you for your card.

385
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,619
And where should
I tell Martha

386
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,887
she asked for your card?

387
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,322
In the ladies' room.

388
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,090
Martha Stewart
asked you for your card

389
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,959
- in the ladies' room.
- Okay.

390
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,061
Don't make it sound like that.
It happened.

391
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,295
We cornered her
in the ladies' room and...

392
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,431
Okay, don't make it
sound like that either.

393
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,633
We went to a gala
on the off chance

394
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,868
that she would be
gracious enough

395
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,202
to try one of our cupcakes
and she did.

396
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,370
She was very gracious.

397
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,139
Yeah, maybe cornered
was the wrong word.

398
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,007
It's not like we went there
to hunt her down.

399
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,077
It's not like you went there
to hunt her down.

400
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,745
It's not.

401
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,147
Okay, I hear your tone.

402
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,848
I see what's
going down here.

403
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,517
You think I'm some
kind of a problem.

404
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,253
Well, for the record,
Martha came on to me.

405
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,988
All right. Okay.

406
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,323
This is not going as well
as we had hoped.

407
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,692
Don't know how it could
without my magic pearls.

408
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,994
Okay, look.

409
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,462
I get that you're not
gonna let us up there.

410
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,097
And I don't blame you,
what, with this one

411
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,632
talking about magic.

412
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,534
But just so you know,
we are not lying.

413
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,635
It happened.

414
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,803
And after
we hunted her down...

415
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,838
because, yeah,
you got us on that, we did...

416
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,273
Martha told us

417
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,042
she liked our
entrepreneurial drive.

418
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,711
Well, that does
sound like Martha.

419
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,847
Okay, I'll send these up.
Have a seat.

420
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,116
Ahh, thank you so much.

421
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,851
And here, uh,
please take one,

422
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,186
just so you can
see for yourself

423
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,821
why Martha
asked for our card.

424
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,589
Well, I was gonna
get a cupcake

425
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,257
from that cute machine
downstairs later.

426
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,525
Oh, don't.

427
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,093
I heard someone found
something nasty in that...

428
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,295
In about an hour.

429
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,529
Max.

430
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,565
And this is our
beer batter

431
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,834
maple bacon spring break
cupcake.

432
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,068
Mmm.

433
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,337
I can see why Martha...
Ow!

434
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,839
What the...

435
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,340
I cracked my tooth!

436
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,375
What?
Oh!

437
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,044
What is that?
Is it...

438
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,145
is that glass?

439
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,013
No, it's a pearl.

440
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,715
I'm so sorry.

441
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,817
Sorry?
You're sorry?

442
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,287
I've been wearing Invisaligns
for 11 months!

443
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,658
Well, there goes
our big break.

444
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,027
Never would've happened
if I had had my necklace.

445
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,429
The one
with the lucky pearls

446
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,064
that broke into the batter
and that woman

447
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,266
just spit into her hand
mixed with saliva and blood?

448
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,635
That lucky necklace?

449
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,537
Yes.

450
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,072
Might as well face it.

451
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,523
You and I are on our own.

452
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,992
And not just
because of Martha either.

453
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:53,394
Because there
is no such thing as good luck.

454
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,829
Never seen it.

455
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,764
And all lucky charms
are stupid,

456
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,566
except for <i>the</i> lucky charms,

457
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,135
which are magically delicious.

458
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:05,539
Look at it over there.

459
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,342
Gay R2-D2
just laughing at us.

460
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:09,443
You were right, Max.

461
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,645
You and I are
on our own.

462
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,546
We're just a little
start-up cupcake company

463
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,248
in a hard, hard world.

464
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,651
And we gotta take matters
into our own hands.

465
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,119
Cover me.

466
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,453
Wait, wait, no.

467
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,988
No, don't do it now.

468
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,390
- The guard is right there.
- Hey, you!

469
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,724
Stop that!

470
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,427
- What kind of freaks deface a cupcake machine?
- Run, run run!.

471
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:33,200
Okay, stop, stop, stop.
We lost him.

472
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,069
You know you only
tagged the wall, right?

473
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,837
Yes, I have no luck.

474
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,373
No one has any luck...

475
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,943
With the possible exception
of Lindsay Lohan's lawyer.

476
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,830
Look, it's Martha!

477
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,865
She's getting in that car.
Give me the cupcakes.

478
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,166
I'm going after her
before she talks

479
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,002
to that lady
whose mouth we broke.

480
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,839
Max, don't jiggle
the cupcakes!

481
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,207
Aah!

482
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,878
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

483
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,979
Max, are you all right?

484
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,347
Are you all right?

485
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,449
I'm fine.

486
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,384
No broken bones,

487
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,286
which is surprising,
because when I was kid,

488
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,821
we couldn't afford milk.

489
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,690
Actually the only time
my mother bought milk

490
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,725
was when my face
was on the side of the carton.

491
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,994
Are you sure
you're all right?

492
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,762
Yeah.

493
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,332
I guess there
is such a thing as luck.

494
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,003
And tomorrow night

495
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,872
when you come in
for takeout, Sophie,

496
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,241
all Max has to do
is hit this little thing.

497
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,176
Well, if I'm allowed
to hit little things,

498
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,644
you're next.

499
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,647
Change makes everyone
so tense.

500
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,651
Kitchen is now closed.

501
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,986
I have plans.

502
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,488
Big plans.

503
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,761
Sophie, I understand

504
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,463
your relationship with Oleg
is complicated,

505
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,964
so let's simplify it.

506
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,232
Are you having sex
in our building tonight,

507
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,535
and do I have
to wear earplugs?

508
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,603
I will be alone...

509
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,939
But wear them anyway.

510
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,176
Hi, um, sorry,
we're closed.

511
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,311
I do not wish to eat.

512
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,580
I just got collect call
from Oleg.

513
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,485
She said we are closed.

514
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,620
Oh?
And who are you?

515
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,756
I'm the last person
you will see

516
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,492
before you learn
how to walk again.

517
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,829
Stay away from Oleg,

518
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,699
or I'll pull your intestines
out through your nose

519
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,670
and give them to her
to wear as new necklace.

520
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,871
Fine.

521
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,039
I will leave.

522
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,941
But only because
you have eyes of a python,

523
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,043
and I have possible U.T.I.

524
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,714
Sophie...

525
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,550
Why don't you just admit it,
you and Oleg?

526
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,785
What?

527
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,520
It's not like I want him.

528
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,522
It's just that
where I come from,

529
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,824
you never
throw anything away.

530
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,261
Here you go, ladies.

531
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,964
Enjoy the extra tips
from your credit cards,

532
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,299
because when Han
flips that switch,

533
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,101
the only tip
I can give you is,

534
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,270
don't wash your hair
every day.

535
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,639
It dries it out.

536
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,575
Okay.
Here comes the future.

537
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,311
One, two...

538
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,185
This old building
sucks me so hard.

539
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,954
Congratulations, ladies.

540
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,223
This is your lucky night.

541
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,325
Speaking of luck,

542
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,060
here are your pearls.

543
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,062
I found most of them,
but I think

544
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,163
Chestnut ate a few.

545
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,698
You can dig for those
later yourself.

546
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,066
Max.

547
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,534
And it won't
look the same,

548
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,570
because you have to string them
on this cheap-ass wire

549
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,639
I got at the hipster
bead store...

550
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,575
Beading Off.

551
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,310
We can add this
Earl bonus money

552
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,578
to our cupcake business total.

553
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,613
Yeah, that 150
will really put a dent

554
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,548
in the 250,000 we need.

555
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,650
We'll get there, Max.

556
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,118
Because you and
I have something

557
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,020
Martha Stewart
and machines don't.

558
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,154
Unpaid bills?

559
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,256
Mushrooms growing
on our bathroom rug?

560
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,191
No, each other.

561
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,193
Aww, a year later
you're still

562
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,096
trying to get me
to feel things.

563
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,364
Do you wanna know
the real reason

564
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,500
I thought this necklace
was so lucky?

565
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,936
I was wearing it
the day I met you.

566
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,471
So, I'm gonna
have some extras

567
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,040
do you wanna
make one for yourself?

568
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,875
Nah, I've had
plenty of pearl necklaces,

569
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,878
and I find them
more sticky than lucky.

570
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,483
Max,
ms@marthastewartinc.com.

571
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,786
"Haven't forgotten
about you, girls.

572
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,287
Martha Stewart."

573
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,056
Just when
I thought I was out,

574
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,992
she pulls me
back in again.

575
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:40,029
