1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,770
Girls, I have made
a big decision.

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:07,156
You're having
a sex change?

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:09,659
I totally support you,
but be careful, Han.

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,445
Female to male
is very tricky.

5
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:15,780
Well, you would know.

6
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,001
Meow!

7
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,336
He must have already
started on the hormones.

8
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,623
Now, here's my big decision.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,159
We're moving from
those icky glass ketchup bottles

10
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,712
to modern, new squeeze bottles.

11
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:33,047
Wow, that is some fresh,
outside-the-box thinking.

12
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:37,551
It's like being an intern at
Apple during the summer of '76.

13
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:41,389
That's right.
Call me "Han Jobs."

14
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:50,479
Oh, I will only
call you "Han Jobs."

15
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,136

18
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:09,154
I can't believe
everybody else is gone,

19
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,573
and we're stuck here
doing this.

20
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:13,658
Eew, this has a really toxic
plastic smell.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,395
Give me that.

22
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:20,515
Max, are you huffing
a ketchup bottle?

23
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:22,617
Mmhmm. I'm hoping
it kills the brain cells

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:23,701
that'll remember I'm stuck

25
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:25,503
doing ketchups
on a Friday night.

26
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:27,171
Max, give it to me!

27
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,924
Whether you believe it or not,
you're above that.

28
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,993
And you know what?
We're above this.

29
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,795
Forget this.
Let's go out.

30
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:37,048
I mean, I'm newly single,
and you're not picky.

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,667
True.

32
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,302
I'm ready to let
my hair down

33
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:43,354
and have one of those crazy

34
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:45,523
yet fiscally responsible
kind of nights.

35
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:47,008
You mean
steal other girls' drinks

36
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,643
when they go to the bathroom?

37
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:49,894
Seriously, what can you do
in Williamsburg

38
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,613
if you have less than $20?

39
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,948
Hang out on the sidewalk
and look good till you turn 35.

40
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,952
Then turn to your friends
and say, "I have to move home."

41
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,788
Hey, you know what?

42
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,024
The Raveonettes are playing
the Lorimer Lounge.

43
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:05,526
We got a little tip money
and lot of deez.

44
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:08,713
So let's just
watch the magic unfold.

45
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:10,048
I haven't seen
the Raveonettes live

46
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,549
since I saw them in Denmark.

47
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,585
That is crazy
because I first heard of them

48
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:17,505
when I was dry-humping
a guy named Mark in his den,

49
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:19,040
so...

50
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:20,840
Twinsies!

51
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,983
Wow, my life
has really changed.

52
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,735
The last time I was
in an alley behind a club,

53
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:34,070
I was in an SUV
with one of the Olsen twins.

54
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,524
I still don't know
which one.

55
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,660
Hey, speaking
of the Olsen twins,

56
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:41,362
I once woke up
next to a garden gnome.

57
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:43,448
Well, so much
for our plan.

58
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,084
Yes, we've still got "doze,"
but no tickets.

59
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:47,785
There's gotta be a way
for us to get in.

60
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:52,674
What up, ladies?

61
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:56,009
Hi. Moo.
Whatever.

62
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:57,795
You need tickets?

63
00:02:57,797 --> 00:02:59,130
Well, Bessie,
we might be interested.

64
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,932
How much?

65
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:04,267
You can have 'em for free
if the blonde one milks me.

66
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:06,387
How bad do you want
those tickets, Caroline?

67
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,555
Ha, not that bad.

68
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,690
Bye. Moo.
Whatever.

69
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:12,694
Sorry, Max,
but I can't come back

70
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:14,645
from pulling
a strange man's teats.

71
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:17,980
You think that, and then
you do it, and it's not so bad.

72
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:22,151
Wow, New York without money
is like no magic.

73
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,907
There's magic all over
the city with or without money.

74
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,942
You just have
to make your own.

75
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,277
By drinking.

76
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,963
Oh. Purse beer.

77
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,781
Sorry there's
no purse nachos.

78
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:34,749
I ate them all.

79
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,117
Best I can do is, uh,

80
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:39,337
the cheese dust
down near the birth control.

81
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,093
Okay, this is ratchet.

82
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:47,929
We're just standing here
like a couple of beckys.

83
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:51,264
- Where's your magic now?
- Oh, you wanna see magic?

84
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,602
Abracadabra.

85
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:56,938
Let me in, dumbos.

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,273
Abra-ca-damn-dabra!

87
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,447
You know, I don't know
what that trash bin said to you,

88
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,999
but you make
a cute couple.

89
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,617
I think it'd be
a shame to break up

90
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:11,869
before you got to see
what your kids would look like.

91
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,838
Well, it's been
a rough couple of years for us,

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,373
what with me
considering grad school

93
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,925
and him being a trash can,
but what can I say?

94
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,094
- It's love.
- I understand.

95
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,046
Americans love
their garbage.

96
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,347
How else would you explain

97
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,682
<i>The Real Housewives</i>
<i>of... Everything?</i>

98
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:30,052
You're welcome
for Euro Disney, by the way.

99
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,441
My name's Graham.
I'm with the band.

100
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,026
Max.
I'm with the blonde.

101
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,728
You two can come
and hang backstage if you like.

102
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,948
Your boyfriend can stay outside
and get trashed.

103
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,283
Hey, ratchet-ass becky,
we're in.

104
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,265
Earl, I'm worried.

105
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,067
I haven't seen Max
since she left

106
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,735
with that guy last night.

107
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:02,221
I've called her a million times.
She picked up once,

108
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:05,441
and she was either having sex
or fighting a bear.

109
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:08,776
Don't you worry.
Max can take care of herself.

110
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:12,196
I once saw her push a truck
out of her way with her mind.

111
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,751
Hey, everybody.

112
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:21,090
Hey.
Pardon.

113
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,791
Pardon my appearance,

114
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:24,910
but I was just in the park

115
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:27,796
running after the high school
boys' track team.

116
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,965
I told her
it was fine with me.

117
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,718
I know she will never
catch one of them.

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,753
Oh, says you.

119
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:38,088
I'm going to the prom
with Brandon.

120
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:41,591
Yeah, if his--if his dad
will lend him the car.

121
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:45,314
Sophie, I always love
when you wear that outfit.

122
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,649
It makes me wanna Xana-do you.

123
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:49,769
'Sup?

124
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,020
Pip-pip and cheerio.

125
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,356
Max, thank God.
I was so worried.

126
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:55,958
Wait, why do you look
extra pretty?

127
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,410
Probably the new shades
I didn't pay for.

128
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:01,745
Or the hours of him
going Downton on my abbey.

129
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,366
Hold up.
No spoilers.

130
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:07,636
I haven't started
season three yet.

131
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,722
Earl,
you watch that show?

132
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:10,973
Yes, I do.

133
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:14,308
I enjoy any show
where the help is white.

134
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:18,848
So you slept
with that guy?

135
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,216
Oh, I really slept
with that guy.

136
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,935
You go, girl.

137
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:25,154
Don't stop
till you get enough!

138
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:27,857
I'm surprised
you spent the night.

139
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,558
Don't you usually leave
before they realize

140
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,444
there's nothing
in their wallet?

141
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:35,698
Last night you were
complaining about no magic.

142
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,733
Then I woke up this morning
to a view of the park

143
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:39,451
and hot cinnamon rolls.

144
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,787
Now I'm back at the diner
but full of cinnamon rolls.

145
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,039
Boom. Magic.
Suck it, David Blaine.

146
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,842
Well, at least you had fun.
The only fun I had last night

147
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,878
was when that cow dude
passed out on his feet,

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
and I tipped him over.

149
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,098
So are you
gonna see him again?

150
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,633
Sunday.

151
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:56,268
And I realize
you haven't heard these words

152
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,938
since you lost your money,
but you're invited.

153
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,357
So you're asking me
to be the third wheel

154
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:04,193
on a two-night
one-night stand?

155
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:07,279
So I guess a private plane
and two tickets

156
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,598
to the Grammys in L.A.
won't do it for you either?

157
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,784
'Cause, bitch, we're invited!

158
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:13,452
The Grammys?
That's so exciting.

159
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:15,321
Oh, and my self-esteem
could really use

160
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:18,656
being mistaken
for Taylor Swift right now.

161
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,777
Which tells you how low
my self-esteem is.

162
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,830
The guy is sending
a private plane for me.

163
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:26,081
A private plane!

164
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,967
That's how good
I am in bed.

165
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,836
- We're going to the Grammys!
- What is all of the excitement?

166
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,972
Han, we need the weekend off.
We're going to the Grammys.

167
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,808
The Grammys?
On the real-real?

168
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,626
Do you think
you'll meet 2 Chainz?

169
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,895
That's my boi!

170
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,314
No, he can't be your boi,
he's my boi.

171
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:44,800
2 Chainz is the man.
He sings my anthem.

172
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:47,603
<i>We represent</i>
<i>the lollipop guild?</i>

173
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:50,938
I'm talking
about his ode to big booty hos.

174
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:53,141
<i>Birthday Song</i> is my song.

175
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:55,494
No,<i>Birthday Song</i>
is my song.

176
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:57,246
Every morning
in the shower I rap

177
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:00,581
♪ All I want for my birthday
is a big booty ho ♪

178
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:05,119
Wow, that actually
makes you look whiter.

179
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,656
I'll give you
the weekend off

180
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,042
if you get him to sign
my concert T-shirt.

181
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:12,595
Well, we're never gonna
meet him, but done.

182
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:15,930
All my dreams
are coming true!

183
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,351
This is so exciting.

184
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:21,837
I am finally going
a plane ride.

185
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,939
Max, you've never been
on a plane?

186
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,524
I've never been
on a plane.

187
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:28,859
Max, even snakes
have been on a plane.

188
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:38,037
Good morning, Madame.
Welcome aboard.

189
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,322
It's a lovely day
for a flight, yes?

190
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,908
I am Agnes, and if there is
anything that you need at all,

191
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,127
you can just let me know.
Hmm?

192
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:47,329
Cool. Cool.

193
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,467
Please don't lag behind.

194
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:54,503
I just got French bombed, and I
have no idea what she said,

195
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,088
but I think
we should tip her.

196
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,673
Oh, my God.

197
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,891
I can't believe...

198
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,926
I'm back
on a private plane.

199
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:04,261
Max, thank you so much for
having sex with that stranger.

200
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,515
Aw,
it was my pleasure.

201
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,550
Literally.

202
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,353
Welcome aboard,
I am Agnes.

203
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,438
I can take those for you.

204
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,490
Do you have luggage?

205
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,525
Oh oui.

206
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:19,860
Thank you very much Agnes,

207
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:21,730
my name is Anne, she's Max.
-Oh, you are very pretty !

208
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,700
Oh, thank you.
I'm not Angelina Jolie.

209
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,568
I get that a lot.

210
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,570
You speak French
very well.

211
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:31,905
 Bravo, normally people have the right words, but with a terrible accent.

212
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,905
 But with you, it's like i were talking with my sister.

213
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:39,295
Oh i don't know if i'm able to talk as well as your sister,

214
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:43,095
 but i speak better than the majority of Americans


215
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,304
 who think that the french is...


216
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:46,605
"Le French fry."

217
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,112
That's all I know.

218
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,197
And every time
you ice me out with her,

219
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,598
that's what's coming
your way.

220
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,101
Okay, so how does
this work?

221
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,602
Do we need tickets?
Where do I sit?

222
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:01,620
Because I don't wanna
embarrass myself

223
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:03,122
in front of French stewart.

224
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,406
Max, there are
no seat assignments.

225
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:05,491
You can sit anywhere.

226
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:08,377
Oh, cool.
Like A.A.

227
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,445
I love a G5.

228
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:13,780
This reminds me so much
of the plane we used to have.

229
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:17,285
Wait, Max, this plane
looks very familiar.

230
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:19,388
Max, this was my plane.

231
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,423
Well, it's my plane now.

232
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:24,226
- Wait, if this was my plane...
- Which it isn't.

233
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:26,645
There'd be something I hid
down here for an emergency.

234
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,630
Money? Gold?
Kettle corn?

235
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:30,649
Yep.
My Chanel lip gloss.

236
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,651
Abra-ca-damn-dabra.

237
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:33,986
You were a billionaire,

238
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:35,938
and for an emergency,
you hid lip gloss?

239
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,356
Just in case
something went wrong.

240
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,474
I wanted to look good
if I was going down.

241
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:41,193
You know they don't care
what you look like

242
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,195
as long as you go down.

243
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:44,880
What the hell
is wrong with me?

244
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:46,281
I'm glossing
like a rich gal.

245
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:48,700
This has gotta last me
two years.

246
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:50,369
Would you like a towel?

247
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,254
How much?

248
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,539
Max, they're free.

249
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,657
Oh, like the doughnuts
at A.A.

250
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,159
Jeez, that's hot!

251
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,128
You should warn a bitch.

252
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,797
So sorry.
It's her first time on a plane.

253
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,132
 She's excited, wait till she drinks the Champagne (AOC;)[Both Giggles]

254
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,303
I hope she's not angry at me, but wait a minute, i'm getting the Champagne immediately...


255
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,343
Every time.

256
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:17,679
We only are waiting
for one more passenger,

257
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:18,947
and then we'll be departing.

258
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,016
Champagne?

259
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:22,568
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

260
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,352
Ooh, the last time
I had champagne

261
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:27,687
was at a Filipino wedding
I crashed at a Doubletree.

262
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:31,243
Another passenger?
I wonder who it could be.

263
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,861
Probably my mother.

264
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:34,529
Every time something great
is about to happen to me,

265
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,165
she shows up
and ruins it.

266
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,917
In 20 hours,
we went from beer in an alley

267
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,469
to Dom on a plane.

268
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,703
That's pretty magical.

269
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:45,038
Yeah, this could not
get any better.

270
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,643
Max, it did just get better.

271
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,845
That's 2 Chainz.
I can't believe it.

272
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,231
Good morning.
How y'all doing?

273
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,766
Cool. Cool.

274
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:57,152
All right.

275
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:59,154
Monsieur Deux Chainz,
good morning.

276
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:01,824
Coffee, water, champagne?

277
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:04,493
No, I'm really tired.
I just wanna crash.

278
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:06,111
Not the plane.

279
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:08,864
Do you have
any sleepy time tea?

280
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,999
"Sleepy time tea"?

281
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,451
That is so gangster!

282
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,336
Oh, we're moving.

283
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:17,671
Max, buckle your seat belt.
We're about to take off.

284
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:19,541
I'm a little scared.

285
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:22,177
What's it
gonna feel like?

286
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,796
Oh, that's it?
That feels familiar.

287
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:28,131
Guess I have a private plane
in my nightstand.

288
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,305
I can't believe this.

289
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,308
I'm standing in
a flying living room eating ham.

290
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,810
That's prosciutto
from Italy.

291
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,363
It's ham
from right over there.

292
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:43,899
And I'm about to go ham
on this ham.

293
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,450
It's been two hours.

294
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:47,619
When is 2 Chainz gonna wake up?
I want a picture.

295
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,488
You want him
to wake up for a picture?

296
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,323
I'll handle that.

297
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,077
Anything?

298
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,330
Nothing.
Do it again.

299
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:05,420
Wow, that sleepy time
really knocks you out.

300
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,005
He must have two-bagged it.

301
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,258
He's totally out.
Let's just do it.

302
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,143
Wait, we're just gonna
take his picture,

303
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:12,928
- nothing else, right?
- Yes.

304
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,012
Okay, 'cause I can see
how these things

305
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:15,597
can get out of hand.

306
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,316
- Okay, I'm first.
- No, no, no, I'm first.

307
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,401
It's my plane.
Well, actually it's my plane.

308
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:21,403
Was your plane.
It's mine now.

309
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:24,639
I had morning sex for it
with a leg cramp.

310
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:31,277
Wait, do another, do another.

311
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,085
Good one.

312
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,206
New Facebook default.

313
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,208
In fact, this is my new
default pic for everything

314
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,093
including my tombstone.

315
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:48,046
Since you did boobs, I'm gonna
put my booty in his face,

316
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:51,381
'cause all he wants for
his birthday is a big booty ho.

317
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:57,272
Closer.
I can't get both of you.

318
00:13:57,274 --> 00:14:00,607
Get closer.

319
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:03,845
I never get tired
of waking up like this.

320
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:07,780
Oh, Mr. Chainz,
I am so mortified.

321
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:10,352
I didn't wanna bother you.
I just gonna be cool.

322
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,037
Oh, that ship sailed
with the butt pic

323
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,206
and then crashed
with "Mr. Chainz."

324
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,376
I just wanted a picture
because I am such a huge fan.

325
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,211
And I wanted to wish you luck
tonight at the Grammys

326
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,363
because your music
means a lot to me.

327
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,498
And I totally related
when you said

328
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,335
♪ When I die bury me
inside the Gucci store ♪

329
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:27,719
- True.
- ♪ When I die

330
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,388
♪ bury me inside
the Louis store ♪

331
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,473
- Unh.
- ♪ All I want for my birthday

332
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:33,375
♪ is a big booty ho

333
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:36,710
♪ all I want for my birthday
is a big booty ho ♪

334
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,147
Yeah.

335
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,383
Hey,
what's the party, players?

336
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,268
I heard
"booty" and I heard "ho,"

337
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,903
so I had to do a pop-in.

338
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:48,238
Always some weird white guy
coming to crash a party.

339
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:49,941
Chainz.

340
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,060
Stop.
No way.

341
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,446
I can't believe
it's you flying this plane.

342
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,448
Caroline, it's been so long
since I've seen you.

343
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,367
- Bring it in.
- Oh, Max, this is Bill.

344
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,285
- The pilot.
- The pilot?

345
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,087
Why is he walking around?

346
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,756
Brace for crash!
Brace for crash!

347
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:06,875
It's okay,
it's on autopilot.

348
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,911
Autopilot.
That's how I live my life.

349
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:11,463
Pilot Bill is
an old pal.

350
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:13,548
He used to fly my friends
and I around in college.

351
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,517
Yeah, good times.

352
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,085
This is my friend, Max,

353
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,087
and it's her very first time
on an airplane.

354
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:20,439
Hey, mine too.

355
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:22,140
J.K.

356
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:23,692
Listen, Max, why don't you
take a stroll down there

357
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:24,810
and check out the cockpit?

358
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:25,977
The cockpit?

359
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,312
If it's anything
like the gay bar

360
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:28,897
on 14th street,
I'm not dressed right.

361
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,700
It is so good to see you.

362
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:34,102
And, God, I'd forgotten
how beautiful you are.

363
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:35,954
Oh, thank you,
Pilot Bill.

364
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:38,490
You know, I never thought
I had a chance with you before

365
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:41,493
because you had so much money
and I was 20 years older,

366
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,496
but now you're broke
and I had a facelift,

367
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,465
so we're kinda
on the same level.

368
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,717
Oh, a facelift?

369
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,419
That's why your face
is so tight and pink?

370
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:51,837
I thought maybe
you were in a fire.

371
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,672
But you look good.

372
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,757
- Sure, let's go out.
- Great.

373
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,842
I'm gonna grab a coffee.

374
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:00,011
I'll be right back.

375
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,848
What you doing going out
with a guy like that?

376
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,320
Well, here's the thing, 2.

377
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,238
You don't tell the pilot
flying the plane you're on

378
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,857
that you don't wanna
go out with him.

379
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,475
Got you.

380
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:15,494
You just keep flirting
with him until we land.

381
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:18,829
I gotta make it
to the Grammys.

382
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,833
So, Max, you've really
never been on a plane before?

383
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,502
Well, technically
it's my second time

384
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:26,204
if you count Rock-O-Plane ride
at the carnival.

385
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:28,206
Guess I was rockin'
that plane too hard,

386
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,375
'cause halfway
through the ride,

387
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:32,494
my mini-747 fell off its gears,
and I crashed to the ground.

388
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,329
There would have been
a lawsuit,

389
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:35,881
but the carnie paid me off
with a snow cone,

390
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:38,850
and also no one cared
about me as a child.

391
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:40,886
Well, go ahead,
put your hands on the wheel.

392
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,188
- Give it a spin.
- No, I'm good.

393
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,724
Wow, we are
really up there.

394
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:47,225
I have never been
this high.

395
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,528
And trust me,
I have been high.

396
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,845
Yeah, I hear that.

397
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:54,180
No one liked to get high
more than me.

398
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,785
I did everything--
pills, weed, coke,

399
00:16:56,787 --> 00:17:00,120
and what's that called when you
crumble the coke on your weed?

400
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:03,790
Anyway,
I loved to get high.

401
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,744
But that's all
way behind me now.

402
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:07,212
I've been clean
and sober

403
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,831
ever since that Denzel
<i>Flight</i> movie came out.

404
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,833
It's still
in the theaters.

405
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:14,035
Yep, saw it last week.

406
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,471
Maybe I will
put my hands on the wheel.

407
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:17,839
You know, just in case.

408
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:23,378
It's the carnival ride
all over again!

409
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,431
I broke the plane!
I broke the plane!

410
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,049
Okay, everything's
under control.

411
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:30,051
Just sit down, sit down.
Put your seat belt on.

412
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:33,386
And, uh, Caroline,
here's my cellular.

413
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,024
Of course, you can always still
get me at my mom's, so--

414
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:37,909
- Go save the plane!

415
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,111
Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:41,413
We'll be fine.

417
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:43,231
I was not meant to die
as the second banana

418
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,500
in a cross-country
booty call.

419
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,835
_

420
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:53,935
_

421
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:55,544
What did she say?

422
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,095
I have no idea.

423
00:17:57,097 --> 00:18:00,415
I heard "love" and "why now?"
So just in case.

424
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:03,134
I should tell you I took
$10 out of the cupcake fund

425
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,803
for a Big Mac
and never told you.

426
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,589
I should tell you I took $100
out of the cupcake fund

427
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,424
to keep my hair
this naturally blonde.

428
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,759
Okay, everybody.
We got a bit of a situation.

429
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:16,431
Looks like my new girlfriend's
friend broke the plane.

430
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,317
No, I'm just kidding.
We had some engine trouble.

431
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,153
We're going to have to make
an emergency landing in Kansas.

432
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,823
Go, Chiefs!

433
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:26,157
Hey, blondie.

434
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,826
Why don't you
keep us in the air?

435
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:30,996
How about you go give
the pilot a little love?

436
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,458
Okay.

437
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,676
Okay, thank you.

438
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:42,844
Well, good news.

439
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:43,928
We're not stranded here.

440
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,497
I just got off the phone,

441
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,299
and according to my new
boyfriend, Captain facelift,

442
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:51,186
your new boyfriend, the brit,
is flying us hg tomorrow

443
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:53,521
on a commercial flight.
Coach.

444
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,741
What?

445
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:59,994
I don't do coach.

446
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:02,814
And I am pretty positive
2 Chainz would have taken us

447
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:05,583
on that other plane they sent if
you hadn't rapped for 30 minutes

448
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:08,002
in that corn field
after we landed.

449
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:09,320
I don't care
what you say.

450
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,989
I burned
that corn field up.

451
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,324
Here, let's eat something.

452
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:14,542
They delivered the food.

453
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,661
Slim Jims, Cheez-its,
Pizza Pringles,

454
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:18,713
and two ham
and cheese sandwiches.

455
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:21,549
Ham?
Where's the prosciutto?

456
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:22,884
There is none.

457
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:25,053
<i>Mais pourquoi?</i>

458
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,388
Because we're
at a motel in Kansas.

459
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,391
And the lady at the front desk
called me a snob

460
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,777
for ordering
the Pizza Pringles.

461
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,447
I can't believe
I'm not at the Grammys,

462
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:38,782
and I'm stuck here eating a
lousy vending machine sandwich.

463
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:42,235
Well, it's better than doing
those ketchups in the diner.

464
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:45,290
And crash-landing
in a corn field with a rap star

465
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,243
with our heads still attached--
that's pretty magical, right?

466
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:50,879
Yeah,
and 2 Chainz did say

467
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:54,214
he enjoyed meeting us and that
we're two fine, big booty hos.

468
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,868
That's pretty magical.

469
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,053
Han's gonna be so jealous
when he finds out

470
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:00,805
I met our boy.

471
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,808
Oh, my God, we forgot to get
Han's T-shirt signed.

472
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,143
Or did we?

473
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:10,515
When you don't have enough money
to fix your own mistakes,

474
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:13,268
you've gotta make
your own magic.

475
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,387
Max, it's 2 Chainz
with a "z" not an "s."

476
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:19,557
Damn! The one time
I know how to spell something,

477
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,892
and it comes back
to bite me in the ass.

478
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,162
Ooh, it's starting.

479
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:27,497
Ready to go
to the Grammys?

480
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,571
Don't get
any ham on the dress.

481
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,573
We have to return these
to get our money back.

482
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:38,376
You think Beyonce's
saying that right now?

483
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,244
Hey, if we can make
our own magic,

484
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:42,263
- we can make our own Grammys.
<i>- The Grammys...</i>

485
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,432
Max Black, who are you wearing?

486
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:47,602
Who are you wearing?
My roommate's rent.

487
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:53,308
You're right,
this is pretty magical.

488
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,259
But wait,
I think it can get better.

489
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:56,844
<i>Beyonce,
Faith Hill, Kelly Clarkson,</i>

490
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:59,030
<i>Carrie Underwood,
Mumford & Sons, Keith Urban,</i>

491
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:00,448
<i>The Black Keys, Jack White,</i>

492
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,766
<i>and look who's opening up
the night--</i>

493
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,117
<i>Taylor Swift.</i>

494
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,238
See?

495
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,857
Way more magical.

496
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:12,376
You know, this kind of feels
like the private plane.

497
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:15,711
Yeah, the one I have
in my nightstand.

498
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:20,711
