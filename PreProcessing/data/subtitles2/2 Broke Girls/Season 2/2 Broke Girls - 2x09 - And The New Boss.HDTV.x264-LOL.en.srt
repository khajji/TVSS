1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,616
Hey, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom real quick.

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:03,634
I want to
look in the mirror

3
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05,202
and make sure
I'm still dead in the eyes.

4
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:08,988
You think you can
handle my section?

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,375
Uh, yeah,
I think I can handle it.

6
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:14,227
Hey, Earl,
I don't know if you noticed,

7
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:15,829
but I'm running
the whole diner right now.

8
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:17,931
What, what?

9
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,500
The customer at table ten
appears to be choking,

10
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:22,302
and I would help,

11
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:24,554
but the last time I gave
a white woman the heimlich,

12
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:27,507
I did six months
in the Birmingham city jail.

13
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,310
Oh, my God,
are you choking?

14
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:32,812
Oh, my God,
I feel like you're choking!

15
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:34,447
Is anyone here a doctor?

16
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,283
What am I saying?
I forgot where I am.

17
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,235
Has anyone here
ever seen <i>Scrubs?</i>

18
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:41,404
What do you do
when a girl is choking?

19
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:45,208
I just back up
a few inches.

20
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,494
What do we do?

21
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:49,713
What do we do?
This woman is choking!

22
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,555
Thank you so much.

23
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:00,256
You're welcome.
And feel free to tip me

24
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:03,010
what you think
your life's worth.

25
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,647
I feel 3 bucks

29
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,435
Here you go, guys.
I'm the only waitress.

30
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:21,986
Sorry you waited longer
for the burger

31
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:25,706
than you did for that
Cosby sweater to come back.

32
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:31,144
Max, look at my face.
I'm very upset.

33
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:32,879
Oh.

34
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,984
Is that what that means? I just
assumed you were constipated.

35
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,186
Caroline is late again.

36
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:41,037
And she better not use
your new cupcake shop

37
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,622
as an excuse this time,

38
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:46,126
'cause sister,
that crap ain't gonna fly.

39
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:47,660
First of all,

40
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:49,179
stop talking like you're
in a Tyler Perry movie.

41
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,764
And secondly,

42
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:53,517
Caroline's here;
She's in the kitchen.

43
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,435
Oh, really?
'Cause when I was in there,

44
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,887
you told me she was out here.

45
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,506
You play me, fool.

46
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,608
Stop talking like you're
in a Tyler Perry sequel.

47
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,642
And secondly--

48
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,478
I'll ask Earl.
Earl...

49
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,231
- Oop!
- Ow!

50
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,066
What happened?
Why did you scream?

51
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:14,654
I accidentally
sat on one of my boys!

52
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,490
Have you seen
Caroline tonight?

53
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:18,024
Of course I have, man.

54
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,210
I just saw her go down the hall
to the ladies room.

55
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:21,828
There. Happy?

56
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,799
You've solved the big mystery,
Shortlock Holmes.

57
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:29,736
Wait, she didn't
pick up any of her--

58
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:31,505
Caroline?

59
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:33,273
Can't talk now, Han.

60
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,058
And how many more times
do I have to ask you

61
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,610
to fix
this damn pie carousel?

62
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:37,978
I mean, the temp
just isn't cool enough,

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,713
and those tapiocas
are gonna turn bad.

64
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:41,848
If you do want a lawsuit,
just keep ignoring me.

65
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,216
Max, can I see you
in the kitchen

66
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:44,601
where I was
just a couple minutes ago

67
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:47,254
after I got out
of the ladies room?

68
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,739
Yeah, get on that
temperature thing.

69
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,274
There's so much mold
growing in there

70
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:54,077
that cherry pie's
gonna need a pap smear.

71
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,398
That was some ballsy,
bold, in-your-face

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,083
awesome lying.

73
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:03,286
I learned it
by watching you, Dad.

74
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,304
Had to lie.

75
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:06,072
We need every minute

76
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:08,375
we can steal away from here
to get the cupcake shop ready.

77
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:09,759
We still have to do
the second coat of paint,

78
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,596
figure out
tables and chairs...

79
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,764
What?
Didn't have time for lunch.

80
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,249
Oh, I don't care.

81
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:17,434
I'm surprised
you're using a spoon.

82
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,087
I just stick my face in it.

83
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,857
So, my brilliant idea
of how we get this all done

84
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,942
is we should
get an intern to help.

85
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:27,894
What? No.

86
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,646
I can't be a person
that has an intern.

87
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:32,866
I can barely be a person
that doesn't have an intern.

88
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:35,435
Max, all businesses
use interns.

89
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:38,271
We just have to post an ad
online at NYU or Columbia,

90
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:40,290
and we'll have
20 applicants battling it out

91
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,791
to do our grunt work
for credit.

92
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:42,709
You make it sound like

93
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,297
<i>The Hunger Games:</i>
<i>College Edition.</i>

94
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,883
Sorry, I'm against getting
people to work for free.

95
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,084
I'm with you, Max.

96
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:54,804
My people were interns
for 436 years.

97
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,843
I am just getting used to the
idea of having my own business

98
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:01,628
and now you want me
to be someone's boss?

99
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,263
I am not the boss.

100
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:06,433
I'm the person who talks
behind the boss's back.

101
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:08,184
Pick up.

102
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,469
Thanks.
Isn't Han a tool?

103
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:13,139
- Total tool.
- Yeah, a tiny tool.

104
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,809
Like the kind you fix
your eyeglasses with.

105
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,496
See?

106
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:21,698
That's my wheelhouse.

107
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,500
Look, I don't want to ask
someone to work for free.

108
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:24,834
We can do it all ourselves.

109
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,819
You want to do it
all yourself? Great.

110
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:29,122
I'll write everything
you need to do on a to-do list.

111
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:30,874
Why don't you to-do that?

112
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:33,627
And I will to-tear it up.

113
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,378
What're we tearing up?

114
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,163
'Cause if it's that ass,
I already got that covered.

115
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:39,966
Hi, Andy.
That's so sweet and dirty.

116
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:43,637
Easy, easy. What are you,
shipping off to war?

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,507
Here. Take this giant bag of
skittles and look the other way.

118
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,175
I'm not that easy.

119
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,061
Ooh, new mystery flavors?

120
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:53,980
We getting together
after you get off work?

121
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:55,365
It'll be really late.

122
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,183
Max and I still have to go
to the cupcake shop

123
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,285
and tape up the windows so we
can start the trim tomorrow.

124
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,737
Okay, I'm not
very good at painting,

125
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,373
but I can do this
while you paint.

126
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,724
Yeah.

127
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,526
Yeah, roll that paint
on that wall.

128
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,128
Oh...

129
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:15,602
You are so freaking cute.

130
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:18,005
Ugh, white people.

131
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:21,508
Look, why don't you guys
just get an intern?

132
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,809
That's what I did
when I opened my shop.

133
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,178
You two are like
evil warlords

134
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,431
mining the souls
of innocent zombies.

135
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,066
Oh, and keep your eyes peeled
at your store.

136
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:32,051
The janitor told me
he saw some rat droppings.

137
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,788
But all you gotta do
is set up some traps.

138
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,490
Oh, gross.
Who's gonna do that?

139
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:40,677
The intern?

140
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:45,615
So, Ruth,
you are a sophomore at NYU,

141
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,400
majoring in finance?
You know you're not

142
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:49,285
gonna get paid.
No money at all.

143
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:53,573
Yup, it's in internship.
I mean, it's all good, right?

144
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:57,076
It's all good
until you need money.

145
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:59,295
Well,
we're a startup company,

146
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:01,464
and we're launching
our very first retail store,

147
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:04,083
so there's a lot of details
that you'll be responsible for.

148
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,852
There's a lot
of carrying things,

149
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:08,388
maybe some trapping things.

150
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh, it's cool.
I have a car.

151
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:13,560
You have a car
and you want to be an intern?

152
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,944
How 'bout
if we switch places?

153
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,312
I'll be the intern
with the car,

154
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:17,530
and you can sit
on a broken folding chair

155
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:19,282
next to Donna Trump
over here.

156
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:22,101
Well, Max and I need to have
a little meeting right now,

157
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,787
so if you could go
over to the waiting room,

158
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,121
that'd be great.
Okay, Ruth?

159
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:26,790
I just wanna say

160
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:30,960
I know my name is weird,
but like it's too late, right?

161
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,713
Max, why are you
trying to convince her

162
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,998
to not be our intern?

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,750
Why are you not saying,

164
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:40,503
"You may get rabies and
bubonic plague from our rats?"

165
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:43,890
Don't mention the rats.

166
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:46,459
You're chasing them away.
And we do not have rats.

167
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,562
We have rat droppings.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

168
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,397
You're right,
the rats are probably

169
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,983
just coming in here
to use the bathroom.

170
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:58,304
Look, we need an intern.
Now, who do you like so far?

171
00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:59,972
The one
with the big boobs.

172
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:03,827
I knew it. All you big boob
people stick together.

173
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,613
Hi, girls.

174
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,481
Are you having
a beauty contest

175
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:11,868
and didn't invite me to give
the other girls a chance?

176
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,120
We're interviewing people
to be our intern.

177
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:16,122
Who doesn't get paid.

178
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:18,424
Well, this is for you.

179
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:20,677
You didn't
have to do that.

180
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,495
You already gave us
the money for the shop.

181
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,881
I know,
I'm too wonderful.

182
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:26,266
But it's for good luck,

183
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,051
and sounds like
you're gonna need it.

184
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:31,504
Oleg says that it's
rat central station around here.

185
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,891
Not rats, Sophie,
just rat droppings.

186
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,026
Oh, just rat droppings.

187
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:40,947
Oh, okay, no problem there.

188
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,183
Are you out of breath

189
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:47,954
because you jogged here
all the way from 1974?

190
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,789
Sexy, huh?

191
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,960
You should see
his badunkadunk when he jogs.

192
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:56,830
Well, here they are.
60 rat traps.

193
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:01,718
Girls...

194
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,087
I don't want to interfere
with your business,

195
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,557
but what the hell
is goin' on here?

196
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:10,393
There's no fancy tables
or pretty chairs.

197
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:12,846
I mean, this place
is so unappealing,

198
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:16,933
even I don't look good here.

199
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:21,888
No worries.

200
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,407
We have some adorable old-school
ice cream tables and chairs

201
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,660
on hold at a kooky,
fun Staten Island junkyard.

202
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,495
Wow.

203
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:30,914
I can't believe you didn't
just shoot a blood clot

204
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,000
trying to make
dump furniture sound cute.

205
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:38,171
Okay, girls, well, call me
when you have a real business.

206
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:40,123
Yeah, and I'm--
I'm gonna take this,

207
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,091
you know, so that the rats
don't poop in it.

208
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,945
Come on, badunkadunk.

209
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,881
Oh, and, uh, Max...

210
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:50,683
Oh, she's good. Yes.

211
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:54,854
I knew it. All you big boob
people stick together.

212
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,360
Well?

213
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:03,162
Here we are.

214
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,031
The final three.

215
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,704
Well, you know the one I like.
I'll give you a clue.

216
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:14,040
One, two.

217
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,876
Standing in front of me
I see two beautiful,

218
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,661
qualified young women.

219
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,464
Is she really
going all <i>Top Model</i> right now?

220
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:24,634
If only. They pay.

221
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,554
I'm out, Tyra.

222
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,456
Ruth, congratulations.

223
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,975
You've been selected
to be our intern.

224
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:34,645
Max, will you get Ruth
started on something?

225
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:37,647
Yup,
I got the internship.

226
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,631
Um...

227
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,166
You know what?
I got it.

228
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:42,769
It's not like
you're getting paid.

229
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:46,106
Big boob people
are so much easier.

230
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:01,758
As a kid,
people told you

231
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,927
everything you did was amazing,
didn't they?

232
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,929
I was given a lot
of positive reinforcement.

233
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,481
I think it gave me
the confidence

234
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,316
that's gotten me
through this last year.

235
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,919
Well, it's time
you heard the truth.

236
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,287
You stink at stuff.

237
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,439
Like painting.

238
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,941
Fine.
And you stink at stuff too.

239
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:21,194
Like telling an intern
what to do.

240
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:23,062
Ruth had to go
to that concert.

241
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:25,031
She had the tickets
for weeks.

242
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:28,100
It was Ashley D and Ashley B's
joint birthday. Duh.

243
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:29,986
And so the intern's
out having fun,

244
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:34,657
and here we are, the bosses,
painting the walls at 3:00 a.m.

245
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:35,958
Well, I'm painting.

246
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,294
You got a kind of
autistic ballerina thing

247
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,713
going on over there.

248
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,114
Can I ask you something?

249
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't like Maroon 5.

250
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,451
No matter
how many times you ask,

251
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:47,336
the answer
will always be no.

252
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,055
Not that.

253
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,290
Would it be okay if I told Andy
not to come over tonight

254
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,892
'cause I'm so exhausted,

255
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,011
or is it a little too early
in the relationship to be all,

256
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:58,297
"I don't think I can have my
legs up around my ears tonight"?

257
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,300
It's fine.

258
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:01,133
You don't think
he'd enjoy a night off

259
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,936
from constant Maroon 5
badgering? He would.

260
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:06,605
Feels awkward. Can't.

261
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,857
My legs can go up there.
They're fine.

262
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:11,410
I don't want to have that
conversation right now.

263
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,945
Hey, look, I get it.

264
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:14,514
There are conversations
you don't want to have.

265
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:18,368
Like, "hey, Ruth, here's $0.
Put down some rat traps."

266
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,587
We have a box right here
that's not touched.

267
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:22,622
Look, we're not talking
about your relationship anymore.

268
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,591
We're done.

269
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,210
Relax. It's probably not even
a rat, it's probably a mouse.

270
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:30,129
Not a big deal.

271
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:33,049
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
I see it! There it is!

272
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,251
- The mouse?
- That is not a mouse!

273
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,637
That is a car
that a mouse drives!

274
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,189
Where did you see it?
It was in the middle, right?

275
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,392
- Shh!
- Why are you whispering?

276
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:43,926
I don't want him
to hear me.

277
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:45,111
How do you know it's a he?

278
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:47,947
He looked at me
kind of rapey.

279
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,099
There!
He just ran behind the thing!

280
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,484
- What thing?
- That thing!

281
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:53,736
This thing? Waah!

282
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:55,038
What? Did you see it?

283
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,706
I don't think so.

284
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,790
Oh, you'd know so.
It has a saddle.

285
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,280
Oh, my God.

286
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:08,167
He just opened the door with
the strength of his whiskers.

287
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,221
He's gone.
He went into the kitchen.

288
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:13,256
Oh, what should we do?

289
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:14,791
Should we call the cops?

290
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:17,260
He doesn't have a gun.

291
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:18,761
Let's just get out of here.

292
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,680
We'll call an exterminator
in the morning.

293
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,117
Too late,
he's coming back!

294
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,736
- Aah! He's charging us!
- He's gonna bite me!

295
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:37,080
Waah!
You can stop now!

296
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:40,833
You painted him to death.

297
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,876
I just got a glimpse of you
at a Barneys sample sale.

298
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:53,029
What a mess.
Who's gonna clean that up?

299
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,966
The intern?

300
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,670
Oh, Andy...

301
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:04,340
I know.
I'm good at this.

302
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,228
What?
Is there another rat?

303
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,947
What are you doing?

304
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:14,066
I forgot Andy was here!

305
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:18,270
And your sex voice is the same
as your murder voice.

306
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,157
So are you just
gonna stand there?

307
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,661
Are you offering me
a three-way?

308
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,151
Well, it looks like we're
about to be a full-blown orgy.

309
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:34,653
It's 2:00 a.m.
Who could this be?

310
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,788
It's Ruth.

311
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,858
- Ruth?
- Yes. I'm late, right?

312
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,710
Why is she here?

313
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:43,713
I texted her and said
you needed an enema.

314
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,799
Okay, now, this is some
industrial-strength girl talk.

315
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:49,268
I had to do something
to show her who was boss.

316
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,270
I learned it while interning
at Condé Nast.

317
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:53,022
We've all
gotten someone an enema

318
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,857
in the middle of the night,
it's a rite of passage.

319
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,393
For someone to get
their passage right?

320
00:13:57,895 --> 00:13:59,061
Beat me to it.

321
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,150
There. Go open the door.
You know what has to happen.

322
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,936
Max has to put Ruth
in her place

323
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:09,205
so she can learn
how to be a boss.

324
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:10,823
Oh. That's all? Good.

325
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,124
'Cause I thought
from your tone

326
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:13,993
you were gonna force Max
to have an enema.

327
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:15,828
Sorry I'm late.

328
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,999
I had the tiniest pot cookie and
had to pull over to take a nap.

329
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:24,303
Anyway, here is your enema.
Enjoy.

330
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:26,121
They only had
the triple pack.

331
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:27,523
Wait, Ruth?

332
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,291
Max has something
she wants to say to you.

333
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,143
Max, what did you
want to say to Ruth?

334
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:35,014
Um,
thanks for the triple?

335
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,018
Three times the fun.

336
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:44,407
You sure you don't want me
to help you with that?

337
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:46,025
Oh, no, it's okay.

338
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,444
You took the rat traps out
of the box, you need a break.

339
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,745
Plus, we couldn't afford

340
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,414
the game <i>Mouse Trap</i>
when I was a kid,

341
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,749
and this is the closest
I'm gonna get.

342
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,035
So, when do you
make the cupcakes?

343
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:57,837
Um...

344
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,755
I guess I could
make them now.

345
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:01,340
Fun.
I'll go get the coffees, right?

346
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,009
Sure, of course.
Do whatever.

347
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:05,879
You got a life.
Who am I to tell you what to do?

348
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:09,098
Well, here's our
Martha Stewart blurb,

349
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,601
all blown up and ready to roll
out and paste up on that wall.

350
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:14,971
- Where's Ruth?
- She's in the kitchen.

351
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:17,723
- I was just in there.
- Then she's in the bathroom.

352
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,843
Oh, my God,
you're Haning me!

353
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:23,178
She took a coffee break.

354
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,315
What? She didn't need a break.
She just started 20 minutes ago.

355
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,367
Your rich
is really coming out,

356
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,536
and it is not pretty.

357
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,154
Forgot my phone.

358
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,890
I mean, get it together,
Ruth, right?

359
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,542
Watch and learn.

360
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,462
Ruth, can you put the rat traps
down, one in each corner,

361
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:42,248
and then you can get coffee
later after interning.

362
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,532
Thanks.

363
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,669
She's kind of a tool,
right?

364
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,557
Max, were you
saying something?

365
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,508
Nope.

366
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,976
Ouch!

367
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:56,512
Right?

368
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,564
Oh, look at this cage.

369
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,851
I think my mom
used to dance in it.

370
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:12,103
Here they are.

371
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,989
These are the ones
I had the guy hold for us.

372
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:17,141
Only $600 for all of them.
What do ya think, Daddy?

373
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,945
I like 'em, doll.
Wrap 'em up.

374
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,114
And can Daddy
get something he wants?

375
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,333
So cute.
Over the counter?

376
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,669
And that way when I'm
hungover and taking a nap,

377
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:29,421
people can still
find the cupcakes.

378
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,506
We could
have Ruth clean it

379
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:33,008
and then paint
and reupholster these.

380
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,342
By the way, where is she?

381
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,327
She was supposed to
be here an hour ago.

382
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,329
Text her and find out
where she is.

383
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,016
Why are you so interested in
where she is, what she's doing?

384
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,701
Are you obsessed with her?

385
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:45,403
Max, I don't want to make
a purse out of her skin.

386
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,138
I just want her
to do her job.

387
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,441
Never mind.
I'll just text her.

388
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,975
Well, be careful.

389
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,111
Don't delete any
of my penis with a hat pictures.

390
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,679
Even if I did,
it's not a big deal.

391
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,981
Oleg will always pose again.

392
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:00,652
Yeah, but I'll never get
that little pilgrim hat back.

393
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:04,205
"Where are you?
We needed you here yesterday."

394
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,458
All in caps,
'cause bosses talk in caps.

395
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,544
Total tool.

396
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,212
Look at that.

397
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,631
Texted right back,
'cause I'm the boss.

398
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,300
She says...

399
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,752
Yesterday was super hard
so she's not feeling great

400
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,704
and she can't come in today?

401
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,473
That's it. She's fired.

402
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,007
Here.
You have to fire her.

403
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,444
She said she was sick,
Condé Nasty.

404
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,147
She's not sick,
she's just taking advantage

405
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,598
'cause you're
too friendly with her.

406
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,233
She works for us.

407
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,218
Yeah, for free.

408
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,603
Why don't you just
hollow her out

409
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:38,239
and live inside of her,
you monster?

410
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:44,913
Um, I don't think
we were supposed to get this.

411
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:47,499
"The dumb one wants me to pick
up all this crappy furniture.

412
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,868
"Right? As if.

413
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,787
I'll be at the bar in ten.
Order me a Bellini."

414
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,506
Oh, who's the monster now?

415
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,257
She just called you
the dumb one.

416
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,094
Uh, she called you
the dumb one.

417
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:01,463
It's your phone,
you're the dumb one.

418
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:03,681
She knows I don't talk
in caps, so that's to you.

419
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,016
You're the dumb one.

420
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,351
- Fire her.
- No, you fire her.

421
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,585
No, you fire her.

422
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,354
No, you hired her,
you fire her.

423
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,473
I wanted to go
with Molly big boobs.

424
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:14,976
She'd be here right now
with four chairs on each boob.

425
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:16,478
Why can't you
just fire her?

426
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,229
It's clear she called you
the dumb one.

427
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,615
All right, fine, I know
she called me the dumb one.

428
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:23,935
But I can't fire her.
I want to, but there is a block.

429
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,620
Right here.

430
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:28,406
It comes up, and then goes,
"nope!" It goes right back down.

431
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,292
I am not supposed to
fire someone.

432
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:34,445
I am the someone
who's supposed to be fired.

433
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,548
So I guess
I'm the boss, then.

434
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,050
Sounds like a plan.
I'll be in my mom's cage.

435
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,421
All right, come on,
you lowly worker.

436
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,456
Help the boss
pull these chairs out.

437
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,026
Don't yell at me, boss.
I'm blocked.

438
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,311
Wish you had your enemas now,
don't you?

439
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,735
They followed us!
We walked into a trap!

440
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,187
It's a vendetta!

441
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:00,638
Ugh, I can't believe this!

442
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,990
Our intern's
out having cocktails

443
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:03,441
and I'm trapped
on top of rat mountain!

444
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,810
He's coming after me!

445
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,229
Whoa--whoa!

446
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,914
Oh, my God!

447
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,417
Max! Help!

448
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,152
No, you bastards!
Get off her!

449
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,721
Aah!

450
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,373
Get off!

451
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,508
My foot's caught
under this thing!

452
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,549
Aah!

453
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,334
Max, that was amazing.

454
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,271
You just lifted that
giant thing up with one hand.

455
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,556
I know.

456
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,810
And now I'm gonna
fire that bitch!

457
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:45,567
Wow. You suck at this too.

458
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:47,002
Sorry I'm late.

459
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:48,903
I was having a dream
that I was sleeping in,

460
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,990
then I woke up,
and I was.

461
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,528
Who's the boss?

462
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,163
Tony Danza?

463
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,666
No, Max, who's the boss?

464
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,885
I am.

465
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,770
Have a seat, Ruth.

466
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,204
Here?

467
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,140
Good call.

468
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,260
In addition to being a boss,

469
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,895
I am also a waitress.

470
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,547
But when I do my job,
I don't call people dumb.

471
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,716
All right, I do, but at least
it's to their face.

472
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,768
Oh, you're talking
about that thing?

473
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,220
I meant Caroline.

474
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,721
No, I know you meant me,

475
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,357
because I'm not dumb
and neither is Caroline.

476
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,559
And one thing I figured out
is that in business,

477
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,394
maybe I have to be
a little more ruthless.

478
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,248
Meaning no more Ruth.
You're fired.

479
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,401
So, I'm not
getting college credit?

480
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,504
I'll probably
get kicked out of school again,

481
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,773
but no worries, right?

482
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,246
I'm really proud of how
you stuck up for yourself.

483
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,017
You're fired.
Sorry, I can't stop.

484
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,554
Look, Max.

485
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,141
We're on our way.

486
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:06,141
