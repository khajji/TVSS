1
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:05,783
- Max?
- No.

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,000
Don't come over here with that
"I'm the boss,

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,201
"you're the waitress" look.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,674
Cause I could just as easily give you
the "I'm the murderer,

5
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,480
"you're the victim" look.

6
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:16,356
The muscular woman at table two

7
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:17,840
is sending her bagel back.

8
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:19,809
She said she ordered
a plain one.

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,195
I'm sorry, did you say
she wanted a multi-grain?

10
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:22,937
No, plain.

11
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:23,816
Whole grain?

12
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:24,955
No, plain.

13
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,726
Garlic?
No.

14
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:28,651
The plain! The plain!

15
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:34,491
It took me two years,

16
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,076
but I finally got him
to say it.

17
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,047

<i>Are you telling me</i>
<i>you don't hear that cat?</i>

20
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:02,820
We have to let it in.

21
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,555
It's clearly a stray,

22
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:09,360
or this Marine I met last week
at a blood drive.

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,996
Last week there was a man
outside our door screaming,

24
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:13,397
"I've been stabbed,"

25
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:16,167
and all you did was yell,
"Shut up."

26
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:23,908
Because he said, "I think
I've been stabbed."

27
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,610
You're either stabbed,
or you're not stabbed, my friend

28
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,515
Listen, it sounds like
the cat's saying hello.

29
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,455
Hello, hello.

30
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,293
Listen, it's talking.

31
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:45,930
It's saying, "Help.
Can I come in?"

32
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,231
Really?

33
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,599
'Cause I think it's saying,

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,635
"I'm fine.
Go back to sleep."

35
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:54,939
Come on, it clearly just said,

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,141
"Let me in.
Ignore the blonde.

37
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:59,210
She's a bitch."

38
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,078
Look, you can't just
let in everything

39
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,947
that shows up at our door
and says hello.

40
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,748
Yeah, I can.
I've done it.

41
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,584
Max, we can't.

42
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,319
We can't become cat ladies.

43
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,421
And it always starts
out innocently,

44
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,789
rescuing a stray,

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,157
but then you have
to get another one

46
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:14,291
so that they can
entertain each other

47
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,559
while you're at work.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,727
And then somewhere
along the line,

49
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:17,995
four more sneak in,
and you think,

50
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:19,496
"We're good.
We're cool.

51
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:21,131
We're the cute girls
with six cats."

52
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:24,001
And then, one day, there
you are on <i>Animal Cops,</i>

53
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:27,438
screaming,
"Don't take my babies!

54
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,408
These 27 angels
is all I got!"

55
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,346
That's how it goes, Max.

56
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:38,315
Once you get one, you get 27.

57
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,416
Not true.

58
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,417
Really?

59
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,418
How many garden gnomes

60
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,320
do you have under your bed?

61
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,689
27.

62
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,258
What?

63
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,259
They understand
I'm only keeping them there

64
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,095
until I get a yard.

65
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:53,264
Come on.
I want a kitty.

66
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,199
Kitty for Max.
Kitty for Max.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,201
Max, we already have a horse.

68
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,702
We can't afford another animal.

69
00:02:58,703 --> 00:02:59,770
We're broke.

70
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,771
Come on.

71
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,373
Chestnut needs a friend.

72
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,375
He is dying to
trash us to someone,

73
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:05,676
and all he's got is that rat

74
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:08,345
who is super
self-involved.

75
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,347
Who the hell is that?

76
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,382
It's so late.

77
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,983
It's probably the cat,

78
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,318
or the guy who's raping
girls in Brooklyn.

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,721
Open the door,
and roll the dice.

80
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:20,090
Oh, please.

81
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,796
Please, somebody tell me

82
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:29,800
they killed that damn cat.

83
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,636
And where did it learn
how to say hello?

84
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:33,971
Told you.

85
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,640
It's been keeping
me up all night.

86
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,209
This poor cat has been
crying at our door

87
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,744
<i>every night trying to get in,</i>

88
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:41,912
trying to get
a little warm milk,

89
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,847
maybe a skosh of tuna.

90
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,984
Max, that's our
dinner tomorrow.

91
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:48,752
Wait.
Be careful.

92
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:52,056
A cat is not always a cat.

93
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,825
Oh, please continue.

94
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:57,995
In Poland, we believe
if you die outside,

95
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:02,066
you're reincarnated as a cat.

96
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,701
Am I the only one
who thinks Poland

97
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,337
sounds like a real freak show?

98
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,938
So never let a cat in,

99
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,939
because it's just a person

100
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,941
that's been reincarnated

101
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:14,411
and will bring in
all the bad jus.

102
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,415
I think you mean juju.

103
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,051
Oh, do I?

104
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,287
Nighty-night.

105
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,757
Look, we just have to put up
with it,

106
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:28,892
and after a while,
it'll go away on its own.

107
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,461
Go away on its own?

108
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,863
It's a stray cat,
not my father.

109
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:34,798
Good night, Max.

110
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,700
Fine.
No kitty for Max.

111
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,835
No kitty for Max.

112
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:44,375
See, Max, I told you
the cat would stop.

113
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:47,144
Max?

114
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:50,647
Max.

115
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,649
Can we keep it, ma?
Can we keep it?

116
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,390
Earl, you don't want
a cat, do you?

117
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:00,824
A cat?
God, no.

118
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:03,961
Cats steal your weed.

119
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,129
See, Caroline?

120
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,730
Nobody wants the cat.

121
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,399
We're keeping it,

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,734
and I think we should start
celebrating right meow.

123
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:13,170
Max, you didn't even try
to convince him.

124
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,238
Come on, Earl.

125
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,339
Don't you want a cat?

126
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,741
Kitty for Earl.
Kitty for Earl.

127
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:19,143
I'm too old to have a cat.

128
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:20,844
I'm about six months away

129
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,080
from crapping in a box myself.

130
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,252
Oleg, how do you
feel about cats?

131
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:32,990
Loved it.
Saw it nine times on Broadway.

132
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,024
Very clever show,

133
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:35,659
but a little expensive.

134
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,163
The most I've ever paid
to see a pussy dance.

135
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:46,537
So far we're keeping the cat.

136
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,172
Hey, Han, do you want a cat?

137
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:51,008
You could finally have
a friend your own size.

138
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,343
Come on, you could
ride it to work.

139
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,379
No, I can't have a cat.

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,147
They're lazy, moody,
and judgmental.

141
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,452
I don't need another you.

142
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,554
Plus, they don't
show affection.

143
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,289
Sure they do.

144
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,024
You just have to know
how to get it out of them.

145
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:09,293
Cats love to be lightly
spanked on their bottom.

146
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,029
I don't understand why
a cat would like that.

147
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,531
It's so mysterious.

148
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,867
Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

149
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:20,504
Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

150
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,306
Hmm.

151
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,240
Well, I can't have a cat.

152
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:26,310
I work all the time.

153
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,379
Why did I like that so much?

154
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,747
I don't know.

155
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:32,483
Something with boobs
was touching you.

156
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:34,418
People with boobs touch me.

157
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,253
She means aside from your mom.

158
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,754
Then, no.

159
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,859
Well, we've asked
everyone we know,

160
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,727
and now I'm depressed,
because this

161
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,729
is everyone we know.

162
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,264
Let's start asking people
in the diner.

163
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,832
We need to find it
a place to live.

164
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,400
Why?

165
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,735
Why can't it live
right here in my arm

166
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:55,105
in between my hot and naturals?

167
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:57,508
Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

168
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,844
I have to admit, that
does feel kind of good.

169
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:02,546
<i>Excuse me.</i>

170
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,881
I overheard you two
asking people

171
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,282
if they want a cat,

172
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,418
and I'd really love one.

173
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,053
Really?
Well, we have your cat.

174
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,855
Whoa. Whoa.
Not so fast.

175
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:13,056
I got a couple
of questions first.

176
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,091
Do you smoke?

177
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:15,092
Yes.

178
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,173
- Drink?
- Yes.

179
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:17,286
Prescription drugs.

180
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,287
Occasionally.

181
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:20,086
Forget the cat.

182
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,557
Will you take me home?

183
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:31,762
Kitty, you're gonna
love this lady.

184
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,511
She smokes, drinks,
does prescription drugs,

185
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,634
which we all know means Oxy.

186
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:37,802
Hi.

187
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,204
Oh, my God.
These she is.

188
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:43,407
She's purr-fect.

189
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:46,517
Come in.
Welcome home, you.

190
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:47,878
See, Max?
It's great.

191
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,583
What the hell is
going on in here?

192
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,453
<i>Look at all these cats</i>

193
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:55,454
<i>crammed in this little space.</i>

194
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:56,956
It's so sad.

195
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:58,624
The only thing missing
is Sarah McLachlan

196
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,826
singing in the corner.

197
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:01,827
What?
It's fine.

198
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:02,862
There's not that many.

199
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:05,531
They're attacking!

200
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:08,300
Sorry.
He loves blondes.

201
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,403
And apparently pooping
on the carpet.

202
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,705
No, Twinkles, no.

203
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,874
Oh, okay, quick introductions.

204
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,876
That's Bethany,
Radford, Cellars,

205
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,377
Franklin, Eleanor,

206
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,146
Pudding, Mustachio,
Mitzi, Meredith,

207
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:22,214
Baxter, Bernie.

208
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,483
She remembers
all of their names?

209
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,051
I don't even remember
the name of the guy

210
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,486
I lost my virginity to.

211
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,555
Best I can do
is "Coach" something.

212
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,524
Well, Catherine,
I think it's lovely

213
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,693
that you have such a big,
loving hairy family,

214
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,696
kind of like the Kardashians.

215
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,332
There's only 24.

216
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,402
Oh.

217
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:46,272
31.

218
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:48,574
Let's go before one of
these rabid cats bites us

219
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,709
and we become half-human,
half-cat hybrids

220
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,345
who wander the streets
but are never cold.

221
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:55,181
We're just gonna go have
a little conversation

222
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,348
in the hall.

223
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,850
And F.Y.I.,
the mother looks

224
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,885
like she's eating
the little one.

225
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,854
Just a thought.

226
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,389
I'm only saying that
'cause it's in her mouth.

227
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,125
Mitzi, release!

228
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:07,126
Let's go!

229
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,194
In less than five minutes,

230
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:09,595
it went from 24 to 31,

231
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,863
and I saw two cats
in the corner

232
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,565
doing it doggie style,

233
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,767
so in two months, we could
be looking at 50 cats.

234
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:18,137
Max, you can't get pregnant
doggie style.

235
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:19,972
Right?

236
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,611
We can't go back in.

237
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:26,946
There's so much hair in there,

238
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:30,583
I saw a cat using
a lint roller.

239
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,051
Okay, but if we don't
leave her here,

240
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:33,385
we only have one other option.

241
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,754
No, Kitty is not
going to a shelter.

242
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,257
Why?
Lots of cats get adopted

243
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:39,625
and end up in beautiful homes.

244
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,794
Look, I didn't want
to say this,

245
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:45,064
but she's not pretty enough.

246
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:46,599
What are you talking about?

247
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,568
She's not pretty enough.

248
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:53,105
Come on, she doesn't have
classic good looks,

249
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,341
but she's adorkable.

250
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,742
We cannot take her
to a shelter.

251
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,110
She'll die there.

252
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,778
And, yeah, everyone
says they want one

253
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,514
with a nice personality,

254
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,516
but they really just want
a hot, sexy, young kitten

255
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:05,651
who still gets excited
about balls in her face.

256
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:10,823
Everything okay, ladies?

257
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:13,259
No, everything
is far from okay.

258
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,627
My boots are now UGGs,

259
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:16,662
thanks to all
the cat hair in there.

260
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,664
Ow!
Stop it!

261
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,533
Sorry, that's Gina.

262
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,535
She's bipolar, and she refuses
to take her meds.

263
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,470
Ow! Ow!
Stop it, Gina!

264
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:25,638
I'm sorry, Catherine.

265
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,639
This isn't gonna work out.

266
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,040
It's nothing personal.

267
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,708
It's just that you're crazy.

268
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,310
Truly, I'm heartbroken.

269
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,811
Ow! Ow!

270
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,547
I already have a name
picked out for her.

271
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:35,714
Veronica Two.

272
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,449
Ow! Stop it!

273
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,984
Ow! Ow!

274
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,185
I got to go!

275
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,221
Who wants to eat?

276
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,391
Um, just so we all know,

277
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,961
Veronica One committed
suicide, right?

278
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,697
Kitty, we're gonna
find you a nice home.

279
00:10:57,304 --> 00:11:00,739
Want a cat?

280
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,143
Free cat?

281
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:07,680
Want a cat?

282
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,348
You are going to love it here.

283
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:13,719
Park Slope is like the
Beverly Hills of Brooklyn.

284
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,521
Here comes a good one.

285
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:18,090
Hey.
Want a cat.

286
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,158
Excuse me?

287
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,860
Cat?

288
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,430
Yeah, I'll take some crack.

289
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,864
She said "cat."

290
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,167
We're looking for
a nice home for a cat.

291
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:29,268
Oh, so no crack.

292
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,536
No.

293
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:32,004
Well, why would I want a cat?

294
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:33,439
I'm a crackhead.

295
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:37,943
Well, Kitty,

296
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:39,211
as hard as this is,

297
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:40,412
I think it's time to let you

298
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:41,947
back out there into the world.

299
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,716
At least we leave you
in a rich neighborhood;

300
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,451
you'll have a
better shot at life.

301
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,286
Max, you are okay with this?

302
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,854
Well, I was more okay

303
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:51,323
when I did this with
my cousin's baby.

304
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,662
There you go.

305
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,767
Oh, yeah.
Move him to the next house.

306
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,469
South-facing sun.
Pre-war building.

307
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,703
She'll love it.

308
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:08,040
There you go.

309
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,608
You live in Park Slope now.

310
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,110
You can adopt an African baby

311
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:14,046
and wheel it around
in a $900 stroller.

312
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:17,750
Can you believe
that was my plan "B"?

313
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,718
Run!
Run away.

314
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,987
Go.

315
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,156
Ah, screw it.
She lives here now.

316
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,395
Ooh. Look.

317
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,663
They have a piano.

318
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:32,464
You can make videos.

319
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:36,068
You'll be a YouTube star.

320
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,137
Bye, Kitty.

321
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,608
Wow, I'm shocked
you didn't stop me.

322
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:43,909
Stop you?

323
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,277
If I had known that was option,

324
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,812
I would have had you
stuff me in there.

325
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:52,518
I wonder what Kitty's doing

326
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,119
<i>in her fancy</i>
<i>town house right now.</i>

327
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,455
She's probably snuggling
with an older gay guy

328
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,589
who likes to read.

329
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,924
You know, 'cause gay guys

330
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,626
are the only ones
who still read.

331
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:02,194
They're probably
on the couch right now

332
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,297
with <i>A Tale of Two Kitties.</i>

333
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:06,932
I'm proud of us.

334
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,600
We selflessly gave
that cat a better life

335
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,269
than we could ever
afford for ourselves.

336
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,037
Oh, don't try to get in
on that.

337
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:13,272
I did the right thing.

338
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:14,673
You tried to leave her

339
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,643
at that crazy lady's
pussy riot.

340
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,478
Hi. Excuse me.

341
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,280
Would it be okay if I put this
flier next to your window?

342
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,382
No.
Sure.

343
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:25,184
We lost our cat, Jinxy,
like, a week ago

344
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:26,452
in this neighborhood.

345
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,554
Have you seen her?

346
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,988
No. No.

347
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,323
I haven't seen a cat
in a long time.

348
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,858
I was just saying
to her yesterday,

349
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,627
"I haven't seen a cat
in a long time."

350
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,797
Um, how come you didn't
have a collar on her?

351
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,165
And where's her I.D. tag?

352
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,301
Even my mother had
an I.D. tag on me.

353
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:45,304
Well, it was
a flea collar, but...

354
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:47,873
Why did it take you so long
to put the signs up?

355
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,909
Um, what's happening?

356
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,177
Um, here's what's happening:

357
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,412
We are more than happy

358
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:54,913
to put up this
flier of your cat,

359
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:56,381
which we have never, ever seen.

360
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:58,884
I mean, seriously, where
did all the cats go?

361
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,586
Queens?
Staten Island?

362
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,988
'Cause they're not
in this neighborhood.

363
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,590
Okay.

364
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:08,093
This was weird.

365
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,729
Is there any way
this cat isn't Kitty?

366
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,030
Nope, that's her.

367
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,166
Same green eyes,
same notch in the ear.

368
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,602
Hello.
Hello.

369
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,338
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

370
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,240
Hey, girls.
What's shaking?

371
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:25,344
Not me, 'cause I'm all held in.

372
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:26,712
Sorry, Sophie,
the cupcake window

373
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,113
isn't open during the day.

374
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,548
I don't need your life story.

375
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:32,618
I just need a damn cupcake.

376
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,052
Sophie, do you
remember that cat

377
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,687
that was crying outside
our building?

378
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,090
Yeah, you put it down?

379
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,391
We thought it was a stray,

380
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,626
so we tried to find
a home for it,

381
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,927
but couldn't.

382
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,862
So you put it down.

383
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,264
No.

384
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,299
We left it in a really
nice neighborhood.

385
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,369
Oh, so a rich person
put it down?

386
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,571
It turns out it
wasn't a stray at all.

387
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:53,872
We just met its owner.

388
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:56,141
This is the cat, Sophie.

389
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,643
Her name's Jinxy.

390
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,478
Oh, wait a minute.

391
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:02,314
Wait a minute.

392
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:03,982
You remember how I told you

393
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,584
that if you die outside
in Poland,

394
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,386
you come back as a cat?

395
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,388
Yeah, that's kind of
hard to forget.

396
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,292
That's not Jinxy.
That's my friend Nancy.

397
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,062
Look at her.

398
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:18,630
Same green eyes,

399
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,065
same notch in the ear.

400
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,234
Same whiskers.

401
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,769
I don't think that
this is Nancy.

402
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,970
Oh, yes.

403
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:27,105
She and I got in a big fight

404
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,675
and how she's come back
to haunt me.

405
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,811
She died waiting for
an apology from me,

406
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,646
and now she's back.

407
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,648
Guess what.

408
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,651
She's not gonna get it.

409
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,339
Jinxy!
Jinxy!

410
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,460
Jinxy, come on, girl.

411
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,028
Look, I said on the phone,

412
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,897
this area is where we
randomly spotted her.

413
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:02,633
I wonder how Jinxy got
all the way to Park Slope.

414
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,335
Just wait.
She's here, I promise.

415
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,737
Jinxy!

416
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,572
Jinxy!

417
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:09,307
Nancy.

418
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,477
Nancy!
Nancy!

419
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:14,078
Nancy!
Nancy!

420
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,514
Come on, Nancy!

421
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:19,016
Nancy, it's Sophie!

422
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:22,653
I'm here to apologize!

423
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:25,056
Um, what's happening?

424
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:28,159
Oh, my God.
It's Nancy.

425
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,327
<i>I mean, Jinxy.</i>

426
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,529
I mean, Kitty.

427
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,331
Ooh...

428
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:35,767
Hello.
Hello.

429
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:38,002
Hi, baby.

430
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:40,505
Kitty, kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

431
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:41,739
What she's doing, they like it.

432
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,574
I know, because I liked it.

433
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,243
Anyway, we found your cat.

434
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,744
Isn't that great?

435
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:49,080
Actually, she's
my boyfriend's cat.

436
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,615
I'm keeping her.

437
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:52,517
Max, just close your
eyes and look away,

438
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:54,118
like you do whenever
those people ask you

439
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,087
if you have a minute
to save the earth.

440
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,725
Just stick it in here.

441
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,427
"Just stick it in here"?

442
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:04,796
That's what I say when
my hand gets tired.

443
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,178
Maxy. Maxy.

444
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,181
Maxy, Maxy, Maxy.

445
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:40,164
Now do me.

446
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,300
First of all,

447
00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:46,070
I own the diner now.

448
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:50,141
Secondly, don't ever
do that again.

449
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:54,445
I guess I'll just
have to spank myself.

450
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,881
No surprise there.

451
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,485
I hope you're happy.

452
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:02,320
I found Jinxy's owners
on Facebook.

453
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:03,621
Not one pic of Kitty,

454
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:04,789
not even a status update

455
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,957
saying,
"We found our cat."

456
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,325
But she is more than willing

457
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,993
to talk about her
reverse French manicure

458
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:10,595
and posts pictures of a meal

459
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,864
I know she's gonna make
herself throw up later.

460
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,432
Come on, Max.

461
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,634
There's got to be
one photo of Kitty.

462
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:17,702
Oh, wow.

463
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:18,970
You found one?

464
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:21,005
No, that manicure is heaven.

465
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,640
Max, photos or not,

466
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,208
we need to focus on the fact

467
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:26,210
that the cat is back with
the guy who loves her.

468
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:27,278
The guy who loves her?

469
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,980
He doesn't love Kitty.

470
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:30,448
If he did, why aren't
there any pictures of her

471
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:31,883
at his first wedding?

472
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:34,352
What, he couldn't spring
for a cat tuxedo?

473
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:36,521
They're, like, 20 bucks.

474
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:39,357
I know because I have one
on my garden gnome.

475
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,158
This is not a loving home.

476
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,493
Pics, or it didn't happen.

477
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:44,128
Okay, Max.
Okay, just say it.

478
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,696
I put the cat
in an abusive home.

479
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:47,532
You put the cat
in an abusive home.

480
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:55,139
I have a gift for you.

481
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:59,210
No way!
No way!

482
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,178
Oh, yeah, it's Jinxy.

483
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,814
It's Nancy.
Jinxy was her slave name.

484
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,419
Oh, Nancy, I missed you.

485
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,521
I missed you so much.

486
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:12,924
What did you do?
How did you get her?

487
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:14,659
Well, it was
really complicated.

488
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,193
I went to their apartment,
and I said,

489
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:17,695
"You don't love that cat,"

490
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,931
and they said,
"You're right. Take it."

491
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,100
Oh, my God!

492
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,437
Is this what happiness
feels like?

493
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:28,673
So what made you
change your mind?

494
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:31,375
Because two years ago
I was outside your door,

495
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:35,846
saying,
"Hello. Hello."

496
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,449
And you let me in,
and it changed my life.

497
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,917
That's kind of different,
though,

498
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:41,385
because I didn't want
to let you in,

499
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:44,388
and I did want to let
the cat in.

500
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,023
But you did let me in.

501
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:47,625
You let me in,
and you gave me food

502
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,226
and shelter and love.

503
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:52,196
Not the way I wanted
to give to the cat.

504
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:54,198
Max, are you trying
to equate a person's love

505
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,199
with a cat's love?

506
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Not really.

507
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,102
A cat's love is eternal.

508
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,870
Hey, girls.

509
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,206
I'm heading over to
the bodega salad bar.

510
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:04,241
They just added hot ribs
and a sneeze guard.

511
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:06,577
You need anything?

512
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:08,479
Sophie, we got the cat back.

513
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,948
She was in a house
where she wasn't wanted.

514
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,216
Oh, yeah.

515
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:14,986
That is so Nancy.

516
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:19,223
Sophie, do you want
to see the cat?

517
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:22,193
She's in the apartment?

518
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,431
No, no, no.

519
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,599
No, no.

520
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,267
I can't see her right now!

521
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,403
It's too much!

522
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:34,772
I'm happy for you, Nancy!

523
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:36,741
But I can't do this right now!

524
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,484
Wait, where did the cat go?

525
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,252
Oh, no, Chestnut.

526
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:49,754
<i>I left the back door open.</i>

527
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,926
Oh, my God.
Look.

528
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,795
She's on top of Chestnut.

529
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,664
They like each other.

530
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:00,665
Why wouldn't they?

531
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,699
She's a foxy redhead,

532
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,035
and he's a stud.

533
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,703
You did the right thing.

534
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,039
Kitty, kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

535
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,274
Why do I like that so much?

536
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:12,777
'Cause something with boobs
is touching you?

537
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:18,267
