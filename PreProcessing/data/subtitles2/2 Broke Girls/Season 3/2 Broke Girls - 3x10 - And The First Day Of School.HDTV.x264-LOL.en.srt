1
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:04,346
Okay, Max, I figured out
our new schedule.

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:07,994
And I figured out the cheap toothpaste
we've been using is really diaper cream.

3
00:00:08,857 --> 00:00:11,658
On the plus side,
that rash cleared up on my gums.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,180
We'll do our diner shift
from 6:00 till 2:00,

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,064
then sell cupcakes here
from 2:00 to 4:00,

6
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,150
make the cupcakes in the morning
from 7:00 to 11:00,

7
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,783
and then pastry school
from 12:00 to 4:00.

8
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,318
- Forget anything?
- Just poopin' and sleepin'.

9
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:25,167
Now, I have to go
rewrite the schedule.

10
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:28,003
Let's go, Max, you have a huge,
huge day tomorrow.

11
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,256
- First day of pastry school.
- Stop saying it's huge.

12
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:35,043
Whenever I think something's gonna be
huge, it just turns out to be all balls.

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,833

15
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:54,311
I splurged
and had my blouse cleaned.

16
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:56,997
Dry cleaning bags remind me
of when I had money.

17
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:01,418
Really? They remind me of when
my mother tried to suffocate me.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,687
Allegedly.
Let's go.

19
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,222
Wait, wait.
Max, you can't go yet.

20
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:07,107
I need you to stay
and help with something.

21
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,612
Han, I told you... it's bend and wipe,
then up come your big boy pants.

22
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:15,449
Yeah, Han’s right. You can't go.
Stay here a few more minutes.

23
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:19,737
Why? Oh. Are we having
an intervention for Max?

24
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,538
Hey, everybody.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,660
Oh, I hope I'm not late for Max's
first day of school surprise party.

26
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,912
Sophie, we hadn't
surprised her yet.

27
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:33,638
Oh, but she's right there.
You just blew it, Han.

28
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,553
Aw, a surprise party.

29
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,806
- Isn't this sweet, Max?
- I don't trust it.

30
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:43,354
Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me,
his penis was on a hot dog bun.

31
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,064
One meat lover's pizza.

32
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:50,601
And one meat lover.

33
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,653
Max, come on.
Get it while it's hot.

34
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,938
You're opening that box.

35
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,526
Hm, who's got a ten to tip
the cute pizza delivery guy?

36
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,912
Sophie, this is Luis,
the day waiter.

37
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:06,784
Oh, you're Sophie,
Oleg’s ex.

38
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:09,403
Sister, I know
all about you.

39
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:13,874
Oh, do you?
Do you know all about me?

40
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:16,543
I'm his good friend.

41
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:18,912
You know, I'm having trouble
hearing your accent.

42
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:22,933
Did you say "good friend"
or "girlfriend?"

43
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,436
Please, <i>mami.</i>
I wish.

44
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,137
I like the entertainment.

45
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:30,090
It's better than the magician at my
friend Stephanie's 16th birthday

46
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:33,159
that made
her virginity disappear.

47
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,696
Max, we're all so proud
of you.

48
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:38,115
Tomorrow is the first day
of the rest of your life.

49
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:41,485
Aw, crap.
I gotta do this again?

50
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:44,455
All right, but this time, I'm not
seeing <i>Trouble with the Curve.</i>

51
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:48,792
- You are about to do something very big.
- Yes, she is. Such a big step.

52
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,444
Big step
for both of us,

53
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:52,112
'cause I'll be using
my business acumen

54
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:54,047
working in the office
to help pay the tuition.

55
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,167
Shh.
I'm talking about Max.

56
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:00,137
So we all chipped in to get you
something for your first day of school.

57
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,455
It's my first day too.

58
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:05,225
Caroline, please, I can't hear Han
talking about Max, okay?

59
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:10,314
Here you go, darling,
a book bag for school.

60
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,467
So what, then? Is my surprise
party after this one?

61
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,436
What is happening?

62
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:18,105
People doing nice things
for me and smiling?

63
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:22,025
Am I transferring
foster homes again?

64
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,744
And there's
more stuff inside.

65
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,613
That was supposed to be
a surprise too.

66
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,462
Oh.
Surprise!

67
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,319
Max, open it.
Look inside.

68
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,955
Yeah, Max, see what's inside
for your big day.

69
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:38,258
Big day for Max.
Big day for me as well.

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,262
- A metrocard? No way.
- From me. Unlimited rides.

71
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:47,016
Oh. Unlimited rides? Is that
what your tramp stamp says?

72
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,109
I was gonna get mad,
but that was a damn good one.

73
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,016
What's this?
Han's house?

74
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,151
A simple "thank you"
would suffice.

75
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,403
Thank you for
your house, Han.

76
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,456
It's a pencil case,
and I love it.

77
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,659
And I was sitting here, thinking how you
were all ignoring my part of the big day.

78
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:17,631
And then, you give me this pencil case
to use in the office and prove me wrong.

79
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,116
That's for Max.

80
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:22,669
What the hell
is wrong with you people?

81
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:26,173
Max doesn't even need pencils.
She'll be baking.

82
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,810
Well, she'll be baked.
Take a look.

83
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:33,146
Joints.

84
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:37,341
Earl, that's so sweet.
These should last me till recess.

85
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,815
Wait, where's the chef's coat
Sophie had monogrammed?

86
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:43,767
Han, that was supposed to be
a surprise.

87
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:46,270
Oh, I know.
Karma's a bitch.

88
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,788
Oh, well.

89
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,874
Look.

90
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:52,209
My name's on this.

91
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:57,748
The only thing my name's ever
been on before is a urine sample.

92
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,216
Thank you, everyone.

93
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:03,053
So there is nothing
in that bag for me?

94
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:09,093
Nothing? Wow. I'd even take Oleg’s
penis in a hot dog bun right now.

95
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:14,018
I'll be right back.

96
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:21,301
- Getting on.
- Please move.

97
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:22,306
- On!
- Move!

98
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:25,492
- On! On!
- Move! Move!

99
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:29,947
I love the subway. It's the perfect
place to get out aggression.

100
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:32,199
I just punched someone
in the kidney.

101
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,952
- It was me.
- I know.

102
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:39,990
Oh, oh, bad smell, like someone
hooked up with a falafel.

103
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:41,876
- It was me.
- I know.

104
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,688
- Max.
- Sorry.

105
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:46,931
Subways, planes, and mosh pits,
I let it ride.

106
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,205
I love the smell
of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse.

107
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:52,793
I am so excited to be
out of that waitress uniform,

108
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:54,645
and back in my chic
business clothes,

109
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,463
and, you know,
going to my office,

110
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:59,766
where I'll probably save the day
using some of my Wharton magic.

111
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:03,403
You know, I think I like
you better without hope.

112
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,656
Max, you know this school
is expensive, right?

113
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,075
You're going in
with a good attitude, right?

114
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,744
No, that's what Earl's pencils
are for.

115
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:14,031
Don't worry, I'll do my best. I
mean, look, I have a book bag.

116
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,782
The only thing my mother
ever sent me to school with

117
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:18,285
was a note that said
"Check me for lice."

118
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:21,254
It was so sweet of everyone
to give you that,

119
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,324
even though I didn't sleep
all night about it.

120
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:27,094
And it looks kind of expensive.
Check for a designer label.

121
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,847
- Why? It's the thought that counts.
- Since when?

122
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,099
Let me see it.

123
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,302
<i>Second Avenue station.
This is second Avenue.</i>

124
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:38,472
No, no, no, Max!
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good.

125
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:40,006
Don't let go.

126
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,108
What if the train
starts to leave

127
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,310
and my arms pop off?

128
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:44,111
How will I go
to pastry school?

129
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:47,347
I'll be one of those people decorating
cookies with a bag in their mouth.

130
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,866
You are the devil.
The devil.

131
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,635
You have nothing.

132
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:55,539
Pull, Max, pull!
Pull it from the devil!

133
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,458
Can't.
The devil works out.

134
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,196
My bag.

135
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:04,748
My blouse.

136
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,051
My weed.

137
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh, great, look. Class has started.
My new life already blows.

138
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,537
Oh, look. There's chef Gorgeous.
I don't want him to see me like this.

139
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm gonna go to the restroom and see if
cold water can get out any of the stain.

140
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,524
Go, Max.

141
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,870
But I don't have my
chef coat or book bag.

142
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:33,889
I know I only had them for a couple of
hours, but it was the best part of me.

143
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,474
You'll do great.

144
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,921
First, do me a favor.
Check me for lice.

145
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,264
This course is designed
to introduce you

146
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:45,968
to the skills and techniques required
in the production of yeast bread,

147
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,239
short pastry doughs, custards,
<i>pate a choux</i>, and cake batters.

148
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,824
Chef Max, you are late.

149
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:55,744
Wait, are sure class
doesn't start at 10:17?

150
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,174
Sorry, I got robbed
on the subway by some jerk.

151
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:02,077
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm right here.

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,224
I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna
strip my way through pastry school.

153
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,409
That's an option?

154
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,760
All right, chefs.
Let's focus.

155
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:15,731
Did he say he wants
to "foke us"?

156
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,038
___

157
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,524
Morning, Bebe.

158
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:28,110
Hi. Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

159
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:29,812
And I should tell you
my doctor says

160
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:33,115
I'm not allowed to hear bad news
for another month.

161
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:34,817
I apologize
for my appearance.

162
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:38,120
We got robbed on the subway, and
then someone hit me with hot coffee.

163
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,788
Then, I went to wash cold water
on the stain

164
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,200
and somehow wound up entering
myself in a wet T-shirt contest.

165
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,796
Um, that's a lot of energy
for me,

166
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:52,089
so I'm just gonna need to sit
here for a second and be quiet.

167
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:57,256
I know we're being quiet, which
I'm all about, but cute dogs.

168
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:59,925
Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels.
I rescue them.

169
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,007
You know, people rescue
greyhounds and pit bulls,

170
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,379
but everyone ignores
the cocker spaniel.

171
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,224
They're like, "Ew, eye goo.
Shoot it."

172
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,446
I have three cockers.

173
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,281
Do you have any pets?

174
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,516
I have a horse, Chestnut.
He's a thoroughbred.

175
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,660
Well, what can I do first?

176
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,966
What's this?
Why am I holding a juice menu?

177
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,423
Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice
for the students and the staff.

178
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:35,423
What a treat. Fresh juice is such a scam
unless someone else is payin'.

179
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:37,741
I'll take
the Greens number three.

180
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,843
Uh-huh, well, put it on the list
when you get the other ones.

181
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,962
Wait, I'm supposed
to get the juice?

182
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,937
Oh, boy, it's like
I'm a bad news machine.

183
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,301
Oh. Okay.

184
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:52,688
Happy to do it.
Surprised, but happy.

185
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,442
Uh, maybe I could change into
one of those cute chef jackets.

186
00:09:56,444 --> 00:10:00,796
Oh, chef Nicholas only permits
pastry chefs to wear these.

187
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:03,499
But I can't meet everyone
on my first day looking like this.

188
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:06,702
I mean, it's already bad enough
I'm the juice girl.

189
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:08,621
I have some workout clothes
you can wear.

190
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,590
Don't worry.
I haven't worn them yet.

191
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,873
But I will someday.

192
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,632
Hi.
Hi, everyone.

193
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:21,166
I'm here to take
the fresh juice orders

194
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,519
and also to say this is not
what I came to work in.

195
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,523
What I came to work in
had less eyes.

196
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,108
Caroline, welcome.

197
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,560
How is it going
in the office so far?

198
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:34,564
So great, and so not what
I came to work in.

199
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:37,567
I'm usually wearing Chanel,
not <i>le chien.</i>

200
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,318
That's "dog" in French.

201
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,872
Oh, 'cause it's "dork"
in English.

202
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:46,826
Well, it is lovely to see
both of your faces.

203
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:49,078
Class, we start
with the basics.

204
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,296
No, no, no,
you in the back...

205
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:54,500
Juice, miss? Care for a juice from
someone who scored 1560 on her SATs?

206
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:58,638
You can score more
than 500?

207
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,423
Why the hell
are you wearing that?

208
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,227
I didn't think your chest
could get any sadder.

209
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,228
It's Bebe's.

210
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,813
Max, taking juice orders is
not what I came here to do.

211
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:11,000
I hear you.
I'll have the Ruby red.

212
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,519
I always keep the edge clean,
so when I'm squeezing it,

213
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,542
it's not gonna have cream
popping all over the place.

214
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:20,910
Words to live by.

215
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,696
I have
the opposite problem.

216
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:26,860
Yo, my cream's poppin'
right now.

217
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,703
What are you doing? You told me
you were gonna take school seriously.

218
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:33,956
It's not me. That guy's a bad influence.
Look at him.

219
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,100
He looks like someone who
sells drugs on Sesame Street.

220
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:40,546
You're gonna get
in trouble,

221
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:43,432
and I am not wearing a cocker spaniel
so you can get kicked out of class.

222
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,329
Right. I hear you.
Now, where's my juice?

223
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,889
Hey, chef Max.
Check out my technique.

224
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:54,927
Awesome gross sound bonus.

225
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:59,115
Chef, if you find this
so funny,

226
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:01,317
why don't you take
a fiver?

227
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,035
Isn't this how
your saying goes?

228
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,403
I don't have a saying,

229
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:06,122
but if I did,
it'd be more like

230
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,373
"Eatin' ain't cheatin'."

231
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:14,797
Anyone else
who finds something hilarious

232
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,583
can also go
into the hall.

233
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:20,886
- Chef Max?
- Nope, nothing 'ilarious. Teach on.

234
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,955
Enough with
the dirty jokes.

235
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,761
We are all here
to become master bakers.

236
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:31,430
Master-baking is something
I work really hard at it.

237
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:33,985
- To be a master baker...
- I'll be in the hall.

238
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,659
- Hi, I'm Deke.
- Did you say "freak?"

239
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:45,411
- Deke.
- Did you say "geek?"

240
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:48,798
Deke, as in
"Big Deke."

241
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:54,116
Mine's bigger.

242
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:59,342
We should be lab partners.
Come on. It'll be bitchin'.

243
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,493
Max and Deke,
making cakes.

244
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:05,120
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday,
with a special performance by Creed.

245
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,883
Okay, now stop,
stop, stop.

246
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,970
I am trying to be a good student,
so you just stay away from me.

247
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,805
You are
a bad influence.

248
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:14,390
And I know I nailed that speech
'cause kids at school

249
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:16,142
used to say it to me
all the time.

250
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:20,229
- Time to change your tampon?
- Yep.

251
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,885
Day two.
Serious flow.

252
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:27,620
Killer Fanny pack.
Where's your tribal poncho?

253
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:29,213
Ah, keep my needles
in this.

254
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:33,159
You're a drug addict too?
God. You are irresistible.

255
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,996
It's... it's insulin.
I'm a diabetic.

256
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:39,415
A diabetic pastry chef.

257
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,968
Wow, you're even more
self-destructive than me.

258
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,637
So diabetes,
how is that?

259
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,030
Disappointing.
I put in for syphilis.

260
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,897
Stop laughing. I have to carry
27 juices 2 blocks wearing this.

261
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,517
Why'd you let the dog lady
talk to you like that?

262
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,548
She's my friend,
even in that shirt.

263
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,311
Well, there goes
another $12.

264
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:13,532
I have spent more money dry cleaning
this blouse than I have on health care.

265
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:17,953
Health care? You mean that box of
band-aids we got at the 99 cent store?

266
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:21,740
I just have to look good tomorrow.
Today was mortifying.

267
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:24,743
They called me "Sad dog"
at the juice place.

268
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,349
"Sad dog,
your juices are ready."

269
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,005
Sad dog, pick up.

270
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:36,305
Can you take these to table ten?
I'm backed up on the booths.

271
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:39,809
Can you? I'm kind of just
sitting here a minute,

272
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,694
enjoying not being told
what to do.

273
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:44,113
I get enough of it
at that school.

274
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,815
Look.

275
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:48,234
If you're gonna do the martyr
thing, do it right.

276
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,568
Stick your hand
in boiling oil

277
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,873
or even more painful, binge-watch
<i>Shahs of Sunset</i> on Bravo.

278
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,651
I need to talk to you
in the kitchen now.

279
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,945
Leave, someone's about to get
schooled about school.

280
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:03,115
This looks like it's going
to get dirty and ugly.

281
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:05,751
May I film it?

282
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:09,498
And if so, may I then
sell it on the Internet?

283
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,700
- Look. You can't just do this for me.
- You're right. So we're out?

284
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,096
No, we're not out, you said
you were gonna do this for me.

285
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:21,096
I know, but you just said I can't
just do it for you, and I agree.

286
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:23,903
- I mean, who was I kidding?
- Me. You were kidding me.

287
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,988
I went in there thinking
I was gonna use

288
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,440
my business skills,
and whatever hope

289
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,192
I had of a flirtation
with Frenchie McFrench

290
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:32,811
went out the window when he saw me
wearing that t-shirt that said,

291
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,314
"Don't forget
to spay and neuter me."

292
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:37,022
Fine, I can quit.
It's fine.

293
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:40,152
- It is? Really?
- No, it's not fine.

294
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:43,655
- Who am I kidding?
- Me. You were kidding me.

295
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:45,979
Well, you've gotta figure out
something there to keep you interested,

296
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,676
because you can't go to
pastry school just for me,

297
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:50,596
and I'm not gonna not go
to pastry school for you.

298
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,971
Okay. You're right, Max.
Of course I'll do it for you.

299
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:55,334
I just had a bad day.
I mean, we both did.

300
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:57,784
You lost your man's briefcase
and your drugs,

301
00:15:57,785 --> 00:16:02,091
and I lost my dignity
and a possible love interest.

302
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,860
Surprise!

303
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,313
See, that's how
it's supposed to go.

304
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:10,950
- We got you a new book bag.
- Yeah, and a new chef's jacket.

305
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,852
And a switchblade.

306
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:18,541
Yeah, 'cause we're not buyin'
another chef's jacket.

307
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,042
Max, you know
what this means?

308
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,861
That I got two surprises,
and you got nothing?

309
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:26,048
No, that everything's gonna
work out at that school.

310
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,383
I mean, in the blink
of an eye,

311
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:30,369
just like this, things can change
from bad to good.

312
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:32,805
Well, not totally good. They still
haven't gotten me anything.

313
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,474
Caroline, you didn't
not get anything.

314
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:38,594
Here, your very own
pencil case.

315
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:45,568
But no pencils.
My pencil dealer got busted.

316
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,070
Aw.
Thank you, guys.

317
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:51,073
I'm touched.
I was not expecting it.

318
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:56,028
Really? 'Cause you kinda
bullied us all into it.

319
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,869
So that's a 780 on verbal,
and a 780 on math.

320
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:08,226
And with my degree
in finance,

321
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:12,001
jackass-ing around the city getting juice
could be seen as a waste of my talents.

322
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,464
And as the valedictorian
at my graduation said...

323
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:18,884
and I'm stealin'
from myself here,

324
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:24,172
"I've seen the future of finance,
and it's us."

325
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:28,038
- So you want me to get the juices?
- Just for today. Please?

326
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:36,735
Meringue cookies are a simple way
to practice our pastry bag technique.

327
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:39,884
Hm, interesting technique
you got going there, chef.

328
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,320
Dude, we gotta ditch
these deadbeat partners.

329
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:43,854
I'm stuck over there
with grandma.

330
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,223
No, I'm staying
with the big guy next to me.

331
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,993
He's not gonna get me in trouble.
He never talks. Get outta here.

332
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:53,614
- Go back to your own table, Fat Albert.
- Okay. I'm going back.

333
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,754
And the <i>Fat Albert</i> thing was
'cause I'm black, not fat, right?

334
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,870
'Cause I go to the gym
two, three times a year.

335
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,206
I hear talking,
but no baking up front.

336
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,068
No, no, no, you only hear baking.
Just furiously master-baking up here.

337
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,913
The meringue needs
to have nice peaks.

338
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:12,883
You are looking to make
moist, pointy peaks.

339
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,334
I like to pinch them.

340
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,538
Chef, seriously, man-to-man,
we got a problem.

341
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:24,211
I don't think Max should be stuck
with that big guy. He's not cool.

342
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:28,282
I was just over there, and the only
pointy peaks he's interested in are hers.

343
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:30,401
Talkin' boobies here, chef.

344
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:35,122
Chef John, chef Deke here seems to think
you are sexually harassing Max.

345
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,577
Oh, please.

346
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:41,005
If I was harassing anyone,
it would be you, chef.

347
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,991
I mean, come on.

348
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:50,242
- Be right back, Big Mary.
- You know it.

349
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:56,568
- Where's my juice? It's been an hour.
- The mood swing elf's getting them.

350
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,557
Look, I'm coming in there to flirt
with chef Nicholas, and when I enter,

351
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,659
I need you to say,
"Caroline, you look amazing."

352
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,921
No.

353
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,316
I actually physically
can't say that.

354
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:09,901
I would rather walk in there
and yell,

355
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:13,037
"I have crabs,
and three of them just escaped."

356
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,680
Call 9-1-1.
Call 9-1-1.

357
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:18,293
Something's happened
to the adorable mixed-race one.

358
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,545
Deke?

359
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:22,580
He's diabetic.
He needs Insulin.

360
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:24,382
Has anyone here ever
administered a needle?

361
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:27,502
Uh, administer means the same
thing as "shove it in," right?

362
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,470
Good, good, good, Max.
Come, come, come.

363
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,872
Okay, uh, his syringes
are in his fanny pack.

364
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:34,842
I've actually never done this without
<i>Iron Maiden</i> playing in the background,

365
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:36,227
but I'll give it
a shot.

366
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:39,547
Just put it anywhere
in my hot bod.

367
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,432
God help us.

368
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,961
- Oh, I hate needles. I can't look.
- Oh.

369
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:51,576
Get it together, ladies.

370
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:54,403
This is why I'm not allowed
to hold babies.

371
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:59,250
Max, I think you and Deke should be
lab partners from now on,

372
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,753
in case something like this
happens again.

373
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:04,539
- Is that okay?
- I guess if I have to.

374
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,073
Max?

375
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,259
I guess if I have to.

376
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:09,910
<i>Oh, mon Dieu!</i>

377
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:13,021
What, did you not take
your Insulin on purpose?

378
00:20:13,022 --> 00:20:15,900
I really wanted
to be your partner.

379
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,555
Bebe, I can't find a chef jacket
anywhere in here.

380
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,440
And I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to wear one,

381
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:25,860
but I'm really cold, and I can't
walk around like this all day.

382
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,528
Maybe I can help.

383
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,897
You can't stand there
wet and cold.

384
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,949
Take my jacket.
Oh, no, no, no.

385
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:34,333
You don't have...
oh, that'll work.

386
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:38,406
I'm sorry about the no shirt under, but
I just get so hot when I'm teaching.

387
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:40,991
Yeah, hot.
So hot.

388
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,462
<i>Oh mon Dieu.</i>

389
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:47,131
I was just giving it
to Caroline.

390
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:50,918
I mean, she needs something to wear,
and... and now, she has it.

391
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,888
Chef, I will
see you later.

392
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,600
Caroline...

393
00:20:56,643 --> 00:21:00,025
Max, I think I found something
to keep me interested.

394
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:03,097
This is weird.
So I'm the good student now?

395
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:06,150
And you're the one
sleeping with the teacher?

396
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:09,970
We're not sleeping together.
Why? Do you think he wants to?

397
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:13,516
I don't know, but you better hurry it up
before Big Mary gets him.

398
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:18,134
