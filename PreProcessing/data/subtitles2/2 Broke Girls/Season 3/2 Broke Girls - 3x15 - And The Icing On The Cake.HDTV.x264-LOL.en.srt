1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:08,655
Max, your boyfriend is naked and waving
from the dumpster he calls his apartment.

2
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:11,563
Make sure it's Deke.
Last time you said that, I went over,

3
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:14,326
and it was just a naked meth head
in a normal dumpster.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,201
I mean, we had a blast,
but still.

5
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,148
Well, at least that meth head
bought a bunch of cupcakes.

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:23,250
I mean, he thought they were alive,
but he bought them.

7
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:27,205
- Hey, I'm gonna cut out early.
- You're sleeping over again?

8
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:31,722
Seriously, Max, sleeping in a dumpster?
Are you trying to bring SARS back?

9
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,179
Well, I did bring it in
the first time,

10
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,823
and that is the last time
I hook up with a bat in Thailand.

11
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,149
Hey, Max.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,859
Season 3, Episode 15
"And The Icing On The Cake"

13
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:55,353
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,947
Max is 45 minutes late.

15
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,166
And she better not say
she have a prostate exam

16
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:06,208
'cause I'm not falling
for that again.

17
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:09,633
Relax, she's just down
the street at Deke's place.

18
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,181
You know how it is when you first
start sleeping with somebody,

19
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:13,944
and you can't keep
your hands off each other...

20
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:16,018
Yeah, just take
my word for it.

21
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:20,009
I know I couldn't keep my hands
off my first love.

22
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,346
I'm talking, of course,
about my penis.

23
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:27,934
I've had enough!
You two girls walk all over me.

24
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:30,103
A baby can walk
all over you.

25
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,046
Hi, everybody.

26
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:39,838
Oh, I just heard two hobos
getting freaky in the garbage.

27
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:43,032
Sophie,
that was Max and Deke.

28
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,418
Oh, I get it.

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,494
You gotta do crazy things
to keep it fresh.

30
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:53,279
You know, I once had sex
on a bus, and I was driving it.

31
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,880
Boy, were those kids
late to school.

32
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,759
That's it, I am marching over there
and putting my foot down with Max.

33
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,017
No one has sex
on my clock.

34
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:09,732
Well, maybe your clock's
not big enough.

35
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,818
That's it.
No more free jell-o.

36
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:19,664
Max!

37
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,645
Max, open up.
I'm very upset.

38
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:26,759
More upset than that time
you enrolled me in Little League.

39
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,754
Hey, it was your decision
to play the full season.

40
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,841
Oh, goody, I was hoping for some
hecklers at this, my lowest moment.

41
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:39,704
Hey, if the dumpster's rockin',
don't bother knockin', baby.

42
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:41,898
Hey, man.

43
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,066
Hello, little girl.

44
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,519
I'll take three boxes
of Samoas and a thin mints.

45
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:49,104
Don't forget
my tagalongs.

46
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,939
They're called
<i>peanut butter patties</i> now.

47
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,125
Why must I be that person?

48
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:56,033
- What up, fools?
- Hey, girl.

49
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,365
Max, you're 48 minutes
late for work.

50
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,483
Look, little Debbie,

51
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,953
we're in here preparing for a big
pastry school competition tomorrow.

52
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,744
And having sex.

53
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,241
And if you ever interrupt me
while I am studying...

54
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,126
And having sex.

55
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:13,695
Again, I will dropkick
your baby-powdered ass

56
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:16,122
back to the Shire
with the other hobbits.

57
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:18,907
I told her.

58
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:22,293
Did you?

59
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:30,229
All flowers must be set on top
of the cakes by the time we call "time."

60
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:32,531
Everyone,
final touches.

61
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,306
That's what I used to say when
I finished my shift at Hooters.

62
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,385
Hot. You still got
that uniform?

63
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:40,749
Oh, not sure it'd fit me anymore.
I used to have really big boobs.

64
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:44,276
Bebe, how much time
is there left?

65
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:45,828
For all of us?

66
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,415
Oh, oh, gosh,
I'd say two months, tops.

67
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,583
No, no,
for the cake competition.

68
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:55,500
- Oh, 60 seconds.
- Only 60 seconds? Come on!

69
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,073
I'm sorry, I can't handle
this pressure.

70
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:01,790
It's only a matter of time before
I start eating my eyelashes again.

71
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,697
The winning team will earn
a free week of class.

72
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,734
And also... how do you say...
<i>Bragging rights.</i>

73
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:12,216
Hurry! Move
faster, Lindsay Slow-Hands.

74
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,471
Forget about it, Big Mary.
These competition is ours.

75
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:18,645
Deke and I are broke.
We need this more than you.

76
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,439
15 seconds!

77
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,782
Oh, <i>bonjour</i>, Caroline.
This is a real treat.

78
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:25,617
Mm-mm, uh-uh, don't do that.
You're married.

79
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:29,204
I'm only here in an official capacity.
Bebe's in an emotional ball in the hall.

80
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:31,740
- Ten seconds!
- Come on, girl.

81
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:34,493
Bring it home, bring it home,
bring it home, bring it home!

82
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:37,205
I am way too excited
about this.

83
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:39,966
Okay, everybody.
I see a clear favorite here.

84
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,884
But, Caroline,
in truth,

85
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:46,067
if I were to pick the prettiest
flower in the room, I'd pick you.

86
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,424
That is... Incredibly obvious

87
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:51,994
and incredibly accurate.

88
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:54,763
Oh, come on!
Get a stairwell!

89
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,983
- Your timer.
<i>- Merci.</i>

90
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,441
Just tell us who won.

91
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:10,162
The winners are,
I am very happy to say...

92
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,914
Max and Deke.

93
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,084
You were amazing!
I love you.

94
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:18,287
I love you too.

95
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,541
Wait, you do?

96
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,142
Do you...?

97
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:28,814
Yeah... I do.

98
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,800
Yeah, well, I do too,

99
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,970
so suck on that.

100
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,262
Okay, two important things.

101
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:50,166
One, I'm the guy you've been
talking to on <i>OK-Cupid</i>.

102
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:54,454
And two, I need five minutes
of girl talk

103
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:57,627
and not a minute more because
I'm worried it'll turn me into a girl.

104
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:01,277
Go. Tell me. Leave nothing out,
leave everything in.

105
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,631
I said something today
I never thought I'd say.

106
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,338
"Thank you"?

107
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,069
I said "I love you"
to Deke.

108
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,388
He said, "I love you,"
and I said it back.

109
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,681
Oh, cool.
Good for you.

110
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,589
Wait, that's it?

111
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:21,683
I finally decide to cave and be a girl
for you, and you hang me out to dry?

112
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:24,417
I've seen movies. You're supposed
to jump around and say,

113
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,842
"This calls
for a Margarita!"

114
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:29,689
This calls
for a Margarita!

115
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,641
Too much, too late.

116
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:35,451
Your first reaction said everything,
and your second one was just annoying.

117
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:39,182
I'm sorry, I just didn't think
you were taking him so seriously.

118
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:42,201
He has no money. I mean,
the man lives in a dumpster.

119
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:44,437
You are such a snob.

120
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,823
It doesn't bother you
he has to move his house

121
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,378
every Tuesday
between 10:00 and 2:00?

122
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,997
No, I've always wanted
to travel.

123
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:00,986
Come on, you can't really be
in love with him, right?

124
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,089
I mean,
you can't love Deke.

125
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:09,140
Max, you're in love with that cute
mochaccino homeless guy with the Jew-fro?

126
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:15,998
He is not homeless. He lives
in a beautifully decorated dumpster.

127
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,255
So homeless?

128
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,660
I get it.

129
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:25,097
You know, I used to be engaged
to a man who lived in the sewers.

130
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:28,640
Yeah, the heart wants
what it wants.

131
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,825
Plus he told me he was friends
with the Mutant Ninja Turtles,

132
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:35,883
and they were
a huge deal at the time.

133
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,702
At the time?

134
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:41,720
If he can introduce me
to Donatello, get him back.

135
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:45,481
How did you know
you loved this... Sewer man?

136
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:49,252
Well, he made me laugh.

137
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:51,637
He was very passionate,

138
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,034
and I wanted
to be with him constantly.

139
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,560
Probably because he got me
hooked on heroin.

140
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,479
That was a crazy summer.

141
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,517
See?
I feel the same way.

142
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,001
Minus the heroin part,
unfortunately.

143
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:13,376
Hey, can I use your bathroom? I have
to tinkle, and there's a wasp in mine.

144
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,781
Go ahead, Sophie.

145
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:20,281
What's that look?
Is the wasp behind me?

146
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,666
I can't believe you.

147
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,668
Even after three years
of being friends with me,

148
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,000
you still have a thing
against poor people.

149
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,807
Max, you love him, I can love him.

150
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,475
I just have to get
to know him better.

151
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,712
Invite me over to the garbage can
for a wine and cheese party.

152
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,261
Wait a minute.
Wine and cheese party?

153
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,813
Oh, I'm gonna bring
my new boy toy.

154
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:44,734
He's the Caesar salad pepperer
at the Olive Garden.

155
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:48,304
No dates, Sophie.

156
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:52,025
The place is so small, I once
accidentally took it home in my purse.

157
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,709
This camembert smells like feet,
so you know it's good.

158
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:05,955
Look at you, Mayor McCheese.
So fancy.

159
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,741
It's just the usual diner crew,
you know.

160
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:12,250
We serve
imitation imitation crab.

161
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,331
Well, I just wanted
to class the place up for you.

162
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,428
You know, get some wine,
get some cheese, flush.

163
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,889
You did not need to do that.
I love that you live here.

164
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,442
And if a dumpster was
good enough for me as a baby,

165
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:27,510
it is still good enough for me
as an adult.

166
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:32,449
Oh, you <i>love</i> that I live here.
Do you <i>love</i> anything else?

167
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:36,827
Well, I loved <i>The Karate Kid</i> movies
until Will Smith's kid ruined them.

168
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,240
Okay, can we please be serious
for a minute?

169
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,225
Did you just say "I love you"
because I said it first?

170
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:47,997
Look, honestly, yes.
But I definitely meant it, I think.

171
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,166
Look, I suck at this stuff.

172
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,719
This and not laughing
when kids fall.

173
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:58,892
Just know that if/when I say it again,
I <i>will</i> mean it.

174
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:01,628
I can totally wait...
I love you, Max.

175
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,062
Nice try, sneaky.

176
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,216
Oh, hi. Come on in.

177
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:10,103
And be nice.
Remember, you barely have a bed.

178
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:12,856
Don't worry.
I love this area.

179
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:15,111
I met your neighbor,
the mattress.

180
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,020
Oh, that queen?

181
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,897
So would you like a cabernet
or a Shiraz?

182
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,942
Shiraz.

183
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:25,520
Oh, that's a real name?

184
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,323
Some interesting pairings here.

185
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,018
In fact, I'm looking
at one as we speak.

186
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:35,534
Please, someone else
come right now.

187
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,525
Hi, everyone!
I'm here.

188
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,137
Please, someone else
come right now.

189
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:47,256
I brought some homemade
<i>kimchi bin dae duk</i>.

190
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:51,372
Would you like to try it, or should I
just throw it right into the garbage?

191
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:57,267
It took me a year to get this kind
of smell out of here, but thanks, Han.

192
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:00,336
Oh, what a dump.

193
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:04,440
I thought of that
on the way over.

194
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,493
All right, let's do this.

195
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:09,363
I'm ready to rage
all night, baby.

196
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:15,948
Oh, hell no.
I am too old for this.

197
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,955
Sophie, watch your head.
You might wanna take your heels off.

198
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:21,898
Take my heels off?

199
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,570
Communist Russia couldn't get me
to take my heels off.

200
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:30,800
Hey, Earl, you wanna go
get drunk somewhere

201
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:34,687
we don't have to bend over
till we want to?

202
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,889
Indeed, I do.

203
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,239
Not to brag, but I'm the only one
who can stand up in here.

204
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,168
Cool brag, Han.

205
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,590
- So, Deke, tell me about yourself.
- Hey, stop Guantanamo Bay-ing him.

206
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,745
Well, I go to pastry school,
I live in a dumpster,

207
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:59,963
and I was thrown out of <i>One Direction</i>
for being too handsome.

208
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,549
- That's about it.
- There must be more to you than that.

209
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,802
I mean, I'm surprised to see a Roquefort
cheese paired with a 2001 Syrah

210
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,170
from the Rhone region of France
at a dumpster party.

211
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,518
Where'd you learn
about wine?

212
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,462
Well, I wanted to impress you, and
I keep my adult grape juice game on point.

213
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:19,198
So where are you from originally? Did
you grow up in a storage facility or...

214
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,850
Will you stop?

215
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:23,486
He looks nervous like
the fat guy at a birthday party

216
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:25,204
when he finds out
there's a pool.

217
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,797
Coming, coming.

218
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:32,378
Good.
We have the right dumpster.

219
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,797
I brought some wine.
Bebe brought cheese.

220
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,215
Kind of.

221
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:38,968
Hey, guys, thanks for inviting me.
Happy to be included.

222
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,921
All right,
another babe.

223
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:45,677
Throw your keys in the bowl.
Right now, it's just me and Han, and...

224
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:47,891
That ain't happening.

225
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,764
What is Nicolas doing here?
Hide me.

226
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:54,474
I think you're gonna
run into him.

227
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:58,605
- Sorry, I thought you were into him.
- I'm not into him.

228
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:01,958
Please, Caroline, relax.
It's just a party. I'm here as a friend.

229
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:06,040
- Then where is your hand?
- On your beautiful bottom.

230
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,082
Sorry, it's crowded. It was
either there or in the sink.

231
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:12,340
- Please remove it.
- I-I did.

232
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,411
That one's mine, baby.

233
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:22,115
Come on, it's 8:45,
and nobody's got their tops off.

234
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:25,248
Somebody's gotta
do something.

235
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,636
Oh, one time I played
<i>Seven Minutes in Heaven</i>.

236
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:33,856
Well, I got hit by a bus, and
I was dead for seven minutes.

237
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,942
Bebe, do you want some wine?

238
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:40,315
Sure, why not? I don't have anything
to do tomorrow except move to Canada.

239
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,565
What?

240
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:45,956
Yeah, no biggie. Long story short,
they found me.

241
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:50,990
Caroline, looks like it's gonna be
just you and me in the office.

242
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:53,609
Nicolas, please. What did I
tell you about your hand?

243
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:55,576
That's me!

244
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:58,847
I was trying to push my way
to the cheese.

245
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:04,708
Hey, Bebe Gun, if you're ever in Alberta,
hit the Fairmont at Banff... super fun.

246
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,758
I got wasted and cannonballed
into the lake there once.

247
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,839
It was frozen.
Shattered my pelvis.

248
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,331
Good times.

249
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,815
Hey, I know that place.
Fairmont Chateau on Lake Louise?

250
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,851
We used to winter there.
That's a really exclusive resort.

251
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:22,188
I once saw them tell Barbra Streisand
to take it to the holiday inn.

252
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,473
Caroline, you want
some of my triple crème?

253
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,633
I don't want
any of your crème.

254
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,644
You know what, it's getting
a little crowded in here.

255
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,496
I'm just gonna slip out
without anyone noticing.

256
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:32,582
Oh, excuse me.

257
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,554
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me.

258
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,171
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

259
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,839
So...

260
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:42,108
Deke... what do you think?
Do you like him now?

261
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,994
Well, before tonight, I thought he was
the guy who walks around singing,

262
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:48,664
"When you're sliding into home and your
shorts are full of foam, diarrhea."

263
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,167
Now I find out he knows
all about cheese

264
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:55,588
and has been to this massively expensive
resort, so I'm even more confused.

265
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,275
What's confusing?
The foam is diarrhea.

266
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,810
Caroline, wait.

267
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,259
- Let me walk with you.
- No, no, no. I'm good.

268
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,277
Please, at least take my scarf.
It's cold.

269
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,125
No, I'm fine...

270
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,950
- Are you okay? Here, let me help.
- No, Nicolas.

271
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,915
I am not going
to be the other woman.

272
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,325
Despite the fact that I am literally
lying in trash, I am not trashy.

273
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,445
Caroline, listen.

274
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,103
Things aren't always
what they seem.

275
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,838
Just because that is garbage
on the outside

276
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,953
doesn't mean that it cannot be
a nice apartment on the inside.

277
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:36,167
Just because I'm married on the outside
doesn't mean I'm married on the inside.

278
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,643
Life is complex.

279
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,858
Your whole thesis is hinged
on the fact

280
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:43,693
that I think that dumpster
is nice on the inside,

281
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,965
which I don't.
Good night.

282
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:48,751
- Oh, Caroline...
- Nicolas, please don't beg.

283
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:50,718
- I just...
- Maybe another world, another life.

284
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:53,170
- I want...
- You can't leave your wife for me.

285
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:55,221
- No, it's just...
- Seriously! You don't have to say it.

286
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,371
No, I do.

287
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,998
You have a diaper
on your back.

288
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:02,854
I am aware.

289
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,338
What are you working on there? Is that
a family having a picnic at a park?

290
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,901
No,
it's the letter "G"!

291
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:25,892
I haven't written anything
by hand since 1996.

292
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:30,415
Well, my writing's really good. I forge
a lot of checks and prescriptions.

293
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,148
I'm kind of a famous doctor.

294
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:38,099
___

295
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,189
You're really saying it.
That says, "I love you."

296
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,492
No, it's Khloe Kardashian
windsurfing.

297
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:47,861
Yes, Deke, I love you.

298
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,626
Oh, Bebe.

299
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,238
I wasn't expecting you today.
I thought you moved.

300
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:58,665
I'm on my way. My car's outside, but
I remembered I left my medication here.

301
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:06,006
Okay, now where's
the big one?

302
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,873
Well, as long
as you're here,

303
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:11,180
could you show me where
the student financial files are?

304
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:15,567
Sure, they're here in this folder
I've labeled "Depressing."

305
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,086
I wanna check Deke's file
and see if he's on scholarship.

306
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:20,272
He's definitely
not on scholarship.

307
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,507
His family's super rich.
He's a Bromberg.

308
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,859
Wait, Bebe.
Bromberg?

309
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:27,195
I thought Deke's last name
was just "Berg."

310
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:30,477
As in "Ice-" or "Pitts-."

311
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,450
No, he just goes
by Berg for short.

312
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,762
You know, like me,
my full name is Bebebebe.

313
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:42,468
So you're telling me Deke
is from <i>the</i> Bromberg family,

314
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:46,572
as in the Bromberg Elevators... the ones
that are in every building in the city?

315
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:50,125
As in the Bromberg Colo-Rectal
Center at the New York Hospital?

316
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,286
Yeah.

317
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:56,968
You know, I once left a purse and
2 feet of my large intestine there.

318
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,482
Nice knowing you.
Bye.

319
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:05,426
Ooh, I'll be right back.

320
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:08,129
If you mess up our batter,
I'll cut your thing off.

321
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,284
Sweet, I could stand
to lose 5 pounds.

322
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,678
I have some exciting news
to share.

323
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,568
Unless it's about an off-season
Shamrock Shake, I don't care.

324
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:24,821
Your Deke... dumpster Deke...
is actually Deacon Bromberg.

325
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,156
Of the Manhattan Brombergs!
He's rich!

326
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:28,990
What are you talking about?
That is crazy.

327
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:32,554
I would know if he were rich. I wouldn't
have just told a rich guy I love him.

328
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,882
It's all right here.
Isn't this amazing?

329
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:39,001
This is like buying a dress you love
and finding out it's rich.

330
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,632
___

331
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,011
- Whoa, why'd you do that?
- You're rich.

332
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:53,517
- Max, wait.
- You pretended to be poor. Liar.

333
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,569
Ooh, lordy be.

334
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,117
This kind of drama's the reason why
I quit the Ohio State Football Team.

335
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,748
Why are you so upset?

336
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,034
Lying about being rich
is at most a little white lie.

337
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:18,006
It is literally the whitest lie I have
ever heard, and it's a huge deal.

338
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,642
I never would have fallen in love
with someone who has money.

339
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:25,313
We are drastically, massively,
monumentally different people.

340
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,621
Hey, Max, can we talk?

341
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:30,054
Oh, I don't know.
Depends on who I'm talking to.

342
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:34,689
Am I talking to Deke or Deacon
Bromberg, the elevator king?

343
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,775
Man, if you're this upset
about the money,

344
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:40,016
how are you gonna react when
you find out I'm really a woman?

345
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,454
We wouldn't care.

346
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,861
I never tell anybody I'm rich
until after we say I love you

347
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,413
because I don't want money
to change anything.

348
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,716
Money changes everything!

349
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:55,445
Now excuse me.
I gotta do my second job,

350
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:57,113
which you wouldn't
know anything about.

351
00:19:57,158 --> 00:20:00,197
Don't you have
an Ascot Convention to get to?

352
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:01,969
<i>Still here.</i>

353
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,845
<i>Also, two customers
just showed up.</i>

354
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,739
We don't need their money!

355
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,757
We're big, fat liars pretending
to be poor too.

356
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,009
Mm, yeah,
my mom invented dogs.

357
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:17,295
Any time someone buys a dog,
we get 10%!

358
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,651
Now I can't believe it.

359
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,953
Even after three years
with me as a friend,

360
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,721
you still have a thing
against rich people.

361
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,107
Mm-hmm, I do,
because rich people suck.

362
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,877
They think they're better than
everyone and are generally sucky.

363
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,229
So he has money,
I don't want it.

364
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,984
Again, just wildly
different people.

365
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,531
And, Max, just because
he's rich on the outside

366
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,733
doesn't mean he's not like you
on the inside.

367
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,408
Life is complex.

368
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:43,638
I don't wanna see you right now!

369
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:46,594
Hey... I don't wanna
see you either!

370
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:50,225
Just toss me some chocolate
with some cream in the middle!

371
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,856
And speaking of cream
in the middle...

372
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:55,801
Your little homeless boyfriend
is tryin' to get your attention.

373
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:57,988
___

374
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:01,815
He's not homeless, he's not
my boyfriend, he's rich.

375
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:05,512
Rich...?
And he's single...?

376
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:09,352
Oh, maybe I <i>will</i>
take off my heels!

377
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:18,186
