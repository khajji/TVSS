1
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:11,774
- Good evening, ladies.
- No.

2
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:14,091
Max, what are you doing?

3
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:17,528
I know this neighborhood is a circus,
but our window's becoming a freak show.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,398
Max, I don't think that bearded lady
earlier was doing it on purpose.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,117
It's more
of a menopause thing.

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,870
He can't afford a cupcake.
He can't even afford two wheels.

7
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,642
Hi. What can I get you?

8
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:32,910
- I'll take one vanilla.
- That'll be $4.

9
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:36,190
Actually, madam, tonight
I'll be paying with a poem.

10
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,882
We're paying
with a poem, madam.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,754
I pull.
Shadows push.

12
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:45,956
I was a child then.

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,258
I was a child then.

14
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:51,433
Spit it out.

15
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,527
Hey, you want a poem?

16
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,448
Roses are red, violets are blue,
get a job!

17
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:58,844
And another wheel!

18
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:01,905
That felt good.
I get why you do that.

19
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:05,436
Wait till you get actual fist-to-face
contact. That's a real high.

20
00:01:07,477 --> 00:01:10,378
Season 3, Episode 12
"And the French Kiss"

Synced by Reef

22
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,069
Welcome to
the Williamsburg diner, Deke.

23
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:26,117
Where'd you hear about us?
Kitchen nightmares?

24
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,892
Okay, Max, let's get to it.

25
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:32,811
We have to decide what we're each gonna
make for our pastry school homework.

26
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:36,131
Or true to form, I'll blow it off,
beat you up, and take yours.

27
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:40,602
Of the top of my giant head,
I'm thinking sticky buns.

28
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:43,272
Deke's dark sticky buns.

29
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:47,192
We're talking about dessert,
not what's going on in your pants.

30
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,239
Well, I would've baked brownies,
until I remembered

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,162
I smoked
all the ingredients.

32
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,085
Oh, my God,
guess who texted me again.

33
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:59,872
Dame Judi Dench?
Dame Judes texts me all the time.

34
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:01,498
She's thirsty.

35
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:06,161
More like,
"Damn, Judi Drench."

36
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,680
Oh, hi, Deke.
Didn't know you were here.

37
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,020
You're everywhere.

38
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:13,501
Pastry school, on the phone with
Max talking about pastry school,

39
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:16,308
and now here at the counter
talking about elder sex

40
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:18,273
with a beloved star
of stage and screen.

41
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,175
- You're like...
- What?

42
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:23,256
Denzel Washington trapped
in Channing Tatum's body?

43
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,992
I get that a lot.

44
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:31,759
Anyway, Max,

45
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:35,340
this is the fourth time chef Nicolas
has texted me outside of school.

46
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:38,043
And this time
he sent me a video. Look.

47
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,963
<i>Then, Caroline, you spoon
the fat from the pan...</i>

48
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,046
It's him making breakfast
with his shirt open.

49
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,859
What do you think it means?

50
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,678
That he doesn't have
a fear of bacon splatters...?

51
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:54,858
- He's totally flirting with me, right?
- Totally. Chef Nicolas is hot for ya.

52
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,771
He has to double up on aprons when
you're around, know what I'm sayin'?

53
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:02,985
Deke, this is just private
best friend stuff between girls.

54
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,820
You know,
that you're not a part of.

55
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,909
Can I not be a part of it?

56
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:10,183
And since chef Nicolas is your teacher
and I work at the school,

57
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,946
I'd appreciate it if we kept
this just between us three.

58
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:15,063
And me. I saw it
over your shoulder.

59
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:18,743
Doesn't hold a candle to my series
of pantless meatloaf videos.

60
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,372
Meatloaf.
Pick up.

61
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:27,125
Okay, okay, Max, if you have time
to lean, you have time to clean.

62
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:30,441
And if I have time to give you a punch,
we have time to have lunch.

63
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:34,772
Max, should we help him
find his mom?

64
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:42,257
Oh, no, now there's
two of them.

65
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,234
Like gremlins.

66
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,932
Now, come on. This is a diner,
not study hall. You're working.

67
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:52,734
I call it "spiritually dying,"

68
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:54,987
but working's a good word
for what we do here too.

69
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:57,789
We could figure it out
tomorrow night over some drinks.

70
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,275
Couple of white wine spritzers.
Know what I'm sayin'?

71
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:03,862
That you're a recently-widowed
woman on a girls' trip in Boca?

72
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:06,832
Well, I already ate my water,
so I'm good to go.

73
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,718
I am out the door.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,237
Hi, I'm Deke.
Bye, Max.

75
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,173
Oh, he's your friend?

76
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:18,828
For a minute I thought he was that kid
I had out of wedlock with Linda Evans.

77
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:24,711
Okay, why are you in here not working?
And why are you doing it without me?

78
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:28,909
Look, I've been texting with Nicolas.
He <i>thirstay</i>.

79
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:33,179
He wants me to meet him for a drink
after his dinner tomorrow.

80
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,911
<i>After</i> his dinner.
You know what that means.

81
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:37,550
That he thinks he doesn't
have to buy you dinner

82
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,645
before he makes you
his slam piece?

83
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,950
"After dinner"
is a Booty call.

84
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:45,807
Or as they say in France,
"A call du bootay."

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,789
So I need you
to hang out with me,

86
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,758
because if I don't have anything
else to do at that time,

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,376
I won't be able
to resist him.

88
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,633
I don't see it.

89
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:56,212
Maybe because he never pulled a knife
on me, but to me he's, like, asexual.

90
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:01,353
Yeah, like <i>a sexual object</i>.

91
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,939
Okay, well, I told Deke I'd help
him with his homework,

92
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,273
so you can
hang out with us.

93
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:08,895
Hang out with Deke?
I didn't even like the Muppets on TV.

94
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,947
But fine, it'll...
It'll keep me busy,

95
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,182
because Max,
when Nicolas looks at me,

96
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,284
it does something
to my insides,

97
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,120
and I want this
to be a relationship

98
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:21,456
before he does
something to my insides.

99
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:25,850
If you keep talking about your insides,
I'm gonna kick you on your outsides.

100
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,957
Okay, so as far
as my dessert homework goes...

101
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,324
He just texted me again.

102
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,425
<i>"Ou es-tu?"</i>
"Where are you?"

103
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:37,270
And he used <i>"tu"</i>,
not <i>"vous."</i>

104
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,515
We've gone there.

105
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,851
Then why are you still here?

106
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:45,603
Because I can't go there, Max,
I'm not ready.

107
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:48,077
Oh, wax situation?

108
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,141
Guys don't care about that.

109
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,011
So as far as my dessert goes,
I went all-out

110
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:55,730
and actually did
some real research.

111
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:59,400
- You googled desserts with dirty names?
<i>- Correcto</i>.

112
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,035
And it was harder
to pick one than I thought.

113
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:04,489
I mean, you got your <i>bundt cake</i>,
your <i>lady fingers</i>,

114
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,945
<i>kumquat pie</i>...

115
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,229
"Kum" and "quat".

116
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,821
It was right there the whole
time. How could I not see it?

117
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,532
So I dug deep,
and I have the winner.

118
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:17,001
<i>Croquembouche</i>.

119
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,128
I don't know what that is,
but she sounds like a whore.

120
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,058
It's a traditional
French wedding cake

121
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,645
with vanilla cream-filled profiteroles
dipped in hand-made caramel.

122
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:31,015
Said the only person here
not in pastry school.

123
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,984
Oh, cool.
I didn't know what it was.

124
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,897
Maybe I can help. I happen to know Nicolas
loves a <i>pear tarte tatin</i>.

125
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:44,109
Ta-ta-tan! No.

126
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,283
I thought I'd distract myself
by going out with you guys,

127
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:49,784
but it feels like
the day in high school

128
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,031
I hung out with the smokers
for street cred.

129
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:56,457
And I used to hang out with rich geeks
like you when I needed lunch money.

130
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,376
I'm texting Nicolas.

131
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:00,323
What? You said you didn't
want him to think you were up

132
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:02,941
for a wham-bam,
thank you, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

133
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,017
You're right, Max.
I shouldn't text him.

134
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,637
He just texted me again.
What's one drink?

135
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,576
$18...?

136
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:14,776
It is?
Yeah, you better text him.

137
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:16,930
We need a grown-up
to pay for the drinks.

138
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,615
I'll just say I'm with friends,
and he can join for a drink.

139
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,867
Isn't that what people do?
I forget.

140
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:25,820
I haven't been a person
or done anything in so long.

141
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,557
Or done a person in so long.

142
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,492
I won't let it get that far.

143
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,328
And by that I mean you won't.

144
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,463
I'll give you a signal and then
you'll say we have to go.

145
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:38,208
What's the signal?
Full penetration?

146
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:46,021
- No, before that.
- So, just the tip?

147
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,404
I think I'll just wink.

148
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,852
So, <i>croquembouche?</i>

149
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,948
I can't pretend to talk.

150
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,030
I hope his tongue
is wearing protection.

151
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:29,579
Hey.

152
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:32,364
Are we making you
uncomfortable?

153
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,227
No, no, it's just that
I usually like to fast-forward

154
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,705
through the kissing parts
when I watch porn.

155
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:41,957
Come on, relax, Max.
We're just having some fun.

156
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,910
It's just that you're our teacher,
and your spittle is all over her mouth.

157
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:49,665
We're not in class.
Do you see batter or bowls?

158
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,718
Well, we're hoping
not to see any balls.

159
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:57,779
I see the outline
of one of 'em.

160
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,972
Just don't think of me
as a teacher right now.

161
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,909
Well, I'm kind of
learning a lot.

162
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:10,479
You know, for someone
who wasn't gonna have sex,

163
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:12,442
she's having sex.

164
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,002
I'm leaving.

165
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:16,327
I haven't felt this awkward

166
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:19,712
since my mom had sex with my prom
date in the limo and made me drive.

167
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,995
Your mom sounds cool.

168
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,295
Come on, you can't leave.
We just got here.

169
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:29,712
Well, she's about to get there,
and I don't wanna see it.

170
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,301
Well, we can make out.

171
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:35,617
You wanna make out? With me?

172
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,013
No, a comedy make-out.

173
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,799
You know, like...

174
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:49,858
Well, you make it look
so tempting.

175
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,977
Come on,
it'll be hilarious.

176
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:54,811
Let my mouth be
your tongue's panic room.

177
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:57,483
And chef Nicolas
could use a few pointers.

178
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:07,089
Yeah, he's really
bad at it.

179
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:10,217
All right, why not? It might
even get their attention.

180
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,735
On the count of three.
One, two...

181
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,067
- Did they look?
- No, he's busy rounding third.

182
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,758
My turn.

183
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:28,251
Max, what's happening?

184
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,841
Hey.

185
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,450
He's licking your face.

186
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:41,613
Leave them alone.

187
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,548
Deke seems to know
what he's doing.

188
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,751
Respect.

189
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:50,725
Well, hate to comedy
make out and run,

190
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:53,355
but, well, I'm already
mentally at yummy donuts

191
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:56,523
trying to binge eat
this image out of my mind.

192
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,393
Hold on, Max. The signal.

193
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,880
See, this is why
I don't do girlfriend.

194
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:11,108
Come on, we have somewhere to go
or be, something like that.

195
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,171
Well...

196
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:22,078
We have to go.
See you later.

197
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,744
<i>Au revoir.</i>

198
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,543
'Sup?

199
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,385
Not much.
<i>'Sup</i> with you?

200
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,488
Sorry, I have to get this.
It's my wife.

201
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,362
Hello?

202
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,231
Girrrl...

203
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:03,997
Oh, I totally forgot to tell you.
You're terrible at making out.

204
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,921
Well, I never had
a father to teach me.

205
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,404
Hey, big Mary.

206
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,505
Hallway lunch.
Love that for you.

207
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:16,156
And you.

208
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:20,197
This could've been your walk of shame
right now if I hadn't stepped in, Winky.

209
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,371
Yes, last night
got a little out of hand.

210
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:25,644
Oh, it was pretty much
in your hand.

211
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:28,229
No, it was not, Max.

212
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,525
Yes, there might have been
a tasteful graze,

213
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,828
just to figure out
how European he was down there.

214
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,398
Good news, it's not
wearing a floppy beret.

215
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,677
So we are right on track for
a perfect fairy-tale romance.

216
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:40,678
Yeah, the princess
and the penis.

217
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:43,666
See you at the diner, Max.
<i>Au revoir, mes amis.</i>

218
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:47,075
I have to kinda
tell you something

219
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:50,578
that you have to promise you
kind of definitely won't tell Caroline.

220
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,647
Are you about to tell me
that when she speaks French

221
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,533
it makes you want to slam your head
through that plate-glass window too?

222
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,820
Heh. Well, the thing is
he's married.

223
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:01,589
He's married?
How do you know?

224
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,509
He's not wearing a ring,
and he doesn't seem dead inside.

225
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:08,930
- His wife called him after you guys left.
- How could he do that?

226
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:12,384
- He's French?
- And not tell Caroline.

227
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,270
- He's French?
- What a jerk.

228
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,302
<i>Fronch?</i>

229
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,662
I'm telling her right now.

230
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,979
Wait, wait, wait, Max,
do me a favor...?

231
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,896
Can you just wait until after
I turn in my <i>croquembouche?</i>

232
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,729
I'm already on thin ice
with <i>"au bon pain</i> in my ass."

233
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,852
This sucks.

234
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:32,187
He's married, and Caroline
has this weird thing in her head

235
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,591
that she has to marry
someone who isn't married.

236
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,211
<i>Bonjour, Bebe. Ca va?</i>

237
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:41,945
Oh, boy.

238
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,579
I'm not really good
with any languages.

239
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,573
They think it's because
I got hit by three cars.

240
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:51,213
FYI, if you ever get hit,
just stay down.

241
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,306
Well, guess what.

242
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:56,874
I got you and me salads.
Girls' lunch.

243
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,672
Well, I usually just have peanut
butter and crackers in the dark...

244
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:05,160
I hear so much about salad
I've always wanted to try it.

245
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:10,724
Sure. Sit. Have some salad.
You and me, me and you.

246
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,827
Getting to know
more about each other.

247
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,030
So Bebe, tell me
everything about Nicolas.

248
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:20,351
He's the best. He has
the heart and eyes of a dog.

249
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:26,374
- So Nicolas, where do you think he is?
- He just said he had a lunch date.

250
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:30,460
Date? Did he use the word "date," or
are you just using the word "date"?

251
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:33,402
I mean, it's not like he's dating anyone.
Is he?

252
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:36,250
No, why would he
be dating anyone?

253
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,686
Exactly, why would he
be dating anyone?

254
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:40,755
Yeah, I mean,
he's married.

255
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,442
Married?

256
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:48,532
You know, salad tastes
just like lettuce.

257
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,428
You are not
going to believe this.

258
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,735
Kendall Jenner
is applying to colleges?

259
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,184
Come on, Max, no.

260
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:09,770
Nicolas is... and get ready...
Married.

261
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,106
I kissed a married man.
I'm so mortified.

262
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:14,242
Please don't ever tell anyone
I kissed a married man.

263
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:16,434
Okay, I won't tell anyone.

264
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,748
- Tell anyone what?
- Caroline kissed a married man.

265
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,716
But don't tell anyone.

266
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,923
All right, I want to go on the record
that I didn't know.

267
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:29,373
Kissing a married man has never
been in my life plan.

268
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,342
It's not on my vision board
or in my dreamscape.

269
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,927
I am not that kind of person.

270
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:35,129
But she is the kind of person
who has a vision board

271
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,637
and says "dreamscape,"
so let's judge her on that.

272
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,605
I won't judge you, Caroline.

273
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,189
I once went out
with a married woman.

274
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,276
I didn't know she was married until
her spouse came and beat me up.

275
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,818
Lesbians are strong.

276
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,019
Listen, married, not married,
don't be so American.

277
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,955
You know, in Poland,
the wedding vows say,

278
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,041
"Do you take this woman..."

279
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,707
"And maybe some others?"

280
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,164
Well, not Polish,
and not a lesbian yet.

281
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,033
So I'm very upset.

282
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,751
And, Max, why are you
just standing there?

283
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:11,256
Why haven't you
said anything?

284
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,107
Um...
I kind of knew.

285
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:20,694
Wait. You <i>kind of knew</i>
he was married?

286
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,780
You kind of knew and didn't
kind of tell me?

287
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,307
- What kind of friend are you?
- I just found out myself.

288
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,775
Well, then why didn't
you tell me?

289
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,726
I was going to,
but then Deke asked me not to

290
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:30,195
until he handed in
his homework.

291
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,729
And also I thought
you might cry.

292
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:36,344
- Oh, and you didn't want to upset me?
- Nah, I didn't want to deal with it.

293
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,622
'Cause when you cry, you don't just
cry once. It's like a six-cry thing.

294
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,540
You've got the first shock cry,
the silent cry,

295
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,459
the ugly cry,
the cry because you're crying,

296
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,211
the cry after you say
you're not gonna cry anymore,

297
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,702
and then the final cry,
which is probably my fault.

298
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,384
Well, you're wrong, Max,
I'm not gonna cry over this,

299
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,386
because I haven't gone
far enough down the road.

300
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,934
Yes, I was just beginning to think about
our future, but I'm not that invested.

301
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,933
- Then what's this?
- My dupe pad.

302
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,265
That's right. And look what
I found written on the back.

303
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,683
"Caroline and Nicolas
Saintcroix."

304
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,852
"Mr. and Mrs. Saintcroix."

305
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:12,821
"Caroline Saintcroix."

306
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,690
That's just being silly.
Every girl does that.

307
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,285
You're 40.

308
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:24,565
- Oh, man, this is heavy.
- I know, very heavy.

309
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:25,900
We're back here,
and I have to deal with the fact

310
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,755
that I was dry-humped
by a married man.

311
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,290
No, I think he meant
his dessert is heavy.

312
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,621
But yeah, you got
a lot going on.

313
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:36,628
So what do you
want us to do?

314
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,246
Should we throw down?
Mess his ass up?

315
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:40,081
Kick him in the face?

316
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,600
Or just ignore it so I don't
get kicked out of school?

317
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:45,353
No, I'll deal
with Nicolas later.

318
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:49,183
You sure? 'Cause I've always
wanted to kill a French person.

319
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,216
Again.

320
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:58,032
Thanks, but stay out of it.
I've got this.

321
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,328
I'm gonna rip him
a new one.

322
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:03,025
<i>- Bonjour, Caroline.
- Bonjour, Nicolas.</i>

323
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,492
That wasn't a rip.
Wasn't even a tear.

324
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,277
Go, go, you two.
Got a big, hot <i>bundt</i> here.

325
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,832
Go, go, don't be late.

326
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,750
You sure that's
a <i>croquembouche?</i>

327
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:18,469
'Cause it looks like a
coyote poop tree.

328
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:21,923
Caroline, can you
watch the phones for me

329
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:24,525
while I give chef Nicolas
this note from his wife?

330
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:26,183
You know what?
I'll give it to him.

331
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:28,073
I have something
I have to say to him anyway.

332
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,733
Oh, for next girls' lunch,
have you ever had sandwiches?

333
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,056
'Cause I'm thinking
of trying one.

334
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,227
Not you.

335
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,955
You have got this.
You have got this.

336
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:48,983
You broke up with a Kennedy cousin.
You can do this.

337
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:51,085
Caroline,
do you need something?

338
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:54,422
I just wanted to give you
this phone message you just got.

339
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,452
From your wife.

340
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,929
From your wife...
Juliette...?

341
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,497
- I know her name.
- You're married.

342
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:06,311
Yes, you just got
a message from my wife.

343
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:11,339
I feel like something's getting
lost in the translation here,

344
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:14,508
so let me be clear.
It's over between us.

345
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,054
Why?

346
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,365
Why?
Because you're married.

347
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,670
Again, I know that.
But why?

348
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,621
What... what do
you mean "why"?

349
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,376
Why? Because you are married.
<i>Vous est marie!</i>

350
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,946
And note, I did not
use <i>"tu"</i>

351
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:37,382
because we are back
on the more formal <i>"vous"</i> terms.

352
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:42,187
Look, Caroline, my wife is in France,
and we have an understanding.

353
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:46,006
Well, I'm having a hard time
understanding any of this.

354
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,761
And whatever arrangement you and Juliette
have, it's over between you and me.

355
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,085
Here.

356
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:56,717
You are very cute
when you're angry.

357
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,636
I am?

358
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:02,607
Actually, you are very cute
all the time. Cute and sexy.

359
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,993
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to...

360
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,112
- Put my lips onto yours.
- You did?

361
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,614
Yes.

362
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:13,534
Caroline, you are a smart,
sexy, delicious woman.

363
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:16,838
And now that I've kissed...
Do you have something in your eye?

364
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,589
No, no, no, no, no.

365
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:24,245
It's never you!

366
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,016
I'm sorry, what is happening?

367
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,552
Chef Nicolas, uh, you need
to get back in there

368
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,220
because the chef
with the neck tattoo

369
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,188
is trying to pass off
a store-bought tiramisu.

370
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,708
There is one every year.

371
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,528
Caroline.

372
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,432
Are you okay?
What did he say?

373
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:47,759
He said he's married, and
it's confusing, and I'm delicious.

374
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,405
Okay, well, he's married, it's
confusing, and you're delicious.

375
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,792
So you're
Mrs. Delicious Saintcroix.

376
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,660
So it's over, right?

377
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:58,546
Yeah, of course it's over.
No drama, no more crying.

378
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,304
- I would never be with a married man.
- Yeah, that's more my thing.

379
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,471
Oh, my God, Max, you know
what I just realized?

380
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,891
I once said I would
never be a waitress.

381
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,714
Girrrl...

382
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:20,023
