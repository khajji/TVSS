1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,294
Hey, I'm sleeping
at Deke's house tonight.

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,379
Wink, wink, winky-wink.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:10,567
Deke's house? You mean
your boyfriend's dumpster?

4
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:12,435
Yeah. So I need a, uh...

5
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,638
Tetanus shot?

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,439
Higher standards?

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,308
No, a condom.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,077
I'm about to have sex,
and I want it to feel bad.

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,347
I should have one in my purse
from the last time I had sex.

10
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:26,733
They had purses
the last time you had sex?

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,654
No, we carried animal hides
tied with sticks.

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,572
It hasn't been that long.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:38,078
Oh, here's one next to this
movie ticket stub from Precious.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,529
Okay, it's been that long.

15
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,966
You saw Precious without a condom?

16
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:46,369
It says, "Best if used
before September 2012."

17
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,388
Just like the milk here.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,707
I wish I knew a guy with a condom.

19
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:00,717
A man, any man.

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,018
Oleg, do you happen to have...

21
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:09,259
Okay, this should get you
through the night.

22
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:10,727
But if it doesn't,

23
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,115
You can use this freezer bag
and a rubber band.

24

25
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:32,175
Max, I laid out the little cups,

26
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,977
so all you have to do
is fill them with cole slaw.

27
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,097
Said the girl who was on the
Forbes "top ten to watch" list.

28
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,482
I can't do my side work tonight.

29
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,184
Normally I'd say
it's because I'm drunk,

30
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:44,237
But tonight it's because
my back hurts and I'm drunk.

31
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,190
Here, babe, I got you something
that might help your back feel better.

32
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,886
A breast reduction?

33
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:52,358
No!

34
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:57,784
Why would you spit in the face of God?

35
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:02,701
Everybody, calm down.
Those aren't going anywhere.

36
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,175
And if they are,
I am going with them.

37
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,828
I got some cooling patches
to soothe her muscles.

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,746
And when that doesn't work,

39
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:13,883
I have another brand
called "maui wowie."

40
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,551
Pickup.

41
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,203
- I'll see you later. Love you.
- Love you.

42
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,339
Deke, breath.
What is that?

43
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,075
Teriyaki beef jerky.
Why, is it bad?

44
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,512
No. Give me another hit.

45
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,800
That is delicious.

46
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:33,319
You know it.

47
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,593
Max, since you guys are getting serious,
why not go on the pill,

48
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:44,697
so every night you won't have to play
"What can we turn into a condom?"

49
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,866
The pill is, like, 50 bucks a month.

50
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,785
That's more than it costs
to raise a damn baby.

51
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:53,572
Well, your boyfriend's rich.
He can afford to pay for it.

52
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:57,426
Great, now I'm a white trash mom.

53
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,128
Uh-uh, no way.

54
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,547
I'm saving Deke's fortune
for more important things,

55
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,800
like Doritos Dinamita.

56
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,720
Pretty much the filet mignon
of corn chips.

57
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,755
I mean, I'd be on the pill right now,

58
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,691
But the one man interested
in me is married,

59
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,276
so I guess that's more of a bitter pill.

60
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,145
Seriously, Max. Think about it.

61
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:18,698
Fine. Why don't
guys have to take the pill?

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,434
We have to take all the pills.
Birth control, Midol, roofies...

63
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:25,905
Bonjour, Caroline.

64
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,041
Chef Nicolas.
What are you doing in the diner?

65
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,494
Oh, no, I never wanted you
to see me wearing this.

66
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:33,546
Yeah, so be a gentleman
and take a step back,

67
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:37,066
'cause as bad as it looks,
it smells worse.

68
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,784
I think you look beautiful.

69
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,787
Your wife looks beautiful.

70
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,308
Oh, yeah. Get it, girl.

71
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,793
May I see you alone
over there in the, uh...

72
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:51,063
I guess one would call it a restaurant?

73
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,898
But just for a minute. I'm working.

74
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:55,568
What's that smell?

75
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,269
That's today's special. Beef pot pie.

76
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,971
Oh, it doesn't smell like beef.

77
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,489
That's because it's not beef,

78
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,160
it's not made today,
and it's not special.

79
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,311
Listen, Caroline.

80
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,279
We have all this relationship drama,

81
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,031
And we're not even in a relationship.

82
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,316
Please get to know me better.

83
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,818
Come to my home for dinner.

84
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,154
Dinner at your home, just you and me?

85
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,889
How do you think your wife
would feel about that?

86
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,791
We have an open relationship.

87
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,593
Did you think I'm the type of man

88
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:25,097
who would have sex with another
woman without asking my wife?

89
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,883
That is so American.

90
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:30,269
Max?

91
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,771
Why are you calling Max?

92
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:33,639
I want to make sure
I haven't lost my mind.

93
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,108
Nicolas said he told his wife about me,

94
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,611
and she gave him permission
for us to sleep together.

95
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,814
Ha! Good one!

96
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,950
My boss at Quiznos once told me
his wife's dying wish

97
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,621
was that I let him motorboat me.

98
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:52,625
Okay, so she may have been
motorboated out of Quiznos.

99
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,493
But I am not falling for this.

100
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,629
Yes, I thought you wouldn't believe me,

101
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,531
so I set up a Skype call
with her from France on Friday.

102
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:03,886
Wait, you want me to Skype
with your wife about sex?

103
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,055
Am I on Dr. Phil?

104
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:09,425
Hey, everybody.

105
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,981
I got a new dress, and it's bitchin'.

106
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,385
Oh.

107
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:23,272
Hey, look at him. Oh.

108
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:27,943
Nobody told me they added
beefcake to the menu.

109
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:33,783
Excuse me, beefcake has been on the menu
since I started working here.

110
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:37,403
Wow, wow.

111
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,755
Finally...

112
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:43,425
There's somebody in the diner
as good-looking as me.

113
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,680
Hi, I'm Sophie Kuchenski.

114
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,215
Nicolas Saintcroix.

115
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:50,800
Ah!

116
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:52,968
And he's French too?

117
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,222
Oh, come on!

118
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:59,408
I'm sorry, I was in the middle
of a conversation with Caroline.

119
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,031
Who?

120
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,317
Me, the one whose feet
you're standing on.

121
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,736
Oh.

122
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,872
Oh, wait a minute.

123
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,457
Is this the married guy?

124
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,411
Oh, girl!

125
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:23,382
I'm gonna give you two days'
head start, and then he's mine!

126
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,954
Why do you care what his wife
thinks about your hair?

127
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:41,223
You're not gonna be sleeping with her.

128
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:44,309
Although you'd be a lot
more interesting if you did.

129
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:46,345
I'm not gonna be
sleeping with him either.

130
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:49,047
And when I tell his wife that,
I want to look good doing it.

131
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,300
I have to look 20% better than her.

132
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,051
And since Skype makes you
look 20% worse,

133
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,888
I have to look 40% better
than I do now.

134
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,710
You realize talking about math in
a hair salon is my worst nightmare, right?

135
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,529
Welcome to the Tristan Evans salon.

136
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:07,182
Hi, hello. We're here
for the student haircut.

137
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:09,218
I'm sorry?

138
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,553
The $6 haircuts for poor people

139
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,989
from the people who don't really
know how to cut hair yet.

140
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:17,159
Max, that's not true.
This is the Tristan Evans salon.

141
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,795
I'm sure that everyone that's
enrolled here is a genius.

142
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,914
At least tell me they're gay.

143
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,749
Just have a seat over there.

144
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,193
I'll have somebody come up
from the hair school and...

145
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,870
Shh! So loud.

146
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,588
Hair school. Got it.

147
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,307
We'll just take a seat
over there till they arrive.

148
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:35,010
Girl, you just sit there, relax,

149
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:38,297
and let Jameis make this head major.

150
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,717
So weird, 'cause I majored in head.

151
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:45,220
Girl, you are all everything.

152
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,222
Ah...oh!

153
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,557
That's a little cold.

154
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,025
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

155
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:52,093
Dan.

156
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,563
Uh-huh. Dan?
So just Dan?

157
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,316
You're not, like,
a Danny or a Dantrell?

158
00:07:57,318 --> 00:08:00,402
Dan.

159
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:02,454
I need to get conditioner.

160
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,990
Damn it, Max, I got a straight one.

161
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,708
What makes you think
he's straight?

162
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,396
He keeps pushing my head down
before I'm ready.

163
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,383
Is the water too warm?

164
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:17,186
Why? Are my pants too wet?

165
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,472
Girl, are we in love?

166
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,175
Max, I need you to give me your gay.

167
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:24,960
Yeah, right.

168
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,347
I'd give you my left nut
before I give you my gay.

169
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,465
You weren't even
gonna get your hair done.

170
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:34,069
Yeah, but I always wanted to know
what it felt like to get a shampoo

171
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:37,739
without a school nurse running
that tiny comb through my hair.

172
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:38,824
Dan?

173
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,259
I have a magazine over there

174
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,161
with a photo of a chic,
piece-y, choppy bob.

175
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:44,346
You can do that, right?

176
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:45,414
Sure.

177
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,816
Piece-y bob. Got it.

178
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:50,752
'sup?

179
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:55,457
Dan, Dan, Dan!

180
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,095
Okay, done.
You're ready to cut.

181
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:04,132
Let's go. I can't risk some
discount hetero cutting my hair.

182
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:07,669
I'll see you at home.
I'm pretty close to a hairgasm.

183
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,187
That should've been mine.

184
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,723
I haven't had a hairgasm in years.

185
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,842
She hasn't had any gasm in years.

186
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,177
Ooh!

187
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,987
Oh, my God!

188
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:29,374
Max, is that hair
your new form of birth control?

189
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,627
You look like Dame Edna.

190
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:34,696
That's what I asked for!

191
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,798
Hellooo!

192
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,369
Now my outside matches my inside,

193
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,255
because I've always been
an old drag queen

194
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:46,008
trapped inside the body
of a young black girl.

195
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,481
Hellooo!

196
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:54,099
Oh, hi, Max.

197
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:56,401
Oh, I used to wear my hair like that.

198
00:09:56,403 --> 00:10:00,739
I used it to smuggle cheese
and cigarettes into the prison.

199
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,691
Oh, hey, Caroline.

200
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,493
Just checking.

201
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:08,196
Still not sleeping with that French guy
that I'm sleeping with?

202
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,298
Still not, Sophie.
He's married.

203
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,034
Well, good.

204
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:16,455
'cause I'm here to talk to that wife,
and throw my hoo-ha into the ring.

205
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:20,575
I even bought myself a flat French hat
to make me more French.

206
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:26,081
Yeah, I got me the hat 'cause I didn't
have time to grow out my pits.

207
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,452
Okay, the call is in one minute.
I'll just do it from here.

208
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,304
I was planning to be holding
my Louis Vuitton shopping bag,

209
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,272
but the cat took a dump in it.

210
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,591
And, Max, bring that lamp
closer to my face,

211
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,527
So I don't have eight Skype chins.

212
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,230
Fine, but if I get too close to
the bulb, my hair might blow up.

213
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,499
Here she is.

214
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:45,784
Sophie, good-bye.

215
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,953
Oh, no, I'm not leaving, baby.

216
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:50,939
That French hottie and I
are perfect for each other.

217
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,708
I mean, look at me.

218
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,211
I'm wearing a beret.
I have a baguette.

219
00:10:56,213 --> 00:11:00,165
Bonjour, bitches!

220
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:04,119
Okay, take a deep breath,
and remember, this is ridiculous.

221
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,257
Bonjour, Caroline.

222
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,093
Bonjour. You must be Juliette.

223
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,611
It is nice to meet you.

224
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,396
And you as well, Juliette.

225
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,064
I just want to set the record
straight about Nicolas and I.

226
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,632
I am not the type of...

227
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:20,569
Yes, you have my permission
to sleep with Nicolas.

228
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:23,138
Au revoir.

229
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,490
That's it? She's gone?

230
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:29,477
I didn't even get to say
"hos before bros" in French.

231
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,363
So much more to say.

232
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,647
What more is there to say?

233
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,452
She said we could sleep with him.

234
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:41,256
No, I'm never sleeping with Nicolas,
no matter what his wife says.

235
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,375
Good, 'cause you could never
share a French guy.

236
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:45,744
You won't even share your French toast.

237
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:55,998
Thanks for coming.

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,968
I promise, just one drink at Nicolas's,
and then we'll go to the movies.

239
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,870
And, Max, I can't believe
you went out with that hair in public.

240
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,622
I like it.

241
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:07,009
You look like my aunt Esther,
but not as hot.

242
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,078
Oh, Caroline.

243
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,680
I see you brought Deke

244
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:14,450
And Max's mother?

245
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:19,421
The only thing this hair and my mother
have in common is they're both high.

246
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,523
Nicolas, I'm not staying.

247
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,425
I know you went to a lot
of trouble with dinner,

248
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:26,278
so I didn't want to be rude, but
we can only stay for one drink.

249
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,696
God, you look beautiful.

250
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:29,097
Maybe two drinks.

251
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,400
But definitely no dinner.

252
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:38,540
Well, that dinner we weren't
staying for was delicious.

253
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,827
Yeah, we should not stay more often.

254
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,946
I like your loft, man.

255
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:47,800
It's the perfect place to live
if you like to commit really sexy crimes.

256
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,335
Well, we should go.

257
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:51,420
No. You're not staying for dessert?

258
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:52,805
You're breaking my heart.

259
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:56,091
Well, maybe just one piece.
We can share it.

260
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,913
I thought you didn't want to share.

261
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:05,184
He's not married to his dessert, Max,
and it's just one piece.

262
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:08,671
We're here, so he doesn't get a piece.

263
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:12,691
You got a pretty sweet setup
for a married man who's single.

264
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,861
Creme caramel au coconut cake.

265
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,646
Well, it's no Fudgie the Whale.

266
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:19,264
Thanks.

267
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,917
I love to cook for friends.

268
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,519
Beautiful friends.

269
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:26,422
Nicolas, just because
your wife gave me permission

270
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:28,207
does not mean I'm gonna
let you take me over

271
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,677
To that king-size bed with what
looks like really good sheets

272
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,096
and make love to me all night long.

273
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,682
And then again that morning.

274
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,834
So how's your back, Esther?

275
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:40,519
Oh, Morty.

276
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,887
I have to tell you something.

277
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,073
Is it your heart?

278
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,524
No, I'm on the pill.

279
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,943
I know.
You're on a lot of pills.

280
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:49,528
No, a pill-pill.

281
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,947
The pill-pill-pill?

282
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:53,232
Yeah, see?

283
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,366
You just pop 'em out one at a time.

284
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:57,286
They're like pez for sluts.

285
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:03,325
Speaking of sluts...

286
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,911
Oh, boy, this is awkward.

287
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,964
And I've testified
against half my family.

288
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:12,968
I agree, Max.
Things are a little uncomfortable.

289
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,588
So why don't we just make this
as weird as possible?

290
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,008
Damn it, I knew he was gonna kill us.

291
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:24,346
Tango, anyone?

292
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:27,366
Honestly, I prefer if you kill us.

293
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:31,052
Okay, well, we gotta go, Esther.

294
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:33,772
No, Morty, sit down!
I'm not missing the show.

295
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,492
It comes with dinner.

296
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:39,060
Tango? Nicolas, you cannot be serious.

297
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,730
Oh, maybe you cannot dance,
Caroline?

298
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,699
Can't dance?

299
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:48,069
One summer, I taught ballroom
dance to homeless teens.

300
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,173
Because when you're dancing,
you're not hungry?

301
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,296
Fast-forward.

302
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:01,567
This is my least favorite part
of the Addams Family.

303
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,275
- Look at his pants.
- I know.

304
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,945
That tango is giving him
even less ball room.

305
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,734
Stay. We don't have to have sex.

306
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:19,768
We don't?

307
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,153
I promise.

308
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:25,174
I have to go to the restroom, Max.
So do you.

309
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:29,411
Come in, come in,
come in, come in, come in.

310
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,946
Okay, where's the coke?

311
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,798
There is no coke.

312
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,551
Why would you call anyone
into a bathroom if you don't have coke?

313
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:36,785
That's rude.

314
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,221
No, I was just gonna talk to you.

315
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,507
Oh, then I'm definitely
gonna need coke.

316
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,092
Okay, look.
You are not sleeping with him.

317
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:45,928
Of course not.

318
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,846
But tonight I'm thinking
there's something special here.

319
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,798
I mean, we talked, and we laughed.

320
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,234
What is this,
"previously on Caroline"?

321
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:55,020
Hey.

322
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,271
If you guys are doing blow
in here without me,

323
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:59,525
I'm gonna be so pissed.

324
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,009
I wish.

325
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,829
No, Caroline wants
to have sex with Nicolas.

326
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,031
Even after that tango?

327
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:10,285
Listen, now I'm thinking I want
to sleep over, but not have sex.

328
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:13,789
Is that where he puts it in
but doesn't move it around?

329
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,627
That's what I do
when you're passed out.

330
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:21,463
That's what I do when you're passed out.

331
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,599
Look, nothing is
going in anywhere.

332
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,267
I just want to get to know him better.

333
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:28,003
You really think you can
sleep in his bed with him,

334
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,722
and not use his penis
as a body pillow?

335
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,441
Of course.

336
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:34,109
I've done that with every boy
on the upper east side.

337
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:37,479
That's why they called me
the East Side Snuggler.

338
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:39,064
And trust me,

339
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,732
even though his wife begged me
to have sex with him,

340
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,517
I'm not going to.

341
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,987
But didn't you tell us the whole
reason you dragged us here

342
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:47,005
was because you were afraid
of being alone with him?

343
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,825
What is this,
"previously on Caroline"?

344
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:51,460
Look, I get it.

345
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:54,796
And if you two really don't think
I'm capable of not having sex with him,

346
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,999
Then hang out for a bit
until you're sure that I'm fine.

347
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:00,869
Fine, but we are not staying all night.

348
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,893
Here are some blankets for you,
Max and Deke.

349
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,561
You can take the couch.

350
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,480
Caroline and I will take the bed.

351
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,732
Once again, our apologies.

352
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,652
We are just too drunk to go.

353
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:17,986
Too drunk!

354
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:20,272
You did share that one glass of wine.

355
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:23,375
Yup, we are too drunk.

356
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,194
So, too drunk to walk?

357
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:28,697
Well, I don't know.
You be the judge.

358
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:34,586
I am so sorry about this.

359
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,237
It's fine, Caroline.

360
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,339
I know what's going on here.

361
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:40,075
Oh, and, Nicolas, before you go,

362
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:44,412
I just wanted to say
thanks again for the drinks,

363
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:48,884
the dinner, the dessert,

364
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:52,354
my pillow, and Deke's pillow.

365
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:57,192
We get it, Grandma. Good night.
We'll be right over there.

366
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:59,645
And I'll be right over here.

367
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:03,372
Good night, sleep tight, don't let
the bedbugs have sex with you.

368
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:08,070
Uh, you and I are gonna
do it, right?

369
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,939
Oh, yeah. Think I took
my pill this morning.

370
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:13,942
Either that or I didn't take my pill.

371
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:15,610
Wow, Max, this is a big step

372
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,296
that you may or may not
have taken today.

373
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:19,915
You know if it's too much trouble,
we don't have to go off condoms.

374
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:23,885
So you're the one guy in the world
who wants to still wear a condom?

375
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,053
Do you have something?

376
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,421
No, it's not like that.

377
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm just saying the pill
is a big commitment.

378
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,560
Oh, so do you not want
to take this step?

379
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:33,095
Because I already went
to planned parenthood,

380
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:34,613
And I never plan anything.

381
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,630
Max, I guess I'm just surprised...

382
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,265
Hold that thought.

383
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,901
- I hear nothing.
- So?

384
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:43,772
So that's what Caroline
sounds like during sex!

385
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,240
Keep talking like I'm here.

386
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:48,327
Uh...

387
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,196
Ah, oh, yeah, baby!

388
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,981
Right there!
That's the spot!

389
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:57,319
Yeah, now slap my face with 'em!

390
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,955
Well, if you were still here,
that's what I'd be saying.

391
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:02,257
I'm sorry, I'll switch it up.

392
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,327
Uh, go fish, Max.

393
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:10,132
- Max, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

394
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:14,169
We're fine.
We're just lying here talking.

395
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:16,621
No, we're not.
I'm really turned on.

396
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,974
Why?
What's he doing to you?

397
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:22,361
It's not him, it's me.
I'm the predator here.

398
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,863
You were right. You better stop me.
Get up here with us.

399
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,466
I'm not getting in bed with you.

400
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:31,019
Max, get in the bed.

401
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:33,622
I know a Jaques-block when I see one.

402
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:35,991
I am so sorry.

403
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:38,526
This is silly.
I know it must be hard for you.

404
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:42,414
Uh, not anymore.

405
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,704
You know, last night
when you and I were in bed,

406
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:52,924
I realized I guess Nicolas is just gonna
be one of those people in my life

407
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,893
that I'm always gonna almost
have sex with, but I never will.

408
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:55,927
You know?

409
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,146
Yeah, like me and you.

410
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:00,982
- Hey, Deke.
- Hey, Earl.

411
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:03,935
Best conversation I had today.

412
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,906
Max, last night I got the idea
that maybe you thought

413
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,275
that I didn't want to take our
relationship to the next level.

414
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,244
What is this,
"previously on Deke"?

415
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:15,864
And just to prove that I do
want to go to the next level,

416
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,332
I got you a ring.

417
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:21,369
Oh, my God, Max!
I'm so happy for you!

418
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:24,039
Even though I thought I'd be
the first one to get engaged.

419
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,242
I think we all thought that.

420
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:31,213
Deke, I don't know what you're gonna pull
out of your pocket, but it better be a gun.

421
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,381
Actually, I know you don't
want a ring-ring.

422
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:36,468
But how about a NuvaRing?

423
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,553
A NuvaRing?

424
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:41,056
How did you know my size?

425
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,141
I can't wait to try it on.

426
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,977
Well, I am not throwing you
a shower for that.

427
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:50,982
After I saw how you maybe forgot
to take your pill on day one,

428
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:54,152
and then took pills all day
just to be safe,

429
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,787
I thought you'd need a little help.

430
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,623
So there, Max. Will you not
have children with me?

431
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,442
You're damn right I won't.

432
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,962
Oh, wait, I think these
take a couple days to work.

433
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:06,181
Where are we gonna
get a condom for tonight?

434
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:20,845
