1
00:00:01,991 --> 00:00:04,362
All right, I closed out
the cupcake register.

2
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:05,599
Here is our rent money.

3
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:08,297
Give me back the envelope, though,
'cause it's also my jewelry box.

4
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:12,037
No, I closed out the register.
I have our rent money.

5
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:13,855
Max, do you know
what this means?

6
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:16,464
Unless I was hit in the head
by a piece of farm equipment,

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,488
it means we have extra money.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,407
I wanna do
the extra money dance,

9
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,276
but we don't have one because
we've never had extra money!

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,864
The only extra money dance
I know involves ping-pong balls

11
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,348
and I'm really
out of practice.

15
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:41,788
Earl, I brought you
your favorite.

16
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,400
A half-black, half-Chinese
belly dancer?

17
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,017
A coconut cupcake.

18
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,802
Look at Caroline
over there.

19
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:50,554
She's flirting harder
with him

20
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:52,620
than I flirt
with heart disease.

21
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:55,364
Stop, stop! I'm only
on episode two of season one.

22
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,982
I will kill you!

23
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:00,451
Then...
To be continued.

24
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:03,070
Oh! It's gonna be continued...

25
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:05,689
Well, then,
we will continue this...

26
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,576
When we continue this.

27
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,809
If that's your game, you're gonna
be living with me forever, Fran.

28
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,253
He's been in my section three nights
in a row for the Turkey Club.

29
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:20,170
I'm calling him
"the Turkey Club cutie".

30
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:23,207
I'm calling
poison control.

31
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,042
I think he's getting ready
to ask me out.

32
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,699
He wanted to know if I live around
here and what time I get off.

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,780
If a man's gonna wait
for you to get off,

34
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:31,417
he's a keeper.

35
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,269
So...

36
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,404
See you next time.

37
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:39,528
I will see you next time
as well.

38
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,428
Bye.

39
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,495
- What's that?
- I don't know. How would I know?

40
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:53,523
Because it came out
of your head...?

41
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:56,457
I don't have
hair extensions, Max.

42
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,613
- Okay, I'll throw it out.
- No! I'll keep it for this story!

43
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,746
What story?

44
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,598
The story about how we found

45
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,052
a blonde hair extension
out of nowhere that night.

46
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:10,921
It's hilarious!

47
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,456
Well, it's already funnier
than most of your stories.

48
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:18,086
Oh, look, there's another
hilarious story!

49
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,651
Okay, Max, I have
a confession to make.

50
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,369
I have hair extensions.

51
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,604
I also have a confession
to make.

52
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,124
I murdered a man
in Rhode Island.

53
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:33,127
I just have a few.
It gives me volume.

54
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,779
Too bad it doesn't
give you depth.

55
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,799
Now I have to go and try
and reattach these.

56
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,002
These weaves
are supposed to last.

57
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,887
This is unbe-weave-able!

58
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,726
I found this
in the lettuce.

59
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:51,661
Any sign of a NuvaRing in there?
'Cause I can't find mine.

60
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,149
Caroline's losing her hair,
isn't she?

61
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:58,436
Is she sick?
Does she have cancer, <i>The Big "C"?</i>

62
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:01,155
No, <i>Little You</i>.

63
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:05,659
She doesn't have The Big "C".
She barely has the double "A's".

64
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:11,532
- Han found more of your hair.
- He knows about the extensions?

65
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,984
No, he thinks you have cancer.

66
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,894
Oh, good!
So no one knows.

67
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:21,492
Hola, ladies!
Your night just got sexier.

68
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:25,056
Luis, you punched out hours ago.
What are you doing here so late?

69
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:26,640
On your way homo?

70
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:30,518
Good one, hooker!

71
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:34,171
No, I'm between clubs.
Circus just became a straight club,

72
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,441
and Satellite doesn't become
a gay club for a half hour.

73
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:41,011
So... I'm here to have a cocktail
with my bro Oleg.

74
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,514
Luis, we told you.
Oleg is straight.

75
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:47,176
Oh, please!
So am I in Alabama.

76
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:50,905
Well, he left already.

77
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:55,876
But I told him I was gonna stop by.
Typical man. Fear of intimacy.

78
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,212
Oh, Carolina,
while I'm here...

79
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,864
This is yours.
I found it during my shift.

80
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,587
- Ooh, tips from my tables?
- More like hair from your head.

81
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:08,973
I knew this was all too good to be true.
You have extensions.

82
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,914
No, I have cancer.

83
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:23,828
No, you have extensions.
Good try. Later!

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,145
Hey.
Notice anything different?

85
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:37,431
I took some of the extra money
and got new hair extensions.

86
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:41,752
And I also got you a surprise.
I put it in your room. Go look!

87
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:44,139
I'm not interested
unless it's a potbelly pig

88
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,082
or a potbelly pig
in a pilgrim costume,

89
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:49,164
or a pilgrim in a potbelly
pig costume, or just pot.

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,143
Hint, hint. I put it on your bed.
What do you think? Do you love?

91
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,235
Okay...
Why is all this crap on my bed?

92
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,840
- And what the hell is it?
- That's a bed skirt.

93
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,943
My bed doesn't wear skirts.
It's a dude!

94
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,566
I know, because it pokes me
in the back while I'm asleep.

95
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,683
I got you new bedding, and me
some cute new flannel jammies.

96
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,501
They have Eiffel Towers
on them.

97
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:15,185
They were marked down because
everybody hates French people.

98
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,891
These don't even have stains!

99
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,471
How am I gonna know
which is the top now?

100
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:25,114
Max, what's the problem?
You've had those old sheets forever.

101
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:29,018
- You don't even have a spare set.
- A spare set of sheets?

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,520
Who am I,
the Queen of England?

103
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,990
You're so frustrating,
I'd pull my hair out...

104
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:36,542
But I'm not sure
which of it is mine.

105
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,711
Look! Look!
Are you happy?

106
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,797
Chestnut's upset.
He knows we're fighting.

107
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,883
Good! He should know that if
he goes out for a bag of chips,

108
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,553
he could come home to find
you replaced his saddle with a thong.

109
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,540
I got you a present.
Would you be this angry at Santa Claus?

110
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,110
Who's that?

111
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:58,047
Max, please. Just for a change,
try sleeping on something nice.

112
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,482
Fine!

113
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,050
But if I wanted to sleep
on something nice,

114
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:02,702
I would have hooked up
with that guy who moved home

115
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:04,604
to take care
of his sick mother.

116
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,890
Watch your back, Chestnut.

117
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,766
Watch your back.

118
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,900
Where are my old sheets,
bitch?

119
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,669
Why?

120
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,339
Why are you calling me a "bitch"
at night?

121
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,926
I was sleeping
in my new jammies.

122
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,911
Well, I can't sleep
without those sheets.

123
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:31,297
So where are they?
I checked all your drawers.

124
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:35,834
And by the way, who hides
their vibrator in a Starbucks cup?

125
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:39,806
You already know the answer,
so I'm going back to sleep.

126
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:43,109
Whoa, whoa!

127
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,528
Why!

128
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,764
Why am I on the floor
in my new jammies?

129
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,599
Where are they?

130
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,069
I don't have them.
I gave them to the poor.

131
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:55,288
You took them
from the poor!

132
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,540
And the poor
wants them back.

133
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,743
Well, it's too late. I put them
in the Salvation Army donation bin.

134
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:04,597
Well, get up.
You're going to the army, bitch.

135
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,668
Whyyyy?

136
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,287
Why are we here
in the middle of the night?

137
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,523
What are we doing?

138
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,925
Here it is.
Come on, follow me.

139
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,643
Max, is this
where you kill me?

140
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,230
'Cause I always knew it was gonna
happen, I just didn't know when.

141
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,182
This feels right though.

142
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:24,684
I should kill you.

143
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:27,153
Those sheets were
really special to me, okay?

144
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,189
Oh, did you lose
your virginities on them?

145
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:34,477
I don't have sex in beds.
That's where I eat.

146
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,112
Caroline,
I have a confession.

147
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,614
- What is it?
- You have hair extensions.

148
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:41,940
Okay, I'll tell you,
but look away.

149
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,386
It's the pillowcase.
I've had it since I was a kid.

150
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,678
It's like soft and nubby and it had
this edge that I'd like... rub,

151
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,882
and it relaxed me when things
were crappy, which was all the time.

152
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:59,552
I guess I still need that pillowcase
to sleep, or whatever.

153
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:02,544
- Max, that's so sad.
- Of course it's sad!

154
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,924
When has it ever been
a happy tale?

155
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,360
All right,
I need to crawl in here.

156
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,196
Max, y'reouust gonna crawl
into that dirty box?

157
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,648
We don't know where
that bin's been.

158
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,536
By the way, "dirty box" was my
nickname in continuation school.

159
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,906
I need help. Would you rather
I step on your back or your head?

160
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:23,399
My head? Hardly.
Not at these prices.

161
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,563
- Come on, gimme ten fingers.
- I already did.

162
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,338
Behind your back
while we were walking here.

163
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,198
No, like this,
so I can step into it.

164
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,767
- You know, like a finger basket.
- Finger basket...?

165
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,900
Is that another nickname
of yours?

166
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,550
No, but for one summer,
it could've been.

167
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:40,103
Forget this, just let me
pull this stuff over.

168
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:44,420
Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww.

169
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,560
Max, I feel like we're not even
acknowledging our low points anymore.

170
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,646
Okay, Max,
now be very careful.

171
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:52,949
And on the count of...

172
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,285
Wow! You could've been
a great gymnast,

173
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,488
if you'd had money, coaches,
and a breast reduction.

174
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,457
Are you okay?

175
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,242
Max?

176
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,410
Gonna need
some voice contact.

177
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:07,130
I'm not in here alone.

178
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,632
What do you mean
you're not alone?

179
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:19,769
I'm not in here alone.

180
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,282
Stay calm!
I will get you out of there.

181
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:25,691
No, I won't.

182
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,811
I'm looking
for a lever on the inside.

183
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,666
Get outta my house!

184
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:36,335
OK, I just wanna check and see
if you're on my pillowcase.

185
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,987
Max, no!
I need my sweet sheets!

186
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,928
Let it go. If your sheets are under
there, they're no long sweet.

187
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,780
Get outta my house!
And close the door!

188
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:47,632
Okay! Okay!

189
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:51,068
God, Sheez.
You'd think we'd slept together.

190
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,672
What am I gonna do?
I can't sleep without those sheets!

191
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,266
I'm so angry at you!

192
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:59,815
I'd be even angrier if I hadn't
found this great bra.

193
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,964
Why are you going to Sophie's
if you're trying to sleep?

194
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,087
She's the loudest person
we know.

195
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,609
Even black people at the movies
tell Sophie to be quiet.

196
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:15,559
I am going to Sophie's
to get a sleeping pill.

197
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,726
Or as she likes to call them,
"night candy".

198
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,653
You don't need a pill.

199
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,728
Listen, I have a great sleep technique
that my sleep coach taught me.

200
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,702
I have slept with
my fair share of coaches,

201
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,327
and if anything,
they kept me awake.

202
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,329
Max, it's 3:00 A.M.

203
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:30,741
Any normal person
is sleeping right now.

204
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,501
Hi, girls.

205
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,838
Just doing a puzzle
and listening to Elvis.

206
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,092
You two want a Mai Tai
before you get too Ty-Ty?

207
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:45,045
No, thanks,
but speaking of Ty-Ty,

208
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,348
I was hoping I could snag
one of your sleeping pills.

209
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,934
Oh, sure, I can hook you up.
I never use them.

210
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,886
I only need three hours
of sleep at night

211
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:55,823
and six during the day.
Come on.

212
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,193
Sophie...

213
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:01,412
Notice anything new?

214
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:02,863
Oh! Yeah!

215
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:04,748
You planted more hair
on your head.

216
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,500
I heard.

217
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,204
Max! You told her?

218
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:12,072
No, it was on CNN.

219
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:16,176
They led with Syria, and then
did a solid five on your hair.

220
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,578
Here we go...
Pills and spices!

221
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,762
You have a spice rack
full of pills?

222
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,517
You gotta cook me dinner
sometime.

223
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,302
Let's see.

224
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:29,423
Fish oil, penicillin,
amoxicillin...

225
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:32,359
Skittles.

226
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:35,396
Oh, and this is
my German pill

227
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:39,616
in case they release the bombs
or I'm ever abandoned in space.

228
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,871
Here you go, Max.
Nighty-night.

229
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,656
Oh, you know what?

230
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,215
What the hell!
I'm gonna have one two.

231
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:50,748
It's a slumber party!

232
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:53,613
Uh-oh.

233
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:57,334
Oh, now you got another
rack full of pills.

234
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,804
Oh, you know what?

235
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:04,563
Don't wait for me, Max.
This might be a while.

236
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,729
Max, do you really need
to take that?

237
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,098
People do weird things
on sleeping pills.

238
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,486
My friend Candice Travelstead
buttered a wallet and tried to eat it.

239
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:18,138
Don't worry,
I don't have a wallet.

240
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,773
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

241
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:21,475
Is that the sleeping pill,

242
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:25,412
or is that my emergency
space pill that kills you?

243
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,498
Either way,
I'll get some shut-eye.

244
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,421
Max, no! You are not gonna die
and leave me here alone.

245
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:33,709
I still don't know how to go East
on the "L" train without a chaperone.

246
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,874
Max, it's 3:30 A.M.,

247
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:41,676
and sleep coach Caroline here
will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.

248
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,301
You're supposed to be taking
a hot bath.

249
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:47,601
I was, but when I put the stopper in,
something pushed it back out again.

250
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,019
Where's that pill?

251
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,670
I've got it on my person,

252
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,689
and if this doesn't work
I'll give it to you.

253
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,776
Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill.
And don't think I won't.

254
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:58,112
Max, meet your new sheets.

255
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:59,785
New sheets, meet...

256
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,182
Don't make me meet the sheets.
I'm not a mental patient.

257
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:05,235
If I was, I'd be living
in a much nicer place.

258
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,354
And all my pillowcases
would have edges.

259
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,790
Wow, even your pillowcase
had an edge.

260
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,375
What was it like anyway?

261
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:13,494
It was kinda like
the end of your new PJ's,

262
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,630
but not the queerest thing
I've ever seen.

263
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:20,367
A candle?
What are we, witches?

264
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:24,871
Now, imagine yourself
in a relaxed, beautiful place.

265
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:28,258
Breathe in and out.

266
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,561
In and out.

267
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:33,380
Look, if there's one thing
old finger basket know how to do

268
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:35,399
it's in and out.

269
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:37,788
- Gimme the pill.
- I'm not finished yet.

270
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,007
But just so you know,

271
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,488
that pill has changed colors
three times in the last hour.

272
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,965
So it's either deadly,
or an everlasting gobstopper.

273
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:47,528
I am so mad at you.
You took my one thing.

274
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,947
That pillowcase was
my one special thing.

275
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,949
In my whole life of people
taking things away from me,

276
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:53,700
that was the one thing
no one took,

277
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,302
and now I'm never
gonna sleep again.

278
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:56,664
And I love sleeping.

279
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:59,623
Dreaming is the closest thing
I have to cable TV.

280
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,497
Enough, Max!

281
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,378
I've been very patient with
this weird attachment you have

282
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,713
to this little piece of sheet.

283
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,775
You're a <i>piece of sheet</i>.

284
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:13,020
Listen, if I learned anything
when I lost everything,

285
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:14,605
it's that, "A,"
there's no wiggle room

286
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,590
when it comes to cottage cheese
expiration dates,

287
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:20,310
and "B," you can't get
attached to material things.

288
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:22,980
Oh! Okay, <i>Extensions</i>.

289
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,431
What does that mean?

290
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:28,435
It means that your material things
are literally attached to your head.

291
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,769
Not the same thing at all.

292
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,789
Your dependency on that pillowcase
is all in your head, you don't need it.

293
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,825
Oh. You don't need this.

294
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,830
You owe me $14. Ah!

295
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,465
Run a tab.

296
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,391
I'm not about to sit here
and take this abuse

297
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:46,136
because you have an unhealthy
attachment to a pillowcase.

298
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:47,804
Good night, Malibu Barbie.

299
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:51,341
I hope you're not trying to insult me,
because she's gorgeous!

300
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:54,611
And for the record, I do not have
an unhealthy attachment to my hair.

301
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:55,812
Oh, really...?

302
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,550
You're a monster!

303
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:05,322
I'm sorry, I can't sleep.

304
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:08,108
- I'll be fine. Just give me the pill.
- No! It's all in your head!

305
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,444
Go to sleep!

306
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:14,414
I tied the doorknob to my bed with a rope
and locked all the bedroom windows.

307
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,221
Are you trying to hurt me
or turn me on?

308
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,195
Brace yourself, Earl.

309
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,625
When Max gets here, she will
not be in a good mood.

310
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:35,868
Caroline, if I wanted to work around people
in a good mood, I'd go work at Google.

311
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,921
She hasn't slept
since yesterday

312
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,815
and is furious because I won't
give her a sleeping pill.

313
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,296
Smart move. Sleeping pills mess you up.

314
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:45,747
I took one once,

315
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:49,885
woke up a day later on the roller
coaster ride in Coney Island.

316
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,603
I love roller coasters.

317
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,856
Me too,
when I'm in a seat.

318
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:59,144
Oh, hello!
How are you two tonight?

319
00:15:59,146 --> 00:16:01,763
Oh, no. She's nice.
She must've gotten a pill somewhere.

320
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:04,449
No. No pills.
Just had some clarity.

321
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,752
Follow me, please.

322
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:09,821
Oh, okay. Did you smoke
or snort this clarity?

323
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:12,991
Now, since you were nice enough
to get me new sheets,

324
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,577
I got you something in return.
Here.

325
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,947
Oh, is this like an apology,
<i>thank you</i> kind of thing?

326
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:23,051
Now watch. This is how
one graciously accepts a gift.

327
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:26,081
What the hell is this?

328
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,258
A wig?

329
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,729
Either that or you scalped
a lesbian from the '80s.

330
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:37,899
Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie and
climbed up on her shoulder pads.

331
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,768
You took away
my security thing...

332
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,436
The pillowcase...

333
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,855
So now I'm taking away your
security thing... your hair.

334
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,323
You can wear that
on your head tonight

335
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:47,489
and then tell me again
how this is all in my head.

336
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,657
Did you have to get
the ugliest one they had?

337
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:53,077
What do you want
for 37 cents?

338
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,030
Fine! I'll put this roadkill
on my head

339
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,899
just to prove to you that I am
so much more than my hair.

340
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:03,004
I am my attitude, my spirit,
my brain, my bravery.

341
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,922
- Put it on.
- Max, I'm scared.

342
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,675
Go.
The bangs go in the back.

343
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,744
That's my kinda woman.

344
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,681
Cobb salad, pick-up!

345
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:20,137
Uh... hey, Sophie.

346
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,624
Are you here
for the mafia widow discount?

347
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,784
Earl, I'm incognito.

348
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,786
I'm making a drug drop
for Max.

349
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:34,869
Hey, Max!
I got your drugs!

350
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,704
Thanks.

351
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:40,274
And I love that you have an outfit
for everything I ask you to do.

352
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:43,577
Where's the blonde narc,
Max?

353
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,420
Oh, my God!

354
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:56,350
Did Caroline join
a bowling team?

355
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,959
Max! No!

356
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:03,173
Aw, crap! Rod Stewart
just busted us.

357
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:07,134
Let her have some fun.
What's the big deal, square?

358
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,653
The big deal is that Max
thinks she needs these pills

359
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,772
because I threw away
her blankie.

360
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:14,158
It was a pillowcase,
and I need it to sleep.

361
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,027
She has to rub it.

362
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,031
In Poland, I had this little
thing that I liked to tickle

363
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,749
before I went to sleep.

364
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:24,854
But my aunt threw it away.

365
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,420
What was it?

366
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:28,927
My cousin Nora.

367
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,210
Give me the pills.

368
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,680
Nope. And, Max, you were wrong.
See? I'm not attached to my hair.

369
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,695
In fact,
I am loving my new look.

370
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,396
Am I a single mom
trying to keep it simple?

371
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:44,098
Am I an assistant D.A.
in over my head?

372
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,425
Or am I Charlize Theron
in <i>The Jon Bon Jovi Story?</i>

373
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,663
Maybe, and I'm fine with it.
'Cause I am not my hair.

374
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,493
Oh, my God, Turkey Club cutie!
Hide me!

375
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:03,646
On your knees in a bad wig.

376
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,801
Listen, girl,
I've been there.

377
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:07,587
No, I just don't
wanna be seen.

378
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:10,373
Caroline, Caroline, I love you,
but I can't hear anymore.

379
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:13,025
That hair was hard enough
to look at in the '70s.

380
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:18,380
Fine! You were right,
I was wrong.

381
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:21,103
Now help me get this off.
He can't see me like this.

382
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:22,720
That's right,
gimme the pills.

383
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:25,423
Max, no. You don't need them.
We don't know where they've been.

384
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,025
Fine!

385
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:28,643
I'm going home
to try to sleep.

386
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,945
Since this is all your fault,
you can finish my shift.

387
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:35,283
You're on your own, lady who lived
across the street from Al Bundy.

388
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:43,124
I gotta say, I'm pretty
impressed I can do this.

389
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:46,411
It's not so hard. I don't know what
Chanice is always bitching about.

390
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,997
I guess that's who she is.

391
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,666
I can't believe
I still haven't slept.

392
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,551
I'm gonna be awake forever.

393
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:57,038
It's gonna be like that movie
<i>Awakenings,</i> but not at all.

394
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,059
Max, you can rub me.

395
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,146
Wow, that wig changed you.

396
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:06,397
No, here.

397
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:09,484
Rub the edge on the bottom of my
jammie top like it's your pillowcase.

398
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:14,072
No. If I rub the bottom of your
jammies, that would be my bottom.

399
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,857
Turkey Club cutie
didn't ask me out,

400
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,576
probably because my hair
was so messed up from the wig.

401
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:23,081
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It could've been your personality too.

402
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,833
You really think he only
liked you for your hair?

403
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:27,985
I only like me for my hair.

404
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,988
- Told you. You're attached to it.
- So attached to it!

405
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,458
Twirling it, tossing it,
flipping it.

406
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,627
Feeling it on my neck,
on my shoulders, on my back.

407
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:41,382
Caroline Channing without the option of
a sleek updo is not Caroline Channing.

408
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,017
And I'm sorry.

409
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,603
I'm sorry I judged you for having
an attachment to something

410
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:47,171
when I'm no better.

411
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,891
And I'm sorry I got rid
of your sweet sheets.

412
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,893
Max.

413
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:54,195
Max...?

414
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,864
Night, Max.

415
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:06,539
Whyyyy?

416
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,113
Why can't I ever
have anything nice?

417
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,138
