167
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:39,665
(normal voice):
Hospital?

168
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,867
Yes. Let's do it.

169
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:43,335
WOMAN:
<i>Dr. Keller.</i>

170
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,837
'Course I remember him.

171
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,072
Most of these residents
come in cocky,

172
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,574
thinking they know
everything.

173
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,109
Keller wasn't
like that.

174
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,578
You know he lost his
brothers in the towers?

175
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,146
No, we didn't.

176
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,581
Yeah, he was here that day.

177
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,984
Kept waiting for 'em
to be brought in.

178
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,385
Never came to work after that.

179
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,121
That's why he enlisted.

180
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,990
So, you haven't seen him since?

181
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,725
For detectives,
you two don't know very much.

182
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:07,393
No, we know he's
supposedly dead.

183
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:10,597
Supposedly? There's a plaque in
the lobby with his name on it.

184
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,432
You remember anyone
he hung out with,

185
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,368
someone he would've
reached out to?

186
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,139
Keller wasn't
exactly social,

187
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,442
but he did have a roommate.

188
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:29,350
"JT Forbes,
medical researcher."

189
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,889
<i>This is where he lives--</i>
<i>a chemical plant?</i>

190
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,992
Researcher-- maybe
he works from home?

191
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:38,463
Yeah, or it's a meth lab.
Just my type.

192
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:40,700
Oh, a little
Zeke rebound?

193
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:42,469
You can make out in that.

194
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:48,342
This'll be condos
in two years.

195
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:51,278
Guy needs
a new decorator.

196
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,529
JT Forbes?

197
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,699
NYPD.

198
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,736
Mr. Forbes, open up.

199
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,607
(rock music playing
in background)

200
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:19,175
JT Forbes?

201
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:20,710
I'm Detective Chandler.

202
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:22,378
This is Detective Vargas.

203
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,647
Uh, this isn't about that
speeding ticket, is it?

204
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,583
'Cause I'm gonna pay.

205
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,352
No, we're here
to talk to you

206
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,254
about a former roommate,
Vincent Keller?

207
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:32,557
Vincent Keller?

208
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,695
Vincent Keller.

209
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:39,165
It sucks, you know?
What happened.

210
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,533
(turns off music)
So young.

211
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:43,002
So, I'm assuming you haven't
heard from him recently?

212
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:45,204
Like voices or...?
No, like him.

213
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:48,540
His fingerprints just
showed up at a crime scene.

214
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:51,043
Oof. Sounds like you need
new fingerprint guys.

215
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:53,245
Or is there any reason
Mr. Keller might want people

216
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:54,813
to think he's dead?
Maybe he was in trouble...

217
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,282
JT:
He was in Afghanistan.

218
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,050
Of course he
was in trouble.

219
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,352
TESS:
A woman was murdered

220
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:01,654
in the Stanwyck Hotel
last night.

221
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:03,522
Maybe you read about it?

222
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:05,491
Think we could
take a look around?

223
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,527
Uh, listen, I'd love
to help you guys,

224
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:08,728
but I gotta take off.

225
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,564
Bio-chem class to teach.

226
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:16,369
Okay, well, let us know
if you think of anything.

227
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:19,305
Totally.

228
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:21,107
Did you clock the stairs?

229
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,643
Yeah, too bad creepy digs aren't
grounds for a warrant.

230
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,345
But, you know, maybe

231
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:26,546
if you hook up
with him...

232
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:28,815
Or you break
your man cleanse.

233
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:39,726
(footsteps approach)

234
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:40,928
What the hell did you do?

235
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,635
That was her.

236
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,660

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

239
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,528
Do you want a beer?

240
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,430
No, no, I don't
want a beer.

241
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,731
I want you to tell me
what the hell your prints

242
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,200
are doing at
a crime scene.

243
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,468
Look, a woman was in trouble.

244
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,636
Trouble? Trouble,
trouble how?

245
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,804
I mean, did you...?

246
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,472
No, JT, I didn't hurt her.

247
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,908
Well, congratulations
'cause now we've got

248
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,043
<i>her</i> at our door.

249
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,444
Yeah, well, I didn't know

250
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,680
it was going to be
her case, did I?

251
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,615
Her case. Wh-What...

252
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,684
Have you been
keeping tabs on her?

253
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:34,157
Vincent, you
broke every rule:

254
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,592
no interacting with anyone,
no entering a building...

255
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:39,028
Yeah, I know what the rules are,
okay, I made them.

256
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,565
It's been years,
all right?

257
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,967
It starts to feel
like a prison in here.

258
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,969
What prison has a flat screen
and an Xbox?

259
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,504
And if it's so hard

260
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,006
for you, why'd you stop
helping with the antidote?

261
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,541
Yeah, because you know
what the definition

262
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,510
of insanity is, JT?

263
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,012
Doing the same thing
over and over again

264
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,747
and expecting
a different result, okay?

265
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,849
That's why.

266
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,050
All right,
this is it, JT,

267
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,453
this is my life.

268
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,756
Okay.

269
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:09,893
All I'm saying is,
if Catherine Chandler

270
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,695
starts asking
questions,

271
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,531
alerting Muirfield
that you're alive...

272
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,434
we're both
dead men,

273
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,902
and I don't mean "on a
piece of paper" dead.

274
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:23,841
I mean dead
like <i>dead</i> dead.

275
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,981
(siren chirps)

276
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,284
Evan, please tell me
that you have something.

277
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,786
I've got a pair of Louboutins
in an evidence bag.

278
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,820
What size are you?

279
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:37,921
You are so callous.

280
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,956
Okay, so the head wounds
are too superficial

281
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,257
to have killed her,

282
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,059
but she does have signs
of low oxygenation.

283
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,328
Suffocation,
strangulation?

284
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,296
No ligature marks, but
she does have some rash.

285
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,365
Possibly poisoning?

286
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,633
But here's the weird part.
I can't take

287
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,334
much more weird.
Bruised sternum,

288
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,269
cracked ribs.

289
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:54,670
You see that from
CPR sometimes.

290
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:58,674
So, after the killer left,
someone tried to save her?

291
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,009
Why wouldn't they
have stuck around?

292
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:00,843
That's your job.

293
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,579
Oh, I did find a hair.

294
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,579
DNA?

295
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,614
Way to bury the lead.

296
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,083
Um, keep me posted.

297
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,119
Hey, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

298
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,687
I've got premiere tickets.

299
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,456
Free movie, open bar.

300
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,091
What, that flight
attendant on layover?

301
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:16,926
Permanently transferred
to Dallas.

302
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,560
By you or by the airline?

303
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:19,728
Well, it was coming up
to three months.

304
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,597
I may have pulled
some strings.

305
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:24,699
(phone beeping)
Oh.

306
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:25,834
Our vic's husband surfaced.

307
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,035
Always the husband.

308
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:29,037
See, this is why I
stick to three months.

309
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,107
Yeah, well, in this case, our
prime suspect is a dead guy.

310
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,376
I've never seen him before.

311
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:36,812
And you were
at your studio all night?

312
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:37,913
Yes.

313
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:39,448
I'm sorry to have to
ask this, Mr. Webster,

314
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,149
but anyone who
can confirm that?

315
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:44,884
The security guard.

316
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:50,021
Oh, and, uh, I have the proofs
that I was developing.

317
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:54,124
Were you at a club as well?

318
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,693
No.

319
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:57,861
No, I was
at a fund-raiser.

320
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:58,861
I dropped in there

321
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,529
on my way to the office.

322
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:01,931
Did she go with you?

323
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,999
No, no, she had to work.

324
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,767
She just landed
a big promotion.

325
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,635
She started out
as an intern there.

326
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,372
Time-stamped from last night.

327
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,107
Mr. Webster,
that promotion--

328
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:15,376
you think it would have
earned her any enemies?

329
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:19,245
You'd have to ask
her assistant Emily.

330
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:26,819
You have a sleeping bag in there?
I probably should.

331
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,887
It's a 24-7 gig.

332
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,890
I mean, it was.

333
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,626
But, Emily, was anyone jealous
of Ashley's promotion

334
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:37,594
or up for that job, too?

335
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,529
Maybe the beauty editor, but...

336
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,097
The beauty editor?

337
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,665
Chloe London.

338
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,833
She thought that she
deserved the job,

339
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:49,070
but, I'm sorry,
Ashley was the fashion editor.

340
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,438
EVAN:
Cat.

341
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,973
DNA just came in.

342
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,409
Can I talk to
you for a sec?

343
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,944
So who is it--
Vincent Keller?

344
00:14:57,946 --> 00:14:58,911
It's corrupted.

345
00:14:58,913 --> 00:14:59,845
Oh, you're kidding.

346
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,246
Thing is,

347
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,014
you know how you're always
talking about your mum's case?

348
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:04,082
Not always, but...

349
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:05,816
Evan, you're making me nervous.
No, no.

350
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:07,718
I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

351
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,721
The mass spectrometer's
probably just dirty.

352
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:15,392
Cross-species DNA.

TESS:
<i>A little Zeke rebound?</i>

358
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,016
You can make out in that.

359
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,895
(phone ringing)

360
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:56,962
Hey.

361
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:59,565
TESS:
Hey, nice catch with JT's car,

362
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,999
except I just woke up
three of his students.

363
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,767
All confirm he was teaching

364
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,736
Molecular Cellular Methods 2
that night.

365
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,371
Yeah, I'm here.

366
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,040
I don't see you.

367
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,609
Creepy warehouse-- I was up
early, thought I'd check it out.

368
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:13,777
No, that's what
I'm telling you--

369
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,078
there's nothing to check out.

370
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,014
I'll call you later.

371
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,648
Hello?

372
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,984
CATHERINE:
<i>NYPD.</i>

373
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:24,153
I've got a warrant.

374
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,888
Mr. Forbes.

375
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,357
(rustling)

376
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:34,162
Mr. Forbes.

377
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,877
Mr. Forbes?

378
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:56,016
Mr. Forbes.

379
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:59,218
I know you're up here,
I can hear you.

380
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,987
(rustling)

381
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:03,189
VINCENT:
He's teaching class.

382
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,660
I need you
to step out

383
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:09,861
where I can see you.

384
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,962
Sir,

385
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,398
I'm not going to ask you again.

386
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,301
(quietly):
Okay.

387
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:32,013
You're Vincent Keller.

388
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,649
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

389
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,283
I did not kill that woman.
And I didn't mention

390
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:38,551
a murder,

391
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,521
but since you
brought it up...

392
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,224
...why were your prints
at the Webster crime scene?

393
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:47,194
Look, I was out driving.

394
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,129
I saw her collapse.

395
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:50,497
She hit her head,
she needed help.

396
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,733
So you followed her
into the hotel?

397
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,168
I tried
to resuscitate her.

398
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,270
You gave her CPR.

399
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:58,638
You're a doctor.

400
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,306
She had been poisoned.

401
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,674
How would you know that?

402
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:03,243
(phone buzzing)

403
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:04,978
Your phone.

404
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:13,885
Hey,

405
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,221
has tox come back
on the Webster case yet?

406
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:17,689
Our telepathy is working.

407
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:20,124
Positive for lethal doses
of nicotine.

408
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:22,192
Cat,

409
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,360
I just gave you cause of death.

410
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:24,395
Yeah,

411
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,030
that's great.

412
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,565
Okay.
I got to go.

413
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,166
I'll see you at the cinema
at 9:00, yeah?

414
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,167
Yeah, sounds good.

415
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,769
(phone beeps off)

416
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:32,837
How'd you know

417
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,173
she was poisoned
if you didn't kill her?

418
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,210
I have a good
sense of smell.

419
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:40,045
You can smell poison?

420
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,980
Look, I did not
hurt her, okay?

421
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,415
But you were a witness.

422
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,719
Look, I need your help.

423
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:49,288
There was hair found
on the body, matches DNA

424
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,923
from an old murder case.

425
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,391
That night
did you see anything?

426
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:59,399
Why do you have that?

427
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:01,801
I need to know

428
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:02,936
why you have that.

429
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:04,738
I...
TESS: Catherine.

430
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,973
No one can know
I'm here.

431
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,141
Why?

432
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:08,909
Why does everybody need
to think you're dead?

433
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,010
Please,

434
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:12,012
you know I did not
hurt that woman.

435
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,915
TESS:
NYPD.

436
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,784
Please.

437
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,318
We're not done here.

438
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:21,255
NYPD.

439
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,956
Hey.

440
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,157
It's all clear.
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:25,458
You were right,
there's nothing here.

442
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,626
Come on, let's go.

443
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:30,029
Come on.

444
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,965
Hi, this is Detective
Catherine Chandler, NYPD.

445
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,138
I need to speak
to Special Agent Hernandez.

446
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,673
Transferred when?

447
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,642
Joe's waiting for an update.

448
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:52,810
Two minutes.

449
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:56,947
Okay, then who can I speak to

450
00:19:56,949 --> 00:20:00,483
about a case he covered
nine years ago?

451
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:03,253
All right, nicotine, when
ingested, kills in seconds.

452
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,754
Security footage
is longer than that,

453
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,656
so it must have been absorbed
through her skin,

454
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:09,692
in which case it can take
two to four hours to work.

455
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:11,053
So where was she during
that period of time?

456
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:11,725
We checked her date book,

457
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,230
hard drive-- no appointments,
she wasn't at work.

458
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:16,566
Great, great, great,
so we are nowhere.

459
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:18,535
I can't wait to
tell the DA.

460
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:20,571
(distantly):
How's our dead vet fit in?

461
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,807
♪ ♪

462
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,709
(distantly):
Hello.

463
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:26,510
Cat.

464
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:27,778
(normal voice):
Dead vet--

465
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,813
how's he fit in?

466
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:30,314
He doesn't.
Well, you were

467
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,982
suspicious enough
to execute a search.

468
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,017
Dead, not dead--

469
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,518
this isn't an identity case.

470
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,455
We need to focus on finding
the source of the poison.

471
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:38,823
Ashley was
a fashion editor.

472
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:40,658
You want to
kill her,

473
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,495
you probably don't do it
with window cleaner.

474
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:45,330
Then, what do you do it with?

475
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,698
WOMAN:
<i>Do you really think Ashley</i>

476
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,200
was poisoned by something that
came from the beauty closet?

477
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:51,369
Ms. London, we're trying to
figure out what happened,

478
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:52,404
and since you're
the beauty editor...

479
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:54,606
That is a hair product,

480
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:56,474
not a body lotion.

481
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:58,243
Does everyone
get their samples

482
00:20:58,245 --> 00:20:59,411
from the beauty closet?

483
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:00,445
If they're nice to me.

484
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:01,512
They sign them out?

485
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:02,613
And log it.

486
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,515
Do you have any idea
how much these stuff costs?

487
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:06,784
So Ashley Webster being
promoted over you,

488
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:08,085
doesn't sound too nice.

489
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,888
Okay, we're done here.

490
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,190
Ms. London...

491
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:17,628
CHLOE:
I don't mean to be rude,

492
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,530
I have an editorial meeting
that started five minutes ago.

493
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,399
This is Ashley's office.

494
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,468
It's the executive
editor's office.

495
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,403
Oh, so you got that promotion
after all.

496
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:27,504
Not the way I wanted it.

497
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:29,572
Look, I may not
have loved Ashley,

498
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:31,674
but I didn't kill her.

499
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:33,576
(knocking on glass)

500
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:35,979
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have an issue to get out.

501
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:38,915
I trust the two of you
can find your own way out?

502
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,217
Yeah, we sure can.

503
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:46,622
It's Ashley's stuff.

504
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,531
Pregnancy test.

505
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,101
There's two missing.

506
00:21:58,103 --> 00:21:59,469
So Ashley was pregnant?

507
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:01,471
Autopsy wouldn't have caught
it if it was early enough.

508
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,906
Husband didn't seem
like he knew.

509
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:04,374
Maybe it wasn't his.

510
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:06,376
So maybe she was cheating,

511
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:07,644
husband found out?

512
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:09,145
(phone ringing)

513
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:12,949
Chandler.

514
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,718
This is Special Agent
McCleary, FBI.

515
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,019
You called about
a contaminated DNA sample

516
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,488
linked to the murder case
of Vanessa Chandler?

517
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,857
Yeah, I was hoping
we could meet up?

518
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,865
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

519
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:33,470
Detective Chandler.

520
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,938
Agent McCleary.

521
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,840
I appreciate you doing this.

522
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:39,109
Hope it wasn't
too out of your way.

523
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:40,511
Well, I wouldn't want
to be the reason

524
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:41,712
you were late for
your son's birthday.

525
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:42,647
(chuckling)

526
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,081
Did you bring it with you?
I did.

527
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,750
The analysis
looks corrupted,

528
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:47,485
but the numbers
are identical.

529
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,187
Well, we'll take a look.

530
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,599
(blade snicks)

531
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,205
(grunting)

532
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:10,008
(Catherine cries out)

533
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:14,312
(yelling)

534
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,718
(man cries out)

535
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:37,067
(music playing through earbuds):
♪ Just call me angel ♪

536
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:39,670
♪ Ah, ah ♪

537
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:44,842
♪ Just touch my cheek
before you leave me... ♪

538
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:50,081
(both groaning)

539
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,253
(grunting)

540
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:12,104
(yelling)

541
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:17,910
(pained grunt)

542
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:26,152
(growling, Catherine gasps)

543
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:27,620
(blows landing, grunting)

544
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:29,856
(grunting)

545
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:32,192
(man screaming)

546
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:47,039
(gun clatters)

547
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:56,214
Hey!

548
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:59,217
Hey, I know you're down here!

549
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,119
Come out, come out!

550
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,654
Hey!

551
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,189
Come out here!

552
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:07,126
I know you're here!
I know you can see me!

553
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:08,560
(horn sounding)

554
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:12,331
(horn blaring)

555
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:38,456
You're him.

556
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:48,173
So, are we gonna
talk about it?

557
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:49,920
You need to keep
this clean and dry.

558
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,489
Avoidance.

559
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:54,592
One of my favorite techniques.

560
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,027
How about a drink?

561
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:57,629
Can you drink?

562
00:25:57,631 --> 00:25:58,863
Not such a good idea.

563
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:01,032
Maybe not for you.

564
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:02,300
Look, my roommate is home...

565
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:04,969
Hey, I-I-I promise
that I will be quiet.

566
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,337
It's just...

567
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,375
three people did just try
to kill me, and, uh...

568
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:12,477
you killed two of them.

569
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:19,619
I think we got beer.

570
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,021
Great.

571
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:37,903
It's just a hobby.

572
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:40,039
Here.

573
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,108
Um, yeah, my mom, she...

574
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,010
she used to have this
stuff lying around, too.

575
00:26:45,012 --> 00:26:46,979
She's the one,

576
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,714
nine years ago.

577
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:52,117
So, um,

578
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,621
what happened to you?

579
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:02,896
Did someone do this to you?

580
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:05,532
(faint voices echoing)

581
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:12,740
I should've asked questions.

582
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:15,576
(faint voices echoing)

583
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:18,878
Any word
from your brothers?

584
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,247
They're still trying
to get everyone out.

585
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:23,883
(echoes): <i>They're still trying</i>
<i>to get everyone out.</i>

586
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,485
But I was too angry.

587
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:28,020
<i>Confused.</i>

588
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,555
So you enlisted.

589
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:31,623
Yeah.

590
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,758
(closing door echoes)

591
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,092
<i>Once I got over there,</i>

592
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,293
I was tapped.

593
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:37,495
<i>They told me</i>
<i>that I had the chance</i>

594
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:38,663
<i>to be part of something great,</i>

595
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:40,933
that I could make
a difference.

596
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:43,569
It was called
Operation Muirfield.

597
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:56,615
<i>They told us they were</i>
<i>vitamins, antibiotics,</i>

598
00:27:56,617 --> 00:27:58,650
steroids that would protect us.

599
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,719
What were they?

600
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,121
Like I said,
I should've asked questions.

601
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:04,590
All I know is that
they changed our DNA.

602
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:07,092
(automatic gunfire)
<i>They made us stronger,</i>

603
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:10,795
faster... better.

604
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:14,265
They heightened our
reflexes, our senses.

605
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:15,834
That's why you could
smell the poison.

606
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:17,135
Yeah.

607
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,904
But something went wrong.

608
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:23,142
<i>Anytime the adrenaline kicked</i>
<i>in, we became monsters.</i>

609
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:24,843
<i>They couldn't stop us.</i>

610
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:27,847
We couldn't stop us.

611
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:29,782
So they gave orders
to shut it down,

612
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:31,183
to eradicate us all.

613
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:33,085
(chopper blades whirring)

614
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,820
(men shouting)

615
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,989
(explosion)

616
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:38,924
How did you survive?

617
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:41,860
Luck.

618
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,128
(wry laugh)

619
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:47,266
So... all of this...

620
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,135
for an antidote.

621
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:51,605
It doesn't work.

622
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,507
You've just been
hiding out here?

623
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,910
Yeah.

624
00:28:56,912 --> 00:29:00,146
JT's the only one I can trust.

625
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,816
Except you, you go out there
and you save people.

626
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:04,851
No.
No...

627
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:06,953
you do.

628
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,825
You saved me,

629
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:14,762
and you tried to save
Ashley Webster.

630
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:20,935
I guess it reminds me
of who I used to be.

631
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:23,271
A doctor?

632
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,677
Human.

633
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:49,765
You should probably
leave now.

634
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:53,134
Vincent, that night
nine years ago,

635
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:56,103
why were you there...
I already told you more than I should.

636
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:58,039
That agent on
the platform

637
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,206
was from Muirfield, okay?

638
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,841
You're on their radar.
Why?

639
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,910
Vincent, does this have
something to do with my mom?

640
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:06,046
I don't know anything
about your mom.

641
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:09,915
I'm sorry, okay?

642
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,816
But you can not come back here.

643
00:30:11,818 --> 00:30:13,785
It is too dangerous
for the both of us.

644
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,053
No, I just...
Just go.

645
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:23,362
Go.

646
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,577
TESS: There you are.
I've been calling

647
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,412
and calling you.

648
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:53,115
Were you with Zeke?

649
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,917
What?
That glow.

650
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,085
What glow?

651
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,987
The sex glow.
It's all over your face.

652
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,355
I don't have a glow.

653
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,290
I'm just excited.

654
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,059
I found the murder weapon.

655
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,195
Evan said he went
through everything.

656
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,963
It's what's not here
that's important.

657
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,265
Look, the sign-out sheet.

658
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,666
Ashley signed out

659
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,435
four products
the day before she died.

660
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,137
Our guys only found three.

661
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,238
Killer probably took
the fourth.

662
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,041
So someone put poison
in Ashley's

663
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,244
True to Color Blonde?

664
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,812
CATHERINE:
Hey, Evan,

665
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,314
any way to tell
if that nicotine

666
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,049
was absorbed through
Taylor's scalp?

667
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,784
I'll check her hair follicles.

668
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,419
You do realize that I waited
for hours and hours last night?

669
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,154
This one
stood me up.

670
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,422
Oh, my God,
the premiere.

671
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,092
Movie was lousy.
Good swag bag.

672
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,761
Then I got called into here.

673
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,863
My guys found these
in the power couple's bed.

674
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,098
Oh. Bedbugs?

675
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,133
That rash I showed you
was actually bites.

676
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,202
Since these things
are little bloodsuckers,

677
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,904
they carry the DNA

678
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,738
of whoever's been rolling around
in those sheets.

679
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,140
Your vic wasn't
pregnant.

680
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,309
It was the hubby
that was stepping out.

681
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,878
Can those mini vampires
tell us who with?

682
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,647
Sorry, ladies,
we're not open yet.

683
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,149
Actually, I'm
Detective Chandler,

684
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:00,117
and this is
Detective Vargas.

685
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,120
TESS: Alex's proofs from the
night his wife died--

686
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,321
that was you.

687
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:04,922
You were having
an affair with him.

688
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,061
Alex told me
not to say anything.

689
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,397
He said it would just make me
look guilty,

690
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,133
especially 'cause
of the prenup.

691
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:15,367
What prenup?

692
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,835
If he cheats,

693
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:18,937
he loses everything.

694
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,405
But I didn't kill her, I swear.

695
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,441
CATHERINE:
<i>It's not just this hostess.</i>

696
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:24,777
We have bedbug DNA...
Hey!

697
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,779
...from four other women.
I'm eating here!

698
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,514
Alex Webster had
access to the poison,

699
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:30,950
and he had motive-- the prenup.

700
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:32,118
Except there was no prenup.

701
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,022
I just read the forensic
accounting report.

702
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:38,659
If he wanted out, all he had
to do was file for divorce.

703
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:41,095
Now, if you will excuse me,

704
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:43,297
I have some FBI nonsense
to deal with.

705
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:46,500
(clears throat)

706
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:48,002
Sir.

707
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:50,171
What's going on?

708
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:51,305
I don't know.

709
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:52,973
Bodies from the subway.

710
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:55,442
VINCENT: <i>The agents</i>
<i>on the platform were</i>

711
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:56,977
from Muirfield. You
are on their radar.

712
00:32:56,979 --> 00:33:00,181
<i>It is too dangerous</i>
<i>for the both of us.</i>

713
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:12,661
Don't see you guys
out here very often.

714
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:14,196
What's the occasion?

715
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:16,531
Just following orders,
Detective.

716
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,406
Of course, we're gonna
need to take that back.

717
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:26,744
Of course. Just making sure
you're not stealing our case.

718
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:34,653
Detective Chandler.

719
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,938
VINCENT:
Hey.

720
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,173
(gasps)
Oh, my God, you scared me.

721
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:57,376
You're the one snooping
around my place.

722
00:33:57,378 --> 00:33:59,377
Hey, some military guys
just showed up.

723
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:01,413
They took the agents
from the platform away.

724
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,315
You didn't talk to them, did you?
No. I asked them

725
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:04,916
what they were doing,
and I came straight here.

726
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,518
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have done that.

727
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,154
I wasn't followed.
I needed to warn you.

728
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:09,288
Look, you need to leave.

729
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,457
No. Listen to me. Look,

730
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:12,892
I lost my phone
on the platform.

731
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:14,060
What if the Muirfield people

732
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:15,862
have it, and they know
about you?

733
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:18,131
This is why you have to
stop all contact with me.

734
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,032
What about my mom?
I know what it's like

735
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:22,368
to lose someone you love,
but you need to move on.

736
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,170
You can't tell me
to just move on!

737
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:25,605
Well, so what? You'll solve
your mother's murder,

738
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,575
exact justice? Trust me,
it does not end well.

739
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,043
Well, I'm gonna
take my chances.

740
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:32,045
You don't get it, do you?!
No, I do!

741
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:35,115
You can't tell me everything,
and that's fine.

742
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:37,218
I don't need all the answers,
but last night--

743
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,520
that was the first time
since my mom died

744
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,421
that I haven't felt crazy.

745
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:42,789
(inhales deeply)

746
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:48,228
You are crazy
showing up here alone!

747
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,531
I could kill you in less
than a second! Now go!

748
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,534
(roars):
Go!

749
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,537
(panting)

750
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,237
CATHERINE: <i>Last night,</i>
<i>I realized that I was</i>

751
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,974
thinking about your
wife's case the wrong way.

752
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:14,484
Sometimes things
aren't what they seem.

753
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:17,096
You can't tell
who the real monsters are.

754
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:18,196
I didn't kill my wife.

755
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,999
We just spoke
to a woman

756
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,299
you're having an affair with,

757
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,869
and I have DNA
that proves

758
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,737
there are at least four others.

759
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:28,707
You made every

760
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,042
one of your women
fall in love with you

761
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,644
and think that the only thing
standing in the way

762
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:37,414
of their fairy tale ending
was some pretend prenup.

763
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,217
Mr. Webster,

764
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,552
I don't think
you killed your wife.

765
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:47,456
But you are the reason
she's dead.

766
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,161
I need a list of names.

767
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:56,265
Everyone you slept with
during your marriage.

768
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,434
You owe it to Ashley.

769
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,110
Hey.

770
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,145
Are you looking for Chloe?

771
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,379
I'm her new assistant.

772
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,882
Actually, Emily, uh,
we want to talk to you.

773
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,718
CATHERINE: Look, we appreciate how
helpful you've been, but

774
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,854
you forgot
to mention one thing.

775
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,322
Alex.

776
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:21,290
Alex?

777
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:24,226
Alex Webster-- you were having
an affair with him.

778
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:26,895
TESS: The missing pregnancy
tests-- we assumed

779
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:28,898
they were Ashley's, but
you used them, didn't you?

780
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,800
That's why you had
saltines in your purse.

781
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:33,436
I don't know
what you're...

782
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:34,870
The sign-out sheet.

783
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:36,372
I'm pretty sure
if we showed this

784
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,906
to an expert,
they'd confirm that

785
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:40,976
this was you signing out
Ashley's True to Color Blond.

786
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,411
No. Uh, Chloe ran the closet...

787
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,247
You wanted us to
think it was her

788
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:47,083
so that you could run off
into the sunset with Alex.

789
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,120
But there was no prenup.

790
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:52,189
That's impossible.

791
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:53,724
He lied. Just
like he lied

792
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:55,926
to all his women,
including the one

793
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:58,395
that he was with the night
that you killed Ashley.

794
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,838
I'm not even pregnant anymore.

795
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,773
I lost it.

796
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:10,241
You tell us where
the bottle is,

797
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,510
we'll make sure that the DA
knows how remorseful you are.

798
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:31,997
(distant siren wailing)

799
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,998
Are we okay?

800
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,234
You've been having
secret conversations,

801
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:38,502
you executed that search
without me,

802
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:40,971
and my brother's investigating
the subway case...

803
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:43,507
he found this
on the platform.

804
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:45,675
What were you doing
on the F train?

805
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:52,415
All right, just forget it.

806
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,251
Just know I'm here,
no judgments,

807
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:55,352
you ever want to talk.

808
00:37:55,354 --> 00:37:58,188
Hey, it's Devil and Prada.
Nice work.

809
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,190
Hey, as long
as I get to be Devil.

810
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,993
So I'm not letting you
celebrate your big case

811
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:04,595
alone at your father's
engagement party.

812
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,030
What's the dress code?

813
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:07,398
Evan, you don't have
to do that.

814
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,100
Oh, come on. Free
drinks, and I'm assuming

815
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:11,569
your vapid stepmother
insisted on a good caterer.

816
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,104
You're just doing
this out of...

817
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:15,239
Charity. Yeah,
poor little single girl.

818
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:17,208
Did Tess tell you about Zeke?

819
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,310
No, Joe did.

820
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:21,045
How does Joe know?
(laughs) I don't know.

821
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:22,180
But I wouldn't ask him now.

822
00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:23,481
He's just found out

823
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:24,983
the department has to shell
out for a new spectrometer.

824
00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:28,487
Yeah, I took a look
over some old cases.

825
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:31,489
Six more samples,

826
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:33,825
all with the same
corrupted DNA.

827
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:36,028
Six. Really?

828
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,030
Yeah, so I guess
we'll see what's what

829
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:39,565
once we get our
new spectrometer.

830
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,602
Maybe you weren't
so crazy after all.

831
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:56,216
Right there.
What are you gonna do?

832
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,521
Check.

833
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:02,656
(footsteps approaching)

834
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,260
Hi.

835
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,097
Hi.

836
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,266
Hi?

837
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,135
H-Hi?

838
00:39:14,137 --> 00:39:16,237
Did I miss something,

839
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,372
or...?
JT, you mind?

840
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,982
Wow.

841
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:30,617
Just, you look...

842
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,653
I have an engagement party.

843
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:34,355
Right.

844
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:38,292
Look, I know you're gonna
try to kick me out. I get it.

845
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,129
I-I get what it's
like to hide out

846
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:44,666
and push people away 'cause
you don't feel deserving.

847
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:50,572
Do you know why I keep
asking about my mom?

848
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:54,176
Because I'm the reason
that she's dead.

849
00:39:56,113 --> 00:40:00,683
If I hadn't left the stupid
vanity mirror open...

850
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:05,154
But, Vincent,
I just found

851
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,223
six cases of you

852
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:09,626
trying to save victims
around the city.

853
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:13,296
You're not a monster.

854
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,366
I would know.

855
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:19,636
There are a lot of guys
out there that are, but...

856
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:24,408
You saved my life.

857
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,611
Twice.

858
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:30,782
Catherine, wait.

859
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:33,251
You're not the reason
your mom's dead.

860
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:36,087
They were tracking her.

861
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:39,725
I'm not sure why,
but it wasn't your fault.

862
00:40:41,194 --> 00:40:43,662
(gasps)

863
