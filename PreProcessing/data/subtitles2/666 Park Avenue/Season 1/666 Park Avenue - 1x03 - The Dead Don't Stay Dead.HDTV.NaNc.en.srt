1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,828
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:04,665
Nice digs.

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:07,033
We have an interview...
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.

4
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:08,361
For the manager position.

5
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,801
I want the Drake restored
to its original glory,

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,818
and I want you to do it.

7
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,435
She's how we get Henry.

8
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:15,340
Someone covered up a door right here.

9
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,985
Whoever covered this door with concrete

10
00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:18,379
might've had a good reason to do it.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,311
I still want you to demo that wall.

12
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,344
You need to leave.

13
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,189
It's the price we pay...

14
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,702
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane.

15
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:27,168
For the thing we want the most.

16
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:29,191
Somebody?

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,158
Oh, God.

18
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,200
Come on!

19
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:39,758
Damn it!

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,397
Let us out.

21
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:07,351
Hello?! Can somebody hear me?!

22
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:09,519
Help!

23
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:13,987
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't die.

24
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:16,567
Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die.

25
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,133
Hello?!

26
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,575
Can anybody hear me?!

27
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:33,709
Is somebody in here?

28
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,086
Go.

29
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:39,771
Go away.

30
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:41,288
Who is that?

31
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,117
Damn it.

32
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:46,888
Hello?

33
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:47,914
- Henry! Henry!
- Jane! There you are!

34
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:49,814
I've been looking all over for you.

35
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,098
Henry, there's somebody in there. Okay?

36
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:52,650
- What?
- A little girl. She grabbed my leg.

37
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,319
- In there?
- Yes!

38
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,812
- Come on. You okay?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:59,389
- Be careful.
- Hello?

40
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:02,508
Hello? Is anyone in here?

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,869
Hello?

42
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:09,329
Baby, there's nobody in here.

43
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,156
Are you sure it wasn't one of the dolls?

44
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:14,035
No! I-I know what I saw, Henry.

45
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,666
H-her voice. I heard her voice.

46
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:23,697
Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

47
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:26,873
I bet you can hear things
through this air vent.

48
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,936
It's okay.

49
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,073
Oh, my God. It felt so real.

50
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,243
I was so scared.

51
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,645
You're okay. All right? You're okay.

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,078
Why don't we go upstairs... listen...

53
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,236
where it's warm and cozy,

54
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,737
and the only person who'll
be grabbing you is me?

55
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,197
All right?

56
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,802
You're okay, baby.

57
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,449
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

58
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,657
Do you think I'm crazy?

59
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,163
Yeah.

61
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:43,232
Do you have any idea how
sick I am of dead people?

62
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,497
Well, at least the job's half done.

63
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:46,729
Their story's already been told.

64
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,905
All you have to do is type it up.

65
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,205
That is the point.

66
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:52,040
There's no challenge in writing obituaries.

67
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,584
You know, they're... they're
like classifieds for the dead.

68
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,099
You know, every time I see you, Annie,

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,673
you say the same thing.

70
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,931
So tell me, what do you want to write?

71
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:04,680
Stories that matter,
that have consequences.

72
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,888
I mean, I went to school
to be a real journalist.

73
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,911
My mom toiled at children's
stories for 20 years.

74
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:14,241
Yeah, she never published, but...

75
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,279
At least she wrote from the heart.

76
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,246
Oh! I meant to ask about Louise.

77
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,487
How's she feeling?

78
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,746
Great. It's amazing, actually.

79
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:25,092
One good night of rest back at the Drake,

80
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:26,718
and it's like all of her pain went away.

81
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,168
Good. I was worried about her.

82
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,126
Uh, you think it'll be okay if
I stop by later and say hi?

83
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,505
Yeah, yeah. She'd love to see you.

84
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,238
Great. See ya.

85
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:46,822
Annie.

86
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,104
How is life out on the beat?

87
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:52,808
Wouldn't know. None of
my subjects have pulses.

88
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,272
That sounds like the gallows
humor of an obituary writer.

89
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:58,508
And I thought I'd lost my sense of humor.

90
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,459
Going that well?

91
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,515
Honestly, Gavin, I would do anything

92
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:02,998
to get off the obit desk.

93
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,239
But you're very funny and creative.

94
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,709
Well, you should tap into that.

95
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,455
Those are two qualities not
encouraged in my line of work.

96
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:13,307
Well, maybe I can do something to help.

97
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,884
Tap into my creativity, huh, Gavin?

98

I-I zoned. I'm sorry.

Yeah, that was the idea.

00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,861
Can you imagine the
secrets buried in there?

137
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:40,572
The architect totally missed the room

138
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,452
even though he mapped out
all of the duct work

139
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:43,167
that went through there.

140

Come see this.

141
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,266
I suppose that means you
want me to walk over there?

Well, if you wanna pretend
you're interested,

143
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,081
it will help sell it.

144
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,165
See this duct work?

145
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,762
It was probably used for
an air conditioning unit.

146
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:00,555
But a/c wasn't readily
available until the 1950s,

147
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:01,527
which means that this si...

148
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,432
Someone did a renovation.

149
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,597
Right? 'Cause if the Drake
wasn't built till '23,

then... what? I've been paying attention.

I'm very impressed.

152
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:10,836
I'm gonna talk to Gavin to see

153
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,560
if he knows where the original plans are.

154
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,771
Time out. Hold on. Hold on.

155
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,367
Hey, you know, maybe somebody
built that wall for a reason.

156
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:18,008
- Okay. What reason?
- I don't know.

157
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,010
'Cause it was personal?

158
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,932
'Cause maybe he wanted it
to stay hidden 'cause...

159
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,893
Maybe it's haunted?

160
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:25,130
All right you making fun of me? Yes.

161
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,972
Look, babe, everything is
going great here. All right?

162
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,938
Gavin's taking me to his club today...

163
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,712
Yes, Henry. Everything
is going great for you.

164
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,834
And it's a very highly respected club,

165
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:32,775
and there's nothing wrong

166
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:36,041
with seeing how the high
and mighty live. Okay?

167
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,136
Jane, all I'm saying is,

168
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:41,263
maybe it isn't the best idea to
tell our landlord... your boss...

169
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:43,483
that you're hammering down
walls without his permission.

170
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,037
But I do have permission.

171
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:47,590
He told me to restore the
Drake to its original design,

172
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,537
and that is what I'm doing.

173
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,396
Henry, the Drake is one big puzzle box.

174
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,715
Okay, I wanna uncover
every hidden treasure,

175
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,071
every mystery in this place.

176
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:58,733
If you were the owner,
wouldn't you want to know?

177
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:09,620
Good morning, Jane.

178
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:10,997
Morning, Gavin.

179
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:14,128
I, uh, I noticed the orchids
throughout the building.

180
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,484
Special occasion for you and Olivia?

181
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:18,121
It's a memorial.

182
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:21,264
Our daughter passed away
ten years ago today.

183
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:25,361
Oh, Gavin, I-I'm so sorry. I...

184
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:26,818
I had no idea.

185
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:28,243
How would you?

186
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,209
Now to what do I owe the pleasure?

187
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:33,863
It's not important. I can
come back another time.

188
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,008
What happened to our
daughter's in the past, Jane.

189
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,254
I'd prefer to focus on the future.

190
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:40,222
Are those blueprints?

191
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:41,922
Uh, yes.

192
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,083
Well, as you know, uh,

193
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,469
while preparing the Barlows'
apartment for rent,

194
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,689
I stumbled across a bird infestation.

195
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,266
Uh, that led to the basement,

196
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:55,251
which led to our exterminator
sledgehammering down a wall.

197
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,298
Carefully.

198
00:09:57,482 --> 00:10:02,192
And that led to the discovery
of a hidden storage room.

199
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,111
And?

200
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,320
Well, uh...

201
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:10,221
I was wondering if you had
the original building plans,

202
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:12,870
so I could continue looking around.

203
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:17,694
What is it that you're hoping to find?

204
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,140
Well, I-I don't know.

205
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,409
Maybe the reason why someone wanted to bury

206
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,523
the history of the Drake.

207
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,960
That's a good idea, Jane.

208
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:40,437
Maybe I have those old blueprints.

209
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,272
Let me look for them.

210
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,908
In the meantime,

211
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,009
maybe you could do something for me.

212
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,578
Um, of course. Anything.

213
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,920
This day's always emotional for Olivia.

214
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:52,344
Um, I would appreciate it if
you could keep an eye on her.

215
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:53,837
She's clearly taken to you.

216
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:56,156
Well, uh, Gavin, I-I
would be happy to help,

217
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,984
but I'm not sure she would want me around.

218
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:00,425
Well, she does prefer to be on her own,

219
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,907
but she can get a little...

220
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:05,965
Let's just say destructive.

221
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,719
We all have our own ways
of dealing with loss.

222
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,471
What do you mean by "destructive"?

223
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,210
Ahh. Hello, darling.

224
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,962
Hello! Mwah. Mmm.

225
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,285
Jane, how are you?

226
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm... I'm very well. Uh,

227
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:21,284
Olivia, I was wondering if
you were free for lunch.

228
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:24,620
Oh. That's... a wonderful idea.

229
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,613
I'll meet you downstairs in an hour,

230
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:29,025
give you a chance to change your clothes.

231
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,666
I really wish I had taken the subway.

232
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,119
Excuse me, sir. Can we go any faster?

233
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,395
All of Lexington is shut down for a funeral.
Some diplomat's.

234
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:49,467
For the funeral of Oscar Diebold,

235
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:52,274
a CIA agent and Cold War hero

236
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:54,277
♪♪

237
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,544
who died yesterday at his home in Queens.

238
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,751
Diebold was recruited by the CIA

239
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,137
♪♪

240
00:11:56,752 --> 00:12:00,187
and became one of the agency's
most respected operatives.

241
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:01,532
- CIA director...
- Oh, my God.

242
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,840
- And federal judge Lawrence Wilkins says...
- Oh, my God.

243
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:07,837
He has nothing but respect for Diebold.
He was the kind of...

244
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,499
Gavin, I need to talk to you!

245
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,324
Late for an appointment, Annie.

246
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:13,478
Great piece this morning.

247
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,941
But that story I wrote, it isn't true.

248
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:17,511
Well, of course it is. I
read it in the paper.

249
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,979
No, G-Gavin, I made it up.

250
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,773
Now, Annie, that man who
died was an American hero.

251
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:31,478
You want to take that away from him?

252
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,554
From you?

253
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,341
No. No.

254
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,344
I got a good feeling, Annie.

255
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:45,779
Things are gonna turn around for you.

256
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,437
What is it you want, Henry?

257
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:12,149
Right now? Some water.

258
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:15,021
When someone asks about your future,

259
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:18,567
if it's a joke to you, it's a joke to them.

260
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:26,030
I wanna marry Jane.

261
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:28,554
I'll wager that'll happen fairly soon.

262
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:32,083
But the next time someone
who's fairly connected

263
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:35,067
asks what you want, my
unsolicited advice is,

264
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:37,238
don't lead with your love life.

265
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,022
Aim higher.

266
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,732
I wanna be Bill Edwards' chief of staff.

267
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,067
Well, that's certainly more specific.

268
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,274
He's a city councilman

269
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,796
to the fifth Brooklyn district, right?

270
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:51,011
Greenpoint.

271
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,032
And I heard he's gonna take a shot

272
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,684
at the mayor's office next election.

273
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:54,981
You already work for the mayor.

274
00:13:54,982 --> 00:13:56,475
In city planning.

275
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:59,328
I wasn't dreaming of city
planning when I was a kid.

276
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,336
So what was the kid's the dream?

277
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,188
Be chief of staff to a city councilman?

278
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,053
It's a step in the right direction.

279
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,560
Actually, I have an
interview in four weeks.

280
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:08,391
The job will be gone in four weeks.

281
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:09,568
You wanna make it in this town, Henry?

282
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:12,893
You don't wait in line for your turn.
There's no line.

283
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,181
You gotta take what you want.

284
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,741
You know, I-I think Henry always
wanted to live in New York.

285
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:28,344
He kind of harbors secret
political ambitions, though...

286
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,507
He'd never admit it.

287
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,485
So you moved here for him?

288
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:32,729
Well, for us.

289
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,678
You know, my degree is in architecture

290
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,742
but my heart is in historic preservation,

291
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,978
and this city offers us everything.

292
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,641
This restaurant is lovely.

293
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:46,476
Ahh. I used to take Sasha here
when she was a little girl.

294
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:50,200
She'd get all dressed up in a smart suit,

295
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:53,351
order a milkshake in a Martini glass...

296
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,456
And tell me which men

297
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,829
she thought were good enough to marry.

298
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,686
Marry? Really? How old was she?

299
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:00,176
7.

300
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,061
"Precocious" doesn't quite do her justice.

301
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,245
I'm sure you miss her very much.

302
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,316
Ah.

303
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:11,063
Thank you. Thanks.

304
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,743
So you two seem to be getting along well.

305
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:17,865
How's the sex with Henry?

306
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:24,266
It's, uh, it's...

307
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:25,848
Very nice.

308
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,520
"Very nice" isn't always very nice.

309
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,371
It's, uh, it's...

310
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,193
Healthy.

311
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:34,964
Our entire relationship.

312
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:37,065
Well, except...

313
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,375
Right now, he might think
I'm a little crazy.

314
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,576
Oh. That sounds juicy.

315
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:43,431
Do tell.

316
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:46,236
It... it's nothing. Uh, a misunderstanding.

317
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,569
I don't want you thinking I'm crazy, too.

318
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:50,639
Try me.

319
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,625
Well, um...

320
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,012
Since we moved into the Drake,

321
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,983
I've been having these vivid dreams.

322
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:02,123
Nightmares?

323
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,466
No, more like visions.

324
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:09,554
I'm... I'm not sure what's real.

325
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,799
See, now you're looking
at me that way, too.

326
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,096
Oh.

327
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:16,223
I'm not.

328
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:18,714
Just...

329
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:21,156
I get the feeling like, uh...

330
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,921
The dead won't stay dead.

331
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,169
Oh, Olivia, I'm so sorry.

332
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,663
That was insensitive. I didn't mean Sasha.

333
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,556
I..

334
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,645
Oh. Please. It happened a lot time ago.

335
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,728
Jeffrey, another.

336
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,715
Great piece last night, Annie.

337
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,714
Oh. Thanks.

338
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,776
And that Kandinsky? So creepy.

339
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:56,296
Yeah. It just... really kinda wrote itself.

340
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:58,798
It's a shame your mom
isn't around to see it.

341
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,149
She'd be so proud of you.

342
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:02,972
Yeah.

343
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:20,984
Hey, Jim, it's Annie in obits.

344
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:24,414
I... yeah, I need to
print a small retraction

345
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,619
to a piece I wrote last month.

346
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,306
Great. I'll send it over in a minute.
Thanks.

347
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,400
I love you, Mom.

348
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:07,494
Oh, my God.

349
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,688
Oh, my God.

350
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,700
What is happened to me?

351
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,381
Anything catch your eye?

352
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,955
Uh, it all looks good.

353
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,746
Off menu.

354
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,484
First deputy mayor over my shoulder,

355
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,395
D.A.'s just over there,

356
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,699
and unless I'm mistaken,

357
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,253
that is...

358
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,621
That's councilman Edwards.

359
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:39,588
Imagine your luck.

360
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,693
What do you intend to do about it?

361
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,759
U-uh... I don't know.

362
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,192
I mean, I-I don't want to bother him.

363
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,145
Are you rich, Henry?

364
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,630
You got an uncle

365
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,339
who's gonna leave you a nice nest egg?

366
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:54,922
No.

367
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,887
You and I are the same, you know?

368
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:01,736
We come from nothing.

369
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,915
We have to fight and claw

370
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,651
to get what we want in this world.

371
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:12,103
You like this club?

372
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,657
Only way you'll ever come
back here is as a guest,

373
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,064
someone throws you a bone.

374
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:19,769
Is that how you wanna live your life?

375
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:27,990
Henry.

376
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,215
Don't come back without the job.

377
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:42,233
Excuse me, Mr. Edwards, I just
wanted to introduce myself.

378
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:43,391
My name is, uh, Henry Martin.

379
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,809
Uh, we have an interview
set up in a few weeks

380
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,102
for the chief of staff position.

381
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:52,521
Great. Guess I'll see you
in a few weeks then, huh?

382
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:04,722
I just wanna tell you

383
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,559
you're gonna lose this
upcoming election, sir.

384
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,066
How's that?

385
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:11,308
Because voters are mad

386
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,222
about the rezoning in the
Greenpoint district.

387
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,264
They think you're in the
developer's pocket.

388
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:16,839
Meanwhile, the developers
think you're too tough

389
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,152
on environmental regulations.

390
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:20,469
You wanna make a run at mayor someday?

391
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,323
If you're not careful, Mr. Edwards,

392
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,602
you're gonna be unemployed in six months.

393
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,211
Why don't you have a seat?

394
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:35,622
Thank you.

395
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,340
Hey, uh, Tommy? Get him a drink, would you?

396
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:39,923
What was your name?

397
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,373
- Henry Martin. 
- Henry.

398
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,988
Maybe you... you wanna slow down.

399
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:49,888
Live a little, Jane.

400
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,449
Olivia, why don't I drive?

401
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,083
Why don't you just sit
back and enjoy the ride?

402
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:04,436
This is where it happened,
ten years ago today,

403
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:05,808
when Sasha died.

404
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,123
Olivia, pull over and
let's talk about this.

405
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,293
It was raining, just a miserable night.

406
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,621
She shouldn't have been driving.

407
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,593
Olivia, slow down!

408
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:19,576
Olivia!

409
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:29,817
Olivia, there was nothing
you could've done.

410
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:32,188
It was an accident.

411
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:35,727
No.

412
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:40,728
She drove into that
concrete wall on purpose.

413
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:44,128
She wanted to die.

414
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,017
Uh, Ned, you wanted to see me?

415
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:01,352
Yeah. Come in and shut the door.

416
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:04,924
You wanna tell me what's going on?

417
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:07,427
I don't know what you mean.

418
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:09,843
Well, since when does a 250-word obit

419
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,106
turn into a 2-column expose
on Cold War espionage?

420
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,630
This Mr. Diebold story, it...
it inspired me.

421
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:17,836
Mm-hmm. I can't put my finger on it, Annie,

422
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,187
but something's not right here.

423
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:22,301
I talked to the editors
upstairs about this.

424
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:23,231
You know what they want me to do?

425
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,346
Have you write 1,500 words
on this Kandinsky guy.

426
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,526
Deadline's tonight. Can you do it?
Absolutely.

427
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:31,142
Great. What do you have on him?

428
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,778
Well, he was a very elusive character.

429
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,499
Uh, he...

430
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,077
Grew up just outside of Saint Petersburg

431
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,807
in a tiny fishing village.

432
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,127
Uh, he became a hired
gun after the Cold War.

433
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:47,629
Oh. Rumor has it he slipped
through the border

434
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:48,932
and was living in Canada.

435
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:50,791
Uh, sure you got enough for the story?

436
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:52,273
Yeah, I have an excellent source.

437
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:53,797
Well, every fact better check out.

438
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:56,354
It's the kind of story that
can make a career, Annie.

439
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:03,000
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

440
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,228
I'd be careful doing that.

441
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:07,517
Oh. Right.

442
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:09,844
How's it going?

443
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,953
Good. It's, uh...

444
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:14,194
It's going great, actually.
I think I got a new job.

445
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:14,925
Yeah? You know...

446
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:17,656
That's fantastic. Congratulations.
Thank you.

447
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,147
- Hey, you're a lawyer, right? 
- Yes.

448
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,195
Do you know anything about breaking leases?

449
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:23,305
Why? You guys thinking about moving?

450
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:25,908
Nah, it's just, you know, Lou
is still kind of freaked out

451
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:26,793
about this place.

452
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,867
Uh, you know, I-I love it here, but...

453
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,940
You want me to take a look
at your lease for you?

454
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,250
That'd be great.

455
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:34,934
Well, so what do you think?

456
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,319
Any wiggle room?

457
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:38,610
Oh. I don't know.

458
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:40,785
Gavin drew it up pretty ironclad.

459
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,489
Clearly he doesn't like
people breaking deals.

460
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:47,505
Hey, maybe you could talk to him for us.

461
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,643
I mean, you guys have
gotten pretty tight, right?

462
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,250
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.
We... we work for him.

463
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,431
Hey, you guys went to the Lincoln center,

464
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,945
cocktail parties, club. Hey, trust me.

465
00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:59,913
The old resident manager wasn't
taking a steam with Gavin Doran.

466
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,178
We didn't take a st...

467
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:03,873
All right, I'll see what I can do.

468
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:06,005
Hey, why don't you let Lou and
I take you guys out tonight

469
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,137
to celebrate?

470
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,410
Uh, you know, it's... it's not official.

471
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:10,546
There's a bunch of I's to dot.

472
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:12,944
Listen, man, this town
is hard enough as it is.

473
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:15,637
Just one thing I've learned...
celebrate success.

474
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,830
Yeah. Sure. That'd be great.

475
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,498
Let me, uh, let me just talk to Jane.

476
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:20,705
Where do you guys wanna go?

477
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,084
No clue. We have not been
below 14th street yet.

478
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:24,163
Seriously? Wow.

479
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:26,360
We used to go out all the time.

480
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:29,468
I mean, Lou was just dialed
into that whole world

481
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,447
until we had to slow things down.

482
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,382
You know, city got pretty tempting.

483
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:35,483
Yeah. I see how that can happen.

484
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,909
Nice view, huh?

485
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,677
You remind me of her, you know?

486
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,248
How so?

487
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:54,008
She was curious like you.

488
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:57,884
Sasha loved exploring the Drake.

489
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,602
Mm.

490
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,125
You have her same spirit,

491
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:02,709
same energy.

492
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,195
And then, when she was about 15,

493
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,333
something... happened.

494
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:15,062
More than the usual adolescent angst.

495
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,052
Something changed, and...

496
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,053
I could never reach her again.

497
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:25,217
I was the one who found the note.

498
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,649
Olivia, y-you don't have to...

499
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,224
I've never told anyone about it.

500
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,385
Even Gavin?

501
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,856
Gavin doesn't know.

502
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:39,105
And Gavin won't know.

503
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,624
Sasha and Gavin had a falling
out the night before,

504
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,994
and it wasn't his fault, but I...

505
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,001
He'd blame himself, I know.

506
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:52,216
At least I can spare him that pain.

507
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,859
It's the least I can do.

508
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,640
I admire your courage, Olivia, but...

509
00:25:57,937 --> 00:26:01,423
Ten years is a long time to
carry that kind of burden.

510
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:03,882
Oh, I'm not carrying it alone.

511
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,040
Not anymore.

512
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:10,266
Yeah, I don't know what happened
between you and your daughter,

513
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,270
but...

514
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,359
I would've loved to have a mother like you.

515
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,183
That's sweet, Jane.

516
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,699
But I'm much too young to be your mother.

517
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,073
Ohh. Welcome home, darling.

518
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:27,773
Hello, ladies.

519
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,543
Well, uh...

520
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:31,399
I should probably be getting back.

521
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:33,831
Jane, thanks for lunch.

522
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:36,937
You're very welcome.

523
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:39,313
Good night, Gavin.

524
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,682
You have to stop blaming yourself, Liv.

525
00:26:58,892 --> 00:26:59,842
It was an accident.

526
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:08,243
Hey, babe.

527
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:18,922
What was that for?

528
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:21,415
I missed you today.

529
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:23,563
Well, I can't wait to see what happens

530
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:25,188
when I tell you that I got a new job.

531
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,103
- You what?! 
- Yeah.

532
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,654
I-I didn't even know you were looking.
What happened?

533
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,259
It's not official yet, but
there is an opportunity

534
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:33,947
with a city councilman to
be his chief of staff.

535
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,255
Now I wish I could take all
the credit, but it was Gavin.

536
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:39,160
Honestly, he... he brought
something out of me today.

537
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:40,519
He challenged me. It was amazing.

538
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,836
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

539
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:44,423
So get ready because we're
gonna go out and celebrate

540
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,474
with Brian and Louise.

541
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,877
- Is she up to it?
- Uh, yeah.

542
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:49,416
Apparently, Brian says she's feeling great.

543
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:29,728
Henry, I-I'm gonna be right back.

544
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,769
Oh, my God.

545
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:00,898
It's bad in there.

546
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,672
What's bad?

547
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:08,021
Hello, Jane.

548
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:10,665
I'm sorry I startled you.

549
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,385
I just came down for these,

550
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:16,861
the original blueprints.

551
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,841
Oh. Yeah, thanks, Gavin.

552
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,433
Deal's a deal.

553
00:29:22,689 --> 00:29:23,467
Have a good night.

554
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,998
Gavin, wait.

555
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:32,910
S-sometimes these buildings
can be a little creepy.

556
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:34,665
Yeah.

557
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:36,833
I know just what you mean.

558
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,590
Wow! Look it! You guys look great!

559
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:57,144
Yeah, I clean up good.

560
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:57,837
Ready to go?

561
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,072
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

562
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:00,747
So what exactly are we doing tonight?

563
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:03,156
We, my friends, are gonna go dancing.

564
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,018
Louise, this is amazing!

565
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,904
I used to come here a lot in high school.

566
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,953
I'm sorry. I can't hear you. What?

567
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:20,730
It's a long story.

568
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,954
I used to be a total club kid... thank you.

569
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,610
Before my White Knight here

570
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:27,426
rescued me from a life
of debauchery and fun.

571
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:29,282
Oh, that's not the exact story.

572
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:32,371
Brian's play had just
come out on Broadway...

573
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,537
if I could brag for a second.

574
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:36,644
He was the toast of the town.
I just rode his coattails.

575
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,351
Dude, I had no idea you
were, like, a big...

576
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,644
Success? Eh, it was a while ago.

577
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,293
You guys, I'm so glad we're doing this,

578
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:44,143
especially as you're... you're moving out.

579
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,729
What? What are you talking about?

580
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,449
Oh! Henry said you were looking to move.

581
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,687
Hey, honey, did you know that
Jane thinks the Drake is haunted?

582
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,762
Oh, I-I...

583
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:53,587
- I never said haunted. I...
- I never said "haunted."

584
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:56,155
I-I may have said something when
we were working on your lease.

585
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,036
Uh, I think I said "ghost," maybe.

586
00:30:58,037 --> 00:30:59,604
Uh, not like you're afraid of ghosts,

587
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:01,583
but I'm really... uh, I'm drowning, babe.

588
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:03,860
- Yeah, you need to stop talking. Yeah.
- You just jump in and... okay, thank you.

589
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,500
Okay, wait. I'm... I'm confused.

590
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,168
Why would you be looking over our lease?
What the hell, Brian?

591
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:09,209
No. No, no, no.

592
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,956
It was just to see what our options were.

593
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:12,884
That makes absolutely no sense.

594
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:16,165
Our apartment is amazing. Gavin
made right with the accident.

595
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,933
There's no reason we're gonna need to move.

596
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:20,260
Aah! Oh, my God. Alexis just got here.

597
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,515
Hey! Come here!

598
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,663
How hilarious!

599
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:24,877
Brian, how random is that?

600
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:29,317
It's pretty random.

601
00:31:44,784 --> 00:31:46,969
All right, Mr. Kandinsky,

602
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:49,112
what is your story?

603
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,259
"A ruthless figure of the Russian mafia,

604
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,586
"Kandinsky has eluded law enforcement

605
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,426
"in several countries.

606
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:06,142
"It's been years since
anyone has seen his face.

607
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,520
"A lethal enforcer,

608
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:13,315
"Kandinsky was known to
torture his victims to death

609
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,246
"with pliers and wrenches,

610
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:19,463
"which he carried in a
so-called 'murder kit, '

611
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:24,274
his face marked by a jagged scar."

612
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,061
Hello?

613
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,738
Is somebody there?

614
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,079
No! No!

615
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,656
Help me, please!

616
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,105
Please, help me!

617
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:30,779
Your call cannot... Be completed as dialed.

618
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,538
No! No! Please hang up and try again.

619
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:41,678
Listen, I am sorry I
said anything to Brian.

620
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,902
All right? I will never
betray your trust again.

621
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,057
Okay? Like it or not, we're
gonna be together forever,

622
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,280
so that's an enormous
commitment I just made.

623
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:52,079
- You're drunk.
- This is true.

624
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,471
But it doesn't change what I said.

625
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:53,974
It just means that

626
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:55,506
I probably could've said
it a little bit better.

627
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:58,177
You know what? Take me
home and all is forgiven.

628
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:00,987
I love you.

629
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:01,778
I'm sorry.

630
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:05,245
I couldn't quite hear you over
the thumping bass in here.

631
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:07,103
- I love you.
- Say what?

632
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:12,522
Ah, thank you, Gavin.

633
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:15,041
Now that I've hired your boy,

634
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,410
time to talk about my
favorite part of the deal...

635
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,161
my compensation.

636
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:22,776
The boy... is your compensation.

637
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,626
He's the best hire you'll ever make.

638
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:26,995
Well, I'm sure he's very
industrious, but, uh,

639
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,487
be a shame to crush his dreams.

640
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,568
Oh, you let me worry about his dreams.

641
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:33,676
You should be more concerned

642
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:37,198
about getting me the
greenpoint towers project.

643
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,084
Is that what this is about?

644
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:42,013
I mean, come on, Gavin.

645
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,642
We've been through this.

646
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:45,928
There's nothing I can do.
I don't own the building.

647
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,856
I am a simple councilman...

648
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:49,752
Who controls all the redevelopment rights

649
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:50,871
in your district.

650
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:54,692
Why are you so interested in Greenpoint?

651
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,921
It's one broken window
away from being condemned.

652
00:34:57,922 --> 00:34:58,939
How is that a good investment?

653
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,522
So says the simple councilman.

654
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:04,043
Now I'd like to help you out
here, Gavin, but I can't.

655
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:07,844
In fact, there's a... there's
someone else, another investor.

656
00:35:07,845 --> 00:35:09,705
It seems I underestimated your greed.

657
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:12,897
It won't happen again.

658
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,402
So what's the number?

659
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:16,899
Well, there is no number.

660
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,741
Something more than that, more than money.

661
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,304
Let's just say that, uh,

662
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:25,139
he understands what it is
that I'm really after.

663
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:29,649
Enlighten me.

664
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:03,468
Come on. Let's go.

665
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,850
Oh, we're having fun!

666
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,095
Come on, baby, dance with us!

667
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,559
Yeah, Brian. Loosen up.

668
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:10,441
I wanna go.

669
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,678
I'll call you! Good-bye!

670
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:12,880
And there's no way I can change your mind?

671
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,801
I wouldn't have lasted this long

672
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:17,352
in New York politics if I
wasn't a man of my word.

673
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:19,561
Yeah, you're a paragon of integrity.

674
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,916
Hey, come on. I hired your boy, didn't I?

675
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,683
All things considered,

676
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:24,933
you had a pretty good day, huh?

677
00:37:50,832 --> 00:37:51,881
Henry.

678
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,626
Mr. Doran said he wanted to
see you when you got in.

679
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:55,981
It's 2:00 in the morning.

680
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,614
He said tonight.

681
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:59,477
Message delivered.

682
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,085
Well, maybe he found out
what we did in the limo.

683
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:08,452
No one better find out.

684
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,778
- I'll be back in five minutes. 
- Mm. Okay.

685
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:35,735
Don't.

686
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:37,563
What?

687
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,331
Don't what?

688
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,433
Don't let him out.

689
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,294
You wanted to see me, Gavin?

690
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:13,776
Come on over, Henry.

691
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:22,867
It's so peaceful this time of night,

692
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:26,525
when everyone's dreams are real,

693
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:29,976
until the sun comes up and
they realize that they're not.

694
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,445
And that's why I wanted
to talk to you, Henry.

695
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:36,184
What do you mean?

696
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:39,212
This Bill Edwards job, I've
been thinking about it.

697
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:43,255
Maybe it's not for you.

698
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:45,983
What do you mean? Did you hear something?

699
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,649
No, but I know men like Edwards.

700
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:51,684
Too many skeletons in the closet.

701
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:53,432
He's never gonna be a real player.

702
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,190
I think chief of staff for a councilman's

703
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,866
a pretty big step for me.

704
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:58,536
No, no, no. You don't get it, Henry.

705
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:01,022
You don't want to be the
one to work on a campaign.

706
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,878
You want to be the one with the campaign.

707
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:06,898
Dream big.

708
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:11,561
You've gotta want it all.

709
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,037
Help me, somebody!

710
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:31,929
Somebody help me!

711
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:34,220
Help!

712
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:22,270
Hello?

713
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,744
Is anybody in there?

714
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:48,738
Is anybody in here?

715
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:53,960
