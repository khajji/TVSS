1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:03,660
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"666 Park Avenue"...</i>

2
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:04,851
Washer number three's leaking.

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,019
Anything else I should know?

4
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:07,120
Well, there's a thief
in the building.

5
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,355
I'll keep an eye out.

6
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:09,856
I like your necklace.

7
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,291
You and I are the same.

8
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,460
We have to fight to get
what we want.

9
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:15,595
Don't come back
without the job.

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,164
I get the feeling like
the dead won't stay dead.

11
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,299
<i>Don't.</i>

12
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,267
Don't what?

13
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,601
<i>Don't let him out.</i>

14
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,938
Write 1,500 words
on this Kandinsky.

15
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:28,642
A lethal enforcer
of the Russian mafia...

16
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:31,177
The story I wrote.
It isn't true. I made it up.

17
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:32,245
Aah!

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,849
<i>No!</i> Help me, please!

19
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,302
Let's see
what the great Annie Morgan

20
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,237
has written for us today.

21
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,276
"A ruthless figure
of the Russian mafia,

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,945
"Mr. Kandinsky has eluded
law enforcement

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,313
"in several countries.

24
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:09,585
It's been years since anyone
has seen his face."

25
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:15,103
I was under the radar
for 20 years,

26
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:20,408
then I see this article
you wrote in the newspaper.

27
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:23,011
Somebody talked to you.

28
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:26,614
I swear,
nobody talked.

29
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,216
Okay?

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,051
I know this sounds crazy.

31
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:31,719
Uh, I made it up.

32
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:35,223
I made <i>you</i> up

33
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:37,792
and I-I didn't know
that it would come true.

34
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:40,361
Please. You have to...

35
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,075
okay, uh, please.

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,512
I'll retract the story.
Can't you just let me go and...

37
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,817
You have pretty eyes.

38
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:03,254
Such a shame to cut one out.

39
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:06,691
No, please. I am... I am telling
you the truth, okay? Nobody...

40
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,226
shh. No good idea to move.

41
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,293
Messy.

42
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,932
It was my boss Ned!

43
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,535
Ned Shifley! He was the source!

44
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:24,408
Your friend better give me
answer or I come back

45
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:27,912
and cut out both your eyes.

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,634
How should I wear my hair
tomorrow night?

47
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:42,537
Up? Down? Beehive?

48
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,839
Mohawk? Henry? For the party
at the mayor's house?

49
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,107
Huh?

50
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:48,809
Okay, where's your head at?
What's wrong with you?

51
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,745
I just got an e-mail
from councilman Edwards

52
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,580
canceling my interview
out of nowhere.

53
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:56,517
And, like, I thought
we really bonded. I...

54
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,985
oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

55
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:03,309
Listen, <i>you</i> are amazing,

56
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:04,877
and there are gonna be

57
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:07,313
so many amazing opportunities
for you in this city.

58
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:10,016
This one just...
it wasn't meant to be.

59
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,317
Yeah?

60
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,818
Yeah.

61
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:13,986
Yeah.

62
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,688
You make me forget about it.

63
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:16,822
Whoa! Oh.

64
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:18,024
What is that?

65
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:21,961
Uh, I found a locked suitcase
in the basement.

66
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,797
It's cool, right?

67
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,767
How many boyfriend points
do I lose if I say no?

68
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,702
At least ten.
And I may be forced

69
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,270
to wear my hillbilly teeth
to the party tomorrow night.

70
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,405
Well, I love those.

71
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,373
And for the record,
I love your old suitcase.

72
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:36,242
Come on. Aren't you at least

73
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:39,178
a little curious
as to what might be inside?

74
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,580
I'm guessing dust mites.

75
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:43,583
You're no fun.
And you're late. Come on.

76
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,318
I'm not late.

77
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:11,554

79
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,405
Hello?

80
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,374
Olivia, hi.

81
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,043
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

82
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:25,145
I'm breaking one
of Emily post's cardinal rules.

83
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,246
No. You're safe with me.
Please.

84
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,349
Um, can I get you,
uh, coffee, water,

85
00:04:29,383 --> 00:04:31,952
sparkling water? Nothing. Thank you.
I'll just be a minute.

86
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:34,421
Well, is something wrong?

87
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:36,056
The Drake thief.

88
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,924
Tony just informed me
that he struck again.

89
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,926
We need to get rid of him,
Jane.

90
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:43,663
Hire a Detective,
install cameras,

91
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:44,698
whatever you need to do.

92
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,633
Just find him

93
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,101
or her.

94
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,736
It's bad for the building.

95
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,271
I'll do my best.

96
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:52,806
I mean, I would love to get
my grandmother's necklace back.

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,508
And I'd like to get
my diamond brooch back, too.

98
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,812
Whoever it is, I want 'em out.

99
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:02,315
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
tomorrow at the mayor's house?

100
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,517
There'll be a lot
of powerful players.

101
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,353
Big opportunity for Henry.

102
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,787
Which means I need to look

103
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:11,024
the part of an important
guy's girlfriend. Got it.

104
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:12,258
What would you say
if I told you

105
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,160
I bought
a vintage Dolce & Gabbana

106
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,695
at a consignment store
for 90% off?

107
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,932
I'd say you're learning.

108
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:40,120
♪ so come on, honey,
blow yourself to pieces ♪

109
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:43,490

00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,794

♪ Youth knows no pain

113
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:57,404
Hey, Ingrid. Come on in.

114
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:58,805
Good morning, Nona.

115
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,042
Mmm. Something smells good
in here.

116
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:04,811
Uh, my grandma baked them
before she left.

117
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,679
Oh, she's...

118
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:09,082
She's not gonna be here? Again?

119
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:12,152
She's super sorry.
You know how it is at her age.

120
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,087
Another sick friend.

121
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,656
Well, let's get started then.

122
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,191
I've really reached

123
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,494
a new level of calm in my life.

124
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,696
Calm. Peace.

125
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,298
It's pretty beautiful.

126
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,434
I'd say I'm just about cured.

127
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:29,102
Cured?

128
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,871
So you don't need me anymore?

129
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,442
Nothing personal.

130
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:37,077
I think I'd like
to schedule a session

131
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:38,778
when your grandmother
is around.

132
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:39,913
You know, I'd really like
to get her take

133
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,748
on how things are going. Okay?

134
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:45,085
Sure. Uh, we'll set it up
as soon as we can.

135
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:53,526
You know that I'm just...

136
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:56,096
I'm just trying to help you,
right?

137
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:17,016
What's the latest
on the councilman Edwards deal?

138
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:19,619
Well, you'll be happy to know
that he officially blew me off.

139
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,821
I know you think that job
wasn't right for me anyway.

140
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,157
His lack of taste
proves my point.

141
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:26,226
Have you thought
about what I said?

142
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,795
Maybe running for office
yourself one day?

143
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:30,597
Just every second
of every minute.

144
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,233
I mean, look,
it's a great fantasy,

145
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,069
but right now, I have to focus
on the job I actually have.

146
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:38,171
Listen, Henry, there's something
you should know.

147
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:41,808
Your office has me
under investigation.

148
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,209
What are you talking about?
I'd heard rumors,

149
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,879
but this morning I got
confirmation from my lawyer.

150
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,780
They're saying I've gotten
inside information

151
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,782
on several land deals.

152
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,051
Gavin, I-I had no idea.

153
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,052
It's nothing to worry about.

154
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,654
Of course. It's probably coming

155
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,456
from one of my competitors
on the Greenpoint towers deal.

156
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,926
Some people will do anything
for a piece of land.

157
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,928
Well, maybe I can talk
to Commissioner Pike about...

158
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:03,997
I won't have you putting
yourself in the middle

159
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,965
and I certainly
don't hold you responsible

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
for your boss' actions.

161
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,568
I appreciate that.

162
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,103
What's important is
that we don't let

163
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,671
this little bit
of unpleasantness

164
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,406
affect our relationship.

165
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,345
Help me!

166
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,289
Aah!

167
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,965
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,873
Hey, Nona.

169
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,508
Cool sunglasses.

170
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:47,876
Thanks.

171
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,749
Thanks.

172
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:58,887
Oh, just the girl
I was looking for.

173
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,389
Did I leave my sunglasses
in your apartment?

174
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:03,057
Uh, no. Definitely not.

175
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,226
Maybe you dropped them outside.

176
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:06,861
And the Drake thief
strikes again.

177
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,164
We don't know that. Hi. I'm...
I'm Jane, the building manager.

178
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,733
Hi. Ingrid Weissman. I'm, um...

179
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,753
A.K.A. My shrink.

180
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,955
Oh. Everybody in New York
is in therapy, right?

181
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,723
Daddy issues. Twice a week.

182
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,493
So what do your sunglasses look
like? I'll keep an eye out.

183
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,361
Oh, right, they're, uh,
they're black and round.

184
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,362
They have two "c's" on the side.

185
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,331
Let me give you my card.

186
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,433
If you find them. Thank you.

187
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,001
You're welcome.

188
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,037
Let me walk you out.

189
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,595
ned?

190
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,164
ned, are you there?

191
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,400
ned, it's an emergency!

192
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,108
Oh, please pick up.
Please pick up.

193
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,709
Please pick up. Please pick up.

194
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:17,358
ned?

195
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:19,193
Oh.

196
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:23,164
Oh, God.

197
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:32,707
Oh!

198
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:39,480
Hello?

199
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,183
I had fun
with your friend.

200
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:45,420
You're a very bad girl.
You lied.

201
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:46,554
You're next.

202
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,572
Hey, Nona. Uh, I was wondering

203
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:09,408
if I could speak
to your grandmother, please.

204
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,611
Sorry. She's at A.C.

205
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:13,645
Atlantic City.

206
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,047
Oh. She takes the old
people party bus

207
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,314
and plays slots all day.

208
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:17,582
Well, maybe you can help me.

209
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:21,653
Uh, do you recognize
any of this stuff?

210
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:24,189
Uh, nope.

211
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:25,991
Okay. Hand it over.

212
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:29,327
All of it, including
my grandmother's necklace.

213
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:33,134
You're saying I took all this?

214
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:36,003
Yeah. Next time you want to hide
your criminal activity,

215
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,571
don't wear the evidence.

216
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,944
I'll tell you what.

217
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:46,180
I'll just set a meeting with
you, me, your grandmother,

218
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:49,317
and Olivia Doran, and we can all
just talk about it then. Okay.

219
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,451
Jane, wait. Don't leave.

220
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,455
I didn't take your necklace.

221
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,489
Really?

222
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:57,258
I swear, I didn't.

223
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:02,430
But, you know, maybe I have
some of the other stuff.

224
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:14,575
Henry.

225
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,011
Commissioner Pike.

226
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,979
Come inside.
Somebody wants to meet you.

227
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,915
Sure.

228
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:28,556
Henry, this is
A.D.A. Regina Wilson.

229
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,591
She's gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

230
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,059
About what?

231
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,362
You're familiar with the, uh,
Alpern deal, Mr. Martin?

232
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:36,697
Sure. Uh, yeah.

233
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,766
The site turned out to
be next to a toxic waste dump.

234
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,278
And you were aware of its status
at the time of sale?

235
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,413
Yes. And did you share this
knowledge with anyone?

236
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:46,549
No. Gavin Doran bought the
land and turned right around

237
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,118
and sold it to a group
of Chinese investors overnight,

238
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:51,854
hours before the environmental
report became public.

239
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:54,157
Rumor has it
you two are besties.

240
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,060
I've done nothing illegal
or unethical.

241
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:06,983
We have hundreds of these.

242
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,219
At dinner at their apartment...

243
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:10,487
You were the last person

244
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,956
that Gavin Doran saw
before he sold the property.

245
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,391
You had me followed?

246
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:16,793
We're having him followed.
You happened to be there.

247
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:18,728
Doran has somebody
in this office,

248
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:19,996
and it appears to be you.

249
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,198
You will lose everything...

250
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,234
your job,

251
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,335
your reputation.

252
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:26,736
You will be disbarred.

253
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,238
Unless I'm innocent.

254
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:30,540
I'm innocent.

255
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:36,120
You have access to Doran.

256
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:39,557
You could obtain
the kind of documentation

257
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:40,691
that would put him in a cell

258
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,994
right next to his good friend
Bernie Madoff.

259
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,397
Whatever it is you're asking me
to do, I won't do it.

260
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,466
Take a day. Think about it.

261
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,602
We don't want to ruin you.
But we will.

262
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,020
<i>Shh!</i>

263
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:30,355
<i>He'll hear me.</i>

264
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:31,990
Who?

265
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:33,491
Please.

266
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:34,926
Tell me.

267
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,515
You and Jane
will not take the subway

268
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:20,883
to the mayor's tomorrow night.

269
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,518
You will ride with us.

270
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:24,453
Defy her at your peril.

271
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,788
I think, um,

272
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:29,058
I think Jane actually wanted
to go to dinner first.

273
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,560
So we'll have to
get back to you on that.

274
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,164
I'll leave you two.

275
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,074
Whatever you're
working yourself up to say,

276
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:47,243
I'm guessing
it's not good news.

277
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:48,644
Gavin, I so appreciate

278
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,913
everything you've done for me
and Jane,

279
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,014
especially me.

280
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:53,449
This sounds like

281
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,688
the beginning
of a break-up speech.

282
00:15:57,534 --> 00:16:00,135
I just think that we probably
shouldn't socialize

283
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,071
until the investigation
is over.

284
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:04,073
Oh, that's
what's bothering you?

285
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,508
I assure you, there is
nothing to worry about.

286
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:07,776
Gavin, in my position,

287
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,945
even the appearance
of impropriety...

288
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,280
Pike got in your head.

289
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:12,348
Gavin...

290
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:13,482
do you believe
this investigation is

291
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,250
anything more than a charade?

292
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:16,986
I'm sure, but...

293
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,420
Commissioner Pike

294
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,356
is manipulating you.

295
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,025
He's using you to get to me.

296
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,793
Bringing down
the great Gavin Doran

297
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:27,229
would skyrocket his career.

298
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:30,432
I don't think
that's what this is about.

299
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:36,705
Are you aware that your boss
has been lining his pockets

300
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,842
with developers' dollars
for years?

301
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:42,378
It's the worst-kept secret
in Manhattan.

302
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,508
That's funny. You've never
said that before.

303
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:49,144
I didn't want to put you
in a bad spot, Henry.

304
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:53,782
Gavin, why have you been so nice
to me and Jane?

305
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:54,884
We're nobodies.

306
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,852
Because I see something in you,

307
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:59,221
something I haven't seen
for a long time.

308
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,557
The gifts, the flattery,

309
00:17:01,591 --> 00:17:04,393
V.I.P. Access to all New York
has to offer...

310
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:06,862
at what point do you expect me
to start paying you back?

311
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:10,299
Now you're insulting me.

312
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,134
You wanted me to tell you
that Alpern land

313
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,003
was next to a toxic waste dump.

314
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,572
I do my own research,

315
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,440
and that includes getting
soil analysis

316
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:21,076
of any property I bid on.

317
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:29,985
It was a test.

318
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,088
Sit down, Henry. Have a drink.

319
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:36,492
I'm such an idiot.

320
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,726
Careful, Henry.

321
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,224
You walk through that door,
things change.

322
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:49,932
I know you have a plan
for Henry,

323
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,935
but maybe it's time
to cut him loose.

324
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:55,270
If it comes to it,

325
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,673
I'll do what I have to do.

326
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,623
Hey.

327
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,094
Jane, from the... the Drake.

328
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,562
Oh, right. Hi.

329
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,398
Oh. I-I found your glasses.

330
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,799
Someone turned them in
to lost and found.

331
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,101
Really? That's great.
That's great. Thank you.

332
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,069
You're welcome.

333
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,337
Thanks.

334
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:31,206
Was, uh, was there something
I can help you with?

335
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:33,676
Uh, yeah, yeah, I...

336
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,744
I wanted to ask about Nona.

337
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,546
I can't discuss a patient
with you.

338
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,548
No, I-I don't want
to know her secrets.

339
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,316
I just...

340
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,352
I want to know more.

341
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:46,755
All right,
here's what I can say.

342
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,024
A year and a half ago,
there was an accident,

343
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,993
and both of Nona's parents
were killed.

344
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:53,876
I didn't know.

345
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:55,211
Now you know.

346
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:58,114
And from what I can tell,
her grandmother is never around,

347
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:00,917
so she's practically
raising herself.

348
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,487
Listen,
I-I-I lost my mom young,

349
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:07,223
and, you know,
my dad wasn't exactly around,

350
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,491
so...

351
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,559
I get what she's going through.

352
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:12,595
She just needs
someone that she can trust,

353
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,798
and it's not gonna be me...

354
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,135
But maybe it can be you.

355
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:27,502
Gavin, thank goodness.
I need your help.

356
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:31,106
I wrote a story
about this man, Kandinsky,

357
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,175
and I-I mean, I made him up,

358
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,410
and now he's trying to kill me.

359
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:39,214
He already... he... he already...
he... he killed my editor,

360
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:40,782
and it's all my fault.

361
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:47,756
You wanted to change the world
with your voice.

362
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,925
That's a...

363
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,566
Noble ambition.

364
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,738
I can make Kandinsky go away,

365
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:01,275
but I'll need you to write
one final article...

366
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,844
a piece about the corrupt
city planning Commissioner.

367
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:06,113
No, I-I don't want
to do it again.

368
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:08,048
I don't want
anyone else to die.

369
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,785
I promise no innocent lives will
be lost if you write this piece.

370
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,421
I can tell you everything
you need to know.

371
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:16,123
I'll even give you a headline.

372
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:21,028
And Kandinsky
will never bother you again.

373
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,223
Tony, I'll be back
in a few hours.

374
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,358
Have our car outside at 7:00.

375
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,893
Uh, Mrs. D.

376
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:40,428
Mrs. D., wait.

377
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:46,100
Jane discovered the thief.

378
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:48,102
Uh, no.
I came back from a delivery,

379
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:49,737
and there was
a whole bag of stuff

380
00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:50,772
just sitting behind my desk.

381
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:52,640
Been playing Santa claus
all afternoon.

382
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:55,310
Well then.
Keep up the good work.

383
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,508
Hello?

384
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,372
Hello?

385
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:05,136
Completely understand.

386
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,101
Uh, next week?

387
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,638
Oh, hold on.
Let me check my calendar.

388
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:28,806
Yeah.

389
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:04,580
So what do you think? This one?

390
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,118
Henry?

391
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:12,121
Uh, yeah, it looks great.

392
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:13,790
Mm.

393
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,025
I miss
my grandmother's necklace.

394
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:20,763
Have you ever met
Nona's grandma?

395
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,468
You know, I worry about her.

396
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:28,571
She's so different.

397
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,072
You know, she reminds me
of me when I was 14

398
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:32,642
and really pissed at the world

399
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,211
and really, really lonely.

400
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,713
Henry?

401
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,202
Are you okay?

402
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,304
Yes. Everything is great.

403
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,207
Everything is so great...

404
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:49,410
Including that necklace.

405
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,615
Baby, how about we skip out
on this shindig

406
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,450
and we go watch the game
somewhere?

407
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,986
Well, now I know
something's wrong.

408
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,355
You wanted to go to the mayor's
house since I met you.

409
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:01,489
I'm kidding.

410
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:04,692
I wouldn't miss tonight
for the world.

411
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,662
And you look beautiful.

412
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,230
Okay.

413
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,918
Babe,
we're gonna be late.

414
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:41,905
Hey. Hey.

415
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,606
Hey.

416
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,946
I guess she told you
I'm the notorious Drake thief.

417
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,614
Actually, no, she didn't.

418
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:54,050
Oh.

419
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:55,818
And I won't.

420
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:59,022
I won't tell anybody as long
as nothing else goes missing.

421
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,057
Thanks.

422
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:02,191
You're welcome.

423
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,696
Whoa.

424
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:14,857
You okay?

425
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,025
Yeah.

426
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:18,561
All right.
I'll, uh, I'll get a cab.

427
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:25,234
Keep Henry away from the man
with the compass tattoo.

428
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,936
He has a gun.
He's dangerous, Jane.

429
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,304
He's gonna hurt Henry.

430
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:31,107
Nona, what's going on?
What are you talking about?

431
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,776
Just do it.

432
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,194
I feel like I should curtsy.

433
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:55,765
That makes two of us. Let's go.

434
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:02,204
Oh. I'll take one of those.

435
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,405
Thank you.

436
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,007
Thank you.

437
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,410
Hey. Relax.
It's just the mayor.

438
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,370
Okay. Let's go eat free food.

439
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,439
Yes.

440
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:41,222
Yes?

441
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:42,256
It's done.

442
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,258
"City planning Commissioner
investigated,

443
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,160
ties to mob."

444
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:47,695
I just sent it to my editor.

445
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,797
Good girl.

446
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,233
You will never see Kandinsky
again.

447
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:53,667
I promise.

448
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:04,612
Henry.

449
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,447
Hello.

450
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:09,283
No need to respond.
We might be under observation.

451
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:11,385
Gavin,
I'm not going to apologize

452
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:13,887
for caring that my behavior
be above reproach.

453
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:15,956
Above reproach.

454
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,359
Right.

455
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:24,965
You forgot this.

456
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:45,024
Jane, I think, uh...
Hey, Henry,

457
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:47,993
check out the prime photo op.
Okay. Maybe later.

458
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,697
Olivia, will you please
tell my boyfriend

459
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:53,098
that having his photo taken
with the mayor

460
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:54,967
does not make him a fan boy?

461
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,036
You have gall showing up here.

462
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,638
My husband has gone out of
his way to open doors for you.

463
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,342
Olivia... and you take the
word of a crook over his?

464
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:06,211
Sorry.
H-have I missed something?

465
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:08,213
Henry is aiding his boss

466
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:10,682
in an investigation of Gavin.

467
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:13,419
Oh, well, I'm... I'm sure
there's been some mistake.

468
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:14,820
Yeah.

469
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,655
A big one.

470
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,212
Babe, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to worry you.

471
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,481
Okay, well, I'm... I'm worried,
Henry. I'm definitely worried.

472
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:26,549
I understand.

473
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,651
Commissioner Pike
brought in the A.D.A.

474
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:29,752
They started questioning me.

475
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,421
They... they were accusing me

476
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,589
of giving inside information
to Gavin.

477
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,590
Why?

478
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,625
Leverage.

479
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,627
They want me to help them
take down Gavin.

480
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,629
Okay, but you think
Gavin's innocent, right?

481
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:41,831
I thought so.
And now I'm not sure.

482
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:43,967
He's saying that Pike is dirty.
Pike is saying that he's dirty.

483
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:45,668
Okay. Okay.
What are you gonna do?

484
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:46,636
I don't know.

485
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,037
I don't know.

486
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:50,373
They can spin my relationship
with Gavin any way they want.

487
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:51,641
Forget about
the mayor's office.

488
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,810
I'll be back in Indiana
zoning strip malls.

489
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,379
No, you can't let them...
any of them... intimidate you.

490
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:57,981
That's easier said than done.

491
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:01,084
I don't care
what zip code we come from.

492
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:04,848
You're your own man.
Don't you forget it.

493
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:16,354
I decided I need the twinkies.

494
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:17,822
Comfort food.

495
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,091
Hmm. I read your article.

496
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,226
That Commissioner is
seriously in trouble.

497
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:25,263
Yeah, he'll...
he'll probably go to jail.

498
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:28,032
No way the mob's gonna let him
get nabbed by the cops.

499
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,267
He'd flip on them.

500
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,235
So what, do you...

501
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,803
Do you think they'll kill him?

502
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:36,374
And they'll
probably use your guy to do it.

503
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:37,708
Kandinsky.

504
00:31:43,115 --> 00:31:45,283
Oh, my God.

505
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:46,884
What have I done?

506
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,559
Excuse me.

507
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:06,103
Do we have something
to talk about?

508
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:07,939
We do.

509
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:09,373
I have Gavin's file.

510
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:13,811
We have to do something
about Henry.

511
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,548
It's already done.

512
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,184
Cooperating with us is
a smart move.

513
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:22,210
You won't regret it.

514
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,179
But I decided
I'm not gonna look at it

515
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:25,447
and neither are you.

516
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:28,183
I'm not gonna compromise myself

517
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:30,452
for anyone, including my boss.

518
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:31,820
I thought you had ambition.

519
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,154
I do.

520
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:37,125
High horses and city politics
don't mix, Henry.

521
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,094
I'll make this very bad
for you.

522
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:43,031
You will lose everything.

523
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:45,867
Not everything.

524
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:50,705
Hey. Let me through, please.

525
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:53,641
Uh, I have to warn him.

526
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:55,143
You're fired.

527
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:12,594
Gavin was right.

528
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:17,301
You're a crook.

529
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,107
Oh! Excuse me.

530
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,100
Henry!

531
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:53,337
Get down!

532
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,877
Get down! Everyone, get down!

533
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:05,950
- He's got a gun!
-  He has a gun!

534
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,302
Oh, my God!

535
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,939
She's been shot.

536
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:11,579
Oh. Evening, folks.

537
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:17,619
Uh, Tony, I don't know
if you heard the news,

538
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:19,654
but Annie Morgan was shot
tonight,

539
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:22,357
and... she didn't make it.

540
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,993
That's... that's awful.
What happened?

541
00:35:26,462 --> 00:35:28,329
I don't know.
We don't know the details.

542
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:30,131
It looks like
an attempted mob hit.

543
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,834
She was an innocent bystander.

544
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:34,202
Poor kid.

545
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,737
Yeah.

546
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,872
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to get the image of her

547
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,740
out of my mind.

548
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,846
Excuse us.

549
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:04,929
You two go ahead.

550
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,764
Jane and I will get
the next one.

551
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,351
You were right.

552
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,987
Pike got in my head.

553
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,688
I'm sorry I doubted you.

554
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:33,925
You're young. It's hard to know
who you can trust.

555
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:37,428
Not anymore.

556
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:40,498
Gavin, I know
you're looking out for me,

557
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,701
and I appreciate that
more than I can say.

558
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,909
Purely selfish on my part.

559
00:36:47,943 --> 00:36:51,446
I like hitching my wagon
to a rising star.

560
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:56,818
Tonight is
another reminder.

561
00:36:56,852 --> 00:37:00,455
We can't take anything
in this life for granted.

562
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:04,425
You must be proud of Henry.

563
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,080
You must think I'm an idiot

564
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:07,748
for not knowing what was
going on with him.

565
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:10,251
Naive, yes. Idiot, no.

566
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:16,852
Anyway, you sussed out
the Drake thief.

567
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,755
Well, um, not exactly.

568
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,391
Um, the stuff just showed up.

569
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:25,494
I get the feeling
you're protecting someone.

570
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:28,097
I assume you have your reasons

571
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,800
and I'll let it go at that.

572
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:34,470
Thank you for everything.

573
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:48,117
Uh, it's kinda late, isn't it?

574
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,853
I wanted you to know.
Henry's fine.

575
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:52,555
Okay.

576
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:54,757
It all happened, Nona.

577
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:57,846
Whatever you saw or felt...

578
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,550
Whoa. Okay. No clue
what you're talking about.

579
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:03,151
You saved Henry's life.

580
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:05,454
I saw the compass tattoo.

581
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:08,056
You knew Henry was in danger.

582
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,693
Sleep it off, Jane.

583
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:15,030
You'll feel better
in the morning.

584
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:18,467
You're special.

585
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,370
I know being different
can be scary,

586
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:26,839
but I want you to know if you
ever need to talk to anyone

587
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,741
about anything...

588
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:31,944
I'm here.

589
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:40,119
I shouldn't have warned her.

590
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:43,723
I should've kept my mouth shut.

591
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:45,424
But I couldn't.

592
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:51,364
I actually think...

593
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:55,134
I think I can trust her,
grandma.

594
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,937
And maybe she can help you.

595
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,135
Hey.

596
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,476
You should have told me
you were in trouble.

597
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,979
You're right.

598
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:42,648
You're right. I should've.
I just...

599
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,697
I wanted to protect you.

600
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,935
We're supposed to protect
each other.

601
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:53,438
You're right.

I was right about Henry.
He's a hero.

609
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,541
And so all's forgiven?

610
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:30,443
Everybody's allowed

something was wrong?

I just...

629
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,983
I looked up
and happened to see his gun.
