1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:03,867
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...

2
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:06,185
I was right about Henry. He's a hero.

3
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:08,723
I can take your 15 minutes
and make it a lifetime.

4
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:10,545
Oh! 
Am I interrupting something?

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:13,824
She's his patient. He's
examined her a bunch of times.

6
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,313
He got out.

7
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,370
Who? 
Daddy.

8
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,185
Look out! 
Aah!

9
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,977
There's no sign of a body anywhere.

10
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,827
How does a body just disappear?

11
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:24,827
You have no idea. 
What you've stolen.

12
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:28,168
Return the box before it's
too late for both of us.

13
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,192
This is not over.

14
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,660
Jane?

15
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,096
You okay?

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,926
Baby, what you went through last night,

17
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:22,707
it's gonna take some time to get past it.

18
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:28,010
Well, listen, I didn't want to
wake you, but the police called.

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,506
Two detectives will be coming over later

20
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,714
to talk about what happened,
if you're feeling up to it.

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,385
Yeah. Yeah, I mean...

22
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,622
The sooner the better, right?

23
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,020
Yeah.

24
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:42,620
Definitely.

25
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,121
Look, Jane, the police are
gonna find this psycho.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,665
I just...

27
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,036
I wish I knew why he came after me.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,837
I'm gonna get you some coffee, okay? 
Okay.

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,474
Besides the Drake being robbed,

30
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,641
other assets of yours were also targeted.

31
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:12,696
Four major buildings

32
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:15,921
had their security systems
hacked and disabled.

33
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,992
Someone's sending a message
that they can get to me.

34
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:21,611
Yes, you and your wife.

35
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:26,386
Not a word to Olivia about the robbery.

36
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:27,329
I don't want to scare her.

37
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,426
Of course. 
Better if she doesn't know.

38
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,081
Who is behind this, Sam?

39
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,973
I want this bastard found quickly.

40
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,546
Yeah?

41
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:30,226
Do you have it?

42
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:32,719
Yeah. I got it.

43
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,021
Then $1 million is yours, Mr. Wallace.

44
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:39,477
Today at noon, Gramercy Park.

45
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,802
What's--what's in this thing?

46
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,725
It's not important.

47
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:44,655
But it's important enough

48
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:47,434
for you to pay me a million bucks for it.

49
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:51,604
Maybe it's important enough for
someone else to pay me double.

50
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:55,025
I'll give you $3 million for the box.

51
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,275
3 will do it.

52
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,797
On one condition.

53
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:05,529
Mr. Wallace?

54
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:08,809
Uh, yeah.

55
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,406
What's that?

56
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,850
Don't open the box.

57
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,217
Ms. van Veen? I'm detective Jarvis.

58
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:45,180
My partner detective Cooper.

59
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,495
Mind if we ask you some questions?

60
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:51,231
Please, come in.

61
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,666
I don't know why

62
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,073
my husband is insisting upon a blood test.

63
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,629
All this fuss isn't necessary.

64
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,136
But thank you, Dr. Evans.

65
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,190
Oh, that's one of the perks

66
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:09,146
of having the cardiology
wing named after you.

67
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,745
All right, I'm gonna rush these results,

68
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,335
um, but I wouldn't be too concerned

69
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:14,772
about fainting last night.

70
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,107
Now this is just my humble medical opinion,

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,503
but I think you have a common case of, uh,

72
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,776
champagne-itis.
Oh.

73
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,645
Now I need you to relax...

74
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,016
And not move for a couple minutes.
Can you do that?

75
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:28,247
Ah, I'll try.

76
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,455
Here you go, darling. 
Mm.

77
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,321
Feel better. 
I'll walk you out.

78
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:34,155
Hell of a party.

79
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:35,643
A little rough for you, apparently.

80
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,994
Oh, this? 
Yeah.

81
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:39,389
This was a-a misunderstanding.

82
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,775
Ah. Thanks for the house call.

83
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,849
Listen, could you do me a favor?

84
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,388
I want you to bring me
the test results first.

85
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:50,275
And about the underpayment
in your rent this month,

86
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:51,888
we'll call it even.

87
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,248
Yeah, that.

88
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:55,173
My apologies. I...

89
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,617
Perhaps I was bit optimistic,

90
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:58,984
thinking I could manage
a park Avenue address.

91
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,600
I was under the impression that E.R.
doctors made a good living.

92
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:02,543
We do,

93
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:03,977
but unfortunately I'm still paying off

94
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,061
the education that got me here.

95
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,750
People...

96
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,126
Trust you with their lives.

97
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:14,145
I think I can trust you with a loan.

98
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,373
Really?

99
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:21,429
You know, I-I wouldn't feel right

100
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,589
accepting money from you, Mr. Doran.

101
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,809
Everybody needs a band-aid
now and then, even doctors.

102
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:28,526
How much do you need?

103
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,394
Would say, uh...

104
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:36,713
$50,000 be too much?

105
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,941
So it's--it's right here.

106
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,486
After he killed the man
in the devil costume,

107
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,161
he chased me down here to this dumbwaiter.

108
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:57,451
So you climbed inside and pulled
yourself to the fifth floor?

109
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,966
Yes.

110
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:02,153
I barely made it out
before he cut the rope.

111
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,111
Please take a look at this, ma'am.

112
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:13,534
Wait. I don't understand. I...

113
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:17,114
I was right here. I-I crawled inside. I...

114
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:28,198
You have the recording of the 9-1-1 call.

115
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,834
I mean, I-I found her on the fifth floor.

116
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,497
Sure, Mr. Martin.

117
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:35,284
Did you see the killer
that she's talking about?

118
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,975
What about the man she saw killed?

119
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:43,651
Could it have been a Halloween
prank someone took too far?

120
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:44,384
No, I--

121
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,491
Look, I don't know why there's
no sign of what happened,

122
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:47,966
all right, but Jane was attacked,

123
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,278
and you need to be acting like
this guy is still out there.

124
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,239
Respectfully, Mr. Martin,
that's what we're doing.

125
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:06,177
Come on in, Tony.

126
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:09,225
I, uh, I wanted to apologize

127
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:12,051
for losing Mrs. Doran
last night at the party.

128
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:14,901
There were circumstances
beyond your control.

129
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,095
Yeah, yeah. 
Well...

130
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,691
And thank you, by the way,

131
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,919
for, uh, saving me from
those circumstances.

132
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,215
I, uh, I definitely owe you one.

133
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,197
I'm glad you feel that way.

134
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:29,979
There's a job I think
you'd be well-suited for.

135
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,766
Detail the limo?

136
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,851
Uh, more along the lines of the other work

137
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,900
that you've done for me sometimes.

138
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:43,170
There is some new information on
who tried to run over Olivia,

139
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,527
and I need someone brought
to the Drake for a meeting,

140
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:50,132
and I'm certain he will refuse the request.

141
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,857
Well, my, uh, mother always said

142
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,488
I had a persuasive charm about me,

143
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:57,824
and my father always said I had
a pretty good overhand right.

144
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:00,472
Feel free to make your father proud.

145
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,232
Mr. Wallace couldn't follow
simple instructions.

146
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,278
Don't open the box, Charlie.

147
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,299
Torch it.

148
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,397
What are you doing up so early?

149
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:15,983
Oh. Um... nothing.

150
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,397
I-I just... couldn't sleep.

151
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:22,572
I'm in the mood for pancakes.
You want some?

152
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,484
Yeah.

153
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,758
Your blood test was pretty conclusive.

154
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,811
Too much alcohol, not
enough hors d'oeuvres,

155
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:43,477
and that combination put your
glycemic number in the basement.

156
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:46,223
Sometimes I forget to eat when I get busy.

157
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,727
Sorry for the trouble, doc.

158
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:48,800
No trouble at all.

159
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,367
Can I get you some more coffee?

160
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,147
Yes, please.

161
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:53,217
Honey? 
No, thank you.

162
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:54,658
Okay.

163
00:10:57,676 --> 00:10:59,016
Look, Mr. Doran,

164
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:02,287
there's some information that I
didn't cover with your wife.

165
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,958
Her tests showed a powerful
anesthetic in the blood.

166
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,501
Actually, chloroform.

167
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:12,499
Olivia was the victim of
some foul play at the party.

168
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,163
I'm handling the situation,

169
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,313
but I appreciate your
discretion in the matter.

170
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:19,465
Well, I figured, we're helping
each other out, right?

171
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,006
That's right.

172
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,934
Did the money get wired into your account?

173
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,661
Yes, it did.

174
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,924
Thanks again.

175
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:46,994
Number 6 was a whole furlong back!

176
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,699
Detective Cooper.

177
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,417
Oh, Mr. Martin. What can I do for you?

178
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,264
I'm just checking in.

179
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:11,100
Any leads on the guy who attacked Jane?

180
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:12,131
Not really.

181
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,364
Not really? 
That's unacceptable.

182
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,684
Jane is ready to move because
that psycho is still out there.

183
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:24,224
Have there been any... problems
between you two lately?

184
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:25,699
What?

185
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,624
Not at all. What does that
have to do with anything?

186
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,267
Well, being upset can manifest
itself in negative ways.

187
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:32,955
Sometimes people see
things that aren't there.

188
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:35,416
What the hell are you
getting at, detective?

189
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,104
I mean, if you could've
seen the look in her eyes

190
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:38,866
when I found her... she was terrified.

191
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,195
She's not making that up.

192
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,333
Just a question, Mr. Martin.

193
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,138
Is there any history of mental
illness in Jane's family?

194
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,206
Why would you ask me that?

195
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:50,686
You and I both know

196
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,193
what we didn't see on the
walk through your building.

197
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:56,259
We didn't find a body
or single drop of blood

198
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,948
or any damage at all.

199
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:00,128
Should I keep going, Mr. Martin?

200
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,992
We're gonna keep working
things on our end, okay?

201
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:11,414
But if this is a more
personal issue with Jane,

202
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,364
maybe--maybe you're better
suited to deal with it.

203
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,769
Thank you.

204
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:24,742
Hello?

205
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,022
Okay, so I know you wanna

206
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:28,325
jump-start your political career, yes?

207
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,347
Laurel?

208
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:30,663
Yeah.

209
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:32,671
Honestly, this is a, uh,

210
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:34,295
it's a really bad time
for this conversation.

211
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:35,300
Okay, here's the deal.

212
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,996
You have lunch in an hour with people

213
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:41,213
who can turn your political
aspirations into reality.

214
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:43,269
When the opportunity of a
lifetime comes knocking,

215
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,059
you don't ignore it.

216
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,638
Where am I meeting them?

217
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:52,923
Well, uh, thank you for
taking me to lunch, Olivia.

218
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:54,489
I, uh...

219
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,211
I definitely needed to get out.

220
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:58,619
Oh, it's the least I could do.

221
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,139
I-I feel awful about what you went through.

222
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,531
God forbid you'd gotten hurt.

223
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:08,841
So y-you spoke to the police.
Do--do they have any leads?

224
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:11,838
I doubt they're gonna catch this guy.

225
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,405
It's just a-a feeling I have.

226
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:18,962
Well, Jane, I don't want you
to feel unsafe at the Drake.

227
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,232
I'm just...

228
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:24,375
I'm starting to feel like
I don't belong here.

229
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:30,392
Would you excuse me for a second? 
Sure.

230
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:43,956
Enjoying your lunch, Mrs. Doran?

231
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,892
I take it you're not the sommelier.

232
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:51,721
No, but you might want a
drink after we speak.

233
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,662
Your husband isn't who you think he is.

234
00:14:55,663 --> 00:15:00,614
Underneath those impeccably
tailored suits is a monster.

235
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,511
What do you want, mister...

236
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,862
Shaw. Call me Victor, please.

237
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,258
I'm here to give you the opportunity

238
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,468
to distance yourself from your husband

239
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:15,072
before I take him apart.

240
00:15:16,193 --> 00:15:17,449
You think you're the first person

241
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,852
who thought they had a chance at that, huh?

242
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,833
Your husband excels at hurting people

243
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,170
and taking everything from them.

244
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:27,062
He took something from me,

245
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:30,850
and now I have the
opportunity to take it back.

246
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,200
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw.

247
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:36,949
I don't concern myself
with Gavin's business.

248
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,351
You should start,

249
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,041
'cause while he gives you the life that

250
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:45,764
lets you wash down $40
appetizers with champagne

251
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:50,140
and makes you feel special
and makes you feel safe,

252
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:51,455
you should know

253
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:55,329
all of it's just a lie that
he's whispering in your ear.

254
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,851
Or you're lying to me now.

255
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:05,659
Get a blood test

256
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,331
from a doctor who isn't
in your husband's pocket,

257
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,987
and then ask Gavin why
he's hiding the truth

258
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:15,146
about what really happened Halloween night.

259
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:24,622
Gavin, this is really not my thing.

260
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,742
No, Sam, pay attention.

261
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:29,302
We're gonna find out who betrayed us.

262
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,719
Hey, hey, I-I-I don't know
what you think I did,

263
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,135
but you got the wrong guy here.

264
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:40,333
I know exactly what you did, Mr. Trent.

265
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,979
Oh, that? That was nothin'.

266
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,864
I-I was just supposed to give
her a scare, that's all.

267
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,355
Mm. Well, I've been known to
scare a few people myself.

268
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,149
Luckily for you, I'm more
interested in who hired you.

269
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,786
So give me a name and you can go.

270
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,658
I never met him. W-we
just talked on the phone,

271
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,079
and he dropped off the
cash and instructions.

272
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,813
I don't believe you.

273
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:11,555
A name, Mr. Trent, if you
want to ever leave the Drake.

274
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,615
I'm sorry, Gavin, but I really
shouldn't be here right now.

275
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,842
Sam. 
Hey, Sam.

276
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,481
No stomach for the rough stuff, Sam?

277
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:26,628
Gavin, please. You think you
can get that guy to talk?

278
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,297
Sam, you of all people

279
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,376
should know how persuasive I can be.

280
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,233
What are you gonna do to him?

281
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:35,952
Same thing I'm gonna do to you.

282
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:45,662
Help!

283
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,312
Help!

284
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,678
Hey, somebody help me!

285
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,737
Somebody!

286
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:23,991
Somebody help! 
Hello?!

287
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,388
Somebody!

288
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,848
Don't be afraid.

289
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,519
Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

290
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,170
Your, uh, doorman said you'd
be up on the fifth floor.

291
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,590
You here to point out more
inconsistencies in my story?

292
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,150
Not exactly.

293
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,510
I'm here

294
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,470
to ask you about this man.

295
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,310
Oh, my God.

296
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,639
That's--that's him.

297
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,079
That's the man in the devil costume.

298
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,229
I saw him get killed.

299
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,219
Where did you find him?

300
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,980
We traced the call you
made to Henry's phone.

301
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,290
Guy's name is Leo Forster.

302
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,580
His girlfriend reported him
missing two hours ago.

303
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,630
Oh, my God.

304
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,650
I'm not saying

305
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,770
you held something back
from me and my partner.

306
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,060
If you did,

307
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,540
I'd do my best to hear it right now.

308
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,040
If I told you the truth...

309
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,650
You'd think I was crazy.

310
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,350
I'm a New York City cop, miss van Veen.

311
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,090
I'm highly trained for crazy.

312
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,730
Okay.

313
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,179
When I said before

314
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,390
that I didn't see the face of
the man who attacked me...

315
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,370
Well, uh...

316
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,390
That's not true.

317
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,170
I saw him.

318
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,170
I... spoke to him.

319
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,870
It was this man.

320
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,650
Uh, Peter Kramer.

321
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,320
A ghost attacked you.

322
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,400
That's what you're saying?

323
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,500
Wanna call Bellevue and put me
in a straightjacket right now?

324
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,299
Don't worry.

325
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,530
I think Henry's pretty close
to making the call himself.

326
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,430
My grandfather died when I was 8 years old.

327
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,930
We'd been pretty close.

328
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,460
Afterwards, I thought I could feel his...

329
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,190
Presence around the house.

330
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,050
I could even smell the
cigars he used to smoke.

331
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,690
Well, my folks wrote it off--

332
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,610
my memory of him with an
overactive imagination.

333
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,429
One day, I'm helping my dad fix
our old wall heater in the den,

334
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,040
and he pulls out this box of
cigars from behind the vent,

335
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,660
and he tells me this is
what I've been smelling,

336
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,410
that my grandfather's ghost wasn't real.

337
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,059
You're saying that there
is a logical explanation

338
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,230
for what's happening to me?

339
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm saying...

340
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,430
People want there to be
a logical explanation.

341
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,670
It's what I realized

342
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,240
when I found out my dad
had bought those cigars

343
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,770
and hid them in the vent for us to find.

344
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,590
He didn't want me seeing anymore ghosts.

345
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,220
And now...

346
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,300
That's why I like to keep an open mind.

347
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,180
Jarvis. 
I gotta go.

348
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,740
Thanks for the coffee, miss van Veen.

349
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Laurel.

350
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,740
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I was on a call.

351
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,940
How's your shirt?

352
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,040
What's wrong with my shirt?

353
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,740
Okay, well, lose the tie.

354
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,189
If I can't change the package,

355
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,930
I can at least change the ribbon.

356
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,850
Uh, I can do this.

357
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,140
Debatable.

358
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,839
Okay, so you are meeting
with New York kingmakers

359
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,110
Jeffrey Lang, Matthew
Thompson, and John Buckley.

360
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,249
Buckley? I've heard of Buckley.

361
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,009
Yeah, you should've.

362
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,030
He's backed the last four
mayors of this city.

363
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,660
You kiss his ring,

364
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,050
and doors will open.

365
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,040
You're welcome.

366
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,150
Four mayors? 
I should've changed my shirt.

367
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,790
How do you feel, Olivia?

368
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,950
I can't seem to get rid of my headache.

369
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,510
Gavin... how much did I drink?

370
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,430
Well, before the absinthe?

371
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,779
I recall seeing you with

372
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,209
a bottle of Bollinger '97 at some point.

373
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,939
And, uh,

374
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,080
and then there were the Martinis
at the top of the night.

375
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,390
Guess I really overdid it.

376
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,100
Well, you were never shy at a party.

377
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Should I have Dr. Evans come back?

378
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,690
No, I-I think a massage
would probably be better.

379
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,210
Well, I can arrange for
one of those as well.

380
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,180
Gavin, thank you for...

381
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,630
Looking after me.

382
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,230
That's what a man does
for the woman he loves.

383
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,430
Why don't I go set up
that appointment for you?

384
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,930
Henry, slow down!

385
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,570
What's wrong?

386
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,919
Look, you were amazing back there.

387
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,879
They loved you.

388
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,729
They kept asking me questions about Jane.

389
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,589
She should've been there.

390
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,940
Hey, do you want me to provide
advice and perspective?

391
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,300
I'll take that as a "yes."

392
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,329
Having Jane on your arm

393
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,110
is not the image that you need right now.

394
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,009
What the hell does that mean?

395
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,919
It means New York's most
eligible bachelor--

396
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,929
whether or not it's true-- is good for you.

397
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,759
It gets you noticed, especially by women.

398
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,480
Let me be clear with you, all right?

399
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,800
Who I am--my life, my values--
Jane is a part of that.

400
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,739
Look, Henry, your girlfriend is
sweet and kind and beautiful,

401
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,669
but look me in the eye and
tell me that you think

402
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,410
she understands what it takes
to succeed in this town.

403
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,689
No matter how much you love her,
she is never gonna understand

404
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,000
your drive to make a mark in city politics.

405
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,750
You're wrong.

406
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,300
I hope I am.

407
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,420
Before you use the exit, I
thought we should talk.

408
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,620
How did you know it was me?

409
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,089
Mr. Trent never put it together

410
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,829
that you were the man who made the call,

411
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,759
but the look in your eyes

412
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,700
when you saw him tied to that chair...

413
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,050
That was all I needed.

414
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,250
Gavin, come on.

415
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,899
We got a lot of history.
I can make it right.

416
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,910
I can help you get your box back.
I'll do anything.

417
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
Tell me what it was all about.

418
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,219
As far as I know, money.

419
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,270
The plan was to set up a
dinner between you two.

420
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,559
He'd bring your box,

421
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,430
you'd bring him the $10 million
in bearer bonds, and...

422
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,440
Come on.

423
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,330
Let's get out of here.

424
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,920
You mean it?

425
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,630
I just thought of a way you can be useful.

426
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,520
Gavin?

427
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,710
I want the truth--

428
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,269
not a version of the truth, not
what you think I wanna hear.

429
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,139
What are you talking about?

430
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,390
You gonna make me ask again?

431
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,999
I got another blood test,

432
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
from a different doctor.

433
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,580
Chloroform?

434
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,579
The Drake had an uninvited guest

435
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,280
the night of the Halloween party.

436
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,630
He knocked you out,

437
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,190
used you to distract me while
he broke into the safe.

438
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,319
This... whole charade

439
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,770
because of bonds and jewelry?

440
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,880
Not the safe in the closet.

441
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,440
Oh, my God.

442
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,790
Are--are we... in danger?

443
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,450
Let me trade my apology for a promise.

444
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,490
I will not let anything happen to you.

445
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,189
This is the man I believe is
responsible for the theft.

446
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,979
I don't know his name yet, but--

447
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,090
Victor Shaw.

448
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,240
He, um, he approached me today at lunch.

449
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,680
He was trying to use me to hurt you.

450
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,690
I just thought he was a creep.

451
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,790
Hurt me how?

452
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,640
Well, turning me against you.

453
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,460
He knew you weren't telling
me what had happened.

454
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,740
But...

455
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,040
How could he know that?

456
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,840
Same way he knew about the red box.

457
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,410
Steinberg.

458
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,970
Sam?

459
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,940
Sam betrayed us?

460
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,540
I've dealt with the problem.

461
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,490
I don't want to leave another message.

462
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,060
I need to speak...

463
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,500
We need to talk.

464
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,149
Dr. Evans, is this about
using my generosity

465
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,320
to indulge a gambling habit?

466
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,760
No. 
What the hell is going on?

467
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,700
H-how did I get this tattoo on my chest?

468
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,590
Well, they say that a debt
is a mark against the soul.

469
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,779
Of course, we could just forget
about the dollar figure,

470
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,590
see if we can work out
another form of repayment.

471
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,920
Anything.

472
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,710
I believe there's great value
in having a doctor on call.

473
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,240
Okay, I could do that for you.

474
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,690
But... when I do call you,

475
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,510
it'll be in your best interest to answer.

476
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,890
Hey, I'm here.

477
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,930
Over here.

478
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,820
What are you doing?

479
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,810
I was looking for a pen,

480
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,760
and I saw this article on the desk.

481
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,349
Everything you told the cops
about Halloween night--

482
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,360
it's all here, Jane.

483
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,119
What happened in 1929

484
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,260
is almost exactly what you described.

485
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,600
You think I made it all up?

486
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,190
Yeah, I don't know what to think.

487
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,020
Is this all because you
wanna leave the Drake?

488
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,470
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

489
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,189
Oh, come on, Jane. We're
not gonna talk about this?

490
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,110
Well, it sounds like you
have it all figured out.

491
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,000
Hello, Mr. Shaw.

492
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,920
I see no introductions are necessary.

493
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,980
You gift wrapped my money.

494
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,720
It was a Olivia's idea.

495
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,240
You left quite an
impression on her at lunch.

496
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,140
She's lovely. You're a lucky man.

497
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,550
She's so full of life.

498
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,240
You didn't bat an eye at the price.

499
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,750
We both know this isn't about money.

500
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,630
It's about justice.

501
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,910
I'm going to take everything
away from you, Gavin,

502
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,430
just like you do to everyone else.

503
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,160
You fancy yourself a hero then?

504
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,969
No, I'm... just a man who's found a way

505
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,020
to get back what you stole
from me a long time ago.

506
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,930
Oh, I don't return things once
they're in my possession.

507
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,799
That's why I secured my leverage first.

508
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,760
The red box.

509
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,400
Why don't you tell me what you really want?

510
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,330
I want the Drake,

511
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,349
and you're going to hand it
over to me, or I'm going to--

512
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,610
Open the box. 
Right.

513
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,030
You're confident you can
release what's inside?

514
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,410
Do you think that I would go
to the trouble of getting it

515
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,850
and not know what I was dealing with?

516
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,390
I think you're bluffing.

517
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
What does Olivia think?

518
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,450
Very romantic, what you did for her,

519
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,480
rescuing her from an obsessive lover.

520
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,529
But you couldn't just make him disappear

521
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,320
like your average resident,

522
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,480
because this particular resident...

523
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,110
Was anything but average.

524
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,990
So...

525
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,260
You imprisoned him.

526
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,680
I wonder what would happen if he got out.

527
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Now...

528
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,500
Still think that I'm bluffing?

529
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,549
I'm going to give you a chance

530
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,980
to walk away from this fight, Mr. Shaw.

531
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,420
And I strongly suggest

532
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,320
you accept my offer.

533
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,380
$10 million is a hell
of an expensive dinner.

534
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,470
Oh, it's not money.

535
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,170
It what happens when I win.

536
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,700
Listen, Henry, I...

537
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,480
I love you.

538
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,869
But the more I think about the Drake,

539
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,980
the more I know I need to leave this place.

540
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,050
Look, Jane, I, uh...

541
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,780
As much as I love it here, I love you more.

542
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,180
All right, so if we have to go
to Brooklyn or Jersey or...

543
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,030
I wanna go back to Indiana.

544
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,529
To Indi--what?

545
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,960
I've been thinking about it, and...

546
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,670
You know, things were...

547
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,529
They were... simpler there.

548
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,949
Jane. 
We were safe.

549
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,650
No, Jane, we need to talk about this.

550
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,530
I wanna stay with you, Henry.

551
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,150
I do. I wanna be with
you, but I can't be here.

552
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,900
If I stay here--if I stay
here, I'm gonna go crazy

553
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,399
or I'm gonna get hurt or... or worse.

554
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,929
Jane, you're having a whole
conversation about our life,

555
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,139
and I'm not allowed to be a part of it?

556
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,779
Well, obviously I want you to come with me,

557
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,589
but I can't ask you to do that.

558
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,159
I know that you need to be here.

559
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,019
Okay, Jane, you know what?

560
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,370
Whatever the truth is, tell me.

561
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,079
All right, don't hold anything back.

562
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,819
Tell me why you can't stay here with me.

563
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,380
I've tried. I've tried
to tell you the truth.

564
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,400
What?

565
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,610
I see things.

566
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,520
I hear things.

567
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,679
I do!

568
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,050
Okay, there is-- there is a darkness

569
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,790
coming from this place, Henry.

570
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,570
Peter Kramer tried to kill me.

571
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,410
And I know that that means he was a ghost,

572
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,560
but that doesn't mean that it wasn't real.

573
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,870
Jane, I think, um...

574
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,449
I think being in this building every day

575
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,410
is starting to freak you out.

576
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,080
You don't believe me.

577
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,250
I believe that you believe it.

578
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,060
But I think that maybe you
should start talking to someone.

579
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,050
I'm talking to you now.

580
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,320
I mean a professional, Jane.

581
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:01,999
You said it yourself.

582
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,960
You said your own grandmother went crazy,

583
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,920
and she was in an institution.

584
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,240
You think I'm crazy?

585
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,750
I'm worried about you.

586
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,120
I'm worried about us.

587
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,850
Well, this is pretty far

588
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,150
from a conversation about "us" right now.

589
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,399
I'm gonna go for a walk. I...

590
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,450
Henry.

591
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,989
Are you seriously leaving right now?

592
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,230
Yeah, I gotta think, Jane.

593
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,300
Henry, wait.

594
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,929
You come highly recommended,

595
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,900
Mr. Kandinsky.

596
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,140
How would you like to come and work for me?

597
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,120
One small problem.

598
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,470
I'm good at solving problems.

599
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:18,620
***

600
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,789
What do we got?

601
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,359
I got a prisoner ***

602
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,089
***

603
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,350
Hello? Back it up. Back it on out of here.

604
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,670
Dr. Evans,

605
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,560
I believe a new patient named
Kandinsky has just arrived.

606
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,340
Time to start repaying that debt.

607
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,909
I'm not killing a patient,

608
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,110
if that's what you're talking about.

609
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,599
This isn't about killing him.

610
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,770
It's about setting him free.

611
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,120
What if Shaw opens the box?

612
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,090
I'll never let that happen, Olivia.

613
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,220
Jocelyn.

614
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,670
You're my grandmother.

615
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:25,814
