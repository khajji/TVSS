1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:03,257
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...

2
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:05,063
From the first time you
looked through your window

3
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:08,357
and watched me undress, you wanted me.

4
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,453
Sasha and Gavin had a
falling-out the night before.

5
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:14,723
I was the one who found the note.
Gavin doesn't know.

6
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,306
You want me to kill this Victor Shaw?

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,682
At some point. But he
stole something from me.

8
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:19,572
I want it back.

9
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,269
I'll bring him to you alive.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,168
This is incredible.

11
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,433
Careful!

12
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,901
I'm proposing to Jane tonight.

13
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,839
I think this is something
I'm supposed to do.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,144
It's closing! Jane!

15
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:33,582
Nona!

16
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,073
- Thank you. 
- Sure.

17
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,160
Are we gonna be okay here?

18
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:25,174
Henry, I don't feel safe here.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,939
Do you understand?

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,866
I'm scared.

21
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,510
No one has seen her for over 36 hours,

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,671
so it's definitely cause for concern.

23
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,346
Now I'm not gonna speculate at this point--

24
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:41,574
Of course not. Any resources
you need, you let me know.

25
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,145
I'll call the police commissioner myself.

26
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,573
Thank you, but we've got
a lot of eyes on this.

27
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:47,005
Every cop in the city's got her picture,

28
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,238
including port authority.

29
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,894
Don't let us down, detective Cooper.

30
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,070
Bring Jane home.

31
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:55,759
I'll do my best.

32
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,480
I put flyers up all over.

33
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:00,829
Nothing.

34
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:03,311
Where is she?

35
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,979
Oh, Henry, we're so sorry.

36
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,204
I've got a call in to a
top-notch investigator I know.

37
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,132
He'll be here in a couple of hours.

38
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,439
Anything we can do to help,

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,026
let us know.

40
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,942
I appreciate it.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,492
Hey. So I spoke to Nona again.

42
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,425
Apparently, she and Jane
split up in the basement

43
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:25,194
while they were looking
for her grandmother.

44
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,083
She said it's the last time she saw her.

45
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,420
Why haven't you guys followed up
on the lunatic from Halloween?

46
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:30,332
The one that attacked Jane?

47
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,627
That seems like a pretty
obvious place to start.

48
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:35,549
We're tracking that. And a bunch
of other leads, too. Okay?

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,515
Call me if you hear anything.

50
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,436
Where are you, Jane?

51
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,593
You shouldn't have come here.

52
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,393
Henry!

53
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:25,204

54
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,940
Her name's Jane van Veen.

55
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:29,874
I posted the missing persons report.

56
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,820
You have any idea what happened to her?

57
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:34,010
She hasn't spoken since
your guys brought her in.

58
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:36,376
They found her wandering
around Times Square.

59
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,367
I've requested a psych consult.

60
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,062
Ma'am, I need to see her now.

61
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,102
I'm her boyfriend. I just got
a call that she was here.

62
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:43,460
Hey.

63
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,036
- Jane--where is she?
- Slow down. She's here.

64
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,909
- Where? I want to see her. 
- She's been through something, Henry.

65
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,893
She's really fragile right now.

66
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:52,629
Hey. Hey. 
Get your hands off me.

67
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,180
Jane?

68
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,886
Henry?

69
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:27,594
Mr. Doran?

70
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,057
We have her. She's okay.

71
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:32,327
That's excellent news.
What happened to her?

72
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,165
I'm not really sure yet.
But just so you know,

73
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,287
they're gonna still keep her at
the hospital for a little while.

74
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:40,067
Understood. I'll give Olivia the good news.

75
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:40,976
Thank you for the courtesy

76
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:42,776
of the phone call, detective.

77
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,289
You're welcome.

78
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:54,231
Why don't you make this easy on yourself?

79
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,096
Where is the box?

80
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,290
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about.

81
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,291
Only thing that came out
of his mouth was this.

82
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:24,418
Unfortunately, I see we're
at a impasse, Mr. Shaw.

83
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,866
I was hoping that as businessmen,

84
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:29,227
we could reach some kind of arrangement.

85
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:33,131
I know how you do business, Doran.

86
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:54,211
The M.R.I. shows no physical
damage to her brain.

87
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,203
Physically, she's fine.

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,600
It seems she's had some kind
of dissociative episode.

89
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,333
What do you mean, "dissociative"?

90
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,357
Basically, her brain is blocking
out something traumatic.

91
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,978
It's rare, but there have
been documented cases.

92
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,200
Sounds counterintuitive,

93
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:11,371
but for her to heal, she needs to remember.

94
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:12,895
All right, well--well,
how does she do that?

95
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,766
I want to keep her here for a few days.

96
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,863
Some intensive therapy,

97
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:18,167
there's a chance she could
start to work it out.

98
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:20,875
Look, doc, I-I know Jane
better than anyone,

99
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,770
and she won't want to be here.

100
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,512
I mean, is there a way I can take her home

101
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,059
and a doctor can see her there?

102
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,020
I know you want to take care of her,

103
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,371
but she needs to be in the hospital now.

104
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:32,244
Well, that's your opinion.

105
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,333
Look, we're required to keep her here

106
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,874
under observation for 48 hours.

107
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,459
It's the law.

108
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,071
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,805
Welcome home.

110
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,973
It's really good to be back.

111
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,644
So did you move in yet?

112
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:17,608
All moved in. Fifth floor.
I have an amazing view.

113
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,040
I can't wait to see it.

114
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,726
Louise.

115
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:23,887
You are looking rested.

116
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:27,155
Gavin, thank you so much
for helping with that, um,

117
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,250
thing that I called you about.

118
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:32,564
Those things are harder to get
into than Manhattan preschools.

119
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:36,046
I couldn't have gotten a spot without you.

120
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,489
You just take it one day
at a time, like they say.

121
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,944
Olivia and I are here for you.

122
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:41,977
Now what about you, Ms. Blume?

123
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:44,276
How are you settling into the building?

124
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,032
It's perfect.

125
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:49,345
I'm so glad to hear that.
Welcome back, Louise.

126
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,166
I'm sure Brian can't wait to have you home.

127
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,518
So what do you think Brian's
gonna say about me coming back?

128
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,087
What do you think? He's
gonna be happy to see you.

129
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,926
You have to tell him.

130
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,355
Brian?

131
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,083
Lou.

132
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,726
You're home.

133
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,468
How was the photo shoot?

134
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,523
There was no photo shoot.

135
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:30,866
What do you mean?

136
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:36,995
I was in rehab, Brian,
for prescription drugs.

137
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,886
Painkillers.

138
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,203
You've been using again?

139
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:48,990
I started taking the pills
after the elevator accident.

140
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,393
And then I couldn't stop.

141
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:55,815
And then you left, and I
didn't know what to do.

142
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:00,096
Why didn't you tell me, Lou?

143
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,426
You didn't need to go through that alone.

144
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,755
I wanted to. I just--

145
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,382
I couldn't.

146
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,757
I don't know. I was--

147
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,574
I was ashamed.

148
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:15,300
I feel like this could be a chance for--

149
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,136
for me to start over.

150
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:19,983
I know that sounds silly--
It's not silly.

151
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,238
It's not.

152
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,561
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

153
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:28,518
I'm so sorry about the whole
thing with Dr. Scott.

154
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,382
Look, don't be. I'm the
jerk who punched him out

155
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:32,426
because I didn't trust you.

156
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,718
I feel like this crisis
could be an opportunity

157
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,872
for us to start fresh.

158
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,666
No secrets this time.

159
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:50,843
No secrets.

160
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:56,977
I want to go home.

161
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,592
Jane, it's only 48 hours.

162
00:10:58,593 --> 00:10:59,983
I don't want to be here.

163
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:03,519
I know. But I don't think
it's such a bad idea either.

164
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,251
You think I belong here?

165
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,818
Jane, why can't you remember
what happened to you

166
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,654
when you disappeared?

167
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:11,454
I don't know.

168
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,655
I want you to come home and
I want you to be okay,

169
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:16,408
but we gotta make sure
this doesn't happen again.

170
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:18,173
I'm scared.

171
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:19,760
Me, too.

172
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:26,634
Did you tell the doctor
about your grandmother?

173
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,490
Jane, there's mental
illness in your family.

174
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,259
No, I didn't, because I'm not crazy.

175
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,970
Hello, Jane. I'm Nurse Potter.

176
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:40,097
I'll be taking care of you
while you're staying with us.

177
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:42,929
I just need to take your vitals, okay?

178
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,404
- Okay. - All right, I'm gonna let
you get some rest. I love you.

179
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,702
Open up?

180
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,668
Under your tongue.

181
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,821
I can tell we are going to get along

182
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:02,681
just great.

183
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,029
Thank you.

184
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,665
And now blood pressure.

185
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,035
Calm.

186
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,483
Jane, calm down.
No. No. No.

187
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,052
- No. No. No. No. No. Please. Please.
Don't do this. - Jane, stop it.

188
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,403
- Get off. Get your hands off me!
- Jane. Security!

189
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:21,763
Help! Help! Help!

190
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:24,581
- Get off now! I want it off! 
- Jane, stop. Jane. Hold her arms.

191
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:27,425
- I'm gonna sedate her. 
- No! No! No! No! No! Please!

192
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,235
You shouldn't have come here.

193
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:35,779
No! Help! Help! Somebody!

194
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,212
- Get off me! 
- Jane.

195
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,684
Get your hands off me! No!

196
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:00,821
Uh, Jane van Veen?
Yes?

197
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,634
I'm a friend of hers. It's
really important I see her.

198
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,599
Hey, Nona, right?

199
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,732
Hi, detective Cooper.

200
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,994
What's so urgent?

201
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:12,711
Uh, nothing. I just--

202
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,452
I just wanted to see how Jane was doing.

203
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:17,810
She can't remember anything about
the last couple days, so...

204
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,901
Oh, my God.

205
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,416
Nothing?

206
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:25,529
Do you have any idea what
might've happened to her?

207
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:28,810
I-I told you, no.

208
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,794
Well, I'm gonna be speaking with Jane soon,

209
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,887
if you want me to tell her anything.

210
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,894
Uh, when you see her,

211
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:40,177
will you give her this?

212
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,368
I hope she'll know what it means.

213
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,118
It was the blood pressure cuff.

214
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,334
Acted like I was gonna kill her.

215
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:54,709
Like that guy last month.

216
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,024
Julian waters.

217
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,570
I tied the tourniquet to draw his blood.

218
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,923
He started screaming that nonsense

219
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:02,479
about a spiral staircase.

220
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,766
It was just the tourniquet?

221
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,076
It took four of us to hold him down.

222
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:08,599
He's been in "D" wing ever since.

223
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:13,683
Found him wandering the streets, too.

224
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,369
Strange.

225
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,135
Julian.

226
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:32,052
Hey. One romantic reunion dinner coming up.

227
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:34,894
Don't worry, it's gonna to be okay.

228
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,588
Alexis is having some boy trouble.

229
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,498
That's too bad.

230
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,213
I'm really sorry to bother
you guys right now.

231
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:48,992
I know you have a lot going on.
I just--

232
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,455
I didn't know what to do.

233
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,660
Alexis is involved with a married man.

234
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:58,221
Oh. Sounds dangerous.

235
00:14:58,222 --> 00:14:59,871
I know.

236
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:02,638
Such a cliche.

237
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,995
Gosh, I'm a mess.

238
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,245
I don't feel bad about it, though.

239
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,309
His wife is a bitch.

240
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,300
She has serious baggage.

241
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,203
I mean, from the moment we met,

242
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,530
I could tell we were meant to be together.

243
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,475
I got it.

244
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,923
He needs me,

245
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,200
even if he doesn't know it yet.

246
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:34,853
Do you remember anything?

247
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:37,563
No. Nothing. I--

248
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,909
I need to get back to the Drake,

249
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,542
retrace my steps.

250
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,948
Well, look, if I can get
you released sooner,

251
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:45,464
I will.

252
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:48,644
I think...

253
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,973
I think there's somebody in here like me.

254
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:56,276
He's a patient named Julian waters.

255
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,822
The nurse said he's in "D" wing.

256
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,257
What do you mean, "like you"?

257
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:02,847
I mean...

258
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,578
found in the same condition.

259
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,989
Supposedly, he--he said things.
Uh...

260
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,869
Maybe he knows what happened
to me after I disappeared.

261
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,440
Do you recognize the name?
Mnh-mnh.

262
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,353
Does he live at the Drake?

263
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,690
I don't know.

264
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,547
Jane, the...

265
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,531
the "D" wing is high-security.

266
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:25,628
It's for violent patients.

267
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:28,827
Whoever this Julian waters is,
you don't want to talk to him.

268
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:34,812
I almost forgot. Nona...

269
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,595
wanted me to give this to you.

270
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,997
It's my, uh,

271
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,422
my grandmother's necklace. I...

272
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:52,772
I thought I'd lost it. I...

273
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:55,963
And this...

274
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,563
You know what they mean?

275
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,702
No. Uh, just...

276
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:06,219
sentimental value.

277
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,779
Thank you for this.

278
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,599
Oh. Yeah.

279
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:22,410
Jane?

280
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,713
Henry. Hi.

281
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,133
Detective Cooper.

282
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:30,264
Hey. I was just taking off.

283
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,800
I've been wondering...

284
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,676
how you know so much about me...

285
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,216
how you know about my business.

286
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,273
So I had Mr. Kandinsky do some digging,

287
00:17:57,274 --> 00:18:00,177
and it turns out, you're not a Shaw at all.

288
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,011
You used your mother's maiden name.

289
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:05,071
Your father's name is Joseph Lukin.

290
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:06,987
Quite a character.

291
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:11,337
I met him just after he
defected from East Germany.

292
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:15,969
And I seem to recall that
he had left behind a wife

293
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,230
and a young boy.

294
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:22,318
Any of this coming back to you?

295
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:28,878
He had a fire inside.

296
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:32,088
He was willing to do anything to succeed,

297
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:35,767
and that included abandoning his son.

298
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:38,477
Sad, really.

299
00:18:39,004 --> 00:18:40,831
Your own father.

300
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:44,437
Can't pick your family, can you?

301
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:48,523
No. You get what you get.

302
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,668
Take Sasha, for instance.

303
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,294
Sasha?

304
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,656
Your daughter. Remember her?

305
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,583
The one who died in the accident?

306
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,167
The one whose car spun out of control?

307
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:03,358
That is, if you trust what
the police report said.

308
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,155
Be careful where you step, Mr. Shaw.

309
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:08,842
Your wife knows the truth
about Sasha's death.

310
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,502
She killed herself.

311
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,872
It wasn't suicide.

312
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:21,720
She figured out who you really were,

313
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,917
what kind of man you were.

314
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,229
That's why she killed herself.

315
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,684
You terrified her.

316
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,800
This makes no sense.

317
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,924
Time for your pills.

318
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,529
It's okay. I-I don't feel like I need them.

319
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,904
Doctor's orders, Jane.

320
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,686
Take your pills or I'll make you take them.

321
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:27,498
Okay now.

322
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,110
Lights out.

323
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:13,349
Hello?

324
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:17,308
Hello? Can you hear me?

325
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:21,032
Julian waters.

326
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,034
I need to talk to you.

327
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,085
Who are you?

328
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,494
Please.

329
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:36,119
I need your help.

330
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,881
You work for him?

331
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:40,095
You think I'm gonna talk to you?

332
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,361
Did you live at the Drake?

333
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:45,274
Do you know about the mosaic?

334
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,393
The spiral stairs?

335
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:50,134
I told you to stop.

336
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:53,414
Please. You have to tell me.

337
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:01,504
Did you go down the stairs?

338
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:05,095
No.

339
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,125
I came up the stairs.

340
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:33,252
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

341
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,593
I had a chat with, uh,

342
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,086
with Mr. Shaw, and he told me something

343
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:43,337
that was quite disturbing.

344
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:46,669
About what?

345
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:48,084
About our daughter.

346
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:49,172
What about her?

347
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:51,507
Victor Shaw is of the opinion

348
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:52,960
that she didn't die

349
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:54,999
in that car by accident.

350
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,942
He thinks she took her own life

351
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:59,222
and he says you know this.

352
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:03,016
Is it true?

353
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,058
How do you know?

354
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:23,571
There was a not,.

355
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,922
From Sasha.

356
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,931
I burned it. Uh, Gavin,

357
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:32,561
she said some--some
terrible things about you.

358
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:35,716
I don't need protecting.

359
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,164
- I know you don't. 
- She was my daughter, too.

360
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,273
How could you keep this from me?

361
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:41,894
I had a right to know.

362
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:43,542
Because I loved you.

363
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,905
I didn't want to see you get hurt.

364
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:48,770
Gavin, she was gone.

365
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:55,590
Look, Victor Shaw is
using this to divide us.

366
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,947
The most important thing is
we get that red box back.

367
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,954
He hit you with the one
thing you couldn't bear.

368
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:05,531
Return the favor.

369
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,850
Wow. Somebody likes to
live on the edge. Sexy.

370
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,751
Don't you ever pull that
kind of stunt again.

371
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,342
Do you understand me?

372
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,466
I want you out.

373
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,055
You're gonna quit the job with Louise,

374
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,610
you're gonna leave this
building, and we are done.

375
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,611
Don't play hard to get. I
thought we were past--

376
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,333
This isn't a game.

377
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:35,840
I know it all happened
very fast between us,

378
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,469
but we can't fight fate.

379
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,565
The universe wants us to be together.

380
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:43,576
In time, you'll see it, too.

381
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:44,433
No.

382
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:45,756
I won't,

383
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,549
because it's all in your head.

384
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:49,942
I don't want you.

385
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:52,886
I don't want us. Do you--do you get it?

386
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,578
I want you out of my life.

387
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,627
Written anything good lately?

388
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,112
Yes?

389
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,827
Hmm. I wonder what got you over the hump.

390
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:11,064
You didn't get hot

391
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:13,582
right after we made love
the first time, did you?

392
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,838
You're insane.

393
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,400
That had nothing to do with it.

394
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,689
It's closing! Jane! Hurry!

395
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:44,181
Nona!

396
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:57,553
Julian?

397
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,188
Julian, it's Jane from the Drake.

398
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:09,975
Oh, my God.

399
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:14,332
Julian?

400
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:20,538
You shouldn't have come here.

401
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:43,268
That was nice.

402
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:46,047
God, it's been forever.

403
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,047
Yeah, no kidding.

404
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:52,861
Hey. You okay?

405
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:56,192
Yeah, I just, uh, I gotta get back to work.

406
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,973
Why don't I make us lunch?

407
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:00,423
I'm starving.

408
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:01,458
Sure.

409
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:16,884
What the hell?

410
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:20,697
How about a grilled cheese?

411
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,183
Come on. Damn it.

412
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,568
- What's wrong? 
- My computer's not working.

413
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,450
I just replaced the logic board.

414
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,585
You have a visitor.

415
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,607
I still can't remember anything.

416
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:27,518
All right. Well, give it time.

417
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,063
I want to come home.

418
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:30,764
Please.

419
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:32,981
I don't like it here.

420
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:34,349
I know. Soon.

421
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:37,500
A patient killed himself last night.

422
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:38,701
What?

423
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,974
His name was Julian waters.

424
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,496
He was in the security ward. He said--

425
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:46,685
He said? You talked to him?

426
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,335
How did you talk to him
if he's in another ward?

427
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:53,147
I snuck out of my room.

428
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:56,280
I had to see if he knew anything
about what happened to me

429
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:57,643
after I disappeared.

430
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:01,184
Why would he know what happened to you?

431
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:09,210
It's complicated.

432
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,660
Please. Henry.

433
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,921
You have to get me out of here.

434
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:18,577
Yeah, I'm--

435
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,504
I'm doing my best.

436
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:22,274
I'm not sick, Henry.

437
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,111
I know.

438
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:38,547
Victor.

439
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:40,960
Can you hear me?

440
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,198
Son.

441
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:46,643
Son.

442
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,792
It's me.

443
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,310
Impossible.

444
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,738
I'm sorry I didn't say good-bye.

445
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,070
I never thought I'd see you again.

446
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:01,243
I'm sorry for leaving you and your mother.

447
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,669
I always meant to send for you, but...

448
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,586
Well, there's no excuse.

449
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:12,354
Not really.

450
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,824
I should have.

451
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,530
I didn't.

452
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:21,211
Forgive me.

453
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,791
Of course I forgive you.

454
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,801
We are in danger here, son, both of us.

455
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,667
You have to give Gavin what he wants.

456
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:37,866
You understand?

457
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,394
I still owe him

458
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:42,104
and I'm running out of time.

459
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:43,871
Where is it?

460
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,250
I gave it to a priest,

461
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,597
where mama's buried.

462
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,423
Good boy.

463
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:58,283
I know exactly where that is.

464
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:03,382
What did you say?

465
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:08,833
Dad.

466
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:12,104
Hello, Mr. Shaw.

467
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:19,358
I was dreaming?

468
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,987
Your mother's buried at
Saint Thomas church.

469
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,144
Isn't that right?

470
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:27,223
What did you say?

471
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:29,743
The red box--

472
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:31,872
it's at Saint Thomas Church.

473
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:34,808
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

474
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,750
Damn you, Doran!

475
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:39,315
You son of a bitch!

476
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:52,383
Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.

477
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:56,680
But all things considered,
that's a tall order--

478
00:33:56,681 --> 00:34:00,798
for someone like you to
absolve someone like me.

479
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:04,191
They said you might come.

480
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:08,001
So you know who I am and why I'm here.

481
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,159
A mutual acquaintance of
ours gave you something

482
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,842
that belongs to me.

483
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:14,609
The red box.

484
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:20,137
Your powers of perception are
nothing short of divine.

485
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,251
He said you wouldn't be able
to enter this hallowed place.

486
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,690
Really, father?

487
00:34:30,897 --> 00:34:32,438
I love churches.

488
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,519
What did you do to me?

489
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:41,233
What did you do to me, damn it?

490
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:44,336
Nothing you didn't want.

491
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:45,882
I can't write.

492
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,103
My computer freezes. The
pens run out of ink.

493
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:50,731
The pencils break. My mind goes blank.

494
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:52,805
I tried to tell you, Brian.

495
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,133
The universe wants us to be together.

496
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,089
You write...

497
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:00,911
when you're with me.

498
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:05,371
You're blocked when you're with her.

499
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:09,478
That's not possible.

500
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,164
There's no connection. There--

501
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:18,995
You know you want me.

502
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:21,038
The writing is just the excuse.

503
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:44,265
Doctor's orders.

504
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:45,849
It'll help you relax.

505
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:02,417
Thank you.

506
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,480
My pleasure.

507
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:13,809
Miss van Veen,

508
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,700
if you'll come with me, please.

509
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:20,109
Wait. Where are you taking me?

510
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,084
- Someone wants to talk to you. 
- No!

511
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:23,938
Jane. Cooper.

512
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:25,074
Thanks, doc.

513
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:28,846
I don't even wanna know
how you pulled that off.

514
00:36:28,847 --> 00:36:31,556
Dr. Anton needed some help with a D.U.I.
last year.

515
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:38,062
I guess it pays to have
friends in high places.

516
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:40,070
Especially when they owe you favors.

517
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,145
Thank you for believing me.

518
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:45,722
Come on.

519
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,674
I'll take you home.

520
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:49,971
Okay.

521
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:57,935
I was the only one who knew it was suicide.

522
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:00,457
How did you know the truth about Sasha?

523
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,387
She told me.

524
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:08,341
Don't mock me, Mr. Shaw, not about this.

525
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:10,010
I'm not mocking you.

526
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,196
Your daughter is still alive.

527
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,480
Whether you hit me again or not,

528
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,872
it's the truth.

529
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:28,316
How dare you lie to me about my child.

530
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:32,170
You don't have to believe me,
but I promise you this--

531
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:36,441
after I'm gone, you're going to
wonder for the rest of your life

532
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:38,548
if I was telling the truth.

533
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:40,350
Yeah.

534
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:44,713
I know where she is.

535
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:46,295
Let me go.

536
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:48,655
I'll take you to her.

537
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,893
I think it's time we close the
deal with our friend Shaw.

538
00:38:14,614 --> 00:38:15,977
Alexis, come in.

539
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:17,495
A moment, please?

540
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,841
I'll wait outside.

541
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,262
What can I do for you?

542
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:29,998
I can't do this anymore, Gavin.

543
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:31,491
I feel terrible for him.

544
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:32,686
He's losing his mind.

545
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,974
Alexis, I've seen how you
light up with Brian.

546
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,809
Seems to me like you're enjoying
your little trysts as well.

547
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,853
You make a striking couple.

548
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:42,680
I can't deal with the guilt.

549
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:45,170
I know what you did for me,

550
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:48,786
but I-I'm not cut out to destroy people.

551
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,536
Well, you should've taken
your tender nature

552
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,630
into consideration first.

553
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:55,709
We all have to pay to play, my dear.

554
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:59,068
At least you've got company.

555
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:34,321
Oh, Henry.

556
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:42,455
Jane.

557
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,463
- Henry. 
- You're home.

558
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:46,203
I didn't know they were letting you out.

559
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:47,635
No one called me.

560
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:51,513
How did you get out of the hospital?

561
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:54,869
Uh, they just let me go. Um...

562
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,953
I just couldn't stay there anymore.

563
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,073
You feel all right?

564
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:02,018
Yeah.

565
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:03,632
I do now.

566
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:04,846
Good.

567
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:06,820
I love you, Jane.

568
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:09,867
I don't want anything to happen to you.

569
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:11,519
Me either.

570
00:40:36,305 --> 00:40:39,700
Oh, my God. I thought
you were gone forever.

571
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:40,992
It's okay. I'm, uh...

572
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:42,757
I'm okay.

573
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,439
Y-you went down the stairs,
and the mosaic closed.

574
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:49,251
I was freaking out.

575
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,839
Where did you go?

576
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,763
What did you see?

577
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,221
I don't know. I...

578
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:57,668
I can't remember anything.

579
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:03,653
I think I know someone who can help you.

580
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,055
Nona, who is this person?

581
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:17,080
Her name's Maris.

582
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:20,293
She knows things about the Drake.

583
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:24,820
I think she can help you remember.

584
00:41:28,763 --> 00:41:30,068
The only question is

585
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,641
can you handle it?

586
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:43,482
Will you come with me?

587
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:45,488
She doesn't exactly like company.

588
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:47,146
You have to go in alone.

589
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:55,567
Okay.

590
00:41:58,004 --> 00:41:59,348
Here goes nothing.

591
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:08,021
