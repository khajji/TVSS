1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,660
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,410
Henry!

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,710
I was right about henry. He's a hero.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,530
You've been watching me from your window.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,880
You need to leave.

6
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:15,939
Really?

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,650
What is that?

8
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,440
They were a fraternal brotherhood
called the Order of the Dragon.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,240
- Don't let him out.
- Who?

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,820
I get the feeling like the
dead won't stay dead.

12
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,540
We need to talk about what happened, Peter,

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,400
and that strange ritual.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,139
It was supposed to bring
us incredible wealth.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,430
It was a sham.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,200
How I wish that it had been.

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,540
There's blood on our hands.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,510
My God.

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,420
What did we do?

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,260
We invited evil into our homes.
That's what we did.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,540
I'm home.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,420
Daddy!

23
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,340
Happy Halloween.

24
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,870
You, too, dear.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,420
Honey, you're early.

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,730
Dinner will be ready in just a few minutes.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,280
What's wrong?

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,450
It was a bad day.

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,409
They closed down the firm.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,140
But I-I think I found a way out of it.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,750
I want you to know something, my dear.

32
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,560
In heaven,

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
you will be truly happy.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,510
What?

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,780
Peter, what's wrong with your eye?

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,540
Peter.

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,850
No. No.

38
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,920
No!

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,270
No!

40
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,630
No!

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,950
Keep it safe.

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,760
Keep it in the family. I love you.

43
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,169
The salmon tartar and the duck
terrine should be perfect.

44
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,210
Thank you.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,829
Oh, Marcel.

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,229
More candelabras, less cobwebs.

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,269
This is Halloween at the
Drake, not an amusement park.

48
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,110
Uh, spooky and also elegant.

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,430
- Okay?
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Doran.

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,739
Oh! Jane, thank God. I'm
late meeting Gavin.

51
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,909
Would you mind finishing
up the decorations?

52
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,278
Oh, Olivia, I would love to,

53
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,478
but Henry's "First Cup New
York" interview's in an hour,

54
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,970
and I'm heading over to
the studio to see him.

55
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,279
- TV?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,560
Just as my party could use
a little celebrity cache.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,279
I'm glad Henry's capitalizing on
the incident at the mayor's house.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,770
Very savvy.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,280
I think he's just enjoying his
moment in the spotlight, you know?

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,160
It's gonna be more than a moment, my dear.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,119
Well, I...the lobby is gonna look amazing.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,260
Really has that haunted house feel.

63
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,889
Too much on the cobwebs?

64
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,699
No. No.

65
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,970
I mean, Halloween's all
about excess, right?

66
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,840
I'll see you soon.

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,019
My guest in the studio is Henry Martin,

68
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,978
the man who saved commissioner Pike's life

69
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,060
and stopped a gunman

70
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,829
from hurting any more innocent
people at the mayor's house.

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,998
- Henry, hi.
- Hi.

72
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,510
Can you...can you take
us through that night?

73
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:52,880
What were you thinking?

74
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,079
Um, honestly, nothing.

75
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,770
No, it's true. I... I just reacted.

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,880
I think if I had time to think,

77
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:02,089
I'm...I'm pretty sure I
would've been terrified.

78
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,360
Oh, you know, I don't know about that.
You're a hero, Henry.

79
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,429
Uh, no. No, I'm not. I...

80
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,170
I think it was a case

81
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,640
of being in the right
place at the right time.

82
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,489
But I'm not a hero. I did
what anyone would've done.

83
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,549
Well, in this city, I'm
not so sure about that.

84
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,830
Here's the best part of the story.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,059
He's modest, handsome, and available.

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,169
That's right. No wedding ring, ladies.

87
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,770
You know, aside from
Derek Jeter, I bet that

88
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,310
you're the most eligible
bachelor in New York.

89
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,390
Uh, I... Henry Martin, thank
you so much for joining us.

90
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,939
And... we're out.

91
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,270
Okay. You know, I really
admire what you did.

92
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,109
Oh. Thank you. Yeah.

93
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,859
Um, and...and just for the record,

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,710
I have a girlfriend that I love very much.

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,568
The...the cute blonde waving
from behind the monitor.

96
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:43,930
Yeah. That's...that's her.

97
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,910
You know, it makes for a
better story if you're single.

98
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,780
You are good.

99
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,180
That was good.

100
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,239
Look at me. Just a small
town girl from Kokomo

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,749
kissing New York's most eligible bachelor.

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,038
I'm s...I'm sorry. Do I know you?

103
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,298
Apparently not, no.

104
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm so sorry. Look, I was
gonna say I have a girlfriend

105
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,649
before they...they cut to a commercial...

106
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,218
or whatever they do.

107
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,068
- You are so busted right now.
- I know.

108
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,050
I knew I'd screw it up.

109
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,788
That's the last interview I'm ever doing.

110
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,678
Then that would be the second stupid thing

111
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,840
you've said today.

112
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,310
That's actually not a bad
batting average for me.

113
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,919
Laurel Harris. I'm a media consultant.

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,770
- Hi. This is, uh...
- The girlfriend.

115
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,889
- Yes. Jane Van Veen. Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

116
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,269
Out of curiosity, what was the
other stupid thing I said?

117
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,700
Not saying you had a girlfriend?

118
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,570
No. Honestly, on that one, you got lucky.

119
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,050
You said, "I'm not a hero."

120
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,980
Now it's fine to be modest.

121
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,539
Humility can be a powerful tool.

122
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,169
But if you wanna use
this for political gain,

123
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,488
never let words come out of your mouth

124
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,890
that someone can use against you.

125
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,900
I'm sorry. You said "Political gain"?

126
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,260
I would...I think you have the wrong guy.

127
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,450
Do I?

128
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,999
No, I thought you worked
at the mayor's office.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Most people there have at least considered

130
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,300
what it would be like
to sit stop the throne.

131
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,250
You haven't?

132
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,920
Um, not in a serious way.

133
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,509
Okay. Fair enough.

134
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,109
I'm based in L.A., but I'm
in town for a few weeks.

135
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,210
If you change your mind, I'd
love to sit down and talk about

136
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,890
what our firm can do for you.

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,729
Um... I'm...I'm flattered, but I...

138
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm sorry. I'm just not really
understanding what you mean.

139
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,810
Before you know it, your
15 minutes will be up.

140
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,920
That's why I come in.

141
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:23,610
I can take your 15 minutes
and make it a lifetime.

142
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,660
Well, I went to four different stores,

143
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,499
but I finally found a costume.

144
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,720
It's old-school, and I think
you're gonna love it.

145
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,230
Oh, my God. Um, Brian...

146
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,050
This is Scott.

147
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,949
Uh, you're probably wondering

148
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,578
why I'm massaging your wife's stomach.

149
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,510
Yeah. An explanation would be nice.

150
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,189
Scott is a doctor. He
lives in our building.

151
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,060
4G. I've seen you in the elevator before.

152
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:54,140
You're the, uh, you're the big playwright.

153
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,220
I've done a little writing myself.
Well, in college.

154
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,039
So what's...what's going on, Lou? You okay?

155
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,520
Yeah. I think I just overdid it
a bit dancing the other night.

156
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,960
My ribs are super sore.

157
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,549
Dr. Scott was nice enough
to make a house call.

158
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,369
Oh. Well, thank you for that.
Uh, what's the verdict, doc?

159
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,479
She has a-a strained ab muscle.

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,669
- Oh. Okay.
- So no dancing for a few weeks.

161
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,959
Tonight's party, that's included.
You got me?

162
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,908
Deal. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

163
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,760
Buy me a drink tonight, and we're even.

164
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,120
All right. Well, thanks
again for coming by.

165
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,100
Um, wait. Uh, Dr. Scott?

166
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,619
Um, I'm feeling really uncomfortable.

167
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,940
I have to make it through
the whole party tonight.

168
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,590
Is there anything I should be taking? Or...

169
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,250
Tequila?

170
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,790
I'm kidding.

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,580
Ice it if it gets really bad.

172
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,420
Okay. Great.

173
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,440
Thank you.

174
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,999
He's nice, right?

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,509
He saw me wincing in the elevator.

176
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,470
He felt bad. He wanted to help me out.

177
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,430
He's cute, right?

178
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,070
Eh, he's not really my type.

179
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,429
For Alexis.

180
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,770
I think I'm gonna try to set
them up tonight at the party.

181
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,650
Alexis is gonna be at the party?

182
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,180
Oh. It's great.

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,410
Well, you know it's the party of the season

184
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,120
when "Page Six" asks for more invitations.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,689
Good publicity is priceless.

186
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,040
Well, speaking of good publicity,

187
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,709
Henry just got interviewed
for "First Cup New York."

188
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,050
I assumed he'd make the rounds.

189
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:38,760
Well, you sure know how to pick him.

190
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,160
Oh, hold on.

191
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,259
Oh, it's the caterer.

192
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,750
- Can you take this, hon?
- Yeah.

193
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,130
Okay, thanks.

194
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,200
Hello?

195
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,730
Yes.

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,700
No. No.

197
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,340
I'll take those, Mr. Doran.

198
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,120
Olivia!

199
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,290
- Hey, are you all right?
- Did you see that maniac?

200
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,219
He almost killed me.

201
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Yeah.

202
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,578
Okay, uh, we need to go.

203
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,518
The party starts in, like, now, Henry.

204
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,150
Oh, you've seen the look Olivia gives us

205
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,699
if we use the wrong salad fork.

206
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,259
Oh. I have no interest in
crossing that woman on Halloween.

207
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,630
You like my costume?

208
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,840
Sexy Devil?

209
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,329
Super hot.

210
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,050
And I definitely want credit
for the "Hot/devil" pun.

211
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,679
Ah, very witty. Now stop
talking, start undressing.

212
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,950
- We have to go, like, now.
- Wait a second. Time out.

213
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:15,209
I have a feeling our costumes
are already taken care of.

214
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,869
"A little something for your
first Halloween at the Drake."

215
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,019
Wow. It's like having our
very own fairy godmother.

216
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,159
Yeah, who lets herself
in whenever she wants.

217
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,270
What is this?

218
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,650
Oh, my God.

219
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,290
Are we required to wear these?

220
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,829
Nice costume.

221
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,239
Did I surprise you?

222
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,140
No. I'm just not used to you knocking.

223
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,330
Uh, Louise is in the shower.

224
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,610
Brian...

225
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
Can we talk for a second?

226
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,010
Sure.

227
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,040
I feel like I owe you an apology...

228
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,250
for everything.

229
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,660
I'm sorry for getting all psycho on you.

230
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,730
- I thought we had a connection and I...
- We don't.

231
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,530
Understood.

232
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,320
It was wrong of me to kiss you.

233
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:11,599
I-I was way out of line.

234
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,350
I really like Louise and
I need to keep my job.

235
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,850
Here.

236
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,570
From now on, I will stay out of your way.

237
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,110
Promise.

238
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
This is me coming clean.

239
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,880
Friends?

240
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,320
Yeah.

241
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,260
Fine.

242
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,910
Hey, Lou, Alexis is here!

243
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,110
I'll be right out!

244
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,710
So who is this sexy doctor
she's been telling me about?

245
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,109
You know, I think everyone is overstating

246
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,990
his level of attractiveness.

247
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,159
Jealous much?

248
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,100
Not really,

249
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,880
even though he was massaging her stomach.

250
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,439
Relax.

251
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,250
She's his patient. He's
examined her a bunch of times.

252
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,610
What? Didn't they just meet today?

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,190
You know what? Maybe I have it wrong.

254
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,410
Nah, come on.

255
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,310
How many times has he examined her?

256
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,430
I don't know. Uh, two or three?

257
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,900
Two or three.

258
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,790
She...she probably didn't tell you

259
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,610
because she didn't want you to worry.

260
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,220
Yeah.

261
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,140
There's a new sheriff in town, maybe?

262
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,178
I think that was Olivia's little joke.

263
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:43,758
And for the record,

264
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,548
I have no idea who you're supposed to be.

265
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,168
You know those starlings that attacked me

266
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,220
in Barlow's apartment?

267
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,910
I think I'm Tippi Hedren from "The Birds."

268
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,060
That's what I thought.

269
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,080
And I can't decide

270
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,968
whether that's really
cool or really creepy.

271
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:57,680
Well, It's Halloween.

272
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:00,020
I guess it's supposed
to be a little of both.

273
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,990
How you doing?

274
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,590
I dig the period suit.

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,120
First rule of a good
costume... comfort first.

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
I like your necklace.

277
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,790
Thank you.

278
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,310
Excuse me.

279
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,160
You coming?

280
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,130
No.

281
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,700
All right. Have a good night, partner.

282
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,430
I have to finish this.

283
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,548
A friend from the NYPD
advised me that those texts

284
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,960
were most likely sent from
a disposable cell phone.

285
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,330
They're not traceable.

286
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,230
Well, a man in your position
got a lot of enemies.

287
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:44,420
Any idea who?

288
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,570
Someone smart enough not
to challenge me head-on.

289
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,999
Security's vetting
everyone, even residents.

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,669
Masks off, presenting I.D.

291
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,030
If he, uh, tries anything, we're ready.

292
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,230
I'm, uh, I'm ready.

293
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,059
Don't shoot yourself.

294
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,389
I'll try not to.

295
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,570
Do you mind?

296
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure, yeah.

297
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,639
You you can trust me, Mr. Doran.

298
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,270
I do trust you, Tony.

299
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm trusting you with my
most-prized possession.

300
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,260
My wife.

301
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,930
During the party, I want
you to stick close to her.

302
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,900
She's the most valuable
thing in the world to me.

303
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,590
Things are getting crazy in the Drake!

304
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,228
Yeah, I feel like I'm at my parents house

305
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:50,860
and I don't want to break anything.

306
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:54,259
Oh, come on. Take a night off. Let's drink!

307
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,600
Aw, all right.

308
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,689
Oh! Ohh, no. Oh, shoot!

309
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,119
Oh, no. Your birds are soaked.

310
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,578
Well, you know, I guess that, uh

311
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,038
that gives me an excuse to change, right?

312
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,208
Oh, you know what? I'll come with you.

313
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:06,980
Yeah, me, too. Come on.

314
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,539
No, stop it. I'll be two seconds.

315
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,158
Enjoy yourself. I'll be right back.

316
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,790
- You sure?
- Yes. Yes. Enjoy it.

317
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,130
I'll be one sec.

318
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,060
Thank you.

319
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,300
Cheers. Mm-hmm.

320
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,360
I have to admit

321
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,460
I wish all my nurses looked as good as you.

322
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,770
I have a confession, too.

323
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,199
I've never actually played doctor
with a real doctor before.

324
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,300
Really?

325
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,880
Wow. They really look like
they're hitting it off, huh?

326
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,319
Yeah.

327
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,780
What kind of doctor is he again?

328
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,109
Surgeon, I think.

329
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,240
Obviously good with his hands.

330
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,269
I'm kidding.

331
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,260
Honey, you should've seen

332
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,439
the look on your face
when you walked in on us.

333
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,980
A stranger's hands on your stomach?

334
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,939
I mean, I think all things
considered, I was pretty cool.

335
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,419
Hardly a stranger. Honey,
he's been really great.

336
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,270
He's come by whenever I needed him.

337
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,560
So today wasn't the first time?

338
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,279
No. Uh, we met a few weeks ago. Why?

339
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,079
Uh, earlier, when you said that
he saw you in the elevator,

340
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,380
I just assumed that, uh,
you met this morning.

341
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,699
Okay. I should come clean.

342
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,438
We've been having a scandalous affair,

343
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,050
and now that I've had my fun with him,

344
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,929
I thought maybe I should
pass him off to Alexis.

345
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,170
Brian, look,

346
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,680
my ribs have been killing me, okay?

347
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,360
I didn't want to worry you.

348
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,420
Besides, honey, do you honestly
think I would ever cheat on you?

349
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,090
No. I'm sorry.

350
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,190
Let's get some more tequila,

351
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:52,130
'cause I may not be able
to dance, but I can drink.

352
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,280
Done.

353
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,210
Okay.

354
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,110
What do you want?

355
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,100
What is it, sweetheart?

356
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,710
He got out.

357
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,910
Who got out?

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,190
Daddy.

359
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,200
"Family tragedy.

360
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,930
"Man kills wife,

361
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,170
girl survives rampage."

362
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,510
"Jocelyn."

363
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,520
Daddy?

364
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,870
Oh, my God.

365
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,250
Peter...

366
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,750
Kramer.

367
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,589
Excuse me. Aren't you that guy

368
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,619
that stopped the gunman
at the mayor's mansion?

369
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,350
Uh, yeah, but it's not a big deal.

370
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,420
Of course it is.

371
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,280
Why else would I be here?

372
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,770
- Laurel.
- Laurel. Right.

373
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,068
Hi. How are you?

374
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,608
What are you... what are you doing here?

375
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,360
Our New York office always receives

376
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,930
invites to the Dorans' parties.

377
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,639
Here's some free advice, Henry...

378
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,139
being modest on TV makes
you look appealing.

379
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,330
Being too modest in person
makes you seem weak.

380
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,889
Don't downplay what you've done.

381
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,279
I'm not downplaying.

382
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,349
And for the record, I am not buying

383
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,879
that "Aw, shucks" attitude.

384
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,269
I think that behind your midwestern smile,

385
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,920
you are as driven as our eminent host.

386
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,839
So where is your fiancee?

387
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,799
Uh, girlfriend. Jane. She had to go change.

388
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,778
Don't you think it's time
that you take the next step

389
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,520
before you really do earn the title

390
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,609
of New York's most eligible bachelor?

391
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,870
I think we're okay with
how things are right now.

392
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,518
Spoken like every man who's
ever lived to the women

393
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,400
he had no intention of proposing to her.

394
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,179
Oh, no. I...

395
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,220
I definitely want to marry her.

396
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,800
She doesn't?

397
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,200
No. She...

398
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,580
- She doesn't.
- She does,

399
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,629
I do, just not at this moment.

400
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,129
If you really love her,
I'd seal the deal now,

401
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,729
before the concrete
jungle drives you apart.

402
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,780
Well, that won't happen.

403
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,040
Well, New York changes people.

404
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,820
Not Jane and not me.

405
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,340
We'll see.

406
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,910
So it looked like you and
Alexis were having a good time.

407
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,610
You okay?

408
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,319
Yeah. I-I think I tweaked something.

409
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,660
It's really hurting, actually.

410
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,820
Well, did you take anything?

411
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:29,590
Just aspirin.

412
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,210
I think I need something a little stronger.

413
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,100
Please?

414
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,819
Okay. Come on.

415
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,930
I'll take another look at you.

416
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,309
Ladies, let me introduce you

417
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,809
to apartment 5F,

418
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,569
where one of the first
residents of the Drake,

419
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,089
Peter Kramer,

420
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:13,340
murdered his wife with a hatchet
on Halloween night in 1929.

421
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,189
I should head back downstairs.

422
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,240
My husband'll send out a search party.

423
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,159
Well, I guess it's just the two of us.
Shall we?

424
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,209
You didn't really expect me to be scared.

425
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,260
I bet you one SPA day at exhale

426
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,279
you can't last five minutes
inside this apartment alone.

427
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,750
Oh, five minutes? You're on.

428
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,650
Peter...

429
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,340
Kramer...

430
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Drake.

431
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,460
Henry?

432
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,810
Oh, my God.

433
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,159
You're Peter Kramer.

434
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,920
You're not real.

435
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,700
Oh, my God.

436
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,990
Oh, my God! No! No!

437
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,538
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

438
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:57,730
Um, can I please borrow your phone?

439
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,930
- It's an emergency.
- Uh, yeah.

440
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,880
Thank you so much. Thank you.

441
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,229
9-1-1.

442
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,408
Yes. Yes, hello.

443
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:07,790
Um, somebody broke into my
apartment and attacked me.

444
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,879
Uh, the address is 999 park avenue.

445
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,850
It's called the Drake.
Somebody's trying to kill me.

446
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,550
- Oh, my God. Are you all right?
- Look out!

447
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,090
No!

448
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,350
Sorry. That scared me.

449
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,820
You think that was supposed to happen?

450
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,670
I don't think so.

451
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,880
I gotta find Jane.

452
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,360
I have your wife, Mr. Doran.

453
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,198
Name your price.

454
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:03,070
What makes you think I'm after money?

455
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,959
Joy playing games with people's lives.

456
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,219
How does it feel to be on the other end?

457
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,300
If you know what I'm
capable of, why push me?

458
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,420
To let you know you're not invulnerable.

459
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,649
If you hurt her...

460
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,869
That depends entirely on you,

461
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,090
and if you can find her in time.

462
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,720
Where is Olivia?

463
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:29,210
She went to show her friends apartment 5F.

464
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,640
Get up to the penthouse.

465
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:34,480
- See if she shows up there.
- Yeah, all right.

466
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,210
Alexis. Hey.

467
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,169
What the hell is going on with Louise?

468
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,340
What do you mean? Nothing.

469
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:54,010
I just watched her leave with Dr. Scott.

470
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,980
So?

471
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,029
So why the hell would she leave a party

472
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,840
in the middle without even telling me?

473
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:01,330
I'm sure there is an explanation.

474
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,079
Check your apartment.

475
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,859
She's probably up there.

476
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,410
Alone.

477
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,329
Hello?

478
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,078
Please get us the hell out of here!

479
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,360
Can somebody get us out of this elevator?

480
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:33,469
Louise. Stop. It's not gonna help.

481
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,520
Look, I-I-I just have to get
off this elevator. Okay?

482
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:38,849
Can, you, um, can you call 9-1-1?
I left my phone upstairs.

483
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,829
Hello?

484
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,310
Actually, where is my phone?

485
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,939
- Oh, God.
- Louise, look at...

486
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,760
Someone, please. Hello?

487
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,269
Louise! Stop.

488
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,439
Okay, look at me. Calm... down.

489
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,408
Okay, look, I-I have to
get off this elevator.

490
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:50,128
You don't understand.

491
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:51,590
This thing tried to kill me before, okay?

492
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:52,920
Take a deep breath.

493
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,340
- Got it?
- Yeah.

494
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,020
You know, the way you were
pounding on that door,

495
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,380
it doesn't seem like your ribs
are bothering you at all.

496
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:03,749
Maybe the adrenaline blocked the pain.

497
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,710
Louise, I'm not stupid.

498
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,610
I know what's going on.

499
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,160
I've examined you three times, Louise,

500
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,740
and there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you,

501
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,960
except... you need more pills.

502
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,150
Lou?

503
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,530
Lou, are you up here?

504
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,990
Louise?

505
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,690
Mrs. D? You in here?

506
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,840
Hello?

507
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,980
Olivia?

508
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,690
Tony.

509
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,669
Help.

510
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,230
Wait. Wait.

511
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,240
Where is Olivia?

512
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,770
I don't know. He got into the safe.

513
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,470
You want me to call the cops?

514
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,580
No.

515
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,330
Go down to the party and
check on the guests.

516
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,310
Okay.

517
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,740
Olivia?

518
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,300
Honey.

519
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,180
Where am I?

520
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,430
You are on our terrace.

521
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,270
Why are you smiling?

522
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,440
Because I was worried
when I couldn't find you.

523
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,370
I don't know what happened.

524
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,580
What's the last thing you remember?

525
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,960
I was with the girls,

526
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,010
and then it's foggy.

527
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,460
Is everything okay?

528
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,080
Yes, everything is fine.

529
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,730
Oh, oh, my head is spinning.

530
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:00,750
Oh. Here. You're freezing.
Come on. Let's go in.

531
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,769
No abuse.

532
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,089
No childhood trauma.

533
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,509
Just a classic club kid hooked on speed

534
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,490
because I was stupid.

535
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,520
But you quit 'cause you're so smart.

536
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:15,500
Well, not smart.

537
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,560
Scared.

538
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,580
One night...

539
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,159
Let's just say I hit rock bottom.

540
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,809
I went to rehab and I haven't
done any pills since...

541
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,510
since lately.

542
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,110
Look, Brian doesn't know
anything about this. Okay?

543
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,550
I-I don't want him to find out either.

544
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,260
Thank you.

545
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,698
You do realize that it's
not just your run-in

546
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:43,688
with the elevator that's
causing your relapse?

547
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:45,970
Are you suggesting that because
my life isn't perfect,

548
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,439
I'm self-medicating?

549
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,420
Usually, there's... there's something more.

550
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,459
How are things with Brian?

551
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,950
Fine.

552
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,230
They're fine.

553
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,790
Good.

554
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,340
You know, if you need someone to talk to...

555
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,140
Thanks.

556
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,249
Whoa! What was that about?

557
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,420
I'm sorry. Sorry.

558
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,650
- Sorry. I guess I misread your signals.
- Yes.

559
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,430
- Sorry.
- I... I love my husband.

560
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:22,789
Weren't you just flirting
with my assistant?

561
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,989
The two of you seemed pretty steamy.

562
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,540
Yeah.

563
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,990
You're way more screwed up than I am.

564
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,920
Jane?

565
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,989
Hello?

566
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,378
I hope you don't mind me tagging along.

567
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:50,690
I'm just a little freaked out.

568
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,260
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

569
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,589
Hello?

570
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,539
Henry.

571
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,278
Jane, I've been looking all over for you.

572
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:03,508
Somebody attacked me

573
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:05,038
and chased me through the building.

574
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,130
Jane, where are you?

575
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,119
Fifth floor. North wing.

576
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,290
Please hurry. He's trying to kill me.

577
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,330
Call the police.

578
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,720
No. No.

579
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,289
Please.

580
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,649
Please don't do this!

581
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,279
Don't be afraid.

582
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,849
P-Peter, right?

583
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,090
Why are you doing this?

584
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,890
I have to save you.

585
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,719
Save me? W...

586
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,860
I have to do this.

587
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:57,089
Please. Please. I'm not...
I'm not who you think I am.

588
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,760
So...so will you just let me go?

589
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,020
I want you to know something, dear.

590
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,690
In heaven,

591
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,480
You're going to be truly happy.

592
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,200
Shh. Jane. Jane, it's me.

593
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,259
It's me. It's me. It's me.

594
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,190
Oh! I got you. Oh.

595
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,540
Con Ed is working

596
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,779
to get the power back on in the building.

597
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,109
Everybody, return to your apartments.
Clear the lobby.

598
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,469
The man who gave me his phone
was wearing a devil costume.

599
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,730
He was trying to help.

600
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,319
We've got people looking for him.

601
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,229
Well, there was a lot of blood.

602
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,179
He... he wouldn't have made it.

603
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,720
- Jane, it's not your fault.
- No.

604
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:12,700
What about the killer? Uh, give
me any kind of description?

605
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,780
No, I-I-I mean, I-I didn't see his face.

606
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,719
Once the power went out,
people got a little nervous.

607
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,050
But nothing out of the ordinary happened.

608
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,119
Calm down.

609
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,220
I am sure that text was a joke.

610
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,390
And not a good one.

611
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:40,770
Louise would never cheat on you.

612
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,970
Son of a bitch.

613
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,470
Brian, what the hell?!

614
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:55,799
Leave me alone.

615
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,050
Hey, where are you going?

616
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,199
Let him cool off. He's
been drinking all night.

617
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,690
Brian!

618
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,379
You have no idea what you've stolen.

619
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,429
Oh, but I do.

620
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,619
Return the box before it's
too late for both of us.

621
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,150
That will never happen.

622
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,019
This isn't over.

623
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,560
Whoever you are, wherever you are,

624
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,490
I'm coming for you.

625
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:36,494
