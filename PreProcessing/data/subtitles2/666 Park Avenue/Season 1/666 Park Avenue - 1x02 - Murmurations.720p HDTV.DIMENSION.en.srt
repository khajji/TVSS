1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,027
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"666 Park Avenue"...</i>

2
00:00:03,081 --> 00:00:04,247
Nice digs.

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,200
We have an interview.
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.

4
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:07,534
For the manager position.
Welcome.

5
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:09,870
Mr. Doran likes to approve
every tenant himself.

6
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:12,673
Obviously, whatever you guys
said won him over.

7
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,541
She's how we get Henry.

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,210
What happened
to the previous manager?

9
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:19,313
Why would anybody
ever want to leave this?

10
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:20,397
I'm Louise.

11
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:21,849
I think you met
my husband Brian.

12
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:23,067
Kind of nerdy cute.

13
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,236
Hey, honey,
come meet my new assistant.

14
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,188
Brian, this is Alexis.

15
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:28,355
Can you believe it?

16
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:29,723
She lives right across
the street, actually.

17
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,991
Washer number three is leaking.

18
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,526
Anything else I should know?

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,777
Well, there's a thief
in the building.

20
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:34,895
I'll keep an eye out.

21
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:36,330
I like your necklace.

22
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:37,748
It's not right what you do.

23
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:40,167
What I do is fulfill needs.

24
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:41,202
Oh!

25
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:42,586
Oh, my God. Aah!

26
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:44,238
You signed
a binding contract.

27
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:45,589
Now it's time to settle up.

28
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:48,209

Wait. I-I don't understand.

47
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,999
Barlow used to live here,
now he doesn't.

48
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,334
It's not that complicated.

49
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:57,003
No, I mean, why didn't he
tell me he was moving out?

50
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,304
Well, you've been here,
like, a week.

51
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:59,740
Why would he tell you anything?

52
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,575
Because I'm the new manager.
I'm supposed to get told.

53
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:05,445
And besides, people don't
just up and move like that.

54
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,599
I mean, there's paperwork
to fill out, I-I-I think.

55
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,268
Mr. Doran took care
of the paperwork.

56
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,719
He and Barlow, they got close

57
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,871
after the guy's wife took
her high dive off bellevue.

58
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,006
This right here,
this is just a...

59
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:17,324
it's a favor for him,
all right?

60
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:18,442
Sure. Great.

61
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:24,859
Where's all this being shipped?

62
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,143
Vegas.

63
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,878
Help me, uh, count the boxes.

64
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,363
Sure.

65
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:35,686
What'd you get?

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,904
Uh, 23.

67
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:38,372
Me, too.

68
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,907
I got a lot of work
to do on this place.

69
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,393
Gotta resurface the floors, redo the kitchen...

70
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:43,811
Install new fixtures,

71
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:46,013
and we should really look at
some of those sconces as w...

72
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,114
yeah.

73
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:48,299
Now?

74
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,316
Sconces.

75
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,451
All right. I'll be down
in a minute.

76
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,503
The, uh, party planner
and her entourage

77
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:53,938
have arrived.

78
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:56,023
It's gonna be quite the soiree
tonight at the Dorans.

79
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,374
I'm looking forward to it.

80
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,009
Hmm.

81
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,278
Oh, sorry, Tony.
You weren't invited?

82
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:03,264
Oh, no, actually, I, uh,
I got a prior engagement.

83
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:04,815
Oh. Yeah.

84
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,950
Right. Yeah.

85
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,051
Of course.

86
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,552
All right. Take it easy.

87
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,700
Aah! Aah!

89
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:57,885
Hey.

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,986
Tony, Barlow's apartment,

91
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,187
there are birds in the walls.

92
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:01,289
Uh, it's an old building.

93
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:02,490
Probably lots of things
in the walls.

94
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,025
They flew right out of the wall

95
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:05,326
and broke through
a window upstairs.

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,595
We gotta call an exterminator.
This is serious.

97
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,931
Yeah, yeah, look, look,
I got one elevator down,

98
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:11,265
and it's making
my life miserable.

99
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,868
I need it fixed today.

100
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:16,270
Yeah, yeah, it's the one
that almost ate that lady.

101
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,005
Yeah, that one. All right.

102
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,075
I sent Louise flowers
from all of us, by the way.

103
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,376
Of course you did.

104
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:26,113
This is the exterminator
we use.

105
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:28,816
You're the resident manager,
you call.

106
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,986
Thanks, Tony.
I'll take care of it.

107
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,655
You know, Tony, uh, by the way,

108
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,657
I didn't take the job
from you, okay?

109
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,359
Mr. Doran hired us.

110
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,227
Oh, I know that, Jane.

111
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:42,830
Thanks.

112
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,999
Oh, Nona, hey.

113
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,417
What's up?

114
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,652
You mentioned that there's
a thief in the building.

115
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,255
I... well, it looks like
I'm the latest victim.

116
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,340
Oh, no.

117
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:54,125
Yeah, uh, my...
my grandmother's necklace.

118
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,093
It's irreplaceable.

119
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:57,828
I'll keep an eye out.

120
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,714
Thanks.

121
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,849
Hey, Jane.

122
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,667
Don't mess with the birds.

123
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:07,054
They're part of the Drake.

124
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:22,320
Hey. Just talked
to the doctor a...

125
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:25,189
here. What are you doing?
Let me help.

126
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,324
All right. Let me help.

127
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,076
I'm not an invalid, Brian.

128
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,662
No, but you're still
on the mend.

129
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:33,497
Mending is really boring.

130
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,499
You gotta stop complaining.

131
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,884
You know, the doctor thinks

132
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,535
that you only have to be here
a few more nights.

133
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:39,720
What?

134
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:40,838
That is not a long time

135
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:43,057
for a girl that got crushed
by an elevator.

136
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,142
And...

137
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:47,378
Honestly, babe, uh,
a collapsed lung

138
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:50,431
and a concussion
are really serious.

139
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:52,316
So are some of
the bills we have.

140
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:54,051
I can't get out there
and land a job

141
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:55,403
until I get out of here.

142
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,405
You still have that one gig.

143
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,057
Actually, they said they weren't
gonna hire me again.

144
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:02,126
That's ridiculous, Lou.

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,727
You were in an accident.

146
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:06,230
Oh, they know. They sent those.

147
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,667
Look, they're
vindictive fashionistas

148
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,952
who were inconvenienced.

149
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,788
Yeah, it sucks.

150
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,573
Actually,
will you get the nurse?

151
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:17,908
My Vicodin's wearing off.

152
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,627
Yeah, sure.

153
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,078
I'm back.

154
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,516
Alexis, thank God.

155
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,767
Oh, thank you.

156
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,886
Now this
is how you save a life.

157
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,723
How are you?

158
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:33,774
Uh, I'm fine.

159
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,385
Is that stuff
from our apartment?

160
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,430
Almost forgot.

161
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,904
Here you go. Here's your key.

162
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:51,685
I'm late.

163
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:53,767
I know. I'm sorry.

164
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,085
Whoa.

165
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,419
Wow. You look stunning.

166
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,105
Hey, thanks
for getting the wine.

167
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,756
Of course, of course.

168
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,258
So you wouldn't believe
this guy in the wine shop.

169
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:04,394
He was trying to push
an $800 bottle of wine on me.

170
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:06,613
Have you ever heard of
Chateau Monique? No.

171
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:08,198
Yeah, well, he couldn't believe
I hadn't heard of it either.

172
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,733
But you'll be happy to know,

173
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,152
I held firm on a bottle
of Merlot for 20 bucks.

174
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:14,238
That's what the Dorans use
in their salad dressing.

175
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:15,956
I'm gonna
hop in the shower.

176
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,274
I'm funny.

177
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:18,709
How was your day?

178
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:19,893
What, you didn't get my text?

179
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:21,929
The one about you
being attacked by birds?

180
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,630
That wasn't
an autocorrect mistake?

181
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,166
No. I got, like,
tippi hedren attacked.

182
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,901
They flew right out of the wall

183
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,253
of an apartment upstairs.

184
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:30,504
It was crazy.

185
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,807
And I still can't figure out
where they came from.

186
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,292
Did you provoke 'em?

187
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:36,843
No, I didn't provoke them.

188
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:38,912
I know how you are, Jane.
Get in the shower.

189
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:39,896
I love you.

190
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:02,921
Mwah.

191
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,940
Jane, Henry, there you are.

192
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:07,276
I'm sorry we're late.
It's my fault.

193
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,393
Oh, Olivia, this is amazing.

194
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,012
Here. Uh, for you and Gavin.

195
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,513
Oh, how thoughtful.

196
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,698
Help yourself to a drink.

197
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:14,933
The bar is straight ahead.

198
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,935
Uh, Adriana. E-excuse me.

199
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:19,204
I love your dress.

200
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,706
Uh, what do you want to drink?

201
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,191
Uh, something with vodka,
please.

202
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,308
Okay.

203
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,315
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle.

204
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,850
She lives in the building. Hey.

205
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,018
Hi. Nice to meet you.

206
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,586
Hi. The Sushi's excellent,
by the way.

207
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,737
Oh, yeah?

208
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,072
I was just telling
your lovely wife...

209
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,207
oh.

210
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,258
Um...

211
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:55,993
Not your wife?

212
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,177
Yes, lovely.

213
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:58,262
Uh, no, not married.

214
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,329
Oh, well, not yet.

215
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:00,981
I can tell Henry is a keeper.

216
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,683
Well, I like to think so.

217
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,867
Thank you, darling.

218
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:05,068
Thank you.

219
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:15,078
Go on in, take a look.

220
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:25,350
32 stories tall,
just off the West Side highway

221
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,485
at 43rd street...

222
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,286
condos and office space.

223
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:30,322
Looks impressive. It will be.

224
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:31,557
It's just a steel frame now.

225
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,775
These guys are in some kind
of financing squeeze.

226
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,410
They're desperate to get out.

227
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:38,664
The Alpern development group.
You probably heard about it.

228
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:39,915
Alpern, yeah,
it sounds familiar.

229
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,351
I'm picking this project up
for a song...

230
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:45,036
lands, construction costs,
air rights... all of it.

231
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:46,355
Uh, if... if you don't mind
me asking,

232
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,073
what's a song go for
these days?

233
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,675
$100 million.

234
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:54,046
That stays between us.

235
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,748
Uh, yeah, of course.

236
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,769
Hey. There you are.

237
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:11,956
I was just inside
talking to Gavin.

238
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:14,225
Whew.

239
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,376
Mm-hmm.

240
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,443
Wow.

241
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:19,814
Yeah.
Can you believe this view?

242
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,816
I could get used to it.

243
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,117
Hmm.

244
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:25,303
Well, enjoy it while you can.

245
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,606
We turn back into pumpkins
at midnight.

246
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,058
You've met
our new building managers?

247
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,793
Oh, hi, Gavin.

248
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:50,262
You caught me staring.

249
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:51,513
Yes, they're very nice.

250
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:52,731
Mm.

251
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,349
You here with someone?

252
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,918
Like a date? No.

253
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,603
I find that hard to believe.

254
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,088
It's not for lack of trying.

255
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,506
Mm.

256
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,992
"Finding love makes it worth
the pain of searching for it."

257
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,561
Someone said that to me once.

258
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,452
They never tried
Internet dating.

259
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:13,939
Mm. Actually, I'm going out
with someone tomorrow night.

260
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,609
Magic could happen...
In theory.

261
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,611
There's a restaurant
in the flatiron district

262
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,113
that's very romantic.

263
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,531
I'll call the maitre d'.

264
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,216
He'll take care of you
and your gentleman.

265
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,600
That's nice, Gavin.

266
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:25,702
Thanks.

267
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:27,086
Never hurts to stack the deck.

268
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:40,384
Henry.

269
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,485
Hmm?

270
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,104
I think I left the clothes
in the dryer.

271
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,606
Why not tomorrow?

272
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:50,094
Because there's a thief
in the building.

273
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:04,358

Oh, my God.

293
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,977
I got 15 minutes
to get downtown.

294
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,329
Have you seen my black socks
anywhere, babe?

295
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,182
Yeah, did you check
the, uh, laundry basket?

296
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,234
Um, I... did I? Of course.

297
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:21,604
You know, I'm thinking red

298
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:25,412
is a really nice contrast
with the green skin tone

299
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,813
you have going on this morning.

300
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:28,615
Yeah, well, for the record,
I feel much worse on the inside.

301
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:29,750
Mm.

302
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,051
All right. I love you.

303
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,152
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,420
I forgot to mention, I, uh,

305
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,739
kind of invited the Dorans
to dinner tomorrow night.

306
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,608
I'm sorry. You kind of what?

307
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:38,925
Look, Jane, it's not like
we can afford to take 'em out.

308
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,060
And you're an amazing cook,
Jane.

309
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:41,461
Oh, Henry, I have to cook
for billionaires?

310
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:43,430
Fine. If you want me
to cancel, I will.

311
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,965
I'll just tell 'em I was drunk.

312
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,317
You so totally owe me.

313
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:49,052
I so totally owe you.

314
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:52,272
I hate to, but I'm gonna late.

315
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,658
You're the best.

316
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,261
One elevator is still down.

317
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,663
We're just waiting
on final inspection.

318
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:03,793
Well, use the freight elevator
if you're in a hurry.

319
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,827
Yeah. All right.
Have a good day.

320
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:09,480
15 calls, same question.

321
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:12,700
Hey, Tony, uh, you ever
hear about a murder

322
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,335
that happened at the Drake?

323
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:16,654
A murder? Um... Uh, no, no.

324
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,923
There's been a few suicides
over the years,

325
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,191
and a bunch of...
bunch of accidents.

326
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,292
You know, one guy...

327
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:22,610
one guy actually fell out
his own window.

328
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:23,695
Idiot.

329
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:25,930
But, uh... But no murders

330
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,031
that I can recollect, no.

331
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,116
Oh.

332
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,267
Why do you want to know
about a murder?

333
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:30,568
J-just wondering.

334
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,069
You're kind of creepy,
aren't you?

335
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:33,554
What? No.

336
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:35,039
Yeah, you are. I can tell.

337
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:36,090
Your guy's here.

338
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,127
I'm the exterminator.

339
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:41,279
No kidding.

340
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:44,201
Want to take a look?

341
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,405
It's an old ventilation shaft.

342
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:49,769
Wow.

343
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,950
It's not on any of
the drawings I have.

344
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,501
This kind of brick here...

345
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,086
part of
the original construction.

346
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,654
Look down.

347
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,510
Oh, my God.
There's hundreds of them.

348
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:11,282
Starlings.

349
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,301
Biggest nesting murmuration
I've ever seen in a building.

350
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,436
What?

351
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,088
Murmuration.

352
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,707
It's what you call starlings.
Collectively, I mean.

353
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:23,511
You know, like, uh,
a gaggle of geese,

354
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:26,413
a kit of pigeons,

355
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:27,748
a murder of crows.

356
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,366
There's lots of names
for birds.

357
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,168
My personal favorite...

358
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:34,321
an exaltation of larks.

359
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:35,639
That should keep 'em
in the hole.

360
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,891
So, uh, what do you think?
Can you get rid of 'em?

361
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:39,510
Shouldn't be a problem.

362
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,562
I'll kill 'em all.

363
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,249
Jane, hey.

364
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,802
Brian, hey, uh, we're having
a small ventilation issue

365
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:21,203
in the building.

366
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:22,972
Uh, we're checking apartments
on every floor. Can we...

367
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:24,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

368
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,875
Great. Do what you gotta do.

369
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:27,843
There's a couple of birds
stuck in an air shaft.

370
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:29,362
It's nothing.

371
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,163
Oh.

372
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,364
You good? Mm-hmm.

373
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:33,632
Okay.

374
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,601
So, uh, so how's
Louise feeling?

375
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,236
Uh, bored to death.

376
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,954
You know,
but other than that, better.

377
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,472
Good. I'm gonna visit tomorrow.

378
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,174
She'd love the company.

379
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,143
You know, Brian,
your apartment is... is so cool.

380
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,578
I love the photographs.

381
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:47,513
Yeah, that's all Lou.
She's got the style.

382
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:52,568
My contribution is the, uh,
messy area... there.

383
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:55,054
So how's the play coming?

384
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,589
I-I thought I closed
those curtains.

385
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:04,376
Mm. Yeah, lots of, uh,
lots of distractions, huh?

386
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,445
Uh, I-I, uh,

387
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,797
I keep them closed
when I... when I write.

388
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,082
Looks good here.

389
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,300
Wall's solid.

390
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,552
Okay. Uh, Brian,
thanks for everything.

391
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,620
Sure.

392
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,804
Okay.

393
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,072
All right. Uh, see you around.

394
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,953
Oh.

395
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,406
If they ventilated
down this far,

396
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,358
the air shaft should be
behind this wall.

397
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,061
Yeah, except there's no way
to access it.

398
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,245
There is.

399
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,932
Someone covered up
a door right here.

400
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,068
A door?

401
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,769
Hey, you ever consider,

402
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,272
whoever covered this door
with concrete

403
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,507
might have had
a good reason to do it?

404
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:57,296
There could be
a lot of reasons.

405
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,932
I still want you
to demo that wall.

406
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,402

Let me buy you

415
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:36,590
You were right. It's...
it's very romantic here.

416
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,075
It's not a good place
to sit alone.

417
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,761
Alone seems to be a running
theme in my life lately.

418
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,381
I'm having a drink with
a friend. Come and join us.

419
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,649
I'm gonna go home.

420
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:49,568
Well... he was hoping
to meet you.

421
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:56,592
One drink.

422
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:57,743
One drink.

423
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:03,816
Hi there. Frank Alpern.

424
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,900
Danielle.

425
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:06,435
Pleasure to meet you. You too.

426
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:07,753
Join us for a drink?

427
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:09,822
Sure.

428
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:21,342
You gonna kill the birds?

429
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:24,295
Jeez.  You scared me.

430
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,414
You shouldn't be doing that.

431
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,915
Uh...

432
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:30,751
I'm just helping 'em
find a new home.

433
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,021
You're gonna make them upset.

434
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,889
You know, uh,

435
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:37,358
I don't usually work
with an audience.

436
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,314
Whatever.

437
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:14,785
Oh, my God.

438
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,253
Thank you so much
for getting me lunch.

439
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:17,521
You're welcome.

440
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:18,956
Uh, so you're, uh,
you're feeling better?

441
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,026
Better. Honestly,
it could've been so much worse.

442
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,828
I mean, if Brian hadn't
been there...

443
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,062
I-I know.

444
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:26,864
I mean, you're lucky, I guess.

445
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:28,432
They ever figure out
what happened?

446
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:32,203
Uh, well, we had the elevators
inspected yesterday.

447
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:35,639
Um... but they couldn't
find anything wrong.

448
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:38,275
All the safety mechanisms
seem to be working.

449
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,410
So what does that mean?

450
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:40,644
Clearly, there's an issue.

451
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,646
I-I'm gonna talk
to Gavin about it.

452
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:45,520
That thing was possessed.

453
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:48,289
I swear, it felt like
it was trying to kill me.

454
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,224
Someone else
is gonna get hurt, Jane.

455
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,460
It's gonna happen.

456
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:55,330
What's this? A... a lawyer?

457
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:56,597
He's a personal injury
attorney.

458
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:57,932
He thinks I have a real case.

459
00:22:57,966 --> 00:22:59,600
You're gonna sue Gavin?

460
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,002
I'm strongly considering it.

461
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,437
I'm missing out on work.

462
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:04,372
I've... I've lost a lot of money
because of this accident.

463
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:08,778
I don't know.
We have some serious bills.

464
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:10,213
I-I'm sorry, Louise.

465
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,582
I-I probably shouldn't get
in the middle of this. Uh...

466
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,584
Right.

467
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,619
Anyway, I should probably go.

468
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:18,288
Um, I gotta go
to the grocery store

469
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:20,090
then home to cook dinner, so...

470
00:23:20,124 --> 00:23:22,225
Oh, just you and Henry
tonight, huh?

471
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,562
Yeah. Yeah, just me and, uh,
me and Henry.

472
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,030
Sweet.

473
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,201
Oh!

474
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,335
God, I'm sorry.

475
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,603
Oops.

476
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:36,005
Where are you guys off to
all dressed up?

477
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,108
Oh, someone has
a big night out.

478
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:39,843
It's an excuse to go shopping.

479
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,911
I kind of
met someone last night.

480
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:43,113
Well, that's great.

481
00:23:43,147 --> 00:23:44,180
I'll let you know
what happens.

482
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,482
When you see
what she's gonna be wearing,

483
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:46,950
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

484
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,719
Fingers crossed.

485
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,434
Nona?

486
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,790
"1956."

487
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,292
What the hell?

488
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:35,595
"The victim, Edward Paxton,

489
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,263
"a longtime resident
of the Drake,

490
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,634
"was found murdered

491
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:44,170
The killer remains at large."

492
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:50,440
Hey, babe.

493
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:51,792
Hey, the Dorans are gonna
be here any minute.

494
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,293
Uh, start chopping.

495
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:54,795
Did you get my text?

496
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:56,046
Um, yes.

497
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,648
So, yeah, what,
you... you had a dream

498
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,684
someone was murdered
at the Drake, and it came true?

499
00:25:00,718 --> 00:25:01,802
No. Well, yes.

500
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:02,953
Okay, I-I found an article

501
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:05,439
about a guy who was
killed here in 1956.

502
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,057
And it turns out it was

503
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,492
the same guy
that was in my dream.

504
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:10,460
But I had the dream
before I read about it.

505
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:11,895
Explain that to me.

506
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,129
Memory is unreliable,

507
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:15,198
and our brain
mixes things up all the time.

508
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:16,333
Nope, not mine
and not about that.

509
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,902
Okay, so you're clairvoyant.

510
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,474
So answer me this...

511
00:25:21,508 --> 00:25:23,476
am I getting fired?

512
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,561
Okay, what?

513
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:28,931
I shouldn't even
be telling you this.

514
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:32,752
It... it sounds like you should
be telling me this.

515
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:34,670
Okay, so the other night
when we were at the Dorans,

516
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:37,073
Gavin showed me
this building that he's buying.

517
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:38,591
It's $100 million.

518
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,459
Oh, my God. They're gonna hate
my pot roast.

519
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:41,561
Babe, focus.

520
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:42,678
Sorry. What?

521
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,447
Okay, so I found out at work
that the building sits

522
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,616
right next to
an old industrial lot.

523
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,900
It turns out that lot
has soil levels

524
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,685
of arsenic and chromium
that are off the charts.

525
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,770
What does that mean?

526
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:52,939
What it... it means,
it's a toxic wasteland.

527
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,720
So if Gavin closes the deal
with the, um...

528
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,140
Oh, with the...
with the Alpern group,

529
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,742
I mean, he's screwed.

530
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,227
Like he's $100-million screwed.

531
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,612
Well, then you gotta
tell him, Henry.

532
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah, babe, I have to tell him,

533
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:07,748
and then the leak gets traced
back to me, and I'm done,

534
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:09,233
and we're back in Indiana.

535
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,185
Okay, what are you gonna do?

536
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,803
I-I don't know.

537
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,305
I'm gonna pretend I know
nothing about what I know

538
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,606
for the next two hours,

539
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,658
and then quietly freak out
after they leave.

540
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,145
Maybe inviting them over
wasn't such a good idea.

541
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,133
Hi.

542
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,284
Hi, Gavin.

543
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,402
Hi. Welcome. Come on in.
Please.

544
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:29,520
Come on in.

545
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:30,637
Make yourself at home.

546
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,906
Something smells delicious.
Mwah. Mm.

547
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,040
For you.

548
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,275
Oh, Gavin, thank you so much.

549
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,376
Henry.

550
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,577
Chateau Monique.

551
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,711
Mm-hmm.

552
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:39,363
Our favorite.

553
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,767
What the hell
are you looking at?

554
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:07,907
Oh, knock it off. Damn it!

555
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,325
Ah!

556
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:30,646
Aah!

557
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:32,314
Get off me.

558
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:33,499
Oh.

559
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:26,285
Oh! What the hell
are you doing?

560
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,254
Get outta here.

561
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:31,557
You closed the curtains.

562
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,692
I wanted to see you.

563
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:34,810
How did you get in here?

564
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:35,994
You know how.

565
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,747
Made a key.

566
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:46,171
You've been watching me
from your window.

567
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,173
I know you want me.

568
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,724
You need to leave.

569
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,260
Right now.

570
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,811
Really?

571
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:58,066
Yeah. I want you to leave.

572
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,879
Jane, you are an amazing cook.

573
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:17,536
Mm.

574
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:18,657
Oh, thank you.

575
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:19,942
I know pot roast screams
'50s housewife,

576
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,410
but I've never had a complaint.

577
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:23,885
There's nothing wrong with
being a little old-fashioned.

578
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,103
This is delicious.

579
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:27,856
Mm. You should tell them
who taught you how to cook.

580
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:29,324
Would I know the chef?

581
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,509
Probably not.
Uh, it was my grandmother.

582
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:33,461
Uh, I always helped her cook
Sunday night dinner growing up.

583
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:35,931
Uh, she was convinced
that cooking a proper roast

584
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,649
would help me find
a proper husband, so...

585
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:39,050
You want to talk about
old-fashioned...

586
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,802
Well, it would've worked on me.

587
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:43,021
Speaking of husbands,

588
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,126
what are your plans together?

589
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,395
Well, uh, sure.

590
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:49,247
E-eventually. Right?

591
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:50,682
How long have you two
been together?

592
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:52,150
Mm. What is it... Uh...

593
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:53,268
Like four...

594
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:55,386
uh, almost five years.
Yeah, five years.

595
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:57,188
You know, it's something
we've... we've talked about,

596
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:58,756
but we're...

597
00:29:58,791 --> 00:29:59,991
Not in any rush.

598
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:01,826
Oh, I wouldn't wait too long.

599
00:30:01,877 --> 00:30:05,322
Men like Henry get snatched up

600
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:06,918
pretty quickly in this city.

601
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,758
It's a jungle out there.

602
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:13,663
No, that's not true. Come on.

603
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:15,565
I'm serious. He was jealous.

604
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,867
He did not just keep
forgetting to bring my drink.

605
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,919
Jealous and passive-aggressive?

606
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:20,953
Well...

607
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,188
maybe he was just a bad waiter.

608
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,706
Nah. I saw the way
he was looking at you.

609
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:24,857
Oh, really?

610
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:26,008
Mm-hmm.

611
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,510
Mm. Well...

612
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:29,962
What way was that?

613
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,598
Kind of like I am right now.

614
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:38,554
So what happens now?

615
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,879
Do you want me?

616
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:48,381
Tell me.

617
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,799
I want you.

618
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,767
So Jane discovered

619
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,402
an interesting bit
of history today

620
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:02,071
about the Drake.

621
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:03,222
Is that right?

622
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:06,108
Yeah, apparently,
there was a... murder

623
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:09,445
in the building
back in, uh, 1956.

624
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,829
Did you know about this?

625
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,765
Well, I'm old,
but I'm not that old.

626
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,650
That was long
before my time at the Drake.

627
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,553
Uh, the victim was a man
named Edward Paxton.

628
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:18,837
They never caught his killer.

629
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:20,339
Sounds terrible.

630
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,724
Where did you get this paper?

631
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:23,325
This looks like
an original copy.

632
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,945
Oh, uh, at the... the library.

633
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,347
Oh. Fascinating.

634
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:30,399
I love a murder mystery.

635
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,551
It happened
at the Drake.

636
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:33,919
Where exactly?

637
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:36,155
Uh, apartment 7g.

638
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:38,874
Who's in that apartment, honey?

639
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,943
Our friend Danielle Tyler.

640
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,211
Oh.

641
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:43,829
Mm.

642
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,551
Mm.

643
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,718
Henry.

644
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,920
Hmm?

645
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:03,489
Sometimes, like...

646
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:06,258
With the birds in the walls
and...

647
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:10,296
That door I keep seeing...

648
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,966
I know it sounds crazy, but...

649
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,702
I feel like the building's
trying to tell me something.

650
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:18,170
I don't know what it is yet.

651
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,772
Wait. I hear it.

652
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,742
It's saying good night.

653
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:30,216
Good night.

654
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,905
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

655
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,257
I gotta get home.

656
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,674
Please stay with me tonight.

657
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:48,162
Don't. I thought we were both
gonna be adults here.

658
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,230
What does that mean?

659
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:53,050
It means,
my wife is gonna kill me

660
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,818
if I don't get home tonight.

661
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:56,353
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

662
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:57,471
You knew what the deal was.

663
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:59,573
I never took off
my wedding ring.

664
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:02,326
You didn't have one.

665
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,811
I looked.

666
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:05,412
I did.

667
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:06,930
I know I did.

668
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:08,165
Right.

669
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,666
Look...

670
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:10,751
I gotta go.

671
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:12,002
No.

672
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,320
Frank.

673

679
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:04,437
Eddie?

680
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:11,177
I loved you so much.

681
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:16,933
Aah!

682
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,850
Oh!

683
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:37,954
Gavin.

684
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:39,772
Please help me.

685
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:43,309
I don't... I don't know
what happened.

686
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:46,929
Looks to me like Frank Alpern
got what he deserved.

687
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:48,281
What?

688
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:49,916
He was a cheat.

689
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,584
Tried to screw me over
in a deal

690
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:53,285
that he knew was bad.

691
00:34:53,303 --> 00:34:54,604
Oh.

692
00:34:54,638 --> 00:34:57,874
And what he did to you,
leading you on like that...

693
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:01,194
I don't blame you
for getting upset.

694
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:03,012
On the contrary.

695
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,230
I was counting on it.

696
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:06,416
But I-I didn't kill Frank.

697
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,885
It's the price we pay

698
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,670
for the thing we want the most.

699
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:12,205
I didn't kill him.

700
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,557
Do you remember Edward,

701
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:15,808
your first love?

702
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:19,446
Told you he was in love
with another woman.

703
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,381
He broke your heart.

704
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:24,451
Oh.

705
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:25,818
And Carlos...

706
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:28,154
Who betrayed you the same way?

707
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:32,125
No, oh, it's not...

708
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:35,445
And Michael...

709
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:37,230
Oh, no.

710
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,948
Who used you?

711
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:43,634
And Dominick?

712
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:45,436
No, it...

713
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:50,908
And all the others...

714
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:52,510
No, no. Through the years?

715
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:55,179
No. It's not true.

716
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:57,281
It's not true.

717
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,654
Oh, come.

718
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:23,207
Shh.

719
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:24,575
Shh.

720
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:28,663
I'll take care of the mess.

721
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:32,133
And when you wake up
in the morning,

722
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,085
I promise you,

723
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,671
you'll feel like
a brand-new woman.

724
00:36:58,506 --> 00:37:01,141
Mr. Doran.

725
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,533
Morning, Gavin.

726
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:11,851
Good morning.

727
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:13,269
I thought you would
be interested to know

728
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:14,821
that we closed the deal
with the Alpern group

729
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:16,756
late last night.

730
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,007
Congratulations.

731
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:19,976
Although I can't imagine
anyone wanting to live there

732
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:22,245
given how toxic the lot
next door is.

733
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:25,115
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

734
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:27,934
Look, Gavin, I c...
I couldn't say anything.

735
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:29,519
I wanted to, but, uh...

736
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:30,703
you did the right thing.

737
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:32,105
You're not upset?

738
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:35,341
That you didn't abuse your
position to curry favor with me?

739
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,743
The world is full
of temptations, Henry.

740
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:41,080
People with integrity are rare.

741
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:45,470
Well, I'm still sorry,
for what it's worth.

742
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:46,537
No hard feelings.

743
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:47,822
I flipped the property
this morning

744
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:49,390
to a Chinese investor
before the news broke.

745
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,792
I cleared $20 million.

746
00:37:50,826 --> 00:37:52,727
You had an ace up your sleeve?

747
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:54,662
I always do.

748
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,598
All right. Well, I, uh,
I better get to work.

749
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,317
Enjoy the day.

750
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,703
It's gonna be a hot one.

751
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:07,037
Guess you were right.

752
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:09,055
I knew he wouldn't bite.
He's a stand-up kid.

753
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,707
So he passed your little test.

754
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:12,559
Mm-hmm. He's perfect.

755
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:14,727
He's a boy scout, Gavin.

756
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:16,196
No, no.

757
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,331
He is going to be a hero.

758
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,918
Mm. Bye.

759
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:27,792
Oh, you're gonna end up
putting me in the hospital, Lou.

760
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:30,545
I'm not getting back on
that elevator.

761
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:33,348
Brian, why are
all the curtains drawn?

762
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:35,149
It's like a cave in here.

763
00:38:35,184 --> 00:38:37,085
No, let me help you.

764
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,153
I don't want you
to strain yourself.

765
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:40,405
Is there mail?

766
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,573
Yeah.

767
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,758
Oh. Wow. All this?

768
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:46,794
I was only gone a few days.

769
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:50,231
Bills, bills, more bills.

770
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,518
What's this?

771
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:54,602
Hmm?

772
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,203
Who's it from?

773
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:00,475
It's from, uh, Gavin Doran.

774
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:03,695
An apology. Guess he knows
I'm gonna sue his ass.

775
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:10,276
Honey.

776
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,777
Hmm?

777
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:14,347
Gavin just gave us $300,000.

778
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:16,465
I'm feeling better already.

779
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:22,972
That's great.

780
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,608
His supervisor suggests
we look for him

781
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:27,043
at the bottom
of whiskey bottle.

782
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:28,778
Great. That's helpful.

783
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:30,563
Yeah. I'll find you
another exterminator.

784
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:31,697
Thank you.

785
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:33,282
That's not necessary, Tony.

786
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:35,384
Those birds never bothered
anyone before.

787
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:38,170
Have the wall in
Barlow's apartment closed up.

788
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:39,438
Just leave them alone?

789
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:42,124
They've probably been nesting
there for 50 years.

790
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:44,326
The Drake is their home, too.

791
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:46,812
Oh, well, then, I'll, uh,

792
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:48,330
I'll take it off my list.

793
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:50,933
I-I should probably
get back to work, though.

794
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,067
But thanks, Gavin.

795
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:53,335
Mm.

796
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,322
And, Jane,

797
00:39:57,534 --> 00:40:00,052
you might want to take care of
that mess down in the basement.

798
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:05,324
Oh, okay. I'll...
I'll get on that.

799
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:12,464
Good morning, Jane.

800
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:14,200
Danielle, hey.

801
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:16,235
How was your, uh,
your date last night?

802
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,905
Go figure. He canceled.

803
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:20,473
Oh, I'm sorry.

804
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:21,557
His loss.

805
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:23,576
That's right.
Anyway, I gotta run.

806
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,710
Can we, uh,
can we catch up later?

807
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:25,878
Sure.

808
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:27,914
Great.

809
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:34,288
Tell Henry I say hi.

810
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:39,743
She's sweet.

811
00:40:39,777 --> 00:40:41,044
Mm-hmm.

812
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,929
Lucky to have found
someone like Henry.

813
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:47,200
"Finding love makes it worth
the pain of searching for it."

814
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:50,554
I think I've heard that
before, somewhere.

815
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:51,888
Mm-hmm.

816
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:55,342
I hope it's true.

817
