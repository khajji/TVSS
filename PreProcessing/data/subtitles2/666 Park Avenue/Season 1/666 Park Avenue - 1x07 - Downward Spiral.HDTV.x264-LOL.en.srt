1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,850
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,489
I was right about Henry. He's a hero.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,120
H-how did I get this tattoo on my chest?

4
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:10,719
Well, they say that a debt
is a mark against the soul.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,129
There is a darkness coming from this place.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,180
If I stay here--if I stay
here, I'm gonna go crazy

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,739
or I'm gonna get hurt

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,059
I believe a new patient named
Kandinsky has just arrived.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,039
Time to start repaying that debt.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,349
I want the Drake.

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,129
I'm going to give you a chance
to walk away from this fight,

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,040
and I strongly suggest you accept my offer.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,360
Hold the elevator, please!

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,020
Thank you.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,590
Melanie.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,139
You're Lottie's daughter, right?

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,680
That's me.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,950
Tenth floor, isn't it?

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,080
Your mother is one of
my favorite residents.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,020
She must be very excited
to become a grandmother.

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,090
And how's your little girl doing?

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,409
How'd you know I was having a little girl?

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,250
Mm, lucky guess.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,889
Melanie! What are you doing here?

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,509
I brought you groceries.

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,410
The farmers' market had
some amazing peaches.

27
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,189
I, uh... saw Mr. Doran in the elevator.

28
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,450
Did you speak to him?

29
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:43,930
Of course I did. What do you
expect me to do, ignore him?

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,540
He guessed I was having a little girl.

31
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,449
I told you never to speak to him.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,480
You shouldn't come around
here while you're pregnant.

33
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:50,519
Why not?

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,840
I get worried about you
living in this place alone.

35
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,080
You have to go.

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,789
And don't come back until
after this baby is born.

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,018
- But what if I wanna see you?
- Doesn't matter.

38
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,300
I don't want you around the
bad things in this building.

39
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,499
Okay, w-what bad things?

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,990
Mom, I'm not gonna leave you
here if this place is dangerous.

41
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,529
There's nothing you can do for me.

42
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,419
I-I can't leave the Drake now.

43
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,520
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,480
For the sake of baby Nona,

45
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,040
you have got to leave.

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,760
- Mom.
- No.

47
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,570
Go on.

48
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,429
- M-mama, stop! Y--
- No.

49
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,100
- Get out of here.
- You're acting crazy!

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,860
Hello?

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,880
Is anyone there?

52
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,899
Please. Please, please.

53
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,740
S-some--somebody?!

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,550
P-please help me!

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,260
How's that, grandma?

56
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,860
Better?

57
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:41,444

58
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,010
I just spoke to Gavin,

59
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:46,330
and they want us to ride over with them.

60
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,620
Okay. Great.

61
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,259
Babe, you're not excited?

62
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,080
Come on, your boyfriend's getting

63
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,949
a commendation from the
mayor for being a badass.

64
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,240
And we're going over there in a limo.

65
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,390
Yeah.

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,520
Yeah, it's, uh...

67
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,400
It's great.

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,690
You know what the weird thing is?

69
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,080
I mean, I remember the gun,

70
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,020
I remember swinging the
chair at Kandinsky...

71
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,490
Jane?

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,790
What's going on?

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,730
Everything's going so well for you, Henry.

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,930
I-I'm proud of you, but...

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,410
I can't stay here,

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,530
not after what happened on Halloween night.

77
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,188
I wanna go home.

78
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,628
Look, I know something happened to you.

79
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,990
- I'm not doubting that for a second.
- Something.

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,160
Henry, I don't feel safe here.

81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,410
Do you understand?

82
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm scared.

83
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,250
Jane, you were the one that told me

84
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,480
I shouldn't run away from my fear.

85
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,270
You convinced me to come
to New York, all right?

86
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:06,180
And now everything is--
is going great for us.

87
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,950
Us, not just me, Jane.

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,520
We should go.

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,540
We don't want to be late.

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,039
Acting with courage and without
regard for his own safety,

91
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,709
Henry single-handedly stopped the gunman

92
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,379
before he could fire his weapon again.

93
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,850
Aristotle said that the
greatest quality of the mind,

94
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,969
next to honor, is courage.

95
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,009
Henry Martin exemplifies
both of these qualities.

96
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,850
He's a new citizen of our great city,

97
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,329
but we embrace him as one of our sons.

98
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,590
And in recognition of his heroism,

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,589
demonstrating exceptional
bravery and citizenship,

100
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,949
I am pleased to present Henry Martin

101
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,789
with the bronze medallion.

102
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,010
Henry, congratulations.

103
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,230
Here, here!

104
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,189
There he is.

105
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,229
Henry!

106
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,330
Hi. My hero.

107
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,979
The whole time, I was imagining
you behind that podium.

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,878
"Mayor Henry Martin"-- has a nice ring.

109
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,280
All right, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

110
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,380
It was a nice honor, that's all.

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,899
Uh, Jane, can I talk to
you about something?

112
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,570
Yeah.

113
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,200
A friend of mine on the symphony board

114
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,650
just bought a brownstone in Gramercy Park.

115
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,350
She's looking for an architect,
so I thought of you.

116
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,070
Oh. Olivia, uh, thank you.

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,420
Um... but listen, I've been
meaning to tell you and Gavin,

118
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,249
I've decided to leave New York.

119
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,489
Why?

120
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,899
I'm just not sure I really belong here,

121
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,690
with... everything that's happened.

122
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,600
You're running away?

123
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,559
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it running way.

124
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,939
I understand. It's just too bad.

125
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,340
Just when opportunity decided to knock...

126
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,110
Lou?

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,420
Louise?

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,639
Oh, my God, Brian. You scared me.

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
Where's Louise?

130
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,079
She's on a photo shoot in Miami.

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,460
She asked me to send her a few things.

132
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,260
Where have you been?

133
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:54,899
I started to think you weren't coming back.

134
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,899
I've been staying with
a friend in Brooklyn,

135
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,459
just until I can figure a few things out.

136
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,529
I just came by to grab some stuff.

137
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm sorry about what
happened between you guys.

138
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,049
God, if any of this was... because of me--

139
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,840
Please stop.

140
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,790
You're entering highly ironic territory.

141
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,260
And look, it--it's been
building for a while.

142
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,050
I can't remember the last time

143
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,930
that Louise and I were
actually happy together.

144
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,860
And for what it's worth,

145
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,490
it's not like you made
her sleep with that guy.

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,110
She did that on her own.

147
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,699
Brian, you read a text message.

148
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,219
You don't know if she cheated.

149
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,799
I saw the expression on Lou's face
when she stepped off that elevator.

150
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,319
I haven't seen that look in years.

151
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,330
Least not for me, anyway.

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,530
Well... I think you're a great guy.

153
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,439
So, Henry, what's going on?

154
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,639
Things have been a little
weird for Jane at the Drake.

155
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,239
She's... seeing things.

156
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,708
I mean, she's convinced this place is--

157
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:09,730
It's an old building.

158
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:12,240
Sometimes it gets under people's skin.

159
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,740
Question is,

160
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,649
you love her that much.

161
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,799
You're willing to walk
away from your dreams?

162
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,350
Gavin, I couldn't imagine
my life without her, but...

163
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,920
I wouldn't be asking your advice
if this were an easy decision.

164
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,499
The best part of who we are
is the women who love us.

165
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,939
We're weak without them.

166
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,128
And if we're smart,

167
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,120
we'll do anything we can
to keep them happy.

168
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,330
That is exactly right.

169
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,279
I remember you told me

170
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,529
you wanted to marry Jane. Is that true?

171
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,129
Yeah. Absolutely.

172
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,140
I know it sounds quaint,
but I believe in marriage.

173
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,840
Are you saying propose?

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,229
Oh, Gavin, I, uh...

175
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,660
I don't think this is the right time.

176
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,489
Then you make it the right time.
You make it the perfect time.

177
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,830
I think you have a bright
future in this town, Henry.

178
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,439
You're a hero now,

179
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,119
but memory fades.

180
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,920
You're not gonna get another shot like this

181
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,990
to fulfill your promise.

182
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,309
If I were you, I would do whatever I could

183
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,930
to keep Jane right here.

184
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,239
So you think if I propose to Jane,

185
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,959
she's gonna stay in New York?

186
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,510
I do.

187
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,270
And if you're really serious
about doing it, Henry,

188
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,230
Olivia is the one to ask.

189
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,250
Ask me what?

190
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,839
Well, if...

191
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,119
I was in the market for, say..

192
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,379
a diamond ring,

193
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,759
Could you point me in the right direction?

194
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,129
Meet me here tomorrow at 3:00.

195
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,659
I'll take you to Judith Ripka.

196
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,940
I've got the guy for you.

197
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:48,460
All right. Thank you, Olivia.

198
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,099
Gavin, I, um, I appreciate the advice.

199
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,228
Always here for you, Henry.

200
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:55,110
All right, have a good night, guys.

201
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,479
Uh, Jane told me that she's
leaving New York today.

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,659
I'm not letting either
one of them walk away.

203
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,869
Well, the timing of this couldn't be worse.

204
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,209
Darling, we're gonna be fine.

205
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,720
And what about Victor Shaw?

206
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,910
The situation is being dealt
with even as we speak.

207
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,509
Gotta make sure you're clean, Doc.

208
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,680
I don't have any weapons on me.

209
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,520
Can I please see my patient now?

210
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,140
Thank you.

211
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,150
What the hell happened to you?!

212
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,310
Grandma?

213
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,600
Are you out here?

214
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,450
Grandma?

215
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,520
How did you get out here?

216
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,790
How are you even standing?

217
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,940
Grandma...

218
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,570
What's happening?

219
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,939
Don't...

220
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,400
Let...

221
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,100
Jane...

222
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,780
Leave.

223
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,739
Walt, could you do me a favor and,

224
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,299
take this letter upstairs
to Mr. Doran, please?

225
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,800
I-I'll watch the desk.

226
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,250
Your resignation letter, huh?

227
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,470
Why would you say that?

228
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,859
Oh, I don't know. I just...
kinda thought it.

229
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,548
Right. Well,

230
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:36,860
Can you just take the letter
upstairs right now, please?

231
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,789
- On my way.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,500
Tony's gonna be happy
you're stepping aside.

233
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,450
Jane?

234
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,559
Nona.

235
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,389
Where are you going?

236
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,560
Nowhere right now.

237
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:55,309
I'm just, uh, watching the desk for Walt.

238
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,960
I mean, are you moving out?

239
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,390
Well, uh...

240
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,439
Actually, I was gonna tell
people later this week.

241
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,220
Yeah. I, uh...

242
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,109
I'm moving back to Indiana.

243
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,230
No, you can't.

244
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,120
My grandma said I can't
let you leave, Jane.

245
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,149
Okay.

246
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,019
Well, I've--I've never
actually met your grandmother,

247
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,359
And even if I had, it's really
not her choice to make.

248
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,259
Don't you get it?

249
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,869
You're a part of this place.

250
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,309
Okay, Nona, stop.

251
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,740
This place scares me.
Do you understand that?

252
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,640
You run away,

253
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,860
I lose the one person at
the drake I can trust.

254
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,380
Nona, it...

255
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,510
Wow. I--Olivia, these are
all beautiful, but...

256
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,540
I get the feeling that I can't
afford a ring box in this place.

257
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,860
What kind of budget are
we dealing with, Henry?

258
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,240
Little over $3,000.

259
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,710
Well, how--how--how much is this one?

260
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,220
$3,000.

261
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,250
Really?

262
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,689
How much is this one?

263
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,100
Around $3,000.

264
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,910
Olivia, what are you doing?

265
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,929
Helping you get engaged.

266
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,780
That's all you need to know.

267
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,790
Um, you know, Olivia,

268
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,709
I proposed to Jane once before.

269
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,239
And she said no?

270
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,969
Well, it was-- it was spontaneous.

271
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,230
We were caught up in the moment,

272
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,170
And she wanted to wait till
we got settled in New York.

273
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,309
There's a right way and
wrong way to do it, Henry.

274
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,129
I know Jane's a small town girl,

275
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,669
but inside, she's sophisticated.

276
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,060
I doubt she'd say no to any one of these.

277
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,420
Dr. Evans, what can I do for you?

278
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,258
What the hell did you get me mixed up in?

279
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,238
As I recall,

280
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,318
you were short of funds, and
I loaned you some money.

281
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,140
What's the problem?

282
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,779
I was supposed to help him escape,

283
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,709
not kill two people.

284
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,110
That was not...

285
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,740
That was not part of the deal.

286
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,509
All right, their blood is on your hands.

287
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,809
You were the one who sewed a
scalpel into your patient.

288
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,339
What did you possibly think that was for?

289
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,559
I paid my debt. I am done.

290
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,079
You're done when I say
you're done, Dr. Evans.

291
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,908
That's the way it works when you owe me.

292
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,860
You of all people should know by now

293
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:30,840
money is never free.

294
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,230
That wound looks pretty nasty.

295
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,380
I'm fine.

296
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,140
Tell me what you need.

297
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,189
Victor Shaw-- B.A. from Harvard,

298
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,400
M.B.A. from Wharton,

299
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,820
made his fortune in shipping.

300
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,060
If he weren't out to destroy me,
I might actually admire him.

301
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,640
You want me to kill this Victor Shaw?

302
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:01,670
At some point, yes.

303
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,359
But he stole something
from me, of great value.

304
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,640
I want it back.

305
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,900
I'll bring him to you alive.

306
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,310
That would be a great help.

307
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,110
Right this way.

308
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,270
The only thing more beautiful
than that necklace is you.

309
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,610
What do you want, Mr. Shaw?

310
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,479
To buy you a gift.

311
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,400
You can wear it to your symphony
event at the Bergen Mansion.

312
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh. Why don't you join us tomorrow night?

313
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,930
It's for a good cause.

314
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,450
Gavin lets you step out of the
gilded cage now and then?

315
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,589
Hasn't the gold started to lose its luster?

316
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,830
I prefer platinum.

317
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,280
You don't strike me as the type of woman

318
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:08,150
to be satisfied with just that.

319
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,410
Ever think about cutting the lifeline?

320
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,570
Being free of him?

321
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,510
I can help you do that.

322
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,530
I bet you think about it.

323
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,200
You're suggesting I betray my husband.

324
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,460
And why would I do that?

325
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:30,380
Because secretly, I think you want to.

326
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,840
What would I have to do for you?

327
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,420
A simple show of allegiance.

328
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,120
Jane?

329
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,160
Oh, my god. You scared me.

330
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,710
Even though it doesn't
feel like we're moving,

331
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,780
we actually are.

332
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,510
That little girl...

333
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,900
who is she?

334
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,310
She's like me--

335
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,359
a child of the Drake.

336
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,660
That's what my grandma calls us.

337
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,299
We're connected to this
building in a special way.

338
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,289
You're special, too, Jane.

339
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,810
No.

340
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,310
I'm not.

341
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,350
Then how was I able to
step inside your dream?

342
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,119
I gotta tell you, Henry.
This marriage thing?

343
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,259
Brother, it is complicated.

344
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,760
Oh. But I thought you
guys were making it work?

345
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,519
Yeah, me too,

346
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,349
but that was before Louise slept
with the doctor from downstairs.

347
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,800
What?

348
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,530
But to be honest, I get it.

349
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,870
You know, she thinks I'm
not the same guy I was

350
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:45,379
when we got married, and--and she's right.

351
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,470
Well, Brian, everybody goes
through rough patches.

352
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,549
Yeah, but how do you think she feels?

353
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,780
She's stuck with a husband
who can't provide for her.

354
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,820
She probably saw this
Dr. Evans guy as a way out.

355
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,590
All I know is,

356
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:01,199
take my advice.

357
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,300
Don't ever get married.

358
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,830
It changes everything.

359
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,570
What?

360
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,620
I-I'm proposing to Jane tonight.

361
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,460
So...

362
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,500
Congratulations.

363
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:23,290
Yeah. Thank you.

364
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,820
Do you wanna keep jogging?

365
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,270
Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,600
Idiot.

367
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
Hey. So...

368
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,690
Last night...

369
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,340
Did you...

370
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,230
I told you, Jane.

371
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,270
You're special.

372
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,570
That's not possible.

373
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,369
Come in. There's someone
I want you to meet.

374
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,130
Grandma? We have a visitor.

375
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,870
It's the lady I told you about-- Jane.

376
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,070
Uh, Jane, I want you to meet
my grandma, Lottie Clark.

377
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,609
Hello, Mrs. Clark.

378
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,060
It's lovely to meet you.

379
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,400
She can't talk anymore. I
mean, she's in there...

380
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,930
Somewhere.

381
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,000
How long has she been like this?

382
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,560
Couple years,

383
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,010
right after my parents died.

384
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,060
And you've been taking care
of yourself this whole time?

385
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,280
Nona, you should've told somebody.

386
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,559
I-I should call social services,
have somebody come in here.

387
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,730
No! No, you can't tell anyone about her.

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,149
They'll put her in a home.
They'll put me in foster care.

389
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,970
Nona, you're a minor

390
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:45,139
taking care of an elderly woman
with a very serious condition.

391
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,580
I--

392
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:47,490
Doctors can't fix her.

393
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,890
I mean, something happened
to her right here,

394
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,620
right inside the Drake.

395
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,410
She was looking for answers, too,

396
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,060
just like you.

397
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,520
Answers to what?

398
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
What happened to my mom and dad,

399
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,760
what happens to a lot of people here.

400
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,340
They die or just...

401
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,100
disappear.

402
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,150
Looking for something?

403
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,200
What are you doing here?

404
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,960
If you were leaving for a while,

405
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,400
I wanted to say one more good-bye.

406
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,180
Take care of yourself.

407
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,550
Um, I-I'm sorry.

408
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,930
I... I don't know what I was thinking.
I just...

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,610
wanted to do that one more time.

410
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,600
Then what took you so long?

411
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,660
I wanna show you something.

412
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,700
Oh, my God.

413
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,890
My grandma found most of this.

414
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,500
I try to add to it when I can.

415
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,490
This is incredible.

416
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,050
You were the person that

417
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:01,010
put that newspaper article
under my door a few weeks ago,

418
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,950
about the guy from the
1950s who was murdered.

419
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,140
I found something else I think
you might be interested in.

420
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,730
Right there. The photo of the little girl.

421
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,060
Take a look.

422
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,220
Look on the back.

423
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,880
Like I said, you're a
child of the Drake, too.

424
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,479
N-n-no. I...

425
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,879
This isn't possible. I--

426
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,489
- Jane, it's you.
- It is me,

427
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,680
but I didn't leave Indiana
till high school.

428
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,160
I-I've never been here in the lobby. I...

429
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,659
How did somebody take this picture?

430
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,760
Maybe you should stay and find out.

431
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,520
I mean, I didn't think I'd
ever been to New York

432
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,190
until I came here with Henry.

433
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,120
This makes no sense.

434
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,610
M-maybe you were too young to remember.

435
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,950
In 1992, I-I was 8 years old.

436
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,629
I think I'd remember coming to New York.

437
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,890
I mean, this is crazy.

438
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,800
What do you think it means?

439
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
That's why you have to stay, Jane.

440
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,810
- Jane, I'm home!
- In here!

441
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,410
- Hi, Nona.
- Hey.

442
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,730
What's going on?

443
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,070
- Just hanging out.
- That's fun.

444
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,390
Uh, just don't forget we have our
thing to get ready for tonight.

445
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,670
Hey, Nona.

446
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,010
- Let's talk later. Okay?
- Definitely.

447
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,960
- Scott!
- Get out of my way.

448
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,580
Dude, I have much bigger problems

449
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,649
than you and your pathetic love life.

450
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,640
Just tell me how long you
were sleeping with my wife.

451
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,520
- I never touched your wife.
- Really?

452
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,108
That's how you're gonna play it?

453
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,358
Listen, you don't deserve this,

454
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,830
but I'm gonna save you a lot of heartache.

455
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:31,559
I never touched your wife.

456
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,709
- I saw the text.
- What text?

457
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,149
Halloween. The party.

458
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,000
You texted her to come
up to your apartment.

459
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:39,279
No. I had lost my phone,

460
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,720
and it--it was gone all night.

461
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,069
Till Alexis found it and
gave it back to me.

462
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,639
- Alexis?
- Yeah, right--right after we hooked up.

463
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,070
Wait. What. You and Alexis?

464
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,129
H-how did I get this tattoo on my chest?

465
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,900
Well, they say that a debt
is a mark against the soul.

466
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,220
You're not ready yet?

467
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,350
Perfection takes time.

468
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,039
Oh. You missed a spot.

469
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,860
Let me.

470
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,010
Any closer to finding the box?

471
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,120
I have someone working on it.

472
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,630
Shaw followed me to the jewelry store.

473
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,260
He's gonna be at the
symphony event tonight.

474
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,250
If I didn't know better, I'd
say he was interested in you.

475
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,830
He asked me to help bring you down.

476
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,730
Oh, of course he did.

477
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,160
Maybe you should take him up on that.

478
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,480
Gavin, he wants me to betray you.

479
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,320
Mm. You know I'd never do that.

480
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,930
I know.

481
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,620
Wow. This place is amazing.

482
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,990
Yes, it is.

483
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,560
Champagne?

484
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,110
Uh, no, thank you.

485
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,040
Are you okay?

486
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,930
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Just, uh...

487
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,970
- Hungry.
- Okay.

488
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,669
Look around, Jane.

489
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,380
You really want to give all this up?

490
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,849
Jane. Henry.

491
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,249
I am so glad you two could make it.

492
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,900
Olivia.

493
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,389
It's a perfect send-off

494
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,350
before you head to greener pastures

495
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,779
or wherever it is you're going to. Ohio?

496
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,220
- Indiana.
- I've never been.

497
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,689
Henry, you look dashing tonight.

498
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,349
Oh, thank you, Olivia.

499
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,300
And thank you for everything
you've done for us.

500
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,320
Uh, will you excuse me?

501
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,440
Listen, Henry,

502
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,970
I was hoping somehow...

503
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,530
You would want to come with me.

504
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,080
But I know you can't. I know you can't.

505
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,770
I love you, Henry.

506
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,150
I love you so much.

507
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,370
I can't leave without you.

508
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,720
Stay here with me, Jane.

509
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,560
I love you.

510
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,070
Let's get out of here.

511
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,360
All right. We'll talk.

512
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,248
He's here.

513
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,230
I'm aware.

514
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,530
We don't want to be rude to our guests.

515
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,490
Of course, darling.

516
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,570
Why don't you fix your lipstick?

517
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,750
Yes.

518
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,039
Hello, Victor. Glad you made it.

519
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,809
Happy to support any cause

520
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,050
or woman in need of my assistance.

521
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,370
A toast then.

522
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,100
To leaving the gilded cage.

523
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,420
I did what you made you do, Gavin.

524
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,770
Now I want out of the deal.

525
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,590
Perhaps you should give this
to your husband instead.

526
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,240
He doesn't drink champagne.

527
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,300
Convince him.

528
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,910
Convince me.

529
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,300
Does that convince you?

530
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,339
Dr. Evans, thank God you're here.

531
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,940
That man needs your help.

532
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,720
Somebody help! He's having a seizure.

533
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,718
You weren't made to take lives, doctor.

534
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,120
You were made to save them.

535
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,090
Time is running out.

536
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,450
I'm a doctor.

537
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,470
2 milligrams of lorazepam.

538
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,830
Hang in there.

539
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,970
Are we close?

540
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,090
What are you doing?

541
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,439
We are going back to The Drake.

542
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,940
You need to keep him alive.

543
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,750
Do it now!

544
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,220
Whoa. Hold it. Hold it.

545
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,990
What the hell are you doing?

546
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,990
Aren't you happy to see me?

547
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,129
You made me think my wife
was having an affair

548
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,490
and then you tricked me
into sleeping with you.

549
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,050
No.

550
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,890
You wanted me,

551
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,380
from the first time you
looked through your window

552
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:17,050
and watched me undress.

553
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,650
I gave you your fantasy.

554
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,880
You are gonna stay away from me and Louise.

555
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,769
I am gonna try to make this thing right,

556
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,610
but if you get in my way, so help me--

557
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:31,840
Let go of me.

558
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,120
This is my floor.

559
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,950
I live in The Drake now.

560
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,510
You were ready to walk away from all this?

561
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,860
I do love this building. I just...

562
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,710
I wish it didn't scare the
hell out of me sometimes.

563
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,679
Jane.

564
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,990
Nona, hi.

565
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,140
Can I talk to you? Please.

566
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,830
- Of course. Give just me one second, okay?
- Yeah.

567
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,359
Nona, what's going on?

568
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,850
My grandma's missing.

569
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,939
She's missing? I...

570
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,620
I thought you said she couldn't move.

571
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:16,400
I don't know. I need your help.

572
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,850
We'll find her. I promise. Let's go.

573
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,830
So I have to go and help Nona with...

574
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,809
something, but, uh, I'm
gonna see you upstairs

575
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,050
- in a few minutes, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. Just...

576
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,270
Hurry back.

577
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,150
Olivia.

578
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,950
Grandma!

579
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,750
Are you okay?

580
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,700
Jane.

581
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,010
Lottie?

582
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,720
Lottie, it's Jane. We're
gonna take you upstairs

583
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:23,450
and put you back to bed, okay?

584
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,520
- Grandma!
- Lottie, no!

585
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,370
Are you trying to tell me something?

586
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,310
She's trying to look through it.

587
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,310
The eye.

588
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,220
What eye?

589
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,360
On the mosaic.

590
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,450
I remember the first time I saw it.

591
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,460
The pieces of the mosaic are all original.

592
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,220
Except for the eye.

593
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,720
Careful!

594
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,330
Oh, my God.

595
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,280
Jane.

596
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,410
What are you doing?

597
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,040
I'm going down.

598
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,200
Let me come with you.

599
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:26,240
No. You stay there with Lottie.

600
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,950
It's okay. I...

601
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,570
I think this is something
I'm supposed to do.

602
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,900
It's closing, Jane!

603
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,460
- Hurry!
- Nona!

604
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:11,923
