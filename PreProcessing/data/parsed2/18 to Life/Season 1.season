Ah, love. 
It starts with a simple kiss. 
A kiss that ignites a fire so powerful, it threatens to engulf the natural world within its white Do you mind? 
Sorry. 
I'm a romantic. 
OK. 
Back to truth or dare. 
We're still playing that? 
I thought we were making out. 
So you concede? 
No way! 
Hmm. 
What is that? 
Road kill? 
Sorry, the answer we're looking for is what is Jessie about to lick? 
You're disgusting! 
And you're stalling, which would make me by definition the winner and you Aaaahhh. 
That was unexpectedly hot. 
And... 
gritty. 
Yech. 
You're up, Tom. 
Truth or dare. 
Uh, dare. 
Interesting strategy. 
Foolish, but interesting. 
Let's see. 
Dressing like a girl is always good. 
But so is public nakedness. 
Uh, you made me do that last week; longest bus ride of my life. 
Right. 
Too easy. 
No. 
I need something bigger. 
Something that will show me what Tom Bellow is really made of. 
I know. 
I dare you to propose. 
Propose... 
what? 
Propose, propose. 
Score. 
Excuse me? 
The bottle behind you, it's returnable. 
You know, I'm kidding, right? 
You and me married? 
As if! 
We'd have to come up with names for each other, like Pumpkin or Sugar Plum and you'd get a briefcase and you'd go to work and I'd be all "Have a great day at work, Pumpkin and..." 
Jessie Michelle Hill? 
Twelve years as your neighbour and suddenly I can't stop thinking about you. 
This is for real. 
Will you marry me? 
Almost had me, ha ha. 
No joke, Jess. 
  Did you hear us? 
We're engaged. 
Well, it's out of the question. 
We're not asking; we're eighteen. 
Which makes us adults. 
Adults don't need their parents to drive them to the movies! 
Or prepare a hot meal for them every single night. 
Trying to kill your mother here? 
Hm? 
Jessie's a Gentile! 
We haven't been to temple in years. 
You're talking to Rabbi Schicter. 
Schecter! 
Schecter! 
And how exactly do you expect to support yourself there, Johnny Grown-up? 
I still have savings from my Bar Mitzvah. 
And we all know Tom's a real entrepreneur. 
Get your P, B and J shooters; it's peanut butter and jelly in a glass! 
I still say we should've gone with the lemonade. 
Look, Jessie. 
We expect this sort of thing from Tom. 
But you are the responsible one. 
Why are you doing this to us? 
Because I love him? 
You just ended your declaration of love for my son with a question mark. 
This is completely hypocritical. 
You guys got married at twenty-four, well eighteen? 
It's the new twenty-four. 
You know what else it is? 
Eighteen! 
Hey everyone, since Tom's getting married, can I have his room? 
I'll take that as a yes. 
Well, let's see. 
When I was 24, I was holding down three jobs, finishing my law degree and supporting my widowed mother. 
Tom, I believe on the other hand, just made it to level two of Ninja Surfers, huh? 
Level three. 
What is it? 
Level three. 
Level three! 
I rest my case. 
You know what, Jessie? 
You go next door and talk to your parents, hm? 
Yeah. Maybe they'll knock 
some sense into you. 
Aw, puppy love! 
That's so adorable. 
Nothing like first love, huh? 
Yeah. 
OK, three down: writer of A Modest Proposal. 
Five letters. 
Um, did you hear me? 
We're engaged. 
Wilde. 
Actually, it's not that wild. 
I love her. 
No, no, no. There's a T 
As in Oscar, there. five letters. 
Guys! 
Jessie, what your mother and I think is irrelevant. 
Last time we checked, you're eighteen. 
That's legally an adult. 
But don't you have any regrets, concerns, nuggets of parental wisdom? 
Never go to sleep hungry. 
Who was that? 
Our refugee. 
Oh. 
Sorry, what? 
From Iraq? 
Mom! 
Dad! 
OK, sweetie. 
Um, are you sure that you're in love? 
Is this something that you really want? 
Does he satisfy you in bed? 
Mom! 
Well, honey, because if there are any issues, you're more than welcome to borrow our Kama Sutra. 
It really works. 
Maybe we should go outside and come back in again? 
Jessie, you know how your mother and I feel about weddings. 
They're an exercise in greed with absolutely no real bearing on reality. 
That doesn't mean we won't respect your decision. 
Thank you, Mr. 
and Mrs. Hill. 
I uh, I promise to make your daughter happy. 
Swift. 
Thanks! 
As in Jonathan. 
Five letters. 
What just happened? 
Breathe, Phil. 
Just breathe. 
You like tigers You like lions Do you think that we can make it last? 
You like the bathtub And you take hot showers Do you think that we can make it last? 
Yes I do; yes I do Yes I think that we can make it last What's with my parents? 
Where's the worry? 
The angst? The guilt? 
At my house taking a Valium. 
At least your parents care enough to ask questions. 
"What are you gonna do when college starts?" 
"How will you get money? 
"Where are you gonna live? 
Where are we gonna live? 
Right now, that's the least of our worries, OK? 
My dad has dialled the Jewish up to eleven. 
He's wearing a yarmulke. 
Your dad's about as Jewish as Conan O'Brien. 
Yeah! 
He converted. 
Shouldn't that work in our favour? 
No. He says we're 
practically siblings. 
The sibling thing kind of went out the window when we did it behind the garage. 
But... 
we are best friends. 
I know all your secrets, how you're afraid of moths and lost the Big V to that guy at judo. 
You light candles when you're sad. 
Well, there's plenty of secrets left to uncover. Trust me. 
Really? I'm pretty much 
down to my last one. 
You have a secret? 
No. 
Maybe. 
Are you sure you want to marry the guy who made you eat mud? 
Actually, no. 
But the guy who bought me gummy bears after judo boy dumped me and then changed everything with one single unreal kiss. 
Him I'd consider. 
Well, the worst is over. 
At least our friends will be happy for us. 
No! 
No, no, no, no! 
We're engaged, Carter, not gunned down by enemy fire. 
People marry at eighteen all over the world. 
Right, Marisa? 
You're right, Cupcake and some day many of those villages will have running water. 
You don't know what you're in for. 
Have you ever bought a chick tampons? 
Does he even know about... 
Uh, Tom, buddy. 
Don't tell the girls this but you need to have sex with a lot of other women. 
OK, you guys do realize that we're all sitting here together, right? 
There's no split screen? 
It's not Grease. 
We're just trying to help. 
OK, this engagement is a destroyer of awesome future memories, most of which involve nudity. 
Oh my God, that's it. 
Our cupcake is knocked up! 
Whoa. 
No one's cupcake is knocked up. 
We're in love. 
I'm in love with my new patent leather handbag, but I'm not gonna marry it. 
What about the summer? 
Our road trip to go see the White Stripes? 
I can't now, buddy. 
I want to make this work, you know? 
I love her. 
Yeah, that's right! 
I love her. 
Yeah, I love the way this girl hums when she studies and the little dimples she gets when she smiles. 
Yes, I, Tom Bellow, declare that I will proudly buy this lady tampons! 
Nothing? 
Well, I wish this was a split screen. 
OK, you got to me, Honeybear. 
Thank you. 
Now if only that tampon speech would work on Tom's dad. 
Your dad's OK with it? 
Actually, yeah. 
Oldest trick in the book, sweetie. 
Sic one dad on the other. 
You're good. 
It's what I do. 
  I thought you were your mother. 
Scooch over. 
Uh huh. 
Any jerky left? 
Mm hm. 
Shh! 
Dad! 
If Mom catches us eating dead animal, she'll skin us alive. 
Last one. 
Tom's parents are crazy. 
His dad especially; he's doing everything he can to pry us apart. 
Is it working? 
Well, if he's trying to make us want this more than ever, yes. 
You want me to speak to Ben. 
I'll owe you two teriyakis and a honey garlic. 
No way; this is Ben. 
You'll have to throw in some blood sausage. 
You're onto blood sausage? 
Oooh, it's a slippery slope. 
  You know, they grow twice as fast when you cut them back. 
I believe that is an urban myth. 
Works with the hedges down below. 
Hey! 
Here's something. 
What the hell do you want, Phil? 
I want what you want or don't want, if you catch my drift. 
A man whose idea of curfew is before sunrise suddenly grows some parental backbone. 
What gives? 
Listen very carefully, Ben. 
If we're gonna end this engagement, we need to talk. 
If marrying the random girl next door was our plan for Tom, we probably would've moved to a better neighbourhood. 
And if indentured servitude was part of our plan for Jessie, we'd have moved back into the eighteen hundreds. 
So there! We're in agreement for the 
first time since the garbage strike. 
Oh, I supported the strike. 
Well, you're an idiot. 
Boys, please! 
Tara. If you and Phil 
are against this, then why didn't you do something about it? 
In a situation like this, Judith, you can do one of two things: you can either sit back and play it cool or you can throw gas onto the flames. 
Oh, stay tuned for another thinly-veiled lecture on global warming. 
Dude! 
Relax. 
If we just cut the kids some slack, this whole thing's gonna blow over. 
We're not going to just stand by and watch our only son be ripped from our arms! 
We have big plans for Tom. 
Hey, we're down with that. 
At his age, he should be traipsing the globe with nothing more than a backpack and a beer bong. 
I was talking about college. 
I'm gonna punch him. 
Look, we're all on the same side here. 
We hate marriage, too. 
Who hates marriage? 
We don't hate marriage. 
You're married! 
No, we're not married. 
OK, we're done here, Judith. 
Come on. 
Ben, sit! 
Phil! 
Can it! 
All right. 
The Hills don't believe in marriage and we don't believe in this marriage, then at least we're on common ground. 
Exactly. 
And I say that we let them marry the hell out of each other. 
We give them everything they want and more. 
I like it. 
They're expecting us to fold. 
Instead, we double down. 
Yeah. We don't believe 
in gambling either. 
OK, seriously; I'm gonna punch him. 
Wakey wakey! 
Natural Bride. 
Something Borrowed. 
Eco-Spouse? 
I thought you hated weddings. 
Hate is such an ugly word, Jessie. 
Not inaccurate, but ugly. 
Am I being punked? 
The truth is, honey, I've been guilty of the worst sin of all. 
Bacon? 
Envy. 
Oh, sweetie. 
I just want you to have what I've never had. 
A white hemp dress. 
A bouquet of wild flowers. 
A handsome man that you're tied to by a legal and binding contract till the day you take your last sour breath of air. 
Who wants a wedding? 
  I see you brought in reinforcements. 
What do you mean, sweetie? 
I know how this works, OK? 
You bring in the big sister from downtown; get her to talk some sense into me. 
I know exactly what you're gonna say, Monica. 
I think it's wonderful. 
Oh. 
Well, I know what you're gonna say next. 
And go. 
So when are you gonna pull the trigger, Tom-bit? 
Uhhh... 
Next spring? 
Why wait till next year, Tom? 
Your mother and I got married in the fall, didn't we? 
Lovely time of year. 
Oh yeah. 
Is this 67 Henderson Avenue? 
  Something's going on. 
You think? 
My sister made me try on my dad's tux and said I looked "juicy". 
My dad is on his fourth draft of the father of the bride speech. 
I'm warning you now, the jokes are not good. 
Everyone does a complete one-eighty overnight? 
It's almost as if... 
They talked? 
They talked and now they're toying with us. 
Are we being paranoid? 
Your sister called you "juicy". 
Right. 
OK. 
Let's not panic. 
No, we're gonna handle this like mature adults. 
Let go of me! 
Ow! 
Let go! 
I don't know anything! 
Liar! Your face is red 
and you're stuttering! 
That's because you're choking me. 
Oh no, this is choking. 
Agh! 
OK! 
They're calling your bluff. 
So they're opening up their wallets. 
How wide? 
I've already said too much. 
OK. OK, we are gonna 
play this cool. 
Don't let on we know. 
You know what this means, don't you? 
It's really gonna happen. 
You and me. 
Hitched. 
Yeah, that's great. 
Baby's first lie; I'm so proud. 
What was I supposed to say, Carter? 
That I was suddenly hit with the possibility of it actually happening and I choked? 
I thought that's what you wanted. 
It is. It is, it's just it's... 
It's all happening so fast. 
See that's what happens when a proposal is based on a game of truth or dare. 
I just want this wedding to slow down. 
But I can't tell her that, because then I lose face. 
Well? 
You've come to the right guy. 
See, you put your cards on the table with that engagement. 
But the parents, they raised. 
Clever. 
But they don't know that you know that they know. 
So they won't be prepared for your next move. 
And that is? 
You go all in. 
Hey, Tom. 
Just going over the guest list here. 
Did I mention Auntie Goldie's coming? 
I know how much you love her wet kisses. 
You bet! 
But I hope we're inviting all the cousins, too. 
Oh, second, third and twice-removed. 
Now, you know, we can't invite anyone until we set a date. 
So you were saying spring? 
Well, I was thinking about what you guys were saying earlier and uh, maybe the fall is better. 
October, perhaps. 
Huh. 
A little chilly, don't you think? 
Yeah. 
How about September? 
The colours are breath-taking. 
Well, if we're talking September, how about...August. 
A summer wedding is good luck. 
Next Sunday it is! 
We'll have it in our back yard! 
Too bad. There's not 
going to be enough room for all the Gentiles Jessie's inviting. 
Well, here's a thought. 
Since the Hills and us are in this together... 
let's tear down that fence. 
I'll get the toolbox. 
You don't even care about what I think. 
It's what you think that always matters. 
When it comes to loving me, you have it your way. 
I am persuaded, that makes me madder. 
But when night comes around I get your kisses so sweet. 
Your golden hair is longer than mine. 
I have never met a creature from your planet. 
Oh, baby, you're a crazy guy. 
So what if it's a dare; I know it's real, but I can't do it because I have a secret I can't tell and if I don't, I'm living a lie and I cannot be living a lie because that's just not who I am and what if it's all just a terrible, terrible mistake? 
So? 
What do you think? 
Are we too young to marry? 
My bride was fourteen. 
We met at the wedding. 
But when night comes around I get your kisses so sweet. 
Your golden hair is longer than mine. 
I have never met a creature from your planet. 
I have never met a creature from your planet. 
I have never met a creature from your planet. 
Oh, baby, you're a crazy guy. 
Jessie, wait. 
The wedding's Sunday, Tom. 
You could've been quicker on the bat signal. 
Jessie. I do have a secret and I'd 
just rather you know now than later. 
I'm so glad you said that. 
There's something I have to tell you, too. 
Yeah, and whatever we say, it doesn't matter, right? 
I mean, I know you peed your pants in Mrs. 
Gall's class. 
Thanks for the reminder. 
Yeah, but I'm still crazy about you. 
Nothing you can say can change that. 
So who goes first? 
Both at the same time. 
OK. 
One, two... 
I fart in my sleep. 
I slept with Carter. 
What? 
I mean, not just now. 
A while ago. 
Have you tried eating less dairy? 
So, Carter is Judo Boy. 
It happened two years ago. 
I'm totally over it. 
Kinda weird without the fence, huh. 
Tom, say something. 
Maybe a fence is just a fence and a dare... 
is just a dare. 
So what do you want to do? 
I think the answer's pretty clear. 
Elvis sings: ♪ There's a 24-hour chapel  That doesn't have any seats   I saw you walk down the aisle  Hey everyone? 
We have an announcement. 
I know a lot of you worked really hard on this so this is tough to say. 
The wedding's off. 
Jessie and I had a real trial by fire yesterday and... 
we learned something. 
Fire's hot. 
So that's why we went to City Hall this morning. 
Say hello to my wife. 
Tom: and this is our kitchen.  
well, kitchen... Area. 
Very exciting. 
And yet I yawn for some reason. 
Do you have any cappuccino? 
We don't have a cappuccino machine. 
Espresso? 
Instant coffee? 
i'm assuming you have a kettle. 
Of course we have a kettle. 
Tom, your mom wants her kettle back. 
But I was just gonna make monica a coffee. 
Monica, come down to the real kitchen; i'll make you something decent. 
Ok, is it just me, or does your mom still think you and I are kind of a joke? 
No, no. That's just 
how mom talks. 
Doesn't mean anything, right, monica? 
Boring. I think the question is: 
why don't you have your own stuff? 
Oh well. You know the saying. 
"the best things in life aren't things. " 
yeah, that's not true. 
The problem is you haven't had a bridal shower. 
Oh no, I don't believe in... 
Still boring. Look, 
i'll tell you what. 
We're gonna organize a bridal shower and invite all of mom's rich friends. 
This place will look like the back of a mob truck. 
I don't know. 
Mom does like to plan a party. 
Could be a good chance for you guys to bond. 
You think? 
So let me get this straight: the back of a a mob truck thing doesn't really do it for you, but the bonding does. 
God, you two are so weird. 
Thanks for this, monica. 
Your happiness is thanks enough. 
And, I get first pick of the gifts. Ciao! 
I'm still worried your mom doesn't take us seriously. 
You are being crazy. 
Look, I will you a killer breakfast and we'll forget all about it. 
Just gotta borrow the frying pan. 
boy: can't we find a way that we could be together?  
girl:  is there any way that we could be together?  
both:  and oh by the way, baby, do you love me?  
 yes, I do! Yes, I do! 
yes, I do!  
 wait. Jessie's 
having a bridal shower? 
that's awesome. 
Yeah, I don't think we're invited. 
No, idiot, see? 
If jessie has a shower, that means you get a bachelor party. 
It's called status quo. 
Do you mean quid pro quo? 
Exactly. Tit for tit. 
It's tat. 
What'd I say? 
tit. 
You said tit. 
Maybe you're right. 
A bachelor party could be a good excuse to get away from the family. 
What's this? Did I hear 
something about a bachelor party? 
Uh, well uh... 
Party is kind of overstating it. 
Tom and I were just planning on having a nice dinner together. 
Oh, that sounds nice, girls, but you leave it to me. 
I've been known to plan a bachelor party or two in my day. 
Oh. Good. 
Cause that would mean you'd... You'd come? 
Monica: so for food, we'll need some hors d'oeuvres and sandwich trays. 
No problem. I'll 
call frangelico's. 
No. No frangelico's; their 
products aren't fair trade. 
Well first off, you don't trade. 
You give them money. 
Lots, in fact. 
I got it, princess. 
Frangelico's will be fine, mom. 
Judith, maybe you and I can work on the menu together. 
Oh. That's ok, I 
have it covered. 
Monica: i'll take care of drinks and decorations.  
and I suppose we'll have to plan some shower games. 
Like what, pin-the-veil-on-the-bride? 
You know that's a real thing, right? 
Wow. I am never 
getting married. 
Maybe you and I could come up with some games together. 
It's ok, I have a book around here somewhere. 
I'll take care of it.  
ben: i love bachelor parties! 
hey, why not have it right here at the house? 
That way I get to meet all your chums and kick their butts at ping pong. 
oh darn. 
We're planning on having it the same night as jessie's shower so... 
Phil: you guys talking bachelor party? 
evidently. 
If you're looking for a venue, you could have it here. 
Yeah, I don't think my dad... 
Done. 
Really? 
Now listen; these boys are young, so I don't want any blue movies but I thought we could get those little swizzle sticks shaped like naked ladies. 
I love those! 
Now they get along. 
Monica: so invites? 
here we go. 
They're made from composted material and coloured with vegetable dye. 
Is that... Barley? 
Buckwheat. 
I took the liberty of drawing up a guest list. 
Are these arranged in order of net worth? 
Alphabetical tells us nothing. 
I have a list of my friends too, judith. 
Should we combine them? 
No, that's fine. 
Why don't you send your invitations and I'll send mine. 
There's no point in over-complicating things. 
We're, uh... 
We're really starting to bond. 
Yeah, I'm jealous. 
The only reason I agreed to a shower was to bond with your mom, and now she won't let me. 
Whatever do you mean? 
Well, I keep suggesting fun things we can work on together, you know, as a team... 
Ok. Stop right there. 
What? 
My mom doesn't exactly do the "team" thing. 
You want to connect with her, there's gotta be a little give and... Give. 
Stay away from words like "together" and "team". 
And "fun. " 
what does that leave? 
Tagging along. 
So if I want your mom to like me, i'm supposed to just follow her around and agree to whatever she wants? 
No, I... 
Yeah, actually, that's it exactly! 
I want to write that down. 
How did you say it, again? 
It was really concise. 
tom! 
Look on the bright side. 
My dad could be planning your shower. 
Your father might throw a good bachelor party. 
You don't know. 
Yeah, I do. 
My dad's not good at parties. 
If either party disagrees with my decision, they can file what's called an appeal. 
Now an appeal... Yes? 
Can you cast spells with your hammer? 
I'm not a wizard, kid. 
I'm a judge. 
And this is a gavel. Ok? 
My friends come to this party and I can kiss my rep goodbye. 
Really? 
"rep?" 
no good? 
Yeah, nobody talks like that anymore. 
I'll tell you one thing. 
Our friends come to this party, you can kiss your rep goodbye. 
So what do I do now? 
Dead simple. 
We party with your two dads at the hill's place... 
I wish you wouldn't call them my two dads. 
...but we tell the boys to 
meet us at the frat house, where the real party kicks in after your father nods off watching fox news. 
The frat house? 
Yeah, the frat house! 
I mean we got tunes, beers, guys acting like idiots... 
Cool, so like any other night at the frat house except there won't be girls. 
Jeez, when you say it like that it sounds lame. 
Oh, wait, no, there's gonna be a stripper. 
Ha ha. I forgot to 
mention the stripper. 
I would've led with the stripper. 
Yeah, good note. 
� I don't think the shower guests are going to want to play a hannah montana board game, sweetie. 
There's a drinking version. 
Anything I can do to help with party prep, judith? 
I don't think so. 
Invitations? 
Taken care of. 
Picking them up right now. Decorations? 
Music? 
I've got plenty of cds. 
wow. 
These are great. 
Michael buble. 
The lighter side of... 
Michael buble. 
You're really good at this. 
Thank you, jessie. 
Um, could I come with you to pick up the decorations? 
I've already chosen the colour scheme, you know. 
Oh no, I know, I know. 
I just... I thought it might be 
fun to maybe, carry a box? 
Sure. Why not? 
ok. 
� That was fun. 
I'm glad we got to spend time together. 
You know what? 
I am too. 
You sound surprised. 
Well, I usually do this sort of thing on my own. 
Oh, that's silly, judith. 
You're not a control freak. 
Who said I was? 
Nobody. 
Hey, here's something! 
Did you know I've always loved those jeans on you? 
Yeah. You have such 
great taste in... 
High-waisted pants. 
Really? 
Yeah. Maybe someday you can 
show me where you buy them. 
Well, the stores are open for another hour. 
oh. 
Taxi! 
� Oh, let me help you there. 
Oh, thanks. 
Tonight's really gonna be fun. 
Way better than tom's bachelor thing. 
Oh, I don't know. Ben 
throws a pretty good party. 
And then they burned my village down. 
ok. Well. 
Maybe wedding night stories weren't such a great idea. 
What say we kick this party into high gear with a little chateau hill? 
yes! All right! 
no, no phil. I can't allow 
that. These boys are underage. 
I'll see you later. 
Where are you going? 
Anywhere but here. 
� � ava: these are judith's friends? 
they're a little more candle-and-sandal than I expected. 
These are my friends. 
Oh. They're nice. 
We need a cork screw, and b where the hell are mom's friends? 
It's early. The party 
just started. 
I didn't suggest this so I could get a bunch of hand-knitted tea cozies. 
I want my weight in cold hard appliances. 
You said you just wanted one gift. 
I re-negotiated the terms of our agreement. 
You weren't there. 
But... 
Cork screw. 
� jessie? 
You never mailed the invitations to your friends? 
Wait. It's not as bad 
as you think. 
It's not that i don't like you; it's just that, I haven't told any of my friends that tom got married... To you. 
How is that not as bad as I think? 
Ok, you're right. It is 
as bad as you think. 
You know what? 
This party was a terrible idea. 
� I've been to worse. 
Nora: this is fun.  
how come you never had a shower for your wedding, tara? 
Because phil and I never actually got married, remember? 
That's great. 
Jerry and I have an open relationship, too. 
We don't have an open relationship. 
Yeah, no, we don't either. 
Hey jess. You ok? 
Great. Just great. 
Come on, I know that you're upset. Spill. 
Tom's mother didn't invite any of her friends because she's embarrassed tom married me and she's never going to accept me; she's a miserable shrew and those high-waisted jeans chafed my ribcage. 
Man, when somebody says spill, you spill. 
Tara: everyone? 
I would like to propose a toast to a very special lady. 
I think you all know who I'm talking about.  
our hostess, judith bellow, party planner extraordinaire, and someone who obviously loves jessie very much. 
Everyone. 
To judith! 
All: to judith! 
to judith. 
Yahtzee! 
Hoo hoo. 
Man oh man, this place is dead. 
You sure you gave your friends the right address? 
More so with each passing second. 
Boy, I could use a soda pop. 
How's the real party going? 
Check it out. 
I did not know a dog could funnel beer. 
I can't believe we're missing this party. 
I thought your dad would be asleep by now.  
it's eight-thirty. How 
old did you think he was? 
I dunno. Seventy? 
What are you guys looking at? 
Uh, an application that tracks climate change. 
Apparently it's still happening. 
Let's see. 
Now that is a par-tay. 
What's this? 
Oh, this is going on right now, is it? 
Uh, yeah. I guess the 
guys at the frat house are having a thing tonight, too. 
So if you boys would rather go there, it's all right with us. 
Seriously? 
Sure, why not? 
All right! 
Whose car are we taking? 
we're about to start the games. Are you coming? 
I guess I didn't get my invitation. 
I deserve that. 
Why don't you just admit that you still don't take this marriage seriously? 
All right! 
I don't take it seriously. 
You want to know what really went through my head? 
 Yeah. 
I thought that maybe if I don't tell my friends that my 18-year-old son got married, then maybe I won't have to tell them when he gets divorced. 
I can't believe you just said that. 
Well? Don't ask the question if 
you don't want to hear the answer. 
We're not going to get divorced, judith! 
We love each other. 
You don't know what love is. 
You met when you were children. 
So what? 
When I met ben, I was an adult. 
I remember every detail: his crisp blue blazer, the sweat on his upper lip as he hurled insults at the "no nukes" protesters. 
That's when I knew he was the one for me.  
I just want my son to have what I have. 
Instead he marries the girl next door. 
That's not love, it's convenience. 
Well, thank you for clearing that up. 
I've gotta go lie down. 
� Um, we're out of salmon thingies? 
� � the philster! 
How do they know you? 
I was the condom rep on campus for a couple of weeks. 
How do you think they learned to play fris-beer? 
Yo! You are nuts. 
This might not be so bad. 
Narc! 
Ok everyone, we're going to play the newlywed game. 
So we quizzed tom on a bunch of questions and now we're gonna see how well jessie knows my idiot brother. 
I mean, her loving husband... Who's an idiot. 
And if she gets the answer wrong, she has to take a drink? 
No. So the first question comes 
from tara, mother of the bride. 
All right. 
For ten points: what did tom say his favourite fast food restaurant was? 
Does it matter? 
No one thinks this marriage is going to last anyway. 
I'm sorry, the answer we were looking for was arby's! 
Arby's. 
� Hey, bellow, is that your dad? 
Yeah, it is. 
Thanks, buddy. 
He's old. 
And he's killing his liver. 
Woman: all right, everybody, knock it off! 
so even though you boys have an exam on monday, you're all in here partying like a bunch of animals. 
Well apparently, I'm going to have to teach you all a lesson. 
� � � carter! I can't get a lap 
dance in front of my dad! 
Carter: you are now.  
� oh my god, ben bellow? 
amber? How are you, hon? 
Good to see you! I'm 
doing great! How are you? 
It's been such a long time. 
We have to catch up! 
Absolutely. Listen, go easy 
on him, will you, sweetheart? 
It's my son. 
That's so cute! 
Guy: all right, here we go.  
� carter: how do you know her? 
she's been in and out of my courtroom a few times and I decided to be lenient. 
You know, get her some counselling.  
apparently, it really helped turn her life around.  
but she's a stripper. 
Yeah. 
But she used to be an investment banker. 
"what would your husband like to have more than anything else in the world?" 
a second shot at happiness with someone he hasn't met? 
Hmm, is everything ok, jess? 
Yeah, sweetie. I mean I don't want to 
get all motherly on you or anything, but you really suck at this game. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm ruining everyone's fun. 
Let's keep going. 
Ok, jess. Moving on to the next 
question so we can move on to the gifts. 
What would tom say was the moment the two of you both fell in love? 
Well. Um, I can't say for sure 
what the moment for tom was. 
But I remember mine.  
it was the first grade. 
I was the new kid and kind of shy. 
I looked across the playground and there was tom. 
in blue overalls, sneakers and mismatched socks.  
i couldn't take my eyes off him.  
and not just because of the chocolate pudding all over his face.  
it was like time slowed down.  
he smiled at me and then all of a sudden he shouted - look out! 
And I turned and i just missed being puked on by kent paulsen.  
tom always has my back.  
that's one of the reasons why I married him. 
And it's been that way for as long as I can remember, I just... 
I didn't realize it until now. 
Others: ben: now a word about vermouth: personally, I never touch the stuff, but it's always good to have a little on hand for the ladies. 
Tom: he's doing the vermouth speech.  
this is brutal. 
Relax, man. 
Everyone loves him. 
Are you sure they're not just humouring him? 
Dude. That guy's 
taking notes.  
ben: let's say you find yourself after work with a date.  
no time to go home. 
Well, if you don't have any cologne, try rubbing a little lemon rind behind your ears. 
Where you goin'? 
This guy's awesome. 
Not like that old dude over there who's trying too hard. 
And another charitable donation to save the bark beetle. Thank you. 
I told my friends that you would probably want to do something good for the world rather than just collect these meaningless trinkets.  
god, this party sucks. 
Ok, so! Why don't 
we cut the cake! 
Where's judith? 
Oh, I think she's down for the night. 
Judith: say hello to a few late arrivals.  
jessie: what's going on? 
I thought you might like to meet some friends of mine from the neighbourhood. 
So which one is the lucky bride? 
Everyone? 
I'd like you all to meet jessie hill-bellow. 
My daughter-in-law. 
Mazel tov. 
Sorry, jessie. 
Just doing the best I can. 
Why are you crying? 
Because I'm never going to get a panini maker. 
Tom: where did you learn to hold your liquor like that? 
well, son? Your grandmother 
was a woman of hidden depths. 
Wicked party, tom. 
Hey, don't tell your mom I peed on her hydrangeas. 
When did you...? 
Those are your hydrangeas, phil. 
oh. 
Dad, I have to confess. 
I didn't invite anybody to our bachelor party. 
I know, son. 
You're unpopular, but you're not that unpopular. 
To be honest, I thought you'd embarrass me but, you didn't totally suck. 
This is a rite of passage in a young man's life to see his father as a man, not just a dad. 
So uh, when do I get that lesson on the perfect martini? 
When you're twenty-five. 
Hey! How was your night? 
I'm so glad to see you. 
I feel the same way. 
whoa! Look out! 
Well, all things considered it was a perfect day.  
really? It sounded 
pretty rough. 
You mad at jessie; jessie mad at you. 
Monica going through everybody's purses for cash. 
You do know when you say 'all things considered', you're not actually supposed to consider all things. 
Oh. Sorry, honey. 
I did get to relive one great memory, though. 
The moment that we first met. 
Ah... The chair lift. 
The gondola? 
Spain. 
Way to ruin the perfect day. 
But it wasn't a perf... 
Go to sleep, ben. 
chair lift...  
And just like that, everything's changed. 
How'd you sleep? 
Like Snow White. 
Wasn't she poisoned? 
Fine, like Snow White on her wedding night. 
Can you believe we're actually married? 
Somehow it hasn't fully sunk in. 
(MOTOWN STYLE SONG STARTS) Just be glad your father didn't take away your phone privileges. 
Why do you think I'm whispering? 
Hey, I have a wedding present for you. 
Come to the window. 
 When you ask me do I think of you Mr. 
Bellow. 
Mrs. 
Bellow. 
 I just wanna say like every day  Ooh. 
I've got mail. 
 Even though you've got someone it's true  It's all I do  Noooooooo. 
 Can we make one moment be forever?  
 I don't wanna stop  No, I don't wanna stop (GUITAR TAMBOURINE AND HAND CLAPS) BOY: Can we find a way that we could be together?  
GIRL: Is there any way that we could be together?  
BOTH: And oh by the way, baby, do you love me?  
Yes, I do! Yes, I do! 
Yes, I do!  
(MACHINE HUMMING) Dude? 
Can I have that? 
(MACHINE STOPS) Heh heh. You know, Philip, 
that piece of paper may claim we're technically related, but I'm not lending you my power tools. 
A Dustbuster isn't a tool. 
And it's the clippings I'm after. 
You've gotta learn to mulch, my man. 
Oh, well. 
Why throw garbage on my lawn when, well, that's what yours is for, huh? 
There you go. 
Aw, thanks dude. 
Or is it dude-in-law? 
Ho, neither. 
Oh, which reminds me: I've decided to call a little family meeting today. 
Noon. Our house? 
Be there? 
Aw, so we are family. 
Not for long, my friend. 
So we are friends. 
Oh for God's sake, just show up! 
It's nice when we can all spend time together like this. 
Mm yeah. 
I don't think they can hear you, Carter. 
Try shaking a box of condoms. 
We're making up for last night. 
Phone sex does not a honeymoon make. 
At least it was free. 
Carter pays five bucks a minute. 
JESSIE: The folks just needed time to get used to the fact that we eloped. 
I think they're coming around. 
From now on, I get to wake up to this face every day. 
Plus I got sex on tap 24/7. 
Ow! 
Or whenever Jessie wants it. 
So where are you two setting up your love nest? 
I'm thinking funky studio apartment somewhere downtown. 
You can't afford that. Look, why don't you 
just crash at the frat house with me? 
In an 8 X 10 room that smells like beer and feet? I'm gonna pass. 
Well, you were pretty pumped about it two months ago when we were planning on rooming together. 
Well, things change. Now I'm hoping 
for something a little more upscale. 
Paid for with what? 
Rainbows and kisses? 
Sorry we can't all be as grown-up as you and the frat boys. 
What do you call the fat one again? 
Knuckles? 
Spud? Tiny? 
Right? 
Jeez, Tom. Maybe when school starts 
they can teach you how to take a joke. 
And we call him Lumpy. 
I'm uh, also going to go to the washroom. 
What's with you and Carter? 
Nothing. He's just pissed that 
I'm not moving in with him. 
Are you sure that's all? 
What, you think this is because of the mefindingoutyou slept-with-him-thing? 
I told you, Jess. 
I'm over it. 
Ancient history. 
Good. 
Long forgotten. 
Glad to hear it. 
In the past. 
You're still talking. 
It's the furthest thing from my What? 
BEN: Let's get right to it, shall we? 
An annulment? 
Mm hm. 
Whose idea was this? 
We all discussed it and decided it was for the best. 
You didn't discuss it with me. 
Me neither. 
Fine. 
The Bellows discussed it and we all decided it was for the best. 
First I'm hearing of it. 
WENDY: Me too. 
It doesn't matter who discussed it. 
We're not getting an annulment. 
Yeah. We didn't make this 
decision lightly, you know. 
Oh, that's right. 
It was a dare. 
Maybe it isn't such a bad idea to get an annulment, Jess. 
You don't need a piece of paper to prove your love. 
Finally. 
Thank you, Phil. 
TARA: Yeah, you should sign the annulment, and then just shack up and see where it goes. 
Wait a minute; that is not what he meant! 
So when Tom moves out, do I get his room or what? 
If you get Tom's room, I need yours. 
My building has, like, zero storage space. 
BEN: Tom is not moving out because Tom can't afford to. 
You're starting college in a week, in case you've forgotten. 
You were gonna pay for me to live with Carter. 
Carter is not Jessie. 
You want to marry Carter, go ahead. 
No, wait. 
Scratch that. 
You know what? 
We're tired of defending this. 
Tom and I are married and we're going to stay that way no matter what happens. 
TOM: Exactly! 
Mom, Dad? 
You're just going to have to get used to the fact that I'm a grown man who makes his own decisions. 
Tom! 
Let's go. 
Coming. 
Does this mean I get Jessie's room? 
Who is he is again? 
He's our refugee from Iraq. 
Why is he here? 
My country has seen much political unrest since No! 
No, I mean in our house. 
Ben. Kitchen. 
Now. 
Are you out of your mind? 
Tom and Jessie can't live in the attic. 
That's mother's space. 
Ben. Your mother is not 
coming back from Palm Beach. 
She moved in with her plastic surgeon, remember? 
That man is not my father and never will be. 
Look. I don't like this 
thing any more than you. 
But at least this way we'll be able to keep an eye on Tom, make sure he's hitting the books. 
We'd get a pretty penny if we rented that space out. 
What would you rather invest in? 
Real estate or your son? 
Real estate's less risky. 
Fine. 
Little bastard doesn't know how lucky he is. 
The attic. 
You gotta be kidding. 
Our gift to you and Jessie. 
Mm hm. 
No strings attached. 
It's so... 
Pink. 
I would have gone with "generous". 
What about Grandma? 
She's dead. 
What! 
Dead to me, dead to me. 
Sorry. 
The point is we could get $800 a month if we leased this place out. 
But we'd rather have you focus on your education. 
So, Jessie? 
What do you think? 
I think it's... 
um, lovely. Tom? 
I would sooner have my testicles ripped off by a raccoon. 
Now I understand why you wanted to discuss this in private. 
I can't believe you called this "lovely." 
Who are you, Dame Judy Dench? 
I was struggling, OK? 
They're just trying to help, Tom. 
Jessie, I can't be my own man if I'm living in my parents' house! 
Lots of men live with their parents. 
Yes, and they are called "losers." 
This place, it's all pink. 
And it smells funny, and everything is sitting on a doily. 
Oh! 
Including the doilies. 
So? Ditch the lace, maybe 
knock down a couple walls, give it a cool paint job. 
Here, help me move this couch by the window where there's more light. 
Careful. 
(SQUEAKING PLASTIC) See? 
Better already. 
Seriously, Tom. 
We can make this work. 
Great! 
I'll go pack. 
(GROAN) TARA: The attic? 
Isn't that where Norman Bates kept his mother? 
So it's not perfect. 
At least we can both focus on school and not have to worry about money. 
(SIGH) We love that you love Tom. 
It's just we don't want you to become a cliche. 
Exactly. You guys should be driving 
across Mexico on a motorbike. 
Also a cliche. 
Reading Kerouac, thumbing rides across the country. 
Cliche, cliche. 
Drinking absinthe, running with the coyotes, building wicker people in the desert and lighting them on fire! 
Clich-- Actually, I don't know what the hell that is. 
Sweetie. We just want you to be 
happy with your life. That's all. 
And doing what's right for me and Tom does make me happy. 
Am I the only one who thinks this is a good idea? 
Adios, boy wallpaper! 
(TUNE ON KAZOO)  Really, Tom? 
Aw, crap. 
Here we go. 
Come on, Tom. 
Can you at least try to put a positive spin on this? 
Ha. 
Good point. 
If we're gonna do this, let's do it right. 
Whoa! 
Where'd you learn that move? 
Gone With The Wind? 
Shrek. 
(GIGGLE) Um, Tom. 
Now's not really a good time. 
Why not? 
We need to christen the place. 
And not in a Jesus-y way, if you know what I mean. 
No I know, it's just I kind of arranged... 
Hola, amigos! 
(GOOFY LAUGH) A surprise housewarming. 
Nice pad. 
Is this OK? 
Yeah. 
Carter's here. 
I love... 
Carter. 
Hey. 
Dig the doilies. 
(30'S JAZZ)  You know there is still room at the frat house. 
I like it here. 
Well, I guess home is where the heart is. 
Yeah I know, you can really smell the (SNIFF) Grandma. 
You know what I like about your Grandma jokes, Carter? 
You don't waste any time trying to make them funny. 
So when's "lights out" around here? 
I just assume you two have a curfew. 
It beats living with ten other guys. 
At least we have some privacy. 
JUDITH: Yoo hoo! 
Who wants pizza-pops? 
(GASP) There we go. 
Oh, I'd fold with a hand like that if I were you, sweetie. 
The pizza was one thing, but did she have to make cupcakes? 
Your mom's just excited. 
Now what were you saying about christening the place? 
(KNOCK ON DOOR) Sorry to disturb. 
I saw the light on and thought I'd grab my plates. 
Uh. Sure. 
Come in. 
I mean, it's not locked. 
Because, you know, there is no lock. 
Oh. Tom, you'll have to help your 
father move the couch back tomorrow. 
We don't want it to fade in the sunlight. 
(GASP) Will you look at that? 
That's the blanket your dad and I used on our wedding night. 
(WHIMPER) Is there any point in starting over? 
Nope. 
OK. 
Mom, Dad? 
We need to talk. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the attic. 
Yeah. Hold that thought. I'm late for court, 
and I need your help around the house. 
Starting with the lawn. 
You can graze cattle out there. 
Yes, OK, but Don't forget to move Bubbe's couch back. 
See, the thing is... 
Oh, and Tom, we have tickets to the ballet this evening and Wendy's having some friends over. 
Can you keep an eye on them, since you're home anyway? 
Well, I won't be home; I'll be in the attic. 
Same difference. 
OK, that's it. 
I've just made a decision. 
Oh. 
That's nice, sweetie. 
First: I'm moving out. 
BEN: We've been over this, Tom. 
You can't afford a place of your own while you're going to college, remember? 
Which brings me to number two. 
I'm sorry, but I am quitting college. 
Great. 
Now we can't go to the ballet. 
Oh, we're going to the ballet. 
Dammit. 
I can't believe you didn't consult me before making such a big decision. 
I can always re-enrol next semester. 
And in the meantime I'll find a job, save some cash so we can finally move into a place where we actually feel like adults. 
What floor is this apartment on, anyway? 
Fourteenth. But don't worry, the 
elevator's not always gonna be broken. 
(CHUCKLE) You must be new. 
What a dump. 
It wasn't a dump. 
It had character. 
If by character you mean silverfish. 
OK, new plan: Let's say I dip slightly further into my savings and we look for a place a little more out of our price range. 
That place was out of our price range. 
Really? 
But it was a dump and it had silverfish. 
I think you should just admit to your father that you made a mistake and we'll move back to the attic. 
Go crawling back? 
I'm trying to man-up here, Jess. 
I'd appreciate a little support. 
You wanna man-up? 
You're going to have to consider other options. 
Such as? 
JESSIE: Thanks for helping us out, Carter. 
Hey, it's the least I can do to help out a couple of young marrieds, huh? 
Hey, uh, I'll be upstairs if you guys need me. 
Why are you doing this to me? 
What? We need help and Carter offered. 
He's being nice. 
He's not being nice; he's being a jerk. 
CARTER: Oh. By the way, we're having 
a little get-together tonight. 
You guys should hang out. 
Yeah, we can't. 
Jessie and I have to We'd love to. 
She must've run out of room in her suitcase. 
Her first Save The Pandas panda. 
I know we're supposed to be progressive, but it kinda feels like she just got here. 
This is what happens when you raise an independent and intelligent young woman. 
Would it kill her to be a little dumber and needier? 
There are perks to Jessie being gone. 
Like what? 
Like more privacy. 
Privacy's overrated. 
More experimentation. 
You know I don't like new things. 
We can walk around naked. 
Why would we wanna do that? 
(SIGH) Do you wanna have sex or not? 
Oh... 
yeah! 
(YELLING PARTY GOERS) Cheers. 
Great party. 
Great attitude. 
Maybe I don't want to party. 
Some of us have to be adults. 
You're forgetting; some people are helping certain adults out. 
I don't need your charity. 
Said the guy living in my basement. 
I know you may not think much of this marriage, but it beats living in some lame campus sex comedy. 
Yeah, except that it doesn't. 
It really, really doesn't. 
You can have all the endless I'll take that. 
girls, Carter. 
Because we both know I've got the only one who counts. 
Hey, don't poke me. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Do you not like being poked? 
What's being poked? 
Now this is happening. 
Back off, Bellow. 
(SHOUTING AND TOPPLING BOTTLES) Guys! 
Guys! 
Nice, Tom. 
Real mature. 
Jessie. 
It's a party! 
Yeah! 
(CHEERS) JESSIE: You told me you were over the whole Carter thing. 
I tried! 
It's just I keep picturing it. 
Him touching you. 
You letting him. 
You touching him. 
Thanks, I know how it goes. 
You know, for a guy who's trying to man up, you're acting like a child. 
Don't put it all on me, OK? 
You could've told me about the Carter thing a long time ago and you didn't. 
You're right. But you know it happened 
long before you and I got together. 
Yeah, but don't you see? 
Now, no matter what happens, Carter Boyd will always be your first. 
You really don't get it, do you? 
Where are you going? 
Back to my room. 
Why? 
Where else am I supposed to go? 
We can't stay at the frat house. 
We can't stay in the attic and we don't have a place of our own. 
So guess what, Tom, we're back to square one. 
I'm almost done. 
Are you sure you don't mind me taking Jessie's room? 
Our home is your home. 
Thank you. 
Everything OK, kiddo? 
Tom and I kind of had a fight. 
Would it be OK if I crash here? 
Of course, sweetie. 
Let's go make up your bed, OK? 
So it's back to the basement, huh? 
Yeah. 
OK. 
 (PIANO & MALE SINGER) I'm missing feeling in such a bad way  The world is getting colder  and the mirror's growing older  I don't know what to do. 
I just keep thinking how I'm lucky to have you.  
Hey. 
You know some people share a different point of view  Hey. 
And it trips me like an untied shoe  Party detritus. 
Also I had to kill a guy, cut him up. 
Yeah, you know the deal. 
Look, I was a jackass last night. 
I've been having an issue with something. 
Yeah, you and Jessie? 
More like you and Jessie. 
I can't believe she told you. 
Although the chest-poking thing should've tipped me off. 
Look man, it was a one-shot deal, OK? 
And it was way before you guys ever even hooked up. 
Yeah. 
I know that now. 
But I convinced myself that you were jealous of losing her, so I rubbed it in. 
(SIGH) Dude, I was worried about losing someone. 
But it wasn't Jessie. 
What? 
You changing teams on me? 
Yeah, you wish. 
One last question and I want an honest answer. 
What do you really think of this marriage? 
Look, what I think doesn't really matter, OK? 
It's what she thinks that counts. 
But for the record, I think it's nuts. 
Noted. 
Foozball? 
Dad? 
(DOOR CLOSES) I'd like to make you an offer. 
I'm listening. 
I've decided to stay in school. 
And in the attic... 
if you'll still have us. 
Go on. 
But I want to pay rent. 
Now, I can't afford as much as you'd get from someone else, but I'd like to offset that with pre-negotiated chores. 
Say mowing the lawn? 
Twice weekly. 
Plus garbage. 
Weekly. 
Plus garbage, no recycling. 
Garbage, recycling and taking your mother to the ballet. 
Recycling. 
No ballet. 
Dammit. 
(SONG CONTINUES) Don't be afraid to change  I can't believe how much my life's been rearranged  Sometimes it seems the dream is falling out of range  How could you know the world could be so strange.  
Don't be afraid to change. 
Don't be afraid to change. 
Don't be afraid to change. 
(SONG FADES OUT) Oh my God! 
What happened to the pink palace? 
Well? Like you said, knock 
down a couple of walls, give it a cool paint job and you've got a fresh start. 
And your own private line. 
From now on, we call before we visit. 
Your father and I got this in Mexico. 
We thought it might just liven the place up. 
Sorry about the smell. 
So now we'll give you two some space. 
Yeah. 
How did you...? 
I took a part time job at the Juicebar so I could kick my dad some rent. 
And uh ... 
I'm staying in school. 
Tom, that's great! 
Someone's gettin' laid tonight. 
The space thing. 
Right. 
Thanks, Carter. 
Mr. 
Bellow. 
Mrs. 
Bellow. 
Look Jessie, I know Carter will always be your first. 
But you know what? 
I'm OK with that. 
Really. 
Good. 
Because he may be my first but um... 
you, Tom Bellow, will always be my last. 
What were you saying about christening the place? 
Something's not working. 
Should we put it back? 
And admit your mother was right? 
That'd be sending the wrong message. 
Well, it's gotta fit somewhere. 
Last time, I swear! 
(DRUM BEAT STARTS)  (MALE SINGER) Don't look down, we'll hit the town real soon  (KNOCKS AND RATTLING) JUDITH: Anybody hungry? 
I've got cheese bagel.
