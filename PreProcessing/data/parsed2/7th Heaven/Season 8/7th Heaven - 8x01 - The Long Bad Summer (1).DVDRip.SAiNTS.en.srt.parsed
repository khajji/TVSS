1 TWINS: Daddy! 
Daddy! Daddy! 
Daddy! 
Hi, guys. 
(dog whines) How you doing? 
I'm okay. How are you? 
Okay. 
As okay as any of us. 
Looks like it's going to be a nice day today. 
Where's Simon? 
Please, it's the last day of vacation. 
Simon... 
I don't want to be on vacation. 
I don't want to have a picnic on the beach. 
I'm gonna keep saying this to you until I get through to you: it was an accident. 
(sighs)  7th Heaven   When I see their happy faces   Smiling back at me   7th Heaven   I know there's no greater feeling   Than the love of family   Where can you go   When the world don't treat you right?  
 The answer is home   That's the one place that you'll find   7th Heaven   Mmm, 7th Heaven   7th Heaven.  
(barks)   (both laugh) I love you. 
I love you, too. 
It's been a tough summer. 
You know, ever since you told me you thought that you might be pregnant, I felt really happy, not that you weren't pregnant, but because you will be someday. 
Someday, you and I will have children together, and I can't wait. 
Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to. 
We're due downstairs for some more family fun. 
What do you think? 
About? 
About having children? 
I still have two years of school left. 
I think we'd better wait until I get out of school. 
If that's what you want. 
It's not what I want. 
What I want is to have a baby. 
I haven't been able to stop thinking about it ever since the scare either. 
No, we can't. 
We really can't. 
I could baby-sit while you go to class. 
(chuckles) No, I could. 
Are you serious? 
You want to have a baby? 
I need something life-affirming. 
We all do. 
Do you have any kings? 
N... no. 
Yes, he does. 
No, I don't. 
Are you sure? 
If you have a card with a king on it, you have to give it to Ruthie. 
I'm sure. 
Sorry this is the last day of vacation. 
It's been really fun. 
This is the best vacation I've ever had. 
I'm really glad you came. 
I'm really glad you invited me. 
(boys making kissing sounds) Why you guys want to give me a hard time huh? 
Because we love you. 
We love you. 
And you love Ruthie. 
You love Ruthie. 
(making kissing sounds) (boys laughing) I just wish I didn't feel so guilty about having a good time. 
I feel badly for Simon, too, but I'm still having a good time. 
What are you doing here? 
Uh, I was wondering what you were doing here. 
We have the house until Sunday. 
Uh, you had the house till Saturday, and it's, uh, late Saturday. 
And we're here because it's our turn. 
We're not going home until tomorrow. 
What about church? 
We'll be home in time for church. 
You said you wanted to be home for the weekend. 
Did I? Uh, I meant I wanted 
to be home for Sunday. 
Well, it's a very long drive. 
We just can't turn around and go back. 
No, no, of course not. 
Uh, come on in. 
Oh, no, no, I don't want to spoil your last night here, which was supposed to be last night. 
I wouldn't want to spoil your first night here, which is supposed to be tomorrow night. 
ROXANNE: How are you doing? 
How do you think I'm doing? 
I was just making polite conversation. 
But if you want to, we can talk. 
I've been worried about you. 
I wish everyone would stop worrying about me. 
It just makes it worse. 
To have people care about you? 
I don't want anybody to care about me. 
Not even Cecilia? 
No, not even Cecilia. 
Simon, don't do this to yourself. 
I killed someone. 
And don't say it was an accident... 
Because it was an accident that happened when I was driving. 
I'm responsible for killing someone. 
How's he doing? 
Not so well. 
When do you go to court? 
Next week. 
Unless our insurance company settles, and they don't want to settle. 
Does Simon have to go? 
He doesn't have to go. 
but I think he should. 
It was an accident. 
Look, I almost forgot why you were on this vacation. 
Roxanne and I will get a hotel and we'll come back tomorrow. 
No, you should just stay here. 
No, you spend your last night with your family, all right? 
I'm sorry about the mix-up. 
No, there are plenty of rooms here for everyone. 
There's a room for you... 
and a room for Roxanne. 
Unless, of course, you decide to get married tonight. 
Ah, we'll just leave and come back. 
Come back married? 
I don't want to get into this right now... again. 
Okay. No judgment. 
You don't know that we're doing anything. 
She's not sure if she wants to get married right now. 
Depends on whether or not the fun lasts? 
What time are you leaving tomorrow? 
No matter when we leave, whether we're here or not, God knows what you're doing. 
God does, but none of you do. 
We're hungry. 
Yeah, we're hungry. 
You just ate. 
The beach makes me hungry all the time. 
When are we eating dinner? 
In an hour or so. How about a snack? 
What's for dinner? 
Whatever your mom wants to cook. 
She's sleeping. 
If she sleeps until tomorrow morning, we won't have dinner. 
Well, she won't do that. 
She only did that once, and we still ate, didn't we? 
There's nothing wrong with banana sandwiches for dinner. 
We're at the beach. 
We're on vacation. 
Oh, I get it, you want me to drive you somewhere and get you something to eat. 
Something good. 
In case there's no dinner. 
Okay, come on. 
I'm taking Sam and David to Captain Crabby's Crab House for a snack. You want to go? 
You hungry already? 
No, but they're hungry. 
I'll take 'em. 
Forget it. 
What? 
Because I saw the look on your face, Dad, that's why. 
If it was just an accident, then why are you so scared to let Sam and David drive with me? 
Why is everyone frightened every time I get behind the wheel? 
That's not true. 
I wasn't going that fast, Dad. 
I wasn't going any faster than anyone else. 
I didn't see him okay? 
I didn't see him. 
He came out of nowhere. 
We heard Simon. 
I'll go talk to him. 
No, let me go this time. 
I think it's my turn. 
No. it's not your turn. 
You've had too many turns. 
This hasn't even been a vacation for you. 
BOTH: I thought we were going to Captain Crabby's. 
I'll take 'em. 
Kevin can talk to Simon, and you should get a nap. 
This is your last afternoon to get a nap. 
Come on, guys. 
I hear they're giving away free pirate hats. 
Want to go? 
All right, let's go! 
I don't know how we're gonna get him through this. 
I don't know how we're gonna get us and the rest of our family through this. 
(sleepy murmuring) It's okay. I-I, I 
wasn't talking to her. 
I was talking to You. 
I'll be right here. 
  My gosh. I'll get dinner. 
We already had dinner. 
Would you like something? 
Uh...  
Mom and I made vegetable soup and cornbread, and we saved you a brownie. 
Annie came down? 
Then she went back up. 
Well, that, that's good. 
Then she hasn't been asleep for the 12 hours I thought she had. 
I'll get you some soup. 
I got it. 
What time  did the twins pass out? 
PETER: 11:30. 
More like 8:30. 
Well, you know, I'll take them upstairs. 
I'll take them up. 
Oh. Okay. 
By the way, Cecilia's here. 
She just got here. 
How's that going? 
Not that well. 
They took it down to the beach, though. 
If I wanted to talk to you, I would have called you. 
You shouldn't have driven all the way down here. 
I had to. I can't stand 
knowing you're in so much pain and not being able to be with you and talk to you. 
It's been three months. 
How many times do I have to say it? 
I don't want to talk to you. 
I don't want to talk to anyone. 
Then fine, we won't talk, but can't I just be with you? 
No. 
Look, just... just stay away. 
Okay? Find a new boyfriend, 
someone people don't hate. 
People don't hate you. 
It was an accident. 
Everyone knows it was an accident. 
Doesn't matter. 
School starts on Monday and it's gonna be a living hell for me. 
Why make it the same way for yourself? 
You're better off without me. 
What? 
You think I'm feeling sorry for myself? 
'Cause I'm not! 
I'm feeling sorry for the kid I ran over and his brother and his parents. 
I'm sure Justin is grieving for his brother, Simon, but he's been in school with you for four years. 
He knows you're not a bad guy. 
He knows you didn't mean to do it. 
Really? 
Do you think he's  that understanding? 
Do you think anyone's that understanding? 
Because if it had been me and some guy and his car had come along and hit Ruthie, you think I just would have went up to him at school and said, "It's okay, I know you didn't mean to do it"? 
(telephone ringing) Hello? 
Yes, this is Officer Kinkirk. 
Is that you, Detective Michaels? 
I'll let Eric know. 
He can decide how he wants to handle it. 
Thanks for finding me. 
Good night. 
(sighs) Okay, make it snappy. 
Church starts in one hour. 
Come on, babes. 
(clearing throat) I'm just gonna help Ruthie take her stuff up. 
(telephone ringing) Hello. 
How'd it go? 
We had it cleaned up by sunrise. 
I don't think too many people saw it. 
Really? 
Even if people did see it, they wouldn't just, er... call 
and tell Simon, do you think? 
(sighs) Well, I'll talk to him after church. 
I probably won't make it. 
I'm gonna come home and get some sleep. 
I understand. 
Thanks. 
What? 
We found out who painted the church sign, not that it was too hard to figure out. 
The kid's brother, Justin? 
Yeah. 
Have the Camdens considered having Simon transfer to another school? 
Eric's been working on it, but Simon doesn't want a transfer. 
He doesn't want to go to school, period. 
When's the trial start? 
Jury selection begins tomorrow. 
Trial will probably start Tuesday or Wednesday. 
I can't understand why the insurance company doesn't just pay. 
The family wants more than they want to pay. 
No matter how much they get, it won't bring their son back. 
I just wish it hadn't have been Simon. 
But it was, and nothing we can do can change that. 
How are we gonna do that? 
Why are you asking me? 
Then I'm gonna take the shower first? 
Yes, and then I'll shower. 
What's going on? 
Nothing. 
Nothing. 
I mean, we were just discussing some things. 
Showering and things. 
I don't want to go to church today. 
I've gone every Sunday all summer. 
I don't want to go today. 
I want to stay home and I want some time to myself. 
I need some time to myself. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay? 
Its okay I don't go to church? 
Is there a reason its okay I don't go to church? 
You just said you needed some time to yourself. 
But do you have a reason? 
You know, fine. 
I don't need a reason. 
See ya. 
Shouldn't you be getting ready for church? 
Yeah, I am as soon as Annie's out of the shower. 
Did you tell Simon? 
No, I didn't tell Simon. 
Maybe you should before someone else does. 
After church. 
I'll tell him after church. 
What happens if someone else tells him at church? 
Simon's not going to church. 
Neither am I. 
Kevin's been up all night and I just want to be there for him when he gets home. 
You can't be there for him after church? 
What does that mean? 
It means you got the rest of your lives and today is Sunday... 
What if Simon needs someone and no one's home? 
It's been a tough summer and Kevin and I need some time to do something... 
live-affirming. 
Like? 
You're not thinking of doing something life-affirming like, uh... having 
a baby, are you? 
What would make you think that? 
I just think that. 
You have plenty  of time to have a baby  after you finish school. 
It's been a hard summer for all of us. 
We all need something life-affirming, and I'm sure God will provide in ways other than... children 
being born to mothers who are still in college and who want to finish their degree before starting a family. 
All right, already. 
I'll go. 
We really could use a little... 
uplifting distraction, You know. 
Uh... Look, dealer's choice. 
I'm going home now! 
I'll see you in church! 
I'm surprised he doesn't keep a change of clothes in the house. 
Call if you need a ride! 
I need more of a life-affirming distraction than dealing with teen love. 
Just... 
Peter! You forgot your bag! 
Uh!  
Sorry. 
I was just trying to get up the nerve to knock on the front door. 
Don't I know you from somewhere? 
Do you remember that Christmas when your sister, Mary, brought me home from the shelter? 
And then your family helped me return to New York to my own family? 
Barely. So you're just 
here to thank us? 
Well, not exactly. 
It's Carlos, isn't it? 
Yes. Yes, and if I remember 
correctly, you're Ruthie. 
Only... 
when I knew you then, you were just a little girl and now you're a young woman. 
A young woman chasing after a young man. 
Sorry. Don't let me stop you. 
This can wait. 
It's waited all summer. 
No. This bag can wait. 
Please. 
Sit down. Let's talk. 
Oh. 
And not necessarily a distraction. 
Maybe something real. 
Something wonderful that would lift us all. 
Heal us all. 
Maybe if I could rise above the darkness that's fallen over us for an entire season... 
maybe I could do something to help Simon. 
Maybe I could help that family in their grief. 
Anything, I'll take anything. 
Shower's free. 
That's a start. 
I love you and I want to marry you. 
And it's just not enough just to be with you. 
I want us to be husband and wife. 
I'm sorry about your dad. 
Come on, Roxanne, this has nothing to do with my father dying. 
It's about me and you. 
I just can't help but feel you want a family because of what happened. 
And I just can't help but feel that you keep using this as an excuse. 
Knowing that I wanted to marry you before I even knew my father was sick. 
This is not about what anyone thinks of me or thinks of you or anything other than that I love you, and I want to marry you, and I want to have babies with you. 
And-and-and... 
And I want to keep doing this for the rest of our lives. 
I'll be here when you get home. 
Wake me up. 
Definitely. 
By the way, who is that guy I saw on the front porch talking to Ruthie? 
Ruthie's talking to a guy on the front porch? 
Tall guy, my age, maybe younger I didn't get a good look. 
Oh, you know, it might have been what's his name, Carlos. 
So you've been keeping a little secret from me, huh? 
(clearing throat) Oh yeah, nice sermon. 
I'm just going to say good-bye to Ruthie. 
She was kind of quiet in church. 
That's the way it's supposed to be. 
It's a place of worship. 
A lot of talk going around just the same, even though it's a place of worship. 
Someone painted the church sign last night. 
Simon know? 
No, but I plan to tell him so I hope no one else will tell him first. 
Not to worry. 
I won't say anything. 
Not even to Ruthie? 
She already knows. 
It wasn't me. 
She overheard what I overheard. 
What else are people saying? 
They feel really badly for that kid's family. 
But they also feel badly for Simon and your family. 
What else? 
Everyone thinks Chandler and Roxanne should get married. 
Or he should break up with that hussy. 
I'm quoting. 
It was some older women talking. 
They use words like that-- hussy. 
Are they calling Chandler any names? 
No, they seem to like him. 
Anything else? 
Well, they were talking about Mary, but they're always talking about Mary. 
I think she may be the most popular person on the church gossip circuit. 
Yeah, so what's the gossip now? 
They're just wondering why she hasn't been around all summer. 
You know with everything happening to Simon and all. 
Why do they think she hasn't been around? 
There are lots of theories. 
My favorite is that she's a spy. 
For? 
France. 
Yeah. 
Makes as much sense as anything else. 
How is it that you hear all this stuff and I don't? 
Just always at the right place at the right time I guess. 
You know you can't keep a secret. 
Yes, I can. 
I know stuff, okay? 
What stuff? 
If I told you I would be proving your point, and if I don't tell you, I'll be proving my point. 
How did you get him to tell you? 
One, I'm me and two, he's ready to tell the world. 
Mary doesn't want to be married. 
She wants an annulment. 
An annulment? 
When's the last time you talked to her? 
Why? 
Because maybe she changed her mind. 
Why would she change her mind? 
Isn't it obvious? 
(knocking) Hey, we missed you in church today. 
You can come even when Simon doesn't. 
We're always happy to have you there. 
You okay? 
I'm not sure. 
I might have done something really, really bad. 
You want to tell me about it? 
Yes, that's why I'm here to tell you about it. 
Is Simon upstairs? 
Do you know where Simon is? 
You know neither Annie nor I are in a good place right now emotionally. 
We're both rather exhausted. 
But I'm in a better place than she is and I'd say she'll be down here momentarily to make lunch for everyone. 
I took him to the airport. 
The airport? 
Why? 
Because he asked me to and I love him, and I would do anything for him. 
Do you happen to know if he'll be back in time for school tomorrow? 
I don't think so. 
He's going to New York to see Matt. 
Who is going to New York to see Matt? 
Simon. 
I left my Bible. 
Always in the right place at the right time again? 
It's a curse. 
So what's the plan? 
I'll let you know. 
You'll let me know? 
I don't think so. 
I'll let you know after I talk to Mary. 
After I talk to Carlos. 
He can't go to New York. 
He's got school tomorrow. 
Wait! Wait! 
I want to talk to you! 
What else do you know? 
What else? 
You overheard the conversation about Simon going to New York. 
Honest, I didn't mean to. 
What else didn't you mean to hear? 
What do you mean? 
I mean you found out something when you were up in the attic, didn't you? 
Whoa, what do you have like super powers? 
Some days, yes. 
Now what was it? 
I can't, Reverend Camden. 
Trust me, I can't. 
It would mean the end of my relationship with Ruthie and that would mean the end of my world as I know it. 
Meeting Ruthie, being with this family, is the best thing that's happened to me since my dad left. 
Please, please don't ask me to tell you. 
No, no, I won't ask you, Peter. 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean to upset you. 
It's okay. 
You can go home now. 
I didn't mean to frighten you. 
I apologize for even asking you to tell me something that obviously my daughter or daughters don't want me to know. 
Thanks, Reverend. 
Oh. 
and just so you know, it's daughters. 
You said daughter or daughters don't want you to know. 
Oh, so it's both of them. 
It's all three of them? 
You were saying Simon's on his way to New York? 
I just wanted to say good-bye to Peter. 
I'll call Matt. 
What good is that going to do? 
Well, Matt will make him come home. 
Who is he the Wizard of Oz? 
Well, what do you want me to do? 
Well, I want you to go and get him. 
You want me to go all the way to New York when Matt can just put Simon back on the plane? 
One of us is going! 
It's not going to be me! 
Well, it's not going to be me either. 
We've been waiting all summer long to have a fight so why don't we just have it now, while Simon is out of the house? 
Oh, so that's what you've been waiting for Simon to get out of the house. 
Couldn't you have just asked him to get out of the house so you could say to me whatever it is you wanted to say to me since May? 
I know what you want to say to me! 
You want to say it's my fault. 
That if I had left with the rest of the family that I would have been driving and Paul Smith would still be alive. 
Isn't that what you want to say? 
That you blame me for this? 
What if I had left with the family? 
What if I had been driving? 
What if I had killed Paul Smith? 
What if it were me instead of Simon? 
What if it never happened if I'd been driving this never would have happened, right? 
Annie, we can't afford to play what if. 
We have to stay with what is, and what is, is our son was driving when he came around a curve and Paul Smith wasn't looking where he was going. 
And now-- one life is changed forever and one life is over. 
We're the lucky ones, Annie. 
We're the lucky ones. 
Simon's life may be changed forever, but he's still alive. 
All I wanted to say was why couldn't those parents make sure that their son was wearing a helmet? 
We have a problem. 
Okay. 
She knows. 
Okay. 
RUTHIE: Carlos is waiting for me to call him and tell him when he can come over and talk to Mom and Dad. 
Okay. 
Okay? 
Don't you think it's about time they knew? 
Don't you think it should be Mary who tells them? 
I think she's not going to tell them and somebody is going to have to tell them before everyone knows but them. 
Let Carlos tell them. 
Then I should at least warn them. 
And how are you going to do that? 
KEVIN: This is between Carlos and Mary and your mom and dad and if Carlos wants to tell them, let him tell them. 
Then I think you should be there because they don't need any more bad news. 
KEVIN: I don't think this is necessarily bad news, is it? 
Why do you think he's in such a rush to tell them? 
Yeah. Why now? 
Why? Because it's been months 
since they got married. 
Don't you think you're being a little naïve? 
We think that maybe they're Don't even say it. 
That's ridiculous. 
They're not pregnant. 
Marry me. 
You know I'm going to marry you. 
You've been saying that you're going to marry me, but I want to know for certain that you're going to marry me. 
I want to buy you a ring. 
I want to set a date. 
All right. 
How's next May or June or August or a year from now? 
How's next week or next month or the end of the year? 
I'm just not in a hurry. 
I mean, I like things the way they are. 
Things will be the way they are only we'll be married. 
Nothing's going to change. 
Is that what you're afraid of? 
Or is it, uh, that you like that you can just walk away from this, uh, with things like they are? 
I can't keep doing this, Roxanne. 
I love you, but I can't. 
Let's get married, or... 
Or? 
(laughing): Planning on moving in? 
I'm looking for Matt Camden. 
He's a medical student; he works here, I think. 
He's not here. 
He and his wife went up to the Berkshire's for a little R&R. 
Oh. 
That's an uh-oh? 
Maybe I should have called. 
Are you a friend or a Camden? 
I'm a Camden. 
I'm Matt's brother, Simon. 
As in the Bank of Simon? 
Oh, hon, I know all about the Camdens. 
There's Matt, Mary, Lucy, you, Ruthie, Sam and David. 
Matt and I are very close. 
I'm the one who told your dad he was going to be a grandpa. 
When he wasn't. 
Oh. 
So, run away from home? 
Not exactly. 
Do your parents know where you are? 
Probably. 
I don't know. 
My ex-girlfriend Cecilia was supposed to tell them. 
You want to call them? 
Not really, no. 
Why don't you call Mary and Carlos? 
Maybe you can stay with them. 
I'm sorry, Mary a-and who? 
I never said anything. 
She's living with a guy? 
I know nothing. 
Well, are they married? 
I hope so. 
Oh, got to go! 
The phone's on the desk. 
Help yourself, bye! 
(doorbell ringing) I'm-I'm-I'm very surprised to see you. 
Uh, please come in. 
Would you like to sit down? 
Well, I suppose you came here for some reason. 
Is there anything I can do? 
Anything we can do for you? 
We're going to accept the offer from your insurance company. 
We don't think that any amount of money can replace our son. 
And while we hoped to get more because, in our anger, we wanted to punish your family and Simon, we don't want to go to court. 
Paul should've been wearing a helmet. 
We reminded him always to wear a helmet, but he didn't wear a helmet. 
He never wore a helmet when he rode his bike. 
But wearing or not wearing a helmet didn't seem important. 
Not when we were dealing with much bigger problems with Paul. 
Y-You don't, you don't have to tell me. 
 No, we want to tell the truth. 
It's the right thing to do. 
We hope that we can do the right thing so our other son will do the right thing. 
Justin. 
Justin painted your church sign. 
We'll pay to have it repainted. 
That's, uh, that's not necessary. 
I-It's been taken care of. 
He had a problem with drugs. 
Paul. 
The autopsy shows that, um, he was under the influence of drugs. 
So, while your son, Simon, may have been guilty of not paying attention, our son, Paul, was guilty, too. 
I had no idea. 
It would have come out in the trial, but we'd rather just let you know. 
ERIC: Still, you didn't have to. 
I didn't have to know the reason why you decided not to go to court. 
ANNE: I-It probably won't help Simon to know this, you know, we want you to tell him, but... 
No, he's still going to be dealing with a lot. 
And for more than just a few years. 
Maybe even for a lifetime. 
But... that's just the thing, 
he still has a lifetime. 
DON: Our other son, Justin, he's a good boy, a good student, a good person. 
But he had this thing about trying to help his brother with his drug problems and he thought he was making progress before the accident and, well, now he's got a lot of anger directed towards Simon and he's out of control. 
We have him in grief counseling with us as a family and private sessions just for him as well, but it's not going that well. 
And we don't want another tragedy on our hands. 
We tried to talk him out of going back to school, but he won't hear of it. 
He could transfer, but it's not going to happen. 
So, what we're hoping is maybe, if you and your wife and your son would consider it, maybe Simon could go somewhere else this year. 
Because frankly, Reverend Camden, we're afraid that Justin will do something stupid. 
I don't think that he would physically hurt Simon, but we really can't be sure. 
We'd just like to remove the temptation, hope that in time the therapy works and he can get through this. 
We hope we can all get through this, without any more trouble. 
We can't take another event in our lives. 
We're exhausted. 
Simon decided to take off for New York to see his brother, our oldest son, Matt. 
Simon doesn't want to go to school. 
My wife and I have been trying to make him. So... 
well, we'll stop doing that right now. 
And we'll figure out some alternative. 
It seems that's the very least we can do. 
(sighs) That's all we really wanted. 
Thanks. 
Thank you for coming over here. 
And thank you for dropping the court battle. 
And thank you... 
for trying to protect Simon. 
God bless you. 
And again, my deepest sympathies. 
I'm very sorry about your son. 
Thank You. 
Now, if you could just help me find Simon?
