Donny, you miss me, don�t you? 
Of course I do. I can't 
get my mind off you.

Chess club? Donny, you're cool 
at Naval college, aren't you? 
Are you kidding? I'm way cool.

I was gonna say, 'Pass the salt.' 
Pudding. Mmm. 
Sometimes� all you need is a little spice. 
That's deep. 
 No. 
No, it's wide. If I went 
deep, you couldn't find me. 
What does that mean? 
I don't know. 
I'm Bridget. 
 Damian. 
There's something you should know, I'm kind of an outcast right now. 
I�m thinking about buying a motorcycle. 
Hennessy! 
Just the man I wanna see. 
How would you like to turn... 
Tommy, I'm having a bad day. 
 Poor me. You're having a bad day. 
I'm on sexual harassment probation thanks to what�s her name� 'Boobs' in reception. 
Listen� how would you like to turn five hundred bucks into three thousand dollars by Monday morning? 
Tom. - It�s guaranteed. 
 Tommy, no. 
What's wrong, pal? 
 Oh, hey, Paul.  Fred? 
Hey, the receptionist with the big front porch sent me up. 
Hey, you look like a smart fella. How�d you like to turn 
Tommy! - Okay. 
 Sit down, Fred.  Oh, thank you. 
Is there any special reason you�re dropping by? 
Well, I kinda read between the lines last night, when you slammed the door in our faces. 
I�m so sorry, Fred, I... 
 No problem. 
Yeah, I kinda sensed your stress, well what with you and Cate and your impending fatherhood potentiality. 
Well, nothing�s, nothing's for sure. 
Yeah, I know. Well, I 
picked up on that too. 
Fred, I don�t really need... 
 You see, me and Mary Ellen, well, we can't have kids of our own. 
I had no idea. All 
your kids are adopted? 
Yeah. Yeah. We� 
�we think Donny's a Kennedy. 
I just came down to tell you that I think you're a good father. 
Yeah, I've seen you. 
And besides, you're not in this alone, you know. 
You and, you and Cate are in it together. 
Two peas in a pod, as it were. 
Listen, I better shove off, boy and oh, yeah� if you�re finished with the cake, Mary Ellen would like her pan back. 
Oh my god, Cate and I are in this together and I've only been thinking about myself. 
My career, my stupid book, my finances. 
I feel as if I�ve let her down and that's not what a husband does. 
Don�t be so hard on yourself, Paul. 
You and I are terrific husbands. Hey, wanna get drunk? 
Come on, you and me and Carla. 
 Who? 
�Jugs� in reception. 
But you gotta ask her. 
Okay, stop it! What are you laughing 
at �Mr. Mom Still Cuts My Hair?� 
And you, �Nose Job Over The Summer.� 
And don't even get me started, �Girl Who Farted During Crunches In Gym Class.� 
Get out of here, good bye! 
I'm so embarrassed. 
I�m never gonna get the hang of these heels... or popularity. 
Oh, come on� stop it. 
Here, just take my shoes. 
They're too big. 
 Thanks. Just take 'em, seriously. 
Shuffling is sexier than falling. 
Bridge, why are you being nice to me? 
I don�t know. 'Cause 
you're my sister and� � you're the only sister I'll ever have. 
God, how many times has Mom said that to us? 
Mom. 
Well, Mom�s gonna need a new catchphrase. We may have a baby sister. 
Yeah, maybe you guys can share shoes. 
This is really big for her. 
I know. And all we've been doing 
is thinking about ourselves. 
We were really mean. 
 God, how could we be so selfish? 
I blame Mom. 
Mom. 
Yoo hoo� Cate. 
Mary Ellen... you're here� 
� volunteering on my day. 
Oh, pish tosh. Now, I know you�re a 
little stressed about this baby thing. 
A little? I don't know if 
I can be a mother again. 
I've been so upset with my family I haven't even had time to think about what I want. I just got my career back. 
Paul is not in the best place and� but, you know, I miss them when they're little. I don't know. 
Hey, Cate, the lab called and your pee's on deck. 
Oh God. - I never thought that 
I could handle more than one... 
Mary Ellen, I really... 
 And then, before we knew it we had five when we adopted Mary Maureen. 
And I have to tell you I love them all, and I wanna say to you that somehow it works out. 
I didn't know little Mary Maureen was adopted. 
Yes. They're all adopted. 
Fred. Insanity in the family. 
Yeah, you know, I really do... 
Cate� what I�m trying to say is, no matter what happens, it�s all going to be okey dokey. 
Well, I've bothered you enough. 
Mary Ellen? 
Would you wait with me? 
Sure. 
Are you finished with my cake pan? 
Alright, everybody, family meeting. 
On the couch. Right now. 
Now, listen to me. Your mother is the 
most wonderful woman on the planet. 
She kills herself for this family. 
She is the salt of the earth. 
Salt. 
And all of us �and all of us have been horrible to her these past twenty four hours. 
Yeah, we know, Dad. - I know. 
 You're right. Dad. 
So, I was thinking� I�m right? You 
never say I'm right. So anyway 
I got her these presents. 
Bridge, you're the chocolates. 
And you're the Teddy Bear. 
You're the pencil with the fuzzy eraser. 
What? - Dad, you must have 
gathered all the change from under the car seats for this stuff. 
Don't worry about it, I'm giving her the big one. 
It's a giraffe. 
 Don't name it!

I bought all the presents, the kids didn't even chip in.

Come here. I just want you to know� 
that I love you and I am so sorry for the way I was behaving and� I want you to know that I really, really want this child. 
And look at this. I even
