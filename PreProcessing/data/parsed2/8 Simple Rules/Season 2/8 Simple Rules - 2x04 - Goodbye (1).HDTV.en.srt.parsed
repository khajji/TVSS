I am so glad I don't dress to be popular anymore. I am so over that stupid 
high school stuff. And by the way, 
that shirt, very five minutes ago. 
Well, if anyone knows what�s very five minutes ago, it's you. 
Please, the only reason you're popular is because I went out with Kyle, which made him popular. And then I 
dumped him and you got him on the rebound which made you popular. Then I had a 
deep relationship with Donny Doyle... 
probably the most meaningful two weeks of my entire life totally taking me out of the loop, creating a popularity vacuum and voila. 
What's that supposed to mean? - I'm not 
sure. It's French. But magicians do it, too. 
Bridget, I am not popular just because you let me be! 
Oh, God, I've seen this delusion building for weeks. 
I'm sorry. I was just walking down the 
hall and thought I heard a chick fight. 
Leave! - Get lost! - Okay. 
I guess now isn't a good time to tell you who's on �high school scandal dot com's� new hot list. - Ranking 
girls by how hot they are is insulting, demeaning and mean spirited. - Yeah, 
yeah, yeah� am I back on the list? 
No. Kerry, on the other 
hand, is number seven. 
Already? Oh my God, 
oh my God, oh my God! 
That makes you happy? 
 No. That makes me hot! 
Who the hell's number six? - Hurry 
up, kids. You'll be late for school! 
I made waffles. 
I thought you made waffles. 
 Well, if I told you it was cereal, you'd still be upstairs goofing off. 
Your Dad will be home with the milk in a minute. 
I�ll get it. Come on, girls. Let�s go. 
Hello? Yeah, this is Mrs. Hennessy. 
God, you are so jealous. - Please� I 
debuted at number two on the Hot List. 
Yeah, but she didn't have to do the things you did to get on it. - Rory! 
Mom! 
Mom? 
My� my keys! Where are my keys! - Mom? 
Oh my god! - Mom? Mom? 
No, I� Well, if the monsignor wants to speak, that�s fine, but, listen... 
no, just, could you please just do what it is that�s done, okay? 
Please? 
Thank you. 
Rory! - There's no milk. 
Where's your sister? 
 She won't come down. 
Okay, I should go talk to her. I�m gonna� 
Rory, will you please not keep your shoes on the stairs. 
Those are Dad's. 
Okay. 
That�s gonna be your grandma. 
 I'll get it. 
Honey, go put a pot of coffee on, okay? 
Go on. - Honey! Honey! 
Mom! - Sweetie. My sweetie. 
I know. I know. 
My baby girl. Baby. 
Honey. - Dad. 
Catie... Catie, I'm 
so sorry, sweetheart. 
He was such a good man, a good husband, a good father. 
He was. He was. 
So, Daddy, did you, did you guys, come on the same flight together? 
Yep. - Well, I would have thought... 
Honey, we're your parents first. - And 
bitterly divorced couple, second. - Dad. 
We are not divorced. 
We're separated. 
All I know is I'm washing my own clothes and making my own bed once a week. 
You know your sister would have come if she could. 
I know. She called from Nepal. 
Nepal. Your sister. 
Honey, Kerry, go get Bridget. 
She should be around her family right now. 
So, I, can I get you something Dad? 
I just made a pot of coffee. You want� 
 I'd love some. Yeah.  Okay. 
Cate, Cate, let me get it. 
Come on, now. Come on. 
You sit down. Can I get you something? 
Yeah. Yesterday would be nice. 
Bridge? - What? 
Gramm and Gramps are here. 
 Is Dad with them? 
No. - Then I really don't give a damn. 
He was supposed to be back in ten minutes. 
He was running a stupid errand. 
He was supposed to be back. 
And he was taking us to school. 
Remember when we were little. 
Mom and Dad used to go out and we wouldn't want them to, and they�d say, 'What do you know about Mommies and Daddies? 
And we would say, They always come back. 
Unless they collapse in aisle three of the stupid grocery store. 
Yeah. 
I just� I just can't believe this. 
Have you spoken with anyone from the church? 
Yeah, Mom. Father 
Fitzpatrick stopped by. 
You know, I've always taken great comfort from the church. 
Yes, I know. But right now, God and 
I aren't exactly on speaking terms. 
Well, he'll be there for you when you're ready. 
Do you have any of those blue and pink packets they use now instead of sugar? 
Sure� yes. You know, I do, 
Dad. Go. Rory, go get him� 
Can't you just use the regular sugar? - No. 
Blood sugar's a little high so I�m just cutting down on the sweets. 
You had a chocolate chip cookie on the plane. - I'm not a fanatic about it. 
I'm just cutting down. - 8You see? 
That�s why I tell you to carry the packets when you�re out. 
Ma, could we just not talk about artificial sweeteners right now? 
I�m sorry, dear. - No, I'll just drink 
it plain. Rory... Rory, forget it. 
No, no, no, no, Dad. Rory, go 
ahead and get them. It�s gonna be� 
No, no� I�ll drink it plain. It�s okay. 
 For the love of God, I will get it. 
So, I remember he was looking for his keys, and I was looking for my backpack. 
Then I remembered I left it upstairs, which is really weird because I never do that. 
But, you were downstairs. 
Did he say anything? 
What do you mean? 
 Well, before he left. 
I mean, you were talking to him. 
What were you talking about? 
I don't know. - How 
could you not remember? 
Kerry! Stop! Would you just stop it! 
I'm sorry. I'm just trying 
to figure it all out. 
I'm sorry. God, this is so messed up. 
He was a great man. 
 Yes, he was. 
I really loved him. 
 He loved you too, Fred. 
Fred, there's my mom. I really 
have to go and check on my mom. 
Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - That 
was a beautiful service. 
Nice casket. Mahogany, 
right? �Cause I love mahogany. 
Reminds me of a pub I used to go to� huge mahogany bar. 
Come to think of it, they used to carry me out of there, too. 
Look it, I loved your dad. 
He was a better man than me. 
I know what you're thinking, 'Who isn't? 
And you're right. He was the 
finest person I�d ever met. 
Why the hell couldn�t I open with that? 
No. Not again. - Cate! - What? 
Oh god. - He was a... 
 A great man? 
He was. - Yes. 
You know, Catie, I�ve got this, fantasy dinner for the people I�m gonna dine with my first night in heaven. 
Really? - Yeah. You see, 
my parents are one and two. 
Then there�s, Jesus. But he�s as much a 
political choice as any if you get my drift. 
Then there�s Joe DiMaggio and Mother Theresa, but, you know, since Paul�s passing, Mother Theresa�s getting the boot. 
Fred, thank you. - Yeah. 
Do you believe in heaven? - �God� heaven or 
�sitting here on the couch with you� heaven? 
Wow. That was really sweet� 
coming from you. 
Either way, �God� heaven or �sitting here with you� heaven� Poppa H is here. 
That was sweet, too. 
Kyle, thank you. 
I swear sometimes I can feel him here, too. 
Why'd you move away? 
Well, if he is here I don't want him to go all poltergeist on me later. 
And the streak stops at two. 
Hey, have you eaten anything? 
No. - You? - No. 
Not in the mood for gooky, red and yellow stuff. 
Man, now you got me hungry. 
Hey. You okay? What 
happened to your hand? 
Nothing, I, burned it on a casserole dish. 
Thanks for the hug, Ror. 
To think, three days ago, this would have been considered a chokehold. 
He was just a... just 
a great, great guy. 
And one of those writers whose columns always made me laugh intentionally or unintentionally. 
He was one of the best. 
He had this funny nickname for me. 
Yes, right�. 
Nick 'Not-So-Sharpe. 
No, it wasn�t that. 
Anyway, everyone down at the paper had immense respect for Paul and his work. 
I was hoping to one day move him back to sports, fire Tommy. 
Hey, boss. - Hey, buddy. 
Anyway, we'd like to do a special supplement of some of Paul's best columns, working up to his last. 
Nick, he would have loved that. 
The problem is, we don't have the last column. He worked out of the house. 
So... - Well, it must be here. I�m� 
I will� When you get the chance if you�ll� - Yeah. I� 
if it�s not too much trouble, if you could e-mail us the column. 
When you're ready. I think 
it�d would be a fitting tribute. 
Okay. - Thanks, Cate. - Thanks, Nick. 
Okay. I have four daughters I could 
never in a million years work at home. 
Paul said he didn't know how he did it. 
He just knew why. 
He loved being with his family. 
Thanks for saying that, Nick. 
If you ever need anything. 
 Okay. 
Hey, Bridget. 
I'm so sorry. 
Thanks. - You know, deep down... 
I always really liked you. 
Deep down, I liked you too. 
Wow! Who knew they 
even had a 'deep down? 
Your dad was� so cool. 
You guys were so close. 
I was so jealous. 
You had the best relationship. 
Really? 
Then how come the last thing I said to him was, 'I hate you. 
There. 
I talked to that nice Father Fitzpatrick today. 
Mom, I asked you not to. 
Well, what was I supposed to do? He 
called. He asked how you were doing. 
I said, Not so good. 
That's all. - 'He' called? 
Yeah. 
 Well, actually he was returning my call, but I thought Father Fitzpatrick could explain� - Really? 
An explanation. Great. And 
that�ll just make everything okay. 
Catie. Catie, honey�I 
talked to Paul's boss. 
Great guy. He wanted me to remind you to 
see if you could find Paul�s last column. 
Well, Dad, I'm just not ready to go through his desk. 
Well, let me do it. I just took a computer 
course at the Senior Citizen's Rec. Center. 
I don't wanna toot my own horn� - Jim? 
Can't you see this is not the time? 
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know 
that professional obligations aren't nearly as important as freezing leftover crap. 
Mom. Dad. 
 Well, I will tell you what�s important. 
What�s important is for Cate to heal. 
And with God's good� Here comes the holy-roller. - I am 
sorry that I spend my Sundays in church while you spend yours saltwater fishing. 
Well, that�s not true. 
Sometimes, I play golf. 
Do you guys even hear yourselves? 
 This is unbelievable. 
Jim, we're not helping her at all. 
I know. I'm sorry. 
So, you admit you�re wrong. 
You know, the last time we were in here together, he accused me of hiding his socks. 
No kissing, or sweet talk, no lovemaking. 
'Where'd you hide my socks, Cate? 
That�s a lovely picture. 
You both look so wonderful. 
It's no wonder I have such beautiful grandchildren. 
There�s a lot of Paul in all of them. 
This wasn't supposed to happen, Mom. 
Not now. 
When we were old and grey and living someplace warm someplace where you eat dinner at four-thirty in the afternoon and drive all the way home with your left directional on. 
Not now. Not at forty-six. 
Well, it's all part of God's plan. 
I swear to God. I swear. 
If people don�t stop saying that to me, I'm gonna scream! God's plan? 
What about my plan? 
What about our plans? 
This picture was a promise. 
And now that promise is broken. 
What's God's plan for my kids? For me? 
It's just so unfair. 
 Honey, nobody said life was fair. 
Oh, God, I know that. 
I know that life isn't fair. 
But nobody told me it was gonna be this cruel. 
Mom? - Hi, baby. Hi. 
You okay? - Yeah. 
You? 
You just go get some sleep. 
I can't sleep. 
And Gramps says the toilet downstairs won't stop running. 
So� I'm gonna help him fix it and let him tell me about the time he met Ted Williams in Korea. 
Again. 
That's really nice, honey. - Night. 
If you need any more blankets, mom, they�re in the cupboard. 
You know, honey, I really don't feel right about sleeping in your bed. 
You really should sleep here. 
I can't, Mom. 
I can't even be in this room. 
I don't think I can ever come in this room again. 
On the next �Eight Simple Rules� I can�t imagine going through a day like this without you kids. 
Maybe if Dad had looked in the drawer and saw all the batteries, he wouldn�t have gone to the store. - Kerry! 
Don�t drive yourself crazy going over and over everything. 
The last words I said to Dad was, �I hate you. 
He wouldn�t let me borrow the stupid car and I said, �I hate you. 
I�m kinda mad at him, Gramps. 
Yeah, I know. I know, Rory. It�s okay. 
It�s a whole lot to try to make sense of.
