Okay, your sister's gone. 
The kids are all upstairs. 
So the pregnancy test is yours? 
Yeah. I took the test and 
it was negative and then... 
You got me so excited there thinking I was going to be a father again. 
Well, then, my body still didn�t feel right, so I rearranged the furniture. 
Oh, yeah. It looks nice. I 
like this flow you got here. 
No, no�Paul, you don�t understand. 
I took it again and it was positive. 
What? How could this happen? 
How could this happen? Well, 
you see, Paul, you know, a man and a woman fall in love and at some point... 
I know how it happens. 
Hey, honey, listen� if your body's going through weird things, maybe it�s just that you're going through men� �men� many different things, my child. 
Cate, look, it�s just that, you know, I'm trying to write my book and the column isn't catching fire. 
And it's just really a bad time right now for me to have a baby. 
Oh, well� how �bout if I carried it for you? 
This is the worst thing in the whole world! 
Bridget, you shouldn't be eavesdropping! 
So your mother may be pregnant... 
There it is. 'High School 
Scandal Dot Com. 
'Bridget Hennessy is so five minutes ago.' Oh my god! 
Bridget, you don�t read this stupid stuff. 
Oh my gosh, and it says, 'Look at her sister? She's so right now.' 
It does? Oh my god, this is so... 
Wait a minute. Mom, you're pregnant? 
Mom, you're pregnant?

You know, when you're pregnant your breasts get bigger. 
Kyle, what are you doing here? 
 I came by to see Kerry. 
First Bridget, now Kerry. 
Kyle, what are your intentions with my daughters? 
I can't tell you that. 
You're the father.

Cake�s on the porch! - Thank you. 
 Look, may I say something? 
You might try saying 'no' once in a blue moon, missy. 
Alright, look� I am gonna get a definitive test at the hospital tomorrow. 
Kerry, are those my earrings? 
What are you talking about? 
 They are my earrings! 
Okay, first you steal my popularity and then my earrings! 
You forgot about your boyfriend.

That�s enough. Get up! Get up! 
Get up! Get up on the couch. 
And you stop it! Stop it! 
 You broke my earrings! 
Stop fighting or I'm going to turn this car right around! 
Paul, we're in the living room. - It's 
a saying. - It's a saying in a car. 
Hemingway said it all the time. 
 No, he didn't. 
I thought we agreed not to make me look stupid in front of the kids? 
This is a madhouse. I'm supposed 
to bring a baby into this madhouse? 
Good morning. 
I said, �Good morning.� What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? 
I say, �I may be pregnant.� and 
you say, 'How could this happen?' 
But I just lost my baby weight from the last one. 
Honey, I know exactly what happened. 
It went a little something like this� You gotta get a new voice. 
What are you doing? - I'm surprising 
Mom with breakfast in bed. 
And I made her a card... 
 And I made her a card. 
You are such a girl. 
Our little sister Rory. 
Hey, she seemed pretty ticked off last night. I'm just saving my butt. 
No! Hey! Hey! No! 
Surprise! 
Bridget would you please pass the milk. 
 You don't deserve milk. 
You could've knocked! 
 It's seven in the morning! 
I thought you couldn't do anything until you had your first cup of coffee? 
Yeah. I mean, there's 
already one baby. 
What were you trying to do, make twins? 
Yeah� that's how it happens. 
Alright, you guys, knock it off. 
Now look, I am sorry that you walked in on us. 
But you are just gonna have to accept the fact that your father and I are sexual beings! 
Come on, kids� knock it off. 
Don�t you see your mother�s going through a pregnancy scare? 
Oh, so now it's a scare? Which 
apparently I'm going through alone. 
Now, you guys are amazing. You are 
totally self centered. Unbelievable. 
Good bye! 
Looks like we won�t be walking in on you two any time soon. 
Bridget. 
Hey, Bridget. 
It�s, um� it's not what it looks like. 
There's just a lot of societal pressure on me to be all over your sister. 
Well, I don�t have any time to convo, I have to call my older boyfriend who�s in college. 
Hi, is Midshipman Donny Doyle there? Donny! 
Hey, Bridget. 
Donny, you miss me, don�t you? 
Of course I do. I can't 
get my mind off you. 
In fact, I was thinking about you so much during chess club, I opened up with a Polish Gambit Accepted, when I should've opened up with a Polish Gambit Denied. I mean� 'Duh.' 
Chess club? Donny, you're cool 
at Naval college, aren't you? 
Are you kidding? I'm way cool. 
Hey! Doyle's got a girlfriend! 
Shut up! You got a girlfriend! 
Bridget, I gotta go. 
The new kid. 
The new kid. 
 The new kid. 
Pudding. 
This pudding sucks. 
This pudding sucks! 
Hey. 
There�s something you should know: I have a boyfriend already, he's in Navy College, and he can do the Polish Gambit. 
I was gonna say, 'Pass the salt.' 
Pudding. Mmm. 
Sometimes� all you need is a little spice. 
That's deep. 
 No. 
No, it's wide. If I went 
deep, you couldn't find me. 
What does that mean? 
I don't know. 
I'm Bridget. 
 Damian. 
There's something you should know, I'm kind of an outcast right now. 
I�m thinking about buying a motorcycle. 
Hennessy! 
Just the man I wanna see. 
How would you like to turn... 
Tommy, I'm having a bad day. 
 Poor me. You're having a bad day. 
I'm on sexual harassment probation thanks to what�s her name� 'Boobs' in reception. 
Listen� how would you like to turn five hundred bucks into three thousand dollars by Monday morning? 
Tom. - It�s guaranteed. 
 Tommy, no. 
What's wrong, pal? 
 Oh, hey, Paul.  Fred? 
Hey, the receptionist with the big front porch sent me up. 
Hey, you look like a smart fella. How�d you like to turn 
Tommy! - Okay. 
 Sit down, Fred.  Oh, thank you. 
Is there any special reason you�re dropping by? 
Well, I kinda read between the lines last night, when you slammed the door in our faces. 
I�m so sorry, Fred, I... 
 No problem. 
Yeah, I kinda sensed your stress, well what with you and Cate and your impending fatherhood potentiality. 
Well, nothing�s, nothing's for sure. 
Yeah, I know. Well, I 
picked up on that too. 
Fred, I don�t really need... 
 You see, me and Mary Ellen, well, we can't have kids of our own. 
I had no idea. All 
your kids are adopted? 
Yeah. Yeah. We� 
�we think Donny's a Kennedy. 
I just came down to tell you that I think you're a good father. 
Yeah, I've seen you. 
And besides, you're not in this alone, you know. 
You and, you and Cate are in it together. 
Two peas in a pod, as it were. 
Listen, I better shove off, boy and oh, yeah� if you�re finished with the cake, Mary Ellen would like her pan back. 
Oh my god, Cate and I are in this together and I've only been thinking about myself. 
My career, my stupid book, my finances. 
I feel as if I�ve let her down and that's not what a husband does. 
Don�t be so hard on yourself, Paul. 
You and I are terrific husbands. Hey, wanna get drunk? 
Come on, you and me and Carla. 
 Who? 
�Jugs� in reception. 
But you gotta ask her. 
Okay, stop it! What are you laughing 
at �Mr. Mom Still Cuts My Hair?� 
And you, �Nose Job Over The Summer.� 
And don't even get me started, �Girl Who Farted During Crunches In Gym Class.� 
Get out of here, good bye! 
I'm so embarrassed. 
I�m never gonna get the hang of these heels... or popularity. 
Oh, come on� stop it. 
Here, just take my shoes. 
They're too big. 
 Thanks. Just take 'em, seriously. 
Shuffling is sexier than falling. 
Bridge, why are you being nice to me? 
I don�t know. 'Cause 
you're my sister and� � you're the only sister I'll ever have. 
God, how many times has Mom said that to us? 
Mom. 
Well, Mom�s gonna need a new catchphrase. We may have a baby sister. 
Yeah, maybe you guys can share shoes. 
This is really big for her. 
I know. And all we've been doing 
is thinking about ourselves. 
We were really mean. 
 God, how could we be so selfish? 
I blame Mom. 
Mom. 
Yoo hoo� Cate. 
Mary Ellen... you're here� 
� volunteering on my day. 
Oh, pish tosh. Now, I know you�re a 
little stressed about this baby thing. 
A little? I don't know if 
I can be a mother again. 
I've been so upset with my family I haven't even had time to think about what I want. I just got my career back. 
Paul is not in the best place and� but, you know, I miss them when they're little. I don't know. 
Hey, Cate, the lab called and your pee's on deck. 
Oh God. - I never thought that 
I could handle more than one... 
Mary Ellen, I really... 
 And then, before we knew it we had five when we adopted Mary Maureen. 
And I have to tell you I love them all, and I wanna say to you that somehow it works out. 
I didn't know little Mary Maureen was adopted. 
Yes. They're all adopted. 
Fred. Insanity in the family. 
Yeah, you know, I really do... 
Cate� what I�m trying to say is, no matter what happens, it�s all going to be okey dokey. 
Well, I've bothered you enough. 
Mary Ellen? 
Would you wait with me? 
Sure. 
Are you finished with my cake pan? 
Alright, everybody, family meeting. 
On the couch. Right now. 
Now, listen to me. Your mother is the 
most wonderful woman on the planet. 
She kills herself for this family. 
She is the salt of the earth. 
Salt. 
And all of us �and all of us have been horrible to her these past twenty four hours. 
Yeah, we know, Dad. - I know. 
 You're right. Dad. 
So, I was thinking� I�m right? You 
never say I'm right. So anyway 
I got her these presents. 
Bridge, you're the chocolates. 
And you're the Teddy Bear. 
You're the pencil with the fuzzy eraser. 
What? - Dad, you must have 
gathered all the change from under the car seats for this stuff. 
Don't worry about it, I'm giving her the big one. 
It's a giraffe. 
 Don't name it! 
A giraffe! 
Hi, guys. 
Mom. - Mom... 
 We are so sorry. 
Oh, hi� hi, honies. - Mom, we really 
want you to have this baby. 
Yeah, so long as it's not a boy. 
 That's very generous of you, but And we'll do everything we can to help. 
We'll baby sit it. 
We�ll change it. 
 Change it� hello! French manicure, 
I ain�t changing it. You gotta� 
 Why do I always have to do everything? 
Now, girls - I�m not changing  Girls.  Mom. 
I felt bad about this morning, so I wrote you a song. 
Unplanned baby. 
Welcome to the family. 
Rory, Rory. Honey, that�s 
so sweet. Thank you. 
Thanks to all my kids. 
I bought all the presents, the kids didn't even chip in. 
I�m kidding, Cate. Come here. 
Come here. I just want you to know� 
that I love you and I am so sorry for the way I was behaving and� I want you to know that I really, really want this child. 
And look at this. I even 
got the baby�s first gift. 
That�s so nice. Thank you. 
Thanks everybody. 
But, I'm not pregnant. 
No? - No? 
No? 
 No... 
Shut up. 
 Why are you hitting me for? 
Take it upstairs! Kids! 
Right now, go upstairs. 
Right now! Take it upstairs! 
Nice giraffe. 
Yeah, you know, giraffes are gender neutral. 
So it doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl. 
So... not pregnant? 
Nope. 
 How do you feel? 
I don�t know. 
You little twerp, you like totally scuffed my shoes! 
Tell you why! - Yeah, but you 
broke mine, you big foot! 
Let go of me! 
 Get off of me! 
Stop it. 
 So, not pregnant! 
I gave my love a cherry, that had no stone. 
I gave my love a chicken, that had no... 
Sorry. 
I am so glad I don't dress to be popular anymore. I am so over that stupid 
high school stuff. And by the way, 
that shirt, very five minutes ago. 
Well, if anyone knows what�s very five minutes ago, it's you. 
Please, the only reason you're popular is because I went out with Kyle, which made him popular. And then I 
dumped him and you got him on the rebound which made you popular. Then I had a 
deep relationship with Donny Doyle... 
probably the most meaningful two weeks of my entire life totally taking me out of the loop, creating a popularity vacuum and voila. 
What's that supposed to mean? - I'm not 
sure. It's French. But magicians do it, too. 
Bridget, I am not popular just because you let me be! 
Oh, God, I've seen this delusion building for weeks. 
I'm sorry. I was just walking down the 
hall and thought I heard a chick fight. 
Leave! - Get lost! - Okay. 
I guess now isn't a good time to tell you who's on �high school scandal dot com's� new hot list. - Ranking 
girls by how hot they are is insulting, demeaning and mean spirited. - Yeah, 
yeah, yeah� am I back on the list? 
No. Kerry, on the other 
hand, is number seven. 
Already? Oh my God, 
oh my God, oh my God! 
That makes you happy? 
 No. That makes me hot! 
Who the hell's number six? - Hurry 
up, kids. You'll be late for school! 
I made waffles. 
I thought you made waffles. 
 Well, if I told you it was cereal, you'd still be upstairs goofing off. 
Your Dad will be home with the milk in a minute. 
I�ll get it. Come on, girls. Let�s go. 
Hello? Yeah, this is Mrs. Hennessy. 
God, you are so jealous. - Please� I 
debuted at number two on the Hot List. 
Yeah, but she didn't have to do the things you did to get on it. - Rory! 
Mom! 
Mom? 
My� my keys! Where are my keys! - Mom? 
Oh my god! - Mom? Mom? 
No, I� Well, if the monsignor wants to speak, that�s fine, but, listen... 
no, just, could you please just do what it is that�s done, okay? 
Please? 
Thank you. 
Rory! - There's no milk. 
Where's your sister? 
 She won't come down. 
Okay, I should go talk to her. I�m gonna� 
Rory, will you please not keep your shoes on the stairs. 
Those are Dad's. 
Okay. 
That�s gonna be your grandma. 
 I'll get it. 
Honey, go put a pot of coffee on, okay? 
Go on. - Honey! Honey! 
Mom! - Sweetie. My sweetie. 
I know. I know. 
My baby girl. Baby. 
Honey. - Dad. 
Catie... Catie, I'm 
so sorry, sweetheart. 
He was such a good man, a good husband, a good father. 
He was. He was. 
So, Daddy, did you, did you guys, come on the same flight together? 
Yep. - Well, I would have thought... 
Honey, we're your parents first. - And 
bitterly divorced couple, second. - Dad. 
We are not divorced. 
We're separated. 
All I know is I'm washing my own clothes and making my own bed once a week. 
You know your sister would have come if she could. 
I know. She called from Nepal. 
Nepal. Your sister. 
Honey, Kerry, go get Bridget. 
She should be around her family right now. 
So, I, can I get you something Dad? 
I just made a pot of coffee. You want� 
 I'd love some. Yeah.  Okay. 
Cate, Cate, let me get it. 
Come on, now. Come on. 
You sit down. Can I get you something? 
Yeah. Yesterday would be nice. 
Bridge? - What? 
Gramm and Gramps are here. 
 Is Dad with them? 
No. - Then I really don't give a damn. 
He was supposed to be back in ten minutes. 
He was running a stupid errand. 
He was supposed to be back. 
And he was taking us to school. 
Remember when we were little. 
Mom and Dad used to go out and we wouldn't want them to, and they�d say, 'What do you know about Mommies and Daddies? 
And we would say, They always come back. 
Unless they collapse in aisle three of the stupid grocery store. 
Yeah. 
I just� I just can't believe this. 
Have you spoken with anyone from the church? 
Yeah, Mom. Father 
Fitzpatrick stopped by. 
You know, I've always taken great comfort from the church. 
Yes, I know. But right now, God and 
I aren't exactly on speaking terms. 
Well, he'll be there for you when you're ready. 
Do you have any of those blue and pink packets they use now instead of sugar? 
Sure� yes. You know, I do, 
Dad. Go. Rory, go get him� 
Can't you just use the regular sugar? - No. 
Blood sugar's a little high so I�m just cutting down on the sweets. 
You had a chocolate chip cookie on the plane. - I'm not a fanatic about it. 
I'm just cutting down. - 8You see? 
That�s why I tell you to carry the packets when you�re out. 
Ma, could we just not talk about artificial sweeteners right now? 
I�m sorry, dear. - No, I'll just drink 
it plain. Rory... Rory, forget it. 
No, no, no, no, Dad. Rory, go 
ahead and get them. It�s gonna be� 
No, no� I�ll drink it plain. It�s okay. 
 For the love of God, I will get it. 
So, I remember he was looking for his keys, and I was looking for my backpack. 
Then I remembered I left it upstairs, which is really weird because I never do that. 
But, you were downstairs. 
Did he say anything? 
What do you mean? 
 Well, before he left. 
I mean, you were talking to him. 
What were you talking about? 
I don't know. - How 
could you not remember? 
Kerry! Stop! Would you just stop it! 
I'm sorry. I'm just trying 
to figure it all out. 
I'm sorry. God, this is so messed up. 
He was a great man. 
 Yes, he was. 
I really loved him. 
 He loved you too, Fred. 
Fred, there's my mom. I really 
have to go and check on my mom. 
Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - That 
was a beautiful service. 
Nice casket. Mahogany, 
right? �Cause I love mahogany. 
Reminds me of a pub I used to go to� huge mahogany bar. 
Come to think of it, they used to carry me out of there, too. 
Look it, I loved your dad. 
He was a better man than me. 
I know what you're thinking, 'Who isn't? 
And you're right. He was the 
finest person I�d ever met. 
Why the hell couldn�t I open with that? 
No. Not again. - Cate! - What? 
Oh god. - He was a... 
 A great man? 
He was. - Yes. 
You know, Catie, I�ve got this, fantasy dinner for the people I�m gonna dine with my first night in heaven. 
Really? - Yeah. You see, 
my parents are one and two. 
Then there�s, Jesus. But he�s as much a 
political choice as any if you get my drift. 
Then there�s Joe DiMaggio and Mother Theresa, but, you know, since Paul�s passing, Mother Theresa�s getting the boot. 
Fred, thank you. - Yeah. 
Do you believe in heaven? - �God� heaven or 
�sitting here on the couch with you� heaven? 
Wow. That was really sweet� 
coming from you. 
Either way, �God� heaven or �sitting here with you� heaven� Poppa H is here. 
That was sweet, too. 
Kyle, thank you. 
I swear sometimes I can feel him here, too. 
Why'd you move away? 
Well, if he is here I don't want him to go all poltergeist on me later. 
And the streak stops at two. 
Hey, have you eaten anything? 
No. - You? - No. 
Not in the mood for gooky, red and yellow stuff. 
Man, now you got me hungry. 
Hey. You okay? What 
happened to your hand? 
Nothing, I, burned it on a casserole dish. 
Thanks for the hug, Ror. 
To think, three days ago, this would have been considered a chokehold. 
He was just a... just 
a great, great guy. 
And one of those writers whose columns always made me laugh intentionally or unintentionally. 
He was one of the best. 
He had this funny nickname for me. 
Yes, right�. 
Nick 'Not-So-Sharpe. 
No, it wasn�t that. 
Anyway, everyone down at the paper had immense respect for Paul and his work. 
I was hoping to one day move him back to sports, fire Tommy. 
Hey, boss. - Hey, buddy. 
Anyway, we'd like to do a special supplement of some of Paul's best columns, working up to his last. 
Nick, he would have loved that. 
The problem is, we don't have the last column. He worked out of the house. 
So... - Well, it must be here. I�m� 
I will� When you get the chance if you�ll� - Yeah. I� 
if it�s not too much trouble, if you could e-mail us the column. 
When you're ready. I think 
it�d would be a fitting tribute. 
Okay. - Thanks, Cate. - Thanks, Nick. 
Okay. I have four daughters I could 
never in a million years work at home. 
Paul said he didn't know how he did it. 
He just knew why. 
He loved being with his family. 
Thanks for saying that, Nick. 
If you ever need anything. 
 Okay. 
Hey, Bridget. 
I'm so sorry. 
Thanks. - You know, deep down... 
I always really liked you. 
Deep down, I liked you too. 
Wow! Who knew they 
even had a 'deep down? 
Your dad was� so cool. 
You guys were so close. 
I was so jealous. 
You had the best relationship. 
Really? 
Then how come the last thing I said to him was, 'I hate you. 
There. 
I talked to that nice Father Fitzpatrick today. 
Mom, I asked you not to. 
Well, what was I supposed to do? He 
called. He asked how you were doing. 
I said, Not so good. 
That's all. - 'He' called? 
Yeah. 
 Well, actually he was returning my call, but I thought Father Fitzpatrick could explain� - Really? 
An explanation. Great. And 
that�ll just make everything okay. 
Catie. Catie, honey�I 
talked to Paul's boss. 
Great guy. He wanted me to remind you to 
see if you could find Paul�s last column. 
Well, Dad, I'm just not ready to go through his desk. 
Well, let me do it. I just took a computer 
course at the Senior Citizen's Rec. Center. 
I don't wanna toot my own horn� - Jim? 
Can't you see this is not the time? 
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know 
that professional obligations aren't nearly as important as freezing leftover crap. 
Mom. Dad. 
 Well, I will tell you what�s important. 
What�s important is for Cate to heal. 
And with God's good� Here comes the holy-roller. - I am 
sorry that I spend my Sundays in church while you spend yours saltwater fishing. 
Well, that�s not true. 
Sometimes, I play golf. 
Do you guys even hear yourselves? 
 This is unbelievable. 
Jim, we're not helping her at all. 
I know. I'm sorry. 
So, you admit you�re wrong. 
You know, the last time we were in here together, he accused me of hiding his socks. 
No kissing, or sweet talk, no lovemaking. 
'Where'd you hide my socks, Cate? 
That�s a lovely picture. 
You both look so wonderful. 
It's no wonder I have such beautiful grandchildren. 
There�s a lot of Paul in all of them. 
This wasn't supposed to happen, Mom. 
Not now. 
When we were old and grey and living someplace warm someplace where you eat dinner at four-thirty in the afternoon and drive all the way home with your left directional on. 
Not now. Not at forty-six. 
Well, it's all part of God's plan. 
I swear to God. I swear. 
If people don�t stop saying that to me, I'm gonna scream! God's plan? 
What about my plan? 
What about our plans? 
This picture was a promise. 
And now that promise is broken. 
What's God's plan for my kids? For me? 
It's just so unfair. 
 Honey, nobody said life was fair. 
Oh, God, I know that. 
I know that life isn't fair. 
But nobody told me it was gonna be this cruel. 
Mom? - Hi, baby. Hi. 
You okay? - Yeah. 
You? 
You just go get some sleep. 
I can't sleep. 
And Gramps says the toilet downstairs won't stop running. 
So� I'm gonna help him fix it and let him tell me about the time he met Ted Williams in Korea. 
Again. 
That's really nice, honey. - Night. 
If you need any more blankets, mom, they�re in the cupboard. 
You know, honey, I really don't feel right about sleeping in your bed. 
You really should sleep here. 
I can't, Mom. 
I can't even be in this room. 
I don't think I can ever come in this room again. 
On the next �Eight Simple Rules� I can�t imagine going through a day like this without you kids. 
Maybe if Dad had looked in the drawer and saw all the batteries, he wouldn�t have gone to the store. - Kerry! 
Don�t drive yourself crazy going over and over everything. 
The last words I said to Dad was, �I hate you. 
He wouldn�t let me borrow the stupid car and I said, �I hate you. 
I�m kinda mad at him, Gramps. 
Yeah, I know. I know, Rory. It�s okay. 
It�s a whole lot to try to make sense of. 
Fred and Mary Ellen Doyle. 
Just wanted to see if we could pop by for a few� Hey, neighbor, Fred Doyle here� Hey, neighbor� You know, you could return one of Fred s calls. 
Okay, I can't talk to you when you're like this. 
The man, he can't take a hint. 
He would still keep calling here if we changed our outgoing message to Doyle, you idiot, stop calling! 
Hey, neighbor. 
Well� hello. Fred, Mary Ellen� 
we were just talking about you. 
You lie! - Yes, we were. We used your names 
and everything. Rory, say hi to the Doyles. 
Sorry to burst in like this. We tried calling but 
something must be wrong with your answering machine. - Yes, well... 
you know, we haven t been able to receive any incoming messages at all. 
Something s wrong with the answering machine? - Rory! No! No! 
Hey, neighbor, Fred Doyle and Mary Ellen Doyle� - You fixed it! 
It wasn t broke. 
 I said you fixed it. 
So, what can we do for you? 
 We made Donny a video postcard. 
He gets so lonely down at the Naval Academy. 
Yeah, nothing fancy, mind you, just the whole family got together to say hi and singing a few tunes from Sound of Music. 
So different. - That's, gee� yeah. 
Yeah, anyway� we left a little room at the end of the tape so that Donny s best girl, Bridget, could say Howdy do. 
Now you tell Bridget she's under no pressure to sing and dance on the tape. 
Donny understands that'she's not a Doyle. 
Yet. 
She can do those things, right? - Yes. 
You sure? - Okay then, well, listen, thank 
you so much for stopping by, you guys. 
We'll see you later, alright? Okay. Bye-bye. 
Wait a minute� what am I thinking here. 
On a more somber note, there is a crime wave presently in our neighborhood. 
No. Burglaries? - Eggings. 
Yeah. Yeah� the Feeneys, the O Tooles, 
the Johnsons have all taken the yolk. 
And this guy keeps changing his M.O. shaving cream, toilet paper. 
No, where will this madman stop? - Yeah. 
Exactly, so as Captain of the Neighborhood Watch, I wanted to ask you, Paul� Fred, listen you know that I would love to join the Watch and go on patrol with you guys Paulie, Paulie, Paulie, look� you're far too valuable behind a typewriter. 
See, what this malcontent needs is a, is a nickname. 
Something we can put in the local paper to raise awareness. 
Coming up with a name should be a snap for you. 
You mean, something like The Michigan Mischief Maker? 
Boy, you writers are amazing. 
 It's nothing. 
Boy, to come up with just the right turn of phrase you must have to wade through a million stinkers like that? 
You got grit. He's got grit, 
Mary. He's the grittiest. 
Hey, Bridge, can I borrow your go-go boots to go with this skirt for that'sixties party everyone s going to? 
What'sixties party? 
Just some lame party, I'm totally gonna blow it off... in your boots. 
Alright, Kerry, listen� you don't have to protect my feelings. 
When I was the popular one, I went to millions of really cool parties, I never even told you about� because they were really lame. 
Hello. Damian. Shut up. 
I hate you. Okay, see you then. 
Damian? - Yes, that really hot new 
senior with the homemade tattoos. 
We had this secret date, and oh my God, he's such a good kisser. 
Except when his tongue ring caught one of my fillings. 
Bridget, what about Donny Doyle? 
Thank you for making me think of Donny. Now, I feel guilty. 
Well, you should feel guilty. 
He's your boyfriend and when he finds out you're two-timing him, you're gonna wind up alone. 
He's in Maryland. How s he 
ever going to find that out? 
Damian, I told you I d meet� It's Donny? 
You have reached Bridget s voice mail. 
Please leave a message. Beep! 
Bridge, he's not gonna fall for�  He's leaving a message. 
That was so close. What if 
I'm not always that clever? 
It is a high level to maintain. 
 You re right. 
I am so gonna get caught. You know, I 
have to choose between one or the other. 
One or the other what? 
 Yeah, Bridge, what? 
You know, Kerry, if you wanna borrow my boots, they re upstairs in the box marked, shut up. - Got it. 
What was that about? - Dad, did 
you ever have to choose between... 
two things that you really, really liked? - Indeed I did. 
As a young man about to embark on life's journey, I was faced with a dilemma� Hi, how �bout Cliff Notes? 
Okay, well, when I graduated college I had to make a decision whether or not I was gonna go to law school, as I always planned, or become a writer. 
Which did you choose? 
Anyway, Bridge, what I'm trying to say is: follow your heart. 
I followed my heart and I ve never looked back. 
That's your advice, follow my heart? 
 Well, it's not that'simple. 
I can't believe I never thought of that! 
I'mean, I'm always, like, so logical. 
Bridget, hey, Bridget. The 
Doyles brought this over for you. 
They made Donny a video letter and they left some room at the end for a message from his special girl. 
You. - Right. Yeah. 
So, Paul, I always thought that you never got into Law School. 
She asked for the Cliff Notes. 
Anyway, Donny, it, looks like Grandma's not gonna make it past Thanksgiving. 
But, on the upside, you re moving on up to the adult table. 
Alright now, a very special message to Donny from Donny s little sweetheart, Bridget Hennessy. 
Perhaps The future Mrs. Donny Doyle? 
Did I say that? 
You re a bomb. Okay, hit 
the �off button, honey. 
Mary Maureen... 
For the love of Mike. 
Hey. How's Navy College? Not much going on 
here, except I got these new sandals with this really cute flower pattern, but the first time I wore �em the strap totally broke off. And when I brought 
em back for a refund, they'd only give me a store credit. I was all, Yeah, 
like I wanna buy more of your defects. 
And I think we should see other people. And 
I totally understand if you wanna tell all your Navy friends that you broke up with me. Good luck at war and stuff. Bye. 
Dude, I'm sorry. So, can I call her? 
Hey, Cate, listen to this. I came up 
with a couple names for this prankster. 
Which do you like better The Lone Eggman or The Neighbor-hoodlum? 
Why don't you try something like The Oakdale Vandal? 
The Oakdale Vandal? Who's gonna 
crack the case, the Hardy Boys? 
You know, you're right, Paul. 
The Lone Eggman is gold. 
Fine, I'll just trust my own instincts. 
Rory, what do you think? 
I'm not going anywhere. 
 No, which do you like better The Neighbor-hoodlum or The Lone Eggman? 
Dad, both really capture the guy. 
 I know. 
But what about something like: The Injustice Fighter or The Righteous Avenger or: Operation: You Tenth Graders Picked On The Wrong Guy? 
That's too many words for a headline. 
I'll get it. 
Hey, what's wrong? - Donny. 
Well, come in. What is it? 
Something's happened at school. Donny� 
Donny� Donny got a B. 
Here come the waterworks. 
Wait a minute, wait� you, you, you re this upset over a B? 
We don't expect you to understand. 
We still care about our kids grades. 
Hey! You know, we still 
care about our� - I never should have sent him that blasted videotape letter! 
Fred thinks something on it upset him. 
He got the tape, he fell apart. 
Mary Ellen, it's time to come clean. 
When we sang Climb Every Mountain... I sang Donny's part. 
It was like I was rubbing his nose in it: You re gone, I'm the big baritone around here, now, pal. 
I'm nothing but a no-good harmony part stealer. 
Fred, I'm sure stealing a harmony part isn't the problem. 
What else could it be? - Well, Bridget 
broke up with him on that videotape. 
No, I thought everyone knew. 
Your daughter� broke up with our Donny? 
On our videotape? - You 
took Donny s harmony part? 
Well, see this? Little Bridgie 
s behind Donny s downfall. 
She enchanted him with her feminine wiles, and flaunted all her what's-its and who-zits. 
Wait just a minute here! 
 Now, now, now� Fred, wait. 
It's no one s fault. In fact, there may 
be a silver lining to this whole mess. 
Exactly. Maybe now Donny can 
focus on his studies again. 
Yes. Or maybe, Cate, you'll start 
spending a little more time at home before Kerry turns into a boy-destroying hussy like her sister. 
That's too late. 
Who are you calling a hussy? 
There is nothing wrong with the� I can't defend that. 
What, I told you that I'm going to that'sixties party. Don't you ever listen? 
Bold move there, Paul letting a ten year old dabble in the summer of love. 
I'm not ten! - Alright, Kerry. 
Go upstairs. I'll handle this. 
Look here, I am sorry about Donny and Bridget. 
But that does not mean you can insult my family. 
So, I am going to have to ask you to leave this house. 
Well� we re going. 
But you will rue this day, Hennessy, mark my words. 
The eyes of the Neighborhood Watch no longer will land upon your house! 
No! How will we ever 
survive without pudgy middle-aged men with walkie-talkies to protect us? 
It's too bad Donny and Bridget couldn't work it out. - Yeah. 
The Doyles will probably never talk to us again. - I know. 
I feel like I should buy Bridget something. 
What was that? - What? 
That. It's him. He's here! Who? 
The Motown Disturber. Really? 
I thought that's a keeper. 
What should we do? 
 I'll take care of it. 
A toilet brush? Are you 
going to scrub him to death? 
Would you want to be touched with this? 
Stop! 
 You had enough? Had enough, punk? 
Please, Mr. Hennessy. Mr. Hennessy, 
I give. What, wait� 
Donny? Donny, what are you doing here? 
Look, I had to see Bridget. 
I need to see her. 
I'm desperate� oh, my God, Mr. Hennessy, 
you beat me with a toilet brush? 
Would you stick to the subject? 
What happened to you? 
I hitchhiked all the way here. But to 
see Bridget again, I was happy to ride in the back of that truck with all those pigs. 
Did that come from the master bath or the girls bathroom? 
What does that matter? 
 You re right. 
All that matters is seeing Bridget and winning her back. 
She's the whole reason I went AWOL. 
 AWOL? 
Donny, you re in the military. 
This isn't just cutting class. 
It's desertion. They, 
they shoot people for that! 
I don't care. I d gladly face a 
thousand firing squads for Bridget. 
I'm gonna have to call your parents. 
 No, don't do that. They'll kill me. 
No, wait. Come on now, 
listen� You got pig smell. 
I'm serious, Donny. You 
have to get back to your dorm before anyone notices you ve gone �A �W �O �L. 
Sir, I know I can make Bridget love me. 
Then again, a long stretch in the brig might do you some good. 
Cate, he s not listening! Forget 
it, I'll wait until you're off the phone with the Doyles. 
 Yeah, well they won t even notice. 
They're on another crying jag. 
I told �em about the pig truck. 
Where do kids get this idea that they're meant to be together? 
Paul, he's young and hopelessly in love. 
Don't you remember what that was like? - No! Do you? - No. 
But, but you pretend. - Right. 
Okay� Donny, you and Bridget are obviously meant to be together. 
But if you obsess about her, and, you know, break into her home, she could take it the wrong way. 
You know, women, how they are. 
So you re saying, if she sees me here, she might think I'm a little pathetic and needy? 
No, I'm saying that'she, along with most courts, will think you're a stalker. 
I gotta get back to Annapolis. 
You know, that toilet brush whoopin might be the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
Thanks, Mr. Hennessy. - You betcha. - Donny, 
your parents will be here any minute. 
No. - Paul, you really pummeled him. 
I feel bad. 
Stop gloating. He 
didn't even fight back. 
Not after the ass-whippin I dished out. 
Donny? My god, what are you doing here? 
I am not a stalker� or pathetic or needy. 
You smell like a pig. 
 Yeah, long story. 
Bridget, I thought you were in bed. 
I was studying. 
 Without books? 
Ever hear of the Internet? - The computer's 
here. And you do not have a laptop. 
And whose fault is that? 
 Okay, alright, you two. 
Look, before Bridget ends up with a free laptop, why don't you just show Donny where we keep the antiseptic? 
Alright, where is he? 
 Now, Fred, your blood pressure. 
Our boy s gone AWOL. 
Somebody's in for a spanking! 
Fred! Fred! - What? 
 You wanna cinch that? 
You were in a fight with my Dad? 
Well, it wasn t so much a fight as a�  That is so cool.  battle to the death. 
Well, after Donny and I had our little chat, I'm pretty sure he s going back to the Naval Academy. 
Mom, Dad: I'm dropping out of the Naval Academy. - You're what? 
Bridget changed her mind. She's taking 
me back! - Daddy, look at him. 
He's just so... Edward Norton 
in Fight Club right now. 
Donny, you can't throw everything away for some girl who's not even good enough for you! 
Is it your life s mission to destroy me? 
Robe. 
Bridget's not good enough to date Donny. Yeah, well 
Donny's not good enough to date Bridget! 
Maybe you should have gone to law school. - Dad! 
No, honey� I'm fine. 
What is it, Kerry? - Here we are, 
another morning talking about Bridget. 
Honey, I know that's hard. 
 No, no, she deserves the attention. 
After all she does have two boyfriends right now. 
You guys think I care that nobody noticed I snuck out and stayed out past curfew? 
Back up a second. - Okay, it was 
just a few minutes past curfew. 
Not that. Bridget has two boyfriends? 
God, no one is interested in me. 
Honey, of course we re interested in you. 
What can you tell us about Bridget? 
And what about this other boyfriend? 
 Kerry, wait!  Wait! Kerry! Kerry! 
We are really upset with you. You get 
back here, right now! Who am I kidding. 
This is unbelievable! 
Donny drops out of school to be with Bridget and she's two-timing him. 
Yeah, well we have to talk to her. 
 Damn right, we re gonna talk to her. 
You notice we never have problems like this with the boy? 
Bye, Dad. - See ya, son. 
Yeah? 
Bridget, you re going out with Donny, and you have another boyfriend? 
Yeah. Isn't it funny how 
everything just worked out? 
Do you, do you realize that Donny s giving up his dream of being in the Navy to come here and be with you? 
Meanwhile, tomorrow you could just decide to dump him. 
I can't believe you think I'm that fickle. 
 Well, you did dump him yesterday. 
That is so like you just to dredge up the past. You know, the only 
reason I broke up with him is because you told me to follow my heart. 
We were talking about law school! 
Cate, you re here. Good. 
Daddy thinks I'm fickle. 
 Sweetheart� you are fickle. 
Gang up on me. What is 
this an intervention? 
Bridget, you cannot do this to Donny. 
Can't you see you're wrong? 
You� Cate, tell her. 
Look, Paul, we ve already talked to her. She's a big girl. 
She's gonna do what she's gonna do. 
 Okay, you guys, look just, stop worrying! Now that I'm going out with 
Donny, I'm gonna break it off with Damian. 
Well, if that's your final decision... 
I'll just wait five minutes. 
Bridge, Donny is risking everything for you and you kind of like him. 
You gotta let him go. 
Would it kill you, for once in your life, to listen to your dad? 
I'm listening. I am listening. 
Now, if you guys don't mind, I have a date with Donny and this skirt is way too long. 
Bridget! 
Bridget will be right down. - Thanks. 
So, have you decided? - Decided 
what? - Hanging or firing squad? 
Rory! - I'd go for hanging, it breaks 
the neck, you don't feel a thing. 
Get out! Get out! 
Hey, Bridget. 
 Hey, Donny. 
You look so beautiful. 
 Thanks. 
I'm glad I dashed my childhood dreams for you. 
Oh my god! - You okay, Mr. Hennessy? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. You have fun. 
I have a great night planned. - Cool. 
Actually, you know what, Donny, I can't do this. - Do what? 
You know, quitting Navy College and risking hanging is like the sweetest thing anyone's ever done for me. 
Thanks. - But, I d hate 
to see you risk your whole future just because you re crazy over me. 
I mean, I understand it� but, god, I can't believe I m saying this� I may not be worth it. 
But Bridget, you� - No, don't say anything. 
Okay. My mind s made up. 
But� - Donny, you have to go back to school, okay. Here s your pin. 
You back so soon? 
 You were listening. 
No, I was not listening. 
And I am so proud of you. That was a 
tremendous sacrifice you made, Bridget. 
Well, you know, it was the right thing to do. It was actually you, Dad. 
I mean, you told me not to be selfish cause I could be ruining his future. 
You listened. I can't tell you 
how much this means to me. 
Besides, when he got all cleaned up and the bristle marks faded, he lost, like, half his hotness. 
 No, stop right there. You listened. 
You listened to your Dad! - Now, 
he's not even nearly as hot as Damian. 
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah! You 
listened! - I m gonna call Damian. 
You listened! 
Hello? Anybody out there? 
We re out of toilet paper. 
Again! How could we possibly go 
through a twenty pack in two days? 
Is anyone out there? Please. 
Alright, I hope everybody read my column. 
 Yeah, this is Mrs. Hennessy. 
Mom? 
My my keys! Where are my keys! 
 Mom?  Oh my god! 
This wasn't supposed to happen, Mom. 
Not now. 
Not at forty-six. 
He was supposed to be back in ten minutes. 
He was running a stupid errand. 
He was supposed to be back. 
And he was taking us to school. 
#8 SIMPLE RULES# It was a day I�ll never forget. 
It was just me and the 'Splendid Splinter.' 
I drove him around the entire base. 
 Wow. 
Hand me those pliers, son. 
Hey, what happened to the mitt there? 
Did you punch something? 
 No. 
I burned it on a casserole dish. 
Okay. 
Did you know the bathroom is the most important room in the house? 
It is. It's the only place a man 
can find complete solitude. 
What about women? 
 Pssh women. 
Women just don't get it. 
Oh, they go in and they do their, well, you know bathroom stuff, but us men, it's our sanctuary. 
Now the women, they�re more communal. 
They go to the bathroom together. 
Do you believe that? 
Together. 
You know, us men, we�re solitary beasts. 
Yeah, we like our alone time. 
And we sure as heck wouldn�t pick this wallpaper. 
Actually this kinda was my dad's real office. 
If he had a deadline he'd be in here for hours. 
Every once in awhile, Mom would knock on the door to make sure he �didn't fall in. 
You see, your dad got it. 
Yeah, it used to be a man's home was his castle, and slowly women just took it away and took it away and we�re down to this one little room. 
Well, it's all yours now. 
Yeah? 
 Yeah, certainly. 
It only stands to reason. 
I'm kinda mad at him, Gramps. 
Yeah, I know. I know, Rory. 
It's okay. 
It�s a lot to try to make sense of. 
Hand me those needle-nose pliers. 
Hey, guys oh, that�s so sweet. 
Um, can I just change in here. 
Mom, Fred Doyle is planning on having dinner with Dad and Jesus in heaven? 
Come on. 
It's a nice thought. 
Yeah, but Dad spent three years avoiding the Doyles' family barbecue. 
How's he gonna get out of that one? 
I mean, Dad's a terrible liar and Jesus is gonna be sitting like, right there. 
Yeah, and Fred going on about the differences between electric and gas powered weed whackers. 
Like Jesus isn't gonna wanna back out of that dinner. 
I'm so proud of you guys. 
I can�t imagine going through a day like this without you kids. 
Maybe if Dad had looked in the drawer and saw the batteries he wouldn't have gone to the store and then. 
Kerry, Care Bear, don't drive yourself crazy going over and over everything. 
No one can control what happened. 
God, Mom, you are so strong. 
Oh, no, trust me I fall apart when nobody�s looking. 
The last words I said to Dad was �I hate you. 
Oh, honey. 
He wouldn't let me borrow his stupid car and I said, �I hate you.' 
I had my Dad, and the last words I ever said to him were 'I hate you. 
Oh, baby, I think those were the first words you said to him also. 
It's okay. 
He knew how much you loved him no question. 
My last words were an insult, too. 
He was wearing his Michigan sweatshirt with chinos, and I said there weren't enough queer eyes in all of San Francisco to help him. 
Well, I sent him to the store for milk. 
So, the last thing he heard out of me was �blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.' 
You know what his last words were to me? 
What? 
'Hasta la vista, baby.' 
Such a cornball. 
You know, he would say anything. 
He didn�t care how silly he was. 
He just wanted to make us laugh. 
I am really gonna miss that. 
So, somebody�s gonna have to take up the cornball slack around here. 
I vote Rory. 
You know what I'm gonna miss about Dad? 
Those bogus pancakes he used to make. 
God, it was like eating Tupperware covers. - They were so awful. 
Pancake mix and water, how do you mess that up? 
Well, if they�re so terrible why�d you eat them? 
Same reason you did. 
It made him happy. 
You hear that, Dad? 
Our secret's out. 
I never ate the pancakes. 
Oh, come here, honies, Come here. 
Oh, I love you. 
I love you. 
Gramps? 
 Yeah? 
What was your dad like? 
Well, my dad, well, you�re great-granddad, was a businessman. 
He owned a haberdashery. 
 Habi what? 
A men�s store. 
He sold suits and hats. 
Baseball hats? 
 No. 
No, not baseball hats. 
Bowlers, fedoras, derbies. 
You know, beautiful hats that you tipped at young ladies and wore over your heart when they played the National Anthem. 
Yeah hats were the cornerstone of civilization. 
Only savages didn't wear hats. 
Were you close with your dad? 
Eh, it was a different time. 
My dad wasn't always a a happy man. 
They said it was because of his job. 
It didn't fit. 
A man�s job has to fit his spirit. 
Now, your dad's job was a perfect fit for his spirit. 
I don't know, he was always so mad when he was writing. 
Rory, do you know what I do now? 
Gram says eat, sleep and drink and drive without your glasses. 
You gotta love her. 
Rory, I build birdhouses. 
And while I'm building them I'm banging my knuckles, and cutting my hands and cussing, and throwing things. 
Then about a month later some beautiful finch or waxwing moves in and I don't give a second thought to all the cuts and scrapes. 
That was my process. 
The same with your dad. 
It's what he had to do to get to the good stuff. 
You know, had to bang his knuckles and whatnot. 
It�s what you�re doing right now. 
I'm not following you. 
Well, you�re upset with your dad for dying. 
And it's okay to slam a door, or you know, cry, and get angry, burn your hand on a casserole. 
That's your process. 
Do you know anything about plastering? 
Well, I know a little. 
Why? 
Yeah, I think we can handle that. 
Rory, did your dad ever tell you that he loved you? 
Yeah, tons. 
 And did you tell him? 
Yeah. 
All the time. 
Well, the closest my dad and I ever came was when I returned from Korea. 
You know, when I met Ted Williams. 
He said he missed me. 
What'd you say? 
 I said I missed him, too. 
And then we shook hands from about three feet away. 
I think we both felt you know, the same way about the love stuff. 
But it sure would�ve been nice if one of us just said it out loud. 
Gramps? 
 Yeah. 
How are you with broken lamps? 
No. 
Hmm. 
Your father never missed a deadline in his life. 
Okay, it�s gonna be really hard. 
Let's just, uh, let�s go in there, find your dad's column and get out. 
Come on. 
Oh my God. I drew this. 
It�s my giraffe. 
Dad kept it. 
 Oh, honey, he kept all your artwork. 
Uh, you know, I think 'giraffe' is spelled wrong. 
I was three! And by the 
way, it is spelled right. 
I can't believe he kept this. 
 What is it? 
It was from when we were in Indian Chiefs together like ten years ago. 
Well, of course he kept it. 
I didn't make it. 
He did. 
What is it? 
Is it an ashtray? 
I think it�s supposed to be a pencil holder. 
Wow! Bridget's 
report card from the third grade. 
You can tell by all the 'C's. 
 Wait! Let me see. 
Oh my gosh, it so is. 
And they�re 'C pluses.' 
Look, my first 'B.' 
I can't believe Dad didn't throw this out. 
Maybe he wanted something from when you were at your academic peak? 
Shut up. 
Oh my God. I don�t believe this. 
That idiot. - What is it? 
These are all these pictures that I made him throw out because I looked bad. 
He kept �em. 
Oh he even took this one out of the trash and taped it together. 
You know, I'm not saying I don�t believe, I'm just saying it�s awfully hard to feel close to a God that would do something like this. 
I just keep feeling like a terrible mistake has been made. 
I just hope you don't take it personal. 
Be patient. 
Don�t leave now. 
I just already feel so damn alone. 
I'm not sorry I said 'damn. 
Well, it�s all cleaned up downstairs. 
Who are you talking to? 
 Nobody. 
Oh, I thought I heard absolutely nothing. 
So, you're gonna sleep here tonight, huh? 
That�s a big move for you. 
Well, I keep putting off my first night in here alone. 
I can't do it forever. 
It�s so weird. 
It always felt so small in here with the both of us banging around in the morning. 
Now it just feels so big. 
Well, why, why don�t I just sit here at the end of the bed until you fall asleep like I used to do when you were little. 
I won't say a word. 
I'll just, I�ll just sit there. 
 No, it's okay, Mom. 
It�s okay. 
I love you, Mom. 
I love you, Cate. 
So, I�ll you know, just sleep on the couch. 
Okay. 
You know, don't, don�t worry about me. 
I�ll be fine. 
Oh, hi, Dad. - I just changed 
the bulb in the hall. It was out. 
Unless you want it completely dark. 
Oh no no, thanks. 
Thank you. 
Damn near killed myself. 
Do you wanna come in? 
 Yeah, sure. 
Oh, come on. 
Just sit down. 
Dad? 
What? 
Well, I, uh I think I found Paul's last article. 
Oh, you did? 
 Yeah. 
And you all laughed at me when I said I took a computer course at the Rec. 
Center. 
I don't wanna toot my own horn but... - Dad, the article. 
Oh, yeah, well I found it in the 'Recycling Bin.' 
I don�t think he thought it was very good. 
We spent five hours at that desk. 
Well, it's kinda like cleaning out an attic. 
If you just did the work, you'd be out in thirty minutes. 
It's it�s the memories that slow you down. 
Oh, Dad, why did this happen? 
We don't deserve this. 
That's 'cause we live under the impression that we get what we deserve. 
If I got what I deserved, I�d never have you and your sister in my life. 
Oh, Dad! - No, seriously. What have I 
ever done to deserve two such angels? 
Or Rory? 
Or Kerry, Bridget? 
And, for part of my life, your mother. 
Yeah, we just gotta be thankful for the time we have left with people. 
And always let them know how you feel. 
Sounds like somebody's been going to church? 
Don't tell your mother. 
It's our little secret. 
I love you, Cate. 
I'm just sorry I don't say it enough. 
And yet I know it. 
�Night. 
 �Night, Dad. 
Oh, Paul God forbid you should move something and look. 
Mom? 
Oh, hi, Beach. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. 
No, not really. 
Can I sleep with you? 
 Oh, come on. 
Come here. 
Oh, come on. 
Come on. 
Well, I�ve got something, you guys. 
What is that? 
 It was dad's last article. 
Grandpa found it. - Oh my God, 
mom, read it. Yeah, read it. 
Yeah, okay, well, I'm going to. 
It doesn't have a title or anything, so, so I'll just start. 
"Okay readers, today we're having a little pop quiz. 
It's multiple choice. 
So, sharpen your number two pencils and put on your thinking caps. 
Ready, here's a quote, 'Dad, you're an idiot. 
Now contestants, this was said to me because of which of the following transgressions: A) Coming to the breakfast table wearing pajamas and black socks? 
B) Asking my oldest daughter if that guy I saw her talking to at school yesterday was her boyfriend? 
C) Referring to rapper 'Fitty Cent' as 'Fifty cents'? 
Or D) Entering the room? 
Okay, pencils down. 
Actually it was a trick question. 
The answer is all of the above. 
Now, do you know how many times I called my father an idiot? 
Zero. 
Why? 
Because I feared him. 
Back then we didn't share our deep personal feelings. 
Our deepest conversations usually revolved around the Tigers' bullpen. 
But my kids, I can't get them to shut up! 
There�s not a feeling that my kids are afraid to express, over and over and over. 
And my wife reassures me this is a good thing, over and over and over. 
And she's always right. 
So, do I wish that my kids feared me? 
Well, my house would be quieter and I'd spend a lot less time in the bathroom, but no. 
Because I know that whenever they insult me, whether it's a 'You're an idiot,' 'What a geek,' or an 'I hate you,' an 'I love you' isn't far behind. 
And it's the knowledge that my wife and kids love me that makes it safe for me to wear pajamas and black socks to the breakfast table. 
Oh my God. 
Dad, thank you. 
That's all he wrote. 
That was enough. 
 Yeah. 
Now I wish we insulted him more. 
Okay, guys, it's bedtime. 
Alright, move over. 
Rory, move over. 
 I'm over as far as I can get. 
Rory, when was the last time you cut your toenails? 
Probably the last time you shaved your legs. 
Mom, you're laughing. Why? 
 Oh, God only knows. 
Look at all of themakeup Bridget bought. Can you believe it? 
Look� fourteen dollars for whatever this is. 
Eyelash curler. 
And thank heavens she got more lip junk. 
Lip gloss. 
Rory, there's a ball game on channel seven. Watch it. 
Hey, guys. 
 Hey, Care Bear, look at this, this� You know, not now, Dad. I have 
to get ready for my date with Kyle. 
Wait, that's your stuff? 
 I can't believe it's already so late. 
I still have to straighten my hair, crimp my eyelashes, create cheekbones out of practically nothing which is totally your fault� flat faced. 
Flat� flat� I do not have a flat face. Come on. 
Well, anyone looks flat in a toaster. 
Look Kerry, I�ve got to tell you something in all seriousness, ever since you started dating Kyle you've changed. 
You're different. You're more... 
 More Bridgetty. 
Rory! You�re more Bridgetesque. 
You know, how could you compare me to Bridget? 
Where�s my new sparkle lip gloss. 
Okay, I know I bought new sparkle lip gloss. 
Oh my God, where�s my new sparkle lip gloss? 
Is this it? 
 He touched it all over. 
I miss the old Kerry. - The depressed 
one without a boyfriend? 
Yeah. 
Why do bad things always happen to me? 
Bridget, nothing bad ever happens to you. 
Yeah. But today, I heard 
Mom is gonna teach sex ed. 
In my class. 
 It's true. 
Dad, why do bad things happen to superficial people? - Rory! 
Rory, I don't know but I know why bad things happen to smart alecks. 
'Smart aleck'? You know, 
words hurt, Dad. Flat face. 
So, what, you're teaching sex education? 
The school needed a nurse to fill in because Miss Callahan got the 'flu.' 
Really? I heard she got knocked up. 
So you just say �yes� without even totally considering how it could completely ruin my life? 
Bridget I think it's an honor your mother is going to teach you sexual education. 
After all, she taught me. 
Do you guys not understand what situation I'm in here? 
I mean, Donny Doyle�s coming in this weekend to see me. - So? 
So, people already perceive my dating Donny as a slap in the face, I mean, you know he's older, he goes to the Naval Academy instead of a school, and then Danielle's going to this party this weekend, and she's all 'You better be there' and I'm, 'Yeah' but Donny's, 'No, I don't wanna share you,' which is actually very sweet, but that�s just the sort of thing Danielle�s gonna use against me, and then you have to go and exacerbate the whole thing by teaching sex ed at my school. 
On the bright side, she did say 'exacerbate.' 
Yeah, honey, I think you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion. 
You wanna weigh in here, Paul? 
Look, it's just two classes. 
And I will try very hard not to draw attention to the fact that I'm your mom. 
And that's how Bridget was born. 
#8 SIMPLE RULES FOR DATING MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER# This movie sounds good. 'High 
octane butt kicking from start to finish.' 
Far be it from me to disagree with Jeff Paisley from the Shreveport Town Crier. 
But I really wanted to see... 
It means, 'Love is the water of the heart.' 
That doesn't sound as full of high octane. 
Come on, Kyle. It�s made by this really 
amazing avant garde French director. 
He uses silence in a way that it almost becomes a character. 
This guy? He uses his 
butt cheeks to talk. 
We can't even agree on a movie. 
Sometimes I feel like we have nothing in common. 
Yeah. I know what you mean. 
Wanna make out? 
 Sure. 
Whoa� hey, Lord of the Manor present. 
We weren't doing anything.. 
 Oh my god, Dad do you have to... 
Walk in on you and your boyfriend? 
Yes. 
Do I have to call that your 'boyfriend'? Yes. 
Do I have to torture you with a dance like� instead of leaving you alone? No� 
but you did call me a flat face. You still here? 
No. - Thank you. 
 Call me later. 
So, Care Bear, I hear you�re interested in seeing that new French movie. 
How long were you standing there? 
 Don't worry, I had a chair. 
Listen, I was thinking, you know what might be fun is if, we sort of saw that movie together tonight. Sort of 
a father daughter foreign film night. 
I'd rather stay home. 
Good. Hey Kerry, we�re going to have a 
father daughter stay at home dance night. 
Yeah� get your groove on. 
Okay, okay� we'll go to the movie! Just stop doing that! 
Works every time. 
Hey, Cate. 
 Oh, hi honey. 
Kerry and I are going to see a foreign film tonight. - That's so nice. 
You know we're not sitting together, right? 
I'm excited, too! 
Okay, Mom. I parked the car. 
It's all snug in its spot in the garage just like how Dad's sperm snugly parked itself into your egg when you decided to have sex and ruin my life. 
I came up with a little car analogy for the class. 
Cute. What do you mean �little� car? 
It was the worst day of my entire life. 
Worse than the time you wore a black skirt and a black top to school and you didn't notice they were two different blacks till you got home and I showed you? 
That's it, Rory! We're canceling Bravo. 
You said you wouldn't embarrass me, Mom. 
You said no one would know you were my mother. 
I know honey and I was trying so hard not to, it just blurted out. 
You could have stopped at how I was conceived. 
You didn't have to tell them where. 
You don't even like the beach! God, this is so unfair! 
Did she say penis? - I am never 
showing my face at that school again. 
Penis and vagina? 
 Rory, we don't say those words. 
Why not? 
 I don't know. 
Did you have a rough day today? 
 No it wasn't that bad. 
But I found out tomorrow I have to talk about contraception, and the only thing the school will let me discuss is abstinence. 
Finally, our tax dollars put to good use. 
I don't know, I think it�s irresponsible to say abstinence is the only option. 
I see teenagers at the hospital every day and they're in trouble already. 
They need to know about safe sex. 
Or, you could teach them that sex is bad. 
That if they have it they�ll go blind or go to hell. 
You're the teacher. You decide. 
Hi, guys. How was the movie? 
Fine. 
Did something happen? 
There was this scene, this scene was so incredibly... 
European. 
Hot sex? 
 Rory! 
Sorry. Did I crack your code? 
So what did you do? 
 Nothing. 
You did nothing? - Yes, I did nothing. 
What else could I do? 
Well, you could have left. 
Oh, yeah. I never thought of that. 
I�ll go talk to her. 
It�s okay. 
Wow, you saw the water bottle scene with Kerry? 
You know about the water bottle scene? 
Oh yeah. The water 
bottle scene�s famous. 
All my friends are downloading it off the Internet. Not me, though. 
Because I'm not old enough to see that kind of thing. 
And it's illegal. 
And it objectifies women. 
Wait a minute, all your little friends are watching that scene from that movie? 
The water bottle scene is like my generation's Pam Anderson/Tommy Lee tape. 
Which of course, I have not seen either. 
But, maybe you should take Kerry to see it. 
Well, it�s getting late. 
 Yes, it is. 
How do you say goodnight? 
And your mom's the teacher. 
I'll call you next week. 
Will you? Well, thanks so much. 
I had loads of fun. 
 So did I. 
Goodnight, Woody. 
 Goodnight, Anne. 
And thus Woody leaves, knowing with great pride that this is another night he did not have sex. 
Okay. So, that's abstinence. 
Clearly it's been around forever. 
Yo, Ms. Henn, that movie was 
all rated 'G' and what not. 
Nah, it was less than 'G,' it was like... 'F.' 
Yeah, Woody's got no game. 
Look, if you have something to say, please raise your hand. 
Anthony. - Yeah, dawg be cold saying 
hasta to a lady with such a fine, cup sitting booty like that. 
But I'll bet my money that dawg be walking all swishy swishy, playing for the other team and what not, you know what I'm saying? 
We all have certain urges. 
Hey Bridget, your mom just said �urges.� - Kill me. 
And if you respect yourself, you will shut down those urges. 
She totally said it again. 
And then, when you�ve finally made a commitment to get married, and you finally satisfy those urges... 
Stop saying �urges!� 
There are other words. 
It will be all that much sweeter because you waited. 
Waited? 
Dang, this sucks! 
She's trying to turn us into a bunch of Woodys. 
All right, kids. Okay. I could get 
in big trouble for telling you this, but there are alternatives to abstinence. 
What are some of those alternatives, Bridget's mom? 
Well, Jenna, rather than speak in generalities, why don�t we just answer some of those questions you submitted to Miss Callahan last week? 
Let�s see. 
'I have a much older boyfriend who lives in Maryland. 
He's coming to visit me this weekend and I'm feeling pressure to have sex. 
What should I do? 
And I think you should know, I'm really gorgeous.' 
Well, I�ll tell what you should do. 
ABSTINENCE Abstinence! Abstinence. 
You hear me, missy?! 
Whoever you are. 
Paul, how many times you gonna read that thing? 
The words aren't gonna change. 
Donny Doyle is coming over to our house to have sex with our daughter. 
Oh, he's gonna be having sex all right, but it's not gonna be with our daughter. 
What does that mean? 
 I don't know. 
You just gave me this ten minutes ago. I'm still formulating a plan. 
I'm just so disappointed with myself. 
I sounded like my mother. I actually 
think I said the word 'missy.' 
And I actually believed Donny when he told me that he was choosing celibacy. 
A teenage boy doesn't choose celibacy. 
Celibacy chooses you� him� a teenage boy. 
What are we gonna do? 
Look, Cate. We can't just talk 
to Bridget about contraception. 
You might as well just fluff her pillows and make her some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
You are aware, Paul, that only works for you. 
Don't you see, that if we do that, it�d be like we're giving her permission to have sex. And if 
we tell her �you can't have sex�, you know she's definitely gonna have it. 
Why couldn't she have been born hideously ugly? 
Ugly people have sex, too. 
I just, you know, it's just such a confusing time for these kids. 
The media bombards them with all these sex images. 
Why do they have to make it look so damn appealing? 
I blame the French and their crazy sex water. 
As do we all, Paul. 
Okay look, you know we are going to have to talk to her. 
Fine. We'll talk to her 
before her date with Donny. 
It's so hard to be a girl. 
You like a guy so much and you just want to be with him, it feels so right. 
Is that how you feel about me? 
Sometimes. 
 Sometimes? 
Oh, God help us. 
People were butt naked, moaning like no tomorrow, and I'm sitting like this close to Dad. 
Hello, my social standing could be impacted for decades the way Mom's talking about how everyone has these urges. 
Oh yeah? Well I started to 
choke on a popcorn kernel and oxygen cut off to my brain and everything went black. 
Mom said 'vulva.' 
You win. 
Kerry, could you go downstairs for a second? We wanna talk to your sister. 
Sure, Mom. Dad. 
 Kerry. 
I want to look absolutely perfect for my date with Donny tonight. 
What do you think of this top? 
 I think it should stay on. 
I need something that says I'm older, more sophisticated. 
Something that says I'm a woman. 
�Cause tonight's a big night. 
No, tonight is not the big night and do you wanna know why? 
I'll tell you why. Cate? 
Honey, your Dad and I were together for a long time before we had a 'big night.' 
And might I add, we were deliriously happy with all of our little nights. 
Years and years of little nights, little teenie weenie nights. 
He said �teenie weenie.� 
 Bridget.  What? 
Look, what we're trying to say is that sex is a big step. For all of us. 
And we in no way want you to have sex. We are not giving you permission. 
What are you talking about? - Fine. 
You want me to say it? I�ll say it. 
safe sex, condoms, you know the drill. 
Look, what your father is trying to say is that when it comes to sex, we trust you to act responsibly. 
What is with you people? 
You're all just sex, sex, sex. 
It's like you have a one track mind and it's all... whatchamacallit... sex. 
Honey, we know you wrote that question. 
What question? 
From the girl whose boyfriend is coming from Maryland and he's coming to town to, you know. 
You thought that was me? 
No, that was totally written by that new girl who came from Maryland Lara O'Neal. 
And she's definitely not gorgeous. 
Talk about over inflated self esteem. 
If somebody's willing to sleep with her, she should jump on it. 
Looks like someone got a little paranoid. 
Oh gosh, I gotta go. 
How do I look? Wow. Really good. 
Bridge, since, you and Donny aren't having sex, what's up for tonight? 
PG movie, home by eleven, you know the drill. 
You know after the movie why don't you and Donny stop by so we can say hi? 
No. I told the Doyles after the movie, 
I'd be Mary Ellen's partner in Bible Trivia. 
Godspeed. 
Oh my God, this movie sounds amazing. 
I'd show you the water bottle scene, but my Dad made me delete it from my hard drive. 
Luckily, I've got it all up here. 
Hey. 
 Hey. Out. 
Hi. 
You know, I was a jerk the other day. 
I was totally wrong about that French movie. 
It was important to you, all right? 
And I think we should really go see it. 
You heard about the scene? 
There's a sexy water bottle scene? I had no idea. 
Go home. 
I hate having a smart girlfriend. 
Dad. 
 Kerry. Care Bear, hang on. 
Wait a second. You know 
what? We have to talk. 
I don't wanna talk! - I think we 
should, about the moo� the� you know, what we saw the other day. 
 What? What? 
It�s just that, you know, remember when that guy came with the... 
well, the truth, the thing is� you know what? 
Never mind. Carry on, goodnight. 
No, wait. No, not goodnight! Dad, we 
have nothing to be embarrassed about. 
You're right. �Night. 
 No, wait. Dad! 
Come here, sit down. 
Okay, you were thinking, should you cover my eyes? 
Or, should you laugh? Or 
should you just do nothing, because, you know, let me draw my own conclusions and instead of treating me like a child? - Yes, that was one! 
Right, okay, but you have to admit it was really weird. 
Oh, God. That was one of the 
weird� especially� I could� Okay, Dad, stop. Stop worrying. 
I mean, I'm not scarred for life. 
And despite being temporarily totally creeped out, I didn't hate having a father daughter thing. 
Good. 
 Okay. 
So we can do this again sometime? 
 Yeah. In like a billion years. 
It's a date. 
The boy! 
Come here. Hey! Right 
here, sit down, park it. 
Hey, Ror. Boy, I�ll tell you 
something. It is not �E A S Y� 
being the father of teenage girls. 
But I think I'm really evolving. 
And as for you, young man, did you delete your downloaded movies? 
Look, 'Officer Internet', if you're so worried about obscene material, you should probably take a look across the street. 
 What do you mean? 
Your daughter's alone with a sex starved sailor who hasn't seen a woman in months. 
Rory, she is not alone. 
She's with the Doyles. 
And even if she wasn�t, I trust my daughter. 
Does it concern you that the Doyles' motor home is not in the driveway? 
No. There could be a thousand reasons 
why their camper's not in the driveway. 
Like it's in Branson with the rest of the Doyles? 
Where it's been since Thursday? 
Where they're celebrating the Osmond family reunion? 
Cate, are you hearing this? 
 Bible trivia, my ass! 
I hate the French! 
Back to the Internet. 
Lara O'Neal? Lara O'Neal? 
Lara O'Neal, new girl from Maryland? 
Does anyone know a Lara O'Neal? 
Anyone? 
I'm sick. 
Good morning! 
 Good morning! 
Happy Thanksgiving, Dad. 
 You're in a good mood. 
Well, why wouldn't I be? 
I have a lot to be thankful for. 
Dad, what the hell are you doing? 
I thought I'd start Thanksgiving dinner. 
I've always wanted to take a stab at cooking. 
Where do you keep the... 
 Turkeys? 
Aprons. And the turkey. 
You know, Dad, I really appreciate the gesture, but are you sure you wanna start something that you've... 
well, never done before? 
Well, I didn't hear any complaining about me babysitting the kids last night. 
Babysitting? You watched TV. 
Are any of them missing? Any 
broken bones? You're welcome. 
Look, Dad, why don't... 
here... sit down. 
Why don't you start slowly by just... 
helping... oh, I got it... 
Here's a can. Here's 
a can opener. - I'm on it. 
Hey, Gramps. Wanna watch 
the game with me? 
I can't, Rory. 
I'm busy opening a can. 
There, it's done. You 
know, after all that, I may have to take a little break. 
Mom, are those grocery bags? 
 From the grocery store? 
Mom, please tell me that you're not planning on cooking Thanksgiving dinner. 
You said we were going to go to a restaurant for a quick meal. 
Yes, because it didn't seem right this year, remember? 
Well, you know... 
I know I said that a couple of days ago, but then last night... 
I couldn't sleep and... 
suddenly I knew why I know exactly how you feel. 
I get up two or three times a night. 
Thank you, Dad. 
But what I meant was... 
I suddenly realized that I could blow off Thanksgiving or I could choose to enjoy the day. 
You know, sometimes it's four or five... 
if I drink anything after three o'clock in the afternoon I'm a racehorse. 
Dad, just go open some more cans. 
Okay, Mom, can we revisit the 'blow off Thanksgiving' thing? 
I mean, 'cause we kind of made a choice to... 
go to a party after the restaurant. 
 On Thanksgiving? 
Technically, it's an after-Thanksgiving party. See, the Burgess family 
eats real, real early and Amanda's older brother is coming home from college and he's bringing a bunch of friends home, 'cause they can't go home for the holidays and Amanda gets to bring a few friends too, you know, 'cause it makes it even. 
So, Mom, it's a major coup that Kerry even got invited, and even though you think it's just 'cause I'm her big sister, but I have to say I think Kerry finally made it on her own merits. 
Yay, Kerry! 
 Yay, me! 
Well, you know girls, as proud of you as I am... give me a break. 
But, Mom, we already made plans with Kyle and Luke. 
Look, I'm sorry but... who's Luke? 
 My safety bad boy. 
See, Damian's out of town and I just don't want to be alone on the holidays. 
Still 'no'. 
Look, you guys, I put a lot of effort into this. 
I even have some surprises planned. 
We're gonna have a fun Thanksgiving. Just family. 
Damn! I spilled it everywhere. 
In theory. 
 Fine.  Whatever. 
The doorbell. Gee, I wonder who 
that could be on Thanksgiving? 
Don't you, Rory? - I don't know, 
Mom. The Thanksgiving Bunny? 
Hi, Tommy! What are you doing here? 
Would you like to come in? 
I don't have time to come in now, Cate. 
Because I'm heading down to the stadium to see the Lions game. 
If only I had someone to take. 
Some boy... I can't do it, Cate. 
Come on kid, you coming or not? 
You got tickets to the Lions game? 
Oh, man! Thanks, Mom! 
Tommy, thanks. - You're welcome. 
That'll be two hundred bucks. 
What am I saying? It's 
Thanksgiving. One fifty. 
Fine, on me. 
But he buys his own beer. 
That's going to be blue in the morning. 
How much to take my dad? 
Hey, girls, listen. 
I sent Rory to the football game because I wanted him to be happy. 
And I want you to be happy, too. So... 
 So you're gonna let us go to the party? 
Thank you, Mom, thank you! 
 Well, no. 
But, you can invite Kyle and 'safety bad-boy' to have dinner with us. 
And guess who else is joining us? Grandma! 
This just... - ...keeps getting better 
and better. Thank you, Mom! 
Happy Thanksgiving. 
God, are you out of your mind? 
 No, no, here's the plan, okay. 
We've got the guys in the house. 
At the perfect moment when Mom's in a good mood, Luke will turn on his charm, she'll gaze in his soulful puppy dog eyes, and then she'll be mesmerized and we are so at that party. 
Okay, Bridget. Please stop 
before you say "girlfriend". 
I mean, this plan is... 
 ...is all we've got.  Word. 
Come on, third and goal. 
Please god, it's third and goal. 
The Lions versus the Packers. 
Were you expecting the Lions versus the Christians? 
Come on, guys, I'm trying to watch the game. 
There's no game going on. 
All I see are fireworks, the giant scoreboard telling us when to cheer. I mean... 
What the hell was that? 
I'm going to go get myself... 
 Don't forget your diet. 
...a carrot. I'm gonna go 
get myself a carrot. 
Before they stop selling them at the half. Got it? - Got it. 
You know, I was at the stadium all the time with your father. - Yeah, me too. 
Well, you're the man of the house, now. - I am? 
It's not just a saying. 
All those women in your house, and no one to keep an eye on 'em. 
And your sisters, come on. 
Look, see your dad knew that there are a lot of creepy guys out there who are just gonna pounce on them like wolves. 
Wow, I never thought of it like that. 
Well not everyone is sensitive like you or me. 
Hey, look at the jugs on her. 
Mom, it's so good to have you here. 
Guess who sat next to me on the plane? An Indian. 
I mean, what are the odds, on Thanksgiving, that I would be sitting next to an Indian? 
Gram, it's 'Native American. 
 Oh, God, you sound just like him. 
You know what, Grandma, that was a great story. How 'bout you finish your coffee... 
Mom... let's get dinner going. 
I'm just very hungry. 
Hey, Dad. Guess who 
decided to join us. 
Jim. Hi, kiddo. 
 Hey, Gram. 
What kind of charade is this? 
 What are you talking about? 
This. Just because it's Thanksgiving 
you think you can get your mother and me to reconcile. 
No, I don't. 
 Good. 
So, Rory, how was the game? - Okay. 
You're cooking? 
 Don't act so surprised. 
Like you've never seen me in the kitchen before. - I haven't. 
I mean, in all the years we were married. 
No wait, let me be fair. 
No, never. 
Cate, let me help. 
That's what I came here for. 
Sure, you fly in here one day, it's easy to look like a hero. 
Where were you this morning when I was opening cans? 
He opened cans? 
 Alright, you two look, if you wanna help just come help me set the table. Come on, Dad. 
God, they should be here by now. - Who should? 
Kerry, were you talking to someone? 
 I didn't hear anybody. 
Must be the wind. - Yeah, 
blowing through your empty head. 
Rory, everything you say to me goes in one ear and out the other. 
Hey. So you must be Luke. 
Yeah. Is Bridget here? 
So, I see you got a motorcycle. - Yeah. 
Bet you get a lot of ladies with it. - I do all right. 
So, is... is Bridget here? 
 Right, I have a message for you from your precious Bridget. 
'Thanks for the mono!' 
Mono? No, I don't have mono. 
Well then her message is, 'Sorry I gave you mono. 
Oh, man. Now, I gotta 
make a lot of calls. 
Child's play. 
I didn't know you made a pumpkin pie. 
Actually, Dad made that. 
Your dad? 
Yeah, you know, actually, Mom, ever since you separated, he's been doing a lot of things that are really uncharacteristic. 
Like doing laundry and not smoking in the bathtub. 
That's nice. 
He's seeing someone, isn't he? 
No! Why, Mom, do you care? 
No! Of course I don't care. 
Has he been whistling? Because 
that's a sure sign he's getting some. 
Ma, just so you know, I will never be old enough for us to have this conversation. 
Rory, you're gonna build a fire. 
It's a little cold in here. 
 Yeah.  Atta boy. 
Are you sure you opened the flue? 
 Yes, Grandpa, I'm sure. 
I watched my dad make fires all the time. 
You're using a starter log? 
Sort of cheating, isn't it? 
Yeah, well... fire's come a 
long way since your day. 
Yeah, you know what else we had in my day? 
A leather strap and a woodshed. 
So Luke's not here yet? 
 No. He hasn't shown up. 
I don't know what happened to him. - God. 
Now we're going to be stuck here all night. 
Our plan has gone awry. 
 'Awry'? 
Yeah, I know big words, too. 
You make the fire. - No, you 
make it. - No, you make it. 
No... alright, I'll make it. 
 Fine. 
Kerry, honey, would you go get your grandpa a nice sweater? 
Hey. - Hey, Kyle, 
what are you doing here? 
Oh, Kerry called me and invited me over for a little turkey. 
And then when Luke gets here, we're gonna sneak out over to Amanda's party. 
How awesome is that? 
 Pretty awesome. 
Wanna go toss the football? 
 Sure. 
Go long! Longer! Longer! 
Wow, I didn't think that was possible. 
Hey, have you seen Kyle? - Yeah, he's 
about two blocks away, waving his arms. 
What? - I threw him out. 
 Rory Hennessey, I am gonna kill you! 
What did he do to you? - Shannon told 
Jenna told Courtney from first period... 
not Courtney from gym class because Shannon and Courtney from gym class hate each other, because Shannon innocently pointed out that Courtney's boobs are two totally different. 
in front of someone who blabs, well, me... 
that you told Luke that I had mono! 
What's this about mono? 
 Well, this little slug threw both of our boyfriends out even though they were officially invited! 
They were gonna sneak out! - Can somebody 
please tell me what happened? 
Well, Jenna told Shannon who told Courtney... - Mom! 
We have to fix this now. 
 No, no. You're not going anywhere! 
We're gonna have dinner in a few minutes! Fix what? 
The girls are scamming us, Cate. 
What did you just call me? 
Jim, don't just sit there. Help. 
 Money, money. Who wants money? 
No, no, we don't do that here. 
We'll just hook up with them after we eat turkey. - Hook up with who? 
Wait a minute. Shouldn't we be 
smelling turkey right now? - God. 
Oh, this thing is nowhere near done. 
Alright, we're not having dinner for another couple of hours. 
A couple of hours? 
We don't have a couple of hours! 
Yes you do. 
Family meeting! 
What? Forget you and 
your stupid family meeting! 
Alright, now that is enough! 
Now, all I wanted was a nice Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. 
Is that too much to ask? 
 Don't worry, Cate. 
I'll handle the girls. - What? 
 Back me up on this. 
Alright. Everybody out of here, 
I need to talk to Rory. 
Did you see how they speak to me? - Sit. 
Alright, what is going on with you and your sisters? 
Come on. 
 I was trying to protect them. 
Well that's sweet. - I was afraid they 
were going to turn into big fat whores. 
Okay, not so sweet. 
How come? 
Well, at the football game, Tommy said I was the man of the house. - So? 
Well, when Dad used to cover the Tigers' away games when I was little, he'd always say, 'While I'm gone, Ror, you're the man of the house. 
But he'd always come back and I'm just afraid that if I don't fill his shoes, the girls are gonna turn into big, fat... - I know... 
I know. 
Honey, your job is to be a fourteen-year-old kid and kind of a pain in the ass. 
I can do that. 
 You're great at that. 
Don't take on this responsibility. 
You're the son. 
I'm the parent. 
I'll handle the girls. 
So... as a parent who has it 'handled', 
you do realize that while we're having this touchy-feely mother-son moment, the girls snuck out to Amanda's party. - Right. 
Momma H in the house! 
We'll just be in the other room having a non-alcoholic beverage. 
 Thanks a lot, guys. 
I can't believe that you girls would pull a stunt like this on Thanksgiving. 
I have been in that kitchen all day preparing dinner, your Grandma flew in from Florida, and your Grandpa even made a pie. 
I told you, you weren't going to this party! - We know, Mom. 
But don't you understand? 
This is the first Thanksgiving... 
I don't care that this is the first Thanks... 
Alright, look, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. 
I've been doing my best today, but this is no picnic for me either. 
The truth is I don't know what I'm doing. 
I'm just making this up as I go along. 
And something just tells me that the right thing to do is for us to have dinner in our home at our dining room table, with our family, even if this is the first Thanksgiving without your father. 
That was really nice, Mom. 
But what I was gonna say was... 
this is the first Thanksgiving that I actually got invited to Amanda's party and I really want to be here. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
But, Mom, what you said was really beautiful. 
Mom, why are you laughing? 
Mom, you're losing it. 
In front of our college friends. 
All I wanted was to have a normal Hennessy Thanksgiving. 
And I just realized I got it. 
With my teenage daughters trying to ditch me to go to a party. 
What could be more normal? 
I'm so glad we could make it so special. 
Well, bye. 
Oh, no. You're grounded. 
Now, get your things, let's go. 
And hurry up or I'll embarrass you. 
Bridget, Kerry... 
sorry I ruined your plans. 
Dance, monkey, dance. 
Girls, let go of him. - God, how 
much product do you use? 
Alright, come on. everybody help me 
get into the dining room. Come on. 
What? 
Dad, you're whistling. 
 I'm happy. 
Your mother wants to know if you guys are ready to eat. 
Since it's only eight o'clock at night, I wasn't sure. 
Dad? 
 Yeah, what honey? 
It's going to get easier, right? 
 That's what I'm hoping. 
Yeah, I just want to get all these 'firsts' over as fast as possible. 
Well, you got a lot of firsts to look forward to. 
You got the first graduation. 
The first wedding. 
The first grandchild... provided 
that comes after the first wedding. 
You know, Dad, you turned out to be a pretty great guy. 
Here comes your mother. 
Say that again. 
I hope everyone's worked up an appetite. - This just looks wonderful. 
Thanks for going to all this trouble. 
 Honey, it was no trouble. 
In fact, your father actually helped me. He opened a few cans. 
I've been working on myself. 
 I'll say. 
It turned out to be a pretty good Thanksgiving after all. 
Grandma's touching grandpa's cheek. 
Three kinds of potatoes! Anyone 
heard of Atkins in this family? 
Did you know the human body has twenty-seven feet of intestines? 
I plan to fill every inch of them. 
 Gross.  Gross, Rory. 
Well, Dad, here you go. 
Rory? Would you do the honor? 
Rory! Stop it! - Come on, we have 
enough! - Rory, come on! 
Rory, you missed a little on this side. - Rory! 
Oh, great. 
I�m getting a huge zit. 
Where? 
I don�t see anything. 
Oh, don�t pretend like you can�t see it. 
It�s right there. 
And it�s getting bigger by the second. 
Please don�t make me go to school. 
Okay, I get it. 
Listen, I know today�s gonna be difficult. 
But we have to start moving forward. 
You�ve you�ve already missed two weeks of school. 
We just have to start getting on with our lives. 
I just need one more day with some hot compresses, and I promise I�ll go back tomorrow. 
Honey, I don�t think staying home is the answer. 
Come on, Mom. What�s the big deal if we 
take one more day to feel sad? 
Honey, I just think we all have to start getting back to normal. 
Mom, if things were normal, Dad would be the one taking us to school. 
Yeah. Wearing those horrible, 
old people slippers. 
And making us �healthy� sack lunches, that we just threw out in the first available trash can.' 
Right, he was so lame. 
 God, what a geek. 
Dad. 
Look. 
I know this is tough. 
I I don�t really feel like going back to work today either. 
But we have to. 
So come on. 
Let�s do it. 
Um, you�re gonna take us to school in that? 
Yeah. 
 What is that? 
It�s a housecoat. - Well, maybe 
it�s called a housecoat �cause you should only wear it in the privacy of your own house. 
What is the big deal? 
No one�s gonna see me in the car. 
Damn right, they�re not. �Cause you�re gonna 
drop us like two blocks from school. 
Congratulations, Mom. 
You�re just as lame as Dad. 
Hey now, wait a minute. 
That�s so sweet. 
So, go change. 
And put a brush through your hair. 
 And a bra wouldn�t kill ya. 
#8 SIMPLE RULES# Wow. 
Who died? 
Oh, my God. 
I�m so sorry. 
I can�t believe I said that. 
What�s wrong with me? 
Bridget, nothing is wrong with you. 
This is all just really weird. 
Yeah, I know. 
Well, look, we have each other. 
 Yes, we�ll do this together. 
We missed you guys so much. 
 You did? 
But before I was an outcast, persona au gratin. 
Non grata. 
 Oui. 
Truly, the group was not the same without you. 
Uh, really? 
 Yeah. 
It�s just like in Charlie�s Angels how there�s a blonde, and a brunette and a kinda something else. 
We are so glad to have our blonde back. 
I�m blonde. 
 Yeah right, Danielle. So, get this. 
We were all totally obsessing about our dates for the dance on Friday night, and some people weren�t getting asked, and I won�t name names Dana. 
So we all decided we�d go stag and totally play the boys against each other. 
Oh, I think under the given circumstances that. 
Oh, I love that. 
Bridget? 
You�re really talking about this? 
Yeah, did you hear their strategy? 
It is very clever. 
Yeah. 
About a stupid dance. 
Don�t you think this inane conversation is just a little bit too soon? 
Yeah, you�re right. 
But if it weren�t, oh my gosh, I have the greatest idea we plan a song list that is just one hot, sexy song after another, and then we torture the guys by only dancing with each other. 
Now that is brilliant. 
No, I was just building off what you were already doing. 
No way, that was way more brilliant. 
 No, well, you�re brillianter. 
Ugh nice life. 
Oh, hey guys. 
You didn�t ring the doorbell. 
 Yeah, that�s strange. 
�Cause I always ring the doorbell when I come into my own house. 
Well, maybe if you�d have rung the bell, you�d have noticed that I fixed it. 
Oh, that�s nice. 
Well, aren�t you gonna try it? 
 What? 
The doorbell. 
I believe you that you fixed it. 
Well, when I said I fixed it, maybe I was being unnecessarily modest. 
You know, I�m talking three hours at the hardware store trying out doorbells �til I found the exact right one that says, �This is where the Hennessy�s live." 
Rory, would you do the honor? 
Wow. 
You really nailed us. 
I know. 
Rory, did you do your homework? 
Actually, my teachers said it was optional for me. 
I could do it if I felt like it. 
Well, I�m sure they�re just trying to be nice. 
Everyone�s being so weird, lately. 
They picked me first for football even though I suck. 
Missy Kleinfeld who never talks to me was talking to me. 
And the cafeteria lady gave me all this extra milk. 
Apparently, pity milk doesn�t come in chocolate. 
Hey, honey, how was school? 
Horrible. 
Everyone was all fake and phony. 
It made me sick. 
God, I hate everyone. 
All I want to do is be alone for the rest of my life. 
Bye guys. 
 Quick. 
Lock the door so Bridget has to ring the bell. 
Hi. 
 Damn. 
You know, honey, I know today was really rough. 
But but you�re home now, and it�s gonna be okay. 
What are you talking about? 
 Your day at school. 
Ring a bell? 
Rory. 
 It was begging for it. 
Um, Mom, actually everyone was really nice. 
And there�s a dance this weekend. 
So I�m gonna have to get a new dress. 
Oh, honey, I�m really happy that you�re adjusting but, uh, we can�t buy you a new dress for every occasion. 
Oh, hmm, okay, but I don�t know how I�m supposed to torture guys with something I�ve already worn before. 
I do admit it�s possible. 
I�ve done more with less. 
Rory, could you stop doing that? 
Grant you, I�m annoying. 
But I�m not a magician. 
I�ll get it. 
Hey, you fixed the doorbell. 
 I love this guy. 
Kyle, I am so glad you�re here. 
You know, Kerry�s been really down. 
I�m thinking maybe you could take her someplace fun. 
You know, like like an arcade. - Yeah, sure 
of course. - Okay, I�m gonna give you money. 
Ah, Momma H, I will not take your daughter out and make you pay. 
Oh, Kyle, you�re such a gentleman. 
I insist. - No, I insist. - I don�t want to 
hear another word about it. 
Take the money. 
 All right. 
That�s it? 
You want to play air hockey? 
 I don�t know.  Oh, come on. 
When you bend over, sometimes I can see down your shirt. 
Kyle! 
 Okay, yeah, I know. 
Let�s do the dance game. You always 
kick my butt at the dance game. 
Yeah, that�s true. 
She smiles. 
Yeah, okay, I can�t help but laugh. 
You�re a really bad dancer. 
Well, I�m not that bad. 
 No, you really are. 
I love you. 
What? 
 You heard me. 
Ah, there you are, you little devils. 
What are you doing now? 
 I�m installing dimmer switches. 
You�re welcome. 
Uh, so, Dad, how long were you planning on staying? 
You know, just out of curiosity. 
Oh, I see: �Thanks for the dimmer switches, Dad. 
But, don�t let the door hit you on the ass on the way out. - No, no, no, no. 
I�m I�m really glad you�re here and the kids are really glad you�re here. 
You can stay as long as you want. 
It�s just you know, if you wanna help maybe you could help me with something I actually need help with? - Like? 
I don�t know. 
Maybe groceries? 
I�m not too good at groceries. 
I can do them, but I just don�t think it�s a man�s job. 
Okay, how about laundry? 
You�re joking. 
Well, I know, Dad, you know Kerry has been really down. 
Maybe you could talk to her, and try to get to the bottom of things. 
Ahh getting to the bottom of things was always your mother�s area. 
Yeah, and she�s gone and left you. 
Perhaps there�s a connection. 
No, I don�t see it. 
Oh, hi honey, how was the arcade? 
I broke up with Kyle. 
 Oh, no honey. 
What happened? 
 It�s fine. Whatever. 
It just figures How did you know we went to the arcade? 
Well, you must have said that�s where you were going before you left. 
No, I didn�t. 
Well, then, you you know, you said it when you got home. 
No, didn�t say it then either. 
I guessed? 
Oh, my God, that�s why Kyle was suddenly Mister Big Spender. 
You set the whole thing up. 
 Oh, honey, I was just trying to help. 
Well, don�t. 
Don�t help. 
Just leave me and my horrible life alone. 
So, Mom, get this at the coffee shop I was only at number nine on my punch card but I think the coffee guy had a crush on me so he gave me my mochachinno for free which was so sweet, but yeah, like I�m gonna go out with a barrister. 
Honey, a barrister is a lawyer in England. 
 Oh, well, I guess the degree doesn�t translate because he�s only making coffee here. 
Bridget, look, your sister�s upstairs and she�s really upset, so could you just tone the cheeriness down a little. 
Oh, what else is new? 
 What�s that supposed to mean? 
Fruit cup girl thrives on being depressed. - Fruit cup girl? 
Yeah, that�s what the kids were calling her today at school because all she would do was sit alone in the cafeteria picking at this disgusting fruit cup. 
You know, Bridget, you need to cool it. 
If Kerry wants to be sad it�s her choice, it�s unfair that I have to pretend like everything�s terrible when it isn�t. 
Honey, it�s only been two weeks. 
Not everyone is as resilient as you are. 
It is not my fault that Kerry is depressed. 
God, I can�t believe I�m being punished for being happy. 
This place sucks. 
Sorry. 
This place sucks. 
Kerry? Honey? Can we talk? 
 Go away. 
Look, I I was just trying to help. 
Bridge, you in there? 
 Go away. 
Look, honey, I shouldn�t have yelled at you. 
I�m sorry. I really am sorry! 
You already said that. 
 I wasn�t talking to you. 
Good. 
Don�t talk to me. 
You can buy a new dress for the dance. 
 Really? 
�Cause I know exactly which one I�m gonna get. 
It�s a red, which I know is not usually my color, but it really works. 
I don�t think there�s a color out there I can�t make prettier. 
You�re buying her a dress for the dance? 
Well, I didn�t say we�ll see. 
Now you�re going back on your word? 
Unbelievable! 
God, no one says what they mean! 
I�m still getting the dress, right? 
Uh, I guess. Yes. 
 You�re the best. 
Gramps, can I ask you something? 
Shoot. 
 And you won�t tell anyone? 
I don�t really talk to a lot of people. 
Okay, remember that girl, Missy Kleinfeld? 
She�s got this freckly little nose, killer smile, been in a bra since the sixth grade, and really big... 
I got it from �bra in sixth grade. 
Anyway, she�s been offering to help me catch up on the work I missed when I was gone from school. 
And the thing is, I don�t need any help. 
But, I�ve been staring at that bra for a lot of years, and I�m just wondering, am I taking advantage of her? 
Well, you know what I think? 
I got a sneaky suspicion this Missy Kleinfeld is taking advantage of you. 
She is? - Yeah. 
And you know what I say? 
Huh? 
 Let her. 
My key didn�t work in the lock. 
I bet you�re pretty glad I fixed the doorbell. 
What is going on? 
 I changed the locks. 
Now you have just one key to open the front door and the back. 
Wow, actually, Dad, that makes things a lot easier. 
Except Gramps already lost the key. 
 Ah, well it�s no big deal. 
Someone just has to stay home at all times to let the rest of us in. 
My vote is for blabbermouth. 
Hey hey, honey, you okay? 
Oh, do I look down? 
Well, maybe you should hire Kyle to take me somewhere or I know, you could always buy me a new dress. 
You cannot speak to me that way. 
 I�m sorry. 
I guess I should just be all fake and sweet like Bridget and take whatever my little grubby hands can get. 
Kerry! Ugh! 
Okay, so were all gonna go to Jenna�s, before the dance, so we can give each other makeovers. 
Ah, honey, is is that the dress you bought with my credit card? 
Yeah. 
Isn�t it great? 
I mean, you get good boob dresses and good butt dresses and goodleg dresses, but it�s hardly ever you get a good boob butt leg dress. 
Know what I mean? 
 Jiminy Christmas. 
Well, honey, I don�t know, it�s a little Slutty. 
Mom, you said I could get any dress I wanted and this was the dress that I wanted. 
Well, have a good time. 
Thank you. 
What�s wrong? 
I never would have got this far before. 
Dad would�ve never let me go out like this. 
He would have he would have definitely sent me upstairs to change and told me to cover myself up in some hideous sweater and sit me down for an hour lecture on how I should respect myself because guys only want one thing. 
And I always hated it when he did that. 
I just want my dad back. 
 Bridget.  Leave me alone. 
None of my business. 
Would you stop trying to fix things and just help? 
Same to you, baby girl. 
Come here. 
I know. 
Oh we lost your dad, you guys. 
We lost him. 
He�s gone. 
And he�s not coming back. 
But listen, there is no right way to deal with this. 
I was just trying so hard to be happy, you know. 
Because, if I was happy everything would be normal, and nothing�s normal. 
It�s just not working. 
It�s okay. 
And I felt so guilty that something good was happening in my life at the same time that this terrible thing was happening. 
Well, honey, what was happening? 
What what was your good thing? 
Kyle said I I don�t know he was just trying to be sweet. 
What did he say? 
It�s dumb. He said he loved me. 
But, he doesn�t. 
Well, maybe he does. 
No, he�s just feeling sorry for me. 
Listen there is no manual on how to deal with this. 
It�s okay to be happy when you�re happy. 
Honey, it�s okay to be sad when you�re sad. 
God, and now I�m happy because Bridget�s really sad. 
I�m so screwed up. 
Oh, sweetheart, we�re all screwed up. 
The important thing is that we stay together and we support each other. 
I love you guys so much. 
I love you, Mom. 
 I love you, too. 
Bridge? 
 Yeah? 
You�re too pretty for this dress. 
What? 
I just think it�s for some girl who has to try really hard. 
And you don�t. 
You should respect yourself. 
Like Dad was always telling you to. 
Because you deserve the best. 
You deserve the best, too. 
No, I don�t. 
 No, listen. 
What Kyle said to you, he meant it. 
How do you know? 
Kyle and I went out for a really long time. - Yeah? 
He never said it to me. 
Hi. 
 Hi. 
Come here. 
Kyle, why did you say you loved me? 
Well, see, when your dad died. 
 Yeah, that�s what I thought. 
No. - No, you felt sorry for me. 
Never mind. 
No, that�s not it. It�s just, when your dad 
died, it it made me realize that you have to say the things that you feel because you might not get another chance. 
Oh. 
Anything you feel like you want to say back? 
I�ll get back to you. 
Hey, honey. - You sure you don�t want 
to go to the dance? - Yeah, I�m sure. 
I think I�m just gonna go upstairs and change. 
Okay. 
You know, Dad, you keep working at this pace, you�re gonna run out of things to do around here. 
Not likely. 
Okay, I�m listening. 
What? - Listening. 
It�s a form of helping. 
At night, it�s the worst. 
I hear ambulances or a noise and I jump up out of the bed with this scared, panicky feeling. 
Only, I I don�t know what I�m scared for because what I�m scared of already happened. 
I still feel like he�s gonna walk through that door. 
Okay and then you carry that and divide the whole thing by X. 
Wow, Missy, that is some really tough stuff. 
Maybe you could show me how to do it one more time. - Yeah, sure. 
See, when you solve the equation all the variables come together and you wanna make sure it�s on one step. 
Lois and I still can't believe it. 
Oh, well you tell Lois thank you for the casserole. 
It's so sweet, but you know, I have been back to work for a month and I can cook. 
Take care of each other. 
 Will do. 
You and Paul have such good friends. 
He sure was loved. - Yeah. 
Anyone else getting sick of it? 
Honey, they're just trying to show they care. 
By bringing casseroles? 
Everyone knows they're all carbs. 
Is it impossible to say 'we're here for you' with a salad? 
And the worst part is the way the 'casserole people' say hi. 
Yeah, I know. 
 It's... "Hii" 
Look I don't think anybody means offense by saying 'Hi. - Right. 
That's what friends do. And if they 
want to bring delicious things, we'll just have to grin and eat it. 
Hey. 
 Hey. 
You know, a lot of times, people take orange balls similar to this one outside and shoot them at basketball hoops. 
Okay, but bring it back. 
Hey, aren't basketball tryouts in a few days? 
Wednesday, I think. I don't know if 
I'm going to do that anymore. 
Rory, you were so excited about basketball. 
That's all you and Dad talked about. 
Yeah, well, things change. 
You know, your Dad wouldn't want something you and he shared to suddenly become meaningless for you. 
 But it's not the same. 
He taught me how to do a lay-up. 
He was helping me practice. 
And, besides, they're only picking fourteen players. 
You know, maybe your grandfather could help you. 
He was quite the basketball player in his day. - Really? 
Which one of the thirteen colonies did he play for? - Hey! 
Just think about it? 
Your dad really would have wanted that. 
What's that? - I'm putting together a 
collage for the scholarship kickoff dinner. 
The one the newspaper set up in Dad's honor? 
The one you bought the new outfit for? - Right. Thursday. 
Mom, we got more cards. 
 More? 
Well, just put them on the desk. 
I'll go through them later. 
I gotta get to these dirty casserole dishes. 
Cate, don't bother yourself with those. 
I'm in the process of washing them. 
And I'm just letting them soak. 
 Dad, no offense, but... 
you've been soaking them for two days. 
How long does this process take? 
 How would I know? 
What are you doing? - I need 
the scissors. - Well, I was using them. 
Well, I have a stray bang hair. - Everyone 
in the world stop what you're doing. 
Bridget has a stray bang hair. 
 Girls... 
God, give them back! - I'm using them! 
 They're my art scissors! 
Why are you so selfish? - My hair is art. 
 They're actually not even mine. 
They're one of my friend's. - I'm sure, some 
art dork who's thrilled I'm using them. 
I said enough! For 
the love of God, stop! 
This endless bickering is driving me nuts. - Oh, no. 
Poor Mom. - Yeah, now I think we 
upset her. - Yes. I think you did. 
Girls, don't you think your Mom has enough to deal with right now without you girls fighting. 
So, what do ya say, we help her out? - Okay. - Alright? 
Now, there's still a lot of cheese caked on those dishes, so don't be afraid to put your shoulders into it. Okay? 
I'll be right outside. 
Hey, what do you say we work on your endurance after you're done? 
You want me to walk up with you to the store to get cigarettes, don't you? 
Well, nahi... yeah. 
Looking pretty good, pal. 
 Not good enough. 
Dad always said games are won and lost on free throws. - Smart man, your dad. 
Did you know his team won the state championship two years in a row? 
Well, back when I was playing ball with Ben Franklin and the boys... 
Mom told you what I said? 
 Just give me the ball. 
That's pretty funny. I've got 
a friend who can kick it in. 
Hey, that's a real shot. 
It improves your odds of making a free throw when you shoot from between your legs. 
I think it'd also improve my odds of getting beat up after tryouts. 
Hey, guys. - Cate, would you tell your 
son it doesn't make any difference what other people think about the way he shoots the ball? 
Well, I don't know, Dad. I mean 
then people in the stands would know the kid doing the 'granny shot' was my son. I don't need that. 
Well, then fine. 
You know what I need? 
I am not taking you to the store for cigarettes. - Oh, crap. 
...our cameras followed Jan as she went 
in search of her 'Extreme Makeover!' 
Here's what the doctors did. Her nasal 
bridge was shaved and sculpted. 
Her teeth capped. Eyelids 
lifted. Fat is lyposuctioned from 
tummy, buttocks, and thigh sections. But in the end, 
will the surgeons achieve the look Jan's striving for? 
This was Jan before. 
This is Jan after her Extreme Makeover. 
Jan! You're pretty now! Oh my... 
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, God. 
No, no, no. 
Not pretty! 
Hey. - 'Sup? - Have you seen my 
collage? I wanna go put it away. 
Yes. I have seen your collage actually. 
Kerry, the truth is I took it to be framed. 
What? - Yeah. I just 
thought it was so beautiful and that it would look more beautiful in a frame. 
Bridge, I love this not-fighting thing. 
 Oh, cling to that. 
I heard the door. 
I thought maybe it was Rory back from basketball tryouts. - No. 
Just me, back from my walk. 
 With your laundry? 
If your neighbors want to help us through these difficult times, I say we let them. 
You know, Dad, I think we might have finally found a use for you. 
Well, you sound like you're in a good mood. 
Yeah, well I got Rory to go to his basketball tryouts. 
So, yeah, I feel pretty good. 
I sure hope he makes the team. 
Okay, now not so good. 
Why wouldn't he make the team? 
Well, I didn't say he wouldn't. 
Miracles happen. 
How bad is he? - No, no. He's 
not bad. He's got a lot of heart. 
Oh no, not 'a lot of heart!' 
What was I thinking making him go try out? 
Hi. Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
I made the team! 
 Told you he would! 
Hey, Beach. 
 Hey! 
Mom, do you have any pictures of Dad? 
Of course, honey. 
Whatever you want. 
Okay, good. I need like, twenty-five, 
from various stages of his life. 
For my wallet. 
 What are you up to? 
Nothing. Why are you 
so suspicious? God. 
Rory, I told you not to bounce the ball in the house. 
Hi, Mom, blonde sister. 
Rory, you ruined Kerry's collage! 
But the ball landed over and it's all wet and there's cheese on it... 
Shut up. Be a man, own up to it. 
You're going to have to talk to Kerry. 
 What's everyone doing in there? 
Bridget, actually, I think you're the one who needs to talk to Kerry. 
Come on, we're going. 
Let's go, Rory. - I'll catch up. 
No, come on, let's go. 
Talk to me about what? 
 Nothing.  Oh, okay. 
Did you happen to get my collage back from the frame store? 
Yeah... you know how we're 
not fighting any more? 
Such a good thing. 
 Oh my God. What happened to it? 
You're going to laugh. 
See, I was cleaning this pan and this amazing show came on TV. I mean, 
they made this ugly, fat woman hot. 
It's like, with the miracles in plastic surgery today, there's just no excuse to be ugly. 
Can I see it? - I didn't put 
a tape in the VCR. Sorry. 
My collage. 
 You know, Rory is not totally blameless in this. 
You're taking this really well. 
Because we decided not to fight anymore. 
Look at all these pictures of Dad. - I know. 
You know what would have gone great here? Your collage. 
Look at all this stuff, mom. 
 It looks like the Hall of Fame. 
Well, we're all gonna have a nice time. 
We're all gonna have fun. - Cate! 
 Oh, God.  Still having fun, Mom? 
Hi, Tommy. 
 Hey, some turn out, huh? 
Everybody loved Paul. 
Except that guy. 
Tommy, I need your help. Who is this 
woman that keeps waving at me? 
Come on, you've met her a number of times. She's been here forever. 
Well, what's her name? - 'Boobs', from 
reception. - Thank you, Tommy. - De nada. 
Cate! 
 You! 
Are you all okay? 
Oh, yeah, we're... we're fine. 
I'm not doing so hot. 
So, on behalf of my husband, I really want to say thank you to all of you here at the Detroit Post. 
It would have warmed his heart establishing a scholarship for high school seniors to pursue a degree in journalism at the college of their choice. 
Sorry, Paul, that includes Ohio State. 
Anyway, thank you. Thank 
you so much. - Yeah! 
Lucky me. I have to 
follow the widow. 
I first met Paul Hennessy when we were sports writers here together. 
And, he was a sports nut. 
And he would have been proud today. 
Because Cate just informed me before, that his little guy, Rory there, just made the school basketball team. 
You told him?! And now 
he told everybody here? 
Well, Rory, your father would have wanted... 
Is there anything Dad wouldn't have wanted? 
No, let him go. 
Curtis, this is Rory's Mom. 
Have you seen him tonight? 
Well, if you do, would you have him call me? Thanks. 
You had to say let him go? 
 Well, I thought he'd be right back. 
Yeah, I know. Why do you think 
he just ran out like that? 
Well, maybe the event got to him. He was pretty emotional. 
I know I needed my share of hugs. 
You know what, I'm going to call his basketball coach. 
Maybe he's hanging out with some of those kids. 
The coach will have a roster. 
Hi, is Coach Rooney there? 
Sure, I'll hold on. 
Maybe that's him. 
Hi - Hi, Helen. 
 I hope I'm not troubling you. 
I just wanted to stop by and see how you folks are doing? 
How am I doing? My son's 
missing, my husband's dead, I have a freezer full of casseroles. You? 
You're gonna want to put this on three-fifty for 45 minutes. - Thanks. 
What? - They mean well, honey. 
 Yeah, I know they mean well! 
But I'm starting to feel like I'm in some kind of circus and the price of admission is a casserole! 
Step right up, see the grieving widow! - Oh, Cate... 
Yeah, every time I start to feel like I'm okay, someone reminds me that I lost my husband. 
It's like getting punched in the stomach. 
You're entitled to feel that way. But, honey... 
they're entitled to miss Paul, too. 
You gotta give them that. 
It's your fault you married a man who's so well liked. 
Okay, would you just yell at me for ruining your collage? 
I can't take this tension anymore. 
 What tension?  Okay, that's it. 
Kerry, I just cannot live with myself so... 
What are you doing?! Stop! 
There. I ruined your collage and 
now I ruined my favorite top. 
God, we're even. 
I can finally breathe. 
That was my top. - What are you 
talking about? I wear it all the time. 
Because you borrowed it and you didn't give it back. 
Oh, yeah. 
Then yell at me for that. 
Look, we're not fighting anymore. 
Remember, for Mom? 
Besides, it was an accident. 
And I know you felt really, really bad. 
Yeah, I did feel really bad... 
except for the little part of me that didn't. 
You have my attention. 
It's just that when it happened, Kerry, I was kinda... glad. 
Go on. 
All I know is when I saw your collage I was so totally impressed. 
And so totally jealous. 
Jealous? - Totally. 
Kerry, you and Dad had so much in common. 
I mean, he was a writer, you're an artist. 
You had this special connection, because you guys were so much alike and we just weren't. 
You idiot! Are you blind? 
Okay, now you're yelling at me. 
 Yeah, because I'm mad! 
Good! Finally. Go with that. 
 You and Dad had a special connection. 
You know how wherever he went he would light up the whole room... 
you totally do that! 
And when people meet you they instantly like you and they want to be friends with you. 
Just like they did with him. 
How can you not see that? 
Are you that stupid? 
I know this is supposed to be a pep talk, so, could you like, stop calling me stupid. 
Well, you are. 
 Well, it takes one to know one. 
Have you heard a word I've said? 
 Yes, I heard you! 
I'm like Dad! That was sweet! 
Thank you! - You're welcome! 
And thank you for goading me into fighting with you when I'm trying to be a better person, but obviously I'm not. 
Obviously. But I'm glad 
we cleared the air. 
Sisters are supposed to fight. 
You know the most important thing we learned from this? 
Right. Dad would want us to 
express our true feelings. 
No. I got you to get mad when you said 
you weren't. So I win. I always win. 
I called everywhere. 
Where have you been? 
Rory, don't pull stunts like that. 
I was so worried. 
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have run out of there. I just... 
I think I know why. 
 You do? 
I spoke to Coach Rooney. 
 Oh, no. 
He told you I didn't make the team. 
How come you didn't tell me? 
 I don't know. 
I kept hearing from you it's what Dad would have wanted. 
I was embarrassed. - Did I put 
that kind of pressure on you? 
No, no, no... Well, yeah. 
Look, what your dad would have wanted was for you to have fun and be happy like any other fourteen year-old kid. 
Oh, great, now I have to have fun and be happy. I don't feel happy right now. 
Okay, I'm gonna stop saying what dad would have wanted. 
 Thanks. 
Rory, Coach Rooney told me something else. - What? 
Well, he said that since you were cut, that you've shown up every day and asked to work out with the team because you wanted to get better. - So? 
So, he said you showed him something. 
As of now, you are on the team. 
 I am? Alright! 
Yeah, I know, he said that you showed him a lot of... 
you know, a lot of... 
 God, not 'a lot of heart. 
That's like when a girl tells you she likes you as a friend. - No, no. 
No, honey, it was 'stick-to-it-iveness. 
Perseverance. - Heart. - Yes. 
Oh, who cares, you made the team. 
 But, it's not the same. 
Dad was such a great athlete on all these teams. 
I want to be more than a guy that has 'a lot of heart. 
I want to be good at something. 
Oh, honey, yeah, your Dad played on a lot of teams in high school. 
Some great teams. 
I know. He told 
me a thousand times. 
Let me show you something. Come here. 
You see this? 
 Yeah, that's a team picture after they won the state championship. 
 Alright, now look closely. 
You see how all these guys over here are all sweaty and their hair's messed up? 
Okay, now there's your dad. 
Not a hair out of place. 
Dry as a bone. 
I don't know how to tell you this, honey, but your father also played with a lot of heart. 
He was on the bench? 
 Well, not always. 
There was the occasional blow out, you know, garbage time. 
Look, your dad loved sports. 
Because of that love, he became a sports writer. 
And he was really, really good at it. 
And what your dad would have want... 
what I want is for you to find something that you have passion for. 
I think I want to sit on the bench with the rest of the guys on the team. Just like Dad. 
And then maybe when I'm out of school I can pursue my passion. 
And what's that? 
 I have some ideas. 
That kid's got a lot of heart.
