1 "666 Park Avenue"... 
Nice digs. 
We have an interview. 
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen. 
For the manager position. 
Welcome. 
Mr. Doran likes to approve 
every tenant himself. 
Obviously, whatever you guys said won him over. 
She's how we get Henry. 
What happened to the previous manager? 
Why would anybody ever want to leave this? 
I'm Louise. 
I think you met my husband Brian. 
Kind of nerdy cute. 
Hey, honey, come meet my new assistant. 
Brian, this is Alexis. 
Can you believe it? 
She lives right across the street, actually. 
Washer number three is leaking. 
Anything else I should know? 
Well, there's a thief in the building. 
I'll keep an eye out. 
I like your necklace. 
It's not right what you do. 
What I do is fulfill needs. 
Oh! 
Oh, my God. Aah! 
You signed a binding contract. 
Now it's time to settle up. 
Aah! 
 bom, bom, bom, bom   see the pyramids along the nile   bom, bom, bom, bom   Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle   bom, bom, bom, bom   just remember, darlin'   all the while   you belong to me   bom, bom, bom, bom   see the marketplace in old algiers   bom, bom, bom, bom   send me photographs and souvenirs   bom, bom, bom, bom   Just remember when a dream appears   you   belong   to me  Wait. I-I don't understand. 
Barlow used to live here, now he doesn't. 
It's not that complicated. 
No, I mean, why didn't he tell me he was moving out? 
Well, you've been here, like, a week. 
Why would he tell you anything? 
Because I'm the new manager. 
I'm supposed to get told. 
And besides, people don't just up and move like that. 
I mean, there's paperwork to fill out, I-I-I think. 
Mr. Doran took care 
of the paperwork. 
He and Barlow, they got close after the guy's wife took her high dive off bellevue. 
This right here, this is just a... 
it's a favor for him, all right? 
Sure. Great. 
Where's all this being shipped? 
Vegas. 
Help me, uh, count the boxes. 
Sure. 
What'd you get? 
Uh, 23. 
Me, too. 
I got a lot of work to do on this place. 
Gotta resurface the floors, redo the kitchen... 
Install new fixtures, and we should really look at some of those sconces as w... 
yeah. 
Now? 
Sconces. 
All right. I'll be down 
in a minute. 
The, uh, party planner and her entourage have arrived. 
It's gonna be quite the soiree tonight at the Dorans. 
I'm looking forward to it. 
Hmm. 
Oh, sorry, Tony. 
You weren't invited? 
Oh, no, actually, I, uh, I got a prior engagement. 
Oh. Yeah. 
Right. Yeah. 
Of course. 
All right. Take it easy. 
Aah! Aah! 
Hey. 
Tony, Barlow's apartment, there are birds in the walls. 
Uh, it's an old building. 
Probably lots of things in the walls. 
They flew right out of the wall and broke through a window upstairs. 
We gotta call an exterminator. 
This is serious. 
Yeah, yeah, look, look, I got one elevator down, and it's making my life miserable. 
I need it fixed today. 
Yeah, yeah, it's the one that almost ate that lady. 
Yeah, that one. All right. 
I sent Louise flowers from all of us, by the way. 
Of course you did. 
This is the exterminator we use. 
You're the resident manager, you call. 
Thanks, Tony. 
I'll take care of it. 
You know, Tony, uh, by the way, I didn't take the job from you, okay? 
Mr. Doran hired us. 
Oh, I know that, Jane. 
Thanks. 
Oh, Nona, hey. 
What's up? 
You mentioned that there's a thief in the building. 
I... well, it looks like 
I'm the latest victim. 
Oh, no. 
Yeah, uh, my... 
my grandmother's necklace. 
It's irreplaceable. 
I'll keep an eye out. 
Thanks. 
Hey, Jane. 
Don't mess with the birds. 
They're part of the Drake. 
Hey. Just talked 
to the doctor a... 
here. What are you doing? 
Let me help. 
All right. Let me help. 
I'm not an invalid, Brian. 
No, but you're still on the mend. 
Mending is really boring. 
You gotta stop complaining. 
You know, the doctor thinks that you only have to be here a few more nights. 
What? 
That is not a long time for a girl that got crushed by an elevator. 
And... 
Honestly, babe, uh, a collapsed lung and a concussion are really serious. 
So are some of the bills we have. 
I can't get out there and land a job until I get out of here. 
You still have that one gig. 
Actually, they said they weren't gonna hire me again. 
That's ridiculous, Lou. 
You were in an accident. 
Oh, they know. They sent those. 
Look, they're vindictive fashionistas who were inconvenienced. 
Yeah, it sucks. 
Actually, will you get the nurse? 
My Vicodin's wearing off. 
Yeah, sure. 
I'm back. 
Alexis, thank God. 
Oh, thank you. 
Now this is how you save a life. 
How are you? 
Uh, I'm fine. 
Is that stuff from our apartment? 
Almost forgot. 
Here you go. Here's your key. 
I'm late. 
I know. I'm sorry. 
Whoa. 
Wow. You look stunning. 
Hey, thanks for getting the wine. 
Of course, of course. 
So you wouldn't believe this guy in the wine shop. 
He was trying to push an $800 bottle of wine on me. 
Have you ever heard of Chateau Monique? No. 
Yeah, well, he couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it either. 
But you'll be happy to know, I held firm on a bottle of Merlot for 20 bucks. 
That's what the Dorans use in their salad dressing. 
I'm gonna hop in the shower. 
I'm funny. 
How was your day? 
What, you didn't get my text? 
The one about you being attacked by birds? 
That wasn't an autocorrect mistake? 
No. I got, like, 
tippi hedren attacked. 
They flew right out of the wall of an apartment upstairs. 
It was crazy. 
And I still can't figure out where they came from. 
Did you provoke 'em? 
No, I didn't provoke them. 
I know how you are, Jane. 
Get in the shower. 
I love you. 
Mwah. 
Jane, Henry, there you are. 
I'm sorry we're late. 
It's my fault. 
Oh, Olivia, this is amazing. 
Here. Uh, for you and Gavin. 
Oh, how thoughtful. 
Help yourself to a drink. 
The bar is straight ahead. 
Uh, Adriana. E-excuse me. 
I love your dress. 
Uh, what do you want to drink? 
Uh, something with vodka, please. 
Okay. 
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle. 
She lives in the building. Hey. 
Hi. Nice to meet you. 
Hi. The Sushi's excellent, 
by the way. 
Oh, yeah? 
I was just telling your lovely wife... 
oh. 
Um... 
Not your wife? 
Yes, lovely. 
Uh, no, not married. 
Oh, well, not yet. 
I can tell Henry is a keeper. 
Well, I like to think so. 
Thank you, darling. 
Thank you. 
Go on in, take a look. 
32 stories tall, just off the West Side highway at 43rd street... 
condos and office space. 
Looks impressive. It will be. 
It's just a steel frame now. 
These guys are in some kind of financing squeeze. 
They're desperate to get out. 
The Alpern development group. 
You probably heard about it. 
Alpern, yeah, it sounds familiar. 
I'm picking this project up for a song... 
lands, construction costs, air rights... all of it. 
Uh, if... if you don't mind 
me asking, what's a song go for these days? 
$100 million. 
That stays between us. 
Uh, yeah, of course. 
Hey. There you are. 
I was just inside talking to Gavin. 
Whew. 
Mm-hmm. 
Wow. 
Yeah. 
Can you believe this view? 
I could get used to it. 
Hmm. 
Well, enjoy it while you can. 
We turn back into pumpkins at midnight. 
You've met our new building managers? 
Oh, hi, Gavin. 
You caught me staring. 
Yes, they're very nice. 
Mm. 
You here with someone? 
Like a date? No. 
I find that hard to believe. 
It's not for lack of trying. 
Mm. 
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it." 
Someone said that to me once. 
They never tried Internet dating. 
Mm. Actually, I'm going out 
with someone tomorrow night. 
Magic could happen... 
In theory. 
There's a restaurant in the flatiron district that's very romantic. 
I'll call the maitre d'. 
He'll take care of you and your gentleman. 
That's nice, Gavin. 
Thanks. 
Never hurts to stack the deck. 
Henry. 
Hmm? 
I think I left the clothes in the dryer. 
Why not tomorrow? 
Because there's a thief in the building. 
Hello? 
 are the stars out   shoo-bop, shoo-bop   tonight?  
 doo-wop, shoo-bop   I don't know if it's cloudy or bright   doo-wop, shoo-bop   I only have eyes   for you   dear   doo-wop, shoo-bop   the moon may   doo-wop, shoo-bop   be high   doo-wop, shoo-bop   but I can't see a thing   doo-wop, shoo-bop   in the sky   I only have eyes  Oh, my God. 
I got 15 minutes to get downtown. 
Have you seen my black socks anywhere, babe? 
Yeah, did you check the, uh, laundry basket? 
Um, I... did I? Of course. 
You know, I'm thinking red is a really nice contrast with the green skin tone you have going on this morning. 
Yeah, well, for the record, I feel much worse on the inside. 
Mm. 
All right. I love you. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I forgot to mention, I, uh, kind of invited the Dorans to dinner tomorrow night. 
I'm sorry. You kind of what? 
Look, Jane, it's not like we can afford to take 'em out. 
And you're an amazing cook, Jane. 
Oh, Henry, I have to cook for billionaires? 
Fine. If you want me 
to cancel, I will. 
I'll just tell 'em I was drunk. 
You so totally owe me. 
I so totally owe you. 
I hate to, but I'm gonna late. 
You're the best. 
One elevator is still down. 
We're just waiting on final inspection. 
Well, use the freight elevator if you're in a hurry. 
Yeah. All right. 
Have a good day. 
15 calls, same question. 
Hey, Tony, uh, you ever hear about a murder that happened at the Drake? 
A murder? Um... Uh, no, no. 
There's been a few suicides over the years, and a bunch of... 
bunch of accidents. 
You know, one guy... 
one guy actually fell out his own window. 
Idiot. 
But, uh... But no murders 
that I can recollect, no. 
Oh. 
Why do you want to know about a murder? 
J-just wondering. 
You're kind of creepy, aren't you? 
What? No. 
Yeah, you are. I can tell. 
Your guy's here. 
I'm the exterminator. 
No kidding. 
Want to take a look? 
It's an old ventilation shaft. 
Wow. 
It's not on any of the drawings I have. 
This kind of brick here... 
part of the original construction. 
Look down. 
Oh, my God. 
There's hundreds of them. 
Starlings. 
Biggest nesting murmuration I've ever seen in a building. 
What? 
Murmuration. 
It's what you call starlings. 
Collectively, I mean. 
You know, like, uh, a gaggle of geese, a kit of pigeons, a murder of crows. 
There's lots of names for birds. 
My personal favorite... 
an exaltation of larks. 
That should keep 'em in the hole. 
So, uh, what do you think? 
Can you get rid of 'em? 
Shouldn't be a problem. 
I'll kill 'em all. 
Jane, hey. 
Brian, hey, uh, we're having a small ventilation issue in the building. 
Uh, we're checking apartments on every floor. Can we... 
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. 
Great. Do what you gotta do. 
There's a couple of birds stuck in an air shaft. 
It's nothing. 
Oh. 
You good? Mm-hmm. 
Okay. 
So, uh, so how's Louise feeling? 
Uh, bored to death. 
You know, but other than that, better. 
Good. I'm gonna visit tomorrow. 
She'd love the company. 
You know, Brian, your apartment is... is so cool. 
I love the photographs. 
Yeah, that's all Lou. 
She's got the style. 
My contribution is the, uh, messy area... there. 
So how's the play coming? 
I-I thought I closed those curtains. 
Mm. Yeah, lots of, uh, 
lots of distractions, huh? 
Uh, I-I, uh, I keep them closed when I... when I write. 
Looks good here. 
Wall's solid. 
Okay. Uh, Brian, 
thanks for everything. 
Sure. 
Okay. 
All right. Uh, see you around. 
Oh. 
If they ventilated down this far, the air shaft should be behind this wall. 
Yeah, except there's no way to access it. 
There is. 
Someone covered up a door right here. 
A door? 
Hey, you ever consider, whoever covered this door with concrete might have had a good reason to do it? 
There could be a lot of reasons. 
I still want you to demo that wall. 
Let me grab my tools. 
 play me   Baby, don't stop now   we're taken in this far  Excuse me. Check, please. 
 Love is like music, a magical union   that trills and moves   let's lose our restrain  Let me buy you a consolation drink. 
You were right. It's... 
it's very romantic here. 
It's not a good place to sit alone. 
Alone seems to be a running theme in my life lately. 
I'm having a drink with a friend. Come and join us. 
I'm gonna go home. 
Well... he was hoping 
to meet you. 
One drink. 
One drink. 
Hi there. Frank Alpern. 
Danielle. 
Pleasure to meet you. You too. 
Join us for a drink? 
Sure. 
You gonna kill the birds? 
Jeez.  You scared me. 
You shouldn't be doing that. 
Uh... 
I'm just helping 'em find a new home. 
You're gonna make them upset. 
You know, uh, I don't usually work with an audience. 
Whatever. 
Oh, my God. 
Thank you so much for getting me lunch. 
You're welcome. 
Uh, so you're, uh, you're feeling better? 
Better. Honestly, 
it could've been so much worse. 
I mean, if Brian hadn't been there... 
I-I know. 
I mean, you're lucky, I guess. 
They ever figure out what happened? 
Uh, well, we had the elevators inspected yesterday. 
Um... but they couldn't 
find anything wrong. 
All the safety mechanisms seem to be working. 
So what does that mean? 
Clearly, there's an issue. 
I-I'm gonna talk to Gavin about it. 
That thing was possessed. 
I swear, it felt like it was trying to kill me. 
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane. 
It's gonna happen. 
What's this? A... a lawyer? 
He's a personal injury attorney. 
He thinks I have a real case. 
You're gonna sue Gavin? 
I'm strongly considering it. 
I'm missing out on work. 
I've... I've lost a lot of money 
because of this accident. 
I don't know. 
We have some serious bills. 
I-I'm sorry, Louise. 
I-I probably shouldn't get in the middle of this. Uh... 
Right. 
Anyway, I should probably go. 
Um, I gotta go to the grocery store then home to cook dinner, so... 
Oh, just you and Henry tonight, huh? 
Yeah. Yeah, just me and, uh, 
me and Henry. 
Sweet. 
Oh! 
God, I'm sorry. 
Oops. 
Where are you guys off to all dressed up? 
Oh, someone has a big night out. 
It's an excuse to go shopping. 
I kind of met someone last night. 
Well, that's great. 
I'll let you know what happens. 
When you see what she's gonna be wearing, I'll tell you what's gonna happen. 
Fingers crossed. 
Nona? 
"1956." 
What the hell? 
"The victim, Edward Paxton, "a longtime resident of the Drake, "was found murdered in his home. 
The killer remains at large." 
Hey, babe. 
Hey, the Dorans are gonna be here any minute. 
Uh, start chopping. 
Did you get my text? 
Um, yes. 
So, yeah, what, you... you had a dream 
someone was murdered at the Drake, and it came true? 
No. Well, yes. 
Okay, I-I found an article about a guy who was killed here in 1956. 
And it turns out it was the same guy that was in my dream. 
But I had the dream before I read about it. 
Explain that to me. 
Memory is unreliable, and our brain mixes things up all the time. 
Nope, not mine and not about that. 
Okay, so you're clairvoyant. 
So answer me this... 
am I getting fired? 
Okay, what? 
I shouldn't even be telling you this. 
It... it sounds like you should 
be telling me this. 
Okay, so the other night when we were at the Dorans, Gavin showed me this building that he's buying. 
It's $100 million. 
Oh, my God. They're gonna hate 
my pot roast. 
Babe, focus. 
Sorry. What? 
Okay, so I found out at work that the building sits right next to an old industrial lot. 
It turns out that lot has soil levels of arsenic and chromium that are off the charts. 
What does that mean? 
What it... it means, 
it's a toxic wasteland. 
So if Gavin closes the deal with the, um... 
Oh, with the... 
with the Alpern group, I mean, he's screwed. 
Like he's $100-million screwed. 
Well, then you gotta tell him, Henry. 
Yeah, babe, I have to tell him, and then the leak gets traced back to me, and I'm done, and we're back in Indiana. 
Okay, what are you gonna do? 
I-I don't know. 
I'm gonna pretend I know nothing about what I know for the next two hours, and then quietly freak out after they leave. 
Maybe inviting them over wasn't such a good idea. 
Hi. 
Hi, Gavin. 
Hi. Welcome. Come on in. 
Please. 
Come on in. 
Make yourself at home. 
Something smells delicious. 
Mwah. Mm. 
For you. 
Oh, Gavin, thank you so much. 
Henry. 
Chateau Monique. 
Mm-hmm. 
Our favorite. 
What the hell are you looking at? 
Oh, knock it off. Damn it! 
Ah! 
Aah! 
Get off me. 
Oh. 
Oh! What the hell 
are you doing? 
Get outta here. 
You closed the curtains. 
I wanted to see you. 
How did you get in here? 
You know how. 
Made a key. 
You've been watching me from your window. 
I know you want me. 
You need to leave. 
Right now. 
Really? 
Yeah. I want you to leave. 
Jane, you are an amazing cook. 
Mm. 
Oh, thank you. 
I know pot roast screams '50s housewife, but I've never had a complaint. 
There's nothing wrong with being a little old-fashioned. 
This is delicious. 
Mm. You should tell them 
who taught you how to cook. 
Would I know the chef? 
Probably not. 
Uh, it was my grandmother. 
Uh, I always helped her cook Sunday night dinner growing up. 
Uh, she was convinced that cooking a proper roast would help me find a proper husband, so... 
You want to talk about old-fashioned... 
Well, it would've worked on me. 
Speaking of husbands, what are your plans together? 
Well, uh, sure. 
E-eventually. Right? 
How long have you two been together? 
Mm. What is it... Uh... 
Like four... 
uh, almost five years. 
Yeah, five years. 
You know, it's something we've... we've talked about, 
but we're... 
Not in any rush. 
Oh, I wouldn't wait too long. 
Men like Henry get snatched up pretty quickly in this city. 
It's a jungle out there. 
No, that's not true. Come on. 
I'm serious. He was jealous. 
He did not just keep forgetting to bring my drink. 
Jealous and passive-aggressive? 
Well... 
maybe he was just a bad waiter. 
Nah. I saw the way 
he was looking at you. 
Oh, really? 
Mm-hmm. 
Mm. Well... 
What way was that? 
Kind of like I am right now. 
So what happens now? 
Do you want me? 
Tell me. 
I want you. 
So Jane discovered an interesting bit of history today about the Drake. 
Is that right? 
Yeah, apparently, there was a... murder 
in the building back in, uh, 1956. 
Did you know about this? 
Well, I'm old, but I'm not that old. 
That was long before my time at the Drake. 
Uh, the victim was a man named Edward Paxton. 
They never caught his killer. 
Sounds terrible. 
Where did you get this paper? 
This looks like an original copy. 
Oh, uh, at the... the library. 
Oh. Fascinating. 
I love a murder mystery. 
It happened at the Drake. 
Where exactly? 
Uh, apartment 7g. 
Who's in that apartment, honey? 
Our friend Danielle Tyler. 
Oh. 
Mm. 
Mm. 
Henry. 
Hmm? 
Sometimes, like... 
With the birds in the walls and... 
That door I keep seeing... 
I know it sounds crazy, but... 
I feel like the building's trying to tell me something. 
I don't know what it is yet. 
Wait. I hear it. 
It's saying good night. 
Good night. 
What are you doing? 
Where are you going? 
I gotta get home. 
Please stay with me tonight. 
Don't. I thought we were both 
gonna be adults here. 
What does that mean? 
It means, my wife is gonna kill me if I don't get home tonight. 
Come on. 
Don't look at me like that. 
You knew what the deal was. 
I never took off my wedding ring. 
You didn't have one. 
I looked. 
I did. 
I know I did. 
Right. 
Look... 
I gotta go. 
No. 
Frank. 
 my love must be a kind   of blind love   I can't see anyone   but you   shoo-bop, shoo-bop   doo-wop, shoo-bop  Eddie? 
I loved you so much. 
Aah! 
Oh! 
Gavin. 
Please help me. 
I don't... I don't know 
what happened. 
Looks to me like Frank Alpern got what he deserved. 
What? 
He was a cheat. 
Tried to screw me over in a deal that he knew was bad. 
Oh. 
And what he did to you, leading you on like that... 
I don't blame you for getting upset. 
On the contrary. 
I was counting on it. 
But I-I didn't kill Frank. 
It's the price we pay for the thing we want the most. 
I didn't kill him. 
Do you remember Edward, your first love? 
Told you he was in love with another woman. 
He broke your heart. 
Oh. 
And Carlos... 
Who betrayed you the same way? 
No, oh, it's not... 
And Michael... 
Oh, no. 
Who used you? 
And Dominick? 
No, it... 
And all the others... 
No, no. Through the years? 
No. It's not true. 
It's not true. 
Oh, come. 
Shh. 
Shh. 
I'll take care of the mess. 
And when you wake up in the morning, I promise you, you'll feel like a brand-new woman. 
Mr. Doran. 
Morning, Gavin. 
Good morning. 
I thought you would be interested to know that we closed the deal with the Alpern group late last night. 
Congratulations. 
Although I can't imagine anyone wanting to live there given how toxic the lot next door is. 
But you already knew that, didn't you? 
Look, Gavin, I c... 
I couldn't say anything. 
I wanted to, but, uh... 
you did the right thing. 
You're not upset? 
That you didn't abuse your position to curry favor with me? 
The world is full of temptations, Henry. 
People with integrity are rare. 
Well, I'm still sorry, for what it's worth. 
No hard feelings. 
I flipped the property this morning to a Chinese investor before the news broke. 
I cleared $20 million. 
You had an ace up your sleeve? 
I always do. 
All right. Well, I, uh, 
I better get to work. 
Enjoy the day. 
It's gonna be a hot one. 
Guess you were right. 
I knew he wouldn't bite. 
He's a stand-up kid. 
So he passed your little test. 
Mm-hmm. He's perfect. 
He's a boy scout, Gavin. 
No, no. 
He is going to be a hero. 
Mm. Bye. 
Oh, you're gonna end up putting me in the hospital, Lou. 
I'm not getting back on that elevator. 
Brian, why are all the curtains drawn? 
It's like a cave in here. 
No, let me help you. 
I don't want you to strain yourself. 
Is there mail? 
Yeah. 
Oh. Wow. All this? 
I was only gone a few days. 
Bills, bills, more bills. 
What's this? 
Hmm? 
Who's it from? 
It's from, uh, Gavin Doran. 
An apology. Guess he knows 
I'm gonna sue his ass. 
Honey. 
Hmm? 
Gavin just gave us $300,000. 
I'm feeling better already. 
That's great. 
His supervisor suggests we look for him at the bottom of whiskey bottle. 
Great. That's helpful. 
Yeah. I'll find you 
another exterminator. 
Thank you. 
That's not necessary, Tony. 
Those birds never bothered anyone before. 
Have the wall in Barlow's apartment closed up. 
Just leave them alone? 
They've probably been nesting there for 50 years. 
The Drake is their home, too. 
Oh, well, then, I'll, uh, I'll take it off my list. 
I-I should probably get back to work, though. 
But thanks, Gavin. 
Mm. 
And, Jane, you might want to take care of that mess down in the basement. 
Oh, okay. I'll... 
I'll get on that. 
Good morning, Jane. 
Danielle, hey. 
How was your, uh, your date last night? 
Go figure. He canceled. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
His loss. 
That's right. 
Anyway, I gotta run. 
Can we, uh, can we catch up later? 
Sure. 
Great. 
Tell Henry I say hi. 
She's sweet. 
Mm-hmm. 
Lucky to have found someone like Henry. 
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it." 
I think I've heard that before, somewhere. 
Mm-hmm. 
I hope it's true. 
Somebody? 
Aah! 
I was right about Henry. He's a hero. 
I can take your 15 minutes and make it a lifetime. 
Oh!  
Am I interrupting something? 
She's his patient. He's 
examined her a bunch of times. 
He got out. 
Who?  
Daddy. 
Look out!  
Aah! 
There's no sign of a body anywhere. 
How does a body just disappear? 
You have no idea.  
What you've stolen. 
Return the box before it's too late for both of us. 
This is not over. 
Jane? 
You okay? 
Baby, what you went through last night, it's gonna take some time to get past it. 
Well, listen, I didn't want to wake you, but the police called. 
Two detectives will be coming over later to talk about what happened, if you're feeling up to it. 
Yeah. Yeah, I mean... 
The sooner the better, right? 
Yeah. 
Definitely. 
Look, Jane, the police are gonna find this psycho. 
I just... 
I wish I knew why he came after me. 
I'm gonna get you some coffee, okay?  
Okay. 
Besides the Drake being robbed, other assets of yours were also targeted. 
Four major buildings had their security systems hacked and disabled. 
Someone's sending a message that they can get to me. 
Yes, you and your wife. 
Not a word to Olivia about the robbery. 
I don't want to scare her. 
Of course.  
Better if she doesn't know. 
Who is behind this, Sam? 
I want this bastard found quickly. 
Yeah? 
Do you have it? 
Yeah. I got it. 
Then $1 million is yours, Mr. Wallace. 
Today at noon, Gramercy Park. 
What's--what's in this thing? 
It's not important. 
But it's important enough for you to pay me a million bucks for it. 
Maybe it's important enough for someone else to pay me double. 
I'll give you $3 million for the box. 
3 will do it. 
On one condition. 
Mr. Wallace? 
Uh, yeah. 
What's that? 
Don't open the box. 
Ms. van Veen? I'm detective Jarvis. 
My partner detective Cooper. 
Mind if we ask you some questions? 
Please, come in. 
I don't know why my husband is insisting upon a blood test. 
All this fuss isn't necessary. 
But thank you, Dr. Evans. 
Oh, that's one of the perks of having the cardiology wing named after you. 
All right, I'm gonna rush these results, um, but I wouldn't be too concerned about fainting last night. 
Now this is just my humble medical opinion, but I think you have a common case of, uh, champagne-itis. 
Oh. 
Now I need you to relax... 
And not move for a couple minutes. 
Can you do that? 
Ah, I'll try. 
Here you go, darling.  
Mm. 
Feel better.  
I'll walk you out. 
Hell of a party. 
A little rough for you, apparently. 
Oh, this?  
Yeah. 
This was a-a misunderstanding. 
Ah. Thanks for the house call. 
Listen, could you do me a favor? 
I want you to bring me the test results first. 
And about the underpayment in your rent this month, we'll call it even. 
Yeah, that. 
My apologies. I... 
Perhaps I was bit optimistic, thinking I could manage a park Avenue address. 
I was under the impression that E.R. 
doctors made a good living. 
We do, but unfortunately I'm still paying off the education that got me here. 
People... 
Trust you with their lives. 
I think I can trust you with a loan. 
Really? 
You know, I-I wouldn't feel right accepting money from you, Mr. Doran. 
Everybody needs a band-aid now and then, even doctors. 
How much do you need? 
Would say, uh... 
$50,000 be too much? 
So it's--it's right here. 
After he killed the man in the devil costume, he chased me down here to this dumbwaiter. 
So you climbed inside and pulled yourself to the fifth floor? 
Yes. 
I barely made it out before he cut the rope. 
Please take a look at this, ma'am. 
Wait. I don't understand. I... 
I was right here. I-I crawled inside. I... 
You have the recording of the 9-1-1 call. 
I mean, I-I found her on the fifth floor. 
Sure, Mr. Martin. 
Did you see the killer that she's talking about? 
What about the man she saw killed? 
Could it have been a Halloween prank someone took too far? 
No, I Look, I don't know why there's no sign of what happened, all right, but Jane was attacked, and you need to be acting like this guy is still out there. 
Respectfully, Mr. Martin, 
that's what we're doing. 
Come on in, Tony. 
I, uh, I wanted to apologize for losing Mrs. Doran 
last night at the party. 
There were circumstances beyond your control. 
Yeah, yeah.  
Well... 
And thank you, by the way, for, uh, saving me from those circumstances. 
I, uh, I definitely owe you one. 
I'm glad you feel that way. 
There's a job I think you'd be well-suited for. 
Detail the limo? 
Uh, more along the lines of the other work that you've done for me sometimes. 
There is some new information on who tried to run over Olivia, and I need someone brought to the Drake for a meeting, and I'm certain he will refuse the request. 
Well, my, uh, mother always said I had a persuasive charm about me, and my father always said I had a pretty good overhand right. 
Feel free to make your father proud. 
Mr. Wallace couldn't follow 
simple instructions. 
Don't open the box, Charlie. 
Torch it. 
What are you doing up so early? 
Oh. Um... nothing. 
I-I just... couldn't sleep. 
I'm in the mood for pancakes. 
You want some? 
Yeah. 
Your blood test was pretty conclusive. 
Too much alcohol, not enough hors d'oeuvres, and that combination put your glycemic number in the basement. 
Sometimes I forget to eat when I get busy. 
Sorry for the trouble, doc. 
No trouble at all. 
Can I get you some more coffee? 
Yes, please. 
Honey?  
No, thank you. 
Okay. 
Look, Mr. Doran, 
there's some information that I didn't cover with your wife. 
Her tests showed a powerful anesthetic in the blood. 
Actually, chloroform. 
Olivia was the victim of some foul play at the party. 
I'm handling the situation, but I appreciate your discretion in the matter. 
Well, I figured, we're helping each other out, right? 
That's right. 
Did the money get wired into your account? 
Yes, it did. 
Thanks again. 
Number 6 was a whole furlong back! 
Detective Cooper. 
Oh, Mr. Martin. What can I do for you? 
I'm just checking in. 
Any leads on the guy who attacked Jane? 
Not really. 
Not really?  
That's unacceptable. 
Jane is ready to move because that psycho is still out there. 
Have there been any... problems 
between you two lately? 
What? 
Not at all. What does that 
have to do with anything? 
Well, being upset can manifest itself in negative ways. 
Sometimes people see things that aren't there. 
What the hell are you getting at, detective? 
I mean, if you could've seen the look in her eyes when I found her... she was terrified. 
She's not making that up. 
Just a question, Mr. Martin. 
Is there any history of mental illness in Jane's family? 
Why would you ask me that? 
You and I both know what we didn't see on the walk through your building. 
We didn't find a body or single drop of blood or any damage at all. 
Should I keep going, Mr. Martin? 
We're gonna keep working things on our end, okay? 
But if this is a more personal issue with Jane, maybe--maybe you're better suited to deal with it. 
Thank you. 
Hello? 
Okay, so I know you wanna jump-start your political career, yes? 
Laurel? 
Yeah. 
Honestly, this is a, uh, it's a really bad time for this conversation. 
Okay, here's the deal. 
You have lunch in an hour with people who can turn your political aspirations into reality. 
When the opportunity of a lifetime comes knocking, you don't ignore it. 
Where am I meeting them? 
Well, uh, thank you for taking me to lunch, Olivia. 
I, uh... 
I definitely needed to get out. 
Oh, it's the least I could do. 
I-I feel awful about what you went through. 
God forbid you'd gotten hurt. 
So y-you spoke to the police. 
Do--do they have any leads? 
I doubt they're gonna catch this guy. 
It's just a-a feeling I have. 
Well, Jane, I don't want you to feel unsafe at the Drake. 
I'm just... 
I'm starting to feel like I don't belong here. 
Would you excuse me for a second?  
Sure. 
Enjoying your lunch, Mrs. Doran? 
I take it you're not the sommelier. 
No, but you might want a drink after we speak. 
Your husband isn't who you think he is. 
Underneath those impeccably tailored suits is a monster. 
What do you want, mister... 
Shaw. Call me Victor, please. 
I'm here to give you the opportunity to distance yourself from your husband before I take him apart. 
You think you're the first person who thought they had a chance at that, huh? 
Your husband excels at hurting people and taking everything from them. 
He took something from me, and now I have the opportunity to take it back. 
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw. 
I don't concern myself with Gavin's business. 
You should start, 'cause while he gives you the life that lets you wash down $40 appetizers with champagne and makes you feel special and makes you feel safe, you should know all of it's just a lie that he's whispering in your ear. 
Or you're lying to me now. 
Get a blood test from a doctor who isn't in your husband's pocket, and then ask Gavin why he's hiding the truth about what really happened Halloween night. 
Gavin, this is really not my thing. 
No, Sam, pay attention. 
We're gonna find out who betrayed us. 
Hey, hey, I-I-I don't know what you think I did, but you got the wrong guy here. 
I know exactly what you did, Mr. Trent. 
Oh, that? That was nothin'. 
I-I was just supposed to give her a scare, that's all. 
Mm. Well, I've been known to 
scare a few people myself. 
Luckily for you, I'm more interested in who hired you. 
So give me a name and you can go. 
I never met him. W-we 
just talked on the phone, and he dropped off the cash and instructions. 
I don't believe you. 
A name, Mr. Trent, if you 
want to ever leave the Drake. 
I'm sorry, Gavin, but I really shouldn't be here right now. 
Sam.  
Hey, Sam. 
No stomach for the rough stuff, Sam? 
Gavin, please. You think you 
can get that guy to talk? 
Sam, you of all people should know how persuasive I can be. 
What are you gonna do to him? 
Same thing I'm gonna do to you. 
Help! 
Help! 
Hey, somebody help me! 
Somebody! 
Somebody help!  
Hello?! 
Somebody! 
Don't be afraid. 
Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. 
Your, uh, doorman said you'd be up on the fifth floor. 
You here to point out more inconsistencies in my story? 
Not exactly. 
I'm here to ask you about this man. 
Oh, my God. 
That's--that's him. 
That's the man in the devil costume. 
I saw him get killed. 
Where did you find him? 
We traced the call you made to Henry's phone. 
Guy's name is Leo Forster. 
His girlfriend reported him missing two hours ago. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm not saying you held something back from me and my partner. 
If you did, I'd do my best to hear it right now. 
If I told you the truth... 
You'd think I was crazy. 
I'm a New York City cop, miss van Veen. 
I'm highly trained for crazy. 
Okay. 
When I said before that I didn't see the face of the man who attacked me... 
Well, uh... 
That's not true. 
I saw him. 
I... spoke to him. 
It was this man. 
Uh, Peter Kramer. 
A ghost attacked you. 
That's what you're saying? 
Wanna call Bellevue and put me in a straightjacket right now? 
Don't worry. 
I think Henry's pretty close to making the call himself. 
My grandfather died when I was 8 years old. 
We'd been pretty close. 
Afterwards, I thought I could feel his... 
Presence around the house. 
I could even smell the cigars he used to smoke. 
Well, my folks wrote it off my memory of him with an overactive imagination. 
One day, I'm helping my dad fix our old wall heater in the den, and he pulls out this box of cigars from behind the vent, and he tells me this is what I've been smelling, that my grandfather's ghost wasn't real. 
You're saying that there is a logical explanation for what's happening to me? 
I'm saying... 
People want there to be a logical explanation. 
It's what I realized when I found out my dad had bought those cigars and hid them in the vent for us to find. 
He didn't want me seeing anymore ghosts. 
And now... 
That's why I like to keep an open mind. 
Jarvis.  
I gotta go. 
Thanks for the coffee, miss van Veen. 
Laurel. 
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I was on a call. 
How's your shirt? 
What's wrong with my shirt? 
Okay, well, lose the tie. 
If I can't change the package, I can at least change the ribbon. 
Uh, I can do this. 
Debatable. 
Okay, so you are meeting with New York kingmakers Jeffrey Lang, Matthew Thompson, and John Buckley. 
Buckley? I've heard of Buckley. 
Yeah, you should've. 
He's backed the last four mayors of this city. 
You kiss his ring, and doors will open. 
You're welcome. 
Four mayors?  
I should've changed my shirt. 
How do you feel, Olivia? 
I can't seem to get rid of my headache. 
Gavin... how much did I drink? 
Well, before the absinthe? 
I recall seeing you with a bottle of Bollinger '97 at some point. 
And, uh, and then there were the Martinis at the top of the night. 
Guess I really overdid it. 
Well, you were never shy at a party. 
Should I have Dr. Evans come back? 
No, I-I think a massage would probably be better. 
Well, I can arrange for one of those as well. 
Gavin, thank you for... 
Looking after me. 
That's what a man does for the woman he loves. 
Why don't I go set up that appointment for you? 
Henry, slow down! 
What's wrong? 
Look, you were amazing back there. 
They loved you. 
They kept asking me questions about Jane. 
She should've been there. 
Hey, do you want me to provide advice and perspective? 
I'll take that as a "yes." 
Having Jane on your arm is not the image that you need right now. 
What the hell does that mean? 
It means New York's most eligible bachelor whether or not it's true-- is good for you. 
It gets you noticed, especially by women. 
Let me be clear with you, all right? 
Who I ammy life, my values Jane is a part of that. 
Look, Henry, your girlfriend is sweet and kind and beautiful, but look me in the eye and tell me that you think she understands what it takes to succeed in this town. 
No matter how much you love her, she is never gonna understand your drive to make a mark in city politics. 
You're wrong. 
I hope I am. 
Before you use the exit, I thought we should talk. 
How did you know it was me? 
Mr. Trent never put it together 
that you were the man who made the call, but the look in your eyes when you saw him tied to that chair... 
That was all I needed. 
Gavin, come on. 
We got a lot of history. 
I can make it right. 
I can help you get your box back. 
I'll do anything. 
Tell me what it was all about. 
As far as I know, money. 
The plan was to set up a dinner between you two. 
He'd bring your box, you'd bring him the $10 million in bearer bonds, and... 
Come on. 
Let's get out of here. 
You mean it? 
I just thought of a way you can be useful. 
Gavin? 
I want the truth not a version of the truth, not what you think I wanna hear. 
What are you talking about? 
You gonna make me ask again? 
I got another blood test, from a different doctor. 
Chloroform? 
The Drake had an uninvited guest the night of the Halloween party. 
He knocked you out, used you to distract me while he broke into the safe. 
This... whole charade 
because of bonds and jewelry? 
Not the safe in the closet. 
Oh, my God. 
Are--are we... in danger? 
Let me trade my apology for a promise. 
I will not let anything happen to you. 
This is the man I believe is responsible for the theft. 
I don't know his name yet, but Victor Shaw. 
He, um, he approached me today at lunch. 
He was trying to use me to hurt you. 
I just thought he was a creep. 
Hurt me how? 
Well, turning me against you. 
He knew you weren't telling me what had happened. 
But... 
How could he know that? 
Same way he knew about the red box. 
Steinberg. 
Sam? 
Sam betrayed us? 
I've dealt with the problem. 
I don't want to leave another message. 
I need to speak... 
We need to talk. 
Dr. Evans, is this about 
using my generosity to indulge a gambling habit? 
No.  
What the hell is going on? 
H-how did I get this tattoo on my chest? 
Well, they say that a debt is a mark against the soul. 
Of course, we could just forget about the dollar figure, see if we can work out another form of repayment. 
Anything. 
I believe there's great value in having a doctor on call. 
Okay, I could do that for you. 
But... when I do call you, 
it'll be in your best interest to answer. 
Hey, I'm here. 
Over here. 
What are you doing? 
I was looking for a pen, and I saw this article on the desk. 
Everything you told the cops about Halloween night it's all here, Jane. 
What happened in 1929 is almost exactly what you described. 
You think I made it all up? 
Yeah, I don't know what to think. 
Is this all because you wanna leave the Drake? 
I knew you wouldn't believe me. 
Oh, come on, Jane. We're 
not gonna talk about this? 
Well, it sounds like you have it all figured out. 
Hello, Mr. Shaw. 
I see no introductions are necessary. 
You gift wrapped my money. 
It was a Olivia's idea. 
You left quite an impression on her at lunch. 
She's lovely. You're a lucky man. 
She's so full of life. 
You didn't bat an eye at the price. 
We both know this isn't about money. 
It's about justice. 
I'm going to take everything away from you, Gavin, just like you do to everyone else. 
You fancy yourself a hero then? 
No, I'm... just a man who's found a way 
to get back what you stole from me a long time ago. 
Oh, I don't return things once they're in my possession. 
That's why I secured my leverage first. 
The red box. 
Why don't you tell me what you really want? 
I want the Drake, and you're going to hand it over to me, or I'm going to Open the box.  
Right. 
You're confident you can release what's inside? 
Do you think that I would go to the trouble of getting it and not know what I was dealing with? 
I think you're bluffing. 
What does Olivia think? 
Very romantic, what you did for her, rescuing her from an obsessive lover. 
But you couldn't just make him disappear like your average resident, because this particular resident... 
Was anything but average. 
So... 
You imprisoned him. 
I wonder what would happen if he got out. 
Now... 
Still think that I'm bluffing? 
I'm going to give you a chance to walk away from this fight, Mr. Shaw. 
And I strongly suggest you accept my offer. 
$10 million is a hell of an expensive dinner. 
Oh, it's not money. 
It what happens when I win. 
Listen, Henry, I... 
I love you. 
But the more I think about the Drake, the more I know I need to leave this place. 
Look, Jane, I, uh... 
As much as I love it here, I love you more. 
All right, so if we have to go to Brooklyn or Jersey or... 
I wanna go back to Indiana. 
To Indi--what? 
I've been thinking about it, and... 
You know, things were... 
They were... simpler there. 
Jane.  
We were safe. 
No, Jane, we need to talk about this. 
I wanna stay with you, Henry. 
I do. I wanna be with 
you, but I can't be here. 
If I stay here--if I stay here, I'm gonna go crazy or I'm gonna get hurt or... or worse. 
Jane, you're having a whole conversation about our life, and I'm not allowed to be a part of it? 
Well, obviously I want you to come with me, but I can't ask you to do that. 
I know that you need to be here. 
Okay, Jane, you know what? 
Whatever the truth is, tell me. 
All right, don't hold anything back. 
Tell me why you can't stay here with me. 
I've tried. I've tried 
to tell you the truth. 
What? 
I see things. 
I hear things. 
I do! 
Okay, there is-- there is a darkness coming from this place, Henry. 
Peter Kramer tried to kill me. 
And I know that that means he was a ghost, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't real. 
Jane, I think, um... 
I think being in this building every day is starting to freak you out. 
You don't believe me. 
I believe that you believe it. 
But I think that maybe you should start talking to someone. 
I'm talking to you now. 
I mean a professional, Jane. 
You said it yourself. 
You said your own grandmother went crazy, and she was in an institution. 
You think I'm crazy? 
I'm worried about you. 
I'm worried about us. 
Well, this is pretty far from a conversation about "us" right now. 
I'm gonna go for a walk. I... 
Henry. 
Are you seriously leaving right now? 
Yeah, I gotta think, Jane. 
Henry, wait. 
You come highly recommended, Mr. Kandinsky. 
How would you like to come and work for me? 
One small problem. 
I'm good at solving problems. 
*** What do we got? 
I got a prisoner *** *** Hello? Back it up. Back it on out of here. 
Dr. Evans, 
I believe a new patient named Kandinsky has just arrived. 
Time to start repaying that debt. 
I'm not killing a patient, if that's what you're talking about. 
This isn't about killing him. 
It's about setting him free. 
What if Shaw opens the box? 
I'll never let that happen, Olivia. 
Jocelyn. 
You're my grandmother.

I was right about Henry. He's a hero. 
H-how did I get this tattoo on my chest? 
Well, they say that a debt is a mark against the soul. 
There is a darkness coming from this place. 
If I stay here--if I stay here, I'm gonna go crazy or I'm gonna get hurt I believe a new patient named Kandinsky has just arrived. 
Time to start repaying that debt. 
I want the Drake. 
I'm going to give you a chance to walk away from this fight, and I strongly suggest you accept my offer. 
Hold the elevator, please! 
Thank you. 
Melanie. 
You're Lottie's daughter, right? 
That's me. 
Tenth floor, isn't it? 
Your mother is one of my favorite residents. 
She must be very excited to become a grandmother. 
And how's your little girl doing? 
How'd you know I was having a little girl? 
Mm, lucky guess. 
Melanie! What are you doing here? 
I brought you groceries. 
The farmers' market had some amazing peaches. 
I, uh... saw Mr. Doran in the elevator. 
Did you speak to him? 
Of course I did. What do you 
expect me to do, ignore him? 
He guessed I was having a little girl. 
I told you never to speak to him. 
You shouldn't come around here while you're pregnant. 
Why not? 
I get worried about you living in this place alone. 
You have to go. 
And don't come back until after this baby is born. 
 But what if I wanna see you? 
 Doesn't matter. 
I don't want you around the bad things in this building. 
Okay, w-what bad things? 
Mom, I'm not gonna leave you here if this place is dangerous. 
There's nothing you can do for me. 
I-I can't leave the Drake now. 
What are you talking about? 
For the sake of baby Nona, you have got to leave. 
 Mom. 
 No. 
Go on. 
 Mmama, stop! Y 
 No. 
 Get out of here. 
 You're acting crazy! 
Hello? 
Is anyone there? 
Please. Please, please. 
S-some--somebody?! 
P-please help me! 
How's that, grandma? 
Better? 
Corrected by Addic7ed.com 
I just spoke to Gavin, and they want us to ride over with them. 
Okay. Great. 
Babe, you're not excited? 
Come on, your boyfriend's getting a commendation from the mayor for being a badass. 
And we're going over there in a limo. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, it's, uh... 
It's great. 
You know what the weird thing is? 
I mean, I remember the gun, I remember swinging the chair at Kandinsky... 
Jane? 
What's going on? 
Everything's going so well for you, Henry. 
I-I'm proud of you, but... 
I can't stay here, not after what happened on Halloween night. 
I wanna go home. 
Look, I know something happened to you. 
 I'm not doubting that for a second. 
 Something. 
Henry, I don't feel safe here. 
Do you understand? 
I'm scared. 
Jane, you were the one that told me I shouldn't run away from my fear. 
You convinced me to come to New York, all right? 
And now everything is is going great for us. 
Us, not just me, Jane. 
We should go. 
We don't want to be late. 
Acting with courage and without regard for his own safety, Henry single-handedly stopped the gunman before he could fire his weapon again. 
Aristotle said that the greatest quality of the mind, next to honor, is courage. 
Henry Martin exemplifies both of these qualities. 
He's a new citizen of our great city, but we embrace him as one of our sons. 
And in recognition of his heroism, demonstrating exceptional bravery and citizenship, I am pleased to present Henry Martin with the bronze medallion. 
Henry, congratulations. 
Here, here! 
There he is. 
Henry! 
Hi. My hero. 
The whole time, I was imagining you behind that podium. 
"Mayor Henry Martin"-- has a nice ring. 
All right, let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
It was a nice honor, that's all. 
Uh, Jane, can I talk to you about something? 
Yeah. 
A friend of mine on the symphony board just bought a brownstone in Gramercy Park. 
She's looking for an architect, so I thought of you. 
Oh. Olivia, uh, thank you. 
Um... but listen, I've been 
meaning to tell you and Gavin, I've decided to leave New York. 
Why? 
I'm just not sure I really belong here, with... everything that's happened. 
You're running away? 
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it running way. 
I understand. It's just too bad. 
Just when opportunity decided to knock... 
Lou? 
Louise? 
Oh, my God, Brian. You scared me. 
Where's Louise? 
She's on a photo shoot in Miami. 
She asked me to send her a few things. 
Where have you been? 
I started to think you weren't coming back. 
I've been staying with a friend in Brooklyn, just until I can figure a few things out. 
I just came by to grab some stuff. 
I'm sorry about what happened between you guys. 
God, if any of this was... because of me 
Please stop. 
You're entering highly ironic territory. 
And look, it--it's been building for a while. 
I can't remember the last time that Louise and I were actually happy together. 
And for what it's worth, it's not like you made her sleep with that guy. 
She did that on her own. 
Brian, you read a text message. 
You don't know if she cheated. 
I saw the expression on Lou's face when she stepped off that elevator. 
I haven't seen that look in years. 
Least not for me, anyway. 
Well... I think you're a great guy. 
So, Henry, what's going on? 
Things have been a little weird for Jane at the Drake. 
She's... seeing things. 
I mean, she's convinced this place is It's an old building. 
Sometimes it gets under people's skin. 
Question is, you love her that much. 
You're willing to walk away from your dreams? 
Gavin, I couldn't imagine my life without her, but... 
I wouldn't be asking your advice if this were an easy decision. 
The best part of who we are is the women who love us. 
We're weak without them. 
And if we're smart, we'll do anything we can to keep them happy. 
That is exactly right. 
I remember you told me you wanted to marry Jane. Is that true? 
Yeah. Absolutely. 
I know it sounds quaint, but I believe in marriage. 
Are you saying propose? 
Oh, Gavin, I, uh... 
I don't think this is the right time. 
Then you make it the right time. 
You make it the perfect time. 
I think you have a bright future in this town, Henry. 
You're a hero now, but memory fades. 
You're not gonna get another shot like this to fulfill your promise. 
If I were you, I would do whatever I could to keep Jane right here. 
So you think if I propose to Jane, she's gonna stay in New York? 
I do. 
And if you're really serious about doing it, Henry, Olivia is the one to ask. 
Ask me what? 
Well, if... 
I was in the market for, say.. 
a diamond ring, Could you point me in the right direction? 
Meet me here tomorrow at 3:00. 
I'll take you to Judith Ripka. 
I've got the guy for you. 
All right. Thank you, Olivia. 
Gavin, I, um, I appreciate the advice. 
Always here for you, Henry. 
All right, have a good night, guys. 
Uh, Jane told me that she's leaving New York today. 
I'm not letting either one of them walk away. 
Well, the timing of this couldn't be worse. 
Darling, we're gonna be fine. 
And what about Victor Shaw? 
The situation is being dealt with even as we speak. 
Gotta make sure you're clean, Doc. 
I don't have any weapons on me. 
Can I please see my patient now? 
Thank you. 
What the hell happened to you?! 
Grandma? 
Are you out here? 
Grandma? 
How did you get out here? 
How are you even standing? 
Grandma... 
What's happening? 
Don't... 
Let... 
Jane... 
Leave. 
Walt, could you do me a favor and, take this letter upstairs to Mr. Doran, please? 
I-I'll watch the desk. 
Your resignation letter, huh? 
Why would you say that? 
Oh, I don't know. I just... 
kinda thought it. 
Right. Well, 
Can you just take the letter upstairs right now, please? 
 On my way. 
 Thank you. 
Tony's gonna be happy you're stepping aside. 
Jane? 
Nona. 
Where are you going? 
Nowhere right now. 
I'm just, uh, watching the desk for Walt. 
I mean, are you moving out? 
Well, uh... 
Actually, I was gonna tell people later this week. 
Yeah. I, uh... 
I'm moving back to Indiana. 
No, you can't. 
My grandma said I can't let you leave, Jane. 
Okay. 
Well, I've--I've never actually met your grandmother, And even if I had, it's really not her choice to make. 
Don't you get it? 
You're a part of this place. 
Okay, Nona, stop. 
This place scares me. 
Do you understand that? 
You run away, I lose the one person at the drake I can trust. 
Nona, it... 
Wow. I--Olivia, these are 
all beautiful, but... 
I get the feeling that I can't afford a ring box in this place. 
What kind of budget are we dealing with, Henry? 
Little over $3,000. 
Well, how--how--how much is this one? 
$3,000. 
Really? 
How much is this one? 
Around $3,000. 
Olivia, what are you doing? 
Helping you get engaged. 
That's all you need to know. 
Um, you know, Olivia, I proposed to Jane once before. 
And she said no? 
Well, it was-- it was spontaneous. 
We were caught up in the moment, And she wanted to wait till we got settled in New York. 
There's a right way and wrong way to do it, Henry. 
I know Jane's a small town girl, but inside, she's sophisticated. 
I doubt she'd say no to any one of these. 
Dr. Evans, what can I do for you? 
What the hell did you get me mixed up in? 
As I recall, you were short of funds, and I loaned you some money. 
What's the problem? 
I was supposed to help him escape, not kill two people. 
That was not... 
That was not part of the deal. 
All right, their blood is on your hands. 
You were the one who sewed a scalpel into your patient. 
What did you possibly think that was for? 
I paid my debt. I am done. 
You're done when I say you're done, Dr. Evans. 
That's the way it works when you owe me. 
You of all people should know by now money is never free. 
That wound looks pretty nasty. 
I'm fine. 
Tell me what you need. 
Victor Shaw-- B.A. from Harvard, 
M.B.A. from Wharton, 
made his fortune in shipping. 
If he weren't out to destroy me, I might actually admire him. 
You want me to kill this Victor Shaw? 
At some point, yes. 
But he stole something from me, of great value. 
I want it back. 
I'll bring him to you alive. 
That would be a great help. 
Right this way. 
The only thing more beautiful than that necklace is you. 
What do you want, Mr. Shaw? 
To buy you a gift. 
You can wear it to your symphony event at the Bergen Mansion. 
Oh. Why don't you join us tomorrow night? 
It's for a good cause. 
Gavin lets you step out of the gilded cage now and then? 
Hasn't the gold started to lose its luster? 
I prefer platinum. 
You don't strike me as the type of woman to be satisfied with just that. 
Ever think about cutting the lifeline? 
Being free of him? 
I can help you do that. 
I bet you think about it. 
You're suggesting I betray my husband. 
And why would I do that? 
Because secretly, I think you want to. 
What would I have to do for you? 
A simple show of allegiance. 
Jane? 
Oh, my god. You scared me. 
Even though it doesn't feel like we're moving, we actually are. 
That little girl... 
who is she? 
She's like me a child of the Drake. 
That's what my grandma calls us. 
We're connected to this building in a special way. 
You're special, too, Jane. 
No. 
I'm not. 
Then how was I able to step inside your dream? 
I gotta tell you, Henry. 
This marriage thing? 
Brother, it is complicated. 
Oh. But I thought you 
guys were making it work? 
Yeah, me too, but that was before Louise slept with the doctor from downstairs. 
What? 
But to be honest, I get it. 
You know, she thinks I'm not the same guy I was when we got married, and--and she's right. 
Well, Brian, everybody goes through rough patches. 
Yeah, but how do you think she feels? 
She's stuck with a husband who can't provide for her. 
She probably saw this Dr. Evans guy as a way out. 
All I know is, take my advice. 
Don't ever get married. 
It changes everything. 
What? 
I-I'm proposing to Jane tonight. 
So... 
Congratulations. 
Yeah. Thank you. 
Do you wanna keep jogging? 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Idiot. 
Hey. So... 
Last night... 
Did you... 
I told you, Jane. 
You're special. 
That's not possible. 
Come in. There's someone 
I want you to meet. 
Grandma? We have a visitor. 
It's the lady I told you about-- Jane. 
Uh, Jane, I want you to meet my grandma, Lottie Clark. 
Hello, Mrs. Clark. 
It's lovely to meet you. 
She can't talk anymore. I 
mean, she's in there... 
Somewhere. 
How long has she been like this? 
Couple years, right after my parents died. 
And you've been taking care of yourself this whole time? 
Nona, you should've told somebody. 
I-I should call social services, have somebody come in here. 
No! No, you can't tell anyone about her. 
They'll put her in a home. 
They'll put me in foster care. 
Nona, you're a minor taking care of an elderly woman with a very serious condition. 
I Doctors can't fix her. 
I mean, something happened to her right here, right inside the Drake. 
She was looking for answers, too, just like you. 
Answers to what? 
What happened to my mom and dad, what happens to a lot of people here. 
They die or just... 
disappear. 
Looking for something? 
What are you doing here? 
If you were leaving for a while, I wanted to say one more good-bye. 
Take care of yourself. 
Um, I-I'm sorry. 
I... I don't know what I was thinking. 
I just... 
wanted to do that one more time. 
Then what took you so long? 
I wanna show you something. 
Oh, my God. 
My grandma found most of this. 
I try to add to it when I can. 
This is incredible. 
You were the person that put that newspaper article under my door a few weeks ago, about the guy from the 1950s who was murdered. 
I found something else I think you might be interested in. 
Right there. The photo of the little girl. 
Take a look. 
Look on the back. 
Like I said, you're a child of the Drake, too. 
N-n-no. I... 
This isn't possible. I 
 Jane, it's you. 
 It is me, but I didn't leave Indiana till high school. 
I-I've never been here in the lobby. I... 
How did somebody take this picture? 
Maybe you should stay and find out. 
I mean, I didn't think I'd ever been to New York until I came here with Henry. 
This makes no sense. 
M-maybe you were too young to remember. 
In 1992, I-I was 8 years old. 
I think I'd remember coming to New York. 
I mean, this is crazy. 
What do you think it means? 
That's why you have to stay, Jane. 
 Jane, I'm home! 
 In here! 
 Hi, Nona. 
 Hey. 
What's going on? 
 Just hanging out. 
 That's fun. 
Uh, just don't forget we have our thing to get ready for tonight. 
Hey, Nona. 
 Let's talk later. Okay? 
 Definitely. 
 Scott! 
 Get out of my way. 
Dude, I have much bigger problems than you and your pathetic love life. 
Just tell me how long you were sleeping with my wife. 
 I never touched your wife. 
 Really? 
That's how you're gonna play it? 
Listen, you don't deserve this, but I'm gonna save you a lot of heartache. 
I never touched your wife. 
 I saw the text. 
 What text? 
Halloween. The party. 
You texted her to come up to your apartment. 
No. I had lost my phone, 
and it--it was gone all night. 
Till Alexis found it and gave it back to me. 
 Alexis? 
 Yeah, rightright after we hooked up. 
Wait. What. You and Alexis? 
H-how did I get this tattoo on my chest? 
Well, they say that a debt is a mark against the soul. 
You're not ready yet? 
Perfection takes time. 
Oh. You missed a spot. 
Let me. 
Any closer to finding the box? 
I have someone working on it. 
Shaw followed me to the jewelry store. 
He's gonna be at the symphony event tonight. 
If I didn't know better, I'd say he was interested in you. 
He asked me to help bring you down. 
Oh, of course he did. 
Maybe you should take him up on that. 
Gavin, he wants me to betray you. 
Mm. You know I'd never do that. 
I know. 
Wow. This place is amazing. 
Yes, it is. 
Champagne? 
Uh, no, thank you. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Just, uh... 
 Hungry. 
 Okay. 
Look around, Jane. 
You really want to give all this up? 
Jane. Henry. 
I am so glad you two could make it. 
Olivia. 
It's a perfect send-off before you head to greener pastures or wherever it is you're going to. Ohio? 
 Indiana. 
 I've never been. 
Henry, you look dashing tonight. 
Oh, thank you, Olivia. 
And thank you for everything you've done for us. 
Uh, will you excuse me? 
Listen, Henry, I was hoping somehow... 
You would want to come with me. 
But I know you can't. I know you can't. 
I love you, Henry. 
I love you so much. 
I can't leave without you. 
Stay here with me, Jane. 
I love you. 
Let's get out of here. 
All right. We'll talk. 
He's here. 
I'm aware. 
We don't want to be rude to our guests. 
Of course, darling. 
Why don't you fix your lipstick? 
Yes. 
Hello, Victor. Glad you made it. 
Happy to support any cause or woman in need of my assistance. 
A toast then. 
To leaving the gilded cage. 
I did what you made you do, Gavin. 
Now I want out of the deal. 
Perhaps you should give this to your husband instead. 
He doesn't drink champagne. 
Convince him. 
Convince me. 
Does that convince you? 
Dr. Evans, thank God you're here. 
That man needs your help. 
Somebody help! He's having a seizure. 
You weren't made to take lives, doctor. 
You were made to save them. 
Time is running out. 
I'm a doctor. 
2 milligrams of lorazepam. 
Hang in there. 
Are we close? 
What are you doing? 
We are going back to The Drake. 
You need to keep him alive. 
Do it now! 
Whoa. Hold it. Hold it. 
What the hell are you doing? 
Aren't you happy to see me? 
You made me think my wife was having an affair and then you tricked me into sleeping with you. 
No. 
You wanted me, from the first time you looked through your window and watched me undress. 
I gave you your fantasy. 
You are gonna stay away from me and Louise. 
I am gonna try to make this thing right, but if you get in my way, so help me Let go of me. 
This is my floor. 
I live in The Drake now. 
You were ready to walk away from all this? 
I do love this building. I just... 
I wish it didn't scare the hell out of me sometimes. 
Jane. 
Nona, hi. 
Can I talk to you? Please. 
 Of course. Give just me one second, okay? 
 Yeah. 
Nona, what's going on? 
My grandma's missing. 
She's missing? I... 
I thought you said she couldn't move. 
I don't know. I need your help. 
We'll find her. I promise. Let's go. 
So I have to go and help Nona with... 
something, but, uh, I'm gonna see you upstairs  in a few minutes, okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Just... 
Hurry back. 
Olivia. 
Grandma! 
Are you okay? 
Jane. 
Lottie? 
Lottie, it's Jane. We're 
gonna take you upstairs and put you back to bed, okay? 
 Grandma! 
 Lottie, no! 
Are you trying to tell me something? 
She's trying to look through it. 
The eye. 
What eye? 
On the mosaic. 
I remember the first time I saw it. 
The pieces of the mosaic are all original. 
Except for the eye. 
Careful! 
Oh, my God. 
Jane. 
What are you doing? 
I'm going down. 
Let me come with you. 
No. You stay there with Lottie. 
It's okay. I... 
I think this is something I'm supposed to do. 
It's closing, Jane! 
 Hurry! 
 Nona!

From the first time you looked through your window and watched me undress, you wanted me. 
Sasha and Gavin had a falling-out the night before. 
I was the one who found the note. 
Gavin doesn't know. 
You want me to kill this Victor Shaw? 
At some point. But he 
stole something from me. 
I want it back. 
I'll bring him to you alive. 
This is incredible. 
Careful! 
I'm proposing to Jane tonight. 
I think this is something I'm supposed to do. 
It's closing! Jane! 
Nona! 
 Thank you.  
 Sure. 
Are we gonna be okay here? 
Henry, I don't feel safe here. 
Do you understand? 
I'm scared. 
No one has seen her for over 36 hours, so it's definitely cause for concern. 
Now I'm not gonna speculate at this point Of course not. Any resources 
you need, you let me know. 
I'll call the police commissioner myself. 
Thank you, but we've got a lot of eyes on this. 
Every cop in the city's got her picture, including port authority. 
Don't let us down, detective Cooper. 
Bring Jane home. 
I'll do my best. 
I put flyers up all over. 
Nothing. 
Where is she? 
Oh, Henry, we're so sorry. 
I've got a call in to a top-notch investigator I know. 
He'll be here in a couple of hours. 
Anything we can do to help, let us know. 
I appreciate it. 
Hey. So I spoke to Nona again. 
Apparently, she and Jane split up in the basement while they were looking for her grandmother. 
She said it's the last time she saw her. 
Why haven't you guys followed up on the lunatic from Halloween? 
The one that attacked Jane? 
That seems like a pretty obvious place to start. 
We're tracking that. And a bunch 
of other leads, too. Okay? 
Call me if you hear anything. 
Where are you, Jane? 
You shouldn't have come here. 
Henry! 
Corrected by honeybunny Her name's Jane van Veen. 
I posted the missing persons report. 
You have any idea what happened to her? 
She hasn't spoken since your guys brought her in. 
They found her wandering around Times Square. 
I've requested a psych consult. 
Ma'am, I need to see her now. 
I'm her boyfriend. I just got 
a call that she was here. 
Hey. 
 Janewhere is she? 
 Slow down. She's here. 
 Where? I want to see her.  
 She's been through something, Henry. 
She's really fragile right now. 
Hey. Hey.  
Get your hands off me. 
Jane? 
Henry? 
Mr. Doran? 
We have her. She's okay. 
That's excellent news. 
What happened to her? 
I'm not really sure yet. 
But just so you know, they're gonna still keep her at the hospital for a little while. 
Understood. I'll give Olivia the good news. 
Thank you for the courtesy of the phone call, detective. 
You're welcome. 
Why don't you make this easy on yourself? 
Where is the box? 
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about. 
Only thing that came out of his mouth was this. 
Unfortunately, I see we're at a impasse, Mr. Shaw. 
I was hoping that as businessmen, we could reach some kind of arrangement. 
I know how you do business, Doran. 
The M.R.I. shows no physical 
damage to her brain. 
Physically, she's fine. 
It seems she's had some kind of dissociative episode. 
What do you mean, "dissociative"? 
Basically, her brain is blocking out something traumatic. 
It's rare, but there have been documented cases. 
Sounds counterintuitive, but for her to heal, she needs to remember. 
All right, well--well, how does she do that? 
I want to keep her here for a few days. 
Some intensive therapy, there's a chance she could start to work it out. 
Look, doc, I-I know Jane better than anyone, and she won't want to be here. 
I mean, is there a way I can take her home and a doctor can see her there? 
I know you want to take care of her, but she needs to be in the hospital now. 
Well, that's your opinion. 
Look, we're required to keep her here under observation for 48 hours. 
It's the law. 
I'm sorry. 
Welcome home. 
It's really good to be back. 
So did you move in yet? 
All moved in. Fifth floor. 
I have an amazing view. 
I can't wait to see it. 
Louise. 
You are looking rested. 
Gavin, thank you so much for helping with that, um, thing that I called you about. 
Those things are harder to get into than Manhattan preschools. 
I couldn't have gotten a spot without you. 
You just take it one day at a time, like they say. 
Olivia and I are here for you. 
Now what about you, Ms. Blume? 
How are you settling into the building? 
It's perfect. 
I'm so glad to hear that. 
Welcome back, Louise. 
I'm sure Brian can't wait to have you home. 
So what do you think Brian's gonna say about me coming back? 
What do you think? He's 
gonna be happy to see you. 
You have to tell him. 
Brian? 
Lou. 
You're home. 
How was the photo shoot? 
There was no photo shoot. 
What do you mean? 
I was in rehab, Brian, for prescription drugs. 
Painkillers. 
You've been using again? 
I started taking the pills after the elevator accident. 
And then I couldn't stop. 
And then you left, and I didn't know what to do. 
Why didn't you tell me, Lou? 
You didn't need to go through that alone. 
I wanted to. I just 
I couldn't. 
I don't know. I was 
I was ashamed. 
I feel like this could be a chance for for me to start over. 
I know that sounds silly It's not silly. 
It's not. 
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
I'm so sorry about the whole thing with Dr. Scott. 
Look, don't be. I'm the 
jerk who punched him out because I didn't trust you. 
I feel like this crisis could be an opportunity for us to start fresh. 
No secrets this time. 
No secrets. 
I want to go home. 
Jane, it's only 48 hours. 
I don't want to be here. 
I know. But I don't think 
it's such a bad idea either. 
You think I belong here? 
Jane, why can't you remember what happened to you when you disappeared? 
I don't know. 
I want you to come home and I want you to be okay, but we gotta make sure this doesn't happen again. 
I'm scared. 
Me, too. 
Did you tell the doctor about your grandmother? 
Jane, there's mental illness in your family. 
No, I didn't, because I'm not crazy. 
Hello, Jane. I'm Nurse Potter. 
I'll be taking care of you while you're staying with us. 
I just need to take your vitals, okay? 
 Okay.  All right, I'm gonna let 
you get some rest. I love you. 
Open up? 
Under your tongue. 
I can tell we are going to get along just great. 
Thank you. 
And now blood pressure. 
Calm. 
Jane, calm down. 
No. No. No. 
 No. No. No. No. No. Please. Please. 
Don't do this. - Jane, stop it. 
 Get off. Get your hands off me! 
 Jane. Security! 
Help! Help! Help! 
 Get off now! I want it off!  
 Jane, stop. Jane. Hold her arms. 
 I'm gonna sedate her.  
 No! No! No! No! No! Please! 
You shouldn't have come here. 
No! Help! Help! Somebody! 
 Get off me!  
 Jane. 
Get your hands off me! No! 
Uh, Jane van Veen? 
Yes? 
I'm a friend of hers. It's 
really important I see her. 
Hey, Nona, right? 
Hi, detective Cooper. 
What's so urgent? 
Uh, nothing. I just 
I just wanted to see how Jane was doing. 
She can't remember anything about the last couple days, so... 
Oh, my God. 
Nothing? 
Do you have any idea what might've happened to her? 
I-I told you, no. 
Well, I'm gonna be speaking with Jane soon, if you want me to tell her anything. 
Uh, when you see her, will you give her this? 
I hope she'll know what it means. 
It was the blood pressure cuff. 
Acted like I was gonna kill her. 
Like that guy last month. 
Julian waters. 
I tied the tourniquet to draw his blood. 
He started screaming that nonsense about a spiral staircase. 
It was just the tourniquet? 
It took four of us to hold him down. 
He's been in "D" wing ever since. 
Found him wandering the streets, too. 
Strange. 
Julian. 
Hey. One romantic reunion dinner coming up. 
Don't worry, it's gonna to be okay. 
Alexis is having some boy trouble. 
That's too bad. 
I'm really sorry to bother you guys right now. 
I know you have a lot going on. 
I just I didn't know what to do. 
Alexis is involved with a married man. 
Oh. Sounds dangerous. 
I know. 
Such a cliche. 
Gosh, I'm a mess. 
I don't feel bad about it, though. 
His wife is a bitch. 
She has serious baggage. 
I mean, from the moment we met, I could tell we were meant to be together. 
I got it. 
He needs me, even if he doesn't know it yet. 
Do you remember anything? 
No. Nothing. I 
I need to get back to the Drake, retrace my steps. 
Well, look, if I can get you released sooner, I will. 
I think... 
I think there's somebody in here like me. 
He's a patient named Julian waters. 
The nurse said he's in "D" wing. 
What do you mean, "like you"? 
I mean... 
found in the same condition. 
Supposedly, he--he said things. 
Uh... 
Maybe he knows what happened to me after I disappeared. 
Do you recognize the name? 
Mnh-mnh. 
Does he live at the Drake? 
I don't know. 
Jane, the... 
the "D" wing is high-security. 
It's for violent patients. 
Whoever this Julian waters is, you don't want to talk to him. 
I almost forgot. Nona... 
wanted me to give this to you. 
It's my, uh, my grandmother's necklace. I... 
I thought I'd lost it. I... 
And this... 
You know what they mean? 
No. Uh, just... 
sentimental value. 
Thank you for this. 
Oh. Yeah. 
Jane? 
Henry. Hi. 
Detective Cooper. 
Hey. I was just taking off. 
I've been wondering... 
how you know so much about me... 
how you know about my business. 
So I had Mr. Kandinsky do some digging, 
and it turns out, you're not a Shaw at all. 
You used your mother's maiden name. 
Your father's name is Joseph Lukin. 
Quite a character. 
I met him just after he defected from East Germany. 
And I seem to recall that he had left behind a wife and a young boy. 
Any of this coming back to you? 
He had a fire inside. 
He was willing to do anything to succeed, and that included abandoning his son. 
Sad, really. 
Your own father. 
Can't pick your family, can you? 
No. You get what you get. 
Take Sasha, for instance. 
Sasha? 
Your daughter. Remember her? 
The one who died in the accident? 
The one whose car spun out of control? 
That is, if you trust what the police report said. 
Be careful where you step, Mr. Shaw. 
Your wife knows the truth about Sasha's death. 
She killed herself. 
It wasn't suicide. 
She figured out who you really were, what kind of man you were. 
That's why she killed herself. 
You terrified her. 
This makes no sense. 
Time for your pills. 
It's okay. I-I don't feel like I need them. 
Doctor's orders, Jane. 
Take your pills or I'll make you take them. 
Okay now. 
Lights out. 
Hello? 
Hello? Can you hear me? 
Julian waters. 
I need to talk to you. 
Who are you? 
Please. 
I need your help. 
You work for him? 
You think I'm gonna talk to you? 
Did you live at the Drake? 
Do you know about the mosaic? 
The spiral stairs? 
I told you to stop. 
Please. You have to tell me. 
Did you go down the stairs? 
No. 
I came up the stairs. 
Sweetheart, what are you doing? 
I had a chat with, uh, with Mr. Shaw, and he told me something 
that was quite disturbing. 
About what? 
About our daughter. 
What about her? 
Victor Shaw is of the opinion that she didn't die in that car by accident. 
He thinks she took her own life and he says you know this. 
Is it true? 
How do you know? 
There was a not,. 
From Sasha. 
I burned it. Uh, Gavin, 
she said some--some terrible things about you. 
I don't need protecting. 
 I know you don't.  
 She was my daughter, too. 
How could you keep this from me? 
I had a right to know. 
Because I loved you. 
I didn't want to see you get hurt. 
Gavin, she was gone. 
Look, Victor Shaw is using this to divide us. 
The most important thing is we get that red box back. 
He hit you with the one thing you couldn't bear. 
Return the favor. 
Wow. Somebody likes to 
live on the edge. Sexy. 
Don't you ever pull that kind of stunt again. 
Do you understand me? 
I want you out. 
You're gonna quit the job with Louise, you're gonna leave this building, and we are done. 
Don't play hard to get. I 
thought we were past This isn't a game. 
I know it all happened very fast between us, but we can't fight fate. 
The universe wants us to be together. 
In time, you'll see it, too. 
No. 
I won't, because it's all in your head. 
I don't want you. 
I don't want us. Do you--do you get it? 
I want you out of my life. 
Written anything good lately? 
Yes? 
Hmm. I wonder what got you over the hump. 
You didn't get hot right after we made love the first time, did you? 
You're insane. 
That had nothing to do with it. 
It's closing! Jane! Hurry! 
Nona! 
Julian? 
Julian, it's Jane from the Drake. 
Oh, my God. 
Julian? 
You shouldn't have come here. 
That was nice. 
God, it's been forever. 
Yeah, no kidding. 
Hey. You okay? 
Yeah, I just, uh, I gotta get back to work. 
Why don't I make us lunch? 
I'm starving. 
Sure. 
What the hell? 
How about a grilled cheese? 
Come on. Damn it. 
 What's wrong?  
 My computer's not working. 
I just replaced the logic board. 
You have a visitor. 
I still can't remember anything. 
All right. Well, give it time. 
I want to come home. 
Please. 
I don't like it here. 
I know. Soon. 
A patient killed himself last night. 
What? 
His name was Julian waters. 
He was in the security ward. He said 
He said? You talked to him? 
How did you talk to him if he's in another ward? 
I snuck out of my room. 
I had to see if he knew anything about what happened to me after I disappeared. 
Why would he know what happened to you? 
It's complicated. 
Please. Henry. 
You have to get me out of here. 
Yeah, I'm I'm doing my best. 
I'm not sick, Henry. 
I know. 
Victor. 
Can you hear me? 
Son. 
Son. 
It's me. 
Impossible. 
I'm sorry I didn't say good-bye. 
I never thought I'd see you again. 
I'm sorry for leaving you and your mother. 
I always meant to send for you, but... 
Well, there's no excuse. 
Not really. 
I should have. 
I didn't. 
Forgive me. 
Of course I forgive you. 
We are in danger here, son, both of us. 
You have to give Gavin what he wants. 
You understand? 
I still owe him and I'm running out of time. 
Where is it? 
I gave it to a priest, where mama's buried. 
Good boy. 
I know exactly where that is. 
What did you say? 
Dad. 
Hello, Mr. Shaw. 
I was dreaming? 
Your mother's buried at Saint Thomas church. 
Isn't that right? 
What did you say? 
The red box it's at Saint Thomas Church. 
Thank you, Mr. Shaw. 
Damn you, Doran! 
You son of a bitch! 
Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. 
But all things considered, that's a tall order for someone like you to absolve someone like me. 
They said you might come. 
So you know who I am and why I'm here. 
A mutual acquaintance of ours gave you something that belongs to me. 
The red box. 
Your powers of perception are nothing short of divine. 
He said you wouldn't be able to enter this hallowed place. 
Really, father? 
I love churches. 
What did you do to me? 
What did you do to me, damn it? 
Nothing you didn't want. 
I can't write. 
My computer freezes. The 
pens run out of ink. 
The pencils break. My mind goes blank. 
I tried to tell you, Brian. 
The universe wants us to be together. 
You write... 
when you're with me. 
You're blocked when you're with her. 
That's not possible. 
There's no connection. There 
You know you want me. 
The writing is just the excuse. 
Doctor's orders. 
It'll help you relax. 
Thank you. 
My pleasure. 
Miss van Veen, if you'll come with me, please. 
Wait. Where are you taking me? 
 Someone wants to talk to you.  
 No! 
Jane. Cooper. 
Thanks, doc. 
I don't even wanna know how you pulled that off. 
Dr. Anton needed some help with a D.U.I. 
last year. 
I guess it pays to have friends in high places. 
Especially when they owe you favors. 
Thank you for believing me. 
Come on. 
I'll take you home. 
Okay. 
I was the only one who knew it was suicide. 
How did you know the truth about Sasha? 
She told me. 
Don't mock me, Mr. Shaw, not about this. 
I'm not mocking you. 
Your daughter is still alive. 
Whether you hit me again or not, it's the truth. 
How dare you lie to me about my child. 
You don't have to believe me, but I promise you this after I'm gone, you're going to wonder for the rest of your life if I was telling the truth. 
Yeah. 
I know where she is. 
Let me go. 
I'll take you to her. 
I think it's time we close the deal with our friend Shaw. 
Alexis, come in. 
A moment, please? 
I'll wait outside. 
What can I do for you? 
I can't do this anymore, Gavin. 
I feel terrible for him. 
He's losing his mind. 
Alexis, I've seen how you light up with Brian. 
Seems to me like you're enjoying your little trysts as well. 
You make a striking couple. 
I can't deal with the guilt. 
I know what you did for me, but I-I'm not cut out to destroy people. 
Well, you should've taken your tender nature into consideration first. 
We all have to pay to play, my dear. 
At least you've got company. 
Oh, Henry. 
Jane. 
 Henry.  
 You're home. 
I didn't know they were letting you out. 
No one called me. 
How did you get out of the hospital? 
Uh, they just let me go. Um... 
I just couldn't stay there anymore. 
You feel all right? 
Yeah. 
I do now. 
Good. 
I love you, Jane. 
I don't want anything to happen to you. 
Me either. 
Oh, my God. I thought 
you were gone forever. 
It's okay. I'm, uh... 
I'm okay. 
Y-you went down the stairs, and the mosaic closed. 
I was freaking out. 
Where did you go? 
What did you see? 
I don't know. I... 
I can't remember anything. 
I think I know someone who can help you. 
Nona, who is this person? 
Her name's Maris. 
She knows things about the Drake. 
I think she can help you remember. 
The only question is can you handle it? 
Will you come with me? 
She doesn't exactly like company. 
You have to go in alone. 
Okay. 
Here goes nothing. 
﻿1  Let me know you're here...  
(music continues over radio) Wow, dollar Lemon Drops, and all of Westchester shows up. 
Yeah, never underestimate the power of cheap booze. 
And a hot, new, Ivy-educated bartender. 
You want me to close for you. 
No! 
(chuckling): Yes! 
Okay, maybe a little bit. 
Go. 
All I have waiting for me are LSAT practice tests. 
You're the best! 
Your fortune, Dolly. 
Thank you. Now, 
I am totally gonna hire you if I ever get arrested. 
Or divorced. 
Mm. 
Bye. 
(chuckling): Bye. 
(lights buzzing) (bottles clinking) (hisses) Aah! 
(animal squeaks) (shivers) (starter clicking) What? No. 
(starter continues clicking) (groans) (sighs) Ugh. 
(dialing) (line ringing) WOMAN: Hello. 
(sheepishly): Hi, Mom. 
I'm like AAA but with outerwear. 
Would you put that on? 
It's freezing out. 
I'm so sorry I dragged you all the way out here, but the good news is I made a lot in tips. 
Enough to cover tuition? 
Eh. Books for, like, 
(chuckling): one class. 
Already a lawyer like Dad. 
You're just lucky I was on call. 
He would've killed you. 
That wasn't luck. 
You always come running when I need you. 
What are these guys doing? 
Hey! We're closed! 
Hello, we're closed! 
We're good here! 
Get in my car. 
Get in my car. 
Get in my car! 
Now! Go! 
(grunts) Mom. 
Mom. 
(screams) (yelps) (crying) (crying): Please, please, please. 
Please. 
(gasps) Please, please. 
(growling) (growling, men yelling) (growling, men screaming) (low snarling) (sirens wailing in distance) (low snarl) (running footsteps) (sirens continue wailing in distance) CATHERINE: Everyone told me it was a wild animal a coyote, a bear. 
That this thing I thought I'd seen was just the result of my concussion or post-traumatic stress. 
You know, the men who'd killed my mother were beasts. 
I believed them... 
...until now. 
  (siren chirping) (siren chirping) Hey, Detective, what you doing? 
Just give me five. 
Zeke! 
Hey. Sorry. Ooh! 
(chuckles) Um, you know my boss hates his wife, which means he never wants to leave work, which means I don't get to... 
Which means you didn't get my text. 
What? 
At first your job was kind of a turn on. 
Now it's kind of a drag. Like tonight, 
if I want to smoke pot... 
Look, you can smoke pot. 
I don't care. 
WOMAN: Hey! 
Z-babe! 
"Z-babe"? 
Sorry, Cat. 
It's just been stressing me out. 
Really? 
That's what you texted me? 
We got to bust. 
You know what, Z-babe? 
This wasn't working for me either. 
Security! 
That guy's got pot on him. 
Guys... 
(phone ringing) Chandler. 
WOMAN: You should've tased him. 
"Kind of a turn on." 
So what, he was in it just for handcuffs? 
Don't guys know they just remind us of work? 
Tess, he didn't ask for the cuffs. 
(sighs) You have a blind spot for douches. 
See, when I date a douche, I know he's a douche, which is why I'm on a man cleanse. 
Good, 'cause you can be my date to my dad's engagement party. 
Special Crimes. 
911 got a call off her cell at 8:32 tonight. 
No recording. 
Blunt trauma to the head. 
No wallet, no ID, no hotel key. 
Robbery homicide? 
And leave behind a Louis Vuitton? You know 
how much these things cost? 
No, and not every robber knows their Louis Vuitton. 
I knew it was a Louis. 
Regardless, it's a pretty public place to rob and kill someone. 
And this is a five-star hotel. 
Okay. Then can we get 
some five-star service? 
Maybe take a look at some security footage? 
Yeah? Oh, great. 
An injured woman walks into a hotel, no one even blinks. 
You got to love New York. 
So where is our bad guy? 
That we don't know, but we did ID the vic off cell records Ashley Webster. 
Not a hotel guest. 
Hey, boss. Google says 
she's executive editor at Couture Bleu Magazine. 
She have a husband? 
Boyfriend? Lesbian lover? 
Yeah, husband-- Alex Webster. 
Big fashion photographer. 
They're, like, a Page Six power couple. 
So, where is Mr. Powerful now? 
Haven't been able to track him down. 
But CSU did lift prints off a button. 
Hey. 
Get me the results. 
Right. 
CATHERINE: AFIS got a hit, and it's not the husband. 
Guy's name is Vincent Keller. 
What are his priors? 
None. Looks like 
he's military. 
He's dead. 
Specialist Vincent Keller, MD, New York City. 
Killed in Afghanistan by enemy fire, 2002. 
The rest is redacted. 
So, how do a dead guy's prints end up on a fashion editor's buttons? 
I would say talk to his family, but look, next of kin, they've all passed, too. 
MD. He was a doctor. 
Here. 
ER resident, St. Benjamin's. 
'99 to 2001. 
Okay. Let's find 
some colleagues. 
See if they know something. 
TESS (distantly): Cat? 
Cat? 
(normal voice): Hospital? 
Yes. Let's do it. 
WOMAN: Dr. Keller. 
'Course I remember him. 
Most of these residents come in cocky, thinking they know everything. 
Keller wasn't like that. 
You know he lost his brothers in the towers? 
No, we didn't. 
Yeah, he was here that day. 
Kept waiting for 'em to be brought in. 
Never came to work after that. 
That's why he enlisted. 
So, you haven't seen him since? 
For detectives, you two don't know very much. 
No, we know he's supposedly dead. 
Supposedly? There's a plaque in 
the lobby with his name on it. 
You remember anyone he hung out with, someone he would've reached out to? 
Keller wasn't exactly social, but he did have a roommate. 
"JT Forbes, medical researcher." 
This is where he lives a chemical plant? 
Researcher-- maybe he works from home? 
Yeah, or it's a meth lab. 
Just my type. 
Oh, a little Zeke rebound? 
You can make out in that. 
This'll be condos in two years. 
Guy needs a new decorator. 
JT Forbes? 
NYPD. 
Mr. Forbes, open up. 
(rock music playing in background) JT Forbes? 
I'm Detective Chandler. 
This is Detective Vargas. 
Uh, this isn't about that speeding ticket, is it? 
'Cause I'm gonna pay. 
No, we're here to talk to you about a former roommate, Vincent Keller? 
Vincent Keller? 
Vincent Keller. 
It sucks, you know? 
What happened. 
(turns off music) So young. 
So, I'm assuming you haven't heard from him recently? 
Like voices or...? 
No, like him. 
His fingerprints just showed up at a crime scene. 
Oof. Sounds like you need 
new fingerprint guys. 
Or is there any reason Mr. Keller might want people 
to think he's dead? 
Maybe he was in trouble... 
JT: He was in Afghanistan. 
Of course he was in trouble. 
TESS: A woman was murdered in the Stanwyck Hotel last night. 
Maybe you read about it? 
Think we could take a look around? 
Uh, listen, I'd love to help you guys, but I gotta take off. 
Bio-chem class to teach. 
Okay, well, let us know if you think of anything. 
Totally. 
Did you clock the stairs? 
Yeah, too bad creepy digs aren't grounds for a warrant. 
But, you know, maybe if you hook up with him... 
Or you break your man cleanse. 
(footsteps approach) What the hell did you do? 
That was her. 
 Beauty and the Beast 1x01  
Pilot  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Do you want a beer? 
No, no, I don't want a beer. 
I want you to tell me what the hell your prints are doing at a crime scene. 
Look, a woman was in trouble. 
Trouble? Trouble, 
trouble how? 
I mean, did you...? 
No, JT, I didn't hurt her. 
Well, congratulations 'cause now we've got her at our door. 
Yeah, well, I didn't know it was going to be her case, did I? 
Her case. Wh-What... 
Have you been keeping tabs on her? 
Vincent, you broke every rule: no interacting with anyone, no entering a building... 
Yeah, I know what the rules are, okay, I made them. 
It's been years, all right? 
It starts to feel like a prison in here. 
What prison has a flat screen and an Xbox? 
And if it's so hard for you, why'd you stop helping with the antidote? 
Yeah, because you know what the definition of insanity is, JT? 
Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, okay? 
That's why. 
All right, this is it, JT, this is my life. 
Okay. 
All I'm saying is, if Catherine Chandler starts asking questions, alerting Muirfield that you're alive... 
we're both dead men, and I don't mean "on a piece of paper" dead. 
I mean dead like dead dead. 
(siren chirps) Evan, please tell me that you have something. 
I've got a pair of Louboutins in an evidence bag. 
What size are you? 
You are so callous. 
Okay, so the head wounds are too superficial to have killed her, but she does have signs of low oxygenation. 
Suffocation, strangulation? 
No ligature marks, but she does have some rash. 
Possibly poisoning? 
But here's the weird part. 
I can't take much more weird. 
Bruised sternum, cracked ribs. 
You see that from CPR sometimes. 
So, after the killer left, someone tried to save her? 
Why wouldn't they have stuck around? 
That's your job. 
Oh, I did find a hair. 
DNA? 
Way to bury the lead. 
Um, keep me posted. 
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night? 
I've got premiere tickets. 
Free movie, open bar. 
What, that flight attendant on layover? 
Permanently transferred to Dallas. 
By you or by the airline? 
Well, it was coming up to three months. 
I may have pulled some strings. 
(phone beeping) Oh. 
Our vic's husband surfaced. 
Always the husband. 
See, this is why I stick to three months. 
Yeah, well, in this case, our prime suspect is a dead guy. 
I've never seen him before. 
And you were at your studio all night? 
Yes. 
I'm sorry to have to ask this, Mr. Webster, 
but anyone who can confirm that? 
The security guard. 
Oh, and, uh, I have the proofs that I was developing. 
Were you at a club as well? 
No. 
No, I was at a fund-raiser. 
I dropped in there on my way to the office. 
Did she go with you? 
No, no, she had to work. 
She just landed a big promotion. 
She started out as an intern there. 
Time-stamped from last night. 
Mr. Webster, 
that promotion you think it would have earned her any enemies? 
You'd have to ask her assistant Emily. 
You have a sleeping bag in there? 
I probably should. 
It's a 24-7 gig. 
I mean, it was. 
But, Emily, was anyone jealous of Ashley's promotion or up for that job, too? 
Maybe the beauty editor, but... 
The beauty editor? 
Chloe London. 
She thought that she deserved the job, but, I'm sorry, Ashley was the fashion editor. 
EVAN: Cat. 
DNA just came in. 
Can I talk to you for a sec? 
So who is it Vincent Keller? 
It's corrupted. 
Oh, you're kidding. 
Thing is, you know how you're always talking about your mum's case? 
Not always, but... 
Evan, you're making me nervous. 
No, no. 
I just wanted to give you a heads up. 
The mass spectrometer's probably just dirty. 
Cross-species DNA. 
 Your ancient threat   I can hear it from the garden   I can see it coming   I can see it come for miles...  
TESS: A little Zeke rebound? 
You can make out in that. 
(phone ringing) Hey. 
TESS: Hey, nice catch with JT's car, except I just woke up three of his students. 
All confirm he was teaching Molecular Cellular Methods 2 that night. 
Yeah, I'm here. 
I don't see you. 
Creepy warehouse-- I was up early, thought I'd check it out. 
No, that's what I'm telling you there's nothing to check out. 
I'll call you later. 
Hello? 
CATHERINE: NYPD. 
I've got a warrant. 
Mr. Forbes. 
(rustling) Mr. Forbes. 
Mr. Forbes? 
Mr. Forbes. 
I know you're up here, I can hear you. 
(rustling) VINCENT: He's teaching class. 
I need you to step out where I can see you. 
Sir, I'm not going to ask you again. 
(quietly): Okay. 
You're Vincent Keller. 
You look pretty good for a dead guy. 
I did not kill that woman. 
And I didn't mention a murder, but since you brought it up... 
...why were your prints 
at the Webster crime scene? 
Look, I was out driving. 
I saw her collapse. 
She hit her head, she needed help. 
So you followed her into the hotel? 
I tried to resuscitate her. 
You gave her CPR. 
You're a doctor. 
She had been poisoned. 
How would you know that? 
(phone buzzing) Your phone. 
Hey, has tox come back on the Webster case yet? 
Our telepathy is working. 
Positive for lethal doses of nicotine. 
Cat, I just gave you cause of death. 
Yeah, that's great. 
Okay. 
I got to go. 
I'll see you at the cinema at 9:00, yeah? 
Yeah, sounds good. 
(phone beeps off) How'd you know she was poisoned if you didn't kill her? 
I have a good sense of smell. 
You can smell poison? 
Look, I did not hurt her, okay? 
But you were a witness. 
Look, I need your help. 
There was hair found on the body, matches DNA from an old murder case. 
That night did you see anything? 
Why do you have that? 
I need to know why you have that. 
I... 
TESS: Catherine. 
No one can know I'm here. 
Why? 
Why does everybody need to think you're dead? 
Please, you know I did not hurt that woman. 
TESS: NYPD. 
Please. 
We're not done here. 
NYPD. 
Hey. 
It's all clear. 
What the hell are you doing? 
You were right, there's nothing here. 
Come on, let's go. 
Come on. 
Hi, this is Detective Catherine Chandler, NYPD. 
I need to speak to Special Agent Hernandez. 
Transferred when? 
Joe's waiting for an update. 
Two minutes. 
Okay, then who can I speak to about a case he covered nine years ago? 
All right, nicotine, when ingested, kills in seconds. 
Security footage is longer than that, so it must have been absorbed through her skin, in which case it can take two to four hours to work. 
So where was she during that period of time? 
We checked her date book, hard drive-- no appointments, she wasn't at work. 
Great, great, great, so we are nowhere. 
I can't wait to tell the DA. 
(distantly): How's our dead vet fit in? 
  (distantly): Hello. 
Cat. 
(normal voice): Dead vet how's he fit in? 
He doesn't. 
Well, you were suspicious enough to execute a search. 
Dead, not dead this isn't an identity case. 
We need to focus on finding the source of the poison. 
Ashley was a fashion editor. 
You want to kill her, you probably don't do it with window cleaner. 
Then, what do you do it with? 
WOMAN: Do you really think Ashley was poisoned by something that came from the beauty closet? 
Ms. London, we're trying to 
figure out what happened, and since you're the beauty editor... 
That is a hair product, not a body lotion. 
Does everyone get their samples from the beauty closet? 
If they're nice to me. 
They sign them out? 
And log it. 
Do you have any idea how much these stuff costs? 
So Ashley Webster being promoted over you, doesn't sound too nice. 
Okay, we're done here. 
Ms. London... 
CHLOE: I don't mean to be rude, I have an editorial meeting that started five minutes ago. 
This is Ashley's office. 
It's the executive editor's office. 
Oh, so you got that promotion after all. 
Not the way I wanted it. 
Look, I may not have loved Ashley, but I didn't kill her. 
(knocking on glass) Now if you'll excuse me, I have an issue to get out. 
I trust the two of you can find your own way out? 
Yeah, we sure can. 
It's Ashley's stuff. 
Pregnancy test. 
There's two missing. 
So Ashley was pregnant? 
Autopsy wouldn't have caught it if it was early enough. 
Husband didn't seem like he knew. 
Maybe it wasn't his. 
So maybe she was cheating, husband found out? 
(phone ringing) Chandler. 
This is Special Agent McCleary, FBI. 
You called about a contaminated DNA sample linked to the murder case of Vanessa Chandler? 
Yeah, I was hoping we could meet up? 
(man speaks indistinctly over P.A.) 
Detective Chandler. 
Agent McCleary. 
I appreciate you doing this. 
Hope it wasn't too out of your way. 
Well, I wouldn't want to be the reason you were late for your son's birthday. 
(chuckling) Did you bring it with you? 
I did. 
The analysis looks corrupted, but the numbers are identical. 
Well, we'll take a look. 
(blade snicks) (grunting) (Catherine cries out) (yelling) (man cries out) (music playing through earbuds):  Just call me angel   Ah, ah   Just touch my cheek before you leave me...  
(both groaning) (grunting) (yelling) (pained grunt) (growling, Catherine gasps) (blows landing, grunting) (grunting) (man screaming) (gun clatters) Hey! 
Hey, I know you're down here! 
Come out, come out! 
Hey! 
Come out here! 
I know you're here! 
I know you can see me! 
(horn sounding) (horn blaring) You're him. 
So, are we gonna talk about it? 
You need to keep this clean and dry. 
Avoidance. 
One of my favorite techniques. 
How about a drink? 
Can you drink? 
Not such a good idea. 
Maybe not for you. 
Look, my roommate is home... 
Hey, I-I-I promise that I will be quiet. 
It's just... 
three people did just try to kill me, and, uh... 
you killed two of them. 
I think we got beer. 
Great. 
It's just a hobby. 
Here. 
Um, yeah, my mom, she... 
she used to have this stuff lying around, too. 
She's the one, nine years ago. 
So, um, what happened to you? 
Did someone do this to you? 
(faint voices echoing) I should've asked questions. 
(faint voices echoing) Any word from your brothers? 
They're still trying to get everyone out. 
(echoes): They're still trying to get everyone out. 
But I was too angry. 
Confused. 
So you enlisted. 
Yeah. 
(closing door echoes) Once I got over there, I was tapped. 
They told me that I had the chance to be part of something great, that I could make a difference. 
It was called Operation Muirfield. 
They told us they were vitamins, antibiotics, steroids that would protect us. 
What were they? 
Like I said, I should've asked questions. 
All I know is that they changed our DNA. 
(automatic gunfire) They made us stronger, faster... better. 
They heightened our reflexes, our senses. 
That's why you could smell the poison. 
Yeah. 
But something went wrong. 
Anytime the adrenaline kicked in, we became monsters. 
They couldn't stop us. 
We couldn't stop us. 
So they gave orders to shut it down, to eradicate us all. 
(chopper blades whirring) (men shouting) (explosion) How did you survive? 
Luck. 
(wry laugh) So... all of this... 
for an antidote. 
It doesn't work. 
You've just been hiding out here? 
Yeah. 
JT's the only one I can trust. 
Except you, you go out there and you save people. 
No. 
No... 
you do. 
You saved me, and you tried to save Ashley Webster. 
I guess it reminds me of who I used to be. 
A doctor? 
Human. 
You should probably leave now. 
Vincent, that night nine years ago, why were you there... 
I already told you more than I should. 
That agent on the platform was from Muirfield, okay? 
You're on their radar. 
Why? 
Vincent, does this have something to do with my mom? 
I don't know anything about your mom. 
I'm sorry, okay? 
But you can not come back here. 
It is too dangerous for the both of us. 
No, I just... 
Just go. 
Go. 
TESS: There you are. 
I've been calling and calling you. 
Were you with Zeke? 
What? 
That glow. 
What glow? 
The sex glow. 
It's all over your face. 
I don't have a glow. 
I'm just excited. 
I found the murder weapon. 
Evan said he went through everything. 
It's what's not here that's important. 
Look, the sign-out sheet. 
Ashley signed out four products the day before she died. 
Our guys only found three. 
Killer probably took the fourth. 
So someone put poison in Ashley's True to Color Blonde? 
CATHERINE: Hey, Evan, any way to tell if that nicotine was absorbed through Taylor's scalp? 
I'll check her hair follicles. 
You do realize that I waited for hours and hours last night? 
This one stood me up. 
Oh, my God, the premiere. 
Movie was lousy. 
Good swag bag. 
Then I got called into here. 
My guys found these in the power couple's bed. 
Oh. Bedbugs? 
That rash I showed you was actually bites. 
Since these things are little bloodsuckers, they carry the DNA of whoever's been rolling around in those sheets. 
Your vic wasn't pregnant. 
It was the hubby that was stepping out. 
Can those mini vampires tell us who with? 
Sorry, ladies, we're not open yet. 
Actually, I'm Detective Chandler, and this is Detective Vargas. 
TESS: Alex's proofs from the night his wife died that was you. 
You were having an affair with him. 
Alex told me not to say anything. 
He said it would just make me look guilty, especially 'cause of the prenup. 
What prenup? 
If he cheats, he loses everything. 
But I didn't kill her, I swear. 
CATHERINE: It's not just this hostess. 
We have bedbug DNA... 
Hey! 
...from four other women. 
I'm eating here! 
Alex Webster had access to the poison, and he had motive-- the prenup. 
Except there was no prenup. 
I just read the forensic accounting report. 
If he wanted out, all he had to do was file for divorce. 
Now, if you will excuse me, I have some FBI nonsense to deal with. 
(clears throat) Sir. 
What's going on? 
I don't know. 
Bodies from the subway. 
VINCENT: The agents on the platform were from Muirfield. You 
are on their radar. 
It is too dangerous for the both of us. 
Don't see you guys out here very often. 
What's the occasion? 
Just following orders, Detective. 
Of course, we're gonna need to take that back. 
Of course. Just making sure 
you're not stealing our case. 
Detective Chandler. 
VINCENT: Hey. 
(gasps) Oh, my God, you scared me. 
You're the one snooping around my place. 
Hey, some military guys just showed up. 
They took the agents from the platform away. 
You didn't talk to them, did you? 
No. I asked them 
what they were doing, and I came straight here. 
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have done that. 
I wasn't followed. 
I needed to warn you. 
Look, you need to leave. 
No. Listen to me. Look, 
I lost my phone on the platform. 
What if the Muirfield people have it, and they know about you? 
This is why you have to stop all contact with me. 
What about my mom? 
I know what it's like to lose someone you love, but you need to move on. 
You can't tell me to just move on! 
Well, so what? You'll solve 
your mother's murder, exact justice? Trust me, 
it does not end well. 
Well, I'm gonna take my chances. 
You don't get it, do you?! 
No, I do! 
You can't tell me everything, and that's fine. 
I don't need all the answers, but last night that was the first time since my mom died that I haven't felt crazy. 
(inhales deeply) You are crazy showing up here alone! 
I could kill you in less than a second! Now go! 
(roars): Go! 
(panting) CATHERINE: Last night, I realized that I was thinking about your wife's case the wrong way. 
Sometimes things aren't what they seem. 
You can't tell who the real monsters are. 
I didn't kill my wife. 
We just spoke to a woman you're having an affair with, and I have DNA that proves there are at least four others. 
You made every one of your women fall in love with you and think that the only thing standing in the way of their fairy tale ending was some pretend prenup. 
Mr. Webster, 
I don't think you killed your wife. 
But you are the reason she's dead. 
I need a list of names. 
Everyone you slept with during your marriage. 
You owe it to Ashley. 
Hey. 
Are you looking for Chloe? 
I'm her new assistant. 
Actually, Emily, uh, we want to talk to you. 
CATHERINE: Look, we appreciate how helpful you've been, but you forgot to mention one thing. 
Alex. 
Alex? 
Alex Webster-- you were having an affair with him. 
TESS: The missing pregnancy tests-- we assumed they were Ashley's, but you used them, didn't you? 
That's why you had saltines in your purse. 
I don't know what you're... 
The sign-out sheet. 
I'm pretty sure if we showed this to an expert, they'd confirm that this was you signing out Ashley's True to Color Blond. 
No. Uh, Chloe ran the closet... 
You wanted us to think it was her so that you could run off into the sunset with Alex. 
But there was no prenup. 
That's impossible. 
He lied. Just 
like he lied to all his women, including the one that he was with the night that you killed Ashley. 
I'm not even pregnant anymore. 
I lost it. 
You tell us where the bottle is, we'll make sure that the DA knows how remorseful you are. 
(distant siren wailing) Are we okay? 
You've been having secret conversations, you executed that search without me, and my brother's investigating the subway case... 
he found this on the platform. 
What were you doing on the F train? 
All right, just forget it. 
Just know I'm here, no judgments, you ever want to talk. 
Hey, it's Devil and Prada. 
Nice work. 
Hey, as long as I get to be Devil. 
So I'm not letting you celebrate your big case alone at your father's engagement party. 
What's the dress code? 
Evan, you don't have to do that. 
Oh, come on. Free 
drinks, and I'm assuming your vapid stepmother insisted on a good caterer. 
You're just doing this out of... 
Charity. Yeah, 
poor little single girl. 
Did Tess tell you about Zeke? 
No, Joe did. 
How does Joe know? 
(laughs) I don't know. 
But I wouldn't ask him now. 
He's just found out the department has to shell out for a new spectrometer. 
Yeah, I took a look over some old cases. 
Six more samples, all with the same corrupted DNA. 
Six. Really? 
Yeah, so I guess we'll see what's what once we get our new spectrometer. 
Maybe you weren't so crazy after all. 
Right there. 
What are you gonna do? 
Check. 
(footsteps approaching) Hi. 
Hi. 
Hi? 
H-Hi? 
Did I miss something, or...? 
JT, you mind? 
Wow. 
Just, you look... 
I have an engagement party. 
Right. 
Look, I know you're gonna try to kick me out. I get it. 
I-I get what it's like to hide out and push people away 'cause you don't feel deserving. 
Do you know why I keep asking about my mom? 
Because I'm the reason that she's dead. 
If I hadn't left the stupid vanity mirror open... 
But, Vincent, I just found six cases of you trying to save victims around the city. 
You're not a monster. 
I would know. 
There are a lot of guys out there that are, but... 
You saved my life. 
Twice. 
Catherine, wait. 
You're not the reason your mom's dead. 
They were tracking her. 
I'm not sure why, but it wasn't your fault. 
(gasps) CATHERINE: Sometimes it feels like everyone's moved on, but they all miss you in their own way. 
 And the arms of the ocean are carrying me...  
Mom, there's not a day that goes by when I don't think about you. 
The good news is... 
I know now I'm not crazy. 
I was saved by a beast. 
He didn't get there in time to save you, but he's still out there. 
And I have a feeling that now, we're going to have to save each other. 
 Never let me go, never let me go   Never let me go, never let me go   Never let me go, never let me go...

I'll keep an eye out. 
I like your necklace. 
You and I are the same. 
We have to fight to get what we want. 
Don't come back without the job. 
I get the feeling like the dead won't stay dead. 
Don't. 
Don't what? 
Don't let him out. 
Write 1,500 words on this Kandinsky. 
A lethal enforcer of the Russian mafia... 
The story I wrote. 
It isn't true. I made it up. 
Aah! 
No! Help me, please! 
Let's see what the great Annie Morgan has written for us today. 
"A ruthless figure of the Russian mafia, "Mr. Kandinsky has eluded 
law enforcement "in several countries. 
It's been years since anyone has seen his face." 
I was under the radar for 20 years, then I see this article you wrote in the newspaper. 
Somebody talked to you. 
I swear, nobody talked. 
Okay? 
I know this sounds crazy. 
Uh, I made it up. 
I made you up and I-I didn't know that it would come true. 
Please. You have to... 
okay, uh, please. 
I'll retract the story. 
Can't you just let me go and... 
You have pretty eyes. 
Such a shame to cut one out. 
No, please. I am... I am telling 
you the truth, okay? Nobody... 
shh. No good idea to move. 
Messy. 
It was my boss Ned! 
Ned Shifley! He was the source! 
Your friend better give me answer or I come back and cut out both your eyes. 
How should I wear my hair tomorrow night? 
Up? Down? Beehive? 
Mohawk? Henry? For the party 
at the mayor's house? 
Huh? 
Okay, where's your head at? 
What's wrong with you? 
I just got an e-mail from councilman Edwards canceling my interview out of nowhere. 
And, like, I thought we really bonded. I... 
oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry. 
Listen, you are amazing, and there are gonna be so many amazing opportunities for you in this city. 
This one just... 
it wasn't meant to be. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
You make me forget about it. 
Whoa! Oh. 
What is that? 
Uh, I found a locked suitcase in the basement. 
It's cool, right? 
How many boyfriend points do I lose if I say no? 
At least ten. 
And I may be forced to wear my hillbilly teeth to the party tomorrow night. 
Well, I love those. 
And for the record, I love your old suitcase. 
Come on. Aren't you at least 
a little curious as to what might be inside? 
I'm guessing dust mites. 
You're no fun. 
And you're late. Come on. 
I'm not late. 
Come in. 
Hello? 
Olivia, hi. 
Sorry to drop by unannounced. 
I'm breaking one of Emily post's cardinal rules. 
No. You're safe with me. 
Please. 
Um, can I get you, uh, coffee, water, sparkling water? Nothing. Thank you. 
I'll just be a minute. 
Well, is something wrong? 
The Drake thief. 
Tony just informed me that he struck again. 
We need to get rid of him, Jane. 
Hire a Detective, install cameras, whatever you need to do. 
Just find him or her. 
It's bad for the building. 
I'll do my best. 
I mean, I would love to get my grandmother's necklace back. 
And I'd like to get my diamond brooch back, too. 
Whoever it is, I want 'em out. 
Oh, and, uh, by the way, tomorrow at the mayor's house? 
There'll be a lot of powerful players. 
Big opportunity for Henry. 
Which means I need to look the part of an important guy's girlfriend. Got it. 
What would you say if I told you I bought a vintage Dolce & Gabbana at a consignment store for 90% off? 
I'd say you're learning. 
 so come on, honey, blow yourself to pieces   come on, honey, give yourself completely   And do it all although you can't believe it   youth knows no pain  Youth knows no pain Hey, Ingrid. Come on in. 
Good morning, Nona. 
Mmm. Something smells good 
in here. 
Uh, my grandma baked them before she left. 
Oh, she's... 
She's not gonna be here? Again? 
She's super sorry. 
You know how it is at her age. 
Another sick friend. 
Well, let's get started then. 
I've really reached a new level of calm in my life. 
Calm. Peace. 
It's pretty beautiful. 
I'd say I'm just about cured. 
Cured? 
So you don't need me anymore? 
Nothing personal. 
I think I'd like to schedule a session when your grandmother is around. 
You know, I'd really like to get her take on how things are going. Okay? 
Sure. Uh, we'll set it up 
as soon as we can. 
You know that I'm just... 
I'm just trying to help you, right? 
What's the latest on the councilman Edwards deal? 
Well, you'll be happy to know that he officially blew me off. 
I know you think that job wasn't right for me anyway. 
His lack of taste proves my point. 
Have you thought about what I said? 
Maybe running for office yourself one day? 
Just every second of every minute. 
I mean, look, it's a great fantasy, but right now, I have to focus on the job I actually have. 
Listen, Henry, there's something you should know. 
Your office has me under investigation. 
What are you talking about? 
I'd heard rumors, but this morning I got confirmation from my lawyer. 
They're saying I've gotten inside information on several land deals. 
Gavin, I-I had no idea. 
It's nothing to worry about. 
Of course. It's probably coming 
from one of my competitors on the Greenpoint towers deal. 
Some people will do anything for a piece of land. 
Well, maybe I can talk to Commissioner Pike about... 
I won't have you putting yourself in the middle and I certainly don't hold you responsible for your boss' actions. 
I appreciate that. 
What's important is that we don't let this little bit of unpleasantness affect our relationship. 
Help me! 
Aah! 
Oh, my God. 
Hey, Nona. 
Cool sunglasses. 
Thanks. 
Thanks. 
Oh, just the girl I was looking for. 
Did I leave my sunglasses in your apartment? 
Uh, no. Definitely not. 
Maybe you dropped them outside. 
And the Drake thief strikes again. 
We don't know that. Hi. I'm... 
I'm Jane, the building manager. 
Hi. Ingrid Weissman. I'm, um... 
A.K.A. My shrink. 
Oh. Everybody in New York 
is in therapy, right? 
Daddy issues. Twice a week. 
So what do your sunglasses look like? I'll keep an eye out. 
Oh, right, they're, uh, they're black and round. 
They have two "c's" on the side. 
Let me give you my card. 
If you find them. Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Let me walk you out. 
ned? 
ned, are you there? 
ned, it's an emergency! 
Oh, please pick up. 
Please pick up. 
Please pick up. Please pick up. 
ned? 
Oh. 
Oh, God. 
Oh! 
Hello? 
I had fun with your friend. 
You're a very bad girl. 
You lied. 
You're next. 
Hey, Nona. Uh, I was wondering 
if I could speak to your grandmother, please. 
Sorry. She's at A.C. 
Atlantic City. 
Oh. She takes the old 
people party bus and plays slots all day. 
Well, maybe you can help me. 
Uh, do you recognize any of this stuff? 
Uh, nope. 
Okay. Hand it over. 
All of it, including my grandmother's necklace. 
You're saying I took all this? 
Yeah. Next time you want to hide 
your criminal activity, don't wear the evidence. 
I'll tell you what. 
I'll just set a meeting with you, me, your grandmother, and Olivia Doran, and we can all just talk about it then. Okay. 
Jane, wait. Don't leave. 
I didn't take your necklace. 
Really? 
I swear, I didn't. 
But, you know, maybe I have some of the other stuff. 
Henry. 
Commissioner Pike. 
Come inside. 
Somebody wants to meet you. 
Sure. 
Henry, this is A.D.A. Regina Wilson. 
She's gonna ask you a couple of questions. 
About what? 
You're familiar with the, uh, Alpern deal, Mr. Martin? 
Sure. Uh, yeah. 
The site turned out to be next to a toxic waste dump. 
And you were aware of its status at the time of sale? 
Yes. And did you share this 
knowledge with anyone? 
No. Gavin Doran bought the 
land and turned right around and sold it to a group of Chinese investors overnight, hours before the environmental report became public. 
Rumor has it you two are besties. 
I've done nothing illegal or unethical. 
We have hundreds of these. 
At dinner at their apartment... 
You were the last person that Gavin Doran saw before he sold the property. 
You had me followed? 
We're having him followed. 
You happened to be there. 
Doran has somebody in this office, and it appears to be you. 
You will lose everything... 
your job, your reputation. 
You will be disbarred. 
Unless I'm innocent. 
I'm innocent. 
You have access to Doran. 
You could obtain the kind of documentation that would put him in a cell right next to his good friend Bernie Madoff. 
Whatever it is you're asking me to do, I won't do it. 
Take a day. Think about it. 
We don't want to ruin you. 
But we will. 
Shh! 
He'll hear me. 
Who? 
Please. 
Tell me. 
You and Jane will not take the subway to the mayor's tomorrow night. 
You will ride with us. 
Defy her at your peril. 
I think, um, I think Jane actually wanted to go to dinner first. 
So we'll have to get back to you on that. 
I'll leave you two. 
Whatever you're working yourself up to say, I'm guessing it's not good news. 
Gavin, I so appreciate everything you've done for me and Jane, especially me. 
This sounds like the beginning of a break-up speech. 
I just think that we probably shouldn't socialize until the investigation is over. 
Oh, that's what's bothering you? 
I assure you, there is nothing to worry about. 
Gavin, in my position, even the appearance of impropriety... 
Pike got in your head. 
Gavin... 
do you believe this investigation is anything more than a charade? 
I'm sure, but... 
Commissioner Pike is manipulating you. 
He's using you to get to me. 
Bringing down the great Gavin Doran would skyrocket his career. 
I don't think that's what this is about. 
Are you aware that your boss has been lining his pockets with developers' dollars for years? 
It's the worst-kept secret in Manhattan. 
That's funny. You've never 
said that before. 
I didn't want to put you in a bad spot, Henry. 
Gavin, why have you been so nice to me and Jane? 
We're nobodies. 
Because I see something in you, something I haven't seen for a long time. 
The gifts, the flattery, V.I.P. Access to all New York 
has to offer... 
at what point do you expect me to start paying you back? 
Now you're insulting me. 
You wanted me to tell you that Alpern land was next to a toxic waste dump. 
I do my own research, and that includes getting soil analysis of any property I bid on. 
It was a test. 
Sit down, Henry. Have a drink. 
I'm such an idiot. 
Careful, Henry. 
You walk through that door, things change. 
I know you have a plan for Henry, but maybe it's time to cut him loose. 
If it comes to it, I'll do what I have to do. 
Hey. 
Jane, from the... the Drake. 
Oh, right. Hi. 
Oh. I-I found your glasses. 
Someone turned them in to lost and found. 
Really? That's great. 
That's great. Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Thanks. 
Was, uh, was there something I can help you with? 
Uh, yeah, yeah, I... 
I wanted to ask about Nona. 
I can't discuss a patient with you. 
No, I-I don't want to know her secrets. 
I just... 
I want to know more. 
All right, here's what I can say. 
A year and a half ago, there was an accident, and both of Nona's parents were killed. 
I didn't know. 
Now you know. 
And from what I can tell, her grandmother is never around, so she's practically raising herself. 
Listen, I-I-I lost my mom young, and, you know, my dad wasn't exactly around, so... 
I get what she's going through. 
She just needs someone that she can trust, and it's not gonna be me... 
But maybe it can be you. 
Gavin, thank goodness. 
I need your help. 
I wrote a story about this man, Kandinsky, and I-I mean, I made him up, and now he's trying to kill me. 
He already... he... he already... 
he... he killed my editor, 
and it's all my fault. 
You wanted to change the world with your voice. 
That's a... 
Noble ambition. 
I can make Kandinsky go away, but I'll need you to write one final article... 
a piece about the corrupt city planning Commissioner. 
No, I-I don't want to do it again. 
I don't want anyone else to die. 
I promise no innocent lives will be lost if you write this piece. 
I can tell you everything you need to know. 
I'll even give you a headline. 
And Kandinsky will never bother you again. 
Tony, I'll be back in a few hours. 
Have our car outside at 7:00. 
Uh, Mrs. D. 
Mrs. D., wait. 
Jane discovered the thief. 
Uh, no. 
I came back from a delivery, and there was a whole bag of stuff just sitting behind my desk. 
Been playing Santa claus all afternoon. 
Well then. 
Keep up the good work. 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Completely understand. 
Uh, next week? 
Oh, hold on. 
Let me check my calendar. 
Yeah. 
So what do you think? This one? 
Henry? 
Uh, yeah, it looks great. 
Mm. 
I miss my grandmother's necklace. 
Have you ever met Nona's grandma? 
You know, I worry about her. 
She's so different. 
You know, she reminds me of me when I was 14 and really pissed at the world and really, really lonely. 
Henry? 
Are you okay? 
Yes. Everything is great. 
Everything is so great... 
Including that necklace. 
Baby, how about we skip out on this shindig and we go watch the game somewhere? 
Well, now I know something's wrong. 
You wanted to go to the mayor's house since I met you. 
I'm kidding. 
I wouldn't miss tonight for the world. 
And you look beautiful. 
Okay. 
Babe, we're gonna be late. 
Hey. Hey. 
Hey. 
I guess she told you I'm the notorious Drake thief. 
Actually, no, she didn't. 
Oh. 
And I won't. 
I won't tell anybody as long as nothing else goes missing. 
Thanks. 
You're welcome. 
Whoa. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
All right. 
I'll, uh, I'll get a cab. 
Keep Henry away from the man with the compass tattoo. 
He has a gun. 
He's dangerous, Jane. 
He's gonna hurt Henry. 
Nona, what's going on? 
What are you talking about? 
Just do it. 
I feel like I should curtsy. 
That makes two of us. Let's go. 
Oh. I'll take one of those. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Hey. Relax. 
It's just the mayor. 
Okay. Let's go eat free food. 
Yes. 
Yes? 
It's done. 
"City planning Commissioner investigated, ties to mob." 
I just sent it to my editor. 
Good girl. 
You will never see Kandinsky again. 
I promise. 
Henry. 
Hello. 
No need to respond. 
We might be under observation. 
Gavin, I'm not going to apologize for caring that my behavior be above reproach. 
Above reproach. 
Right. 
You forgot this. 
Jane, I think, uh... 
Hey, Henry, check out the prime photo op. 
Okay. Maybe later. 
Olivia, will you please tell my boyfriend that having his photo taken with the mayor does not make him a fan boy? 
You have gall showing up here. 
My husband has gone out of his way to open doors for you. 
Olivia... and you take the 
word of a crook over his? 
Sorry. 
H-have I missed something? 
Henry is aiding his boss in an investigation of Gavin. 
Oh, well, I'm... I'm sure 
there's been some mistake. 
Yeah. 
A big one. 
Babe, I'm sorry. 
I didn't want to worry you. 
Okay, well, I'm... I'm worried, 
Henry. I'm definitely worried. 
I understand. 
Commissioner Pike brought in the A.D.A. 
They started questioning me. 
They... they were accusing me 
of giving inside information to Gavin. 
Why? 
Leverage. 
They want me to help them take down Gavin. 
Okay, but you think Gavin's innocent, right? 
I thought so. 
And now I'm not sure. 
He's saying that Pike is dirty. 
Pike is saying that he's dirty. 
Okay. Okay. 
What are you gonna do? 
I don't know. 
I don't know. 
They can spin my relationship with Gavin any way they want. 
Forget about the mayor's office. 
I'll be back in Indiana zoning strip malls. 
No, you can't let them... 
any of them... intimidate you. 
That's easier said than done. 
I don't care what zip code we come from. 
You're your own man. 
Don't you forget it. 
I decided I need the twinkies. 
Comfort food. 
Hmm. I read your article. 
That Commissioner is seriously in trouble. 
Yeah, he'll... 
he'll probably go to jail. 
No way the mob's gonna let him get nabbed by the cops. 
He'd flip on them. 
So what, do you... 
Do you think they'll kill him? 
And they'll probably use your guy to do it. 
Kandinsky. 
Oh, my God. 
What have I done? 
Excuse me. 
Do we have something to talk about? 
We do. 
I have Gavin's file. 
We have to do something about Henry. 
It's already done. 
Cooperating with us is a smart move. 
You won't regret it. 
But I decided I'm not gonna look at it and neither are you. 
I'm not gonna compromise myself for anyone, including my boss. 
I thought you had ambition. 
I do. 
High horses and city politics don't mix, Henry. 
I'll make this very bad for you. 
You will lose everything. 
Not everything. 
Hey. Let me through, please. 
Uh, I have to warn him. 
You're fired. 
Gavin was right. 
You're a crook. 
Oh! Excuse me. 
Henry! 
Get down! 
Get down! Everyone, get down! 
 He's got a gun! 
  He has a gun! 
Oh, my God! 
She's been shot. 
Oh. Evening, folks. 
Uh, Tony, I don't know if you heard the news, but Annie Morgan was shot tonight, and... she didn't make it. 
That's... that's awful. 
What happened? 
I don't know. 
We don't know the details. 
It looks like an attempted mob hit. 
She was an innocent bystander. 
Poor kid. 
Yeah. 
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get the image of her out of my mind. 
Excuse us. 
You two go ahead. 
Jane and I will get the next one. 
You were right. 
Pike got in my head. 
I'm sorry I doubted you. 
You're young. It's hard to know 
who you can trust. 
Not anymore. 
Gavin, I know you're looking out for me, and I appreciate that more than I can say. 
Purely selfish on my part. 
I like hitching my wagon to a rising star. 
Tonight is another reminder. 
We can't take anything in this life for granted. 
You must be proud of Henry. 
You must think I'm an idiot for not knowing what was going on with him. 
Naive, yes. Idiot, no. 
Anyway, you sussed out the Drake thief. 
Well, um, not exactly. 
Um, the stuff just showed up. 
I get the feeling you're protecting someone. 
I assume you have your reasons and I'll let it go at that. 
Thank you for everything. 
Uh, it's kinda late, isn't it? 
I wanted you to know. 
Henry's fine. 
Okay. 
It all happened, Nona. 
Whatever you saw or felt... 
Whoa. Okay. No clue 
what you're talking about. 
You saved Henry's life. 
I saw the compass tattoo. 
You knew Henry was in danger. 
Sleep it off, Jane. 
You'll feel better in the morning. 
You're special. 
I know being different can be scary, but I want you to know if you ever need to talk to anyone about anything... 
I'm here. 
I shouldn't have warned her. 
I should've kept my mouth shut. 
But I couldn't. 
I actually think... 
I think I can trust her, grandma. 
And maybe she can help you. 
Hey. 
You should have told me you were in trouble. 
You're right. 
You're right. I should've. 
I just... 
I wanted to protect you. 
We're supposed to protect each other. 
You're right. 
 Still  falling  Breathless and on  again  inside Thank you. 
I was right about Henry. 
He's a hero. 
And so all's forgiven? 
Everybody's allowed to make a mistake. 
Once. 
Steinberg called. 
Based on the impending indictment of Commissioner Pike, the investigation into me has been suspended. 
Sometimes I forget you can do magic. 
It's easy... 
When I have a lucky charm. 
 Turning  into dust  like two strangers  turning into dust  Till my hand shook  with the way  I fear Tonight you shouted my name. 
How did you know something was wrong? 
I just... 
I looked up and happened to see his gun. 
I guess when it comes to you, I must have a sixth sense. 
﻿1 Nice digs. 
We have an interview... 
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen. 
For the manager position. 
I want the Drake restored to its original glory, and I want you to do it. 
She's how we get Henry. 
Someone covered up a door right here. 
Whoever covered this door with concrete might've had a good reason to do it. 
I still want you to demo that wall. 
You need to leave. 
It's the price we pay... 
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane. 
For the thing we want the most. 
Somebody? 
Oh, God. 
Come on! 
Damn it! 
Let us out. 
Hello?! Can somebody hear me?! 
Help! 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't die. 
Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. 
Hello?! 
Can anybody hear me?! 
Is somebody in here? 
Go. 
Go away. 
Who is that? 
Damn it. 
Hello? 
 Henry! Henry! 
 Jane! There you are! 
I've been looking all over for you. 
Henry, there's somebody in there. Okay? 
 What? 
 A little girl. She grabbed my leg. 
 In there? 
 Yes! 
 Come on. You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Be careful. 
 Hello? 
Hello? Is anyone in here? 
Hello? 
Baby, there's nobody in here. 
Are you sure it wasn't one of the dolls? 
No! I-I know what I saw, Henry. 
H-her voice. I heard her voice. 
Wait, wait, wait. Shh. 
I bet you can hear things through this air vent. 
It's okay. 
Oh, my God. It felt so real. 
I was so scared. 
You're okay. All right? You're okay. 
Why don't we go upstairs... listen... 
where it's warm and cozy, and the only person who'll be grabbing you is me? 
All right? 
You're okay, baby. 
Okay. Let's go. Come on. 
Do you think I'm crazy? 
Yeah. 
Corrections by wilson0804 Do you have any idea how sick I am of dead people? 
Well, at least the job's half done. 
Their story's already been told. 
All you have to do is type it up. 
That is the point. 
There's no challenge in writing obituaries. 
You know, they're... they're 
like classifieds for the dead. 
You know, every time I see you, Annie, you say the same thing. 
So tell me, what do you want to write? 
Stories that matter, that have consequences. 
I mean, I went to school to be a real journalist. 
My mom toiled at children's stories for 20 years. 
Yeah, she never published, but... 
At least she wrote from the heart. 
Oh! I meant to ask about Louise. 
How's she feeling? 
Great. It's amazing, actually. 
One good night of rest back at the Drake, and it's like all of her pain went away. 
Good. I was worried about her. 
Uh, you think it'll be okay if I stop by later and say hi? 
Yeah, yeah. She'd love to see you. 
Great. See ya. 
Annie. 
How is life out on the beat? 
Wouldn't know. None of 
my subjects have pulses. 
That sounds like the gallows humor of an obituary writer. 
And I thought I'd lost my sense of humor. 
Going that well? 
Honestly, Gavin, I would do anything to get off the obit desk. 
But you're very funny and creative. 
Well, you should tap into that. 
Those are two qualities not encouraged in my line of work. 
Well, maybe I can do something to help. 
Tap into my creativity, huh, Gavin? 
Well, Mr. Diebold, 
you may not have lived well, but... 
I can make sure you die well. 
"After the Cold War, "Mr. Diebold worked covert operations 
"for the CIA, tracking rogue Soviet agents. 
"Among them, "the former KGB enforcer"... 
"Kandinsky." 
"A true American hero, Mr. Diebold's death will 
be mourned by thousands." 
Morning. 
Hey. 
How you feeling? 
Better. 
Actually... better than better. 
Does that recovery include, uh, all body parts? 
Well, there is only one way to find out. 
Did you hear something? 
What? 
It sounded like the front door. 
Louise, you ready to go? Whoa! 
Sorry. 
Um... the door was open. 
I knocked. I guess you didn't hear me. 
Louise, I-I thought we had a yoga class. 
Um, we do. 
I-I zoned. I'm sorry. 
W-wait. She... she just 
barges in here and... 
You don't think that's a little bit invasive? 
Stop. She's keeping my life 
together right now, okay? 
Without her, I would be screwed. 
Yeah, that was the idea. 
Can you imagine the secrets buried in there? 
The architect totally missed the room even though he mapped out all of the duct work that went through there. 
Come see this. 
I suppose that means you want me to walk over there? 
Well, if you wanna pretend you're interested, it will help sell it. 
See this duct work? 
It was probably used for an air conditioning unit. 
But a/c wasn't readily available until the 1950s, which means that this si... 
Someone did a renovation. 
Right? 'Cause if the Drake 
wasn't built till '23, then... what? I've been paying attention. 
I'm very impressed. 
I'm gonna talk to Gavin to see if he knows where the original plans are. 
Time out. Hold on. Hold on. 
Hey, you know, maybe somebody built that wall for a reason. 
 Okay. What reason? 
 I don't know. 
'Cause it was personal? 
'Cause maybe he wanted it to stay hidden 'cause... 
Maybe it's haunted? 
All right you making fun of me? Yes. 
Look, babe, everything is going great here. All right? 
Gavin's taking me to his club today... 
Yes, Henry. Everything 
is going great for you. 
And it's a very highly respected club, and there's nothing wrong with seeing how the high and mighty live. Okay? 
Jane, all I'm saying is, maybe it isn't the best idea to tell our landlord... your boss... 
that you're hammering down walls without his permission. 
But I do have permission. 
He told me to restore the Drake to its original design, and that is what I'm doing. 
Henry, the Drake is one big puzzle box. 
Okay, I wanna uncover every hidden treasure, every mystery in this place. 
If you were the owner, wouldn't you want to know? 
Good morning, Jane. 
Morning, Gavin. 
I, uh, I noticed the orchids throughout the building. 
Special occasion for you and Olivia? 
It's a memorial. 
Our daughter passed away ten years ago today. 
Oh, Gavin, I-I'm so sorry. I... 
I had no idea. 
How would you? 
Now to what do I owe the pleasure? 
It's not important. I can 
come back another time. 
What happened to our daughter's in the past, Jane. 
I'd prefer to focus on the future. 
Are those blueprints? 
Uh, yes. 
Well, as you know, uh, while preparing the Barlows' apartment for rent, I stumbled across a bird infestation. 
Uh, that led to the basement, which led to our exterminator sledgehammering down a wall. 
Carefully. 
And that led to the discovery of a hidden storage room. 
And? 
Well, uh... 
I was wondering if you had the original building plans, so I could continue looking around. 
What is it that you're hoping to find? 
Well, I-I don't know. 
Maybe the reason why someone wanted to bury the history of the Drake. 
That's a good idea, Jane. 
Maybe I have those old blueprints. 
Let me look for them. 
In the meantime, maybe you could do something for me. 
Um, of course. Anything. 
This day's always emotional for Olivia. 
Um, I would appreciate it if you could keep an eye on her. 
She's clearly taken to you. 
Well, uh, Gavin, I-I would be happy to help, but I'm not sure she would want me around. 
Well, she does prefer to be on her own, but she can get a little... 
Let's just say destructive. 
We all have our own ways of dealing with loss. 
What do you mean by "destructive"? 
Ahh. Hello, darling. 
Hello! Mwah. Mmm. 
Jane, how are you? 
I'm... I'm very well. Uh, 
Olivia, I was wondering if you were free for lunch. 
Oh. That's... a wonderful idea. 
I'll meet you downstairs in an hour, give you a chance to change your clothes. 
I really wish I had taken the subway. 
Excuse me, sir. Can we go any faster? 
All of Lexington is shut down for a funeral. 
Some diplomat's. 
For the funeral of Oscar Diebold, a CIA agent and Cold War hero who died yesterday at his home in Queens. 
Diebold was recruited by the CIA and became one of the agency's most respected operatives. 
 CIA director... 
 Oh, my God. 
 And federal judge Lawrence Wilkins says... 
 Oh, my God. 
He has nothing but respect for Diebold. 
He was the kind of... 
Gavin, I need to talk to you! 
Late for an appointment, Annie. 
Great piece this morning. 
But that story I wrote, it isn't true. 
Well, of course it is. I 
read it in the paper. 
No, G-Gavin, I made it up. 
Now, Annie, that man who died was an American hero. 
You want to take that away from him? 
From you? 
No. No. 
I got a good feeling, Annie. 
Things are gonna turn around for you. 
What is it you want, Henry? 
Right now? Some water. 
When someone asks about your future, if it's a joke to you, it's a joke to them. 
I wanna marry Jane. 
I'll wager that'll happen fairly soon. 
But the next time someone who's fairly connected asks what you want, my unsolicited advice is, don't lead with your love life. 
Aim higher. 
I wanna be Bill Edwards' chief of staff. 
Well, that's certainly more specific. 
He's a city councilman to the fifth Brooklyn district, right? 
Greenpoint. 
And I heard he's gonna take a shot at the mayor's office next election. 
You already work for the mayor. 
In city planning. 
I wasn't dreaming of city planning when I was a kid. 
So what was the kid's the dream? 
Be chief of staff to a city councilman? 
It's a step in the right direction. 
Actually, I have an interview in four weeks. 
The job will be gone in four weeks. 
You wanna make it in this town, Henry? 
You don't wait in line for your turn. 
There's no line. 
You gotta take what you want. 
You know, I-I think Henry always wanted to live in New York. 
He kind of harbors secret political ambitions, though... 
He'd never admit it. 
So you moved here for him? 
Well, for us. 
You know, my degree is in architecture but my heart is in historic preservation, and this city offers us everything. 
This restaurant is lovely. 
Ahh. I used to take Sasha here 
when she was a little girl. 
She'd get all dressed up in a smart suit, order a milkshake in a Martini glass... 
And tell me which men she thought were good enough to marry. 
Marry? Really? How old was she? 
7. 
"Precocious" doesn't quite do her justice. 
I'm sure you miss her very much. 
Ah. 
Thank you. Thanks. 
So you two seem to be getting along well. 
How's the sex with Henry? 
It's, uh, it's... 
Very nice. 
"Very nice" isn't always very nice. 
It's, uh, it's... 
Healthy. 
Our entire relationship. 
Well, except... 
Right now, he might think I'm a little crazy. 
Oh. That sounds juicy. 
Do tell. 
It... it's nothing. Uh, a misunderstanding. 
I don't want you thinking I'm crazy, too. 
Try me. 
Well, um... 
Since we moved into the Drake, I've been having these vivid dreams. 
Nightmares? 
No, more like visions. 
I'm... I'm not sure what's real. 
See, now you're looking at me that way, too. 
Oh. 
I'm not. 
Just... 
I get the feeling like, uh... 
The dead won't stay dead. 
Oh, Olivia, I'm so sorry. 
That was insensitive. I didn't mean Sasha. 
I.. 
Oh. Please. It happened a lot time ago. 
Jeffrey, another. 
Great piece last night, Annie. 
Oh. Thanks. 
And that Kandinsky? So creepy. 
Yeah. It just... really kinda wrote itself. 
It's a shame your mom isn't around to see it. 
She'd be so proud of you. 
Yeah. 
Hey, Jim, it's Annie in obits. 
I... yeah, I need to 
print a small retraction to a piece I wrote last month. 
Great. I'll send it over in a minute. 
Thanks. 
I love you, Mom. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
What is happened to me? 
Anything catch your eye? 
Uh, it all looks good. 
Off menu. 
First deputy mayor over my shoulder, D.A.'s just over there, 
and unless I'm mistaken, that is... 
That's councilman Edwards. 
Imagine your luck. 
What do you intend to do about it? 
U-uh... I don't know. 
I mean, I-I don't want to bother him. 
Are you rich, Henry? 
You got an uncle who's gonna leave you a nice nest egg? 
No. 
You and I are the same, you know? 
We come from nothing. 
We have to fight and claw to get what we want in this world. 
You like this club? 
Only way you'll ever come back here is as a guest, someone throws you a bone. 
Is that how you wanna live your life? 
Henry. 
Don't come back without the job. 
Excuse me, Mr. Edwards, I just 
wanted to introduce myself. 
My name is, uh, Henry Martin. 
Uh, we have an interview set up in a few weeks for the chief of staff position. 
Great. Guess I'll see you 
in a few weeks then, huh? 
I just wanna tell you you're gonna lose this upcoming election, sir. 
How's that? 
Because voters are mad about the rezoning in the Greenpoint district. 
They think you're in the developer's pocket. 
Meanwhile, the developers think you're too tough on environmental regulations. 
You wanna make a run at mayor someday? 
If you're not careful, Mr. Edwards, 
you're gonna be unemployed in six months. 
Why don't you have a seat? 
Thank you. 
Hey, uh, Tommy? Get him a drink, would you? 
What was your name? 
 Henry Martin.  
 Henry. 
Maybe you... you wanna slow down. 
Live a little, Jane. 
Olivia, why don't I drive? 
Why don't you just sit back and enjoy the ride? 
This is where it happened, ten years ago today, when Sasha died. 
Olivia, pull over and let's talk about this. 
It was raining, just a miserable night. 
She shouldn't have been driving. 
Olivia, slow down! 
Olivia! 
Olivia, there was nothing you could've done. 
It was an accident. 
No. 
She drove into that concrete wall on purpose. 
She wanted to die. 
Uh, Ned, you wanted to see me? 
Yeah. Come in and shut the door. 
You wanna tell me what's going on? 
I don't know what you mean. 
Well, since when does a 250-word obit turn into a 2-column expose on Cold War espionage? 
This Mr. Diebold story, it... 
it inspired me. 
Mm-hmm. I can't put my finger on it, Annie, 
but something's not right here. 
I talked to the editors upstairs about this. 
You know what they want me to do? 
Have you write 1,500 words on this Kandinsky guy. 
Deadline's tonight. Can you do it? 
Absolutely. 
Great. What do you have on him? 
Well, he was a very elusive character. 
Uh, he... 
Grew up just outside of Saint Petersburg in a tiny fishing village. 
Uh, he became a hired gun after the Cold War. 
Oh. Rumor has it he slipped 
through the border and was living in Canada. 
Uh, sure you got enough for the story? 
Yeah, I have an excellent source. 
Well, every fact better check out. 
It's the kind of story that can make a career, Annie. 
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! 
I'd be careful doing that. 
Oh. Right. 
How's it going? 
Good. It's, uh... 
It's going great, actually. 
I think I got a new job. 
Yeah? You know... 
That's fantastic. Congratulations. 
Thank you. 
 Hey, you're a lawyer, right?  
 Yes. 
Do you know anything about breaking leases? 
Why? You guys thinking about moving? 
Nah, it's just, you know, Lou is still kind of freaked out about this place. 
Uh, you know, I-I love it here, but... 
You want me to take a look at your lease for you? 
That'd be great. 
Well, so what do you think? 
Any wiggle room? 
Oh. I don't know. 
Gavin drew it up pretty ironclad. 
Clearly he doesn't like people breaking deals. 
Hey, maybe you could talk to him for us. 
I mean, you guys have gotten pretty tight, right? 
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that. 
We... we work for him. 
Hey, you guys went to the Lincoln center, cocktail parties, club. Hey, trust me. 
The old resident manager wasn't taking a steam with Gavin Doran. 
We didn't take a st... 
All right, I'll see what I can do. 
Hey, why don't you let Lou and I take you guys out tonight to celebrate? 
Uh, you know, it's... it's not official. 
There's a bunch of I's to dot. 
Listen, man, this town is hard enough as it is. 
Just one thing I've learned... 
celebrate success. 
Yeah. Sure. That'd be great. 
Let me, uh, let me just talk to Jane. 
Where do you guys wanna go? 
No clue. We have not been 
below 14th street yet. 
Seriously? Wow. 
We used to go out all the time. 
I mean, Lou was just dialed into that whole world until we had to slow things down. 
You know, city got pretty tempting. 
Yeah. I see how that can happen. 
Nice view, huh? 
You remind me of her, you know? 
How so? 
She was curious like you. 
Sasha loved exploring the Drake. 
Mm. 
You have her same spirit, same energy. 
And then, when she was about 15, something... happened. 
More than the usual adolescent angst. 
Something changed, and... 
I could never reach her again. 
I was the one who found the note. 
Olivia, y-you don't have to... 
I've never told anyone about it. 
Even Gavin? 
Gavin doesn't know. 
And Gavin won't know. 
Sasha and Gavin had a falling out the night before, and it wasn't his fault, but I... 
He'd blame himself, I know. 
At least I can spare him that pain. 
It's the least I can do. 
I admire your courage, Olivia, but... 
Ten years is a long time to carry that kind of burden. 
Oh, I'm not carrying it alone. 
Not anymore. 
Yeah, I don't know what happened between you and your daughter, but... 
I would've loved to have a mother like you. 
That's sweet, Jane. 
But I'm much too young to be your mother. 
Ohh. Welcome home, darling. 
Hello, ladies. 
Well, uh... 
I should probably be getting back. 
Jane, thanks for lunch. 
You're very welcome. 
Good night, Gavin. 
You have to stop blaming yourself, Liv. 
It was an accident. 
Hey, babe. 
What was that for? 
I missed you today. 
Well, I can't wait to see what happens when I tell you that I got a new job. 
 You what?!  
 Yeah. 
I-I didn't even know you were looking. 
What happened? 
It's not official yet, but there is an opportunity with a city councilman to be his chief of staff. 
Now I wish I could take all the credit, but it was Gavin. 
Honestly, he... he brought 
something out of me today. 
He challenged me. It was amazing. 
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you. 
So get ready because we're gonna go out and celebrate with Brian and Louise. 
 Is she up to it? 
 Uh, yeah. 
Apparently, Brian says she's feeling great. 
Henry, I-I'm gonna be right back. 
Oh, my God. 
It's bad in there. 
What's bad? 
Hello, Jane. 
I'm sorry I startled you. 
I just came down for these, the original blueprints. 
Oh. Yeah, thanks, Gavin. 
Deal's a deal. 
Have a good night. 
Gavin, wait. 
S-sometimes these buildings can be a little creepy. 
Yeah. 
I know just what you mean. 
Wow! Look it! You guys look great! 
Yeah, I clean up good. 
Ready to go? 
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. 
So what exactly are we doing tonight? 
We, my friends, are gonna go dancing. 
Louise, this is amazing! 
I used to come here a lot in high school. 
I'm sorry. I can't hear you. What? 
It's a long story. 
I used to be a total club kid... thank you. 
Before my White Knight here rescued me from a life of debauchery and fun. 
Oh, that's not the exact story. 
Brian's play had just come out on Broadway... 
if I could brag for a second. 
He was the toast of the town. 
I just rode his coattails. 
Dude, I had no idea you were, like, a big... 
Success? Eh, it was a while ago. 
You guys, I'm so glad we're doing this, especially as you're... you're moving out. 
What? What are you talking about? 
Oh! Henry said you were looking to move. 
Hey, honey, did you know that Jane thinks the Drake is haunted? 
Oh, I-I... 
 I never said haunted. I... 
 I never said "haunted." 
I-I may have said something when we were working on your lease. 
Uh, I think I said "ghost," maybe. 
Uh, not like you're afraid of ghosts, but I'm really... uh, I'm drowning, babe. 
 Yeah, you need to stop talking. Yeah. 
 You just jump in and... okay, thank you. 
Okay, wait. I'm... I'm confused. 
Why would you be looking over our lease? 
What the hell, Brian? 
No. No, no, no. 
It was just to see what our options were. 
That makes absolutely no sense. 
Our apartment is amazing. Gavin 
made right with the accident. 
There's no reason we're gonna need to move. 
Aah! Oh, my God. Alexis just got here. 
Hey! Come here! 
How hilarious! 
Brian, how random is that? 
It's pretty random. 
All right, Mr. Kandinsky, 
what is your story? 
"A ruthless figure of the Russian mafia, "Kandinsky has eluded law enforcement "in several countries. 
"It's been years since anyone has seen his face. 
"A lethal enforcer, "Kandinsky was known to torture his victims to death "with pliers and wrenches, "which he carried in a so-called 'murder kit, ' his face marked by a jagged scar." 
Hello? 
Is somebody there? 
No! No! 
Help me, please! 
Please, help me! 
Your call cannot... Be completed as dialed. 
No! No! Please hang up and try again. 
Listen, I am sorry I said anything to Brian. 
All right? I will never 
betray your trust again. 
Okay? Like it or not, we're 
gonna be together forever, so that's an enormous commitment I just made. 
 You're drunk. 
 This is true. 
But it doesn't change what I said. 
It just means that I probably could've said it a little bit better. 
You know what? Take me 
home and all is forgiven. 
I love you. 
I'm sorry. 
I couldn't quite hear you over the thumping bass in here. 
 I love you. 
 Say what? 
Ah, thank you, Gavin. 
Now that I've hired your boy, time to talk about my favorite part of the deal... 
my compensation. 
The boy... is your compensation. 
He's the best hire you'll ever make. 
Well, I'm sure he's very industrious, but, uh, be a shame to crush his dreams. 
Oh, you let me worry about his dreams. 
You should be more concerned about getting me the greenpoint towers project. 
Is that what this is about? 
I mean, come on, Gavin. 
We've been through this. 
There's nothing I can do. 
I don't own the building. 
I am a simple councilman... 
Who controls all the redevelopment rights in your district. 
Why are you so interested in Greenpoint? 
It's one broken window away from being condemned. 
How is that a good investment? 
So says the simple councilman. 
Now I'd like to help you out here, Gavin, but I can't. 
In fact, there's a... there's 
someone else, another investor. 
It seems I underestimated your greed. 
It won't happen again. 
So what's the number? 
Well, there is no number. 
Something more than that, more than money. 
Let's just say that, uh, he understands what it is that I'm really after. 
Enlighten me. 
Come on. Let's go. 
Oh, we're having fun! 
Come on, baby, dance with us! 
Yeah, Brian. Loosen up. 
I wanna go. 
I'll call you! Good-bye! 
And there's no way I can change your mind? 
I wouldn't have lasted this long in New York politics if I wasn't a man of my word. 
Yeah, you're a paragon of integrity. 
Hey, come on. I hired your boy, didn't I? 
All things considered, you had a pretty good day, huh? 
Henry. 
Mr. Doran said he wanted to 
see you when you got in. 
It's 2:00 in the morning. 
He said tonight. 
Message delivered. 
Well, maybe he found out what we did in the limo. 
No one better find out. 
 I'll be back in five minutes.  
 Mm. Okay. 
Don't. 
What? 
Don't what? 
Don't let him out. 
You wanted to see me, Gavin? 
Come on over, Henry. 
It's so peaceful this time of night, when everyone's dreams are real, until the sun comes up and they realize that they're not. 
And that's why I wanted to talk to you, Henry. 
What do you mean? 
This Bill Edwards job, I've been thinking about it. 
Maybe it's not for you. 
What do you mean? Did you hear something? 
No, but I know men like Edwards. 
Too many skeletons in the closet. 
He's never gonna be a real player. 
I think chief of staff for a councilman's a pretty big step for me. 
No, no, no. You don't get it, Henry. 
You don't want to be the one to work on a campaign. 
You want to be the one with the campaign. 
Dream big. 
You've gotta want it all. 
Help me, somebody! 
Somebody help me! 
Help! 
Hello? 
Is anybody in there? 
Is anybody in here? 
Henry! 
I was right about henry. He's a hero. 
You've been watching me from your window. 
You need to leave. 
Really? 
What is that? 
They were a fraternal brotherhood called the Order of the Dragon. 
 Don't let him out. 
 Who? 
I get the feeling like the dead won't stay dead. 
Corrected by honeybunny We need to talk about what happened, Peter, and that strange ritual. 
It was supposed to bring us incredible wealth. 
It was a sham. 
How I wish that it had been. 
There's blood on our hands. 
My God. 
What did we do? 
We invited evil into our homes. 
That's what we did. 
I'm home. 
Daddy! 
Happy Halloween. 
You, too, dear. 
Honey, you're early. 
Dinner will be ready in just a few minutes. 
What's wrong? 
It was a bad day. 
They closed down the firm. 
But I-I think I found a way out of it. 
I want you to know something, my dear. 
In heaven, you will be truly happy. 
What? 
Peter, what's wrong with your eye? 
Peter. 
No. No. 
No! 
No! 
No! 
Keep it safe. 
Keep it in the family. I love you. 
The salmon tartar and the duck terrine should be perfect. 
Thank you. 
Oh, Marcel. 
More candelabras, less cobwebs. 
This is Halloween at the Drake, not an amusement park. 
Uh, spooky and also elegant. 
 Okay? 
 Oh, yes, Mrs. Doran. 
Oh! Jane, thank God. I'm 
late meeting Gavin. 
Would you mind finishing up the decorations? 
Oh, Olivia, I would love to, but Henry's "First Cup New York" interview's in an hour, and I'm heading over to the studio to see him. 
 TV? 
 Yeah. 
Just as my party could use a little celebrity cache. 
I'm glad Henry's capitalizing on the incident at the mayor's house. 
Very savvy. 
I think he's just enjoying his moment in the spotlight, you know? 
It's gonna be more than a moment, my dear. 
Well, I...the lobby is gonna look amazing. 
Really has that haunted house feel. 
Too much on the cobwebs? 
No. No. 
I mean, Halloween's all about excess, right? 
I'll see you soon. 
My guest in the studio is Henry Martin, the man who saved commissioner Pike's life and stopped a gunman from hurting any more innocent people at the mayor's house. 
 Henry, hi. 
 Hi. 
Can you...can you take 
us through that night? 
What were you thinking? 
Um, honestly, nothing. 
No, it's true. I... I just reacted. 
I think if I had time to think, I'm...I'm pretty sure I 
would've been terrified. 
Oh, you know, I don't know about that. 
You're a hero, Henry. 
Uh, no. No, I'm not. I... 
I think it was a case of being in the right place at the right time. 
But I'm not a hero. I did 
what anyone would've done. 
Well, in this city, I'm not so sure about that. 
Here's the best part of the story. 
He's modest, handsome, and available. 
That's right. No wedding ring, ladies. 
You know, aside from Derek Jeter, I bet that you're the most eligible bachelor in New York. 
Uh, I... Henry Martin, thank 
you so much for joining us. 
And... we're out. 
Okay. You know, I really 
admire what you did. 
Oh. Thank you. Yeah. 
Um, and...and just for the record, 
I have a girlfriend that I love very much. 
The...the cute blonde waving 
from behind the monitor. 
Yeah. That's...that's her. 
You know, it makes for a better story if you're single. 
You are good. 
That was good. 
Look at me. Just a small 
town girl from Kokomo kissing New York's most eligible bachelor. 
I'm s...I'm sorry. Do I know you? 
Apparently not, no. 
I'm so sorry. Look, I was 
gonna say I have a girlfriend before they...they cut to a commercial... 
or whatever they do. 
 You are so busted right now. 
 I know. 
I knew I'd screw it up. 
That's the last interview I'm ever doing. 
Then that would be the second stupid thing you've said today. 
That's actually not a bad batting average for me. 
Laurel Harris. I'm a media consultant. 
 Hi. This is, uh... 
 The girlfriend. 
 Yes. Jane Van Veen. Nice to meet you. 
 Pleasure. 
Out of curiosity, what was the other stupid thing I said? 
Not saying you had a girlfriend? 
No. Honestly, on that one, you got lucky. 
You said, "I'm not a hero." 
Now it's fine to be modest. 
Humility can be a powerful tool. 
But if you wanna use this for political gain, never let words come out of your mouth that someone can use against you. 
I'm sorry. You said "Political gain"? 
I would...I think you have the wrong guy. 
Do I? 
No, I thought you worked at the mayor's office. 
Most people there have at least considered what it would be like to sit stop the throne. 
You haven't? 
Um, not in a serious way. 
Okay. Fair enough. 
I'm based in L.A., but I'm 
in town for a few weeks. 
If you change your mind, I'd love to sit down and talk about what our firm can do for you. 
Um... I'm...I'm flattered, but I... 
I'm sorry. I'm just not really 
understanding what you mean. 
Before you know it, your 15 minutes will be up. 
That's why I come in. 
I can take your 15 minutes and make it a lifetime. 
Well, I went to four different stores, but I finally found a costume. 
It's old-school, and I think you're gonna love it. 
Oh, my God. Um, Brian... 
This is Scott. 
Uh, you're probably wondering why I'm massaging your wife's stomach. 
Yeah. An explanation would be nice. 
Scott is a doctor. He 
lives in our building. 
4G. I've seen you in the elevator before. 
You're the, uh, you're the big playwright. 
I've done a little writing myself. 
Well, in college. 
So what's...what's going on, Lou? You okay? 
Yeah. I think I just overdid it 
a bit dancing the other night. 
My ribs are super sore. 
Dr. Scott was nice enough 
to make a house call. 
Oh. Well, thank you for that. 
Uh, what's the verdict, doc? 
She has a-a strained ab muscle. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 So no dancing for a few weeks. 
Tonight's party, that's included. 
You got me? 
Deal. Thank you so much. 
I really appreciate it. 
Buy me a drink tonight, and we're even. 
All right. Well, thanks 
again for coming by. 
Um, wait. Uh, Dr. Scott? 
Um, I'm feeling really uncomfortable. 
I have to make it through the whole party tonight. 
Is there anything I should be taking? Or... 
Tequila? 
I'm kidding. 
Ice it if it gets really bad. 
Okay. Great. 
Thank you. 
He's nice, right? 
He saw me wincing in the elevator. 
He felt bad. He wanted to help me out. 
He's cute, right? 
Eh, he's not really my type. 
For Alexis. 
I think I'm gonna try to set them up tonight at the party. 
Alexis is gonna be at the party? 
Oh. It's great. 
Well, you know it's the party of the season when "Page Six" asks for more invitations. 
Good publicity is priceless. 
Well, speaking of good publicity, Henry just got interviewed for "First Cup New York." 
I assumed he'd make the rounds. 
Well, you sure know how to pick him. 
Oh, hold on. 
Oh, it's the caterer. 
 Can you take this, hon? 
 Yeah. 
Okay, thanks. 
Hello? 
Yes. 
No. No. 
I'll take those, Mr. Doran. 
Olivia! 
 Hey, are you all right? 
 Did you see that maniac? 
He almost killed me. 
Yeah. 
Okay, uh, we need to go. 
The party starts in, like, now, Henry. 
Oh, you've seen the look Olivia gives us if we use the wrong salad fork. 
Oh. I have no interest in 
crossing that woman on Halloween. 
You like my costume? 
Sexy Devil? 
Super hot. 
And I definitely want credit for the "Hot/devil" pun. 
Ah, very witty. Now stop 
talking, start undressing. 
 We have to go, like, now. 
 Wait a second. Time out. 
I have a feeling our costumes are already taken care of. 
"A little something for your first Halloween at the Drake." 
Wow. It's like having our 
very own fairy godmother. 
Yeah, who lets herself in whenever she wants. 
What is this? 
Oh, my God. 
Are we required to wear these? 
Nice costume. 
Did I surprise you? 
No. I'm just not used to you knocking. 
Uh, Louise is in the shower. 
Brian... 
Can we talk for a second? 
Sure. 
I feel like I owe you an apology... 
for everything. 
I'm sorry for getting all psycho on you. 
 I thought we had a connection and I... 
 We don't. 
Understood. 
It was wrong of me to kiss you. 
I-I was way out of line. 
I really like Louise and I need to keep my job. 
Here. 
From now on, I will stay out of your way. 
Promise. 
This is me coming clean. 
Friends? 
Yeah. 
Fine. 
Hey, Lou, Alexis is here! 
I'll be right out! 
So who is this sexy doctor she's been telling me about? 
You know, I think everyone is overstating his level of attractiveness. 
Jealous much? 
Not really, even though he was massaging her stomach. 
Relax. 
She's his patient. He's 
examined her a bunch of times. 
What? Didn't they just meet today? 
You know what? Maybe I have it wrong. 
Nah, come on. 
How many times has he examined her? 
I don't know. Uh, two or three? 
Two or three. 
She...she probably didn't tell you 
because she didn't want you to worry. 
Yeah. 
There's a new sheriff in town, maybe? 
I think that was Olivia's little joke. 
And for the record, I have no idea who you're supposed to be. 
You know those starlings that attacked me in Barlow's apartment? 
I think I'm Tippi Hedren from "The Birds." 
That's what I thought. 
And I can't decide whether that's really cool or really creepy. 
Well, It's Halloween. 
I guess it's supposed to be a little of both. 
How you doing? 
I dig the period suit. 
First rule of a good costume... comfort first. 
I like your necklace. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me. 
You coming? 
No. 
All right. Have a good night, partner. 
I have to finish this. 
A friend from the NYPD advised me that those texts were most likely sent from a disposable cell phone. 
They're not traceable. 
Well, a man in your position got a lot of enemies. 
Any idea who? 
Someone smart enough not to challenge me head-on. 
Security's vetting everyone, even residents. 
Masks off, presenting I.D. 
If he, uh, tries anything, we're ready. 
I'm, uh, I'm ready. 
Don't shoot yourself. 
I'll try not to. 
Do you mind? 
Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure, yeah. 
You you can trust me, Mr. Doran. 
I do trust you, Tony. 
I'm trusting you with my most-prized possession. 
My wife. 
During the party, I want you to stick close to her. 
She's the most valuable thing in the world to me. 
Things are getting crazy in the Drake! 
Yeah, I feel like I'm at my parents house and I don't want to break anything. 
Oh, come on. Take a night off. Let's drink! 
Aw, all right. 
Oh! Ohh, no. Oh, shoot! 
Oh, no. Your birds are soaked. 
Well, you know, I guess that, uh that gives me an excuse to change, right? 
Oh, you know what? I'll come with you. 
Yeah, me, too. Come on. 
No, stop it. I'll be two seconds. 
Enjoy yourself. I'll be right back. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. Yes. Enjoy it. 
I'll be one sec. 
Thank you. 
Cheers. Mm-hmm. 
I have to admit I wish all my nurses looked as good as you. 
I have a confession, too. 
I've never actually played doctor with a real doctor before. 
Really? 
Wow. They really look like 
they're hitting it off, huh? 
Yeah. 
What kind of doctor is he again? 
Surgeon, I think. 
Obviously good with his hands. 
I'm kidding. 
Honey, you should've seen the look on your face when you walked in on us. 
A stranger's hands on your stomach? 
I mean, I think all things considered, I was pretty cool. 
Hardly a stranger. Honey, 
he's been really great. 
He's come by whenever I needed him. 
So today wasn't the first time? 
No. Uh, we met a few weeks ago. Why? 
Uh, earlier, when you said that he saw you in the elevator, I just assumed that, uh, you met this morning. 
Okay. I should come clean. 
We've been having a scandalous affair, and now that I've had my fun with him, I thought maybe I should pass him off to Alexis. 
Brian, look, my ribs have been killing me, okay? 
I didn't want to worry you. 
Besides, honey, do you honestly think I would ever cheat on you? 
No. I'm sorry. 
Let's get some more tequila, 'cause I may not be able to dance, but I can drink. 
Done. 
Okay. 
What do you want? 
What is it, sweetheart? 
He got out. 
Who got out? 
Daddy. 
"Family tragedy. 
"Man kills wife, girl survives rampage." 
"Jocelyn." 
Daddy? 
Oh, my God. 
Peter... 
Kramer. 
Excuse me. Aren't you that guy 
that stopped the gunman at the mayor's mansion? 
Uh, yeah, but it's not a big deal. 
Of course it is. 
Why else would I be here? 
 Laurel. 
 Laurel. Right. 
Hi. How are you? 
What are you... what are you doing here? 
Our New York office always receives invites to the Dorans' parties. 
Here's some free advice, Henry... 
being modest on TV makes you look appealing. 
Being too modest in person makes you seem weak. 
Don't downplay what you've done. 
I'm not downplaying. 
And for the record, I am not buying that "Aw, shucks" attitude. 
I think that behind your midwestern smile, you are as driven as our eminent host. 
So where is your fiancee? 
Uh, girlfriend. Jane. She had to go change. 
Don't you think it's time that you take the next step before you really do earn the title of New York's most eligible bachelor? 
I think we're okay with how things are right now. 
Spoken like every man who's ever lived to the women he had no intention of proposing to her. 
Oh, no. I... 
I definitely want to marry her. 
She doesn't? 
No. She... 
 She doesn't. 
 She does, I do, just not at this moment. 
If you really love her, I'd seal the deal now, before the concrete jungle drives you apart. 
Well, that won't happen. 
Well, New York changes people. 
Not Jane and not me. 
We'll see. 
So it looked like you and Alexis were having a good time. 
You okay? 
Yeah. I-I think I tweaked something. 
It's really hurting, actually. 
Well, did you take anything? 
Just aspirin. 
I think I need something a little stronger. 
Please? 
Okay. Come on. 
I'll take another look at you. 
Ladies, let me introduce you to apartment 5F, where one of the first residents of the Drake, Peter Kramer, murdered his wife with a hatchet on Halloween night in 1929. 
I should head back downstairs. 
My husband'll send out a search party. 
Well, I guess it's just the two of us. 
Shall we? 
You didn't really expect me to be scared. 
I bet you one SPA day at exhale you can't last five minutes inside this apartment alone. 
Oh, five minutes? You're on. 
Peter... 
Kramer... 
Drake. 
Henry? 
Oh, my God. 
You're Peter Kramer. 
You're not real. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God! No! No! 
I'm sorry. Are you okay? 
Um, can I please borrow your phone? 
 It's an emergency. 
 Uh, yeah. 
Thank you so much. Thank you. 
9-1-1. 
Yes. Yes, hello. 
Um, somebody broke into my apartment and attacked me. 
Uh, the address is 999 park avenue. 
It's called the Drake. 
Somebody's trying to kill me. 
 Oh, my God. Are you all right? 
 Look out! 
No! 
Sorry. That scared me. 
You think that was supposed to happen? 
I don't think so. 
I gotta find Jane. 
I have your wife, Mr. Doran. 
Name your price. 
What makes you think I'm after money? 
Joy playing games with people's lives. 
How does it feel to be on the other end? 
If you know what I'm capable of, why push me? 
To let you know you're not invulnerable. 
If you hurt her... 
That depends entirely on you, and if you can find her in time. 
Where is Olivia? 
She went to show her friends apartment 5F. 
Get up to the penthouse. 
 See if she shows up there. 
 Yeah, all right. 
Alexis. Hey. 
What the hell is going on with Louise? 
What do you mean? Nothing. 
I just watched her leave with Dr. Scott. 
So? 
So why the hell would she leave a party in the middle without even telling me? 
I'm sure there is an explanation. 
Check your apartment. 
She's probably up there. 
Alone. 
Hello? 
Please get us the hell out of here! 
Can somebody get us out of this elevator? 
Louise. Stop. It's not gonna help. 
Look, I-I-I just have to get off this elevator. Okay? 
Can, you, um, can you call 9-1-1? 
I left my phone upstairs. 
Hello? 
Actually, where is my phone? 
 Oh, God. 
 Louise, look at... 
Someone, please. Hello? 
Louise! Stop. 
Okay, look at me. Calm... down. 
Okay, look, I-I have to get off this elevator. 
You don't understand. 
This thing tried to kill me before, okay? 
Take a deep breath. 
 Got it? 
 Yeah. 
You know, the way you were pounding on that door, it doesn't seem like your ribs are bothering you at all. 
Maybe the adrenaline blocked the pain. 
Louise, I'm not stupid. 
I know what's going on. 
I've examined you three times, Louise, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with you, except... you need more pills. 
Lou? 
Lou, are you up here? 
Louise? 
Mrs. D? You in here? 
Hello? 
Olivia? 
Tony. 
Help. 
Wait. Wait. 
Where is Olivia? 
I don't know. He got into the safe. 
You want me to call the cops? 
No. 
Go down to the party and check on the guests. 
Okay. 
Olivia? 
Honey. 
Where am I? 
You are on our terrace. 
Why are you smiling? 
Because I was worried when I couldn't find you. 
I don't know what happened. 
What's the last thing you remember? 
I was with the girls, and then it's foggy. 
Is everything okay? 
Yes, everything is fine. 
Oh, oh, my head is spinning. 
Oh. Here. You're freezing. 
Come on. Let's go in. 
No abuse. 
No childhood trauma. 
Just a classic club kid hooked on speed because I was stupid. 
But you quit 'cause you're so smart. 
Well, not smart. 
Scared. 
One night... 
Let's just say I hit rock bottom. 
I went to rehab and I haven't done any pills since... 
since lately. 
Look, Brian doesn't know anything about this. Okay? 
I-I don't want him to find out either. 
Thank you. 
You do realize that it's not just your run-in with the elevator that's causing your relapse? 
Are you suggesting that because my life isn't perfect, I'm self-medicating? 
Usually, there's... there's something more. 
How are things with Brian? 
Fine. 
They're fine. 
Good. 
You know, if you need someone to talk to... 
Thanks. 
Whoa! What was that about? 
I'm sorry. Sorry. 
 Sorry. I guess I misread your signals. 
 Yes. 
 Sorry. 
 I... I love my husband. 
Weren't you just flirting with my assistant? 
The two of you seemed pretty steamy. 
Yeah. 
You're way more screwed up than I am. 
Jane? 
Hello? 
I hope you don't mind me tagging along. 
I'm just a little freaked out. 
Yeah, yeah. Sure. 
Hello? 
Henry. 
Jane, I've been looking all over for you. 
Somebody attacked me and chased me through the building. 
Jane, where are you? 
Fifth floor. North wing. 
Please hurry. He's trying to kill me. 
Call the police. 
No. No. 
Please. 
Please don't do this! 
Don't be afraid. 
P-Peter, right? 
Why are you doing this? 
I have to save you. 
Save me? W... 
I have to do this. 
Please. Please. I'm not... 
I'm not who you think I am. 
So...so will you just let me go? 
I want you to know something, dear. 
In heaven, You're going to be truly happy. 
Shh. Jane. Jane, it's me. 
It's me. It's me. It's me. 
Oh! I got you. Oh. 
Con Ed is working to get the power back on in the building. 
Everybody, return to your apartments. 
Clear the lobby. 
The man who gave me his phone was wearing a devil costume. 
He was trying to help. 
We've got people looking for him. 
Well, there was a lot of blood. 
He... he wouldn't have made it. 
 Jane, it's not your fault. 
 No. 
What about the killer? Uh, give 
me any kind of description? 
No, I-I-I mean, I-I didn't see his face. 
Once the power went out, people got a little nervous. 
But nothing out of the ordinary happened. 
Calm down. 
I am sure that text was a joke. 
And not a good one. 
Louise would never cheat on you. 
Son of a bitch. 
Brian, what the hell?! 
Leave me alone. 
Hey, where are you going? 
Let him cool off. He's 
been drinking all night. 
Brian! 
You have no idea what you've stolen. 
Oh, but I do. 
Return the box before it's too late for both of us. 
That will never happen. 
This isn't over. 
Whoever you are, wherever you are, I'm coming for you.
