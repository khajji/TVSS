 Previously On "10 Things i Hate About You"... 
 it's first day of school, so Remember the most important thing, don't get pregnant. Bye, dad. -You 
*** at school. 
I'm Chasity. this is my boyfriend, 
Joey Donner. 
Who is Captain Intensity over there? 
Patrick Verona. People say he 
knows the taste of human flesh. 
Please. My name's Cameron. 
I'm so lucky to have met you. 
You're my first GBF. 
 What...  A GBF? 
 Gay best friend. 
People are not scared of me. 
Sure they are. That's why 
I find you interesting. 
Maybe I'm a really bad boyfriend. 
You're, like, the perfect boyfriend. 
All this time we've been friends, you've liked me? 
I've loved you. I don't feel the same way. 
You have no right to do that. Bam. 
They're making us wear uniforms. 
So you don't give a damn that we no longer have the rights that are guaranteed to us in the Bill of Rights? 
What's the point? 
It's not like we can change it. 
Be quiet, please. 
Shut up and listen to her. 
Joey and I broke up. I cut him loose. 
Come back here with that, or you're suspended, too. 
Then I guess I'm suspended. 
You sure about this? No. 
But I'm doing it. 
Hey, Kat. It's your sister calling 
from a deserted parking lot. 
Oh, hello, creepy man in a van. 
I don't need a ride. 
My sister's picking me up. 
Thanks. Call me. 
Hey, Fivehead. Do you need a ride home? 
Joey, we can't be seen together. 
Chastity has vowed to dismember the girl who kissed you, and our make-out sessions won't be nearly as fun if I have no arms. 
This sucks. 
I just want to shout from the rooftops I'm dating Bianca Stratford! 
That is so sweet, but could you just mouth it? 
Okay, I have a simple two-step plan to get us through this. 
Step 1, we date in secret. Joey. 
Oh. Doing them now. 
Step 2, we track down the surveillance tape of our make-out session before Chastity sees it. 
Cool. We could watch it together. 
So we can erase it. 
That's good, too. No bad ideas. 
Oh, God. Get down. Hi, Chastity. 
Hop in, B. I'll give you a ride. 
We can play a game. It's called 
Top 10 Ways to Torture the Skank Who Kissed Joey. 
I'll go first. Waterboarding, duh. 
TP her locker? Lame. 
Put semi-permanent green dye in her sham-- Mm-mm. 
Throw her in the ocean in a meat bikini. I love it. 
I can't believe I just did that! 
I can't believe I just walked out of school! 
It was so exciting. I wonder 
if Gandhi ever felt like this, so alive, so inspired, so-- Hot. 
We took a stand. Uh-huh. 
We told the establishment to stick it. 
Yeah, yeah, we're heroes. 
Let's go in. Hell, no. 
And I thought you were a tough guy. 
I'm suspended. My dad is going to kill me. 
I am so stressed out about this Chastity thing, I can't even enjoy the fact that Dad is going to kill you. 
Hi. Dad, I'm so glad you're home. 
Relax. I just got here. Hi, honey. 
Hi, Daddy. So I heard some good news today. 
I heard someone got suspended. 
Who was it again? 
Oh, that's right. It was you. 
What are you doing? Don't you know 
it goes on your permanent record? 
I thought you were going to drop this. 
I was going to, but-- But what? 
What happened in between me ordering you back into school and you walking out of it? 
I had to stand up for my principles. 
They were hassling some guy. 
Guy? There's a guy now? 
Do you know this guy? What guy? Some guy. 
Some-- Some poor kid. 
Oh, a kid. They were going 
to search his backpack. 
Someone had to intervene before they performed a full-body cavity search. 
This is America, not Xinjiang. 
Do you notice that this isn't China or Tibet or Cambodia? 
But there is an emperor here, and it's me. 
Who, incidentally, taught me to think for myself. 
Oh, no. You can't blame me for this. 
You broke the rules. You're going to 
have to deal with the consequences. 
I know. I'm suspended tomorrow. 
No, these consequences. 
You're painting the living room tomorrow. 
Just in case you don't get into a college, now you'll have a skill to make a living. 
Okay, does the back of this girl's head look like the back of mine? 
No. She doesn't have enough 
What do you call them? 
Natural highlights. Natural, sure. 
What are you doing? 
All that Chastity knows about Joey's mystery girl is she's blonde and thin, so I'm assembling a list of suspects. 
Once Chastity sees how huge it is, she'll be overwhelmed and give up. 
Thank God we live in California. 
Here's a thought. 
If you didn't do anything wrong, why not just tell the Satanic Smurfette the truth? 
Like you did? i did? 
Dad, they were totally going to search some poor kid's bag, so I had to stand up for his rights and ride off into the sunset with him on the back of his bitchen motorcycle. 
Bianca, I was standing up for our constitutional protections. 
Oh, my God. Shut up. 
You're like a live feed from CNN. 
So I told Bianca I need time to get over her, then I turned and walked away without looking back. 
Yes, yes, I was hoping you wouldn't look back. 
Good for you, bro. You finally told her off. 
When you say it like that, it sounds harsh. 
Now I feel bad. Maybe I should apologize. 
After all, it's not her fault she doesn't love me back. 
Dude, if you really want to get over Bianca, stop making excuses and get angry. 
Did you learn anything from your parents' divorce? 
I'm not angry. I'm just 
hurt and disappointed, and for some reason, I can't listen to the radio. 
Bianca rejected you, okay? 
You gave her your heart, and she riverdanced over it, then made out with the quarterback of the football team. 
And you want to apologize? 
Not that much anymore. 
Oh. Hey, Cameron. 
How are you? Very well, thank you. 
Yeah, buddy. Yes! Hey, bestie. 
I found out where they keep the surveillance tapes. 
You did? Oh, goodie. 
They're locked in the AV closet. 
I tried to bribe the janitor to open it, but he's afraid he'll lose his job. 
Like there aren't a million other bathrooms to clean out there. 
Well, darn it. I guess we'll 
never get the tape, then. 
Well, that's what I thought, until I remebered that that tall nerd person friend of yours is king of the AV club. 
Get the key from him, okay? 
I'd do it myself, but I don't want to look petty and vindictive. 
You cannot come in. 
If my dad sees you here, his head will explode, and then I'll have to repaint. 
Your dad's at work. How's he 
going to see me? Hidden cameras? 
Yes. Come on. I'll help you paint. 
It's the least I can do. 
After all, you did get suspended for me. 
Don't flatter yourself. 
I got suspended for my principles. 
I just fled the scene with you. 
Really? Because I think... 
I'm not kidding. I can't mess around. 
You don't get the point of being suspended at all. 
Day off, no school. It's like a vacation. 
This is not a vacation. 
After I paint this entire room, I have to study for an English test I was supposed to take. 
If you get suspended on a test day, you get a zero. 
Dem's da rules. 
A zero? No. They'll just 
have to make an exception. 
I don't think they do that. 
Not that I've ever tried. 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't get a zero. 
That'll bring down my whole GPA, and on top of the suspension Why did I do something so stupid? I have 
ruined my entire life, my whole future. 
I won't get into Brown. 
I won't be able to protect civil liberties and crusade against injustice. 
And I can't even be a house painter because I suck at it. 
Don't you think you're overreacting? 
It's your first day as a painter. 
You'll get better. 
I'm just kidding. 
If this test is that important, then just break into school and take it. 
How am I going to do that? With my help. 
I'm not so sure about this. 
What if somebody recognizes me? 
Don't worry. With that hood and glasses, 
they'll just think you're a celebrity. 
Whoa, check it out, dudes. 
It's Patrick Verona. 
And he brought our favorite freedom fighter, the Dalai Mama. 
Really? Me, your favorite? 
Because of you getting your protesting back out, we got to empty our lockers, all full to brimming with sweet hydro. 
That's exactly what I was fighting for Your stash. Could you guys get in 
and grab the wheel, please, before the BKWs catch us? 
We need passage. 
The southwest hall is clear. How do you know? 
There's an app for that. 
Bianca. Joey. Bianca, I got your text. 
How'd you get out of class? 
I told the teacher I was itching. 
God, you're pretty. 
Thanks, but that's not why I need to talk to you. 
We have an emergency. Step 2 of our plan 
is about to go off the rails. Step 2. 
Destroying the security tape. 
Are we done with step 1? 
No. Step 1 is like the Olympic torch 
It's always going. 
Now listen-- I need you to get into Cameron's pants. 
He's gay. It shouldn't be that hard. 
To steal his keys. That's what I thought. 
He has gym next period. 
Steal his keys. Get them to me. 
I'll get the tape, erase it, then you slip his keys back into his pants before the class ends. 
Do I need to write this down? 
I don't mean to diss on your plan, because it's really complicated and awesome, but why can't you just ask him for the keys? 
Because he's mad at me. Long story. Strange. 
But listen, we need to act fast. 
If we don't, Chastity will, and then we'll have to move to Bolivia. 
Calm down, Five-o. No one's moving to Africa. 
I'll get you those keys. Oh, Joey. Bianca. 
School police. I need to see that hall pass. 
This watermark looks like it was made with diet soda. 
Do I look like an idiot to you? 
You Out from yurs class to make out with your boyfriend? 
Just the last ten minutes. Besides, it's 
history. I already know how it ends. 
Everyone dies. 
Aren't you supposed to be painting the living room? 
I have to take an English test. 
You broke into school to take a test? 
You are so weird. 
Hi, I'm Joey, Bianca's boyfriend. 
We should double sometime. 
Joey, we're dating in secret. 
Bianca, I think they know. 
I was never here. 
You Stratford sisters are a strange breed. 
Kat? Aren't you suspended? 
Would I be here if I were suspended? No. 
I'd be home watching Oprah. 
Did you know I was once an audience member on her show? 
You don't say. 
They gave us all a pair of these tennis shoes that firm your butt just by wearing them. 
That Oprah deserves the Nobel prize. 
She is a saint. 
Are you trying to steal my keys? 
No, no, I was just admiring them from a-close. 
Okay, look. Bianca told me that 
you guys are kind of in a fight. 
Yeah, well, I don't want to talk about it Especially with you, Joey Donner. 
I'm sorry. I understand. 
Well, not really, but Bianca needs your help. 
Does she, now? Yep. 
See, there's this security tape, and I'm supposed to get your key, so Wait a minute. Let me check my notes. 
Keys out of pants. Get the keys to Bianca, 
who destroys tape, then go Are you done? I have a rope to climb. 
Okay, man to man. 
Me and Bianca, we're making out on a tape that's locked in the AV closet. 
We need to get the said tape before Chastity sees it and bad things happen. 
So I'm just a part of her master plan? 
Yeah, but you're not supposed to know. 
Oh, and don't tell anybody that we're dating. 
I always forget step 1. 
So you're dating now? Well, congratulations. 
Thanks! Hey, thought 
How about you snag the tape for us? 
That makes it so much easier. 
Sure, bro. I'll get you the tape. 
And then I'll even sweeten it up, with a little Jay-Z and some cool effects. 
And then I'll wrap it in a heart-shaped box, filled with rose petals and wishes. 
Don't bother. We're just going to erase it. 
But thanks. Up top. 
Academic catastrophe averted. 
I took the test. Actually, I aced the test. 
Incense, my ass. 
I know my incense. I got five different 
types of incense in my bathroom. 
I got sandalwood, old school musk... 
You've been wanting to do that all day. 
Let's get out of here. 
I still have to finish painting the living room before my dad gets home. 
Someone's coming. Shut up. Let's go. 
Hey, you. 
Motorcycle man. You shouldn't be here. 
Today was fun. 
You want to run? Okay. I got you. 
Oh! 
You. 
 You Tell Cemron that we dating? 
 I had to call an audible. 
 No. 
 He must be so upset. 
Not at all. 
In fact, he wanted to do this whole soundtrack thingie. 
Uh-oh. Chastity's at 6:00. Now 7. She's at 8. 
I can't tell time this fast. 
Hang up the phone. 
Great news, B. Your nerd boy? 
He got me the tape. 
He gave it to you? 
You don't want to watch this. 
Uh, yeah, I do. I do. 
It's already cued up. I wish we had popcorn. 
No, I don't want to wait the three minutes. 
Chastity, listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. 
It's not that big of a deal. There she is. 
I will never forget those roots. Ugh. 
Listen, Chastity, I want you to know that this shouldn't affect our friendship in any way, because what you're going to see is not-- Damn it. 
Security system's crap. Stupid public school. 
I guess we'll never know who she is. 
It'll just remain one of life's mysteries, like Fergie's age. 
I can't be the only person who saw them. 
I mean, you know what? 
We'll start interrogating people. 
Eventually, some nut will crack. 
Chastity, can you just explain to me one teeny, tiny thing? 
You dumped Joey. 
Why do you care who he kissed? 
Because-- Because... 
it's humiliating. 
It didn't even take him a day to get over me. 
When he kissed that sloor, he probably still had the taste of my strawberry ultimate shine lip quencher on his mouth. 
Whoever that girl is, she can't compare to you. 
You are the most popular girl at this school. 
You're the youngest head cheerleader in the history of Padua High. 
You are Chastity freaking Church. 
You're right. 
You're right. I'm me, and she is nothing. 
A nobody. A nasty, mangy piece of garbage. 
Okay. 
Thank you for reminding me how amazing I am. 
I am so glad we're besties. Air hug. 
Oh, and give that back to nerd boy. 
What's your deal? Is someone 
paying you to ruin my life, or is something clinically wrong with you? 
Dad, I had to-- Not another word. 
What did she do now? 
Today's stunt was breaking into school. 
To take an English test. Hush. 
They were going to give me a zero. I said 
Wait, what? You broke into 
school to take a test? 
I know. It's weird. 
And it's going to cost you another mark on your permanent record. 
So let me get this straight. 
You're going to punish my daughter for trying to get a good grade? 
Well, I'm sure as hell not going to reward her for breaching our costly, yet apparently crap, security system. 
Come on. 
If this is the way you treat a good student, what do you do with the bad ones? 
Chain them up to break rocks during recess? 
Just because she's a good student doesn't mean she's good. 
She's in my office more than that boy that randomly bites other kids' necks. Damn this vampire craze. 
Look, Kat is many things Stubborn, intractable, relentless-- Annoying, trouble-making. 
Pardon me, Principal Holland, but if anyone's going to insult my daughter, it's going to be me. 
This girl is a great kid. 
She's smart and soulful, generous and good-hearted. 
She's determined to make a difference in the world, and she will. 
I'm sure of it. 
Yesterday, when she walked out, yes, she broke the rules, but it was 100% the right thing to do. 
She was just defending a poor kid against authority figures who prefer to scare kids into submission, rather than inspire them to greatness. 
I got the other one. 
Man, he's fast. Well, well, well. 
Here's that poor kid now. 
That poor, defenseless kid. 
Cameron, thanks for erasing the tape. 
Consider that your last favor. 
Look, I'm so, so, so sorry. 
I wanted to tell you about Joey, but you weren't speaking to me. 
No, I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry I thought you were this sweet, innocent girl from Ohio, who thinks about puppies as she falls asleep. 
But now I see you're this ruthless vixen who will step on anyone to get what she wants. 
In fact, I bet you hate puppies. 
I love puppies. Not falling for that again. 
Hey, B. You want some fro-yo? 
I got a huge one because I feel like celebrating me. 
Mm, whoever invented sprinkles deserves a gold star. Mm. 
Chastity, I have something to tell you. 
I'm so glad we've become friends, real friends, which makes this so much harder to say, but I have to be honest with you, no matter what happens. 
Uh, well, consider the suspense built. 
I'm the one who kissed Joey. 
So that went well. 
The test grade counts, the suspension's been lifted, and Principal Holland admitted that she didn't have a concussion in front of witnesses. 
Thanks to you, I'm still an Ivy League candidate. 
You're also a liar. What? 
This whole time, you've been telling me this is about your principles. 
You forgot to mention your principles drive a motorcycle. 
So it was Patrick's bag. 
That's not why I left. 
The school violated several Constitutional amendments. 
Dad! Kat! 
Just get in the car and drive. 
What is going on? 
Why are you covered in sprinkles? 
Just drive. 
Go, go, go. Chastity is coming. 
Oh, I will see you at school tomorrow! 
It's important to stay as low as possible... 
because heat rises. 
Heat rises. 
Did you know that? 
No, but maybe if he goes over it another ten times, it'll sink in. 
Pay attention. 
Don't touch that doorknob... 
until you've checked to see if it's hot first. 
What do you know? Look at that. 
Room temperature. You can escape now, Dad. 
Don't wanna be late for the conference. 
The other gynecologists will ice you out. 
 Time to go, Dad. 
 Bye, Dad. 
 Kat, you're in charge. 
 Mmhmm. 
 That means you're responsible for Bianca. 
 Cool. I get to order you around. 
You know what? 
Maybe I'll just skip the conference. 
What else can I learn? The last time I heard, 
babies still come out of the same place. 
Dad, it's healthy for us to spend time apart so we don't get sick of each other. 
I could never be sick of my little girls. 
 Okay. Time to go. 
 Well, all right. 
 Oh, thank you. Thanks. 
 Bye. Love you. 
 I'm gonna miss you. Oh, I left 
 Love you so much, Dad. 
Have a good time. 
Bye-bye. 
It's finally happening. 
An entire weekend without Dad. 
 See you Monday. 
 Yep. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: Oh, do not sell any of our furniture on craigslist. 
I'm just taking "before" pictures. 
Before what? 
I'm having a few friends over... 
and I just wanna make sure I can replicate the "after". 
This is so clich�. 
Dad goes out of town, you throw a wild party... 
someone breaks our Faberg� egg, and... 
then we have to turn this place into a brothel to pay for it. 
Sounds like an awesome weekend. 
Come in. 
Hey, Bianca. 
We are here for karaoke. 
Ohh. 
I know what you're up to. 
I've seen those crappy teen movies. 
Oh, me, too. 
Aren't you supposed to show up much later wearing a hockey mask? 
And you'll be the first to go. 
Come on. 
This is just karaoke. 
Let me guess. Some football drones 
with beer and a spiked watermelon. 
* Five, four, three, two, one * It is only 9:30. This party 
should totally suck right now. 
This is going better than planned. 
If this party turns epic, I could be a legend at Padua High. 
Shane DeMarco graduated four years ago, and people are still talking about his party. 
Hey, blonde girl, is this your party? 
 Uh, yeah, it is. 
 Not bad. 
Strong hot-guy ratio, and some are in college. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 So what's your name? 
Bianca Stratford. 
Tell all your friends. 
Okay. 
 Oh, my God! College guys! 
 Shane DeMarco can eat it! 
Bianca, no more people, or I'm shutting this place down. 
Did you even think about putting out trash cans? 
Move! 
Come on! 
Put your back into it. 
Whoo! 
Okay, when my back wants to touch your front... 
I'll tell you. 
Joey, sweetie... 
 I'm thirsty. 
 Me, too. 
 Oh, I'm on it. 
 Thanks, honey. Love you. Bye. 
Ughh. He's like a puppy 
who hasn't been housebroken. 
Ooh. 
Who are those boys? 
Or should I say men? 
Wow. 
Apparently they go to college. 
Well, I hope they find someone interesting to talk to so they don't get bored. 
All right. 
I'll do it. 
Ooh. If Joey comes back, 
cover for me. 
What? 
I'm curious about college. 
 Seriously... 
 Kat, will you let those people in? 
As soon as three people leave. 
We are at capacity. 
Will you lighten up? 
Our house is hotter... 
than the swag room at a Golden Globe party. 
Dad left me in charge, which means I'm responsible for this party. 
 Have you even organized designated drivers? 
 No. I'm busy hosting. 
Bianca, if Padua students are drinking here... 
which, by the way, is illegal, you're obligated to make sure they're taken care of. 
Don't you remember the moral of Dad's field trip to the morgue? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Drinking, bad. 
I'm not drinking, am I? 
Designated drivers wear these. 
 "Save the naked mole rats"? 
 Left over from that walkathon. 
Apparently people only care about cute endangered species. 
 Stupid pandas. 
 Please let them in. 
We can make them the designated drivers. 
 Ah, congratulations! 
 All right! 
You've been chosen to be designated drivers. 
 What? 
 If I see any of you drinking... 
 I will neuter you. 
 Oh. 
Bummer. 
Heard about your party. 
Did my invite get lost? 
 Speaking of getting lost. 
 Come on. I just wanna talk to you. 
 So talk. 
 Privately. 
Have you seen Chastity? 
The ice in her drink is melting. 
She's over there in the corner talking to some guy. 
 What guy? 
 He's a missionary. 
Don't go over there unless you wanna be saved. 
Come dance with us. 
Whoo! 
Yeah! 
Whoo! 
Oh, I see. When you said, 
"Wait here" at the dance... 
you really meant for, like, six days. 
If you ever returned a phone call, you'd know I didn't bail on you. I got arrested. 
Oh, and here I thought you were just a jerk. 
Turns out you're also a criminal. 
I didn't even do anything. 
The charges were dropped. 
So let it go. 
Don't. 
 Then what do you want from me? 
 Nothing. 
I've seen red flags from you ever since I met you. 
In fact, you look like Communist China. 
What the hell am I doing here? 
It's like talking to a brick wall. 
You make up your mind, and that's that. 
Don't turn this around on me. 
I didn't do anything wrong. 
Oh, of course not. 
You're perfect. 
I am not. 
Have fun up here in your perfect world... 
all by your perfect self. 
Thanks. I will. 
Say hello to your parole officer! 
What is that? 
Get out! Get 
No! No! Hello! 
Get out of there! 
That is my closet! 
It looks like Bianca's in a great mood. 
Maybe now she'll accept my apology. 
Be careful. 
She's happy, not drunk. 
What's the difference? 
Drunk girls do things they normally wouldn't do... 
like forgive people or skinny-dip. 
I'm gonna go wait in the pool. 
Some of these chicks are bound to come around sooner or later. 
I'm gonna talk to Bianca. 
Wish me luck. 
Good luck. 
All right. 
 Tasty watermelon! 
 All right! 
Right after I have a snack. 
Oh, my God, guys. 
Don't drop me. 
Thank God I wore my good underwear tonight. 
Thank God I wore underwear! 
 What are you doing? 
 Shutting down this party. 
I don't think so. 
You know, if you weren't my sister, I'd actually feel bad for you. 
You're incapable of having fun. 
I am not gonna be responsible for your party. 
Then I will be. 
You? You've never been responsible 
for anything in your entire life. 
You remember your hamster? 
Of course I do. 
But Britney Spears was one hamster. 
 I didn't know she had to eat twice a day. 
 What about Gumdrop? 
Fish are easy to forget. 
You know how quiet they are. 
Exactly. 
There's always an excuse. 
So I make mistakes. 
I never claim to be Little Miss Perfect like you. 
Ooh! I am not perfect! 
 Why does everyone keep saying that? 
 Because you act like you are! 
Fine. 
You wanna be in charge of this party? Have at it. 
Now I'm gonna have some fun. 
Little Miss Perfect has just relinquished her crown. 
Oh-ho-ho! 
It's all you! 
Drink up! 
 Whoo! 
 Ahh! 
 Nice! All right! 
 Yeah! 
* I'll make you mine * So before a game, I spray a tiny bit of hair spray on my butt... 
so my leotard won't ride up. 
Unless we're trying to distract the other team... 
and then we skip the hair spray. 
I thought cheerleaders were just vapid cretins... 
but you're actually master strategists. 
Totally. 
 Kat, what are you doing? 
 I'm just hangin'. 
You know, girl-talking about butts and stuff. 
Look at you. 
Maybe you should change your shirt. 
Maybe you should change your face. 
Your sister's cool. 
Bianca, do you or do you not have any energy drinks? 
Yeah. 
No big D, guys, but could you shut the fridge when you're done? 
I need to get amped up, 'cause things are about to go down. 
Wait! What? No, nothing 
and no one should be going down. 
Chastity's not flirting with a missionary, she's flirting with a college dude. 
 Hey, that's my girl, man. 
 Oh. 
Excuse us. So sorry. 
Sorry. Okay. 
Okay, what has gotten into you? 
This is a social function, not Maury Povitch. 
Me? You're the one flirting with 
a college dude right in front of my face! 
Well, maybe I wanted to have a conversation... 
that didn't start with, "Um, do I, like, look fat in this?" 
Hey, as a model, I have to be the boss of my body, and that's a full-time job. 
You think it's easy for me to sit next to you at the movies... 
while you're grubbing on Red Vines and popcorn and gummi worms? 
Joey, sweetie... 
in an effort to support your modeling career... 
I'm gonna let you practice your stupid little runway walk... 
all the way home. 
 Ohh! 
 Excuse me. 
Don't think I won't! 
Loser! 
Uh, okay, everybody. 
Halftime show is over. 
Let's get back to the party. 
Whoo! 
* Lost * * In a dream * * I don't know which * * Way to go * * You are all that you seem * * Way too slow * Ha-ha! 
* I've been a fool before * * My love caught in a slammin' door * * How about some information, please * Yes! Now, everybody 
put your hands together! 
Right? I wanna give a shout-out 
to the naked mole rats. 
Naked mole rats! 
 Who we gonna save? 
 Naked mole rats! 
Naked mole rats! 
Kat, you are out of control. 
We should sing one of the songs with the two people-- when they do it together. 
 A duet? 
 Oh... 
I don't say this often enough, Bianca, but you're so smart and prettiful. 
I love you, Bianca! 
I hope we stay sisters * Forever * I think you should go outside and get some fresh air. 
* Save the naked mole rats * Hey, weren't you in my car once? 
You're Bianca's sister. 
 You're scary. 
 No, don't say that. 
Okay. 
I'm fun, right? 
You'd tell me if I wasn't fun? 
Come on. You're, like, 
the funnest person in the world. 
 I feel fun! 
 I love watermelon! 
Hey. 
I hate myself. 
I'm sure everything with Chastity will be fine. 
You know she can be a bit dramatic. 
No. These-- These had to be 
at least 1,850 calories... 
plus all that sodium... 
I already feel bloated. 
So you'll do an extra hour of cardio tomorrow. 
It's just so hard to be with her sometimes. 
Or-- Or maybe it's me. 
 Maybe I'm a really bad boyfriend. 
 Are you kidding me? 
You're kind and sweet, and you look great in photos. 
You're like... 
the perfect boyfriend. 
Wow. Bianca... 
what you just said to me filled me up more than this bag of Cheeseritos. 
Bianca, come upstairs. 
Something freaky's going on in the toilet. 
I'll be right back. 
Don't eat. 
 No more alcohol. 
 It's just watermelon. 
I don't drink. 
I'm above the influence. 
You're the guy who gets wasted because he's too dumb to know... 
that the watermelon was spiked. 
Maybe those teen movies really are set in reality. 
I'm drunk? 
Oh, I thought it was just 'cause I was depressed... 
'cause Bianca's mad at me, and... 
 you're her sister. 
 Mmhmm. 
How do I get her to forgive me? 
Buy her something that sparkles. 
Oh, a sparkler! 
It doesn't matter anyway. 
Bianca's all, like... 
"Stay out of my life!" 
Yell, yell, yell! 
She won't even let me explain. 
That's not nice. 
I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. 
She probably knows that deep down. 
I bet she wishes she could make out with you right now. 
Really? 
How do you know? 
I just know things in my mind. 
Do you think I should apologize first? 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
You should-- You should do that. 
I have to make a phone call. 
 Yeah! 
 Whoo! Whoo! 
 Yeah! Here, dude! 
 Put the duck down! 
Whoo! 
What are you doing in my uniform? 
This party is so awesome, I heard about it at the North Pole. 
I think I'm gonna be sick. 
Oh! Take it off! 
Bianca, I have to talk to you. 
 Cameron, when did you get here? 
 In time increments? 
Uh, three watermelons ago. 
Your sister is trashed, by the way. 
She's not the only one. 
You need to go home. 
No. 
I've been waiting all night to do this, and you have to listen to me. 
I'm sorry I ruined your date with Beau, but he was not a good person. 
I know, but that doesn't excuse what you did. Stay out of my life. 
I can't. 
I'm in love with you. 
 No, you're not. 
 Yes, I am! 
 But you're gay! 
 I'm not gay... at all! 
In fact, you're gayer than I am because you kissed a girl. 
That was for money. 
See, I could never kiss a guy for money, except for Johnny Depp. 
So all this time we've been friends, you've liked me? 
No. I've loved you. 
Bianca, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you... 
and if it turns out we have afterlives, I wanna spend those together, too. 
Cameron Think about it. We could have a really 
cool moniker, like Biameron or Camianca. 
You pick. 
I-- I don't know how to tell you this, but I don't feel the same way. 
I'm so sorry. 
Maybe we should talk about this when you're sober. 
Um, how about we never talk about this again? 
Will you please take him home? 
No, no, no. Come over 
so I can tell you something. 
Kat, I need you to help. 
Because I need to do it in person. 
Because I just do. Just do it. 
Kat! 
I am on the phone! 
You have got to be kidding me. 
What do you expect me to do, woman? 
The toilet's jacked. 
That is it! 
The party is over! 
Over! Okay, everybody, 
it's time to leave right now! 
Right now! 
Come on! Leave! 
Please? Please? Please? 
It's time to go... away! 
Five-head, look what I found. 
Someone barfed in it. 
Hey, it's okay. We can get it out. 
Do you have a Shop-Vac? 
Joey, I think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. 
This party is out of control. 
I'm a victim of my own success. 
 How did Shane DeMarco do it? 
 Tell me how I can help. 
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it. 
 I just want this party to be over. 
 Well, then, let's get her done. 
Come on. 
I'm sorry. 
Uh, can you guys get up for a sec? 
Apparently somebody who was in here has crabs. 
Oh, my God! 
They're everywhere! 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, they're everywhere! 
It worked. 
Everyone's gone. 
I know. That was amazing. 
Up top. 
 That didn't happen. 
 I know. 
But... if it did, 
it was amazing. 
Too bad it didn't. 
Has anybody seen my clothes? 
You'd never know there was a raging party here last night... 
except for in my head. 
Oh, God, the pain. 
I was up all night. 
I even steam-cleaned the carpets, no thanks to you! 
Inside voices. 
Here. 
Drink this. 
Thank you. 
"I heart Patrick"? 
 Some jerk wrote on me. 
 Don't look at me. 
You're the one who called him last night and begged him to come over. 
 Oh, my God, what did I say? 
 Why don't you ask him? 
I was busy playing the role of the girl who learns to be responsible. 
Guess who played the girl who gets drunk and makes an ass of herself? 
No. 
It's Dad. Uh, go upstairs 
and take a shower. 
Yeah. Okay. Go. 
Shower time. 
 I am never drinking again. 
 Uhhuh. 
Thanks for indulging me with this movie night. 
I missed you girls this weekend, and... 
I just wanted a nice Sunday night together. 
We missed you, too, Dad. 
All we did was sit around and ponder how much. 
 That's why my brain hurts. 
 Aw. 
So, what movie are we gonna watch? 
It's called House Party... 
and it was shot by this hip new director named Mr. Duck. 
Now, everybody put your hands together! 
Right? I wanna 
give a shoutout to Settle in, girls. 
We've got four hours ahead of us. 
 What are we gonna save? 
 Naked mole rats! 
I think we should give it a shot. 
I do, too. Is that what this is? 
Your master plan to get me to sleep with you? 
I love you, Bianca. Oh, my God. I love you, too. 
Just because I want to have sex doesn't mean I should. 
I've been fooled by guys like you before, but not his time. 
I'm on The Biggest Poser. 
I leave for New York tomorrow. 
I miss my boyfriend. 
Joey left two days ago. 
I can still smell his body spray. 
That's because I'm wearing it. 
To remember him.- He's not dead. He's just on 
 a reality TV show, which is probably worse. 
At least there's dignity in death. 
Could you show a little compassion? 
This is his locker. 
We shared so many kisses here. 
Here's a novel idea, why don't you call him? 
Then he can listen to this instead of me. 
I can't. He's sequestered in the model house, 
and they only have one phone. 
Last night, some girl told Joey to hang up or she'd scratch his face. 
I'd give anything to hear the sound of his voice. 
The Buddha says, "Desire is the root of all suffering." 
Thanks, fortune cookie. 
Is that supposed to make me feel better? 
The fact that you want Joey to call is creating the pain you're feeling right now. 
So what? I shouldn't 
want him to call me? 
Exactly. 
So you're not dying to talk to Patrick about the other night? 
If I wanted to talk to him about it, I'd call him. 
He's not in a model house. 
I'm walking my path, and he's walking his. 
I wish him well. 
You're so deluded. 
Whoa, wait a second. 
Why is Dad talking to Miss Tharp? 
Maybe he worried you're an android.  
Oh, my God, they're dating. 
âª Hey, hey âª Bianca, calm down. Try and imagine we're bamboo 
gently bending in the wind. 
And hurricane Tharp is about to rip us to shreds. 
We don't know they're dating. 
Maybe they were reminiscing about your fake intervention. 
I am an expert on fliy dy language. 
She did the hair flip/arm squeeze which means they've been on two dates and they've made out with tongue. 
What are we going to do about this unholy union? 
We support Dad. 
We've been wanting him to date for years, remember? 
Someone age-appropriate who workat the hospital, not the crazy lady from school with zero boundaries. 
Dad's coming. 
If you say anything, I will hurt you. 
I thought Buddhists were nonviolent. 
I'm a beginner. Hi, girls. 
Hi, Daddy. Hi, Dad. 
How was your day? 
Uneventful. Yep. 
They ran this guy's shorts up the flagpole at lunch. 
That was funny. 
And then we saw you flirting with Miss Tharp. 
Bianca. 
She thinks you two are dating. 
What? That's absurd. 
Alright, I'm not going to lie to you. 
We've been on two dates. 
Told you. 
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner, but I wanted to wait till I knew it was something special. 
See, Bianca? 
It's nothing special. 
Actually, it is. 
Or it could be. 
I don't know. 
She's funny and surprising and 20 years ynger than you and our guidance counselor and a weirdo. 
She's different, and like her. 
And when I'm around her, I feel alive again. 
You know how, like, when your foot goes asleep and you shake it and it gets tingly? 
Ew, now you're bringing feet into this? 
Girls, you know yore the mo important things in my life. 
I won't date Miss Tharp if you tell me not to. 
Okay, then don't. 
All right. 
I'llust be really sad. 
But that's okay because your happiness is more important than mine. 
Dad, we would never dream doing something so selfish. 
Would we, Bianca? 
Why don't you invite her over for dinner so that we can get to know her better? 
Really? 
  It's Darlene. Should Iet it ring one more time 
and not be too eager? 
Or what if she hangs up? 
Darlene, are you there? 
Oh, hi. Nothing. 
And breathe... in through theight nostril 
and out through the left. 
Everyone, slowly return from nothingness. 
Now, I know our meditation collective has no official leader, but I have a few announcements. 
First of all, welcome, Kat Stratford. 
Kat, we're excited to be a part of your journey. 
Namaste. 
Namaste. 
Second, there are still a few spots open on our study abroad trip to Nepal. 
Anyone else like to join us? 
I'm in. 
Wonderful. I'll get you 
the paperwork. 
 Oh, my God, Joey, I miss you so much. 
 I miss you more than my mom. 
I can't wait to hear about all your modeling adventures, but first, I have to tell you about the insanity I'm dealing with. 
My dad is dating Miss Tharp. No way. 
Nice job, Dr. Stratford. 
Joey, this is not good news. 
Old people settle down fast so that they won't die alone. 
What if she becomes my stepmom? 
Calm down, Bianca. 
Here's what you should do. 
I have to call my baby girl before bedtime. 
Joey? 
Joey, are you there? 
Why do they only have one phone? 
Okay, come on. You can do it. 
Swim upstream, little salmon. 
Is there any way I can persuade you to keep moving? 
I think we both know the answer to that. 
What's this? 
It's an invite to my little sister's birthday party. 
Princess theme. She asked me to... 
All right, it's a love poem for Dawn, okay? 
Did you write it in calligraphy? 
So what if I did? Look, last night 
on the phone without thinking, I said, "I got to get some Z's, Dawn," but I don't know if she was done talking. 
Now I feel horrible. 
So I wrote her a poem to apologize. 
For saying good night? 
Nice backbone. 
Well, better to tell Dawn how I feel than let her get away. 
That's the moral of every romantic comedy. 
There. Now she'll know 
how I feel in iambic pentameter. 
Sorry. 
What a lovely home. 
Thank you. 
It's so inviting. 
It's like I'm on the set of Friends. 
Jennifer. 
Bianca, you love Friends. 
Why don't you discuss this shared interest while I check the lasagna? 
Hey, did you hear Friends got canceled? 
Yes, but people love it in reruns. And you know why I think that is? 
Urban tribes are now a substitute for traditional families. 
Yeah, plus it's funny. 
I'm sorry I'm late. 
I was meditating. 
Dad, can I talk to you about an amazing opportunity? 
Kat, I have no interest in a timeshare right now, especially when we have a guest. 
Oh, hi, Miss Tharp. 
Namaste. 
Namaste, Kat. 
Dad, I want to go to Nepal. 
And I'm sure someday you will. 
How about next week? 
Huh? 
There's a school sanction program where I'd spend three months in a remote village in the Himalayas helping them build a school. 
Plus, the trip is led by university faculty members who'll teach courses in East Asian history. 
And the best part daily mediation at a monastery with real Buddhist monks. 
That sounds like the perfect trip for someone else's daughter. 
Let her go. I'll turn 
her room into a gym. 
I know that program, Walter. 
It's very well run. 
Not only do the students achieve a higher level of consciousness, but it looks great on a college application. 
Don't say no yet. 
Just think about it. 
I will. 
After dinner. Would you 
take a seat, please? 
So, Miss Tharp, have you ever been married? 
Bianca, what kind of a question is that? 
No, it's okay, Walter. 
I want this to be an open forum where we can all share our truths. 
Great. So have you? 
I have been engaged three times four if you count this one night in Vegas. 
But I haven't actually quite made it down the aisle. 
Oh, why not? 
Bianca. 
Well, it's a question I am currently trying to figure out in therapy. 
Enough questions. 
This is a family dinner, not a deposition. 
Dad, I'm just trying to hear Miss Tharp's truth. 
 So have you ever been arrested? 
 Biance! 
Bianca! 
What? 
Yes, but I was young and naive. 
Girls, please learn from my mistake. 
If a cute man asks you to carry a package over the border, don't do it. 
Don't ever do what cute men want, unless it's me. 
 Oh, my God, Joey? 
 Babe, I've been missing... 
Give that back, Dad. 
Bianca, we have a dinner guest. 
You can talk to Joey later. 
No, I can't. 
You just sit there and be polite or go to your room. 
I've been waiting for him to call all day. 
You're ruining my life. 
Darlene, I'm sorry. 
Bianca can be a bit over-dramatic. 
A bit? It's like she's living in a telenovela. 
Let's not let it ruin our meal. 
May I come in? 
I don't mean to be rude, but I don't want to share my truth or do mirror work or do any of that crap. 
I just want to be alone. 
I can tell how much you miss him. 
I love him. 
And he's gone. 
And who knows when the model phone will be free again. 
Oh, I remember what it feels like to be your age and in love. 
His name was Diego. 
When he got deported, I thought my life was over. 
And the worst part about it nobody took my pain seriously. 
They're so insensitive. 
I'm sure they're doing their best, but not everybody's equipped to give us what we need. 
I'm here. 
I'm a good listener. 
Thanks, Miss Tharp. 
Oh, please call me Darlene. 
So how long have you guys been together? 
We've been together for about two months. 
Okay, Darlene, here I come. 
1, 2, 3. 
Oh, my God, I can't believe we're wearing the same thing. 
You look so cute. 
So do you. 
Here. I made you 
some Nepalese tea. 
Or chaia, as the Sherpas say. 
Katarina, I'm not going to give you my blessing to go halfway around the world Correction. 
Only 12,130 kilometers, give or take a few. 
Oh, is that all? 
I didn't realize you could come home on weekends. 
I know it's far, but this is an amazing opportunity. 
And I'll be going off to college in 18 months. 
Consider this a dress rehearsal. 
For a play I don't want to see. 
I'm ready for this. 
Please don't keep me from going because you're scared. 
I'm not scared. 
I'm terrified. 
Of what? 
Of what? You're going to a place 
without indoor plumbing or telephones or parental supervision. 
It's dangerous. 
Some warlord's going to pay seven goats for you. 
Seven goats? 
Yes. 
Dad, you can just say no. 
You don't have to insult me. 
Please let me go. 
Let you? 
I've never let you do anything in your life. 
It's always been one of my favorite things about you. 
Are you saying what I think you're saying? 
Please don't celebrate till you're alone in your room. 
All right. 
Thanks, Dad. 
And don't come back with one of those rings through your nose. 
Hey Joey, I'm in my new class. 
Hey, Good news I made it to four out of my six "go sees." 
Oh, that's so-- Oh, goody, a bejeweled cell phone. 
Just what I always wanted. 
But, Mr. Meanly, 
it's a matter of life or death. 
 Hey. Hey back. 
That's a really good look for you. 
Thanks. I got it for my trip to Nepal. 
I leave next week. 
For three months. 
It's this fascinating study  abroad program. Cool. Have fun. 
You, too. 
Your poem is the most romantic thing any guy's ever done for me. 
Even that time Chris Yuscratched my name on his guitar. 
I just wanted you to know I couldn't live without you. 
Aw, recite it to me again. 
Hark, my Dawn. 
You are the sweetest treat in the candy store. 
I've tasted your sugar, and I want some more. 
You're so hot you melt my heart. 
Lips, sweet and delicious, like a mixed fruit tart. 
You're cuter than Bambi, an adorable baby fawn. 
You light up my days, my very own Dawn. 
Check out all that natural beauty. 
Eyeball exploding, right? 
You guys are in for the journey of a lifetime. 
Maybe even a few lifetimes. 
That's a little Buddhist humor. 
Sindu, that is too funny. 
I find your spirit infectious. 
Thanks. 
You're welcome. 
Do you know our host families? 
I'd like to start practicing pronouncing their names. 
The families live in one-room huts. 
It's a little crowded, so we'll be sleeping in tents. 
But it'll be spring, so you know what that means. 
It won't be too cold? Avalanche season. 
But don't worry. 
You'll each have a GPS tracker. 
I haven't lost a student yet. 
Just a toe. 
Now, let's talk vaccinations. 
You'll need hepatitis A and B, typhoid, and tetanus, but good news, because of the new well we dug last quarter, you'll no longer need the Japanese encephalitis booster. 
One thing we can't vaccinate against is dysentery. 
I really wish we could, though. 
But we can't. Questions? 
It's a non-invasive process that will really help you access your, I hate to interrupt, but this is an emergency. 
Oh, okay, just give me a sec, Tanya, and then we'll start the hypnosis. 
Hey, what is going on, honey? 
Joey called during math class, and Mr. Meanly took my phone away. 
Darlene, please help me get it back. 
Bianca, honey, in this office, I'm not Darlene. 
I'm Miss Tharp. 
And Miss Tharp has to support Mr. Meanly. 
You should not be talking on the phone during class. 
But you know how hard it's been for me to not talk to Joey. 
Yesterday you called us star-crossed lovers. 
And Darlene was serious about that. 
Really? 
Because it sounds like she was just sucking up to me so she could date my dad. 
No, she would never do that. 
In fact, if you want to process this tonight over a pint of ice cream and a Katherine Heigl movie, Darlene will be there. 
Tell Darlene I said "Thanks for nothing." 
Bianca, be reasonable. 
I am being reasonable, Dad. 
She's the one with multiple personality disorder. 
Darlene said you were just upset because she wouldn't give you your phone back. 
I'd hardly call that a severe mental illness. 
This isn't about my phone. 
It's the fact that she's my guidance counselor and your girlfriend. 
It's too confusing. 
All right, why don't we just invite her over? 
And we'll share our truths. 
After all , if there can be a lasting peace in Northern Ireland I'm sure we can work this out. 
Dad, you don't get it. 
I don't want to work this out. 
Now, please just leave me to my homework. 
Bianca, wha-- It's too strange. 
You said if we didn't want you to date her, you'd stop. 
So stop. 
Okay, fine. 
See you in our next class, okay? 
Siena, hey. 
Hi. 
Listen, I haven't been able to find quick-drying snow pants anywhere. 
Where did you get yours? 
Oh, Kat, I didn't tell you? 
I'm not going to Nepal. 
You're not? 
I realized I don't like hiking, which means I'll probably hate trekking. 
But have fun. Take pictures. 
Hey. 
Hey back. 
I'm glad I caught you before you left for Nepal. 
Really? Why? 
Keith found this in the back of his van. 
I know how much you like it. 
Thanks. 
I was wondering where it was. 
In Keith's van. 
Yeah, you said that. 
I guess I'll see you around. 
Have a safe trip. 
Joey, I miss you so much. 
I miss you more. 
Co Liviette just fainted during our photo shoot, so we have the phone until she revives. 
Then she's going to want to call her baby. 
Goody, I hope she's out for a while. 
We have so much to catch up on. 
Tomorrow's makeover day. I'm so nervous. 
What if they shave my head? 
I don't know how to work my skull. 
Joey, there's something I have to do right now. 
Call me back later, okay? 
But-- Love you. Bye. 
I'm on the other end. 
Yo, Tom, I thought you brought it. 
You've got style. 
You were sexy. 
Looks good. Can I have some? 
Don't choke on it. 
Look. I'm sorry I freaked out 
about Darlene. 
I was being selfish. 
Was? 
You mean you're not being selfish anymore? 
Listen, I know how it feel to want to talk to someone so badly it hurts. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I call her? 
Yeah, but... 
I'm switching to the other guidance counselor. 
Deal. |Joey 
Don't worry about your makeover. 
I told you she'd come around. 
Listen, are you free to see a movie this weekend? 
I have seen you model enough to know you're a chameleon. 
What are you doing out here? 
The program recommends we try out all our equipment before the trip. 
Can I ask you something weird? 
Where will you go to the bathroom up there? 
Oh, God. You're so brave, Kat. 
I could never go to someplace halfway around the world where I didn't know a soul or speak the language or have any idea what I'm eating, but it all sounds so exciting and exotic. 
I don't want to go. 
I like indoor plumbing. 
I don't want to forage for roots or wear snow pants. 
And-- And what? 
And he didn't try to stop me. 
I'm stopping you. 
I need you here. 
Dad is still dating our guidance counselor, and based on their body language, they're three dates away from having sex. 
And pop, pop, pop, pop! 
Pop, pop, pop, pop! 
Turn, pop, pop, pop, pop! 
Pop, pop, pop Ladies, I feel like I'm trapped inside a jell-o factory. 
Dawn, your booty needs to pop like that whitehead on your chin. 
Ah, look. 
Someone who doesn't look like Jessica Simpson having a seizure. 
Finally. 
Great form. 
Firm and crisp. 
Um, I'll handle the critiques. 
You handle the football. 
Bye-bye. 
Bye-bye. 
Bianca, hi. 
Why are you not in your penguin suit? 
Good question. 
I thought I'd learn the routine because God forbid someone gets sick... 
or hurt or pregnant. 
Thanks a lot, Juno. 
Ooh. Yeah. 
You're the mascot. 
Embrace it or end up the girls' manager of the softball team, okay? 
Gather around, girls. 
Gather around. 
Now, you all elected me head cheerleader. 
And me vice head cheerleader. 
Where was I? 
You all elected me... 
head cheerleader on a platform of change. 
And not just superficial change, like featuring our hot girls more... 
but a massive redirection of our cheer program. 
And today, at this very moment, change has come to our squad. 
Introducing the pom-pay. 
A pom-pom so hot, it erupts with school spirit. 
The latest in cheer technology, and we are the only squad in the state who has them. 
Megan, enough. 
They're a hundred bucks a pair. 
Bring me checks by the pep rally, okay? 
Um, Chastity... 
some of our parents already feel the uniforms are too expensive. 
 We can't ask for more money. 
 Seriously? 
Okay, raise your hand if you're poor. 
We could have a fund-raiser. 
 Yeah, I don't have time for  I'll plan everything. Don't worry. 
It'll be great. 
I promise. 
Okay. Ooh. 
But no bake sale. 
The last thing this school needs is more fat people. Mmm. 
My hero. 
What else can you open? 
Finally! 
A fully formed female. 
I am so over freshmen. 
I do not find retainers hot. 
What the hell are you doing in here? 
My doctor says I suffer from gender confusion. 
Are you confused that a fully formed female could kick your ass? 
Oh, no. I'm confused about 
how to get into your pants. 
Ohh! 
Ooh! 
Such a tigress. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: Blah. 
Are you watching that documentary on animal testing again? 
I'd rather be looking at bunnies without eyelids... 
than these yearbook photos I took today. 
It looks like one of those herpes commercials where everyone is so happy... 
despite the fact that they have herpes. 
Herpes. 
I know firsthand that's nothing to smile about. 
I'm a gynecologist. 
* What a waste of time the thought crossed my mind * * But I never missed a beat * * Can't explain the who or what I was * * Trying to believe * * What would you do? * 
 Kat, I need your help. 
 Finally. 
The first step is admitting you have a problem. 
The next step is making you a brunette again. 
Oh, my God. 
That's so funny. 
I need help thinking up a fund-raiser. 
 A fundraiser? 
 A fundraiser? 
Yeah, all I could think of is those commercials for the skinny kids in Africa. 
Okay, I'm gonna let that offense go since this is for charity. 
 What do you need to raise money for? 
 New pompoms. 
 Okay, I'm done here. 
 Why don't you try a car wash? 
I remember the summer before sophomore year Something really boring happened. 
Awesome story, dad. 
A car wash? I love it. 
Thanks, daddy. 
Great idea, dad. 
Half-naked cheerleaders... 
wet and soapy, standing on the street asking for money. 
 No car wash. No car wash! 
 Daddy! 
Can you get it? 
Did I ever tell you about the cakewalk for the badminton club? 
 Multiple times. 
 Dad, it's your girlfriend. 
Mail me to another family. 
Okay. But first, 
here's your dad's package. 
I don't wanna think about my dad's package. 
Carla, hi. 
She's adorable. 
Don't let her fool you. 
She's 15. She's dangerous. 
Oh, I was the same way. 
Oh, now the only thing dangerous in my life is the chance... 
that one of these packages has anthrax in it. 
 You didn't order any, did you? 
 Oh, uh, no. I was... 
uh, it's a model plane. 
That is sweet. 
Here's your toy. 
"Toy"? Model planes 
are collectors' items. 
Oh. 
That I stage fake dog fights with. 
And who am I to judge? 
I am hooked on guitar hero. 
I like to pretend I'm Stevie Nicks. 
Well, before she started looking like a Wiccan bag lady. 
Guitar hero, huh? 
What is that? 
It's this guitar karaoke thingy. 
You should come over sometime... 
see for yourself. I got two guitars. 
We could, uh, form a band. 
I'd love to, but I'm in a band already. 
Of course you are. 
Lesson learned. 
Do not hit on a man wearing rubber gloves. 
Enjoy your package. 
On behalf of all of us at World Send Delivery, have a pleasant day. 
Should we talk about what just happened here? 
I'd love to. But wait. 
What's that I hear? 
Bunnies crying. 
 Did you understand what I said? 
 See, that's the problem. 
Great with the repeating, not so great with the understanding. 
But I'm guessing it was about flowers. 
Props for bringing props, by the way. 
 Actually, those are for  A carnation sale! 
That's perfect. 
You're a genius, Cameron! 
I gotta start planning. 
I almost took your flowers. 
How rude. 
Sacre bleu. 
So I can't wait for you to see me in action with these new pom-poms. 
I just have to figure out how to wear my hair with them, you know? 
They have volume like my hair. 
But I just don't want it to seem like I'm trying to have my hair match the pom-poms, you know? 
Joey, honey, I'm talking. 
 Well, thanks to the padua cheer squad... 
 Sorry sorry. This sounds important. 
...now you can, with one of these 
beautiful carnations. 
Red is for romance, yellow for friendship. 
Each fragrant blossom is only $2. 
And all the money collected goes to a very important cause The feed the skinny children pom-pom memorial foundation. 
Don't wait. Tell that special someone 
just how you feel. 
Okay, let's go. 
 Bye, Stacie. Bye, Mandy. 
 Bye. 
Use that last one. I had pouty lips 
with just a hint of teeth. 
Oh, too bad. I think I saw a glare 
from your devil horns, Beelzebub. 
Okay, I don't know what that means, but I'm offended. 
You're sowing fear and misery among the student body... 
 just so you can buy new pompoms. 
 First, I don't sew... 
and second, I'm giving people a chance to tell someone they care. 
It's actually kind of nice of me. 
This is high school. 
People don't tell each other how they feel. 
That's what I thought. 
But it turns out they really want to. 
After all, we made over $400 today, and I'm sure we'll double that... 
once people have a chance to steal from their parents. 
People aren't buying flowers to tell people they care. 
They're hoping somebody's gonna buy them one back. 
Nobody wants to be the one loser in the school without a flower. 
Waa, waa. Sounds like somebody's afraid 
she's not gonna get one. 
Please. I don't need a stupid flower 
to feel good about myself. 
 That's your department. 
 Wow. That's so not true. 
So what happens tomorrow if you don't get a flower? 
I'll just go home sick... 
and never come back. 
Thanks. 
 Two. 
 Ooh. 
Two carnations, $4. 
Thank you. 
 Red or yellow? 
 It would be red. 
One red carnation, please. 
And I've already filled out the tag. 
I like to be prepared. 
Must be that boy scout training. 
Two dollars. 
Thank you. 
Cameron, how's it going? 
Oh, not so good. 
I feel weird. 
Ever since Bianca got here, my head has been filled with rainbows and Enya. 
The sooner I tell her how I feel, the sooner I can get back to normal. 
Wow. You actually think 
you have a shot. 
I applaud that positive attitude. 
Thanks, P. Diddy. 
I, uh, cashed one of my bar mitzvah savings bonds so I could buy 100 flowers. 
 You don't know that many girls. 
 They're all for me. 
Ooh. 
That seems not right. 
No. No, Cameron, it's inspired. 
When the girls see me carrying all these flowers, they'll wonder... 
"Who's that guy?" 
Yeah? 
Or they'll think you're a float. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Cameron. 
 I'm here for my shift. 
 Oh, thank God! 
Hopefully this is the last time I'll ever have to handle money. 
 Credit is so much cleaner. 
 Yeah. 
I've been dying to see if anyone sent me a flower. 
I guess it's one of the perks of being on the squad, huh? 
 We get to peek. 
 Oh, darn! 
You're the mascot. 
You don't have security clearance. 
But I planned this whole thing. 
So this must be shocking news for you. 
Damn our strict intelligence policy. 
But we can't change the rules for you or we'd have to change them for everyone... 
and then the terrorists win. 
 I'm confused. 
 I'll bet you are. 
I'll see you at the pep rally, okay? Bye. 
One carnation. 
Two dollars. 
I'll just take that right there. 
If Bobby doesn't send me a flower, I swear I'll never give him a lap dance again. 
Mind making room for someone who actually wants to use the sink? 
Wait your turn. 
Oh! Yearbook photo girl. 
Want a pic? 
Thanks, but I have plenty of shots of girls who desperately need... 
attention from boys to prop up their self-esteem. 
Bye-bye. 
That was awesome. 
It's like your mouth knows kung fu. 
High school is like Vietnam, and these stupid flowers are Agent Orange. 
So you're not hoping to get one? 
Not even a teeny, tiny bit? 
From who? 
Every guy here has the depth of an inflatable kiddie pool. 
What about Patrick Verona? 
I would rather lick that toilet seat. 
Why would you even ask me that? 
I just saw him in line buying a flower, that's all. 
That's impossible. 
He would never Kat, other woman, just pretend I'm not here... 
especially if you were changing. 
Mandella, pervy troll. 
Pervy troll, Mandella. 
Let's go. 
Ah. 
Is that it? 
That can't be it. 
Are you sure? 
It's okay. 
I showed you my flower. 
Now you show me yours. 
Leave me alone! 
Just take this one and shut up. 
 You girls are late. Where were you? 
 We were having sex with the soccer team. 
 It took longer than expected. 
 Funny. Young lady, come back 
Dad, usually I enjoy this, but this time let it go. 
She's had a tough day. 
Nobody sent her a stinking carnation. 
Oh. I see. 
I'm sorry, are you experiencing sympathy? 
Don't get me wrong. 
She really shouldn't let someone else's opinion affect her like this. 
Who cares if some guy she's barely met didn't spend two bucks to buy her a flower? 
I mean, really, all she knows about this guy is that he's rumored to be a cannibal. 
Still, when she didn't get one, it upset her. 
But what's even more upsetting is that she let herself care in the first place. 
She's so pathetic. 
Poor Bianca. 
I'm gonna go tell her that she's right. 
No guy should be able to make her doubt how amazing she is. 
But I'm also going to tell her... 
that part of high school is getting hurt. 
There's no way to avoid it. 
She's just gonna have to learn to pick herself up and move on. 
You should tell her that. 
She'd really appreciate it. 
But to have any credibility at all, you might wanna take off your wedding ring. 
I can't believe it! 
 Hey, Karen, want a flower? 
 Uhuh. 
I got way too many yesterday. 
Later. 
Michael, what are you doing? 
They waited until last period to pass out all the carnations, so nobody saw me with these. 
So I'm gonna get my money's worth. 
Speaking of, was Bianca's flower worth your two bucks? 
I haven't heard from her, but I'm choosing to be positive. 
She's repulsed by me but cares enough to not reject me in public. 
 That's one theory. 
 Nice basket, dork! 
Good one, Ryan. 
You got me. 
 Hey, Bianca. 
 I'm in such a crappy mood, Cameron. 
Cheer me up, and I'll love you forever. 
I'll do my best. 
Did-- did you like my flower? 
 You sent me a flower? 
 You didn't get it? 
No, but this is great news. 
It is? 
Well, if you sent me a flower, that means other people may have, too. 
Okay. Ouch. 
Chastity must've thrown them away. 
I knew it. 
She's still upset about finding me and Joey in the closet. 
Yeah, it was upsetting. 
But destroying someone's flowers That's low. 
Even for a popular girl. 
Kat was right. 
She is a teenage Long Duk Dong. 
 I'm sorry, who? 
 The dictator of North Korea. 
It's okay. 
I didn't know, either. 
She shouldn't get away with this. 
 You should call her out on it. 
 She'd kick me off the squad. 
Or maybe others would follow you. 
 You could start a rebellion. 
 Why would they follow me? 
You don't even realize your effect on people. 
They're drawn to you. 
They wanna be around you all the time, forever and ever... 
but not in a creepy way. 
Thanks, Cameron. 
So you'll still be my friend if I have to join show choir? 
Of course I will. And, uh, the AV club's 
always looking for new members. 
God, let's hope it doesn't come to that. 
Ouch. 
Oh, and, Cameron, thanks for the flower. 
Get it through your head. 
I'm not interested. 
Gotcha. 
Oh, my God! 
These pom-pays are amazing! 
 Whoo! 
 Ten minutes, girls. 
You heard her. 
Ten minutes. 
Can I have everyone's attention, please? 
Someone in this group has betrayed me. 
In fact, she's betrayed the bonds of cheerleader sisterhood... 
and what makes it so much worse... 
is that that person is in a position of leadership. 
 Chastity, I have something to say. 
 And what would that be, mascot? 
Michelle said you're too fat to be on top of the pyramid. 
No! What? No! 
I didn't say that! 
No! Girls, back me up. 
No, she kind of did, really loud. 
May I speak with you? 
Outside? 
No, they're taking it out of context. I mean, 
the next thing I said was, "just kidding". 
 So, no... 
 Outside. 
Ooh, she's gonna get it. 
That was awesome. 
 I have a package here for Dr. Stratford. 
 That's me. Where's Carla? 
Uh, she wanted to swap routes. 
It's fine by me. 
There are a lot of foxy stay-at-home moms on this block. 
Well, if you see her, tell her... 
good luck. 
Excuse me. 
Which way are the foxy moms? 
Shame on you. 
You're married. 
Let me guess, Officer. 
I should be wearing a helmet. 
I just have one thing to say to you: I'm not that girl. 
What girl? 
The girl who's turned on by this bad-boy crap. 
I'm not skipping home to scribble in my journal that maybe you're a vampire. 
Noted. 
You don't have to beat people up for me. 
I can do that myself. 
Oh, I'm sure you can. 
But I didn't beat anybody up. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Scout's honor. 
Now, do you mind? 
Helmet! 
I'm sorry, what? 
What was that all about? 
I don't even know. Come on. 
Let's get out of this hellhole. 
I wish I could, but I've got detention. 
 They finally found your graffiti? 
 Um, yeah. 
Bummer. All right. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Can't wait. 
 Good bye. 
Previously On: "10 Things i Hate About You"... 
Stop seeing that dee p-voiced man-boy. 
Dad, you don't even know him. 
You're right. 
Invite him over for dinner. 
You break up with him, and I'll give you your life back. 
If you don't come over, he says we can't hang out. 
You are nowhere near qualified to see my daughter. Get out. 
Get out. 
Dad, we made all of that up. 
You've been punked. 
This past week with you has been amazing. 
You're not choosing me? 
I broke up with Joey so we could stay friends, and then I got back with him a second later, because I realized real friends would never make me choose between them and my totally hot, wonderful new boyfriend. 
You said yourself, you don't even know this guy. 
If I learn he's bad news, he's gone. 
So there's no actual meat in this meatloaf? 
No, just lentils. 
   Please be a pizza. 
Oh, it's Joey. 
Watch this and learn. 
I'm sorry, young man, but if you'd like to see Bianca, visiting hours are from 3: 30 to 5:00 on Tuesdays. 
I've actually come to see you, sir. 
It is my hope... 
That you'll grant me permission to date your daughter. 
Here's my driving record, vaccination card, and a list of references. 
They can't be-- Friends, family or fake. I know, sir. 
Did you put him up to this? 
Good girl. 
Let's go to my study and make some calls. 
If they all check out, I'll need an itinerary for your date. 
Is your phone GPS-enabled? 
Wasn't that so romantic? 
So romantic. Maybe they'll 
negotiate your dowry while they're at it. 
How many camels do you think you're worth? 
You're just jealous. I'm nauseous. 
It's the "Meatloaf". At least 
Joey asked me out on a real date. 
Has Patrick ever asked you? 
Look, if I wanted to go on a date with him, I'd ask him myself. 
Feminism, ever heard of it? 
isn't that the thing that killed romance? 
English Version By YesCool - ADDIC7ED.COM Team! 
Thank God it's Friday. 
Or, if you're an atheist, thank the spinning rotation of the Earth. 
I'm sorry, did I offend you again? 
It's all right, I'm used to it. 
Don't get me started on the pledge of allegiance. 
Big plans this weekend? 
I think I'll check out this new documentary on the private life of plants. 
Sounds kind of scandalous. 
You are one weird chick. 
Have an educational weekend. 
Maybe we can hang out. 
Well, I am really busy, so if you want to hang out, maybe we should set a time. 
Are you asking me on a date? 
I'm just saying, if you give me a time frame, maybe I can fit you in. 
 How about tonight? 
 A more specific time frame. 
Does 7 work, or will you be watching your plant movie? 
7's fine. It's a-- Deal. 
Oh, hey, Hacksaw Manor 4 opens tonight. You want to go? 
Sorry, dude, it's the Sabbath. 
No electricity allowed. 
You never observe the Sabbath. 
Nana's visiting. 
Got to jet. Mom's making 
me pick up the challah. 
So where are you taking me tonight? 
I'll give you a hint. 
These are knives. 
We're going to see Hacksaw Manor? 
No, Benihana. 
He's taking her to Benihana? 
That's where he took me on our first date. 
Okay, Joey's pathetic. 
He totally lacks imagination. 
I'm bored with this topic. Hey, do 
you want to go see Hacksaw Manor 4 tonight? 
As much as I would love to see aristocrats torn to shreds, I have a date tonight. 
Fine. I know Janelle 
wants to see it. 
She hates aristocrats because her family's poor. 
Um, Janelle and her boyfriend are busy tonight, too. 
We're sort of going on a double date, but you could totally come, too. 
And be the fifth wheel? No, 
thank you. 
I was invited to, like, four different parties tonight, and one of them is at a celebrity's house. 
I wish I could tell you who, but the church of Scientology might get upset. 
Totes. All right, I'll see you. 
Okay. 
Mark this day in your calendar, Bianca. I am asking you for advice. 
 Burn them. 
 I'm serious. 
So am I. You can't wear 
those on your date, and you can't wear that ponytail, either. 
Guys only find those sexy on cheerleaders. 
A, what? And B, it's not a date. 
At least, I don't think so. 
You don't know? Would you 
just help me pick the shoes? 
Well, did you ask him or did he ask you? 
That part's a little unclear. 
See, this is what you really needed advice about. 
Here's how you know if it's a date If he's made a plan, and if he pays. 
I'm sorry, did I just stumble into Mad Men? 
Trust me, those women knew when they were on a date. 
I got your 911 text. 
What's the emergency? 
I can't decide between these two earrings. 
A true crisis. 
 Daring or distracting? 
 Way distracting. 
That's what I thought. 
Thank God you're here. 
Come on, let's lip gloss. 
Are you so excited? 
Joey is such a catch. 
And Chastity always said he's amazi in bed. 
Athletic, sensual and hygienic. 
Oh, my God. Do you think 
he expects sex tonight? 
I doubt it. I mean, 
it's the first date. 
This may be California, but we still have some standards. 
Did you do it on your first date with Mr. Ross? 
Crap. 
Joey still thinks I had sex with my teacher. 
Because you did. 
Oh. You still think I did, too. 
Um, look, Dawn... 
Don't hate me, but I lied to you. 
I'm still a virgin. 
I was just trying to fit in. 
Oh. Yeah, that makes more sense. 
Oh, my God. That's Joey. 
I should just tell him, right? 
No. If you're honest now, 
it might turn him off. 
What if he tries to have sex with me? 
Don't panic. Just make out with 
him like you normally would, and if he tries to go further, make up excuses. 
Ouch, I think I pulled my groin during Pilates. 
Ooh, I think I'm getting a cold sore. 
Exactly. High school 
boys are so stupid, they'll believe anything. 
And by the time you tell him the truth, he'll be so in love with you, he won't even care. 
Oh, my God, I love this plan. 
And this is the baby crowning. 
Wow. You never really think 
about it, but it's a baby. 
A whole baby that just grows in there from scrah, like a brownie. 
A brownie that costs $250, 000 to raise. 
And that's just in the first 18 years. 
If that brownie goes to college, which it better, you can tack on at least $100,000 more. 
My brownies will get sports scholarships. 
 You're missing the point. 
 Hi, Joey. 
Wow, you look amaze-balls. 
I'm sorry, what? 
Don't worry, Daddy, it's a compliment. 
Have her back by 10:00. 
Remember what I said about the brownies. 
Don't get near her oven. 
Hi, Patrick. 
Have fun on your date, or whatever. 
Hello, son. 
If I come in, do I have to watch the slide show again? 
Yes, but we'll go through it faster. 
Okay, I have a last minute surprise for you, Five-o. 
Oh, goodie. I love surprises. 
Should I close my eyes? 
Sure. Just put this 
blindfold on first. 
So where should we head for tonight's adventure? 
I don't care. 
I figured you'd have a plan. 
Well, I'm hungry. 
Let's go eat. Cool. 
How about Hal's Steak House? 
I'm dying for a rib eye. 
You know I don't eat anything with a face. 
They usually cut that part off before they serve it to you. You 
don't say. 
How about Vegan Nirvana? 
No, thanks. I'll just chew 
on a tree and save 20 bucks. 
You know what? I'll just drive. 
We'll find something. 
#  The boy meets the girl #  ># Somewhere in a crowd # This doesn't look like Benihana. 
Because it's my house. Voila. 
I set the table myself. 
I even cooked a dish I invented for myself. 
I call it chicken a la Joey. 
And it's only 300 calories per serving. 
Wow. Joey, this is so thoughtful. 
Well, I really wanted tonight to be special. 
Don't move. I'm going to 
get us the hors d'oeuvres. 
Oh, I almost forgot the best part My parents are out of town. 
We have the place all to ourselves. 
Want to go somewhere more comfortable? 
Uh, sure, but do you think I could have another piece of pie first? 
Sorry, babe, you finished it. 
Let's move to the couch. 
Um, okay. You're so tense. 
Really? I don't know why. 
I couldn't be looser. 
I don't mean that I'm loose. 
I just... I'll give you a massage. 
Look, 20/20. 
Man, I miss Ted Koppel. 
I'll record it. Just relax. 
Did you feel something? 
I think there was an earthquake. 
Nope, didn't feel a thing. 
Baby, what's wrong? 
Do you have any aspirin? 
I have a splitting virgin. 
Finally. I'm starving. 
We would have been eating an hour ago if you ate fish. 
Nothing with a face. 
 This place is expensive. 
 We're not going anywhere else. 
Hi, my name is Winston. I'm going 
to be your waiter. Can I take your 
order? 
Actually, we haven't finished Look, in 45 minutes, I got to kick you out of this table. 
We got some VIPs coming in. 
So more time with the menu, less time eating. 
I'll have the chicken. 
The passion fruit poisson or the fricassee? 
The first one. 
And for the lady? 
I'll just have the side salad. 
And please don't call me lady. 
 And for your entr?�e? 
 That is my entr?�e. 
Look, I'm just letting you know that the side salads are side salads. 
They're quite small. 
That's why they call them side salads. 
Get whatever you want. I got it. 
You sure? Don't worry about it. 
I'll have the ginger chipotle tofu, but without the chipotle. 
Okay, just so you know, that's not the way the award-winning chef designed it. 
And for your water, sparkling or still? 
Tap. Of course. 
Actually, I'd like sewer water, please. 
I'm going to get you for that. 
You know, Hacksaw Manor 1, there wasn't enough blood. 
Hacksaw Manor 2, way too much blood. 
Hacksaw Manor 3, too many babies died. 
Chastity Church? 
What are you doing here? 
Are you by yourself? 
Of course not. I am on a date. 
Okay, I can't really tolerate a man screaming during a movie. 
It is so unsexy. 
So I told him to sit in the back. 
Oh, that sounds exactly like you. 
I'm going to get some popcorn. 
Will you save my seat? 
Oh, could you get me a hot dog? 
Yeah, sure. 
And some licorice. 
Black. I hate the red. 
And maybe some nachos. 
But only if they have nachos supreme, but not if the nachos supreme have sour cream. 
Could I just-- Yeah. 
 Yeah.  Is that all? 
 And a diet soda. 
And hurry back. You don't 
want to miss the previews. 
Okay. 
Here you are, safe and sound. 
And two hours before curfew. 
Thanks for walking me to my door, Joey. 
Tonight was... 
Great. 
Dinner was amazing. 
I'll e-mail you the recipes. 
Up top, Five-o. Awesome night. 
Joey, wait. 
Are you sure you're okay with me being a virgin? 
Totally. No problemo. 
Everyone's a virgin at some point. 
It's nothing to be ashamed of. 
Then can I have a kiss good night? 
Sure. Good night. 
I know the drummer from Orchid Breeder. 
Shut up. How? 
This guy I know met him in rehab. 
This guy I kvow. Was it you? 
You got me. I'm a sex addict. 
Oh, my God. I thought I 
recognized you from group. 
You were the guy wearing the hoodie. 
You should have seen what I was wearing underneath. 
Nothing. 
If you hand me your card now, it'll save time. 
I'd like to review the check first. 
Thanks, Patrick. 
I'll totally get the next one. 
Cool. But this time... 
Run. Come on. 
I can't believe you did that. 
What were you thinking? 
We have to go back and pay that bill. 
Excuse you. 
This is not funny. That was wrong. 
What's wrong are those prices. 
Who pays that much? 
All the other people in the restaurant. 
Lighten up. That waiter was a jerk. 
What's the big deal? 
The big deal is that I don't want to commit a crime on our first date. 
Oh, I didn't realize this was a date. 
Neither did I, until you offered to pay. 
 Ah, but I didn't pay. 
 Ah, yes, I remember. 
Fine, this isn't a date. 
What's your problem? 
I thought you were cool with this. 
With what? 
With going on dates and not calling them dates? 
What's so terrible about a date?� 
Because a date comes with all these expectations on me, and I didn't sign up for Are you okay? 
Is something wrong? 
It's not fair. 
I know. They're just aristocrats 
whose carriage broke down in the wrong manor. 
No, you idiot. My life. 
My life isn't fair. 
I dumped Joey, and now he's on a date on a Friday night, and I'm here alone. 
I'm here, Chastity. 
Exactly. 
Oh, my life is such a mess. 
Why is this happening to me? 
I don't know. 
Can it happen somewhere else? 
We're trying to watch a movie. 
Hey, hey, give her a break. 
She's been through a lot. 
Please tell me what Joey did to you. 
Can you just leave me in peace with my ice cream and my Sex and the City marathon, please? 
Did he try to have sex in your city? 
I don't want to talk about it right now, Dad. 
Why didn't they make you with an off switch? 
Fine. Then I'm going 
to call and ask him. 
 I'll just get his folder. 
 Nothing happened, Dad. 
You really want to know what happened? 
At the end of our date, he gave me a high five. 
Are you happy? 
Ecstatic. 
 That was scary. 
 So scary. 
Who knew there were so many ways to kill people with one hand tool? 
Yeah. And if anyone 
finds out about tonight, I'll find one more. 
Hey, Dr. Stratford. 
I missed you, too. Is Bianca home? 
She's in her room. 
Just leave the door open-- And I know you will, because you're a good egg. 
Look, Joey, I didn't mean to overdo it with the slideshow. 
You may kiss her good night. 
 Chastely. 
 Is that with or without tongue? 
 Without. 
 Okay. 
 You okay? 
 I'm never eating tofu again. 
Promise? Hey, 
look on theright side... 
Our first date was memorable. 
But I'm not giving you a good night kiss. 
Your breath is seriously nasty. 
 Oh, my god. Is she drunk? 
 No, food poisoning. 
Okay. Come on inside. 
We'll get you some Gatorade. 
Maybe pump your stomach, huh? 
 Patrick, about the check... 
 Oh, my God. Are you kidding? 
 I'll take care of it somehow. 
 Do not pay for the tofu. 
Joey, what are you doing here? 
I came to apologize. 
I freaked out on you. 
No, I'm sorry. 
I should have been honest. 
It's just-- I was expecting our relationship to be an R-rated movie. 
Actually, I thought we might even be NC-17, since you slept with your teacher. 
And then I found out we were PG, and I uldn't remember when my last PG movie was. 
And then I was driving home, and I remembered. 
Transformers 2. 
That's the last PG movie I saw. 
And Megan Fox was so hot in it,  And she didn't even flash a boob. 
 Okay. 
What I'm saying is is that no matter what kind of movie we are, if we're going to be PG, then you're my Megan Fox. 
That is so sweet. 
And over time, we can eventually build up to being R-rated. 
Cool. That works for me. 
When you say eventually, do you mean weeks or months? 
English Version By iSubs.Coil.Us.To Team 
So, after waiting five hours for Joey's aunt... 
to get hooched up enough to pass out... 
we had full access to her infinity pool and hot tub. 
Of course, we forgot our swimsuits, but that didn't stop us. 
And that's how they invented tangelos. 
Uh, Chastity, I was out sick last week. 
Are "tangelos", like, a slang word for something? 
Sorry, ladies, but this story is NC-17. 
I can't serve it to minors. 
Just because I'm from Ohio doesn't mean I'm some naive little farm girl. 
My neighborhood was pretty sketch. 
You wouldn't believe the number of prostitutes we had hanging around our cul-de-sac. 
Oh, that is so cute! 
You brought a little kitty for naptime? 
 It's my lucky charm. 
 Oh. 
Okay, you got me. 
I use it to smuggle heroin. 
 Honey, something wrong? 
 I'm in the middle of a major crisis. 
Chastity thinks I'm a goody-goody, which means soon the whole school will. 
That is a major crises. 
It ranks right up there with the... 
global recession and the collapse of the arctic shelf. 
Let's turn on the radio, see if Bono wrote a song about you. 
Sarcasm never helps. 
You should be proud of yourself, Bianca. 
A good reputation can take you places in politics and business, in this house. 
Dad, we're in California now, home to medical marijuana... 
the Kardashians, the pantyless crotch flash. 
Good girls don't sit at the popular table. 
Maybe it wouldn't bother you so much if your self-esteem wasn't based on... 
 what other people think. 
 See, that's why you have no social life. 
I need to change my image. 
I've narrowed it down to getting a lip stud... 
dying my hair pink or... 
dressing like a pussycat doll. 
No face piercing, no alternative hair colors. 
 No pu What's a pussycat doll? 
 They're multihyphenates Strippers who sing. 
Why not tell people you're a groupie? 
Or one of those white house interns? 
Or some idiot... 
who gives birth to a baby at the prom, and they didn't even know they were pregnant? 
That is a genius idea, dad. 
Thanks! 
I can tell everyone I had a baby! 
Way to go, grandpa. 
Oh, she's gonna hate those pretend stretch marks. 
Funny. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: Did you watch dateline last night? 
I can't believe they haven't run out of predators. 
You missed. 
He's not gonna pick that up. 
Don't mess with him. 
He'll kill you, literally. 
 That's what he wants you to think. 
 Kat, he comes from a long line of criminals. 
I heard his dad's in prison for skinning a man alive. 
Okay, well, his gene pool gives him an excuse to kill... not litter. 
Be careful. 
His mom's a Mexican drug lord. 
Pick it up. 
Ohh. 
Do you have trouble hearing? 
Real mature. 
I just like watching you bend over. 
Oh, that's nothing. 
You should watch me do this. 
Now you know how the earth feels. 
It's called peacocking, bro. 
All the celebrity dudes are doing it. 
Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake... 
even that Mormon guy on the real world. 
I don't know. It feels weird 
drawing attention to my neck. 
You're never gonna get Bianca in your Bill Gates wardrobe... 
without the mad scrilla to back it up. 
Okay. But are you sure 
it doesn't make me look like a... 
choreographer? 
Oh, you look great. 
I have a big fat favor to ask. 
Ooh. I don't respond to "fat". 
Mmm. 
Okay, a small skinny favor then. 
Can I lie and say I'm at your house after school? 
 If it's for a good reason. 
 Well, I'm dating this older guy... 
and my dad would freak if he found out. 
How much older is "older"? 
26. Or maybe 31. 
It's hard to tell. 
He feels weird about the age difference. It's adorable. 
Wow. 
The oldest guy I've ever been with was my camp counselor. 
I know what you're gonna say. 
"Bianca, this can't go anywhere." 
And you're right. 
But he's so hot, and when he blows on my neck, I... 
I... I've already said too much. 
Promise you won't tell? 
Oh, come on, Bianca. 
You can totally trust me. 
 Hey, Bianca. 
 Hey, Cameron, gotta run. 
Nice scarf. 
Talk later. 
This peacock needs more feathers. 
Tell me what happened. 
He littered. 
Which apparently triggered some sort of psychotic break. 
Right- right. Because I'm a woman. 
I'm emotionally unstable. 
Way to stereotype. 
Mr. Verona, since you 
love trash so much... 
you can spend the afternoon in detention picking it up. 
 But she's the one who  Don't try and pin it on her. 
Whatever happened is obviously your fault. It always is. 
 You're kidding me, right? 
 I don't kid... 
between the hours of 8:00 and 3:00. 
Bu-bye. 
Oh. hey, 
he forgot his backpack. 
You can go. 
Unless you want to help me hire a new lunch lady. 
Why they wear their hairnets to these interviews I'll never understand. 
Don't you think that that was a little harsh? 
You don't even know what happened. 
What about innocent until proven guilty? 
Are you representing him now, Mr. Dershowitz? 
Patrick Verona has spent more time in this office than I have. 
For what? 
Here. 
Let me get his file for you. 
Oh, wait a minute. It says here 
it's none of your business. 
Okay, here's the thing. 
He did litter, repeatedly, and I think he enjoyed it... 
but I may have overreacted a little when I... 
kicked the trash can over on him. 
 It's very noble of you to confess. 
 Thank you. 
 So he doesn't have detention? 
 No. You have it with him. 
But I suggest you keep your distance. 
Have you ever poked a monkey in a cage? 
You poke him enough times, he'll bite you back. 
Yeah. 
He'll bite back. 
Bianca... 
if I were to buy a book about a girl named Bianca and an older guy... 
where would I find it? 
Fiction or nonfiction? 
Oh, definitely nonfiction. 
So it's not true. 
Oh, no, it's true. 
Oh, cool. Dating older dudes 
is a textbook supermodel maneuver. 
Give me some. 
Pishhh! 
 Mr. Ross? Hi. 
 Hi. 
Who invented geometry? 
Um, I-- I say it was Pythagoras, but, uh, Belinda says Euclid. 
Uh, well, Euclid was known as the father of geometry... 
though, technically, he didn't invent it. 
He just wrote it all down. 
 I knew you'd know. 
 You know everything. 
Uh, well, not everything. 
But most things, yeah. 
Okay. Uh, Bianca, you mind sticking 
around, going over your test? 
Oh, was it my ink choice? 
I like working in fuchsia. 
It relaxes me. 
You skipped an entire page of the test. 
I'm assuming you don't hate isosceles triangles? 
"Hate" is a strong word. 
I'd prefer to call our relationship rocky. 
I can't believe it. She is totally 
having an affair with Mr. Ross! 
 I'm so jealous. 
 I hate her. 
I can't believe she's making me return Patrick's bag. 
 Let him get his own Sherpa. 
 It's not ticking. 
Good, 'cause my bomb-defusing skills are a little rusty. 
Oh, I'm so tempted to just toss this in the dumpster. 
 First let's look through it. 
 That's an invasion of privacy. 
How would you like somebody to look through your stuff? 
 I don't care. You wanna look in my bag? 
 Not really. 
 Oh, no. It's coming undone. 
 Come on. Don't. This is not cool. 
Kat, it would be irresponsible not to open it. 
What if there's a murder weapon in here? 
What's in there? 
It's just as I thought. 
Before he kills, he uses a lighter to burn off his fingerprints... 
then he uses those gloves to strangle people... 
and the clippers to cut off souvenir body parts. 
Ah. What's the antacid for, Sherlock? 
Maybe what he does is so horrifically vicious even he gets nauseous. 
Trust me, Patrick Verona wishes he was that dangerous. 
Reality is never as juicy the rumor. 
No way! Mr. Ross is not having 
an affair. That's crazy. 
Who told you this? 
Hi, everybody. 
 What's going on? 
 Um, you're welcome. 
 Thank you so much for... 
 Totally covering for you and Mr. Ross... 
which means you owe me the juicy details. 
Wait. You think Mr. Ross 
is my older guy? 
It's not him. 
Why would you think that? 
I know what I saw. 
I have to say... 
you holding out on me hurts my heart a little, Bianca. 
I thought that we were slowly building that bridge of friendship brick by brick. 
 But now I worry that it may be crumbling. 
 No. No, no, no, no, no. 
The bridge is still very much intact. 
Remember, bricks are strong and sturdy. 
They're the only thing you can't huff and puff down. 
Well, secrets can cause erosion. 
Okay, you got me. 
It is Mr. Ross. 
But now you really, really can't tell anyone. 
I wouldn't want him to get into trouble. 
Oh, I would never. 
Now dish. 
Can't stay away, can you? 
Did you take a peek? 
Ooh, I was going to, but my hazmat suit is at the cleaners. 
Okay, fine. 
It's not Mr. Ross. 
But if it were Mr. Ross, 
how did it start? 
It's not Mr. Ross. 
Well... 
I was at that store in the mall-- The one with the creepy mannequins with no hands And I was trying on these pink skinny-legged jeans... 
and I came out of the dressing room, and Mr. Jones was there. 
And he was all, "wow". 
Wow! 
Bianca hasn't even looked over here yet. 
And I know it's working, because everyone else is staring. 
Are you sure girls like seeing a guy's nipple imprints? 
I think your nipples are too young and baby smooth to attract Bianca. 
So, what are we talking? Piercing? 
'Cause I don't know if my mom will let me. 
Look, I'm not talking about your style, bro. 
I'm talking about your girl. 
She's not who you think she is. 
Bianca's hooking up with Mr. Ross. 
 What? No way. 
She would never do that. 
I know Bianca. 
She's a sweet, decent person, like, uh, Taylor Swift. 
Bianca Stratford, please report to the principal's office. 
Ooohhh! 
I think I finally figured you out. 
You dump trash on me, you go out of your way to get detention... 
steal my backpack. 
You're obsessed with me. 
Mmm. 
What can I say? 
You nailed it. 
You and me in these sexy vests picking up trash... 
the sweet stench of garbage in the air. 
Welcome to my dream date. 
 Am I making you nervous? 
 So nervous. 
Ooh. How much 
would you pay me to eat this? 
 You want a bite? 
 Gross! 
Aahh! 
No wonder you have acid reflux. 
You did look in my bag. 
What? 
Come on. Just cop to it. 
You couldn't resist. 
Seriously, it's okay if you're obsessed with me. Just admit it. 
No. 
I did not look in your bag. 
Ow! 
Thank you. 
Sorry, Bianca. 
I'm just trying to protect you from yourself. 
I mean, it's not like you were born a slut. 
Bianca, this is Darlene Tharp, the school shrink... 
we have to have here by law. 
She's gonna ask you a few questions. 
Okay. 
Hey. 
 Is this okay? 
 Mmhmm. 
Okay. Just know 
that I am here to listen... 
with open ears, open heart and open mind. 
It is just the two of us against the world. Okay? 
Bianca... 
please tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Ross. 
It's just your normal, run-of-the-mill student/teacher variety. 
Bianca, sweetie, this is a safe place, okay? 
Think of me as your cool aunt or your B.F.F. 
Or all those ladies from the view rolled into one. 
 Oh, Lord. 
 Okay, Bianca... 
can you show me, on the doll, where Mr. Ross touched you? 
Bianca, are you having an affair with Liam, or not? 
 Liam? Who's Liam? 
 Liam Ross. 
No, absolutely not! 
I've never had an affair with anybody. 
Listen, I'm very aware that Mr. Ross is an attractive 
Extremely attractive, funny, sexy man... 
with really nice hands. 
But you don't have to protect him. 
Because he is the enemy. 
You can destroy him. 
Would you like to hurt Mr. Ross? 
Come on. Go ahead. 
You can rip his head off. 
Miss Tharp, I swear, nothing happened. 
It was just a story. 
I made it up. 
Listen, I know you don't want to betray your lover. 
That's understandable. 
But if this is true, he needs to go to jail... 
no matter how good-looking he is. 
This is going to sound really stupid... 
but I was just pretending to be a bad girl. 
I'm actually a goody-goody. 
I don't own a thong, I floss every day... 
and sometimes when I cross the street, I still like to hold my daddy's hand. 
And I have a lucky cat. 
Poor Mr. Doodles. 
All right. Thank you, Bianca. 
We'll take it from here. 
Stop. 
That's how we got into this mess. Just... 
 Let me see it. 
 It's fine. I just lost half a toenail. 
Let me see. 
You can go. 
No. No, no, no. 
I'm not gonna go. 
Because you're obsessed with me. 
His time of the month. 
Mr. Verona. 
 Where is it? 
 What? 
I can't believe you would take it. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
I didn't take anything. 
Oh, sure you didn't. Just like 
you didn't look through my bag! 
Patrick! 
Cameron, I need your help. 
I'm in so much trouble. 
Yeah, I know all about that. 
You and Mr. Ross. 
I didn't think you were capable of something so unsavory. 
Cameron, you know me. What's the one thing 
I want more than anything else in the world? 
Beyonce to perform at your sweet 16. 
In the real world. 
Oh. 
To be popular. 
So this morning, I made up this rumor about me dating an older guy... 
and then that older guy turned into Mr. Ross. 
And now, because of a stupid lie, a really hot teacher's life could be ruined. 
It's the most horrible thing I've ever done. 
 This is great news. 
 Why is it great, exactly? 
Because this will be a valuable life lesson... 
that will help calibrate your moral compass. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
But, Cameron, what should I do? 
You've gotta warn Mr. Ross. 
Oh, my God! 
Mr. Ross! 
Mr. Ross, it's all my fault. 
I'm so sorry. 
Is this about the test? 
Because I gave you an A-minus. 
You guys have to let him go. 
He's an innocent man. I can prove it. 
Liam! 
You cheated on me with her? 
No! No! 
Rot in jail, scumbag! 
It isn't true, Sophia! 
You're the only one I ever loved! 
Sophia! Sophia! 
Mr. Ross, you... 
two-timing jerk face! 
So something fell out of his bag. 
Any clue what it might be? 
Breath spray? A yo-yo? 
 Maybe a finger? 
 I don't know. 
It was hard to understand anything he said after he Christian baled on me. 
But if I don't find whatever the hell it is, he's gonna think I kept it on purpose. 
Then he busts out the gloves and strangles you. 
Oh. 
People in this school are sick! 
I'm going in. 
Think this it? 
Hey-hey, come- come on. 
Give a girl some air. 
I mean, can't you see that she is in a lot of pain? 
So what was the hottest thing that you and Mr. R ever did? 
'Cause Joey-- he's really into role-playing. 
Well, this one time, he asked me to stay after class and I did... 
and he pulled up this chair-desk and... 
Cameron! 
Uh, sorry. I really need 
to talk to him. 
To be continued. 
 God, that was so intense. 
 I know. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
Thanks for being there for me. 
I don't know what I'd do without you. 
I'm so lucky to have met you. 
You're my first G.B.F. 
 What a G.B.F.? 
 "Gay Best Friend." 
See you tomorrow. 
She was just kidding. 
She was just kidding. 
It's nothing. 
Kat, can we get out of here? 
I just wanna go home... 
and watch crazy people on reality TV so I can feel normal again. 
Let's go! 
"No, I won't eat my peas "And I won't skin my knees "And I won't lose my keys." 
Again! 
Dad, you want to hear my oral report on Sacagawea? 
 In a minute, Kat. 
Your sister's singing. 
Fine, I'll go eat some candy. 
Again. 
Oh, I'm so cute. 
Dakota Fanning, eat your heart out. 
There. There's the moment 
I knew you had a gift. 
Ooh, look, home movies. 
Let me guess It's talent show season? 
Yes, and I'm on pins and needles. 
What are you going to sing this year? 
I don't know. Pop music 
is in a state of flux. 
Am I a Taylor, a Miley, a Leona? 
How about a Lady Gag-Me? 
It's Gaga. 
Really? 
I know I'm biased, but I don't know how you're going to top last year. 
Thanks, Daddy. 
Yeah, I actually believed you kissed a girl and liked it. 
That's why your sister got two standing ovations. 
Yeah, but all I won was a stupid trophy. 
This year, the winner gets a walk-on role on Make It or Break It. 
How can you not love California? 
Make It or Break It? 
What's that? 
It's television's number one drama, set in the world of competitive gymnastics. 
I'll set my TiVo. 
So Dad, I need some help on something important. 
Will you proofread this letter to the editor of the paper? 
That depends. Do you promise to 
agree to disagree about semicolons? 
I promise. 
But first, will you sign my permission slip for the talent show? 
With pleasure. 
 And  Really? You're dancing? 
I never knew you could dance. 
Yup. Check this out. 
Hey! 
Cool, huh? 
It's called the kalinka. 
And why exactly are you doing that? 
To make my bubonia proud. 
That's what we call my grandmother. 
She's Russian. 
But don't worry, she's a cool Russian, not one of the scary ones. 
That guy's a weirdo. 
Of course he is. 
He's dating my sister, whose impressive karaoke skills will probably score her three seconds of face time on TV's number one gymnastics drama, making her even more impossible to be around. 
Someone's jealous. 
Me, jealous of Bianca? 
That's stupid. You're stupid. 
Hey, Kat, can I borrow your pen? 
Oh-ho, what do you think? 
I'm practicing for the talent show. 
Thus, my practice cape. 
Didn't even know he did magic. 
Impressive. 
Oh, it runs in my blood. 
My gay uncle had a show off-Strip in Vegas called Abracafabulous. 
He's teaching me all his secrets while he's sleeping on our couch. 
Wait till you see my guillotine trick. 
You will lose your heads. 
You get it? 
'Cause of the guillotine. 
Okay. Bye, scary people. 
Poor kid. 
It's like middle school all over again. 
Ooh, what happened? 
I love origin stories. 
He was singing My Girl" on stage at this stupid concert choir thing when, uh-- Let's just say he became aroused. 
Oh, poor guy. 
Is that why people call him Spoink. 
Yup. I came up with it. 
Dad, check out the paper. 
They printed your letter? 
Not only did they print it, they changed their policy and are now publishing same-sex wedding announcements. 
Anyone we know? 
Can you stand there and hold up the paper? 
Dad, don't tape this. 
I'm just checking out the zoom on this new camera. It's amazing. 
We'll practically be on stage with Bianca. 
So I have a little announcement to make. 
I have picked my song for the talent show. 
Pause for dramatic effect. 
"Kids in America." 
That's perfect. You're a kid, 
and who doesn't love the word America? 
This is so exciting. 
What are you going to wear? 
I was thinking of going for a retro Pat Benatarish vibe Oh, you're mocking me. 
Just for that, don't expect to be thanked in my acceptance speech. 
How are you so sure you're going to win? 
It's called the power of positive thinking. 
Plus, I always win. 
Bianca, watch it. 
It's just a newspaper. 
I'll pick up more copies at work. 
Bianca, let's hear some scales. 
Again! 
Cameron, please tell me your magic act is going to be amazing. 
Abracafabulous is no more. 
Michael quit as my assistant. 
It seems he doesn't trust these steady hands to work a trick guillotine. 
But your uncle entrusted you with the secrets of his gay magic. 
It's not gay magic. 
There's just a lot of rhinestones. 
Help me convince Cameron not to quit the talent show. 
Don't quit. 
Everybody loves a dark horse, and you're as dark as they get. 
You could win. 
Well, I don't know what to tell you. 
I can't cut off my own head. 
Fine, I'll be your assistant. 
What's so funny? 
Uh, I'm sorry. 
It's no offense. 
It's just-- You don't seem like an assistant. 
You seem more like a boss. 
I'm just trying to help you out. 
Sure you are. 
He deserves to win. 
I want people to stop calling him Spoink. 
They still call me that? 
It wasn't my fault. 
It was the unfortunate convergence of puberty and corduroy pants. 
This is your chance to live that down. 
No pun intended. 
Shut up. 
Let's do a kick-ass magic show. 
Okay. Alakazam. 
Let's start with the basics. 
What do you know about trap doors? 
Talk to me. 
Uh, nothing. 
You still taking bets on the talent show? 
Uh, Chastity's the favorite, but people are saying that new blond chick might make this interesting. 
I'll put 50 down on Cameron James. 
Spoink? 
It's your funeral, Verona. 
Honey, do you have to wear that hat everywhere we go? 
Yeah, 'cause I'm rehearsing in my head. 
I can't wait to get on that stage. 
This is going to be my chance to show Chastity I'm not just her little sidekick. 
In fact, after I win the talent show, maybe I'll get my own sidekick. 
Cool. Circle of life. 
"Everybody live for the music" Oh, my God. 
Do you hear that? 
Yeah. Chastity sounds 
like a robot, but at least she's on-key for once. 
Because she's using an auto tuner to sing my song. 
Okay, boys, keep working on that. 
And butch it up. 
This isn't Pippin. 
Hey. Impressive, right? 
We still have to work out the confetti cannons. 
Chastity, that's my song. 
Oh, really? Did you write it? 
No, but I wrote it on the sign-up sheet, and I signed up before you did, which means I called it first. 
You can still sing it. 
You're scheduled to go on after me, so it'll make a nice reprise. 
Or if you need a new routine, just slap on a babushka and toss some plates on the floor with Joey. 
Nice, Chastity. 
That shows how much you know. 
Russians don't throw plates on the floor. 
We wear tall black boots and go hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. 
Okay, now that's talent right there. Yeah. 
He's not the one singing through a computer, R2D-Tune. 
Oh, I can sing, okay? 
It's just the sound of contemporary pop music. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a showstopper to perfect. 
" And five, six, seven, eight. 
"We're the kids of America "Oh "We're the kids of America" Sometimes, I miss Ohio. 
Surprised to see you here. 
I would have thought you'd have graduated by now. 
I'm just here to support your daughter. 
Doesn't Bianca have her own boyfriend to support her? 
Not that I like that. 
No, I'm here for Kat. 
You didn't know? 
She's in the show. 
She would never. 
She would. 
In a sexy dress, no less. 
Oh, does that thing have zoom? 
I get it. 
You're punking me again. 
Kat Stratford. 
See? I can read. 
Why would Kat enter a talent show? 
Do they want to adopt a whale or something? 
My theory? She's jealous. 
She's jealous? Of whom? 
Oh, dear. 
This is going to be good. 
Welcome to the Padua High talent show. 
Before we begin, a reminder If your phone rings, it will be confiscated, and I need a new one, so go ahead, make my day. 
Next year, I'm writing my own material. 
Please welcome Allen Griswold on the accordion. 
You're up next. 
Where's your sidekick? 
Don't leave until I get a photo of you in that get-up. 
I can't do this. 
Let's go home. I'll make 
slice and bake cookies. 
No, we're not going anywhere. 
You're the one who wanted to do this. 
I wanted to impress people with Abracafabulous, but every time I think of the word wand"... 
Cameron, our show is great. 
This is your moment. 
If you get nervous, just picture the entire audience in their... 
Winter ski gear. 
Crack, you stupid whip. 
How does Britney Spears do this while singing? 
Just do your best. 
I can't believe my bubonia is going to see you in that outfit. 
Oh, hey, Cameron. 
You look abracafabulous. 
Thanks, Bianca. 
You look... 
Like you're ready to hit the slopes. 
Kat, what are you doing here, and why are you dressed like Miss Scarlet from Clue? 
I'm in the show with Cameron. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go double-check the guillotine. 
Break a leg. 
 Ouch! 
All rightie. 
Thank you for getting Thank you for getting the show off to such a rousing start. 
And now, for our second act of the evening, Cameron James, master of magic. 
Ladies and gentlemen  Spoink! 
Prepare to be amazed. 
Straight from the back streets of Vegas, I bring you Abracafabulous. 
But no great magician would be complete without his beautiful assistant. 
Please welcome Katerina. 
Katerina, you may come out of the magic box. 
Katerina... 
Get out of the magic box. 
Ruh-roh. 
Please tell me this is part of the act. 
Perhaps she will easily come out with the use of my magic cane. 
This is not good. 
Chastity, there's a problem with your auto-tuner. 
What kind of problem? 
It's broken. 
Broken? It can't be broken. 
Let me take a look at it. 
You probably just can't figure out how to turn it on. 
If there's anything I know, it's how to turn things on. 
I hate working with you amateurs. 
Excuse me, tech guy, is it too late to go back to my old song? 
Katerina, please lower thyself into this mysterious chest. 
The show must go on. 
This chest always has been a problem for me. 
It seems to have quite the appetite. 
Thank you. 
Not to worry. 
My lady Katerina is only trapped between realms. 
Katerina? 
Quit messing around. 
Mom, don't worry about it. 
I can still sing the song. 
No, you can't. 
That's why I spent $700 on an auto-tuner. 
But you said it was the sound of contemporary pop music. 
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it. 
I was being a good mother. 
What are we going to do? 
My friends are out there. 
I told them you were going to win. 
I might still win. 
Sweetie, mothers don't let daughters embarrass themselves. 
Just fake some sort of illness and meet me at the car. 
Listen, Chastity, as long as you're insisting on stealing my song, maybe we should just sing it together. 
Otherwise, we'll just cancel each other out, and neither of us will win. 
You mean like a duet? 
Why not? 
It's not called "Kid in America." 
" "Looking out a dirty old window "Down below, the cars in the city go "Rushing by "I sit here alone and I wonder why "Friday night, and everyone's moving "I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down "I search for the beat in this dirty town "Downtown the young ones are going "Downtown the young ones are growing "We're the kids in America "Whoa, oh, oh "We're the kids in America "Everybody live for the music around "Outside, a new day is dawning" That's my daughter. 
The blonde one. 
"Outside suburbia's crawling everywhere "I don't want to go, baby "New York to east California "There's a new wave coming I warn you "We're the kids in America "Whoa, oh, oh "We're the kids in America "Everybody live for the music around "We're the kids in America "We're the kids in America "Whoa, oh, oh "Everybody live for the music around..." 
Oh, my God, you were awesome. 
I know. My mom can eat it. 
You totally inspired me to greatness, bestie. 
If we win that walk-on role, I'm going to let you walk on first. 
Excuse you. 
I'm not going back out there. 
Oh yes, you are. 
I've got 50 bucks riding on you that I don't have. 
You shouldn't have bet on me. 
Don't you know it's illegal? 
Do it for yourself, Spoink. 
Hey! 
Look, all those kids out there already think you're a loser. 
You want to prove them right? 
Did you just give me a pep talk? 
Hello again, folks. 
I just came out to get my pen. 
"I've got sunshine "On a cloudy day "When it's cold outside "I've got the month of May "Well, I guess you'll say "What can make me feel this way? 
"My girl " "Talking 'bout my girl "My girl "I've got so much honey "The bees envy me "I got a sweeter song, baby." 
"Than the birds in the trees" I'm glad I found you here. I was worried you 
were trapped in an alternate dimension. 
Here. 
This will help with the nausea, but it won't help with the shame. 
How do you get up on stage like that? 
You make it look so easy. 
I don't practice just to annoy you. 
I work my ass off. 
Plus, it helps, being pretty and talented. 
Well, I suck. I was worse 
than the one-man band. 
Yeah, you were. 
Luckily, you're good at other things, like getting A"s and recycling, and making people feel so bad that they do something good. 
Yeah, but when I do those things, people don't applaud, and Dad has never worn a stupid t-shirt with my name on it. 
Oh, my God. 
You just admitted you're jealous of me. 
Can I capture this moment on my phone? 
I want Youtube-uploadable proof. 
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I sometimes wish I had your hair. 
Again. 
 "Well "I guess you'll say "What can make me feel this way? 
"My girl "Talking 'bout my girl "My girl All right, we get it. 
Everyone loves an underdog. 
Now, as the judges make their final decisions, will all the contestants join me on stage? 
Everyone. 
And the winner of the Padua High talent show is... 
Wow. She's good. 
I know. I hate her already. 
Towel? 
Meat Is Not Green, huh? 
If it is, you probably shouldn't eat it. 
Don't mock. 
This book is fascinating. 
Did you know that 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from animal agriculture? 
That is fascinating. 
If everyone at this school ate vegetables instead of processed animal flesh just one day a week, it would make a huge environmental impact. 
Huh. What else can I do? 
Is there, like, a walk-a-thon or something? 
No. If you don't want 
to do it for the earth,  do it for your colon. 
 Come on, I'm eating. 
I can see that. 
Vividly. 
    Okay. Recess is over. 
Enjoy your carbon footprint. 
I'm going to go do something about this. 
Of course you are. 
 Still want to hang out after school? 
 Sure. 
Hey, Cameron, this seat has your name on it. 
Well, actually, it says "Dee's nuts," but you can still sit here. 
No thanks. 
My friends are waiting for me. 
Hey, guys. 
Thanks for saving me a seat. 
Anyone want my Fruit Roll-Up? 
I can't believe he's still hung up on you. 
It's been three whole weeks. 
I wish he'd get over me so we could go back to being friends. 
Those Goth kids are going to eat him alive. 
Ooh, don't look now. 
It's Max Morita. 
I'm so in love with him. 
I thought you were in love with David Allen. 
That was before he flirted with Kelly Morris in front of my face. 
That's so rude. 
Eh, I'm over it. I've upgraded to 
Max, and I couldn't be happier. 
Oh, my God. Dawn, that's it. 
What's it? 
If we find Cameron someone else, he'll be so happy we can go back to being friends. 
Bianca, are you saying what I think you're saying? 
 Matchmaking! 
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU Season 1 Episode 14 MEAT IS MURDER Transcript by Addic7ed.com 
and iSubs.coil.us.to Teams! 
What about Barbara? 
She bites her nails and eats them. 
Ugh. 
Gina? 
She just had a baby. 
Oh, I thought she just lost a bunch of weight. 
What about her? Stacy. 
According to her stats, she's freakishly tall, just like Cameron. 
But I don't know if she's his type. 
It says here she likes cats, hiking in the foothills, and Celine Dion. 
Cameron hates cats and hiking. 
 Ooh, it's my future husband. 
Hi, Max. 
 Bianca. 
So what's up? 
No! 
Really? 
Uh-oh, you have "old person trying to use the computer" face. 
I can't figure out how to uplink a photo. 
Upload. 
What's it for? 
CyberSerenade? 
A friend at the hospital convinced me to sign up for this online dating site. 
Oh, Dad, that's so great. 
I don't know. 
I haven't dated since... 
Since Mom died. 
Yes, but also since I looked like this. 
Hair? 
Oh, my God. 
My friend says you should assume everybody's 10 years older and 50 pounds heavier than their picture. 
I figure when women meet me, they'll think, Well, he's bald, but at least he can see his feet. 
It says here you're interested in Nora Ephron movies, antiquing, and tending to your herb garden. 
We don't have an herb garden. 
But we could. Think about it. 
Fresh herbs, mm. 
Dad, these are all lies. 
My friend says to think of them more as sales tools. 
You're right. 
He's an idiot. 
No. 
He is a genius. 
Well, he is a brain surgeon. 
Dawn, I have a great idea. 
School spirit has seriously been sagging since we lost the girls' golf finals. 
As spirit chair, it's my job to lift people's spirits, which is why we need more funds for balloons. 
Danica, this is a travesty. 
If the balloon budget has been blown, then we cannot afford to just stick a pin in this. 
Out of order. You must be recognized 
by the president in order to speak. 
Our president's asleep in his chair. 
A vivid example of why so few surfers become great legislators. 
I've got orchestra practice in 15 minutes, and I have to soak my reed. 
Can we adjourn? 
Motion to adjourn can only be made by the president. 
Is there any more business? 
I have something? 
Point of order, you must be recognized by the... 
The president recognizes the patient young lady with the long brown hair. 
Please continue. 
I'm here to ask for your help. 
Every day, the earth is getting closer and closer to cataclysmic climate change, yet every year, we're burning more and more fossil fuels. 
It's time for our generation to say enough. 
We didn't cause this mess, but we can clean it up, and that starts right here, right now, with your approval of "Meatless Mondays". 
But Mondays are pepperoni pizza day. 
Allow me to share this short but educational slide show on the urgent... 
I don't have time for a slide show. 
Can we table this? 
Unlike Balloongate, this actually is a serious issue. 
If we stick a pin in it, we're all going to die. 
I doubt that'll happen by our next meeting, but I'll put you on the agenda. 
Adjourned. 
Welcome to hell. 
You're lucky. 
You're just visiting. 
Cameron James? 
He's one of the eight boys at school who's taller than me. 
Plus he's got great eyes. 
But trust me, he's not interested. 
Yet. 
That's where we come in. 
We are going to give you... 
A makeover! 
A makeover! 
Oh, my God. 
I've always dreamed of getting makeovers from cheerleaders. 
Wait, you're not going to pour pig's blood on me, are you? 
No, we just want to help you reach your full potential. 
This is so great. 
I can't wait to see my new hair. 
And when do I get to try on all my different outfits? 
Will I get to twirl around while the sales girls applaud? 
We only have until next period, so we don't have time for the full makeover montage. 
But relax. 
Dawn is a styling genius. 
And I'll give you a crash course on all of Cameron's favorite things. 
Oh, my God, this is going to be fun. 
This is Kate. She blew up the 
trailer her stepfather was in, but you learn later that she was completely justified. 
You love your old Legos and refuse to give them away, no matter what your mom says. 
You're counting down the days until Toy Story 3 comes out on June 18th, and he's going to college. 
? I don't know what 
to do about her ? 
? She's one of those 
kind of girls ? 
? So tell me what 
to do with her ? 
Wow. 
You look stunning. 
Can I see? 
Not till the big reveal. 
Now we just have to find the perfect place for them to meet. 
Somewhere where she's back-lit. 
Oh, yeah. 
We did not get a chance to officially meet. 
Kat Stratford. 
William Blankenship. 
Everyone calls me Blank. 
I wanted to thank you for trying to intervene on my behalf. 
Oh, I'm sorry I gave that impression. 
Frankly, I couldn't care less about your little crusade. 
I just had a spontaneous outburst because you're the first American I've met who's actually aware there's an entire world beyond the boundaries of your jingoistic, gluttonous, puffed-up former superpower. 
Okay. 
I think there's some common ground in there. 
Different words, maybe. 
I also noticed your hair. 
I like brown hair. 
It gives a woman an air of intelligence. 
Much like your English accent gives you an air of snobbish entitlement. 
Oh, dear God. 
It's not just an air. 
You actually are intelligent. 
And I want meatless Mondays passed. 
Never going to happen. 
This year's most sweeping piece of legislation was the bold switch to two-ply toilet tissue. 
I agree. This school is filled 
with apathetic mouth-breathers. 
But this is a chance to actually change things for the better. 
Isn't that what politics is all about? 
Aw, that's adorable. 
Politics is about power. 
Wait. 
And this would show people that the student council has it. 
See? 
Your ego wants to help me. 
All right, I'm in. 
Let's shake things up. 
Give me your number. 
We can strategize. 
That was easy. 
I'll call you. 
Who's that guy? 
 His name is Blank.  Blank? 
Sounds like a douche. 
Please don't use that word. 
It's loaded with gender bias. 
I know. 
That's why I like it. 
Hey, Cameron. I'm sorry, I'm 
late for an awards ceremony. 
Wait. I know you don't 
want to talk to me, but... 
Yeah, I know, and that's easier to do when you don't talk to me, so please don't. 
Look, I'm just trying to do a favor for my friend Stacy. 
She has a huge crush on you. 
Really? Your friend? 
Stacy who? 
Stacy. The cute, tall girl. 
That's her right over there. 
 Wow. 
That's not how she looked first period. 
 Girls are like flowers. 
You'll never know when they'll bloom. 
Listen, she's too shy to talk to you, so if you're interested, you better make a move before some other guy snatches her up. 
Oh, gosh. A move? 
Which one will I pick? 
Just talk about Lost. 
She's a huge fan. 
Lost? 
So am I! 
My theory about the smoke monster will blow her mind. 
It's the spirit of the island. 
 Great. I don't know why, 
but I just have this feeling you two are going to really hit it off. 
Thanks, B. 
Hey. 
 Hi. So I hear you know 
something about a plane crash. 
So... 
You need to go after the 3 swing votes voting is all about exploiting the weakness, desire or vanity of your target. 
First up: Tabitha 'out of order' Cook She's more desperate for respect than a washed up boy band. 
Tabitha, you are the face of student council. 
I mean, you make the announcements every morning It's harder than it looks. 
We don't even have a teleprompter. 
That's why I need you to be the face of "Meatless Mondays". 
If this thing works, it could go National. 
You could be interviewed on Fox News? 
Just picture it "Tabitha Cook, the voice of America's future". 
"This is Tabitha Cook". 
Then is our illustrious President Trey. 
This is how he looks awake. 
To see him like this, you need to get him before second period. 
Trey, got an idea. 
Sign this absentee ballot and you won't have to come to today's meeting. 
And I hear the surf's 10 feet and off shore and cresting. 
Dude, that's awesome. 
I mean, it's too many damn meetings. 
I only ran because my friend Luke goes "Dude if you run for President, I'll lick your dogs butt.": 
I go: "Dude, it's on" And let us not forget Our school spirit fundamentalist. 
Meat is so much more expensive than even locally grown vegetables, that the savings would be enough for us to buy our very own helium tank. 
So then, I tell her about the helium tanks, and she says... 
"Thank God, my cheeks are killing me." 
Sounds like my Roast Beef sandwich days are numbered. 
You can kiss your meat goodbye. 
I still got Tuesday through Thursday. 
Oh, so we're not having "Meatless Friday's" too huh? 
So I printed this up, it's a new theory on the real reason why Oceanic flight 815 crashed. 
My God, time traveling fantasy TV is so confusing. 
Oh, hey Cameron, we were just talking about you. Sit, Sit. 
Hello Ladies. 
Gotta a little gift for you. 
Oh Yeah It's your favorite! 
Brigadier General, Billy Mitchel. 
Right! From that... 
war. 
World War I, Stacy. 
She's a little nervous. 
Thank you so much, Cameron. 
I'll put them by my bed. 
Well, no it should really be in a climate controlled environment. 
You'll keep him in your special refrigeration case Stace. 
 Oh Ok  Perfect. 
Ok, I got a little surprise. 
My mom, made and extra peanut and bacon sandwich for you. 
She cut the crust off and put it on olive bread just like we like it. 
That... 
looks really good. 
Oh, it's so good, right? 
I bet it tastes better than one of those expired Dharma candy bars Hurley found in the Hatch huh? 
Yeah, like from "Lost", right? 
Uh, I can't. 
I can't. 
Bianca, I really appreciate the make over but... 
remember everything you told me to say and I hate bacon and Kevin deserves a girl who will treasure this Billy D. 
Williams action figure. 
I'm sorry. 
She just called this an Action Figure. 
What is going on? 
Did you put her up to this? 
I just wanted you to be happy.. 
Well, mission accomplished! 
I'm s...so happy. 
Cameron, she really was interested in you. 
Come on, come on. 
Please go my way. 
Hey. 
Want to get out of here? 
No now. 
Student Council is voting on "Meatless Mondays" Again? 
No it was tabled remembered? 
What? 
It was defeated? x 
It passed by 3 votes. 
"Your Mondays will evermore be 'Meat free" We did it! 
Thank you so much! 
I only did it so you'd stop hounding me. 
I should head back inside. 
Before Tabitha has be drawn and quartered. 
Oh, yes! 
Can you believe this? 
Nice, we go now? 
That's it? I finally change something 
around here for the better, and all you say is "That's nice"? 
Well done mate! 
Cheerio! 
Look who's a douche now! 
Oh, no. 
I know, I know. 
Insert "Dead Raccoon" joke here. 
Dad, what were you thinking? 
I uploaded that picture of me with hair and then things just snow balled out of control. 
And the snow ball killed a raccoon and landed on head? 
At least it gave it's life for a good cause. 
I guess the lesson here is... 
honesty is the best policy. 
Think I would have learned that by now. 
Well my date wasn't completely honest on her profile either. 
I think she went to high school with your Grandfather. 
So, it was a disaster? 
You know, it was strange while I was waiting for her to walk in the door I felt excited. 
Your mother was the love of my life and after she died I never thought I never thought I'd want to meet someone again. But just 
that little spark of anticipation made me realize. 
Life goes on! 
Daddy, that's fantastic. 
Now please take that thing off your head an burn it. 
I would but it's glued on. 
Hey everybody! 
Who wants a balloon filled with this super cool helium? 
Veggie lasagna and side salad. 
Um.. 
Smells like victory. 
Oh, I wouldn't know... 
I lost my sense of smell in 'Nam. 
Oh, I'm s... 
Because here at Padua High we know that we can't enjoy our lunch today unless we think about tomorrow This is Tabitha Cook, Voice of America's Future signing off. 
Ok, I need a copy of that ASAP I'm sending it straight to Gretta Vansestron Cat, I so appreciate what you've done. 
I've always wanted to be socially conscious. 
And you've made it possible for me to do so. 
Within my existing schedule. 
Hey! Saving the planet 
shouldn't be a chore. 
Well, I think it's awful what Blank has done. 
Blank? 
What do you mean? 
Ladies and Gentlemen... 
I am a big fan of tradition I believe a man should open a door for a lady. 
I believe nothing says class like a white Oxford shirt. 
And I believe that everyone has a right to a slice a pepperoni pizza to get them through a tough Monday. 
Bad people have taken your pepperoni away. 
They are force feeding you their Hippy agenda instead. 
But I promise you this, I will fight for your meat! 
In fact, I'm making it the corner stone of my campaign for Padua High student council President. 
Pizza! 
 -Blank! 
Cat, do you want a slice of pizza? 
I ordered on plain cheese. 
I'm pretending this is your face. 
Cat, I told you from the start that I didn't believe in your crusade. 
So you helped me get it passed, just so you can tear it down? 
You are such a douche. 
Well, there's no reason for vulgarities, you got your veggies and I got divisive wedge issue to put me on the map. 
It's a win, win! 
Yea, us! 
Don't try to spin this. 
You betrayed me. 
It's not personal, it's just politics Cameron, here me out. 
I know you are mad, but I have 3 questions to ask you and if you never want to speak to me, fine. 
Did you like Stacy? 
 Yes  Were you excited about Stacy? 
 Yes  So it's theoretically possible that you could be interested in someone besides me? 
Yes, if she wasn't just a theoretical person. 
I know, I did the wrong thing... 
But I did it for the right reasons. 
I thought if you got excited about someone else, then you'd be happy and we could go back to being friends, and it worked! 
Yeah, right up until my complete and utter humiliation.. 
But, You felt something for Stacy. 
What means you getting over me... 
You know, it could have be worse. 
She can walk off with your Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. 
I can't believe you really did all the research. 
You knows even what more unbelievable? 
I'm know addicted to that stupid antique soldier site on Ebay. 
You know. people are going to nuts on 
this German General Eric Ludendorf. 
No way! 
There is a Luddy up for sale? 
 Yea. it's expires in two hours. 
 I'm better going on that I need him to completely my depiction of the 'Spring Offensive of 1918'. 
 I'm missed you, Cameron. 
 Me too.  
Only if you promise no to say, "I told you so". 
You were right about Blank, He such a do... 
Do-haed. 
 I gotta to stop to using that word... 
 So, Blank's a douche. 
 I told you so.  I can't believe 
I let him use me like that... 
Well, you changed things.. 
Because of you, I'm eating my first soy dog. 
What do you think? 
It's not bad. 
But if guys hate meat so much... 
Then why it's taste like a meat? 
 Ahh. 
 No, I'm serious  What's up with that? 
 Well, it's not that I hate the taste... 
It's just that... what ever I'm seeing meat, 
all I see it's little face, saying... 
"Don't eat me". 
UN huh, And how long you been in these hallucinations? 
For years. But this is 
definitely my best one. You... 
eating a soy dog. 
 Hmm... 
I'm not going to grow... man boobs like 
the guy from Entourage right? Right? 
Alright, I forgot to tell you that part. 
Don't worry, You look great in a 'B' cup. 
 Thank you... 
 You're welcome. 
Transcript By Addic7ed.com Team... YesCool, honeybunny, dny238! 
So, we had to write about the day that changed our life. 
I wrote about the day I met you in the girls' bathroom. 
 Still think about it. 
 I wrote about today. 
The day I kicked you hard in the gonads. 
What did you really write about? 
The day I started reading Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex. 
It was the dawn of my feminist awakening. 
And I wrote about a trip to the county fair. 
Oh, God, it sucks. 
Be honest. When you read it, 
was there suckage? 
No, not at all. 
I'm sure Miss Summers will love your paper. 
Hayden proposed. 
The one she's going to hate is mine. 
She's so far from being a feminist. 
It's like she just won The Bachelor. 
What? 
My sister watches it. 
It's so sparkly because I brush it with toothpaste. 
Okay, guys, we need to talk. 
I'm mad at you. 
I read your papers last night, and they were amazing. 
You really opened up and let me in. 
Felix, I could taste the salt water from that first wave you rode. 
Samgui, my cheeks burned with the humiliation of that spelling bee defeat. 
Lucy, I could smell the tarts... 
baking in your Bubby's kitchen right before it burned down. 
I wonder if she could feel Bubby's second-degree burns on the way to the E.R. 
Kat, if I'm not interrupting anything too important... 
would you like to pass the papers out? 
See? 
No suckage. 
 Miss Summers, I think there's a problem. 
 What is it, Kat? 
 Everyone got an A. 
 Well, that's what I thought everyone deserved. 
Besides, how can I grade your memories? 
Well, some memories are more well-written than others. 
Kat, you are so funny. 
 I wasn't kidding. 
 It's 2 karats. 
I just want to hug it. 
So, I was thinking you need a new purse, Dawn. 
How long have you had that one? 
Four years? 
Two months. 
Well, after two months, I give mine to the homeless. 
Oh, and you should see how happy it makes them. 
I know, after school let's go shopping. 
We can get you a new purse. 
And then we can get peddies. 
It's sandal season. 
And then we can get sandals. 
I can't. 
Uh, wear sandals because of this big, gnarly bunion. 
Ew, that just ruined my appetite. 
Hi. Can I get diet soda, 
a chicken breast... 
and an ice cream sandwich? 
No, wait. Forget the chicken. 
Thanks. 
 Four dollars. 
 Can you cover me, Bianca? 
I only have a 50 and a couple hundies. 
Oh, do you have some extra money? 
I only have a 50 and a couple hundies. 
I sold my brother's Lego death star on eBay, and this is all I have left. 
It's so expensive being a teenager. 
Why can't Brad and Angie adopt us? 
At least I've got a shot. 
I'm Asian. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: So, let me recap. 
You thought you deserved an A. 
You got an A, and your GPA will stay a 4.0. 
That is horrible. 
But it is. 
If everyone gets an A... 
that's only good news for the people who don't deserve them. 
 Miss Summers doesn't get that. 
 Miss Summers? 
Oh, I didn't realize we were talking about Miss Summers. 
Is she still dating Mr. Hargrove, 
the health teacher? 
 If his name is Hayden, he just proposed. 
 Uhhuh. 
So, he is the marrying type. 
No, I get it. 
She's like the younger version of me... 
if I was an insipid little manipulator from the South. 
I just think this is kind of a serious issue. 
What's the impetus to excel without the incentive? 
Mm-hmm. I am glad that you've 
brought this to my attention, Kat. 
The problem with women like Miss Summers... 
is they are so hell-bent on getting a man... 
they look upon teaching not as a sacred vocation... 
but as a weigh station to poach other people's boyfriends... 
and marry them and start popping out babies like tic tacs. 
That's why they should be drummed out of the school system. 
No, I don't want to get anybody drummed out. 
I just want everyone to get the grade they deserve. 
Whose side are you on? 
I mean, grade inflation could damage the reputation of Padua High... 
so after raising a little hell with the administration... 
I will no longer be graded alongside that moron... 
who turned in a one-page essay written in highlighter. 
Look at you, fighting inflation. 
Maybe you are capitalist after all. 
Speaking of inflation, can I get an advance on my allowance? 
Stop being a capitalist. I'm not an ATM. 
You can't just push my buttons and get cash. 
Which is why I was thinking I should have a credit card. 
Then I don't need cash. 
Great idea, right? 
 Yeah, dad. Why didn't you think of that? 
 I listened to you blabber on about your grade. 
 Now it's my turn. 
 No, it's my turn. 
 What do you need so much money for anyway? 
 Chastity is finally asking me... 
to hang out with her. 
This is huge. 
I know. 
She never mentioned Chastity. 
Think of it as a business expense, like when you play golf with the head of the hospital... 
only our version of golf is shopping, personal grooming, and insanely expensive yogurt. 
But the social confidence I gain in high school will benefit me for the rest of my life. 
The scary thing is I think you actually believe that. 
This is America, honey. If you want 
extra money, you'll have to get a job. 
 Or be injured on the job. 
 I'm 15... 
I don't drive, I have no work experience. 
I can't even babysit. Everybody 
in this neighborhood has a nanny. 
Why don't you just tell your friends you can't afford these things? 
You don't get California at all. 
And then my dad said I should invite Chastity over to play board games after school. 
Shoot me now. 
Oh, I'm having daddy d�j�-vu. 
This is too depressing to talk about. 
 Did you watch The Hills last night? 
 Yes, boring. 
All they do is sit around and gossip about cute guys and other girls who are being bitches. 
Just like us. 
Only, they get paid for it. 
We're a gazillion times more interesting than Audrina. 
 Let's start a web show. 
 Ooh, can we get rich doing that? 
We'll start small. I bet we can 
make enough for frozen yogurt. 
And let's not forget, The Hills all started with Laguna Beach. 
Cameron, are you free today after school? 
Oh, I was supposed to go visit my grandfather... 
at the nursing home, but I can easily cancel. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, he doesn't recognize me anyway. 
Um, I need your help purchasing a domain name... 
and setting up an online payment system. 
 What are you selling? 
 Myself. 
Dawn and I are starting this new web show. 
It's going to be an intimate look... 
at our private lives. 
Oh, gosh. Who wouldn't 
want to watch that? 
Of course I'll help. 
Thanks, Cameron. 
I'll call you later. 
Sometimes they take a while to drop. 
So do your testicles. 
I- I'm gentle. And a man. 
A gentle man. 
 It used to be a good thing. 
 Dude, you're too gentle. 
You're like that little bear that sells fabric softener. 
Wait, so, how do I change that? 
Do I look like Dr. Phil? 
Look, I know you're scary and tough and all... 
but I really need advice from someone other than my friend Michael. 
There's a reason the only girl he's kissed is his cousin Ruth. 
All right, listen. 
Girls are pack animals. 
You've got the be the alpha dog. 
Show her you've got fangs. 
I should... bite her. 
Dude, seriously? 
You've got to show her that you can protect her. 
Okay, protect her. 
Yeah, maybe I can do that this afternoon while I'm setting up her online commerce. 
Yeah, you can protect her from all that unwanted spam. 
I can be her antivirus software. 
Okay, guys, since one of your fellow classmates complained... 
I've re-graded your papers on the curve... 
as directed by the principal and a spurned, bitter woman. 
For some of you, these grades are going to be upsetting. 
But just know, I'm grading your papers... 
and not the light that's inside you. 
I still got an A. 
Is that my paper? Is it an A-minus? 
My footnotes may have been overkill. 
Mandella. 
A B-minus? 
Who do you think is hotter, Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Reynolds? 
Jakey. Ryan's too chiseled. 
You could cut yourself on his abs. 
Oh, my God. That's our first viewer. 
Five dollars. 
 Chaching. 
 Chaching. 
Ooh, maybe we shouldn't talk about money on the air. Let's keep going. 
Uh, Dawn, I wanted to know which sandals you like better. 
Oh, those. Totally. 
Yeah, me, too. 
 But those are cute, too. 
 I like their buckle. 
Oh, me, too. 
Well, this is fun. 
Two guys watching two girls talk about shoes. 
Oh, man, look how she chews her pencil. 
No, this is wrong. 
I'm supposed to be protecting her. 
Dawn, will you scratch my back? 
I think I have a bug bite. 
A little to the left. 
Now it's getting good. 
You got to go under the shirt. 
Oh, scratch it good. 
No, up. Up. 
I can't watch any more of this. 
Ah, that's it. 
Charlie, yo, you got to check out this website. 
Uh, BiancaAndDawn.org. 
Oh, why did I help her set this up? 
Gosh, I hate being a gentleman. 
You're so much better at this than my friend Ashley. 
She used to tickle my back at summer camp. 
Here, let me try both hands. 
Okay, maybe we should dive back into our geometry homework. 
Or you could scratch my back some more. 
Miss Summers, I'm so sorry to bother you, but wow. 
You look really pretty today. 
Maybe it's that prenuptial glow. 
Thank you, Kat. 
I feel pretty today. 
Listen, I'm sorry I got all worked up about that grade situation... 
but I take this seriously because I really want to get into a top college. 
My dream is to one day wear a class ring from brown. 
Have you ever wanted a ring so badly, it made you a little insane? 
I have, Kat. 
You'll get there. 
It may take an ultimatum, but do not give up. 
Which is why I want to circle back to this B-minus. 
You didn't think I was pretty at all, did you? 
Of course I did. Of course I did. 
And gracious and open-minded. 
I gave you the grade you deserved. 
I know you gave A's to people who wrote about surfing... 
and spelling and the stupid county fair. 
I write about the day that, as a female, I discovered that society valued me less... 
and you give me a B-minus? 
That's grade retaliation, and you know it. 
Kat, astronauts on the international space station can see that you're a feminist. 
I wanted to learn something I didn't know. 
Your essay was predictable, preachy, and quite frankly, shallow. 
If you'll forgive me, I'm late for a cake tasting. 
I'm shallow? 
Okay, according to our web tracking, we went from one to five viewers... 
with the back scratching. We then 
spiked to 22 hits with the pillow fight. 
And then we topped it all out after we bounced on the bed... 
tossing beach balls for a grand total of Drum roll, please... $110. 
We also got a nice cardio workout. 
Win-win. 
Hey, girls. 
Nice beach balls. 
They are our fan base? 
Yuck. 
You want to know what makes it less yucky? 
The cash. 
Hey, girls. So, at the mall Saturday, 
there's a purse sale... 
at needless markups where the pradas are reduced to only $250. 
But don't let the other girls know 'cause I want them to get jelly, okay? 
 We won't say a word. 
 Can't wait. 
 We're going to need a lot more viewers. 
 How do we top beach balls? 
Charlie, you and your friends and your friends' friends... 
should tune into BiancaAndDawn.org 
tonight for some Katie Perry action. 
I'll start popping my popcorn. 
Sign my petition to stop grade retaliation. 
Teachers should not be able to wield grades like weapons. 
All right. 
Mandella. Oh, people at this school 
have no integrity. 
Will you sign this? It would 
be nice to have a real person... 
other than Mr. Balzac 
and Mr. I.P. Freely. 
I can't sign it. 
I don't support your cause. 
Why not? 
 I heard what you said to Miss Summers. 
 Yeah, I thought my grade was unfair. 
And you pooped on my paper to prove your point. 
Mandella, no offense. You wrote 
about going to the county fair. 
Hey, it hurts when someone tells you you're too fat to ride the Ferris wheel. 
 Someone told you that? 
 Oh, my God. You didn't even read it. 
Mandella, I'm so sorry. 
Yeah, well, everything isn't always about you, Kat. 
 Hi, dad. 
 Hi, Dr. Stratford. 
Hey, girls. 
Back again, Dawn? 
I'm going to have to put your name on the mailbox. 
He's trying to be funny. 
 Good one. 
 Well  We're going upstairs to study. 
 I'll let you know when it's dinner time. 
Uh, can you just leave it outside my door? Thanks. 
 It's nice to see her making friends. 
 She finally has someone to braid her hair. 
Dad, I'm going to ask you something, and I want you to tell me the truth. 
Okay. 
 Am I selfcentered? 
 Yes. 
 Seriously? 
 Yes, you're seriously selfcentered. 
How is that even possible? 
I volunteer at soup kitchens. 
My car is a bio-diesel. 
I want to change the world. 
Yeah, but sometimes you're so focused on the plight of the polar bear... 
you forget everything else Eating, sleeping, other people's feelings. 
I can't believe this. 
I'm self-centered. 
You're also a teenager. 
It's a common symptom. 
 I don't want to be common. 
 Which is What's the word? 
Self-centered. 
Look, you have to be different from everyone else. 
 You have to try and  Okay. 
These talks are supposed to make me feel better. Do your job. 
It's natural to be curious about what it's like, don't you think? 
I think it's just normal, teenage experimentation. 
Mm-hmm. 
Do it. Do it. 
Do it. Do it. 
 Aaaaw. 
 So close. 
Bianca! 
Stop making me laugh. 
Sorry, you just look really weird up close. 
Okay. Okay. 
Just close your eyes... 
and just imagine all those sandals and purses. 
Okay. 
This makes up for my parents blocking The L Word. 
Uh-huh. Nice. 
Hot choc-- okay! 
Uh, dad, it's-- it's not what it looks like. 
We were just filming a web show. 
But you're the one who said I should be enterprising. 
And you're the one who wants people to watch your every move. 
Well, you got your wish. 
 But, dad  But, Bianca... 
once you put something out on the internet, you can never take it back. It will live forever. 
 I got it. 
 People like college admissions officers... 
future employers, your future husband could one day see this. 
 Fine, sexy web show, bad. 
 Anyone from your friends... 
to our minister to a child predator could be watching. 
Are we done? 
What exactly do you think those guys are doing while they're watching you? 
Oh, ew! Ew! Ew! 
Now we're done. 
Kat, I just got my new set of Bridal mags. 
Do not come ruin my buzz. 
I rewrote my paper. 
I was hoping you would read it. 
Oh, my God. 
You're like the terminator. 
Did Miss Tharp put you up to this? 
Fine, I'll give you a stupid A. 
Just promise me this helps you graduate early. 
I don't want you to re-grade it. 
I deserved that B-minus. 
It did lack an emotional component. 
But I didn't just want to tell you, "you were right". I wanted to show you. So... 
I wrote about the most mortifying day of my life. 
Oh,"the day my dad bought me my first box of tampons." 
Ew. 
Oh, Kat, I am so proud of you. 
As long as it doesn't end with "and then I became a feminist." 
 Mandella, can we talk? 
 Why don't you write me a note? 
Because unlike some people, I'll actually read it. 
I was wrong. 
I should've read your paper. 
And so last night I did. 
It made me cry. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
It made me realize how much my paper lacked any  Hey, we were talking about me. 
 Right. Sorry, old habits. 
Anyway, I really felt like I was there with you. 
When you described the taste of that cookie you ate to suppress your humiliation... 
I tasted it. 
Shut up. 
For real? 
 What kind was it? 
 Oatmeal Raisin. 
Oh, my gosh. Is he going 
to tell my parents? 
Everyone's talking about your little web show. 
Chastity, I'm sorry. It was 
It was gross and wrong... 
 and we should've  Asked me to be on it. 
I'm hurt. 
I thought we were friends. 
We are friends. That's why 
we're going shopping together. 
Ooh, no, not anymore. 
I'm going with Mandy and Janelle. 
And while we're buying shoes, we're going to commiserate how hurt we were at being excluded. 
 I wonder how they're making money. 
 Ooh, I'm on it. 
What's on today's episode? 
Panty flash? Nip slip? 
 Zip it. The show's been cancelled. 
 Oh, you tease. 
Will you move? 
I'm trying to get to class. 
I can get half the student body at Golden Hill to tune in if you girls go topless. 
 Leave her alone. 
 Cameron? 
 Or what? 
 Or I'll make you sorry. 
Fight! Fight! Fight! 
 You're about to eat a pain pizza. 
 Cameron! 
I know what I'm doing. 
Pick on somebody your own size. 
 Cameron, are you okay? 
 I'm fine fine. 
I would've kicked his ass. 
I have a gold belt in the art of tae kwon do. 
Luckily, it didn't come to that. 
But thanks for trying to defend me, Cameron. 
You're the sweetest guy I know. 
What? 
Who's the one who got the hug, smart guy? 
Yours truly. 
That's right. 
And that's 10 points for theatre. 
Do you know that I used the correct British spelling ... 
... and not the bastarized American version. 
Why must we allways ruin everything? 
I think I get my nipples pierced in protest. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha Or maybe a sexy back tattoo. 
Dad, I'm dropping out of school... 
...to become an adult film star. 
That's nice, honey. 
 She's late for curfew  At least the hounds. 
Do you think, that's funny? 
Hounds run my To-Do-List. 
Dad, relax. She's at a soccer game. 
The odds of her beeing kidnapped  and sold into slavery are very slim. 
Thanks for bringing that up. 
I just were choosing a car accident. 
Sorry. 
But she's my little flower. 
If she's your little flower, what am I? 
You're my big tough cactus! 
Green, spiny and felid, that's great, Dad. 
What I mean is  someone messes with you, you stab him. 
Plus, cactuses are never out late on a school night... 
trying to ....  
Our correct name is cacti.  
Thank god you're home safe, so I can kill ya. 
Daddy, before you say anything I've would have been on time today... 
but I had to save a life tonight. 
What happened? 
After the game we decided to grab something to eat and .. this guy started chocking 
and I just shot my eyelash-curler down his throat in order to safe his life. 
Way to go, McGroover. 
Daddy, maybe one day I become a doctor.. 
..so I can save lives like you every day! 
That's sweet, now blow into this. 
See ... all clear. 
Now, Lady's late, we'll see how long you grounded, when your testresults get back. 
Cat .. go to your sister, honey 
you need to make sure It's her year and I know the drill. 
This family is so ... twisted ! 
I need to show you something. 
Careful, that's borderline sexual harassment. 
How borderline? 
Crearly I'm not working hard enough. 
Same shirts. 
Wow, two things that match. 
Pretty soon you'll be reading. 
So you know about the show tonight. 
Of course. 
That's strange. 
Typically pretty girls are very good liars. 
There. The club ... 
..is called Life Fate. 
Of course you need a fake ID. 
Ahm. 
And you ... need some manners. 
I'm grounded for the entire weekend. 
Apparently I'm irresponsible. 
Can't you leave the house at all, because.. 
... I was thinking, you and I  
could go for a frozen yoghurt. 
Mother Theresa would look shady.  
Hey, Bianca. 
 I heard, you got busted for staying out late last night. 
Eow, Avery, check your sources. 
My dad is stoned 24/7. 
He doesn't care when I come home. 
So I'll see you at the swimteam party tonight, right? 
I'm all over it like mustard. 
I didn't know your dad was a pothead. 
He's not. He's strict, but strict parents... 
... are so 2004. 
That means we've got a secret. 
It also means, I'm screwed. 
Don't worry, I'll never tell. 
Not unless they tickle me. 
No Cameron, I'm screwed, because I didn't know about that party. 
 No biggie, happens to me all the time! 
 Exactly! 
Cameron, I'll now need to tutor you in the language of popularity. 
 Ok. 
 Rule # 1: Information is power. 
Think of it as a pyramid. 
At the top are those who are invited to the party. 
People lower them are inviting people who wanna come... 
... but don't know, where the party is. 
And below them at the very bottom... 
ak.a. the blissfully irrelevant. 
ak.a me. 
Not anymore! 
You just became relevant. 
Because we are going to that party. 
We? Like the sound of that. 
First, we need you to find out, where the party is. 
Why you just don't ask Avery? 
If I ask someone, where the party is ... 
... then I know, I'm on your social level 
and ... 
... I just can't risk that. 
Sorry! 
Popularitiy is a brutal language. 
And they don't even make a .... for it. 
But don't worry, I'm a good teacher. 
Up the zip fellas, ladys in the house. 
There's nobody in here. 
You supposed to wait in that stall. 
I'll guard the door. 
Ahhh, gross. 
Do you know they supposed to pee in the bowl, right? 
Aagh, so who is this guy again? 
No one knows. 
He's called The Wizard and he just knows ... 
... how to get stuff. 
I heard, that last year he got some ? and new kidney. 
I have a hard time believing. 
Okay, what do you want? 
A .... fake ID. 
Sixty bucks and a photo. 
Oh, he's like Chris Angel. 
Dude, did you seen Kelly Morris out there today? 
Can't look at her direction without streching my speedo. 
Well, I guess you're not coming skinny dipping then to my party. 
Dude, you dry off the pool here? 
Think, you should save me. 
Aquaman, what's your name? 
Chip Petterson. 
Just wanted to see who makes these. 
Hmm Bianca ... I know where the party is. 
Oh, where is it? 
It's at Chip Petterson's house. 
 I hacked into the school studens database... 
...and found his address. 
 Ew, like 24. 
 Terrorist bad. 
 I know. 
 So I thought maybe we could grab dinner before. 
Before I do anything, I have to get out of beeing grounded... 
...which means convincing my father that I am... 
...trustworthy, dependable and unlikely 
to have sex.  
So much harder, than stopping terrorists. 
Ok, you can peek. 
Bianca, this looks amazing. 
Ah, should't we say grace. 
We haven't said grace, since you stopped using your Pocahontas-fork. 
Let us pray. 
Thank you Lord for this bountiful harvest. 
And bless the underprivileged and teenaged children in new highschools. 
 Amen. 
 Ok, Bianca, what gives? 
Cat, please. 
Ok, Bianca, what gives? 
Daddy, I've been thinking about my ? recently. 
Ever since I met this great group of kids at school... 
...speaking of which, they invited me 
to this killer bible study tonight. 
 Can I go? 
And the Oscar goes to... 
...Bianca Stratford for lying to her father. 
Zip it, Satan. 
Dad, I really hate to miss it. 
I think tonight I get my purity ring. 
And I think tonight you'll be home with the purity security. 
Dad, is it ok if I go out? 
There's a foreign film festival I want to check out. 
 Well, why should you not? 
That's it? 
When I go out I have to file the flight plans with the FAA.  
But she gets to go out without questions asked? 
Gonna drink? - No. - Drugs? - No. 
Sex? - Gross. 
Satisfied? 
(Exhales) You know what, Dad? 
I gave up everything I worked so hard for back in Ohio. 
Last year I had 42 pictures in the Year Book... 
...as a Freshman,  
thank you very much. 
Yeah. 
Who put pictures of you in a  stupid yearbook.  
That's not the point. 
The point is ... 
... I'm worried that no matter 
how hard I try... 
...I'll never gonna be as  
happy here as I was back home. 
What do you really have going on tonight? 
A party. 
Plain and simple. 
And I'll be home by curfew... 
...and I volunteer for a full battery of tests, I promise. 
Sure, your sister will take you. 
 No. 
 But Dad. 
Cat, please. Just do this one thing for me. 
I have plans tonight and they don't involve carpooling. 
Why can't you be on my side for once? 
Bianca, calm down. I'll take 
you to the party... 
... and I just wait for you 
in the car outside. 
Sure, Dad, why don't you carry me in a Baby-Bjorn? 
Forget it. 
Ohh, so dramatic. 
I know you don't think I'm on your side, but I am. 
I mean, we're sisters. 
I kinda have to love you. 
But tonight...as the first time since 
we've been here I promise. Your next 'can't miss or die 
your social ? party' not only ... 
will I drive you. 
I'll do it without mocking ... 
C'mon, that was funny, c'mon. 
Of course, this is why we're not closer. 
Are you ready for our first swimteam party? 
(Ahm) Actually I was thinking  this could be considered our first date. 
$ 24 plus tip. 
I'll give that. 
I forgot my wallet. 
For your sake I hope your girlfriend has cash. 
Do you have any ... Wait, you... 
..you thought she could be my girlfriend? 
Sorry, Cameron, I ? out of the house  
with lip gloss. 
What size shoes are those? 
This is exciting. 
First time allways is for a party virgin. 
Not for long. 
Take me ... but please be gentle. 
First once a year (???). 
Oh, crap. 
It's been so long, since I've been popular... 
..I forgot about the decoy house. 
A decoy house? 
Like Operation Fortitude... 
...where fake Sherman tanks 
were used to lore... 
...the Germans into believing, that 
the invasion of France... 
...wouldn't take place in Normandy? 
Yeah ... sure. 
That's genius. 
All that hard work ... for nothing. 
What a stupid immature mistake. 
Don't beat yourself up. 
I have to leave, before someone sees me here. 
 Sees us. 
 No, me. 
 It's good for you to be seen here. 
Popularitiy is confusing, but you'll figure it out. 
We need a ride. 
My mom is at a Angry-Devorcee-Meeting tonight. 
Can you call your sister? 
It's a nice night. 
Let's walk. 
Ouch, ouch. 
Ok, hey no need to get physical. 
Hey. 
Oh, I'm so sorry. 
I thought, you were some other guy. 
I'm not saying, that you are a guy. 
You could be a ...butch lesbian... 
...or a transgender male. 
Whatever you are, I, I celebrate you. 
Looking for me? 
Yes... if you're the ladys room. 
Admit it. You're excited to see me. 
Don't flatter yourself. I came for the band. 
I know every song by heart. 
Oh, oh, of course you do. 
You know, I'm sure to you their songs are just a ... 
... groovy soundtrack 
for banging chicks... 
...but their lyrics are poetry. 
I know where I am, it's ? high on a hill, 
is we're racing to canyons of angels. 
Wow, next time I'm banging chicks, I have to pay more attention. 
Eow, ahh, I think I stepped on a syringe. 
It's just a bottle cap, it didn't even break the skip. 
 Let's keep moving. 
 Please, don't make me. 
We have no other options. 
Again, eow, you can  call your sister. 
So she could pick us up on a high horse? 
No, thanks. 
She propably turn me in, and there would be mocking. 
She may surprise you. 
You don't know her. 
Well, I could meet her, when she picks us up. 
Oh no, it's dead. 
Oh well. 
? the chance. 
Uuh, goodie. 
Come on. 
You want me to kiss you. 
The lead singer, yes. 
You, not so much. 
You sure about that? 
I'm just standing here. 
You're the one moving closer. 
I've gotta take this. 
Maybe it's a sign  to work on someone else. 
You'll better be bleeding. 
I need you to pick me up. 
I snaked out with my friend Cameron, who has ridiculously sensitive feet. 
I can't. I'm at the filmfestival. 
Look, if you do this, I'll raise all  Kate Hudson movies from the networks queue. 
(indistinctly speaking) Where do you want me to meet you? 
So you snook out of the house to go to a party? 
But you had the wrong address. 
How does humiliation taste? 
Like a stupid sore ?. 
Now, save the commentary and just drive us home. 
My name is Cameron, by the way. 
I Dad finds out about this, you are gonna spend the ... 
rest of highschool sealed in a plastic bubble. 
So I snuck out of the house. 
It's common behaviour for a human teenager, which you would know, if you were one. 
Were what? 
A human or a teenager? 
Both. 
If we're just gonna sit here, can you crack a window? 
I get carsick. 
Next time you want me to drop everything...  
...and come pick you up, 
remind me... 
...how rewarding this is. 
Isn't it rewarding enough, being little Miss Perfect? 
First---I'm not perfect. 
And second---you know, how much I hate... 
childrens beauty pageants. 
I'm so sick of this. 
I can't wait, untill I can just drive. 
Drive? 
Speaking of driving. 
Dad will never give you a car. 
Maybe you can roll around in that bubble. 
What's this? 
Over 21 is the ... name of 
the movie I went. 
Saw tonight very european ... (?) forefilm of nudity. 
 That's weird. 
 Shut it back, Darth. 
I'm not stupid. 
You went to a club. 
Which means, you have a fake ID. 
No, no, no - stop, stop, stop. 
Get out of there. 
I'm not sure, what amazes me more. 
The fact, that you lied to Dad or that this ID is so good. 
Yeah, you didn't see this. 
Oh, but I did. 
Dad better get your own personal bubble,  'cause you're not sharing mine. 
Fine! 
I won't tell Dad,  you snuck out... 
if you don't tell him about this. 
Deal! 
I'm gonna .... ugh. 
Ohhh. 
I'm sorry. 
Ok, I'll keep Dad occupied, while you sneek back into your room. 
Be quiet. 
Same ? at the rodeo. 
Your spray? 
What's that do? 
 The alcohol brings down the ink. 
 Impressive. 
What's that do? 
Nothing ... I 
just wanted to spit on you. 
Ok, tender moment over. 
Hey, Dad! 
Boy, that movie was long. 
Europans should really lern, how to edit.  
What are you doing? 
Listening to my policeband radio ...  
because your sister snuck out  and isn't answering her phone. 
So far she hasn't  been raped or murdered. 
?. 
These things are amazing. 
Are you sure she isn't here? 
Maybe we should check again in about two minutes. 
Na, I locked the window. 
The only way she's coming home is through that front door. 
Hey, Dad. 
Hmm? 
Ralax! 
 I, I  I'm sure, that she is fine. 
Why she's putting me through this? 
When she comes back, we're having an exorcism. 
Bianca! 
There she is! 
Safe and sound! 
You're lucky. 
Your trial is at 7 a.m. 
Don't move. 
I need to get more specimen cups. 
Dad already knew, you snuked out. 
There's nothing I could do. 
So we both grew up and I'm the one who gets screwed ... 
I don't think so. 
Dad, there's something you should know. 
Not for the mood for excuses, Bianca. 
You need to learn to be more responsible, like your sister. 
You mean, my older sister? 
The one I'm supposed to look up to and emulate. 
The trustworthy daughter. 
Would you like to know, what little Ms. Perfect did tonight? 
She ... 
She went to a ... 
...movie, that featured  
full frontal nudity. 
It's not the same as deceiving your father. 
Fine, give me the cup. 
Don't worry, I closed my eyes. 
What I'm gonna do about her? 
How to cut her some slack. 
I wouldn't drive her to the party tonight, so she snuck out. 
She just wanted to have some fun. 
Yeah, but you don't wanna have fun. 
 I have fun sometimes. 
 Sure, but you go to filmfestivals and things like that. 
Not always. 
I'm just saying...that's why you my 
trustee dependable cactus. 
What? 
This is my fake ID. 
I went and saw a band playing the club tonight. 
Plus, I went alone. 
Horrific things could have happened to me. 
Why you showing me this? 
Ahh, because I don't wanna be a cactus. 
You're trial's at 7:15. 
And when I get through with you, you gonna wish the death-penalty. 
Bianca? 
Yes? 
Make sure, it's your sisters urin. 
Good night, all. 
Good night, Dad. 
Showed Dad my fake ID. 
Are we even now? 
Not until you give me one. 
Let's go. 
Hey, what's going on? 
Just wrapping up another day in paradise. 
Listen, about the other day. 
I just wanted to say... 
I'm sorry. 
I shouldn't have gone through your bag or stabbed you in the foot. 
Ah, don't sweat it. 
But, uh, let's keep our distance. 
The doctor said it would heal faster if I reduced the amount of crazy in my life. 
Crazy? 
I'm not crazy. 
Yes, I'm talking to myself. 
It's a sign of genius. 
Go home and prop it up with pillows. 
It'll really get the blood flowing. 
I think it's getting better. 
I only had to take three pain pills to get through the day. 
I'm sure it will be fine by Friday's game. 
Janelle pulled her Achilles. 
She'll never be okay by Friday's game. 
 I might get to cheer. 
 Nice duplicity, Judas. 
Well, actually, I feel bad for her and happy for me at the same time. 
Pulling an Achilles tendon is a big deal, Bianca. 
 Sometimes, it requires surgery. 
 Oh, my God. Poor Janelle. 
She might be out for months. 
Ugh, what a hypocrite. 
Who's the hypocrite now? 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: ...and then I realized, 
I am a hypocrite. 
How can I call myself an environmentalist when I'm single-handedly... 
exterminating polar bears in my Chernobyl-mobile? 
Why don't you just convert your car into a biodiesel? 
My cousin Jamie did it in a day. 
If he could do it, you definitely can. 
He still wets the bed. 
I would be dispelling that whole gender stereotype that women can't fix cars. 
Pro-environment and pro-female. 
Mandella, I love this idea. 
You're a genius. 
I'm the Marcy to your peppermint patty. 
Oh, Bianca, hi. I had something 
I wanted to tell you. 
What was it? Oh, right. 
I'm not gay. 
Oh. Sorry, Cameron. 
I don't know why I'd even think that. 
Maybe it's because you're so sweet and sensitive and you watch project runway. 
Because of sexy Heidi Klum, and the way she says "auf wiedersehen". 
 I'm straight. 
 Oh, got to go. 
Remind to give you back your Dreamgirls DVD later. 
I'm not into musicals. 
I'm into Motown. 
Hi, Chastity. Hi, Joey. 
Your hair looks great today. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
So, listen, I wanted to let you know I memorized all the routines... 
in case you need somebody to fill in for Janelle on Friday night. 
Oh, I don't think I can help you with that, but you get a big "P" for persistence. 
Don't forget, it takes ten girls to make a pyramid. 
Do you mind sharing the top with Michelle? 
Um, Joey, honey, shift to neutral, okay? 
 Shift? 
 Stay here. 
Okay, Joey's about to dip below the GPA threshold for football. 
He needs a "B" on his chemistry project, or he can't play. 
Get it for him, and you cheer Friday. 
But I'm not Joey's lab partner. 
Mandy is. 
And Mandy's on her second sophomore year, so make it happen. 
And go light on the jewelry. 
He's easily distracted. 
So what's distracting you from setting the table? 
I'm turning my giant carbon footprint into a cute little baby foot... 
by converting my car into a biodiesel. 
 Huh, by yourself? 
 You think a woman can't do it? 
Sure she can, if she's a mechanic. 
You do realize... 
that this is your only car, and if you destroy it, I'm not getting you another one. 
Relax, dad. 
I printed a comprehensive instruction manual off the internet. 
Got nine out of ten stars. 
Kat, I'm sure somewhere on the internet, there's a manual on how to deliver a baby... 
but it doesn't mean you know your way around a uterus. 
Why can't my dad just be an accountant? 
As long as she thinks you're gay, she's never going to see you as leading man material. 
You're like Hugh Jackman before he was Wolverine. 
Which means, if you want to run up your sex appeal... 
 you need  Adamantium claws. 
No. No. 
A- a- a big-screen movie moment. 
Visualize with me. 
 What am I seeing? 
 You. 
Got it. 
 On Bianca's doorstep. 
 Yes. 
 Wet. 
 Okay. 
And shirtless. 
 What? Why am I shirtless, exactly? 
 Because it's sexy. 
Trust me, girls eat this stuff up. 
So I show up at her house, shirtless and wet. 
 Yeah. 
 Then what do I say? 
You don't say anything. 
You just take her in your arms and lay a fat one on her. 
So really, this is less like Hugh Jackman... 
and more like Ryan Gosling in the notebook. 
Yeah, you see, it's that kind of comment that makes people wonder. 
 Hey. 
 I'm your new lab partner. 
Where's Mandy? 
She really wanted to work with Leon, so I swapped her seats. 
 Okay. 
 So, um, I was thinking that... 
we can get together after school today at my house and start working on our project. 
Uh, okay. 
Which do you want to pick? There's effects 
of pressure on the volume of a gas... 
 density determination, or  What kind of snacks do you have? 
Do you have those little baby carrot sticks? I love those. 
Yeah. 
I can get carrot sticks. 
Okay. 
Density determination it is. 
Well, there she is. Little lady 
who thinks she can convert a car... 
using a manual she found on the internet. 
All because she believes in the hype about global warming. 
I'm sorry, is this auto shop or 1952? 
You're just like my wife. 
After watching some show on HGTV, she tried to rewire an antique lamp. 
 Almost electrocuted herself. 
 Maybe it was a botched suicide attempt. 
Try not to break a nail. 
Back to work, boys. 
 Don't even bother. 
 Excuse me? 
Oh, Brad, I'm a girl. 
I can't do anything for myself. 
Please help me. 
Just because I'm husky doesn't mean I'm so desperate... 
for a pity flirt that I'll work my butt off for you. 
Girls and your witchy ways. 
No. No. 
Not falling for that again. 
 I guess a cuddle is out of the question. 
 You can cuddle with me, kitten. 
I like a woman who has no idea what she's doing. 
I just need a crowbar, and when I find one, you may want to run. 
And I'll run slow, so you could catch me. 
Hey. 
Can I borrow your crowbar? 
You got to be kidding me. 
Okay, so first, we need to measure the mass of a clean, dry object. 
This will do. And we put it on 
the laboratory balance, and... 
These would be really hard to peel. 
I guess that's why they come like this in the bag. 
Um, Joey, over here. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm just bored. 
Look, we just need to power through this so that we can get a good grade. 
And why-- why do I need a good grade? 
So you can get into college and play football and stuff. 
But I want to be a model. 
How's football and college going to help my runway walk? 
Wow. You're really serious 
about this modeling stuff. 
I keep my body fat at 4%, I sleep in paraffin wax... 
and I even taped off a runway in my bedroom. Modeling's my dream. 
 Nobody gets it. 
 I do. 
I'm a dreamer, too. 
I even have a dream book. 
 What's a dream book? 
 Oh, my God. 
Only the greatest thing in the world. 
I've separated it into actionable goals from now until the year 2024. 
On deck currently, become a cheerleader. 
20 says she quits by the end of the day. 
Ah, come on. If everyone bets against her, 
there's no point in having a pool. 
Patrick, you want to bet on her? 
Not while she's anywhere near power tools. 
I'll bet on myself. 
Careful. That money could 
buy you a bunch of tampons. 
Listen. For the record, I didn't even know 
you were in auto shop, okay? 
So if you think I'm here for you, you're sadly mistaken. 
Hey! 
What the hell? 
 Oh, my  I got it. 
Can we just agree on... 
a minimum, safe distance or do I have to file a restraining order? 
Don't flatter yourself. 
And I'm not leaving until I'm finished. 
And then, in about 15 years... 
after I sold my cosmetics line to a major conglomerate... 
I'll start adopting babies from all over the world. 
Starting with Uzbekistan. 
Wow. And all I want is to be 
the first male supermodel. 
And no, I don't count Tyson Beckford. 
He doesn't have a fragrance. 
 Hello? 
 Get back to work. 
Uh, Chastity... 
 where are you? 
 Behind you. 
Just kidding. 
Listen, Joey has the attention span of a cheerio, so keep him focused, okay? 
Okay, sweet dreams to the dreams book. 
Oh, my God. 
I am so sorry. 
I I'll just Put this in the washer. 
And then the dryer, and then... 
back on you. 
Don't worry. 
Models got to be naked a lot. 
It's good practice. 
Hey, Bian Joey Donner. 
In the flesh. 
Do I know you? 
Cameron James. We've been going 
to the same school since first grade. 
 Cameron. 
 Cameron James. 
Cameron James. 
Oh, Bianca's gay friend. 
Man, I- I really admire you for busting stereotypes. 
I'm actually trying to do the same thing. 
I want to show the world that straight guys can be models... 
in the same way that you're trying to show the world that that gay guys don't have to have six-pack abs. 
Yeah. 
 You looking for Bianca? 
 Nope. Just out jogging. 
Dude, you sweat a lot. 
It's, uh, been a problem. 
Sweating. 
So just do me a favor. 
Don't tell her I was here. 
 Oh, okay. 
 At all. 
Ever? Okay. 
See you later, Cameron. 
Hey, you have a good jog. 
Sticky. 
Ow, ow, ow. We're just working 
on a science project. 
My daughter is not, and never will be, enrolled in anatomy. 
 No. Science. 
 Dad! 
Look, I'm a surgeon. Come back here again 
like that, I'm going to cut something off. 
Daddy, I'll be back in a second. Put your 
head between your legs and breathe deeply. 
Count to ten. 
I'm sorry. 
He has some sort of disease that makes him cranky. 
 I think it's "manopause". 
 No worries. 
Um, you should have something to wear home. 
 Yeah. 
 Here. 
Thanks. 
Sorry. 
It's kind of small. 
Wow. I guess it's true. 
Real models can wear anything. 
Thanks, Bianca. 
Wow. You know, 
most people have a forehead. 
You've got a five-head. 
Five. I mean, that's what all 
the big agencies are looking for. 
It's like a billboard on your face. 
 I never knew that. 
 Yeah. 
 Your face is perfect. 
 No. 
Yours is... 
which is why you shouldn't let them hurt it at the football game. 
Your face is your moneymaker. 
See you tomorrow. 
Dad, in and out. 
Come on, kitten. Give up. 
Luis will take you to dinner. 
Thanks, but I've got a granola bar in my bag. 
Girls like you always have granola bars, and then you get mad at guys like me... 
because we eat red meat. 
Well, guess what? 
I don't care what you think. 
I'm going to clean up on this bet... 
and I'm going to spend your money on porn and cigars and women who don't talk back. 
Well, make sure you save some for therapy. 
And maybe you should save some for anger management. 
 Aw, Kat. 
 Don't say it. 
I know. You were right. 
I can't do this. 
Have some lasagna. 
Thanks. 
 Why didn't you call me sooner? 
 This is a car, not a uterus. 
 You just would have called a mechanic. 
 A mechanic. What a good idea. 
I should be able to do this myself. 
I'm not some damsel in distress. 
No, you're my "I don't give a damsel" in distress. 
You're also the most stubborn person I know. 
Remember your hunger strike in third grade? 
It worked. 
They put a salad bar in. 
The point is that... 
you dig your heels in and never let go, but sometimes it's okay to ask for help. 
Let's go home and we'll call a mechanic in the morning. 
Nope. 
I can do this. 
 Honey, this is crazy. 
 No, it's perseverance. 
I'm not going to let him be right about me. 
Him who? 
The proverbial him, meaning... 
all the guys in this stupid shop class. 
They all bet money that I would fail. 
All right. 
We can figure this out. 
You've got me till my C-section at 8 a.m. 
Can't believe they gave this thing nine out of ten stars. This is stupid. 
It doesn't even make I'm sorry. 
Usually when teenagers have their shirts off and are wet, magic happens. 
Magic might have happened. 
Just not with me. 
Okay, okay, new movie. 
Black Hawk Down. 
You're dropped into Somalia with no chance for victory. 
It's time to cut your losses and retreat. 
This isn't war, Michael. 
This is love. 
 And love's a battlefield. 
 How am I supposed to do that? 
We're in the same classes. 
I'm her French tutor. 
It's not like I can be medevaced out of her life. 
Aversion therapy. 
Put this on your wrist. 
Every time you think about Bianca, snap it. 
Rumor has it this is how Jen got over Brad. 
Oh, oh, there she is. 
Do it. 
Oh, God! 
What the hell happened with Joey? 
I spilled grape soda on him, so I was just trying No, no, no, no. No. 
Why is he quitting football? 
 What did you say to him? 
 Nothing. 
I would never tell him to quit football. 
I'm sucking up to you, remember? 
Did you or did you not tell him to protect his face? 
I was just being cute. 
Mmm. 
Cute. 
Cute is that cute little kitty on YouTube playing "chopsticks". 
Get him back on the team, or you'll be logging more hours in your mascot suit... 
than the freaks at a furry convention. 
 Joey. 
 Fivehead! 
I feel as if I may have lead you down the wrong path. 
There's so much competition in the modeling world. It's really cutthroat. 
Which is why I made my very own dream book. 
 You inspired me. 
 You made a dream book? 
Yeah, and I put it into sections, just like you. 
One, develop my signature runway walk... 
two, clear up my "bacne", and three... 
 wax my  Joey. 
Dream books are just for fun. 
They don't actually make anything happen. 
The odds are stacked against you. 
I don't want to see you get hurt. 
You don't think I could be a model? 
I think you'll be a great model. 
Which is why you should play football. 
How can football help me? 
It's not face-friendly. 
Oh, look at David Beckham. He's one 
of the biggest male models in the world. 
He even has a fragrance. 
And how did he get that? 
 By playing? 
 Soccer. 
 Which in England is called? 
 Soccer. 
Football. 
By playing football, you'll increase your chances at getting discovered. 
You're right! 
Bianca, you're so smart. 
I got to go tell the coach before he gives my jersey away. 
Um, don't worry. 
It has your name on it. 
I know, which is why I don't want him to give it away. Duh. 
Did you remember to recalibrate your flux capacitor? 
This is a straight veggie oil conversion, not a time machine. 
Kitten, stock fuel pumps can't handle the thicker veggie oil. 
That's why I've rigged a parallel auxiliary fuel pump that's switchable at the dash. 
 You did that yourself? 
 Didn't even break a nail. 
I think I love you for real. 
No joke. 
Please start. Please start. 
Please start. Please start. 
Pay up. 
 This will buy a lot of crisco. 
 Ah. 
Okay. I'm impressed. 
So you're going to take her for a ride? 
Yup. Now we can really 
keep our distance. 
Oh. 
Bye, fellas. 
Cameron, guess what? 
I get to cheer today. 
The uniform doesn't fit, but who cares? 
You'll be there, right? 
 I wouldn't miss it. 
 Yay! 
You know what? 
I don't want to get over her. 
I want to be the guy in the movie who never gives up... 
and eventually gets the girl. 
Yeah. 
I don't watch those movies. 
Unless there's nudity. 
What? 
* I need a guy * * That I can call my baby * * The kind of guy * * That treats me like a lady... * 
Ah! Sweet mother. 
What the hell are you doing here. 
It is 11:00 at night. 
Isn't it obvious? I'm a vampire, 
I need permission to enter. 
Permission not granted. 
Good thing I'm not really a vampire. 
Vinyls. 
How old school. 
I keep it real. 
 I've never seen this Beatles album. 
 It was only released in the U.K. 
Those were my mom's. 
She was a real purist. 
She sounds cool. 
She was. 
So again, what is with the breaking and entering? 
I had something I wanted to tell you. 
Can I borrow Bior� A male in your bedroom? 
And he's cute. 
 Am I sleepwalking again? 
 Shh! 
Dad is going to hear you. 
Girls! 
Oh, my God. Crap, crap, crap. 
Get out. Get out of here. 
Get out, get out, get out. 
Just a second, Dad. 
I'm indecent. 
And in so much trouble. 
I'm loving this. 
I'm coming in! 
Spooky. 
There's a brush fire. 
The whole neighborhood's evacuating. 
 We have to get out of this house right now. 
 Just give me two minutes to get changed. 
 We don't have time. 
 Aw. 
We had time. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: Excuse me. Stand back. 
Baby on board. 
Can you girls handle check-in? 
I'm going to volunteer at first aid. 
Who knows? Maybe I'll get 
to deliver a fire baby. 
I feel like a poodle at a dessert buffet. 
What I wouldn't do for a flat iron right now. 
People could be losing their homes, and you're worried about your hair. 
Ugh. You're worse 
than Anderson Cooper. 
Ooh. 
You're looking for Patrick. 
You like him. 
 No, I don't. 
 You want to kiss him. 
Really? Are you five? 
I'm just excited to know that you're capable of physical attraction. 
Now maybe I won't have to suffer the burden of caring for you and your cats when you're old. 
Sorry. Can't take you seriously 
with your hair like this. 
Bianca. 
Face forward and don't say anything, or I'll tell Patrick you want to have his babies. 
Bianca, can you believe this? 
Fires are so scary. I'm totally traumatized. 
And what you're wearing doesn't help. 
I sleep in the nude, so I had to borrow these. 
Wow. 
These are desperate times. 
You wouldn't happen to have anything less flannel I could borrow? 
Sorry. Someone once returned something 
with a snag so I don't do that anymore. 
But if you find something, we'll be in room 103. 
It's where all the cheerleaders are sleeping. 
Sure. 
Oh, oh, oh. And could you 
get me some more blankets? 
My resting body temp is 98.1, 
which means I'm freezing... 
and Frau Stick in the mud up there would only give me two. 
It is so sad when people abuse their power. 
I keep forgetting you're related to that. 
I can't believe her broomstick didn't burn in the fire. 
Hi, I can take it from here. 
I am an OBGYN. 
Oh, thank God. The only thing 
I know about delivering babies... 
 I learned from "Gone with the Wind". 
 Do you have a certificate or something? 
Just want to make sure you're not one of those kooks... 
that goes around saying they're a gynecologist so they can look at my... 
lady business. 
But that's one of the perks of the job, ma'am. 
Just kidding. 
Give me your hand and relax. 
What are you, about seven months in? 
Guess what. Everyone's fine. 
This bun's not coming out of the oven tonight. 
 Lie back and relax, okay? 
 Okay. 
But I'm keeping my knees closed. 
You should have thought of that seven months ago. 
 I'll be here. You don't have to stay. 
 Oh, that's okay. I don't mind. 
I mean, what else am I going to do? 
Rank the stuff I'll miss the most... 
if my house burns down? 
I think I'd miss my house the most. 
Oh, not me. 
It reminds me of my ex-husband and his love of linoleum. 
It's everywhere. 
Oh, my memory foam pillow. 
That's what I'll miss the most. 
I spent a lot of lonely nights trying to get the depressions just right, you know? 
Dude, there are vulnerable hot chicks all over this place... 
looking for a shoulder to cry on. 
I know it's wrong, but I love this fire. 
Yeah, me, too. Now I know 
what Bianca wears to bed. 
In a new development, authorities believe... 
the canyon brushfire may have been started by homemade pyrotechnics. 
Homemade pyrotechnics? 
Yeah, like fireworks, flares Or model rockets. 
Michael, that model rocket we launched yesterday in my backyard it never came down. 
You think we started the fire? 
No, there's no way. 
All we did was push a button. 
That shot a vessel of highly flammable balsa wood containing gunpowder into bone-dry brush, igniting a gigantic conflagration. 
Uh-oh. 
Girls, I'm here for you in your time of need, okay? 
So why don't we go around the circle and share what we're scared of losing the most? 
My vintage collection of Us Weeklies. 
They're irreplaceable. 
My ionic featherweight hair dryer. 
 It blows so hard. 
 Mmhmm. 
If my house burns down, I'll lose every single photo of my mother. 
Oh, you poor thing. 
I'm sure your house will be fine. 
Aw, so sad. 
I know exactly how you feel. 
My mother is in Brazil, getting her second face lift. 
What if she doesn't wake up from the anesthesia? 
If I could talk to her right now, I would say, "Mom, you're perfect just the way you are." 
God, I remember this one time when my mom went out of town Dawn, you had your turn, okay? 
Wow. 
You know what? 
Now that I think about it... 
I should really be with my parents right now. 
They're probably worried sick about me. 
Yeah, me, too. 
My dad gets so needy in a crisis. Sorry. 
But you guys, wait. We haven't 
finished our little share circle. 
I'm here to listen as long as you want to talk. 
Thanks, B. 
Maybe Michelle should be in that mascot suit instead of you. 
Keep talking. 
I'm still listening. 
You know what we need? 
Hot chocolate. 
Yeah. No sugar, no whipped cream. 
Wait, whipped cream... 
but only if it's the fake kind, okay? 
Oh, and you can have yours however you like it. Go. Thank you. 
Bye-bye. 
Scoot, scoot. 
There you go, ma'am. 
Does this have seeds in it? 
I have diverticulitis. 
I'm not sure, actually. 
Oh, who's that you're undressing with your eyes? 
Your boyfriend? 
No. Just this guy I know. 
Oh, missy, I wasn't born yesterday. 
I can see that. 
So, you made it. 
Where's your family? 
I killed them all. 
They were slowing me down. 
Natural disasters do bring out the best in people. 
So, what was your big epiphany? 
You're okay. 
Did you get my messages? 
I sent you, like, a million texts. 
When are we going to talk? You said 
you needed to tell me something. 
It's not like that. 
Sure it's not. 
Enjoy your chat. 
Are you mad at me? 
Oh! 
Have you ever done something you've regretted? 
Giving you advice, because you keep coming back. 
Okay, but have you ever done something you're really sorry about? 
What did you do? 
I think I started the fire. 
Let me guess. 
You set off a model rocket. 
How'd you know? 
It was either that or you're setting your farts on fire. 
So what's the problem? 
The problem is the guilt is eating me alive. 
I'm thinking of confessing. 
Well, it's not like you did it on purpose. 
You're right. That's it. 
I'll tell them what happened... 
that it was an accident, and I'm really sorry. 
Yeah. Worst case scenario, 
you get five, ten years. 
You can handle prison. 
And with a face like yours, you'll have a husband in no time. 
Oh, goodie. 
You're back. 
Um, what are non-cheerleaders doing here? 
 A volunteer brought them in. 
 Okay. 
 Then you can volunteer to take them out. 
 But they brought homemade baklava. 
With real honey. It's super delicious. 
You'll love it. 
And this is Sarab. 
He's only 11, and he speaks 3 languages, including Russian. 
Pleasure it is to meet you. 
Oh, how cute. 
You talk like Yoda. 
So cute. Cuteness. 
Yeah, we're going to need to get them out of here, and by we, I mean you. 
But there's plenty of room here. 
Bianca, Bianca. 
I thought this was supposed to be bonding time for us... 
to really cement our friendship. 
 Isn't that what you wanted? 
 Yeah, of course. 
Then get them moved to another classroom. 
And when you get back, I'll flat iron your hair. 
Oof. 
Can't wait. 
Go after him already. 
Seize the moment. 
Life is short. 
Trust me, I know. 
You're old. 
I get it. 
Do you have keys to any of the classrooms? 
I need you to open one. 
Chastity needs more room for her ego? 
Someone brought a family into our room and she's a bit territorial. 
Too bad. Tell Genghis Chastity 
that there's a fire going on... 
 and we all need to pull together. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
We are the world. 
I get it. 
 Can't you just open a door, please? 
 Not a chance. 
Why can't you just help me once? 
Why does everything you do have to be about principles? 
Why does everything you do have to be about Chastity? 
 It's pathetic. 
 Fine. 
I guess you'd rather be handing out water bottles to old ladies... 
rather than making out with Patrick Verona, but you're right. 
I'm the one who's pathetic. 
Now that her contractions have stopped, do you want to share this bottle of wine... 
I can't pronounce? 
Well, with a wine this nice, it's a miracle you remembered your kids. 
Yeah, my ex and I were saving it for our 30th anniversary. 
Now, instead of toasting that tragedy, we can toast this one. 
 May I? 
 Please. 
What's your deal, anyway? You married? 
Separated? Big fat cheater? 
Widowed. 
I'm so sorry. 
 Was it recent? 
 Yes. Seven years. 
Oh. 
Well, different people move on at different speeds. 
So... that's totally normal. 
Ish. 
You seem to bounced back pretty well. 
 Mind sharing your secret? 
 Therapy. 
Thousands and thousands of dollars of therapy. 
Actually, I'm just now getting back to the dating scene myself. 
 Ah. How's that going? 
 Online dating is brutal... 
but I'm getting the hang of it. 
Now I'm an entertainer in my early 30s. 
I should help you with your profile. 
And I've got Photoshop. 
 Should I be thankful or offended? 
 Grateful. 
Chastity, I'm sorry. 
We can't relocate the family. 
But we can view this as an opportunity to learn about another culture. 
 It'll be fun. 
 It would be fun. 
But it would also be horribly selfish of us. 
Think about what they must be going through, Bianca. 
They probably lived in very small huts in whatever country they came from. 
This room must seem overwhelmingly large for them. 
We should totally put them in the janitor's closet. 
They'd be more comfortable there. 
 But  Ooh, but, but. 
Doot doot. But nothing. 
Unless you want to learn carpet weaving from your new friends. 
I know. You could weave 
yourself a new mascot suit. 
That's really not very nice. 
We actually do weave beautiful carpets. 
See? 
Chastity, I'm not putting a family of six in a closet. 
Oh, wow. 
Okay, I'm going to pretend this little temper tantrum never happened. 
I know you're really stressed about losing all your dead mom stuff. 
Yoda, tell your clan to start packing. 
You are such a bitch! 
 What did you say to me? 
 You heard me. 
You are a manipulative, conniving, mean little shrew of a person... 
and I am sick of taking your crap. 
Can't you see that nobody likes you? 
That was harsh. 
Don't jump. 
Aw, I don't have to. 
You're here now. 
Okay, jump. 
I'm only three stories up. 
All I'd do is break a leg. 
It'd still be worth it. 
Come check this out. 
It's really beautiful. 
If you don't think about all the homes being destroyed. 
Look over there. 
Oh! 
 Ah. 
 Oh! 
See? 
You don't want me to jump. 
You're such a jerk. 
Now I can tell you what I wanted to tell you. 
Ooh, I'm on pins and needles. 
Let me guess. 
Is it the same thing you wanted to tell the girl downstairs? 
Oh, I like it when you're jealous. 
I'm not jealous. I'm appalled. 
There's a difference. 
Look, I was going to tell her she should stop stalking me. 
Big words from the guy who shows up unannounced... 
in my bedroom window at 11:00 at night. 
 That's way past visiting hours. 
 You talk a lot. 
Is that what you wanted to tell me? 
Sure. 
 No, seriously. 
 Oh, seriously. 
Okay. 
I realized why I find you interesting. 
Mm, do tell. 
You're different from other girls. 
You have a mind of your own. 
That must be a refreshing change for you. 
It is. You're not 
all clingy and needy. 
We can just make out and it doesn't have to be this whole big thing. 
Right. 
Right. 
Because I'm a total slut. 
But I have a mind of my own. 
 No, that's not what I meant. 
 Well, what did you mean? 
I meant you're not living some fairy tale where I'm your Prince Charming. 
Trust me, no one would mistake you for Prince Charming. 
Prince Charles, maybe. 
Ah, and we were having such a nice time. 
Unbelievable. 
I'm worried about losing my home, all of my stuff... 
every memory, and you just want to hook up. 
Why do have to make everything so difficult? 
What can I say? 
I'm not easy. 
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you... 
but I'm hot and tired and you were acting like Janice Dickinson. 
Well, excuse me for not wanting to share my room with the entire USSR. 
So what you said, was it true? 
Yeah. 
And here I thought we were going to bond tonight, Bianca. 
Bond? More like bondage 
and I was your gimp. 
Get me hot chocolate. 
Fetch me blankets. Rub my feet. 
You're using me, just like you use all of us. 
Wait. 
Me, using you? 
You want to be a cheerleader more than Hillary Clinton wants to be president. 
That's the only reason you even speak to me. 
Do you think it's easy being me? 
I am the most popular girl in school. 
And some would argue the prettiest, too. 
I've got nowhere to go but down. 
And I know that every girl in this school would crush me in a second... 
if she had the chance to take my place. 
I don't have any friends. 
At least not any real ones. 
I guess I'm all alone. 
That's not true. 
I'm here. And you're right, 
I was using you. 
And I'm sorry. 
I accept your apology. 
Um, is there anything you want to say to me? 
Mm, don't do it again? 
How about "I'm sorry for using you, too, Bianca"? 
Okay. 
What you said. 
And, um... 
I shouldn't have said that about your mom. 
Thanks. 
You know, I kind of like you when you're not ordering me around. 
That's so sweet. And I like you, 
when you're not being whiny and insecure. 
Oh. No hugging. 
And just an FYI. 
I'm not making you a cheerleader just 'cause you're my best friend. 
Uh, okay. 
So you're saying for my profile I should specifically avoid saying I'm a gynecologist? 
Yes. Doctor is fine. 
All right. 
You're great at this. 
Can I have your number? 
I mean, I'd like more help with my profile. 
Can I be honest? First piece of advice, 
you got to lose that ring. 
Yeah, I know. 
Would you believe that I've worn it so long I think it's stuck? 
Second piece of advice Butter. 
I can't take it anymore. Slap the shackles 
on me and take me upriver. 
There's no punishment greater than the knowledge... 
that I caused people to lose everything they care about. 
Huh? 
I started the fire. 
It was a freak thing. 
I miscalculated the trajectory of the parabola. 
Look, I don't know what your trip is, bro, but they already caught the guys that started it. 
Two college dudes smoking some tasty cloves. 
That's fantastic. 
Oh, Bianca. 
I'm so happy to see you. 
I feel wonderful. Let's hang out 
and talk all night long. 
Okay, but we can't do anything too physical. 
If I snag these clothes, I'm dead meat. 
Everyone, the fire is officially contained. 
You can all return to your homes. 
Thank God. Now we don't have 
to stay here and talk all night. 
I'll see you tomorrow at school. 
Bye, Cameron. 
Look, I'm off-duty. 
Fire's over. 
So I guess I don't have to show you what your boyfriend left for you. 
He's not my boyfriend. 
Over there. 
Missy, lighten up. 
I know a lot of cat ladies who started out like you. 
I'm so happy we can go home. 
This evacuation has been nothing but drama. 
The fire is out, the house is safe. 
No babies were born in the gym. 
We may all return to our lives. 
Come here, come here. Life is great. 
 Are you drunk? 
 Only on life, my darling. 
And $500 worth of wine. 
I'm driving. 
...On "10Things I hate About You!"... 
What the hell are you doing here? 
And at 11:00 at night? 
You're different from other girls. 
You're really serious about this modeling stuff? 
Modeling's my dream. 
This whole time you've been telling me this is about your principles, you forgot to mention your principle drives a motorcycle. 
You said yourself you don't even know this guy. 
If I learn he's bad news, he's gone. 
And now it's time for our final pose-off in the male division, where our models will compete to see who rocks it in the same outfit. 
This week, our outfit is the most unforgiving yet biker shorts. 
Good luck, gentlemen. 
Please take your places on the Poser platform. 
Oh, my God. 
They slathered so much baby oil on Trent B., 
he's going to slip and hurt himself. 
Huh? 
And pose. 
I'm sorry, babe. 
I I just I can't concentrate with these cupcakes sitting right in front of me. 
Uh-oh. Trent S. is 
doing that weird thing with his foot again. 
Still? 
Even after Rachel ripped him a new one last week? 
...final deliberation. 
This is why I hate former ballet dancers who try and model. 
It just makes me furious. 
I would never book Trent S. 
He disgusts me. 
Trent S. is the light. 
He sparkles. He has, 
uh, the model essence. 
I would buy anything from him. 
My complaint with Trent B. 
is that there's absolutely nothing paradoxal about him. 
Well, I think that we have finally made our decision, so let's bring the Trents out. 
Joey, she's announcing the winner. 
What's taking so long? 
The male that has won this week's Biggest Poser, and is guaranteed a spot on the final Pose Off, is... 
Trent S. 
Trent S. 
Yes. 
Aspiring models, please send in your audition tapes. 
Let's see if you have what it takes. 
I've got what it takes. 
Hi. 
Oh, my God. You scared 
the bejesus out of me. 
I missed you. 
What are you What are you doing here? 
Aren't you going to say hello? 
Hello. 
You've got to go now. 
If my dad finds you here, he'll send me to convent, and I have a real problem with organized religion. 
If I'm really quiet, can I stay tonight? 
No way. 
A, I'm not going to sleep with you until we talk about sex and its implications, and B, when and if we do do it, it will be nowhere near my father. 
You said "do do." 
Can I just crash here? 
I got kicked out. 
What happened? 
I wet the bed. 
Patrick, seriously. 
If you're going to keep talking all night, I'll just sleep in the park. 
No, stay. 
If you were horrifically murdered, it would really ruin my day. 
Thanks. 
Which side do you want? 
On the floor. 
Okay. 
But in the middle of the night, if you decide you want me... 
I'll be right here. 
 Hey, hey   Hey, hey  Translate By Mumy . 
Patrick. 
What are you doing? 
Patrick. 
Patrick? 
Oh, my God, this is so not cool. 
Patrick? 
Did I just eat this? 
And 11 of its friends. 
Oh, crap. 
I sleepwalk sometimes. 
You don't say. 
Go upstairs quietly. 
I'll clean this up. 
Where are my cupcakes? 
Don't look at me. 
You know how I feel about processed sugar. 
Dad, did you eat the cupcakes I baked for the cheerleaders again? 
Not this time. 
And that time, I was going through a rough patch. 
Celebrities were dropping like flies. 
Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson on the same day. 
This doesn't make any sense. 
If you didn't eat my cupcakes, then who did? 
Wasn't that overactive ass kissy blond boy here last night? 
There's no way Joey would have eaten them. 
He couldn't even stand to have them in the room, he was so tempted. 
Well, it sure sounds like he could have eaten them. 
Hey, is it cool if I borrow your car after school tomorrow? 
I'll see you in class. 
Later. 
Kat, I don't have time to make out right now. 
What's going on with you? 
I come back from cleaning up your cupcake carnage, and you're gone. 
Turns out your floor isn't that comfortable. 
Patrick, this is serious. 
You were sleep eating, which, according to whatsthedealwithmaleness.com, 
is brought on by stress. 
That's fascinating. 
Can I borrow your car or not? 
Why do you need it? 
Where's your bike? 
It's been confiscated. 
By your parents? 
What happened? If you're 
in some kind of trouble, just tell me. 
Okay, I'm in trouble. 
What's going on? 
What's going on is you won't stop asking me questions. 
Ha ha ha! 
Well, you're not borrowing my car now. 
Thanks. 
So I've decided on an angle for my Biggest Poser audition tape. 
Ready? 
The all-American boy. 
I'm going to be the studly football player, and you ladies are going to be the smoking hot cheerleaders by my side. 
What do you guys think? You in? 
Of course we are, right, Chas? 
Oh, sure. 
I'll be sure to dial back my charisma so I don't steal your focus. 
Thanks. 
I'm super psyched. 
Joey, did you by any chance eat my cupcakes last night? 
No, why? 
Does it look like I did? 
No. It's just that 
my cupcakes were missing this morning. 
But if you say you didn't eat them Yo, I got a lawn. 
I'll be right there. 
Okay, I'll call you with the dates. 
Did that seem weird? 
Whicpart? 
Joey jogging like a Mexican jumping bean, or that guy talking like he had no teeth? 
No, Joey's reaction. 
I think he secretly ate my cupcakes and then lied about it. 
Chastity, what if Joey has some sort of eating disorder? 
Oh, please. 
Joey's just weird. 
You're overreacting. 
Did you see that? 
Hey, hey, Kat, have you seen Patrick Verona? 
No, why? Is that his package? 
No. 
I saw his name on it. 
Why do you have it? 
No reason. 
He's getting his mail sent to my house. 
It's supposed to be on the DL, so please don't tell him I told you, or I'll have to home school, and my mom's a drop-out. 
Why would he do this? 
Do you know what's in here? 
No, but it isn't ticking and nothing's seeping out, so it's not a bomb or a severed head. 
Something weird's going on. 
I'm worried Patrick's in real trouble. 
I wish we could just open this. 
No. You can't do that. 
Mail tampering's a felony. 
Yeah, you're right. 
A felony probably would look bad on a college app, but we could follow him. 
Follow Patrick Verona? 
No way, no how, no, ma'am. 
You've got a death wish. 
Be my guest. 
Count me out, misses. 
Okay. Then I guess I'll just 
have to ask Patrick myself what's in the package that was sent to you that nobody's supposed to know about. 
So follow him? 
Joey, Joey, he's our man. 
If he can't pose it, no one can. 
I'm Joey Donner, quarterback of the Padua High Penguins, and I'm the next Biggest Poser. 
Oh, no. Not the next biggest, 
the Biggest Poser. 
Cut. 
We've got to do it again. 
My abs still aren't popping. 
Joey, we've already done it 17 times. 
Your abs look amazing. 
But they have to be astounding, or Pixie Krotch will rip me to shreds. 
Oh, my God.  Joey doe. 
I just read this article in Cosmo Girl about eating disorders, and he's displaying all the signs. 
No, that's what I was afraid of. 
Wait, Joey's a guy. 
Guys don't get eating disorders. 
No, they do. I saw 
an episode of True Life called "I'm a dude, and I have an eating disorder." 
Ooh, that sounds good. 
Joey needs our help. 
What do we do? How do you even 
bring something like this up? 
Well, it's tricky. 
The article said he'll be full of shame. 
Have you guys ever seen Intervention? 
Here, take my car. 
Really? What's the catch? 
No catch. You're just 
a friend in need. 
Just like that? 
Just bring it back in one piece. 
Okay. 
You need a ride home? 
No, I'm good. Drive safe. 
Okay, thanks. 
You're weird when you're nice. 
Kat, Kat. 
This is your mom's car? 
Might as well follow him in a parade float. 
Well, I doubt he's expecting southern California's third highest-earning Josie May saleswoman to be hot on his tail. 
Here's your disguise. 
Here. 
Just go. 
We're going to lose him. 
I just got my license last week. 
I feel like I should warn you. 
Prepare, observe, move. 
Go! 
I'm just worried that if we have an intervention for Joey, he'll freak. 
Plus, how am I supposed to explain why you guys are there and not his football buddies? 
So invite his football buddies. 
I can't. Then he'll be 
really embarrassed. 
He'd never forgive me. 
Okay, pause for genius. 
We'll do a fake intervention for Bianca, then it'll make sense that it's only us and Joey. 
Then we'll use all of his real problems as your fake problems. 
Once he hears that you guys do all the same sick, bizarre stuff He'll totally realize he has a problem, too. 
Oh, my God. C, it's brills. 
I love this idea. 
I don't know. It seems 
a little far-fetched. 
Why would he believe it? 
Trust me. 
I've seen all 108 episodes of Intervention. 
I can coach you how to react. 
First, you need to be in denial. 
It's the most pathetic step. 
Then, you have to angrily get up and try to leave. 
The more erratic you act, the better. 
Once you sit back down, we all read our letters to you. 
We tell you how much we love you, blah blah, and how much your sickness is hurting all of us, blah blah. 
Then finally, you break down, cry, and admit that you have a problem. 
Okay. It's worth a try. 
Yay. 
I haven't had this much fun planning something since I helped Janelle plan my surprise birthday party last year. 
Okay. Patrick's just 
going to this corporate office building. 
Quick, park. 
You have to follow him. 
See where he goes. 
Me? Why me? 
Because he'll recognize me. 
You're not 6'6". 
Just park. 
Parallel park? 
Oh, gosh. 
Okay, I can do this. 
Here we go. 
1, turn indicator on. 
Check. 
2, line up rear bumpers. 
Check. 
Hurry. 
I'm doing my best. 
3... 
3, 3. 
Put car in reverse. 
Check. 
While you're busy writing checks, he just went inside. 
Should I still park? 
I feel like I should see this thing through. 
Yeah, just-- We'll wait till he comes out. 
See where he goes next. 
Okay. 4, uh... 
I miss the old Bianca, the one who didn't keep secrets from me, like the other day. 
I know you ate my carrot cake and you lied about it when I asked you. 
No, I didn't. 
I hate carrot cake. 
I'm being framed. 
Then why did you have cream cheese icing on your chin? 
This is ridiculous! 
I'm out of here. 
Don't try and stop me. 
Bianca, wait, please. 
Please sit down. 
We're only doing this because we love you. 
It's okay. 
"Dear Bianca, I love you very much, "so it pains me to say this, "but I've noticed lately "that you have been spitting out your food "instead of eating it, "and when you hurt yourself, "you hurt me, too. 
"We all look up to you. 
"When you can't see how beautiful you are, especially your abs--" It scares us. 
Oh, yeah. - Joey? 
Is there anything you want to say? 
I feel terrible. 
I had no idea you had a problem, Bianca. 
You eat all the time. 
I just thought you were one of those naturally skinny girls who'd eventually fill out as she matured. 
Not that you're not as beautiful as anything just the way you are. 
I'm just saying it's why this is such a shock. 
Oh, good, Ms. Tharp. 
I figured I'd clue in a professional, so I called the guidance counselor. 
I'm here, Bianca. 
Let me join this circle of love, okay? 
It's been almost an hour. 
What is he doing in there? 
Oh, I got to pee, I got to pee, I got to pee. 
I told you not to drink that huge soda. 
Well, that ship has sailed. 
Let me just run in real quick. 
No. What if he comes out? 
Here. If you have to 
pee so bad, use this. 
Are you kidding? 
I just started using public restrooms a year ago. 
Hi. I need 
a hydrating concealer in light beige, unless you think I need a medium beige. 
Just give us a minute, ma'am. 
Look, my mom loaned me the car. 
The least we can do is make a sale. 
Everything's in the back seat. 
Where are you going? 
Into the bushes. 
I appreciate the soda cup offer, but I want my first time exposing myself to be with someone special. 
So light or medium? 
Do you have your color wheel? 
No, but I'm thinking light beige. 
Unless I find medium first. 
Oh, my goodness. 
Your giant sales associate is urinating in the bushes. 
This is not your toilet, young man! 
He's not peeing. 
He's collecting samples for our organic line. 
Here you go. 
Free gift, new customer. 
Oh, thank you. 
Awesome. 
Do you have a card? 
Bye-bye now. 
Bye-bye. 
What? 
You followed me? 
No. 
This is just my new after-school job. 
So you're stalking me now? 
Look, we're not stalking you. 
Cameron and I just have a lot of questions. 
No, I don't have any questions, not a one. 
In fact, I have answers to homework questions. 
I'm going to go sit in the car. 
Where are you going? 
See, this is why I had to follow you, because any time anybody wants to talk to you, you just walk off. 
I was at my therapist's office. 
He's really good. 
You want his card? 
Therapist? I thought 
You thought what? 
I was going to my secret crack den so me and my baby mama could tat each other up? 
No. 
I don't know. Why are you 
seeing a therapist? 
Let's just say I'm not really having a Josie May day. 
Patrick. 
Kat, I'm going to take off. 
Can I get that visor back? 
Bianca, sweetie, how long have you been struggling with this problem? 
I don't know. 
Not that long. 
It's okay. 
You're in a safe zone. 
Thanks, but I'm kind of ashamed. 
I'd rather it just be my friends. 
Why don't you think of me as a friend who happens to have a Master's in counseling? 
Now, I've got a secret for you. 
Believe it or not, I have also had my battles with self-esteem and body issues, so I totally get where you're coming from. 
Now, I would like to introduce you to mirror work, which changed my life. 
So why don't you take a look and tell me what you see? 
Can you see how pretty you are? 
Yeah, I am really pretty. 
You can go now. 
Don't be mad at me for asking her to come, Fiver. 
I'd do anything to help you get better. 
Really? 
Well, you know what would really help? 
It would be great if you could be healthy with me. 
Oh, good idea. 
Mm-hm. 
Yes. 
I'll give up my food log if you give up yours, and I'll stop doing obsessive crunches if you will. 
Would you do that for me? 
For you? Sure. 
Bianca. 
Dad. 
Oh, Dr. Stratford, 
thank you for coming. 
I came soon as I could. 
Honey, if you have a problem, we'll deal with it. 
We'll get you counseling. 
Or Ms. Tharp says 
there's an excellent boarding school in Utah that's had amazing success stories. 
Utah? No, I don't have 
an eating disorder. 
This is what denial looks like. 
I really don't. Joey does. 
This is a fake intervention for him. 
We were afraid he'd be full of shame, so we pretended it was for me. 
Wait, Joey, I'm sorry, but I didn't know what else to do when you lied about eating those cupcakes. 
I didn't lie. 
Check my food log. 
If I'd eaten them, I would have made a notation in the bad carbs column. 
See? 
I'm eating 2,500 calories a day lean protein, whole grains, veggies, and odorless fish oil caps. 
My body fat's at 12%. 
That's as healthy as you can get. 
But what about the chicken? 
I saw you spit it out. 
And you were obsessing over your abs, even though they're better than the Situation's. 
The chicken was raw. 
And I know my abs are way better than the Situation's. 
That's why I'm always doing this. 
I admit, I got a little crazy with the video, but that's only because I really want to get on the show to launch my super-successful modeling career. 
I'm just impatient to take the world by storm. 
That's all. 
I just want you to be careful. 
So many models get too thin because of all the pressures to be modely, and I don't want that to happen to you. 
I don't want that to happen, either. 
So tell you what. 
If you see me going overboard, you pull me back to shore. 
Deal? 
Deal. 
So then who ate those frigging cupcakes? 
Look, I'm sorry. 
I shouldn't have followed you. 
At least let me give you a ride home. 
We don't even have to talk. 
Just drop me back at school. 
I can take you all the way home. 
It's no problem. 
Okay, school it is. 
So how about them Dodgers? 
I'm a Padres fan. 
See, that's something I didn't know about you. 
Sharing's fun. 
Why do you care so much? 
Because. 
Because what? 
I just care about you, okay? 
God, I'm sorry. I'll stop. 
What do you want to know? 
Why are you in therapy? 
You were right. 
The sleep eating is from stress, caused by my stepfather. 
He's a jackass. 
Thank you for telling me. 
So what's in the package? 
A Snuggie. 
Who wouldn't want a blanket with arms?

Aspiring models, please send  in your audition tapes. 
I'm Joey Donner, quarterback of the Padua High Penguins. 
"You're my best friend"? 
First, you already got a best friend. 
Raising two teenage girls by yourself It just seems really lonely. 
A, I'm not going to sleep with you until we talk about sex and its implications. 
Why do you care so much? 
I just care about you, okay? 
Been thinking about the other night. 
Yes, that kiss surprised me, too. 
Of course it was a nice surprise. 
It was like a birthday party for my lips. 
I'm just a little confused about what it meant. 
Maybe we could get together to repeat it-- Discuss it. 
I don't know, Saturday night? 
Great. 
Uh, yes, ma'am, I'm looking forward to performing your C-section on Saturday. Bye. 
Bianca, hi. 
I was updating my dream book, and I realized on my list of short-term dreams, I've already accomplished the first three pages. 
I'm a cheerleader, I'm popular, and I have a gorgeous boyfriend. 
Now to tackle my next page Hosting a Martha Stewart-worthy fancy dinner party. 
Can I do it on Saturday? 
Saturday? 
It just sounds like an awful lot of work to do in two days. 
And remember, Martha Stewart has an entire staff, and a work ethic honed in the cold reality of a penitentiary. 
Please, Daddy? 
I'll take care of everything. 
Please help my page 4 come true. 
I'm supposed to deliver babies. 
I'll cancel. 
I'll make my lasagna. 
Oh, Daddy. 
It's an adult dinner party, so there can't be any grown-ups. 
Kat will chaperone. 
She's practically elderly, and that way you can still facilitate the miracle of life. 
All right. 
I mean-- All right, you know, everybody wins. 
Where is your sister, anyway? 
 Patrick, let's... 
 Yeah? Get tested. 
Not exactly what I thought you were going to say, but sure. 
I'll make the appointment. 
You're a take-charge girl. 
I like that about you. 
English Version By YesCool Our appointment's after school at 3:15. 
The results take an hour. 
Have you given any thought to when and where we should consummate? 
I was thinking 4:15, alley behind the testing center. 
Great. I'll meet you 
in the dumpster. 
Saturday night. 
And don't worry, it ain't going to be in a dumpster. 
Oh, Kat, I forgot to tell you, you're chaperoning my dinner party Saturday night. 
I've rented you an assortment of political documentaries, so you can stay in your room and be outraged. 
Sounds fun, but I have plans. 
Even better. Just tell Dad 
you're chaperoning. 
What are you doing? 
Something really boring that would be of no interest to you. 
 Dawn, come on. 
 Okay, bye. 
Okay, bye. 
Michael, I have a girlfriend. 
Girlfriend. I have a girlfriend. 
And she's so hot. 
I know. I just wish i heard from you 
instead of from graffiti on the bathroom wall. 
Really? What does it say? 
"Cameron James is dating way out of his league." 
At least it doesn't say "Spoink is dating way out of his league." 
Mike, I'm sorry. 
What are you doing Saturday night? 
You want to play video games till we're nauseous? 
Sure, sure, but there is something that I should tell you  before we hang out. 
 What? 
I... 
I just became a level 8 ogre slayer in Ogre Slayer. 
Oh! I pay liege to you, 
menace to the ogre world. 
Oh, yeah. 
Okay, Cameron and Dawn are coming. 
This is my chance to show I'm cool with it, and I also invited Chastity because, well... 
 If you don't, she'll kill you. 
 - Pretty much. 
I have no idea who she's bringing. 
I just hope he has manners. 
This party is supposed to be classy. 
  It's from my mom. 
Oh, my God. 
The Biggest Poser called. 
I have an audition this afternoon. 
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! 
I know. 
Will you come with me? 
You make me feel so confident, and when I look into your eyes, I can see how good-looking I am. 
Oh, of course I will. 
Wow, Joey, all our dreams really are coming true. 
This music is making me hot. 
Maybe they sell the CD. 
Hey. Curiosity killed the cat. 
Yeah. Well, 
better that than an STD. 
Seriously, how many girls have you slept with? 
Oh, let's see. 
Uh, ski trip, summer camp... 
 Oh, babysitter. Carry the one. 311. 
 Darn. I've only slept with 300. 
I'll have to catch up. 
 You, cowboy. You're next. 
 Giddyup. 
Hey, we need to talk. 
I need a favor. 
I haven't made Dawn break up with you. 
Favor granted. 
Look, I made plans with Dawn and my friend Michael. 
For the first time in my life, I'm double-booked on a Saturday night. 
Having a girlfriend is so much more complicated than I thought. 
Would you please bring Michael as your date to Bianca's dinner party? 
Ugh, no. I'd rather 
go with a hand puppet. 
Why would you even suggest that? 
Chastity, Michael's whole dream in life is to be popular. 
Think what would happen if he went with the most popular girl in school, what that would do for him. 
It'd be like he's a book, and you're Oprah's seal of approval. 
You're that powerful. 
He'd be like my own little version of that school in South Africa. 
Yeah. 
But tell him to meet me outside Bianca's house because I do not want him to know where I live. 
If I don't sit Cameron and Dawn next to each other, they'll think I'm not okay with them being a couple, but if I do, then there's that awkward height differential, which is not elegant. 
But friendship comes first. 
How do celebrities and In Style do this? 
 Joey, help me. 
 Babe, I'm minutes away from the most important five minutes of my life. 
I got to stretch my face. 
I'm sorry. 
You're totally right. 
You stay focused. 
 Joey Donner. 
 That's me. 
Remember, you're beautiful inside and out. 
Rock it. 
Is he your boyfriend? 
He's so hot. He's totally 
going to make the show. 
I hope so. 
You play your cards right, you'll get a ton of screen time. 
the one where I slept with him in the same room as five other people and the one where he dumped me. 
God, I'm so sorry. 
That's what I get for dating a reality star. 
They either dump you or cheat on you. 
But it's cool. I had 
a great crying scene. 
I'm very proud of it. 
Erin Schiff. 
Yes? 
We're putting you in the shot. 
Do you have on a bikini? 
Natch. 
Oil them up. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? 
Your boyfriend's been in there a really long time. 
You do know where we are, right? 
All clear. 
What took you so long? 
I got my results 20 minutes ago. 
Sorry. The nurse made me 
put a condom on a banana. 
 It's harder than it looks. 
 Why? Were you nervous? 
 No, I'm just sick of this Muzak. 
 Can we go? Yep, we can go. 
All the way home. 
Do you like my dress? 
Do I look okay? 
God, I'm so nervous. 
It's just a dinner party for a bunch of high school nimrods. 
You don't understand. 
Next week, Joey could be in a New York penthouse with 11 gorgeous, hungry, insecure models and a hot tub. 
I need to be memorable so he doesn't dump me on national television. 
Think you're going to achieve all that with one dress? 
You're right. 
I should sleep with him. 
Great idea. 
Just be sure to get pregnant. 
Then he'll never forget you because he'll be paying child support. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
Matching underwear and you shaved your legs? 
You're having sex with Patrick Verona tonight. 
I am not. 
Oh, my God. 
You're such a hypocrite. 
If you can have sex, why can't I? 
Because I'm mature, and you're a 15-year-old idiot. 
I forbid you. 
You can't forbid me to do anything. 
Besides, I know you were my age when you slept with Josh. 
Your journal fell open into my lap. 
Well, did you read the part where the next day, we moved here and he never called me again? 
No. 
After we moved, you started hiding your journal. 
So much for our long-distance relationship. 
Two days later, he posted pics of himself on Facebook kissing Hannah. 
 Gross. We hate Josh. 
 It was devastating. 
And as much as I hate you, I don't want to see you making the same mistake. 
Why is it any different this time with Patrick? 
Because mature people realize that sex is not love. 
We got tested. We're not 
seeing other people. 
It's no big deal. 
Wow. That sounds like 
a wonderful transaction. 
 Joey, how do I look? 
 Great, hon. 
I'm trying to find the spot in your house with the best reception. 
The Biggest Poser people are calling tonight, and I can't miss it. 
Welcome. Thank you for coming 
to my dinner party. 
Wow, Bianca, this is so elegant and sophisticated. 
Yeah? I really wanted it 
to be fancy and classy. 
We brought you some Sparkling Cider. 
Oh, that's lovely. 
Please come in and help yourself to some hors d'oeuvres. 
Oh, man, shrimp! 
Seriously? 
We're going to do it in the back of Keith's van? 
This isn't much better than a dumpster. 
You sure about that? 
How did you See? 
Okay, here the the ground rules. 
You are not to look me directly in the eye. 
If you tell people that we had any type of physical contact, I will sever something important. 
Capisce? 
Trust me, there is a 0.0% chance 
of that happening. 
What, am I not your type? 
Because your type is anything with a pulse. 
No, what I meant was that Was what? 
This had better be good because right now I'm insulted and you do not want to insult me. 
No, I wouldn't hook up with you because I'm gay. 
You're gay? 
Yes, yes, but I've only been out for three days. 
Benji says I'm a new-born. 
Please don't say anything, okay? 
I still haven't got up the nerve to tell Cameron yet. 
Don't worry. 
I can keep a secret. 
 He's gay? 
 Gay? 
Gay, gay... 
But Cameron doesn't know, and I promised Michael I wouldn't tell anybody, so you can't go blabbing it around, okay? Sh. 
Trust me, I won't. 
The last thing I want is coming out drama at my sophisticated party. 
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but you and Chastity look kind of cute together, like the elephant that made friends with the dog. 
Yeah, she's not really my type. 
 Well, you never know. 
 I know. 
I guess I'm just concerned about the age difference. 
You're very young, and I'm very Older. 
And I'm the girls' guidance counselor. 
If I'm romantically involved with their father, and I advise them to go to college out of state, they could misconstrue my intentions. 
Plus, you might want to have children. 
And you don't like mushrooms, and I love mushrooms. 
That doesn't really seem like a deal-breaker. 
Oh, my God, I'm doing exactly what Dr. Frumowitz says. 
I'm keeping you at arm's length because of my abandonment issues and fear of intimacy, and you're doing the exact same thing. 
We're mirroring and projecting and future tripping. 
Okay, I was with you all the way until future tripping. 
I think we should give it a shot. 
I do, too. 
And then I posed like this. 
And then I threw in a few eyewear poses that I think blew their minds. 
He's so good. 
I have to get my grandmother's serving dish. 
Will you please keep an eye on the meat? 
And try to get Dawn off Cameron's lap. 
It's not elegant. 
No problem, Five-o. 
So than,  i took-off my--. 
 or... it's could 
to been good model. 
Hey, you know who'd make a good model? 
You, my tall drink of water. 
Dawn, Dawn... 
Oh, sweetie, I know that this must be so hard for you, watching your straight best friend kiss a girl, knowing that that will never be you. 
 So sorry. 
 Oh, Dawn. 
Did Joey check the meat? Where is he? 
Oh, no. 
I'm on The Biggest Poser. 
I leave for New York tomorrow! 
You know how long I've wanted to do this? 
Since that first day I saw you at school. 
You mean that creepy stare-off? 
It wasn't creepy, it was sexy. 
Don't forget who won that stare-off, buddy. 
Me. 
I let you win. 
I only walked away because I knew  it would drive you nuts.  Don't flatter  
yourself. - I knew I'd get you eventually. 
 You'd get me?  Well, I'm about to, aren't I? 
 Is that what this is? 
Your master plan to get me to sleep with you? 
 I'm just some sex object? 
 No. 
You talk way too much to be just a sex object. 
Oh, come on. 
What just happened? 
Weren't we having fun? 
I'm sorry, did you want me to answer? 
I thought I talked too much. 
You're overreacting. You're right. 
I should just be happy to be girl #312. 
Is that what this is about? 
You know I haven't slept with that many girls. 
I'm in high school, not the NBA. 
Do you bring them in here, too? 
Do you and Keith run a little brothel on wheels? 
Yeah, but don't worry... 
The first one's free. 
Why are you freaking out? 
I thought we both wanted to do this. 
Just because I want to have sex doesn't mean I should. 
God, I've been fooled by guys like you before, but not this time. 
 Take me home.  
 With pleasure. 
I'll tell you one thing I am not going to be the guy who's not there to make friends. 
I want to make friends, and then beat them. 
Okay, everybody. 
Now it's time for a toast to Joey's new life. 
I'm so happy all your dreams are coming true. 
Should we leave, or stick around for dessert? 
I don't know. 
She made this yummy cheesecake. 
I was really looking forward to it. 
Cameron, I'm gay. 
I am so glad I came tonight. 
Hey, what's the matter? 
Joey, I don't want you to think that I'm not happy for you, because I am. 
Your abs are going to be on national television. 
I'm just... 
I'm worried everything's going to change. 
Five-o, the only thing the show's going to change is my address and hair color, not the way I feel about you. 
I love you, Bianca, whether I'm in San Diego, New York, or Japan. 
Apparently, they go cuckoo for blonds in Japan. 
Wait, did you just say that you love me? 
Duh. 
My God, I love you, too. 
This is the best dinner party ever. JOEY Yea! 
Hey, bud. You okay? 
Michael, just give me a minute. 
I need a chance to process this. 
I know. It's a shock. 
Well, I guess thinking back, the signs were there, like that day in kindergarten when I first saw you run. 
Uh, excuse you, I have a very masculine gait. 
You were chasing the girl who stole your My Little Pony. 
Ah, Starsong. I miss her. 
So are you weirded out? 
No, no, no. I could not be 
more down with the gays. 
If my parents die, I'm moving to Palm Springs to live with my gay uncle. 
He throws these awesome game nights. 
Okay, okay, because there is one more thing that I need to tell you. 
You have a crush on me? 
'Cause that's cool. 
No, no. I'm not 
a level 8 ogre slayer. 
You thought I had a crush on you? 
Well... 
 Joey, on the other hand... 
 I keep losing out to that guy. 
but it's okay because he told me he loves me. 
That's great. You didn't even 
have to sleep with him. 
 So how was sexy time? 
 Didn't happen. 
We had a huge fight. 
I think it's over. 
Oh, God. Kat, I'm so sorry. 
Are you okay? 
I'm fine. 
Right. 
Ooh, meaningful eye contact with Beau Brody. 
 God, he's so cute. 
 He is a God... 
but that was hardly meaningful. 
It wasn't even a two-second hold. 
Well, maybe he's just shy. Ooh, 
what if he asks you to fall fling? 
Dawn, Beau Brody is the captain of the soccer team. 
A guy that far from the food chain would never ask me. 
I wear a penguin hat. 
Okay, don't look, but he is looking over here again. 
Okay, don't look! Ooh, 
what if Beau is asking Joey Donner... 
if he and Chastity want to double date with you and Beau? 
God, you two would make the cutest couple. 
Hey, five-head. 
That was my swimwear walk. 
I don't think it works with jeans. 
 No, it does. 
 Thanks. So, listen... 
you want to go to fall fling with my friend Beau over there? 
 Why? Does he want to go with me? 
 Yeah, but he wants me to ask you. 
He says he gets shy around pretty girls. 
Shut up. 
He said that out loud? 
I told you. I swear to God, 
sometimes I think I'm psychic. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Okay, bye. 
 No. No way. 
 Please. This is momentous. 
This is a milestone moment in my young life. 
My chance to finally have my first date, and not just any date... 
but a date to the most important dance of the fall with the cutest boy at school. 
I thought you said Joey Donner was the cutest. 
Who's not taken. I've had a crush 
on Beau Brody all week long. 
Ooh. 
Have you picked out invitations? 
Kat, I'm begging you. 
I think Beau and I could be soul mates... 
like you and Patrick Verona. 
Wow. You realize 
this isn't sweet valley high, right? 
You leave me no choice. 
 Patrick? 
 Don't you dare. 
Please take my sister to fall fling. 
Excuse her. She was dropped 
on her head as an infant. 
Now she has these episodes. 
Let's get you medicated. 
Look, deep, deep down beneath my sister's crusty exoskeleton... 
 she has a soft spot for you. 
 I'm going to kill you in your sleep. 
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate. 
My father is a freak who won't let me date until she does... 
so will you please take her to the dance? 
You can consider it a charitable contribution to the free Bianca Stratford foundation. 
Okay, I'll do it. 
 What? 
 What? 
I'll take her to that dance. 
Even if you are serious, what makes you think I'd go? 
Don't ask questions. 
Just say yes. 
I am serious. I'd like to see 
how you look in a dress. 
I'll pick you up at 7:00. 
 We both have dates to the dance. 
 Sleep with one eye open. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: I'm bummed. Chastity and I aren't going to the 
dance 'cause she's getting her gums scraped. 
Uh-huh. 
So tell me more about Bianca. 
Oh, she's really cool. She's great at chemistry, 
and she's got this really great face. 
It's- it's symmetrical but not too symmetrical 'cause that could get boring. 
Right. So she bought all that stuff 
about me being shy around pretty girls? 
Why wouldn't she buy it? 
It's true, right? 
Dude, I'm the David Beckham of Padua High. 
I don't need to be shy, but girls dig it. 
It's nonthreatening. 
Not cool, Beau. 
Because of you, I lied to her. 
 Hey, man, I'm sorry  She's a nice girl. 
You better treat her right or-- or I'll treat you wrong. 
Jeez. Touchy, touchy. 
Yeah, she can't be that sweet. 
After all, she did sleep with Mr. Ross. 
I plan on treating her right. 
You're talking to Beau. 
Ah, thanks for getting back to me. 
Can I book a room for Saturday night? 
Two people. 
No, no, no, no. One bed. 
I mean, what do you really know about this Beau guy? 
He's cute, and he has the best smile, and... 
if I tell you something, do you swear to never repeat it to anyone? 
Sure. 
This is going to be my first date ever. 
 This is your first date? 
 Shh. Not so loud. 
I don't want anybody to think I'm Amish. 
But, Bianca, your first date should be special... 
with someone who cares about you and respects you. 
How much more special can you get than to go with the super-hot captain... 
 of the soccer team? 
 But are are his intentions honorable? 
We're going to a high school dance, not colonial Williamsburg. 
I don't know. I just have 
a bad feeling about him. 
I know. Why don't you cancel, 
and we can go together? 
Oh, you don't have a date. 
Well, that's okay. 
You can go with another friend Someone like, um, Benji! 
Hey. 
Bye, Cameron. 
It's not see-through. 
That's good. 
Three inches above the knee. 
Denied. 
But, daddy, this is the sixth dress you've rejected. 
Why don't you wear that nice one you wore to last year's school play? 
It was my costume. 
I was playing Helen Keller. 
It was very flattering. 
Even she could have seen that. 
Hi, daddy. 
Kat, I'll need to approve your outfit as well. 
 I'm going in this. 
 Approved. 
You can't wear that to the dance. 
Patrick said he wants to see you in a dress. 
 So I should give my date everything he wants. 
 Give your date nothing he wants. 
Come with me. 
I'll get you fixed up. 
 I don't need your help. 
 You're right. What you need... 
is a team of professional stylists, but I'm what you got. 
Patrick is going to love me. 
 Bianca, that dress is still too short! 
 I'll slouch! 
Here we go. 
 Uhuh. This is scary. 
 Don't blink. 
Trust me, this dress will not look good with an eye patch. 
Why do women do this? 
Do men say, "Oh, gosh, you know, she'd be perfect... 
if only she had black crap all over her eyelashes"? 
I finally get to make you over, and you're sucking all the joy out of it. 
Sorry. 
Wow. I've been tuning 
you out for so long... 
I never realized you're actually pretty. 
Oh, my God, I look like a princess. 
This is my first date, and I'm so excited, I think I might pee in my pants. 
Please don't. 
These shoes are open toe... 
and unlike you, I actually have realistic expectations. 
 These things are never fun. 
 How would you know? 
You've never been to one. 
It's Patrick. 
He's here. 
Wait till he sees you looking like that. 
He is going to die. 
Not if I die first. 
 I should go save him from dad. 
 No, wait. 
You have to wait for your descent. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Your descent down the stairs. 
There's one in every great movie, like she's all that, the classic film... 
about the pretty-ugly girl who becomes pretty. 
Coincidence? 
I think not. 
You realize you're not actually living in a teen movie, right? 
Be sure to go so slowly... 
it looks like you're moving in slow motion. 
That will give him time to realize he's falling in love. 
Seriously, read a newspaper. 
Wait. 
Take this lip gloss just in case he gets past your defenses. 
This is the baby crowning. 
Oh, this is what placenta looks like. 
Here's the father cutting the cord. 
Of course, that's only symbolic... 
because he's responsible for that baby for the rest of his life. 
Got it. 
Sex makes babies. 
Are you done with your inquisition, dad? 
We have a stupid teen clich� to be at. 
I was just showing your friend with the disturbingly deep voice... 
who looks much older than 17 what could happen if he's not careful... 
and by "careful," I don't mean, use a condom. 
I mean, keep it in your pants. 
Dad, I'll be home by curfew. 
I'm so sorry. 
His tourette's is acting up. 
Okay, he just really cares about you. 
Plus it's funny how fast he turns red. 
It is, isn't it? 
We taking my bike? 
Please tell me he's talking about his 10-speed. 
We're taking my car. 
Don't worry. 
I have my stun gun. 
Kat. 
 Seat belts? 
 Yes. 
* Don't you don't you wanna, wanna * * Don't you * * Don't you wanna see me flaunt what I've got * * Don't you don't you wanna, wanna * * Don't you * * Don't you wanna see me flaunt what I've got * * Baby * * Come a little closer * * Come and get to know me * * And what I've got * Cameron, he stood me up. 
* Would you come and save me? * 
* Would you come and be with me * * And see what I've got * I didn't get to show off this dress. 
I didn't get to slow dance. 
I didn't get my first kiss. 
Beau is such a jerk! 
He's king of the jerks. 
He rules jerklandia. 
Well, just because he ruined your date doesn't mean he should ruin your evening. 
He also ruined my Monday, when I have to face everyone at school. 
Bianca, this is crazy. 
Let's go to the dance. 
But this pity party's just getting started. 
The deejay's going to spin some serious Kelly Clarkson. 
Fine. Your loss. 
But if we don't go to the dance, you'll never get to see my sick moves. 
 You have sick moves? 
 Are you kidding? 
I'm the conductor of the hot tamale train. 
I'm sorry, Cameron, I just... 
don't think I could do it. 
If we go to the dance... 
all they'll be talking about Monday is how beautiful you are. 
* Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * * Turn it up and let loose * Wow. And I thought 
school was bad in the daytime. 
What do you think will happen first, a conga line or the electric slide? 
Pretty sure I feel the "macarena"coming on. 
No "macarena". 
Darn. 
Well, that's all right. 
This is just as awkward. 
I'd hardly call this dancing. 
These kids are just dry-humping to music. 
In that case, care to dance? 
No way. 
Oh, I see. 
You can't dance. 
 Oh, I can dance. 
 Yeah? Prove it. 
* That you can care for someone so * * You hold on tight just to let go * Oh, I'm sorry. 
I'll try to let you lead. 
Oh, this I got to see. 
* Just let me be * * To walk alone on empty streets * Wow, I can almost forget I ate lunch here yesterday. 
 There will be other first dates. 
 You're right. 
Thanks for being so sweet. 
I love this song. 
Do you want to dance? 
Thank God you're here. 
I'm kind of on the fence about Eric. 
Do you think eyeliner is sexy or just weird? 
Yeah, I think so, too. 
Uh, so where's Beau? 
 He stood me up. 
 Oh, my God, we hate him. 
 Tell me everything. 
 No, wait... 
 Hey, string bean. 
 Hey, Benji. 
* I found out that nothing could please * Wow. I think this is the longest 
I've ever seen you quiet. 
Ah, and there goes a nice moment. 
All right! Yeah! 
Whoo! 
 Yeah, I can't do this. 
 Me either. You want to get some punch? 
 Did you really just say that? 
 Yeah, I did. 
Okay. 
Time for my sick moves. 
You ready? 
Oh-oh-oh, yeah. 
This is called the roller coaster. 
That is sick. 
Or perhaps you prefer to dance with an Egyptian. 
I'll be your Cleopatra. 
*Hey I've got the frequency to turn you on *  Why you got to be like that, baby? 
 Don't call me baby. I don't like it. 
You are my baby, and I need babies to get strong. 
Babies are smarter than me. 
Want to make out? 
So, listen, I never thanked you for the other night... 
during the fire. 
Yeah, that kiss was pretty good, right? 
No. For rescuing 
my mom's records. 
Maybe you weren't raised by wolves. 
 Was that almost a compliment? 
 Almost. 
* I've got the frequency to turn you on * Come on. 
Let's get out of here. 
 And go where? 
 Anywhere. The beach. 
That's exactly what this dress is missing-- Tenth. 
I'll give you a piggyback ride. 
Oh, don't be scared. I'm not 
going to try and kiss you again... 
not even if you beg me. 
Don't hold your breath. 
Meet me downstairs. 
I've got to take a leak. 
Good to know. 
 By the way, I was right. 
 About what? 
About how good you'd look in a dress. 
* I've got the frequency to turn you on, hey * * Something you done to keep it on, hey * * Hey * Step, step, step, cha! 
Step, step, step, cha! 
This is so cheesy and so much fun. 
* If we could live in this moment * * Then you would know * * That every line I ever said was meant to grow * * I traded all of my chances * * And now I see *  Up close, you're really tall. 
 Yup. 
 Up close, your hair smells nice. 
 Really? 
It's this new shampoo. 
It has jojoba oil in it. 
Oh, wow. 
Cameron, thanks for making me come. 
You... saved my night. 
I'm always here for you. 
* After all this time * * Now that I * * Have finally found me * Bianca, there you are. 
I am so sorry. 
* Now the sun is shin... * 
You'll never guess what happened. 
Look, I know you're mad. 
This is me annoyed. 
You don't want to see me mad. 
I would have been there at 7:00, but some stupid kids let the air out of all my tires. 
 You could have called. 
 I can't find my phone. 
 I've looked everywhere. 
 You couldn't find another phone? 
I didn't have her number, not like it's any of your business. 
Don't you dare talk to him like that. 
While you were out thinking up lame excuses, he was there for me. 
 That's my phone. 
 I think it's echoing off the walls. 
 It could be anywhere. 
 No, it's close. 
 Just... 
 Cameron. 
Dude, you stole my phone? 
Why would I do that? 
I already have a phone, Beau. 
It must've fallen in there. 
Wait here. 
Cameron, what's going on? 
I overheard him talking in the locker room. 
He was planning on taking you to a hotel room. 
So you deflate his tires and steal his phone? 
Sounds a little crazy when you say it like that... 
 but I did it to protect you, Bianca. 
 Protect me? 
You ruined my first date, and I can never have a first date again. 
No, listen. 
You can't trust him. 
Can't trust him? I can't trust you. 
I thought we were friends. 
 We are friends, but I have  Just stay out of my life, Cameron. 
Let's go. 
Bianca! 
Whoa-ho! 
I'm so trashed, for a second I thought you were Patrick Verona. 
It's me, Keith. 
Nice try. 
You wouldn't come to a dance... 
unless you're a narc. 
Is this a bust? 
I'm not a narc. I'm here on a date. 
Do you mind? 
No, actually, I'm glad you're here. 
I feel way less lame now. 
You want some? It's medical. 
I have early stage glaucoma. 
I told you I smelled something illegal. 
* It's getting much too easy to resist you * Whoo-hoo! 
Yeah! 
* And when you're gone, it's hard to listen * * All the tears I ever cried * * All the lies you'd love to try * * Everything's been said and done * * You're out again I hope you're having fun * * Baby * * 'Cause I ain't having none * * Not gonna be your plaything anymore *  So, where do you want to go? 
 I don't care. Just drive. 
I do have that hotel room. 
 Take me home. 
 Okay. 
 Are you up? 
 Yeah. 
I had the worst first date ever. 
Boys are vicious, cruel creatures. 
Remember that the next time you watch she's all that. 
 Why aren't you with Patrick? 
 Who knows? 
You'd have to ask him. 
I saw you guys dancing with my own two eyes unless I need glasses. 
No, I could get sexy, smart ones like Tina Fey. 
 Are we seriously talking about eyewear? 
 I'm sorry. Not important. 
Let's talk about Patrick. 
What happened? 
I don't want to talk about it. 
Got it. 
I can tell you about my disaster of an evening. 
I don't want you to talk either. 
Fine. 
You know, dad warns us every day about getting pregnant. 
You're lucky. 
He warns me twice a day. 
Yeah, well, he never mentions all the other ways a guy can screw you. 
Amen, sister. 
I don't want to go in there. 
What are you talking about? 
You love it in there. 
Hey, free the naked mole rats. 
Ripping. 
I was the "girl gone wild" this past weekend. 
All you did was throw an awesome pretty. 
If I tell you something, do you promise not to be judgy? 
Thanks for the buzz! 
Whoo! 
Apparently I shaved that guy's head, so I'm in no position to be judgy. 
After Chastity left, Joey and I... 
kind of made out for, like, two seconds. 
 Way to go, Sienna Miller. 
 Judgy. 
This is why I don't want to go in there. 
The guilt is killing me. What do I do? 
Either live with the guilt or tell Chastity. 
I would, but I prefer to keep my intestines inside my body. 
Ugh! At least you know 
what to feel guilty about. 
Five-head! 
It's me, Joey. 
Just pretend I'm a guy reading the newspaper. 
I don't want Chastity to see us talking. 
It's okay. She doesn't know 
anything happened between us. 
And she never will once we get our stories straight. 
That is our story. 
Nothing happened. 
Oh, gotcha. 
Bianca. 
Good news, baby. 
The war in "Azerbijackistan" is over. 
Okay, his behavior's becoming so erratic. 
He's like my grandma before we put her on meds. 
Seemed fine to me. 
Whatever. I'm not here for that. 
I'm here to spread joy. 
You know how I've been dying to make you a cheerleader for months? 
Oh-- No. 
Of course I have. 
You're my best friend. 
Anyway, Janelle has mono so bad she has to eat through a tube. 
Oh, my God. 
Is she going to be okay? 
She'll be fine. It's her own fault. 
She'll kiss anything. 
And this comes on the heels of that fainting spell... 
and her stupid Achilles, and I am done. 
This is cheerleading, not Grey's Anatomy. 
 You're taking her spot. 
 I'm a cheerleader? 
Yay! I love it 
when dreams come true. 
Here, try to sound sincere when you sign her "get well" card. 
Just so you know, I was really drunk Saturday night, like Mel Gibson drunk. 
You don't remember what you said, do you? 
I'm like one of those soap opera actors with amnesia. 
Whatever I said, I was joking. 
Oh, trust me, you were dead serious. 
 Please, just tell me. 
 Nah, I want to save this. 
People, just think of this as airport security. 
Only instead of going to Hawaii so you can sip on mai tais... 
you're going to school so you can drink up a little bit of knowledge. 
Excuse me, little lady. I'm going 
to have to inspect this carry-on here. 
 You have no right to do that. 
 Oh, I do now. Bam! 
School board enacted it's own little Patriot Act last night... 
and I am the new Dick Cheney. 
Uh-oh. I'm going 
to have to confiscate this. 
Well, Dick, you better pray I don't get cramps. 
Got my eye on you. 
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: "End fascism now"? 
Is this because I blocked Showtime? 
You don't need to make a poster. 
 We can just talk about it. 
 No. 
The administration has instituted these completely unconstitutional new rules. 
Look at these. 
It's like going to high school in Cuba. 
More than 10 students need permission to assemble. 
School has the right to search lockers. 
No drugs or weapons. 
Oh, my God! Do you mean to tell me the students 
have to leave their Uzis and heroin at home? 
 Dad, this isn't a joke. 
 How about knives and crack? 
They're trampling our civil rights. 
This time they've gone too far. 
Even the mindless mouth-breathers at Padua High will be marching to the tune of justice. 
Why do I get the feeling this isn't going to end well? 
Daddy, look. 
My little cheerleader! 
Did you ever think today would come? 
Finally, one of your daughters makes something of herself. 
I'm never taking this off. 
Sounds like someone hasn't read the new security policy. 
Are you going on about Cuba again? 
 to that. 
Ah. 
They're making us wear uniforms. 
What? No! 
No, no! I finally clawed 
my way to the top... 
so that I could have the honor of wearing this cute little outfit to school. 
They can't take that away from me! 
This is inhumane. 
I can't believe she thinks it's okay to say these things out loud. 
Well, it is her First Amendment right. 
Funny. 
Ugh! I can't believe 
this is happening to me. 
These uniforms-- I know. How are we supposed 
to express ourselves through fashion? 
No, Joey and I broke up. 
You did? 
 Why? 
 Guys are such pigs. 
Did he tell you he was studying for trig when he was really studying Kelly Morris? 
Do you think he would cheat on this test? 
 No. 
 Uhuh. 
Never. Not even if it 
were multiple choice. 
But why did you guys break up? 
Well, you know that college boy that was hitting on me at your party? 
 Who could blame him? 
 I know. 
Well, then, Joey turned into this possessive freak. 
I thought actors were bad, but models are so much worse. 
So I couldn't lose. 
Oh. When I told him, 
he started sobbing. 
I hate it when guys cry. 
It's like Fine. Be sensitive, but don't, 
like, slobber all over me. 
I'm the one that wants to cry. 
I finally get back into circulation... 
and now I have to wear this stupid uniform. 
Amen. 
 It's unAmerican. 
 Mmhmm. 
These are our civil rights, people. 
Yes, you, too. 
You, too. 
Throwing another party? 
Woman, you are an animal! 
We have to ban together and fight. 
 Who we gonna save? 
 Naked mole rats! 
Screw the stupid mole rats! 
This is about our freedom! 
I don't think half these kids can spell "freedom". 
 Wanna help hand out flyers? 
 Yeah No. 
But I was thinking after school we could head to the beach. 
At your party, you said you wanted to go. 
 I did? 
 No. 
Can you please just hand these out in auto shop? 
I'll put them on the table, but I'm not passing them out. 
 Gee, thanks. That's so supportive. 
 This is your thing, not mine. 
So you don't give a damn that we no longer have the rights... 
that are guaranteed to us in the Bill of Rights? 
Must be nice not to care about anything. 
Well, what's the point? 
It's not like we can change it. 
I'll tell you what. Come to the beach, 
and I'll tell you what you said. 
What's the point? 
It's not like I can change it. 
Cameron, we have to talk. 
I love you, but you don't feel the same way. 
 What more is there to say? 
 Cameron, wait. 
I'm so sorry. The last thing 
I'd ever want to do is hurt you. 
You're my best friend. 
You're smart and funny... 
and you're the only person who knows I like to watch 60 Minutes. 
And I miss you... 
so much. 
I miss you more. 
Do you think we could go back to being friends? 
I don't know. 
I guess we could try. 
Yay! So I'll see you 
at French tutoring. 
Au revoir, mon ami. 
"You're my best friend"? 
First, you already got a best friend. 
And second, she's just not that into you. 
Hey, she's still transitioning into seeing me as a viable heterosexual. 
Are you hearing the words that are coming out of your mouth? 
Despite everything, I still feel that Bianca and I are meant to be together. 
Haven't you ever known something deep in your heart? 
I'm 15. 
I know things deep in my pants. 
That's why I don't waste my time on chicks that aren't into me. 
Michael, a foundation of friendship is the best gift you can give a relationship. 
See? This is what happens when 
you don't have a strong father figure. 
I did not approve this flyer, Kat. 
Although I love your font choice. 
The only approval I need is the First Amendment. 
 In fact, I  Yeah, yeah. Kumbaya. 
 Just don't do it again. 
 I will do it again. 
And again and again until you change this policy. 
I'm an Energizer Bunny for liberty. 
Do you think I like this? 
Look at all this new paperwork. 
Duplicates, triplicates, quad I'm so swamped, I had to cancel my foot massage... 
which I depend on to keep me from screaming at you people... 
to leave me the hell alone! 
Then lift the policy. 
You can make all of this go away. 
I'm just a cog in the machine... 
a tool of the man. 
Hey, I think that's my ibuprofen. 
The bottom line is... 
the superintendent enacted this. 
We follow it, or we don't get funding, and I get fired. So we're both stuck. 
Unless you can convince her to change it. 
"Her"? I thought 
the superintendent is a man. 
He is. I was talking about 
his daughter, Chastity. 
And what Chastity wants, Chastity gets. 
 Yes, but Chastity hates me. 
 Oh, no. 
This revolution stuff is hard. 
Waah! 
There's Joey. Hope he doesn't do 
that sobbing thing again. 
 Hey, fivehead, can we talk? 
 Bye. 
So I heard you and Chastity broke up. 
Are you okay? 
I'm more than okay. 
I'm the maximum okayness there is. 
In fact, you wanna go out on Saturday? 
You, me, out, together. 
Yummy. Dinner. 
I'm buying. 
Joey, I would love to go out with you. 
But it's too soon. 
You and Chastity just broke up. 
We shouldn't even be seen talking together. 
Hey, she broke up with me. 
I don't even know if she ever loved me. 
Not the real me. 
I was just this gorgeous status accessory, like Paris Hilton's poodle. 
Girls like Chastity don't like other girls playing with their poodles... 
even if they've given their poodles away. 
And Chastity can be really mean. 
That's why I'm ready to be with someone really sweet, like you. 
Take you, for example. 
No. I can't do this. 
I just became a cheerleader. 
Yeah, I mean I just got tired of him. 
Sure, he's good-looking and all, but I've got that covered. 
 Chastity, can we talk? 
 Nope. 
It's first period. I only deal 
with unpleasant things after third. 
I'm on a mission of peace. 
I need your help. 
I know you do, but I only give one makeover a year... 
and I already helped Tori. 
Mmm! Boy, was that hard. 
This is important. 
Doesn't it bother you that we're all being treated like suspected criminals? 
Hmm. 
No, not really. 
Fine. Doesn't it bother you that 
you have to wear that outfit again? 
Oh, that bothers me so much. 
We should do something about it. 
Can you get me a meeting with your dad? 
It's pointless. 
I already asked him, and he said no. 
I even cried real tears. 
Then we'll stage a walkout. 
We'll refuse to go back inside until they lift the regulations. 
It'll work if the whole school does it. 
And the only person who can get the whole school to do something is you. 
That's true. 
But it all sounds really exhausting. 
Free these kids from their uniforms, and you'll be a legend. 
I'm thinking fourth period. 
Great idea. 
 Great idea. 
 Thanks. 
Everyone, can I have your attention? 
Shh! 
Guys, this is a walkout, not recess. 
Shh! Shh. 
Guys, come on! 
Be quiet, please! 
Shut up and listen to her! 
We are here today because our Constitutional rights... 
do not start the day we graduate from this hellhole. 
We deserve dignity and respect now. 
After all, we're not just stupid teenagers. 
We are citizens of the United States of America. 
When I say "uniforms", you say "suck"! 
 Uniforms! 
 Suck! 
Infringement on civil liberties! 
 Huh? 
 What? 
Suck! 
Don't confuse them. 
 Uniforms! 
 Suck! 
* My country, 'tis of thee *  Sing louder, people! Louder! 
* Sweet land of liberty * * Of thee I sing * * Land where my fathers died * Five-head! 
 You're as light as a balloon. 
 What are you doing? 
I couldn't stay away. 
I need a kiss to get me through the day. 
But I thought we agreed we were going to sneak around. 
No one's gonna see us. 
They're all singing gospel. 
Come on, five-o. 
Just one smooch... 
and I'll never ask you for another favor again. 
* Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring * * Let freedom ring *  Everyone, shut up! 
Yeah. 
Shut up! 
Chastity, your your father's on the phone. 
Be strong. 
Daddy? 
No, you listen to me. 
Okay? I'm at school 
and in this uniform. 
Everyone looks the same. 
No, I'm not being a brat. 
Okay, you wanna go there? 
We'll go there. 
Ditch these stupid uniforms, or I'll tell Mommy how I found out... 
that your executive assistant doesn't wear a bra. 
Whoo! 
S-- I- I understand. 
Yes, sir. I 
Back to class. 
No more uniforms. 
Yeah! 
Whoa. Whoa. Wait! 
Our struggle has just begun. 
Call your dad back. What about our 
First and Fourth Amendment rights? 
They can still search our lockers! 
I don't have time for this crap. 
I got my own problem. 
Yeah! Whoo! 
Hey Chastity, great rally. 
Listen, I wanna talk to you about Joey. 
I know. I saw him kissing 
that blonde slut, too! 
I cannot believe that he would do this to me! Ugh! 
 You saw him kissing someone? 
 Some... thing. 
She looked like a a toothpick with hair. 
I couldn't make out her face. 
It was probably hideous. 
But I thought you said you were over him. 
Thank God they installed those security cameras. 
 Security cameras? 
 Yeah. 
All we have to do is review the footage, and then we'll know who she is. 
Then you'll help me destroy her, right? 
Sure. 
We'll get her. 
Thanks, B. 
I don't normally do this, but... 
You're the best friend I've ever had. 
What would I do without you? Mm! 
* Until we're free * So, should we sing something else? 
How about "Blowin' in the Wind"? 
Maybe we'll just sing in our heads. 
Can't. 
Plastic water bottle. 
 I could pour it in my hand. 
 I'd do that, I'm so thirsty. 
Eh, we'll recycle 'em. 
Dad, I know why you're here. 
It's okay. Unchain yourself. 
We need to talk. Now, Norma Rae. 
Be right back. 
Did that deep-voiced man-boy put you up to this? 
No. I'm just fighting 
for what I believe in. 
Principal Holland threatened to suspend you if you don't stop this right now. 
It would go on your permanent record. 
That's just an urban myth to scare smart kids into submission. 
I don't get this, Kat. You always wanted 
to go to an Ivy League school. 
They'll appreciate my social conscience. 
No. They'll label you 
a problem student. 
You know how competitive it is. 
They'll look for some reason to reject you. 
It's like enlisting in the army and writing down, "Oh, by the way, I'm gay." 
 Oh, I'm against that, too. 
 I'm just saying, pick your moments. 
I can't just give up. That's not 
what Mom would have wanted. 
Oh, no. 
You learned that one from me. 
Besides, Mom would've wanted you to see the big picture... 
and not be an idiot. 
Look, you have you whole life to save the world. Right now... 
don't give up your dream of going to Brown. 
This is not fair. 
 I shouldn't have to make this choice. 
 Then let me make it for you. 
You made your point. 
Go back to class. 
Got it? 
Got it. 
Great job, guys. 
No more uniforms. 
The school came together. 
I think we can call this a win. 
Now we should get back to class. 
You're kidding, right? 
We can regroup and figure out the next step. 
After all, none of us wants to get suspended. 
Wow. 
I guess everyone has their price. 
 Why is he so mad? 
 He's not mad. He's disappointed. 
It's going around. 
Cameron! Oh, God, 
I really need your advice. 
I just had the most awful thing happen with Chastity. 
You're gonna have to tell your problems to someone else. I can't do this. 
Do what? 
Be your friend, especially while you're wearing that perfume. 
 Then I won't wear it. 
 Don't you get it? 
I need time to get over you. 
I didn't sell out. 
I'm just thinking big picture. 
I wanna go to a first-rate college... 
so I can get a degree in social policy and change the world. 
 The real world, not high school. 
 You sound like one of them already. 
 What the hell? 
 Nice bag. 
Verona, hand it over. 
 Keep it. 
 What's going on? 
Young man, where do you think you're going? 
You walk out of here, you're suspended. 
Did you hear what I said? 
I wish we could spank them. 
 Hard. 
 Search this. 
Then can I keep it? 
You said I could keep it. 
You have no right to go through this. 
Kat, come back here with that, or you're suspended, too. 
Then I guess I'm suspended. 
Fight the power. 
* Hey! * 
This is yours. 
* I want you *  You sure about this? 
* To want me *  No. 
* I need you to need me *  But I'm doing it. 
* I'd love you to love me *  "Hold my hair." 
Excuse me? 
That's what you said to me at your party right before you hurled. 
* I want you to want me *  Nice. 
* I said *  Helmet. 
* I want you to want me Yeah * * I want you to want me Hey! * 
* I said I want you Hey! * 
* Whooaa! * 
 Hi, Dad. 
 Hi honeys. 
Sorry I wasn't there this morning to make pancakes for you, but... 
you never know when Mr. Stork 
is gonna pay a visit. 
You realize we know where babies come from, right ? 
Do you realize where they come out ? 
Trust me. Not pretty. 
It's the first day of school, remember the most important thing : Don't get pregnant ! 
I'm just saying. Boys want to put 
a baby in you. Are we clear, Bianca ? 
Well, they'd have to do it in vitro, since I can't date until Kat does. 
Then we're clear on the rules. 
I only make them because you girls mean so much to me. 
Your mother... 
predicted what smart, beautiful, young women... 
you'd grow into, and how right she was. 
She'd want you to know that. 
 Thanks, dad. 
 She'd also want you to know... 
syphillis, gonorrhea and genital herpes are on the rise... 
 among American teenagers. 
 Bye, Dad ! 
Push. 
We're heading to high school, not the Academy Awards. 
You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 
We're talking about teenagers. 
They're impressed by shiny objects Thus, my earrings. 
You could just try being yourself. 
Spoken like a true unpopular person. 
That never works. 
Using exhaustive Facebook, I've identified the most popular girl at school. 
I've then deconstructed her profile and used that data... 
to carefully plot out our first encounter... 
so as to easily befriend and beguile her. 
Beguile ? Big word, Shakespeare. 
Pull over here. 
I want to make an entrance. 
Your door is stuck. 
Your Highness. 
How do I look ? 
 Shallow. 
 Thank you ! 
You're the one speeding in a school zone. 
Do you mind ? 
This is my spot. 
 I was told spots aren't assigned. 
 No. They are assigned. 
By Charles Darwin. 
So, why don't you and your dinosaur head to the back... 
with the rest of the extinct species. 
Oh, my God. 
My car ! 
My dinosaur wanted to jurassic park here. 
 Hey, sophomore. 
 What are you wearing ? 
It's the new look for the new Michael. 
Goodbye, Mikey. 
Hello, Michael. 
Emo, hipster musician. 
You played piccolo in the marching band. 
High school is how you spin it. 
Even the biggest dorks can be cool. 
As long as they play their cards right. 
 Look at Shia LaBeouf. 
 I don't care about cool. 
I just want a girlfriend. 
every girl here remembers that tornado drill in 4 grade when I wet my pants. 
Can I press pause on this lifetime TV movie ? 
This is our year, man. 
Change is in the air. I can feel it. 
Hey, Mikey. 
What are you doing out of your locker ? 
Hey, Big-A. 
Back here on the senior year, I see. 
Hear the new Fallout Boy yet ? 
It slays. 
It's really good, man. You should 
check it out, they're a great band. 
My locker hates me. 
I could help you. 
17, 13, 11. 
Great combo, you'll never forget this. 
 Descending prime numbers. 
 Yay, math. 
You're new here ? 
Yep, my family just moved here from Ohio. 
Well,... 
if you need any directions, class advice or, or CPR, I am certified. 
 My name's Cameron. 
 Bianca. 
Thanks a lot. 
Love you. 
This is a very serious matter. 
Girls, tell me what happenned. 
What happenned is this... 
girl, mauled  my Mini Cooper. 
 No, I asserted my right to park. 
Those spaces are communal proper... 
Chastity, are you okay ? 
Does anything hurt ? 
My neck is a little bit sore. 
Probably from flipping your hair too much. 
You should go see the nurse right now. 
After all, we can't risk our head cheerleader having an injury just days before the first pep rally. 
Go, Penguins ! 
So, get out of here. 
And have a wonderful first day. 
What you did was dangerous. 
Very, very, very dangerous. 
I was going two miles an hour. 
Not exactly The Fast And The Furious. 
Listen, Carol... Karen... Katherine. 
I can tell from your transcripts you're gonna be a very effective... 
activist someday. 
I'm sure you'll really stick it to the man. 
But here at Padua High, the man... 
is Chastity. 
The daughter of the school board superintendent. 
This is a public school, where every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. 
No. That's private school. 
Here we keep Chastity happy, so that we keep our funding. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to kiss some ass. 
Mr. Verona, what a surprise ! 
Come in. 
Without the sharp object. 
Personal space. Ever heard of it ? 
What's she doing now ? 
Other than looking beautiful, of course. 
She's taking off her shirt Man, I figure they're a B-cup, tops. 
I don't have much time before her social status is determined. 
It's like she's about to reach into the sorting hat at Hogwarts. 
Well, then get over there Harry Pooper and pull out your wand. 
What do I say first ? 
Careful. 
Go slow, all right ? 
Sorry. 
So brave. 
Watch out. 
I wouldn't want you to fall in those... 
fierce shoes. 
 Marc Jacobs ? 
 Betsey Johnson. 
Besides, as my grandma used to say : "I can't be caught dead without my mascara" My grandma used to say that. 
No way. 
My favorite ban it's Coldplay, I love scrabulous. 
And my dream car is a metallic blue convertible Mini Cooper. 
I'm Chastity. 
Walk with me and tell me your life story. 
 Well, we just moved here from Ohio... 
 Wow, great story ! 
You should try for cheerleading. 
Too late. Voldemort's got her. 
Not so fast. 
All we need is a plan. 
 Your mom is at Wine Club tonight. 
 It's scary you know that. 
She gets a little flirty after... 
But, tonight, when they're gone,  we're gonna throw a party. 
 The last party we went to was a Bar Mitzvah. Yours. 
If we throw the first rage of the year we will be legends. 
And Bianca will be able to talk to you in public. 
 My mom will be home at midnight. 
 We call the cops at eleven... 
they break up the party and make it even more epic. 
Come on. Picture... 
greeting Bianca as she walks into this raging party... 
at your house. 
 At my house. 
 Yeah. 
We're not exactly Clooney and Pitt. 
How do we get people to come ? 
Trust me. 
I do. 
Don't worry, I won't bust you. 
Just had to get out of the lunch room. 
Apparently, it's no longer socially acceptable that you eat with your mouth closed. 
What's your name ? 
When you're a big time artist, I want to be able to say I knew you back in high school. 
Provided you're not in jail for vandalism. 
Mandella. 
Who is Captain Intensity over there ? 
Patrick Verona. People say 
he knows the taste of human flesh. 
Please. 
He's trying to act mysterious so he can get laid. 
Watch. 
Maybe we should stand somewhere else, somewhere out of state. 
There. Do you work 
in any other mediums ? 
 Favorite dog ? 
 Labradoodle. 
 Efron or Timberlake ? 
 No contest. Timberlake. 
 Project Runway ? 
 Love it. 
Want Tim Gunn to officiate my wedding. 
Well, we are so alike, it's scary. 
Hold this. 
Bianca... 
this is Joey Donner, my boyfriend. 
And Padua's starting quarterback. 
Babe. I told you I don't know if 
I'm gonna be starting this Friday. 
Well, let's hope so, because I don't date second... 
I'll see you at tryouts. 
I really hope that you don't suck. 
She's a sprit fire ? 
I can see why you love her. 
Yep. She's the best. 
 So I'm late for Chemistry. 
 Well, I'm late for Chemistry. 
After you. 
Tabitha, go ! 
I'm Tabitha Cook, student council secretary. 
A new school year is upon us. 
And you can just feel the excitement in the air. 
In order to get everyone excited, we'll be holding... 
Attention, Padua High School students. 
Is the end of summer bringing out your dark side ? 
Well, nothing cures the back to school blues better... 
than a kick-ass intergalactic party. 
Right, Chewie ? 
If you like to party, and you want to do it tonight... text 555-0127. 
Luke, I am your father. 
Hurry ! If we get caught in here, 
I'll get kicked out of the A/V club. 
You're one of two members. 
It's highly unlikely. 
 You think it worked ? 
 Yeah. It worked. 
 Nice wookie, by the way. 
 Thanks. 
Megan ! Enough. 
You all did really great at try-outs today... 
give yourselves a round of applause. 
The reason that we called today try-outs... 
is because not everyone can make it. 
If everyone could make it,... 
well, they instead would be called sign-ups. 
And that means that some... 
No, Most of you won't make the squad. 
Those of you who don't may beat yourselves up about it. 
Heck, some of you may regret it for the rest of your lives. 
You'll think back on, tomorrow, when I post the list, as the moment... 
when it all went wrong. 
So, good luck. 
Great speech. 
Very inspiring. 
But no one cried. 
Sorry. 
I'm expelling their loser energy. 
After all, you and I, are winners. 
There's Road Rage girl again. 
Of the ten things I hated about today, she is number one... 
number five, and number eight. 
Christ, will they allow anyone into public school. 
You're right. Dad's going to 
kill us if we're not home for dinner. 
Quit the charades and get in the car. 
See you tomorrow. 
By the way, you look... 
amazing in this light. 
Amazing ! 
She hates you. 
I'm touched. 
You've ruined my chances at being popular. 
I'm sorry, but that girl sucks. 
She's a teenage Kim Jong-il. 
Speak English, you show-off. 
Kim Jong-il, the dictator of North Korea. Dad ! 
North Korea ? So, what ? 
I'm talking about our high school... 
where I'm going to become unpopular. 
My life is unworth living. 
Yes. It's way worse than having 
bound feet or wearing a burka. 
 English ! 
 Enough ! 
Bianca, honey, look. 
I know you're upset, but Kat's right. 
Sometimes you get obsessed with popularity, keep things in perspective, that's all. 
 May I be excused ? 
 Already ? That's like a record. 
I don't need to carbo load. 
I'm not running a marathon tomorrow. 
 Thank you, dad. 
 For what ? 
For agreeing with me that popularty is a shallow, superficial thing to pursue. 
I don't agree with you. 
What ? 
What's wrong with being popular ? 
I loved it. 
I loved being captain of the football team... 
president of the student council. 
Any girl I wanted. 
That was uncle Jimmy. 
So, what ? 
Look, the problem is, it's the popular girls... 
and the popular boys, when they have S-E-X. 
Could you get the parmesan, please ? 
How much longer do I have to use this thing in the house ? 
Until you learn that a car is not a toy. 
 Today's actions could have much worse. 
 Told you. It wasn't an accident. 
Dad ! 
You bit me. 
That's the first thing you learn in my victims no more class. 
Where are your car keys ? I have to go 
to tell Chastity that you're adopted. 
You are not taking the car. 
You haven't even had Driver's Ed. 
It's a big go-kart, how hard can it be ? 
Fine. 
You drive me. 
No way, Miss Daisy. 
I'll tell dad you're not a virgin. 
You have one hour. 
See, I didn't realize the person who throws the party is also supposed to supply the alcohol. 
But I have a surprise ! 
Keg's here. 
Courtesy of me. 
Mike Bernstein, sophomore, musician and legend. 
Enjoy, everybody. 
How did you get a keg ? 
 It's nonalcoholic beer. 
 My God. They're going to know. 
By the time they figure out they're not drunk the cops will have busted up the party. 
 Yeah ? 
 She's here. 
 Welcome to my home. 
 Thanks, Cameron. 
 It's nice. 
 I can't take credit. 
I have an gay uncle who dabbles at decorating. 
This theme was Suburban Rainforest. 
How fascinating. 
Listen, do you know if Chastity is here ? 
I don't. 
But I could help you look. 
Enough. 
All right, Hannibal Lecter. 
Let's cut to the chase. 
You want some of this ? 
No ? Now, how about some of this ? 
What do you want ? 
What do you mean ? 
I mean : Do you want to deal me drugs ? 
Or, steal my car ? 
Or, harvest my organs ? 
Why are people scared of you ? 
Why are people scared of you ? 
 People are not scared of me. 
 Sure they are. 
That's why I find you interesting. 
Tell me more about liking Ohio. 
Well, they have a good outlet mall. 
Oh, fascinating. What stores ? 
A little closet time ? 
Is it true ? 
I swear I never showed anybody our video. 
No ! Is it true that Tommy is starting 
in Friday's game ? 
Coach said I needed to work on my three-step drop. 
Which is what you should have been doing all summer instead of taking those stupid modeling classes. 
Maybe this is a sign that modeling is my future. 
Joey... 
I am the youngest head cheerleader in the history of Padua high school. 
My future is dating the quarterback. 
Not a catalog model. 
 Look, I could be high fashion. 
 OK. 
Bianca ? 
I thought that you were Chastity. 
She thinks it's dumb that I want to be a male model, but check this out. 
You're really smiling with your eyes. 
Modelling is hard work. 
I mean, I'm making it look easy. 
People think it just happens. 
I know how you feel. 
You want to be a model too ? 
 No. 
 I mean, I think you could. 
 You've got a great bone structure. 
 Why aren't you chasing after me ? 
 How dare you ? 
 It's not what you think. 
We have Chemistry together. 
The class, not the other thing. 
We match. 
Get out. 
Hey, how's the party ? 
Right, buddy ? 
Let's do this. 
We're the world's last superpower and yet we don't have universal health care. 
Are you talking to me, or the Democrats in your head ? 
Dad, have you seen that box of old piano sheet music ? 
No, honey. Why ? 
Since I'm not going to be popular, I guess I'll join the show choir. 
Closeted gay guys are fun. 
 She doesn't seem like herself. 
 I know, isn't it great ? 
Come on. Dad, she's obsessed 
with what other people think. 
Mom would not approve. 
You know, your mother saw Bianca's ability to fearlessly dive into any social situation as one of her best traits. 
 She did ? 
 She did. 
She also loved your respect for others, and your sense of fairness, which is why I find it strange that someone so passionate about universal health care could lack any compassion for her own sister. 
You're good. 
You're the one who played the dead mom card. I just served it back. 
Oh, my God, I love this part. 
Seeing all their crushed, sad, little faces makes me realize how lucky we are. 
And we should never forget it. 
I'll meet you girls outside. 
I'm gonna do a second coat. 
Build the suspense. 
See ya. 
 I love this part. 
 I knew it. 
I don't want to be a part of any lesbian locker room fantasy. 
 I'm here to talk about my sister. 
 Oh, what a coincidence ! 
I was just about to send her to social Siberia. 
Look, Bianca and I are completely different people. 
I wanna be somebody, and she wants to be... you. 
Big deal, every girl on this school wants to be me. 
And the guys in show choir. 
 Put her on the squad. 
 Not a chance. 
 Move it, Elphaba. 
 Bring it on, skinny bitch. 
What are you doing ? 
Stop. I wasn't ready. It's morning. 
I signed up to be yearbook photo editor. 
I'm sure that'll look really good on your community college application. 
Which means I'm in charge of all the photos that go in it. 
Put her on the squad, or in every page you'll be sporting a double chin, a muffin top or cankles. 
Freaky friends forever. 
Bianca ! Hey. 
Listen, I think I was a little bit hard on you. 
After all, you can't help who... 
or what or what your sister is. 
And Joey told me about his confusion. 
He's confused. A lot. 
And I guess buying the same blouse does show that you have good taste. 
I asked a hundred people in Times Square who wore it best. 
You won. 
I am prepared to give you a second chance. 
I'm a cheerleader ? 
Not quite. 
But, you can be the mascot. 
Percival the Penguin. 
 The mascot. 
 Well, you'll be on the squad. 
One of us. Only covered in fur. 
Which means you don't have to worry about fixing you hair color. 
So, what do you say ? 
Poor Percival. 
You know he had two kids ? 
No, I didn't. 
But I do know the inside of his head smells like a field of armpits. 
Hey, at least I made the cheerleading squad. 
You did. 
Happy day. 
Now I can focus on passing French. 
It's way beyond what I had in Ohio. 
I could tutor you. 
I mean, if you want. 
You would do that ? 
See ? I didn't get any of that. 
You're a lifesaver. 
See you tomorrow. 
Adi�s. 
I mean, Ciao. 
I've gotta learn French. 
You guys could really be wearing helmets. 
Safety first. 
Let's go before someone sees me in this piece of crap. 
Tough talk from the girl carrying the giant penguin head. 
I made the squad. 
That's what counts. 
It turns out, Chastity is a real sweet, forgiving person. 
Nothing like that Long Duck Dong. 
 Kim Jongil ? 
 Whatever. 
No more NPR. 
It's giving me a menopause. 
What was that sound ? 
Justice. 
You have got to be kidding me ! 
Hate About You... 
We did not get a chance to officially meet. 
 Kat Stratford. 
 William Blankenship. 
So it's theoretically possible that you could be interested in someone besides me? 
Yes, if she wasn't just a theoretical person. 
Your mother was the love of my life, and after she died, I never thought I'd want to meet someone again, but just that little spark of anticipation made me realize life goes on. 
You betrayed me. 
It's not personal, it's just politics. 
One day, Brangelina will be obsolete, and all of your diligent studying will have been for naught. 
That's a fancy word for nothing. 
You're welcome. 
Thanks. For transferring 
out of the school? 
I have two tickets I can't use for the Andrecorso's art opening tonight, Mad Cow Fire. 
It was denied federal funding for being Too controversial. 
I'm dying to see it. 
Wait. I don't like you. 
You can't still be upset about meatless Mondays. 
That was two weeks ago. 
What if I reluctantly, yet sincerely, begged for your forgiveness? 
Mm, sorry. I'm not charmed 
by the Masterpiece Theater act. 
Jack the Ripper had a British accent, too. 
You honestly find me that awful? 
I think you should be deported, and if I didn't have such strong reservations about the INS, I would report you. 
All rightie then. 
Pleasure as-- Well, never. 
Fine. 
I'll take them off your hands. 
Thanks. 
You can go. 
Hey. 
Hey back. 
Do you want to see this cool modern art show tonight? 
Let me think for a second. 
Spend a night staring at blobs of paint, pretending they don't look like bird crap. 
Ah, but this is different. 
Some of his paintings are made with bird droppings. 
He believes in using everyday materials Oh, never mind. 
Fivehead, I just got us tickets to the French club's movie night. 
I think it's Saturday at 7, but I'm not sure, 'cause the dude selling the tickets only spoke French. 
What does ...mean? 
That's not even close to French. 
Let me see the tickets. 
Tres Jolie? 
Man, I'd love to see that on the big screen. 
So allez avec nous. 
Oh, come on, you guys are a couple. 
I don't want to, you know, get all up in that. 
No, you do not. 
Dawn just broke up witMax. 
We can all go together, and if the movie's lame, we can leave together. 
Sweet. 
A bientÃ´t, mes amis. 
Not French. 
Tickets. 
Are you sure Dawn's going to be into this? 
Why wouldn't she be? 
It's just a movie. 
It's a make-out movie. 
Translate By Mumy  Gross. I'm not going 
to a make-out movie with you and Joey. 
No, not like that. Ew. 
Cameron's going, so it'll be me and Joey and a couple people hanging out together in, like, a casual group thing. 
Sounds like a fix-up. 
Sorry, Bianca. 
I only have 126 Saturday nights left before college, and I promised my dad I'd start taking school seriously. 
I can't waste one on a nork. 
Please? I already 
told him you'd go. 
Plus, what else are you going to do? 
All that's on TV are shows about people who want to dance or can't dance or do dance with overly tan celebrities. 
That's true. 
But what if Cameron thinks this is a date and falls in love with me? 
Just watching you go through that was so annoying. 
He won't. I'll make sure of it. 
Just don't look too gorgeous. 
Okay. But if I get bored, 
I'm peeling you off Joey's face and making you hang out with us. 
Yay. 
Yay. 
You don't have to pretend you're not trying to fix us up. 
I know you. 
You can't help yourself. 
What? No. Yes, I can. 
She and Max broke up. 
I'm available. Well done. 
You should see her baby pics on Facebook. 
And she's a Leo. I'm an Aries. 
The universe is smiling down on this union. 
No, the universe is freaking out right now because you're already off the rails. 
Look, Bianca, I know I thought I loved you and Stacy and that girl in homeroom who said hi to me, but this thing with Dawn has real potential. 
Cameron, there is no thing. 
You've got to stop falling in love like this if you want any chance at a normal life. 
But not falling in love is hard. 
Don't worry. 
I'll coach you. 
Whenever you feel like you're falling for Dawn, just recite this mantra. 
Look me in the eyes. 
These are not feelings of love. 
Okay. These are not 
feelings of love. 
Now own it. 
These are not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
Ooh, that would go perfect in our living room. 
First, I have a taser in my purse, and second, I have your ticket, so why are you here? 
I gave you my extra tickets. 
And you're welcome. 
Thank you. Now please let me 
enjoy the exhibit in peace. 
Materials-- Human blood and elephant dung. 
I hope he didn't finger paint this. 
There it is. 
I knew I could make you smile. 
Oh, that wasn't a smile. 
It was a wince. 
Really? 
Your humor causes me physical pain. 
Right. 
Hi, sweetie. 
Guess what? 
That nice Ms. Tharpe 
from your fake intervention left me a voice mail asking if I wanted to chaperone your movie night, to which I will reply, "Sign me up." 
Sorry, Dad, but you're too late. 
Those chaperone slots are like hot donuts. 
They go fast. 
Darn it. I'm sure 
they could have used my expertise. 
All these squishy parents nowadays want to be friends with their kids. 
Kids don't need more friends. 
They need old, scary people to intimidate them. 
Well, Dad, you'll really be missed. 
That was close. 
Could you imagine my dad chaperoning a make-out movie? 
What? What did you say? 
A make-out movie? 
Dawn's expecting me to kiss her? 
I've never kissed a human girl. 
No, no, no, no. 
There will be no kissing. 
Dawn's still hung up on Max Morita. 
Now eat your apple sauce. 
Poor Dawn. 
I've been there. 
Bet she could use a hug. 
Mantra. 
These are not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
Well, that was bloody awful. 
You seriously think a show like that deserves government funding? 
Just because we thought it was crappy, pun intended, doesn't mean it shouldn't be supported. 
Maybe he's ahead of his time, like Van Gogh. 
Oh, it's Van Gogh. 
But if art is subjective, then it should be driven by the marketplace. 
So based on that logic, last year's best film was, what, The Hangover? 
Oh, it's up there. 
Come on, the naked guy in the trunk? Amazing. 
Tonight was fun, right? 
Yeah, shockingly. 
How about a proper date? 
What? 
I'll pick you up. 
You'll wear your good jeans. 
I'll offend you by opening the door, you'll lecture me on women's rights, so I'll let you pick up the check. 
As enticing as that sounds, I can't. 
I'm seeing someone. 
The motorcycle chap? 
He's your boyfriend? 
We don't feel the need to label everything. 
So does that mean that you and your non-boyfriend can see other people? 
No, I think. 
Look, I just can't go a date with you, okay? 
It's complicated. 
Well, if it ever gets uncomplicated, let me know. 
So I'm prepping for our make-out-a-thon. 
I've been eating eucalyptus leaves, parsley, and last night, my mom made garlic toast, my fave, and all I did was smell it. 
Joey, that's so sweet. 
I can't wait to make out with you for three hours. 
I know. Me too. 
And fingers crossed, we'll be able to reach a legendary kissers' high. 
What's that? 
Oh, Bianca. 
When you're kissing that long, you're breathing in each other's air and your brain goes into this sparkly Zen place and you feel like you're floating above and looking down at yourself. 
Joey, are you sure that's not astral projecting? 
No, that's when you have a sexy dream. 
Hey, Bianca, the mantra is working. 
Last night, I had the urge to call Dawn, but I didn't. 
At least not on a real phone. 
Nice self-control. 
And then she sat next to me in study hall. 
Don't worry, coach. 
Every time I almost said "I want to live in your hair "and vacation on the tippy tip of your cute little nose," I did my mantra in my head These are not feelings of love And then said normal stuff. 
Yay. Go us. 
Yeah. 
Hi, guys. 
Cameron, wear blue tomorrow. 
It'll make your eyes jump off your face. 
And try to style your hair like Jake Gyllenhaal, with that swoosh thing. 
Sure, if I got time. 
Why don't I do it for you? 
Let me see what I'm working with. 
Down. 
You need product. 
Come on. Got some mousse 
in my locker. 
These are not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
Hey, Patrick. 
How lame was the art show? 
Not lame at all, actually. 
His work has this savagery to it that's really primal. 
Sounds kinky. 
Blank was there. 
Blank. Stupid name. 
What, his parents were too lazy to come up with, like, Bob? 
It's a nickname. 
His name is William. 
Still lame. 
It was a weird night. 
In addition to the bloody limbs and severed dolls' heads, he asked me out. 
Oh, yeah? 
Yeah. 
I mean, yeah. 
So what did you say? 
What do you think I said? 
I don't know. 
I wasn't there. 
Are you going to go? 
Why would I do that? 
Why wouldn't you? 
So you'd have no problem with me going on a date with him? 
Why would I? 
This is a free country. 
You remind me of that all the time. 
If you want to go, go. 
Okay, I will. 
Have a nice time. 
I plan on it. 
May I present the winning look. 
Why are you going through all this trouble for Cameron? 
You said he was a nork. 
That was before I got to know him. 
That was two days ago. 
It feels like forever. 
He's so bumbly and funny and such a good listener. 
Every time I talk, he stops to process what I've said. 
Think how cute our kids would be Half-Asian and the perfect height. 
Kids? Dawn, you're not 
supposed to like Cameron. 
You're supposed to tolerate him, remember? 
Yeah, but I could use a nice boyfriend, especially one who can pick me up and carry me around. 
Just think, when we go to a concert, I could finally see what's going on. 
Back up, back way up. 
You can't do this to Cameron. 
He's fragile and innocent and vulnerable. 
Aw, like a sweet little baby lamb. 
No, not like a lamb, like a boy who will fall in love with you and be devastated when in 24 to 48 hours, you fall in love with someone else. 
You're right, you're right. 
I bet he's never even kissed a girl. 
He hasn't. 
Clay Aiken has more experience with women than he does. 
So I'll just have to kiss him and see if he's the one. 
Yeah, I'm just about to watch some riveting television about people dancing. 
Dad, Ms. Tharpe just called. 
A chaperone just cancelled. 
You're off the wait list. 
I'll grab my kit. 
âª  âª  âª I can't believe this many Padua students are willing to read subtitles. 
There's not loads of dialogue in the film. 
I mean, has anybody actually spoken yet? 
Shh, Jolie is about to speak. 
Do you find Jolie to be too whimsical, or not whimsical enough? 
A tad too whimsical, especially the way she walks with one foot on the curb and one foot in the street. 
She's going to get whimsically hit by a bus. 
Hands where I can see them. 
Bianca, why is your dad here? 
All body parts on top of the blankets. 
Oh, I have no clue. 
Great, now no one can make out. 
Not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
Hey, Daddy, over here. 
Hi, honey. 
Hi, kids. 
Hey! 
Warning shot. 
Dr. Stratford, I'm so glad 
you could make it. 
I didn't think you were interested. 
Are you kidding? 
I live to keep teenagers from having fun. 
Wow. 
Um, we're low on soda at the concession stand. 
Would you help me restock? 
I'd do it myself, but I just have these tiny little bird wrists. 
I'm not being sexist, just stating a fact. 
I'm on it. 
Just follow me, this way. 
Oh, boy. 
Look, Dawn. Paris. 
It's so beautiful. 
We should go backpacking there. 
Dawn, look. 
The Eiffel Tower. 
Okay, I'm going in. 
I'll see you in three hours. 
We should have known. 
That this would be a Roman orgy? 
Come on, people. 
You're in public. 
Well, if we can't beat these hedonists, I say we Join them? No, thank you. 
This has swine flu written all over it. 
I was going to say ignore them. 
Mmm, this is good. 
And messy. 
You've got a little, uh Chocolate on your Thanks. 
I'm sorry, I can't do this. 
I know, I know. 
It's complicated. 
Which is ironic, because Leather Jacket Man is so simple. 
What do you mean by that? 
I'm just guessing here, but I can't see e two of you sitting around debatin off-shore drilling. 
Look, we debate lots of stuff. 
Just stop talking about him fore you Before what? 
Before I tell you what you already know? 
That you're too good for him? 
I can't believe you just said that out loud. 
You are such an elitist. 
You can't tell me the thought hasn't crossed yr mind. 
I don't know who I find more annoying, you or Jolie. 
This date is over. 
You have to come to my parents' house in Laguna this summer. 
Oh, I just got accepted into space camp, but I can bail. 
It's just space. 
Oh, Dawn. 
I don't remember my life before we kissed. 
Mantra. 
I'll be right back. 
These are not feelings of love. 
These are not feelings of love. 
Female incomin the re of high school   or you'd daydreaming about living in some girl's hai Thmantra's not worng. 
And you want to know why? 
Because these are feelings of love. 
Da's into me. 
She invited me to Laguna. 
Th's what she es. 
She falls in love every other day, just like you, except she'll be over it morrow and you won't. 
Well, this feels real  me, so I'd appreciate it if you would butt out. 
She asked me to proofread this e-mail she wrote to Max Morita. 
Hey, Max, it would be so awesome if you could hang at my parents' house in Laguna this summer. 
She wrote that three days ago. 
There's a typo. 
Laguna has one "g," just so you know. 
I'm sorry. 
I just don't want to see you get your heart broken. 
Thanks. 
Wow. Walter, 
what a heart-breaking story. 
Thank you for sharing your truth with me. 
I'm afraid I've over-shared. 
Maybe it's the couch, or just that you're so easy to talk to. 
I just feel for you. 
Raising two teenage girls by yourself It just seems really lonely. 
I've lost people too, Walter. 
My first fiancÃ©e, he fell overboard on a booze cruise in Cozumel. 
I'm so sorry. 
I thought he was dead, for many years. 
Then I found him on Facebook. 
Well, man like that's bound to fall off something else. 
Where do you think you're going? 
Patrick? 
We're going home. 
Well, I guess congratulations are in order. 
You're walking on two legs. 
Okay Why don't you get on your broom stick and fly back to whatever Harry Potter movie you came from? 
Stop it. 
I don't want to hurt you. 
That's weird, 'cause I want to hurt you a lot. 
Let's go. 
Are you kidding me? 
All right, sorry, guys. 
Whoever beats the crap out of each other does not win me! 
Stay away from my girlfriend. 
Okay, I do have a problem with you seeing other guys. 
Good. So we're exclusive. 
No, I'm going to see other people. 
I just don't want you to. 
You guys just missed Jolie dancing in a rain puddle. 
Uh, I feel like watching the movie now. 
Yeah, but I want to make out. 
Why don't you make out with Max Morita? 
What? 
Hope the beach house is big enough for all the guys you invited. 
Bianca, you showed him my Max e-mail? 
I didn't even send that. 
I was trying to protect him. 
I asked you to back off, and you wouldn't. 
You know what your problem is? 
You are too meddling in Cameron's love life. 
I am not. 
Yes, you are. 
You kind of are. 
For your "informash," I'm crazy about this guy. 
I like him for the reasons you like him as a friend. 
I don't care if you believe it. 
It's happening. 
Cameron, we're moving. 
Pick me up. 
Okay. 
What's going on with you, Fivesies? 
Why are you obsessing over them? 
It's just weird. 
They're my best friends. 
It's like sixth grade all over again, when Jojo Riverton and Amy Gardella went to Wild Water Kingd without me. 
I know it's not the same, but I'll go to Wild Water Kingdom with you. 
I mean, for real. 
It sounds awesome. 
On "10 Things I hate About You"... 
Chastity, I have something to tell you. 
I'm the one who kissed Joey. 
Kat, just get in the car and drive. 
I will see you at school tomorrow! 
I heard some good news today. 
Someone got suspended. 
Who was it again? Oh, that's right, 
it was you. 
Thanks to you, I'm still an Ivy League candidate. 
You're also a liar. What? 
This whole time, you've been telling me this is about your principles. 
You forgot to mention your principles drive a motorcycle. 
So it was Patrick's bag. 
That's not why I left. 
Dad! 
Creamed corn for breakfast? You know, 
corn comes in these cool little flakes now. 
I'm not going to eat it. 
I'm going to pour it in the toilet and tell Dad I threw up. 
Ah, trying to stay home from school. 
Use minestrone. 
It's more believable. 
Do we have any? If I show my face, 
Chastity will torture me for being with Joey. 
Ha, got you. Morning, Dad. 
Hi, Daddy. 
Morning, sweetie. 
Creamed corn for breakfast? 
Uh, yeah. I was in the 
mood for something creamy. 
Let me heat it up. Otherwise, 
it might end up in the toilet. 
Go get ready. Since your sister 
lost her driving privileges, I'm taking you to school. 
And I'll be riding the bus, which is totally fair. 
I accept my punishment without protest. 
Dad, enough with the silent treatment. 
How can I earn your trust back? 
Drug test? Polygraph? 
I'll do anything. 
Okay. Stop seeing that 
deep-voiced man-boy. 
Patrick Verona and I are not seeing each other. 
And even if we were, which we're not, you can't just tell me to stop. 
Oh, I thought I could. 
Let's compare copies of the parents' handbook. 
Oh, wait. You don't have one. 
It's not his fault I got suspended. 
I see. He's not the killer. 
He just happens to be around whenever a body shows up. 
Kat, you lied to me. 
You didn't do that before you met him. I didn't lie. 
I just didn't mention it because I didn't want you to overreact. 
I was trying to prevent this. 
So you were just being considerate. 
Pardon me for not saying thank you. 
I don't trust him. 
Forget about him. Trust me. 
That's the problem. 
Now I don't trust you around him. 
Dad, you don't even know him. 
You're right. I should 
get to know him better. 
Invite him over for dinner. 
You can't be serious. 
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU Episode 12: "DON'T TRUST ME". 
English Version By ISUBS.COIL.US. 
Five alive, I've been looking for you all morning. 
You won't believe this awesome dream I had last night. 
I had just shaved my chest, and you were rubbing warm oil Joey, no PDA. 
Why not? Chastity knows 
we're together now. 
Because I had a dream, too, where she assaulted me with a frozen yogurt and then threatened to kill me. 
Oh, wait. Not a dream. 
Relax. It's been a whole weekend. 
I'm sure she's over it by now. 
Here she comes. 
No, seriously though, your hair looks amazing. 
It's like this peaceful waterfall of wonderful. 
That's exactly what I was going for. 
Hi, Chastity. Love the new look. 
See? She didn't even say anything. 
I told you she'd be over it. 
Joey, you don't understand girls at all. 
I'm being iced out. Come here. 
Later. Later. 
Hey, Cameron. 
Boy, you're hard to find. 
I've got some bad news. 
You've made the superlatives page. 
Oh, let me guess. Most likely 
to fart during an oral report. 
No, nothing like that. 
You're Mr. Dependable. 
No, that's worse. 
Really? That's hard to believe. 
Mr. Dependable? 
I'll be forever pegged as a doormat. 
And why "Mister"? 
It sounds vaguely emasculating. 
Come on, it's not that bad. 
Mr. Rogers. Mr. Belvedere. 
There's Mr. T. I pity the 
fool who forgets him. 
Girls don't want to date Mr. 
Dependable. 
They want to date Mr. 
Quarterback or Mr. Sixpack 
or Mr. Stupid Jerk. 
Some girls would appreciate a guy who's dependable enough to respond to a simple text message. 
Oh, Lexie. 
You know about the photo shoot. 
You've been anointed Ms. 
Dependable. 
Me? You're kidding. 
This is Cameron. 
He's Mr. Dependable. 
I hear they're calling us the dream team. Funny. 
Well, I'll see you at the shoot then, Mister. 
Look at you, getting your flirt on. 
I don't know where that came from. 
Dream team. Hi, everyone. 
I brought everyone chocolate chip cookies warm, right out of the cafeteria oven. 
Come on, Chastity's not even here. 
Does anyone hear a little mosquito buzzing around? 
It's so annoying. 
I wish it would go away. 
Look, I'm sorry for what happened. 
I really am. 
I just want to be friends again. 
Yeah, can't we-- You should have thought of that before you broke the girl code. 
But Joey and Chastity were already broken up. 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the girl code says you can date a friend's ex if she's moved on. 
But you need permission first. 
And at least two witnesses. 
But then nobody could date anybody. 
Okay, the girl code clearly states, and I quote, even if the first girl gives permission, she could just be saying it without meaning it, so the second girl should be sensitive enough not to force the first girl to spell it out, thus making her feel worse. 
End quote. 
Okay, Miss South Carolina, that made no sense. 
Let me make it clear for you. 
You violated a sacred trust, and now none of us wants to be friends with you anymore. 
Right, girls? Mm-hm. 
I get it. I'm in Siberia. 
But can't you just leave me one friend? 
How about Dawn? You always 
said her voice was too nasal. 
I'll do anything Wash your uniform, flat-iron your hair, just name it. 
I don't know. How about 
you break up with Joey? 
What? 
But there has to be something else. Nope, 
that's it. That's what you have to do. 
You break up with him, and I'll give you your life back. 
Mm, cookies. Yummy. 
Mandela. 
Hey. 
Hey. I was looking for 
you at lunch today. 
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages. 
It's kind of hard, trying to make time for friends when you're in a new relationship. 
Patrick Verona and I are not in a new relationship. 
We hung out twice. Who knows if 
I'll ever hear from him again? 
Well, I-- Hey. 
I just need two seconds. 
It's fine. I got to go anyway. 
Call you later. 
PATRIK I just got your text. 
What's this stupid thing you want to ask me? 
Okay. You know how 
my dad is insane. 
He made me watch a slide show of some chick giving birth, so yeah. 
Now he wants you to come to dinner. I'll pass. 
I told you it was stupid, but he's afraid you're a bad influence on me. 
Huh. I wonder why. 
Look, if you don't come over, he says we can't hang out. 
He never has to know. 
This is really, like, high school 101. 
But my dad doesn't trust me anymore, and I'm not going to lie to him again. 
It's just lasagna. In or out? 
I don't do family dinners. 
So that's your answer? Yup. 
Fine. See you around. 
Oh, hi, honey. How was your day? 
Did you invite the man-boy? 
He's not coming to dinner. 
He didn't want to submit to the Inquisition. 
Are you happy now? 
Of course I'm not happy. 
Kat, if this boy really liked you, he'd make the effort. 
Thank you for saying that out loud, Dad. 
That really makes me feel so much better. 
Oh, Kat. 
"No more Mr. Man-Boy! 
We won't see the man-boy! 
"She won't kiss the man-boy." 
Bianca. 
Dawn, can we talk? We can't. 
This is killing me, but if Chastity finds out, she will ice me out too, and last year, Jenny Young got iced out so bad, she had to move. 
I don't want to move. 
Our house has a pool. 
But I miss you so much. 
Yesterday, John Gosselin did something super skeevy, and I had nobody to share it with. 
Oh, my God, this is so not fair. 
Can't we figure something out? 
I mean, you're on my maid of honor short list. 
Oh, my God. 
You're on my short list. 
Maybe you should dump Joey. 
You've only been dating a week, and we're going to be at each other's weddings. 
But he's so cute, and I like him so much. 
But I'll be there for you every step of your sadness. 
We'll pig out and watch trash TV, and before you know it, you'll be on to the next guy. 
I'd hug you, but Chastity might smell you on me. 
Well, well, well, Ms. Dependable. 
We meet again. 
Mr. D. What a surprise. 
I was wondering whether you've selected your attire for tomorrow's festivities. 
I would hate for us to clash. 
Well, why don't I give you my number, and you can call me tonight and we will work something out. 
Oh, hey, can I borrow a pen and a piece of paper? 
Yeah, I just-- I need to write this down before it smudges. 
It's a girl's number. I am on fire! 
Hey, Five-o, did you hear? 
We were just named cutest couple. 
I was just putting together a list of poses that best convey cutest. 
Joey, you really shouldn't be doing that. 
But I'm a model. It's what I do. 
No, I mean I told them we can't accept the honor. 
But who's cuter than us? No one. 
Chastity's convinced all the other cheerleaders that I'm breaking the girl code. 
The thing is, I have to choose between my friends and you. Man, that sucks. 
Wait, you're not choosing me? 
Joey, this past week with you has been amazing. 
But we're just high school sweethearts. 
Who knows if we'd even last till prom? 
But high school girlfriends last forever. 
Okay. First of all, 
you're not choosing me? 
But I'm Joey Donner, captain of the football team. 
Plus, they just voted me best profile and whitest teeth and flattest abs. 
And further plus... 
I'm a good guy. I'm sorry. 
Okay, then. 
But just think about this If your friends were really your friends, would they make you choose? 
I can't believe you didn't pick me. 
Joey, wait. 
Hi, Dad. 
What's all this? 
Just making some dinner. 
Bianca's not hungry, so that just means more for us. 
Ham? You don't eat ham. 
No, but Patrick Verona does. 
I asked him what he wanted for dinner, and he said ham. He's coming here? 
Yes. He confessed that the 
reason he freaked out yesterday is because he's starting to feel such strong feelings for me. 
He felt really vulnerable. 
He said that? Mm. 
Vulnerable. With his deep voice. 
Mm-hm. 
Honestly, Dad, asking him to dinner is the best thing that could have happened to us. 
It's pushed us into this whole new level of intimacy, so thank you. Oh, there he is. 
Can you get that? 
I have to check the ham. 
Look at me, using a meat thermometer. 
Hey, Dr. Stratford. 
Hey, babe. Mm, I smell ham. 
Okay, enough of that. I have a fork, 
and I'm not afraid to use it. 
So Patrick, tell me about your family. 
My dad's a tattoo artist. 
In fact, when he gets out of debt, he wants to open his own shop. 
He's kind of a dreamer. Oh. I see. 
And does your mom work? Yes, sir. 
I guess you could call her a dancer. Honey, 
broccoli? No. I don't eat anything green. 
Right. 
So what are you interested in studying at school? Well, I've always wanted to be an 
astronaut. 
An astronaut? Really? 
I hope you're working hard at science and math. 
Mm. Well, my back-up plan 
is to bum around Europe. 
How fun would that be? 
Not as much fun as college. 
But, Dad, I could defer for a year. 
Get a little life experience under my belt. 
Nothing goes under your belt. 
We'll talk about this later. 
So Dr. Stratford, 
can I ask you something? Sure. 
You're a gyno. What's up with that? 
What do you an? I mean, 
isn't it weird? 
Like, do you ever run into one of your patients at the market and think "Ooh"? That's it. 
Okay, it's not weird. 
And I can't believe you asked me that at the dinner table. 
Not only are you nowhere near qualified to be an astronaut, you are nowhere near qualified to see my daughter. Get out. 
Get out. What's so funny? 
Dad, we made all of that up. 
You've been punked. 
That went well. He deserved that. 
Was that true about your parents? 
Just one of them. 
Hey. 
Who did this? Oh, it wasn't me. 
But whoever did it should know that I'm a huge fan. 
Huge. 
Chastity, I get it. 
I'm dating your ex. 
And even though I've apologized multiple times, I understand why you're mad at me. 
But what I don't understand is why the rest of you are icing me out. 
Oh, my God. We had this conversation. 
The girl code, remember? 
Or do you need another recitation? 
Brittany, who loaned you a fresh pair of shorts when you needed them the most? 
You did. 
And, Caitlin, who stopped you from cutting your own bangs? 
You did. 
And, Dawn, have you forgotten all of our fun adventures? 
Our web kiss, our raging party. 
Those were fun adventures. 
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. We get it. 
I thought you guys were my friends. 
I broke up with Joey so we could stay friends. 
And then, a second later, I got back together with him, because I realized real friends would never make me choose between them and my totally hot, wonderful new boyfriend. 
And that concludes this amateur production of Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Thank 
you. 
Oh, here they are our cutest couple, right on time. 
Mandela. 
Yeah, hi. Kat, this is-- Oh, 
no, no, no. Hell, no. 
You did not tell me she was going to take the picture. 
I told you, Baby, we're just good friends. 
Friends? Uh-uh. She's no friend of mine. 
Why did she just spit on me? 
That's my new girlfriend, baby. 
She's sweet, but crazy jealous. 
Is it weird I find it hot? 
Hello? Mandy, I'm waiting. 
I'm sure she'll calm down, some day, but in the mean time, it's probably best if we don't talk. 
This is just plain disrespectful. 
I'm out of here. 
Baby, wait. Good luck with Patrick. 
Ms. D, we are eagerly awaiting 
your presence at the photo shoot. 
Now, I don't know if you got any of my voice mails or text messages last night, but I did indeed go with the khaki pants and a sports jacket, so that should go with just about anything. Any-Hoo, 
This is Mr. D, signing off. 
Okay, Dependables, you're up. 
But Lexie isn't here yet, and she hasn't returned any of my calls. 
I'm worried she may not be that dependable after all. 
Oh, you mean Lexie Greenburg. 
Yeah, Kat got her confused with Lexie Greenblatt. 
She's our real Ms. Dependable. 
Okay. Not a loss. It's fine. 
It's totally fine. 
I flirted with a cute girl, and she gave me her number. 
I call that a step in the right direction. 
Whatever, dude. Let's just take 
the picture. Come on. Let's go. 
Come on, come on. Hey, thanks, Kat. 
I smell ham. 
Hey. Just wanted to make sure your 
dad didn't lock you in the basement. 
Luckily, we don't have one, but it's still kind of tense. 
You know what? I think it's cool 
how upset he gets about you. 
It shows how much he cares. 
Guess what. 
Congratulations, you guys were named Cutest Couple. 
People love their Katrick. No. 
You made the right decision, Fiver. I'll be 
your best friend and your boyfriend. 
Thanks, Joey, but it's not the same. 
See, when I get a text from you, who am I going to talk to about how long I should wait till I text you back? 
And how am I going to dissect your every move? 
It's not as much fun if I do it with you. 
Hey, Bianca. We're making a 
smoothie run. You want to come? 
What about Chastity? 
We told her that you're our friend, and we're not going to ice you out. 
Still, we should grab some for Chastity. 
Well, I'm just saying. 
Are you okay if I-- Go, have fun. 
I'll call you later. 
Hey, guys, wait up. 
Oh, my God. I am so going to mention 
this moment in my toast at your wedding. 
Are we going to talk about this? 
Dad, you're an adult. 
Use your words. 
What you did to me last night was very mean-spirited. 
Hey, you started it. 
Really? How so? 
You made me invite Patrick over for dinner because you were hoping it would scare him off. 
Don't be preposterous. 
And even if I did, can you blame me? 
You were disobeying rules, getting into trouble, disregarding me I'm not going to just sit by and watch while your life spirals out of control. 
I'm your father. I know. 
But if you keep this up, I'll be forced to go underground and lie, like every other teenager. 
Then you really won't be able to trust me. 
Is that what you want? God, no. 
Why is this happening? Nothing's 
happening. I'm just growing up. 
Well, stop. 
You were always the one I never had to worry about, but now... 
I have no idea how to do this. 
Your mom... 
There is no parent's handbook. 
I just made that up. Really? 
Dad, you're a great father. 
You've raised me well. 
I'm not going to surround myself with shady people. 
You said yourself you don't even know this guy. 
I don't. But if I learn he's bad news, 
he's gone. I promise you. 
I'm still not happy. 
That dinner was scary. 
You're telling me. I made a ham. 
Want to watch the game? 
English Version By ISUBS.COIL.US.TO TEAM  
Things I Hate About You... 
You betrayed me. 
It's not personal. It's just politics. 
I'm on The Biggest Poser. 
I leave for New York tomorrow! 
The only thing the show's going to change is my address, not the way I feel about you. 
I thought we both wanted to do this. 
Just because I want to have sex doesn't mean I should. 
We had a huge fight. I think it's over. 
I'm glad I caught you before you left for Nepal. 
He didn't try to stop me. 
Okay, let's review the details of our annual sexy carwash fundraiser. 
Are we sexy? Check. 
Have we bought soap, sponges, and buckets? 
Check. Have we made posters? 
Yep, Dawn's hard at work with the glitter gun. 
Have we approved Michelle's bikini? 
I refuse to repeat last year's wardrobe malfunction. 
Approved. We even did a stress test. 
You are so efficient and pleasant to deal with. I am sick of Michelle. 
I think it's time for a new vice head cheerleader, and her name is Bianca Stratford. 
Oh, my God, really? 
That would be a dream come true, page nine actually, but can you just do that? 
Thank God cheerleading isn't a democracy. 
The only opinion that matters is mine. 
You are my favorite dictator. 
Michelle. Chastity. Bianca. 
Michelle, Kaitlin. 
Bianca, Chastity. Okay, enough. 
Well, we should probably be getting to class. 
Okay. See you guys later. 
Bye. 
Bye. Bye. 
Did you see that? 
They stopped talking the second they saw us. 
Well, so did we... 
because we were talking about them. 
Oh, my God, do you think they heard about my promotion? 
It doesn't matter. 
They were already planning a coup d'?©tat 
the moment we walked up. 
Do they not realize who they're up against? 
I am this school's Tony Soprano. 
Bianca, oh, we are taking them down. 
Oh, yeah. 
Hi, I'm Kat Stratford. 
I'm a big fan of your university, huge, actually. 
Congratulations. 
Thanks. Would you like a prospectus? 
I've got one already. 
I like to flip through it and daydream, not in a sad, socially-maladjusted way. 
My mom went to Brown, and she always talked about how much she loved her time there. 
So you're a legacy. 
That improves your chances. 
No favoritism, please. I think I 
deserve admission on my own merits. 
Sir, William Blankenship. 
Allow me to cut to the chase. 
I know at most you'll accept one student from this school, and I would like to be that student. 
No, I would like to be that student. 
He would like to push my buttons. 
No, I would like to go to Brown. 
My mother went there. 
Best time of her life. 
Does that make me a lecy? 
We try not to view college admissions as a competition. 
Just so you know, I turned my car into a bio-diesel. 
I speak fluent Cantonese. 
I enacted Meatless Mondays. 
I'm student body president. 
He is not. We haven't even voted yet. 
I'm running unopposed. 
Not anymore. 
Translated By Mumy  Kat. 
Can you take down a few of your posters? 
There's not enough room on these walls for my posters, too. 
I know. 
It's hard when two such important events are going on at the same time. 
Why don't you just cancel your supe r-offensive sexy carwash? 
Because Dad's out of town. 
This may be my polka dot bikini's only chance to see the sun. 
Don't look now. It's Patrick. 
I don't care. 
I've moved on. 
Really, don't look unless you want to see Patrick looking super buff in his white T-shirt. 
All right, later. 
Hey. Hi. 
As you can see, I didn't go to Nepal. 
Bianca begged me not to. 
It was pathetic. 
So you're still a fellow inmate, huh? 
Yep, but I don't want us to have to avoid each other in the prison yard. 
Just because we broke up, doesn't mean we can't be civil. 
Don't worry. I won't shank you. 
Cool. 
Well, I hope I can count on your vote. 
Like I vote in these stupid elections. 
Michelle and that other girl whose name I can't remember are planning... 
They're planning something, aren't they? 
I'm sure they are, but they know we're friends. 
Getting any info is ...is going to be impossible. 
Being a mole is way harder than it looks. 
Huh. This isn't brain surgery. 
We just have to make them believe that we hate each other. 
Ooh-ooh, I have an idea. 
We stage a fake fight. 
You guys get into a big public brawl that totally ruptures your friendship. 
I don't know. 
After the fake intervention, we promised ourselves no more fake events. 
They always backfire. 
That's only because Joey was such a wild card. 
This is an inside job, so nothing can go wrong. 
Let's do it this afternoon at the sexy carwash. 
Yes. 
I finished the flyers. 
It was not easy finding recycled paper with a nice sheen. 
And I've worked up some talking points. 
It's a little bit of Hilary's smarts and a little bit of Sarah's "Aw, shucks" appeal. 
You guys rock. 
Imagine what this place could be like with smart women like us making the decision. 
Come to my victory toga beach party. 
Free food and, fingers crossed, swim suits optional. 
Your cover charge: the low-low price of a vote for Blank. 
Party! 
Party. Party. Party... 
Blank, Blank... 
Kat, lovely to see you, as always. 
You're so afraid of losing to me, you've resorted to buying votes. 
Remember, cheap theatrics can only take you so far. 
Just ask Howard Dean. 
Now you've hurt my feelings. 
You're still invited to my victory party. 
I think you would look smashing in a toga. 
Well, you don't, and I hope your deposit at the beach club is nonrefundable. 
Sexy carwash. 
Bianca, what do you think you're doing? 
I put you on tire duty. Hop to it. Now. 
These bottoms don't look cute when I crouch, Chastity, and stop shrieking. 
I can hear you. 
Oh, you were so much more obedient when you were the mascot. 
Maybe I should demote you. 
Now, get back to work. 
I want to be able to see my reflection in those hubcaps. 
No problem. They're the 
same height as your face. 
No, she didn't. 
You better check yourself, Olive Oyl, and next time, you should shop for a bikini in juniors. 
Hey, your ex-boyfriend Joey thinks my body is perfect. 
Oh, how would he know? 
It's not like he's ever seen it. 
She's a virgin. 
That's right, folks. 
She never slept with Mr. Ross. 
She made it up so that people would think she's cool. 
Dawn. 
Bianca, I'm sorry. I can't help myself. 
Chastity, I told you that in strictest confidence. 
Stay out of it, Kristi Yamaguchi. 
At least I'm not a slore who slept with Joey on the third date. 
Oh, and F-Y-I, he also said that you were so bad in bed that he faked it. 
*  Who's gonna bring the quiet day? *  
*  Black and blue, black and blue *  *  This is a war, it ain't no game *  *  Black and blue, black and blue *  Girl fight. Girl fight... 
*  Black and blue, black and blue *  *  Now that you know where you are *  *  You know that you're gonna lose *  That's it! You're off 
the squad for real. 
Okay, actually, Chastity, you were the one who crossed the line. 
You threw the first sponge, and when it comes to violence, this squad has a zero-tolerance policy. 
Which means we can kick you off with a unanimous vote. 
It was a sponge, not a grenade. Okay? 
You can't vote me off. 
I'm the captain, damn it. 
Girls, with a show of hands, how many of you feel threatened? 
You're out, Chastity. Good-bye. 
Yes. 
Is there a bruise? And a welt. 
And a red mark in the shape of a sponge. 
If it doesn't go away, I'm suing. 
You totally should. 
Maybe you could get her car. 
There's Joey. 
Joey, there's a drought on the tundra. 
You haven't had anything to eat in "veeks," so now you're going to be stalking Mr. 
Antelope. 
Get up. Got it. 
Is it okay if I crawl, you know, work the floor? 
Ya, ya, get down. 
Exactly, but remember to find your light, okay? 
I want to see "zee" hunger in your eyes. Okay? 
Und not so feral. 
Lyso "modelicious." 
Modelicious. 
Co'lliviette, you knew I wanted to rock the peacock. 
Sorry, but your face looks more like a horse, bitch. 
Who are you calling a bitch, bitch? 
Get out of my face, Zebra. 
Co'lliviette, come on. 
I hate how girls on reality shows are always so bitchy to each other. 
It makes me embarrassed to be a girl. 
I know. 
Until Co'lliviette accused Tia of stealing her trail mix, they were best friends. 
Dawn, be honest with me. 
Do you think I was a bitch to Chastity? 
Well, she was a bitch first. 
Yeah, but we were becoming real friends. 
I want to be a better person than Tia and Co'lliviette. 
And in conclusion, allow me to quote Mahatma Gandhi, who said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world. 
If you vote for me, Kat Stratford... 
I will be that change. 
Cut. Okay. 
Uh, yeah, that was terrible. 
I don't think even I can vote for you after that. 
I completely tuned out as soon as you... 
I get it. I sucked. 
You want them to like you. Try smiling. 
A smile isn't going to help, Gaia. 
It's that speech. 
It's boring and just pukey Hey, I killed myself writing that. 
It focus-grouped very well with Mr. 
Montcastle's homeroom. 
Give me this. 
Okay, now, why don't you just tell me why you want to run in your own words. 
I want to be president because I don't know. 
I want to beat Blank, and I want to get into Brown, and, well, the truth is every morning I wake up, and I think, "Who are these people? 
Why am I the only person who cares about anything that matters?" 
And then every morning I remember, they're idiots. 
They have teeny-tiny little pea brains that can only process information in the form of a tweet, a ring tone, or a status update, and if they're not going to think for themselves, they need someone like me to think for them. 
Yeah, that's not going to work either. 
Okay, I have an idea, but before you say no, just hear me out. 
How's your sense of rhythm? 
 *  My name is Kat Strizzy  I'm from the Midwest * *  Now I'm chillin' up in SoCal  With Padua's best *  *  Monday's to go meatless The misogynous speechless *  *  Save the naked morass All y'all gonna *  *  Gonna beat this They tried to search your lockers *  *  I led the insurrection Forget the police *  *  Send them to detention Vote     Kat Stratford *  *  It's about time To have a president *  *  Who speaks up for rights Vote Kat for prez *  Peace. I'm out. 
Can you believe they threw out my script and did this? 
It's vulgar. 
We're so going to win. 
No, we won't. 
This will show the entire school she hasn't got a stick up her bum right before they vote. 
I think you underestimate just how much people dislike her. 
No. It's over. 
She's won, and maybe she deserves to. 
Keep it together, Blank. 
You don't concede that easily unless you've been caught in an airport bathroom. 
Besides, you promised I'd be in charge of prom. 
Give it a rest, Tabitha. 
Hey, guys. 
Listen, things got a little crazy yesterday with the water and the sponges and the voting. 
I think we went too far. 
Since I'm the one Chastity hit, and I'm willing to forgive her, how about we just bring her back on the squad? 
Good idea, Bianca. 
Second chances are so inspiring. 
You're kidding, right? 
Chastity was really mean. 
And that's Brittany saying that. 
She's so nice it's nauseating. 
I'll admit Chastity can be a bitch, but if we punish her for that, then we become bitches, too. 
It's this horrible cycle that's often filmed for television. 
Last week she told me I had the ankles of a middle-aged man. 
Come on, guys, have a little compassion. 
Look, girls, I'm the new head cheerleader, and I say it's done. 
I'll do you a favor, and I'll try to forget this conversation ever happened, but it'll be tough. 
If you don't let Chastity back on the squad, then Dawn and I quit. 
Okay, bye. 
Bye. Bye. 
Oh, my God, we just quit cheerleading. 
Okay, okay, let's not panic. 
They'll never find replacements for all three of us before the game. 
They've got to come crawling back. 
Right. 
My story is America's story. 
I believe in America, and I believe in you, Padua High. 
Vote William Blankenship for Student Council President. 
See you at my victory toga beach party. 
Thank you for that stirring tribute to white immigration. 
And now our final candidate's video, after which you'll return to your homerooms and vote. 
Give it up for Kat Stratford. 
This ought to be good. 
Go, Kat. 
Yeah. Go, Kat. 
The truth is every morning I wake up and I think, "Who are these people? 
Why am I the only person who cares about anything that matters?" 
And then every morning I remember they're idiots. 
 They have teeny-tiny little pea brains. 
that can only process information in the form of a tweet, a ring tone, or a status update, and if they're not going to think for themselves, they need someone like me to think for them. 
This is not what we did. 
Kat. 
Please believe me when I tell you I had nothing to do with this. 
Right. 
You're welcome. 
Kat, wait. I don't 
want to talk about it. 
My poor sister and her big mouth. 
Yeah. Well, we got our own problems. 
Michelle has not begged us to come back yet. 
Trust me. She will. 
Just wait until they try to toss Kaitlin in the air. 
Ah, glad I found you two. 
Act nonchalant. 
Michelle, you look so cute. 
Thanks. I need your uniforms. 
We've got a game Friday, and the new girls need to get them fitted, so... 
New girls? 
Yeah, they're so great. 
Way less mouthy. Okay, toodles. 
Bica, what are we going to do? 
If I'm not a cheerleader, then who am I? 
There's Chastity. She'll have a plan. 
Chastity, look. 
I know you're upset with me, but so much has happened since our sponge fight yesterday. 
I realized our friendship means more to me than a stupid cheerleading uniform, so Dawn and I demanded that the squad take you back, and when Michelle said no, we quit in solidarity. 
Oh, that is so sweet. 
You're the best friend I've ever had, B, and you're my sixth best, Dawn, but I wish you would've checked with me first. 
Why? Look, 
the only reason I go to this crappy public school is because I'm head cheerleader, so I'm transferring to St. Augustine. 
Turns out their head cheerleader's in rehab, so there's an opening. 
But you can't just leave us. 
I will always be just a text away. 
Air hug. 
I'll miss you besty. 
But we just quit for you. 
You suck! 
Looks like you could use a ride home. 
All I ever wanted was to be popular, and now I've lost it for someone who gave me an air hug. 
I can't believe we're going to be unpopular. 
Cameron, what's it like? Is it horrible? 
No, there's a bunch of cool stuff about it. 
Really? Like what? 
Like, uh, you get lots of free time to hang out and play games with your friends, be they virtual or actual people. 
Uh-huh. Anything else? 
Well, your cell phone bill's a lot lower because the virtual people never call-- Shh. 
Okay, that's enough, sweetie. 
Dr. Stratford. 
Daddy, I thought you weren't coming back until tomorrow. 
There's nothing more boring than a bunch of gynecologists talking shop. 
I mean, how many conversations can you have about the cervix? 
Oh, and the vagina jokes. 
Ew, Dad. Gross. 
Oh, tell me one. 
Sorry, forget where I was. 
Where's your sister? 
She's upstairs. 
She had a rough day and could probably use a hug. 
Tell you one later. 
Um, Bianca, you should watch this. 
Co'lliviette, are you okay? 
I'm just thinking about my baby. 
You really misher. 
Yeah. 
I love her so much. 
I'm just afraid she, you know, wrecked my body. 
Seriously, no. 
No, you don't look like you had a baby at all. 
Yes, I do. 
Look at my stomach. 
It's, like, totally flat. 
No. Touch it. It's cushy. 
No, it's not. 
Well, that was fun. 
This is like a new record for us. 
We haven't gotten in one single fight. 
You see, this is what the world needs more sex, less war. 
Now, if that had been your campaign slogan, you would've won. 
Can I ask you a favor? 
Don't break my heart. Okay? 
Okay. 
Can I ask you a favor? 
What is it? 
I hear someone can use a hug. 
I'm not leaving.
