Guess what, you guys, I got a new job. 
Another job? Where? 
 At Gungho videos. 
My command of the vernacular impressed both Mr. Gung 
and Mr. Ho. 
Congratulations, Harry. 
 Good for you, Harry. 
It's freezing out here. 
Dick, can we go inside now? 
No, we're here to experience everything on this planet, even the uncomfortable parts. 
I have some very uncomfortable parts. 
They said on the news that the dew point is dropping. 
What does that mean? 
 I don't know. 
It just caught my attention ' cause it sounded kind of dirty. 
Why do humans spend so much time worrying about the weather? 
They can't go 15 minutes without getting an update. 
Don't these people have windows? 
I cannot do a book report out here Dick, my fingers are going numb. 
Can we please go inside now? 
Absolutely not, this is research. No one goes 
in without a damn good reason. 
Does anyone remember what color our napkins are? 
I think we should go check. 
let's go find out. 
Whew! I am freezing. 
 Why don't you wear a longer skirt? 
With these legs? 
I don't think so. 
Did you pick up my tickets? 
Yes, and your reservation for your hotel in Chicago. There's your itinerary. 
Nina, I can't believe this is happening to me. 
Not every anthropologist receives this kind of honour. 
I've worked my entire life for this award I know, the Louis Leakey award. 
To stand in front of a conference of educators and express my thoughts about my work. 
This is going to be the best weekend of my life. 
Why are you looking at me that way? 
 No reason. 
Dr. Albright! 
Dr. Albright! 
Guess what. 
You and I are on the same flight. 
Same row, side by side, strapped in at 38,000 feet. 
Isn't that great? 
Why are you going to the conference? 
They're giving me some kind of academic award. 
They hand these things out like candy mints. 
Once we get that out of the way, the two of us get to experience the magic that is Chicago. 
Well, once again something wonderful in my life has been turned into a giant crap fest. 
What's the matter? 
You! 
I guess she's just saving up her excitement for the crap fest. 
You just don't get it, do you? 
 What do you mean? 
There are people who have stress and people who give stress, and you... are a giver. 
 That's nonsense. 
Dr. Solomon? 
Well, come in, Leon. 
Come in, come in, come in, all the way in. 
Can I have the weekend to turn in my paper? 
Leon, do you find that I cause you stress? 
Did someone say I said that? 
 No. 
It was all a misunderstanding. I love physics. 
I find it very soothing. I 
don't know what you've heard. 
Please don't fail me. I'll 
turn the paper in by Friday. 
That was a stress reaction, wasn't it? 
 Yes, it was. 
Thank you, Nina. 
You've opened my eyes. 
I'm going to make sure that Dr. Albright's weekend 
is stress-free, hassle-Free, and completely without unpleasantness. 
Oh, you're not going? 
Oh, Tommy. What are 
you doing here? 
I thought you had that book report due on dickens. 
I was doing it, and it was so boring. 
I realized I could save myself a lot of work if I just watched the movie. 
I can't believe no kid ever thought of this before. 
I'll help you as soon as I'm done reorganizing this place. 
Why? What was wrong with it? 
 It was a mess. 
Everything was just lumped together. 
You know, all the "A's," all the "B's." 
26 unrelated categories, except for "x" which has its own room. 
Well, how does it work now? 
Things are much simpler now. Look. 
Good movies. 
Bad movies. 
Movies I haven't seen. 
Pardon me, where could I find "aliens"? 
Nowhere. 
Not here, that's for sure. 
Nobody here but us humans. 
Stop looking at me! 
Do you really think this trip is such a good idea? 
Chicago's really far, and I saw on TV something about a... 
..low pressure front moving in. 
 Low pressure? 
That's exactly what Dr. Albright needs. 
Ah, there she is now. 
This doesn't feel right to me, Dick. 
Separating from the unit for an entire weekend is madness. 
As first officer in charge of security, I forbid it. 
I'm high commander, and I'm going. 
Come on, why? 
 Lieutenant, don't worry. 
I'm prepared for every eventuality. 
I think you're taking this far too lightly. 
You've never travelled here before. How do you know what to pack? 
How will I reach you in Chicago? 
 I'm taking the phone. 
You know the number. 
Why are you taking refrigerator magnets? 
Chicago, the windy city? 
I think it's obvious. 
What do you mean? 
Let's say an urgent message comes in for Dr. Albright, 
and she's out sightseeing. 
I lay it on the nightstand because I have no way of securing it to a metallic surface. 
A gust of wind blows it under the bed, and Mary never discovers her long-lost identical twin, all for want of a magnetic banana. 
That's exactly the kind of needless agitation that I intend to prevent. 
Understood. 
Travel well, commander. 
I shall return. 
What are you doing? 
I'm entering the pod. 
For god's sakes, just sit down and behave yourself. 
Of course I will, Mary. 
Here I am, sitting. 
You just be calm. 
Take a deep breath. 
Welcome to Northview Airlines Flight 604 to Chicago. 
Oh, my god! 
Out there! 
There's something on the wing! 
It's an engine! 
 This thing is a deathtrap! 
Sky waitress! 
Sky waitress! 
Please be quiet during safety procedures. 
Safety? On this flying 
donkey cart? That's rich. 
How can this woman stay calm when, at any second, we could go careening out of the sky in a flaming heap of twisted metal? 
Sir, everything is going to be.. 
 At least give her a gelatin-filled helmet to keep her brain intact. 
She's receiving an award! 
Please sit down. 
 No! 
We're getting off! 
Who's with me? 
I've never been kicked off a plane before. 
Be grateful it was still on the ground. 
You could of least told me you were afraid to fly. 
 Only on airplanes. 
Instead of a 45-minute flight, I have a seven-hour drive. 
Don't worry. I've anticipated your needs, 
and I'm ready to fill the remaining six hours and 50 minutes with mirth and merriment. 
I brought "mad libs." 
I need the name of someone in the room. 
Dick. 
 Dick. 
This is funny already Look, it's starting to snow. 
Oh, my god. 
What's the matter, haven't you ever seen a snowflake before? 
Yes, and I prayed I'd never see them again. 
Turn on the high beams. 
They fear the light. 
Where can I find "remains of the day"? 
Oh, that would be in the "I didn't see it" section. 
Wow, I've finally found what I was looking for.. 
"David Copperfield." 
It doesn't look boring. 
He saws himself in half and makes the statue of liberty disappear. 
Hey, look out the window. 
They're here! 
They're here! 
Albino brain chiggers! 
Cover your ears! 
Harry! Harry! 
It's snow! Snow. 
Oh. 
 I learned it in science class. 
Come on outside with me and I'll show you how to write your name in it. 
Oh, my god. 
It's covering everything. 
The whole town is being obliterated. 
I'm up here. 
I'm up here! 
Uh... okay, I know 
the term paper's late, but my car wouldn't st.. 
 Who cares? You're alive. 
You're alive. 
Who are you? 
Oh, I-I'm a student of Dr. 
Solomon's. My name's Leon. 
I'm a sister of Dr. 
Solomon's. My name's Sally. 
Yeah, I know. 
I saw you one day when you dropped off his lunch. 
And then you went to the dry cleaners, and then to the shoe repair place, and then the car wash. 
And then you went home and read a book by the window for three hours. 
 I remember that day. 
Listen, Leon, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think the earth is spiraling out of the sun's orbit and we're heading for a new ice age. 
Uh... did they say 
that on the news? 
No, but trust me, I've seen this happen before. 
We could be the last two creatures on earth. 
 I don't know about that. 
Our first responsibility is to breed. 
We must, must copulate as much as we can. 
Well, now that you mention it, I didn't see any people on the way over. 
Damn! 
How are we supposed to do it with the lights out? 
A boy like that will kill your brother forget that boy and find another one of your own kind, stick to your own kind a boy who kills cannot love a boy who kills has no heart and he's a boy who has no heart, very smart oh, no, Anita, no, you should know.. ? 
 Oh, my god. 
Fear has made you hysterical. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
I just like to sing show tunes on long trips. 
Before I found anthropology, I was going to be a theater major. 
Did I ever tell you why I became a teacher? 
I don't think this is the best time.. 
 Like all little girls, I had a thing for neolithic archeology. 
My father used to cut up my barbies and bury the pieces in the backyard so I could discover them. 
Only problem was, on my first dig I discovered I was afraid of skeletons. 
Boy, it's really coming down now. 
 Poor, sweet, tiny Mary. 
You can drop the brave front. 
We're under attack. Pull over. 
What? 
 I'm commandeering this car. 
Oh no, you're not. 
 It's a fullscale invasion! 
I'll save you! 
Are you getting the feeling back in your hands? 
No. 
 Well, the walk wasn't too bad. 
Oh, yeah, the last four miles just flew by. 
You plowed my car into a snow bank. 
I know. 
And we thought it was going to fight back. Aren't we silly? 
If anything is wrong with that car, I am holding you responsible. 
We've got to stick together. 
The roads are closed. 
And look around. 
We're surrounded by Neanderthals. 
That's a fair assessment, isn't it, fellas? 
Are you all right, honey? 
Yes, I'm fine, thank you. 
You know, your boyfriend's kind of cute. 
Him? 
 The way he spent the last hour knocking himself out trying to get your attention. 
 He's an idiot. 
Honey, they're all idiots, but this one is looking at you like you're the only woman on the planet. 
Although you're real pretty, you're not exactly the last ham sandwich in hungry town, if you get my drift. 
Yes? It did? 
Oh, my god. 
Where? 
And you're sure? 
Thank you. 
Mary. 
 Hmm? 
That plane that I got us thrown off of... 
 Yes? 
It never reached Chicago. 
Oh, my god! 
Oh, my god! Oh! 
Yes, the airport was closed, and they were diverted to Gary, Indiana. 
Gary is 20 minutes from Chicago. 
Well, but it's an inconvenience nonetheless. 
I think someone owes me an apology. 
Okay, here are our rations.. 
tuna salad on whole wheat. 
Sorry, all we have to drink is this giant bottle of wine. 
It has a modest bouquet, but I think you'll be amused by its presumptuousness. 
Whatever. 
Well, Leon, to the survival of the species. 
 Oh, hmm, yes. 
Why are you nervous? 
 Well, it's just that I've never been with a woman of your... 
good-lookingness before. 
Yeah, I know, I'm hot. 
It's kind of exciting for me, too. 
All the men I've met have been strong and decisive, and you're neither of those things. 
Well, I can be, maybe. 
Probably not. 
Oh, Leon, think what our offspring will be like. 
They'll have my skills as a warrior and your fierce intelligence. 
Dr. Solomon doesn't talk 
much about me, does he? 
I think you're just trying too hard. 
It's exhausting. 
Nothing I do is right. 
and believe me I do everything. 
You see, that's your first mistake, you see what I'm saying? Women 
don't want you to do everything. 
According to who? 
Oprah. 
Yeah, Oprah. 
 So what do I do? 
Well, you want to give her what she wants when she needs it. 
And you've got to try and understand it when she needs her freedom to want what she needs. 
Yeah, and if she's free to want it when she needs it or not. 
You see what we're Sayin'? 
 Yeah. 
What a man needs to do is this. 
You have got to pay attention to what she likes and share it with her. 
You see what he's saying? 
 You see what I'm saying? 
You see what we're saying? 
 Yeah, uhhuh, I see what you're saying. 
But what does she like? 
Oh, oh, oh! 
I know the perfect thing. 
No, she hates that. 
Ooh, I know! 
No, that made her throw up. 
It's hard, isn't it? 
 It is damn hard. 
Oh-hhh... 
...klahoma where the wind 
comes sweeping down the plain don't even try it. 
And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet when the wind comes right behind the rain oh-hhh-klahoma every night my honey lamb and I sit alone and talk and watch the hawk making lazy circles in the sky we know we belong to the land and the land we belong to is grand yippee-yi, yippee-Yay, yippee-yay and when we say, yeow! 
Ayipioeeay, yeow! 
We're only Sayin', you're doing fine Oklahoma Oklahoma o-k-l-a-h-o-m-a Okla-hooo... 
ma! 
Yay! 
I don't know why I was so afraid of the snow. 
It's actually quite beautiful. 
You know that slush down in the gutter? 
You call me crazy, but you put a little cherry syrup on that, you got yourself a cool, refreshing treat. 
Here, listen to this. 
"Charles dickens' 'David Copperfield' is an extraordinary book about a man who accomplishes many incredible feats involving Claudia schiffer handcuffed in an underwater tank with sharks." 
That's good. 
 Where are all the tapes? 
Well, we had a big night, but fear not. 
We still got five copies of "johnny mnemonic. 
If that's not your cup of tea, we've also got "the making of johnny mnemonic." 
How about adult movies? 
We got "fat Fr�uleins." 
"A lusty romp through the cheese and sausage shops of communist east Berlin." 
Forget it. 
All right, give it to me. 
So then Freddy stivender beat the crap out of me. 
It was the talk of the school. 
I was so embarrassed. 
But after weeks of plotting, I got my revenge. 
 What did you do? 
I had my mom tell his mom. 
I like your tactics. 
You know, it may just be the wine talking, but I'm beginning to think in a crazy world like this, you and me just might make sense. 
Hey, lights! 
They'll be out again in a second, if there's a god in heaven. 
People are outside shoveling snow. 
We're not the last people alive on earth. 
Leon, now we don't have to sacrifice ourselves. 
You don't have to impregnate me! 
Uh... oh, good. 
Not to mention the ominous behavioral parallels between Australopithecus, euralopithecus... 
this is stupid. 
 No! No, it's not. 
So in accepting this award, I must pose the question, "has our journey from primate to man finally concluded, or has it just begun?" 
Wonderful, wonderful Yes! 
Excuse me, Dick, but that road has been cleared for a good half hour out there. 
Be all right if we just scoot on out of here? 
Sure. Sure. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
Ma'am, I surely am sorry you didn't get to pick up your Leakey award. 
Oh, Dick, I feel I owe you a thank you. 
You certainly made the time pass. 
I can't blame the weather on you. Well, I could, 
but I won't. 
Sometimes things just don't work out. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
Sometimes on the way to what's supposed to happen something even better happens, which is why I am pleased to present you with this orb containing a diorama of the city of Chicago in a state of perpetual blizzard. 
It's remarkable, isn't it? 
 Yes, it is. 
And I have something for you. 
 You do? 
The crimson shovel. 
 Oh, thank you. 
Let's go dig out the car. 
 Absolutely. 
It should be easy to find. 
I left the lights on. 
Aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
And...well, they had an extra seat. 
The world is actually two thirds water. 
About the equivalent of Scotch at a cheap wedding. 
Super combo number one. 
Super combo number four. 
And the fun-tastic goofy meal number two. 
You heard me. 
Earth just doesn't get any better than this.. dinner and a movie. 
Mmm. Ooh, 
let's see this one. 
Four stars, two thumbs. "A sweeping 
drama, one of the years". 
most intellectually stimulating cinematic accomplishments." 
No. 
 Chick flick. 
How are your chicken crunchies today? 
Harry, we don't have all day. 
He'll have the super combo number two. 
Okay, that'Il be $10 .71. Please drive around. 
Ah, with pleasure. 
What's that sound? 
Please drive around. 
 Yeah, we would if we could. 
I told you to get this looked at two weeks ago, not to mention the phone's still out. 
I keep telling you to get all these things taken care of, yet nothing ever gets done. 
And yet you persist. 
Good for you. 
Now we'll never make it to the movie. 
Nonsense, All we have to do is get out and push, Sally. - Yeah, yeah. 
Hurry up, I don't want to miss the previews. 
Or that "audiences' listening" thing. 
This seat sucks. Oh I agree, 
the seating is all wrong. 
Tommy, you should be to my right so I could actually have an armrest. 
Harry, you should sit on the aisle because you go to the bathroom constantly. 
Wait a minute, hold it. 
Everybody just sit down. 
This is supposed to be fun. 
Here, Sally, have some popcorn. 
I didn't want popcorn. 
I wanted good and plentys. 
Well, when you're high commander, you can be in charge of the movie treats. 
I will. 
 Bully for you. 
Shh! 
 Excuse me, we're talking here! 
Now, how did he beat those guys? 
I mean, come on, it was 12 against one. 
Well, he has the advantage. 
They only have machine guns, while he has the broken pool cue. 
Oh! Oh, great 
command decision, Dick, now I have a piece of popcorn stuck in my teeth. 
I'll get it. 
Sally, you are right. I 
should have sat near the aisle. 
Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
Excuse me, excuse me. 
Is that it? 
 Ow! 
I'm getting the manager. 
 Thank you. Have him bring floss. 
I'm sorry. 
Couldn't be sorr...Ow ! 
Dick, I'm stuck to the floor. 
Oh my god! 
Okay, punk, court is adjourned...YAH ! 
Stop it. 
That's an order. 
The high commander said that I could turn myself into a lethal killing machine. 
Did you? 
 What? 
Tommy, what's with the toad? 
His name is Jack. 
He's my new lab partner. 
 No, I meant in the jar. 
Oh! That's a dead frog. 
We're going to reanimate it. 
Tommy, I thought I told you no science projects in the kitchen. 
High commander said we could. 
Dick, permission to bitch? 
 Permission granted. 
Why do you tell them they can do things when I tell them they can't? 
Because I'm the high commander. 
Well, would it kill you to listen to me once...aahhhh! 
ahhhhhh...I'm sorry, I thought we were singing. 
This popcorn kernel is agony. 
I feel like sticking my head in a microwave to pop it out. 
Just make sure that you poke holes in your head with a fork first. 
Well, I'm off. 
 Dick wait, we need to talk about this. 
I am second in command here, and I have no authority over these guys. 
You outrank them Sally, just seize control, take some initiative. 
All right, permission requested to schedule initiative-taking. 
Just do it. Take the car and fix the phone. 
What would you do if I wasn't here? 
 You're always here. 
Well, what if I wasn't? 
I'd do a happy little dance. 
Oh, man, Solomon's here. 
Don't look, he might come over. 
 Does he see us? 
I'll check. 
Leon! What 
a happy accident. 
Now we can spend the evening getting to know each other better. 
Ah please, continue with your conversation. 
We can't. We were talking about you. 
Shut up. 
Can I get you something? 
 What are they having? 
Coffee, for two hours. 
I'll have that. 
Pitman... 
 What? 
You look different. 
I don't know what it is. 
Suddenly you look so I've never used this word.....cool. 
Really? I've been... - now it's gone. 
Now it's back. 
Now there's an air of sophistication. 
Somehow that fiery tube has mitigated your oafishness. 
May I? 
 Oh. 
oh you can keep it. 
Thank you. 
Oh.....an added bonus. 
This is creepy. 
You have no vision. 
What is this thing in my colander? 
Oh, that would be its old brain. 
Well, Dick,my life is hell. 
I hope you're happy. 
Oh, you betcha.  It's like I'm feeling 
my lungs for the first time. 
It's so nice to have a tenant who smokes. 
So many people are giving it up. It just breaks my heart. 
We need some duct tape and jumper cables. 
Tommy, have you smoked your cigarette yet? 
Er, no, sir. 
 There's no reason to put it off. 
You know, I must say, this secondhand smoke, is smooth and satisfying. 
My gift to you. 
Dick, you've been smoking those things since you got home. 
It's almost like they're addictive. 
 Don't be silly. 
If cigarettes were bad, they wouldn't sell them everywhere. 
Besides, I can quit whenever I want. 
There, you see, I've stopped. 
There's nothing to it. 
You know, Sally, if you want to advance, you're going to have to open your mind to new experiences. 
Well, I've started again. 
This popcorn kernel is driving me crazy. 
Oh honey, don't put your hand in your mouth. 
It's so unbecoming. 
What was that? 
It's alive! 
Hey, what's your problem? 
It's a guaranteed "A."...Kids? 
What do you think you're doing? 
 Smoking. 
Please don't smoke in front of me. I just quit a year ago. 
Oh, you poor, misguided girl. 
Don't you miss it? 
The first cool drag in the morning, a relaxing smoke on the roof on a warm summer night. 
And if I ever have sex, I think I'm going to smoke afterwards. 
Have you ever read the warning on the side of the pack? 
Well, I'm not a fetus. 
Those things will take 10 years off of your life. 
Yes, but that's off the end of your life, and those years are crappy anyway. 
Well, there happens to be a policy here.. 
cigarettes are only allowed in university-Sanctioned smoking zones. 
Take it outside. 
All right, if you're going to be a big...fetus about it. 
My people.  Dr. Finkel. 
Father. 
Mrs. Cross, 
you smoke, too? 
It comes as a surprise to many people. 
Look at us...we suck, we blow.. 
a posse of oral fixators. 
Oh, yeah, we're bad. 
They can isolate us, but they'll never separate us. 
Let them outlaw smoking. 
Then they'll just have to deal with a whole bunch of... 
smokin' outlaws! 
Who's with me? 
All right. 
All right, rinse out your mouth. 
Now spit. 
You've never been to a... 
dentist's office before, have you? 
Well, you know, gal on the go. 
All right. Could you 
open wider, please?  Wider. 
You can't smoke in here. 
All right, I'll smoke in the waiting room. 
Er, you can't smoke in the waiting room, either. 
Then I'll smoke in the hall. 
I'm sorry, you can't smoke anywhere in the building. 
You know, you're awfully smug for a man in a paper coat. 
Oh, yes! 
The corn is gone. See? 
So, Tommy, how was your science fair? 
Oh, uh... 
funny story. Um... 
remember that frog I reanimated? 
Well, it kind of developed a taste for human flesh. 
Someone's got to go see my science teacher tomorrow. 
Well did you tell Dick? 
 I thought he was with you. 
He ran off. That was hours ago. 
 That's not like him. 
Well, what are we supposed to do? Dick is always here. 
Wait a minute. 
Of course...this is a test. 
What? 
 For the next 60 seconds, she's going to emit a high-pitched tone. 
No. 
Dick is testing me. 
He's conveniently "disappeared,"  leaving me in charge. 
Well, I'm gonna show him. 
Okay, troops, line up in order of height. 
Descending. 
It's time for decisive action. 
Harry! 
 Yes, sir ma'am ma'am ma'am sir. 
You're going to climb the utility pole and fix our phone line. 
Ohh, well, I'll need a flashlight. 
Don't worry. It's plenty 
bright with all that lightning. 
Well, how do I get up there? 
We've got that big metal ladder in the garage. 
Oh, wait. 
You can knock the box open with this metal golf club. 
 Good, Tommy. 
Oh and you want to be safe. Wrap 
this chain around your waist and attach it to the power line in case you slip. 
Prepare to be dazzled. 
Oh, well... 
I'm sure someone will find me before the building closes. 
Maybe not. 
Now, I'm not one to discourage a child's creativity, but that frog took a bite out of Patti kinland the size of a silver dollar. 
Dime, tops. 
 That frog destroyed all the other experiments and attacked six students, and Tommy refuses to apologize. 
Well, it's clear that Tommy must be disciplined. 
And in the absence of Mr. Solomon, 
we ask that you take responsibility. 
Oh, I'm ready to take responsibility. 
Believe me, I can handle responsibility. No problem. 
Tommy, I'm hereby placing you under house arrest. 
Well I just thought counseling  Your rations will be cut in half. 
You will report to calisthenics at 0500, sharp. 
Could I be placed in a foster home or something? 
I'm his mother. 
I'll handle him. 
I thought you were his sister. 
 Sister, mother, whatever. 
I think you're actually my aunt. 
In our family, it's kind of hard to tell. 
Oh, Danny boy the pipes,the pipes are calling from glen to glen and down the mountainside the summer's gone and all the roses falling 'tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide but come ye back when summer's in the meadow hey, you're not bad. 
Thank you. 
'Tis I'll be gone in sunshine or in shadow. 
You're not so bad yourself. 
What do you mean my cars' not ready? You promised it by Friday. 
Today's Friday. 
The carburetors' a rebuild, that takes extra time. 
 I'm over here. 
On the plus side, your tranny's in really good shape. 
Ah, good news. 
Excuse me, this is my car. 
Uh, she's right. 
I just stand here and nod. 
Well, you gotta humor 'em. 
This redhead came in last week. 
I think she was driving a sunbird. She opened that hood.. 
hello... I'd like my car ready 
in a half hour. 
I don't want a 200% mark-Up on parts. 
And I'd like it washed. 
Thank you. Do you hear that, high commander? 
Sally? 
Oh, yeah. 
I'm sorry. 
Women, huh? 
Oh, boy. 
Dick? 
 Sally. 
Dick, you can come out now. 
I've passed your little test. 
Nina, where's Dick? 
I haven't seen him in two days, I was just about to call you. 
Will you excuse us for just a minute? 
He's not here, he's gone. 
He's actually gone. 
I can still hear you. 
Could you leave, please? 
 Try and stop me. 
This wasn't a test. 
I really am high commander. 
We await your orders, high commander. 
We're here waitin'. 
If Dick were here, he'd know what to do. 
If Dick were here, he'd know where he was. 
We gotta find him. 
Dr. Bankson. 
Dr. Bankson,.... 
we meet at last. 
I'm looking for someone... 
Dick Solomon? 
Who the heck are you? 
 Ah. 
Looks like you've chosen a poor time to sedate yourself, Dr. Bankson. 
But you know what they say.. 
the dentist who drills his own teeth, has a fool for a patient. 
Ah, I didn't expect you to cooperate. 
Well, maybe you'll talk... 
for Mr Sucky thing. 
Death has reared himself a throne, in a strange city lying alone. 
Where good and bad and worst and best, are gone to their eternal rest. 
That's nice. 
What is it? 
It's just... 
something I made up. 
Liar. That's Edgar Allan Poe. 
I was there when you read it. 
Then why ask?! Just to play 
mind games with me? 
What mind? Stop it! Stop it! 
Stop it, stop it, stop it! 
Dick, is that you? 
Harry? 
 Dick? 
Harry, open the door! 
Open the door! 
How do I know it's really you? 
It's really me! 
 Well, you would know that. 
Harry! - Dick! 
You saved me! 
God, when I think of all the times... 
Oh I'm so glad.. 
A voice inside of you? 
And you never knew it was there before? 
By the second day, I was hearing my inner voice, too. 
What was it saying? 
I have no idea. 
I don't speak French. 
You should have seen the janitor's face, when he walked in on the four of us. 
I'm just glad you're alive. 
Thank you, Sally. 
And good work finding me. 
Good work? 
I was paralyzed. I 
thought I could do your job. 
You're so arrogant, bossy, and condescending, you make it look so easy. 
Well, I'm not perfect, lieutenant. 
After all, I got locked in a stairwell for three days, just because I needed a cigarette. 
Yeah, that was stupid. 
 Yes, it was. 
Really stupid. 
Point taken. 
I mean, didn't you even think to check the door first? 
You'd expect a bonehead move like that from me, but you? 
Okay, a bonehead is where I draw the line. 
Excuse us. 
 After all, I am the high commander. 
oh, well... 
 Whooooh! 
As many intelligent people know, aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in, they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
and...well, they had an extra seat. 
The people of Earth sometimes divide against each other, based on national origin or skin colour. 
Of course no-one else in the Galaxy, can tell them apart. 
Oh, I've been there and there, and I've been there. 
Wow! The long, boring 
stories you must have. 
Well I have another destination for you, Tommy.... high school. 
Why? I finished 
my education, when you were nothing but a snot-nosed gas ball. 
Hey that sounds like a very dangerous assignment Dick. 
Shouldn't I take that on? 
 No. We have to try to assume, 
the roles of a regular human family. 
Since Tommy's the adolescent, he'll have to go to school. 
And you will explore the lifestyle of a young adult woman. 
And I, as the benevolent father figure, will provide the major source of income, and give you cute nicknames. 
Dick? 
 What is it, kitten? 
What's my role in the family? 
Harry, we have been through this. 
You're the brother who tries hard, but still doesn't have the nerve to move out on his own. 
But we love your pluck and determination. 
But I can do more. 
You see? That's the pluck that we love. 
Now, let's just be the warm human family that we are. 
After you. 
 Why are you doing that? 
Well, I've seen men do it all the time. 
Apparently, women don't know how to operate doors. 
Well, I do. 
Oh, Dick, I've thought of a job for myself. 
I can catalog the dangers, that surround us on this planet. 
For example, getting your fingers crushed in a car door. 
Ow. 
Ow. Ow. 
Why are you listening to the serpent? 
Don't eat the fruit. 
Don't eat the fruit ! 
Women. 
Dean Sumner's office called. 
You parked in his space. 
I know. It's so much 
closer than mine. 
Move it, lady! 
 And your sister's here. 
Sally, I thought I left you at home. 
 You forgot your shoes. 
Hey, what's with the guy in 114? 
Every time I walk by, he follows me and talks to me. 
I think somebody has an admirer. 
Great. Now can we 
talk about me? 
Sally, are you seeing anyone now? 
I'm looking at you, aren't I? 
For god's sakes, he's trying to ask you on a date. 
A date. 
It's a perfect opportunity. 
You'll go. 
 No, I won't. 
Trust me, I know what's best. 
Why are you treating me like this? 
Like what? - Like this? This? 
There! you just did it. 
I don't know what I'm doing. 
You're acting as if I can't make decisions for myself. 
I am second in command. 
One of us has to experience sex, and I'm getting nowhere with her. 
Well, why didn't you say so? 
If sex is so important, you and I could do it right here on the desk, get it out of the way. 
Okay. 
I'll leave you clampetts alone to your banjo lesson. 
When beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles, and the bottle's in a poodle and the poodle's eating noodles, they call this a muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle." 
This man is a genius. 
Well, if it isn't our proud little student. 
What did you learn on your first day? 
I'm wearing the wrong kind of sneakers, and girls only like seniors. 
And, man, you can't compliment anybody in the shower. 
You see, and you thought you knew everything. 
Sally, you're going to be late for your date! 
I just don't know what to wear! 
Is this appropriate?. 
Come on, men. 
What do I even do on a date? 
Oh, I've been reading about it. 
I'll walk you through it. 
Yeah yeah I'll be your date. 
 You're not doing anything, until you've done your homework, old man. 
Oh, so you guys get to talk about sex, while I make an Aztec village out of macaroni? 
This is fair. 
Okay, Harry, you're brad, and the two of you are at a romantic restaurant. 
Here. 
Okay, now go ahead. 
I don't know what to do. 
Gaze into his eyes the way Dr. Albright 
gazes into mine. 
You know... 
That's perfect. 
Now, break the ice by telling him something personal about yourself. 
Well, uh, brad... 
once every lunar cycle, my uterine lining sloughs itself, thereby.. 
whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Oh, oh! 
That may be too personal. 
It does. 
One minute, I'm fine.. 
..and the next, my uterus starts throbbing.. 
 Hey! 
You know, there is something to be said for keeping.. 
some mystery in a relationship. 
When do I get to touch your breasts? 
Right before you die. 
Fair enough. 
Ow, ow, ow, ow. 
Rainbows, daisies, snowflakes, that girl. 
My boys. 
She's swallowed a tiny monkey. 
So, lieutenant, give us a full report on your assignment. 
He was wonderful. 
He thinks I'm wonderful. 
He asked me where I'd been all his life. 
You didn't tell him? 
 All the coordinates. 
Thank goodness he didn't believe me, so I didn't have to kill him. 
What happened after dinner? 
 Well, he wanted to sleep with me. 
I wanted sex, but since he was tired I let him go home.- Damn. 
But... 
the good news is... 
he's gonna call me. 
I wish I could meet a guy like that. 
Come on, sport, I'll drive you to school. 
Bite me. 
 Bite me, what? 
Bite me, daddy. 
That's better. 
See you tonight, slugger. 
No, you won't 'cause I'll be out with brad, having fun. 
All right, good job. 
Come on. Let's keep it moving, Solomon. 
Climb the rope. 
 Yeah. What's at the top of the rope? 
Your self-respect is at the top of the rope. 
Run this by me again. 
I climb up there, and then I...? 
You climb down! 
And this gives me self-Respect because...? 
Okay, look, you don't want to climb the rope, you can go sit over there with the girls. 
So, if I don't climb the rope, then I sit with the girls. 
 That's right. 
Now help me out here 'cause I'm not seeing the downside. 
Must you make such a racket?! 
Okay, you've bossed me around for the last time. 
Oh, I'm sorry I blew up like that. 
There he is. 
There he is. 
There he is. 
You know, what goes on outside this office is really none of my business. 
 There he is. 
Just because I set Sally up with brad doesn't mean you're under any obligation to tell me how it went. 
There he is. 
 I'm not even curious. 
Mm-hmm, right there. 
Sally's date? 
Start talking. 
Well, what can I say? In her 
own words, it was wonderful. 
mm-hmm. 
 She overate, and he found her charming. 
Mm-hmm. 
 In fact, he's going to call her. 
Hmmm. 
What? 
Orange juice. 
Ahhh! Nontoxic. 
Tabasco. 
Ahhh! Also nontoxic. 
He said he'd call. 
 Yes, I know. 
He promised. 
He said he'd call. 
That changes everything. 
 I can take more pain than the rest of you put together , but right now I just feel so... 
icky. 
Damn it, Dick, give me some pain I can define. 
I am not going to jam your hand in the toaster again. 
You just can't imagine what it feels like, Dick. 
It's like he reached in, pulled all the bones out of my body. 
My god! 
What are you doing? 
Apparently, I'm leaking. 
Well, stop it! 
All right, commander. 
Wine cooler. 
Ahhh! I could go 
either way. 
Lieutenant, we need to talk. 
This is all your fault. I didn't 
want to be the woman. 
You made me be the woman. 
You're a decorated veteran. 
I thought you could handle it. 
Well, I can't. 
This is hard. 
Please, don't. 
No no, Please don't. 
It went so great. 
Brad said he liked me. 
Why won't he phone? 
There, there. 
Maybe he can't call. 
Maybe his phone is out. 
Maybe he injured himself running with scissors or used a dry cleaning bag as a toy. 
Dick... 
I've lost all feeling in the left side of my body. 
Could somebody please call 1-1-6? 
Do not touch that phone! 
Oh, dad! 
 Now what is it? 
My teachers want to talk to you about my attitude, as if I have an attitude. 
This is just perfect. 
I try to mold us into a family that will blend in, and what do I get? 
A surly teenager, a sister obsessed with a man, and a brother who drinks too much. 
Is there another family in the whole world like this? 
I don't think so. 
Frankly, I can't take it anymore. 
Me neither I'm outta here. 
I have got to find out what happened to brad. 
"Induce vomiting". 
There's an idea. 
If anybody needs me, I'll be in the garage... 
putting up peg board. 
Hello, brad. 
 Sally. 
I've come to check your phone. 
Sally, please, calm down. 
No, you may not maim Harry. 
I don't know, find someone on the street. 
Trouble at home? 
 No. Why would you say that? 
He didn't call, did he? 
 Not yet. 
hmm. 
I just wish Sally had some woman friends to turn to. 
Are you asking for my help? 
 Are you offering it? 
How can I be offering if I don't know what you're asking? 
Why would I ask? I don't need help. 
 Then I'm not offering. 
Fine with me. 
You can't say it, can you? 
Help me! 
I don't know what to do. I 
can't stand to see her like this. 
There, that wasn't so hard. 
Then you'll help? 
 No. 
Can't you just take her out tonight and talk to her? 
You don't have to go alone. 
Nina would be happy to join you. 
Ooh, I'm sorry, tonight's the night I'm having my eyes gouged out. 
Can't you reschedule it? 
Put yourself in her position you go out on a date, you have a wonderful time, various arousing stimuli fly back and forth across the table, and then he doesn't call. 
How would you repair yourself? 
I'd get good and toasted and call him filthy names. 
Yes, great. Now go and 
do that with Sally. 
You're buying. 
Oh, of course. 
Oh, she's way more upset than that. 
Dr. Solomon, 
let me be blunt. 
Tommy seems to have a problem with authority. 
Only Tommy refused to climb the rope. 
What was at the top of the rope? 
If he were my boy, I'd warm up his little bottom. 
You're the one who didn't want him sitting with the girls, right? 
I think he's just jealous because I've done so much better than he has. 
Dr. Solomon, nobody ever 
said being a father is easy. 
You're telling me. Some 
of you must have children, as frightening as that thought is. 
What do you do? 
You need to set a good example for your son to live up to. 
Since when did my son become my responsibility? 
You're the ones who are falling down on the job. 
You're supposed to be educating him. 
Knowledge is the only chance this planet has for survival. 
One day you're going to have to find someone to pull your collective butts, out of the cosmic pliers, and all you'll have to pick from, is a bunch of rope climbers! 
Dr. Solomon, 
I think you're avoiding the real problem.. 
the home environment. 
Well, of course I'm avoiding it. 
It's full of crazy people. 
Oh, come on, Sally. I 
know you're in a lot of pain, but holding it in isn't going to do you any good. 
You've got to let it out. 
Come on, open up. 
That really helped. 
This can't be the first bad date you've ever had. 
 Well... 
a couple of years ago, a friend set me up, and my date turned out to be this giant, slimy yolk sac. 
Yeah, I've been there. 
 Who hasn't? 
I once dated this chemistry professor, Dr. Abrams. 
Oh, god, she's starting with the A's. 
He invited me to portage lakes for a romantic weekend, and then just never showed up. 
Did you kill him? 
 No, no. 
I don't believe in violence. 
Violence doesn't do you any good. 
However, a gas tank full of sugar and a flaming bag of dog poop will. 
And you take that orally? 
Tommy, your teachers seem to think I'm not acting enough like a father to you. 
You're not my father. 
 Well, that's true, but I want to try to act like one. 
Fine. What do fathers 
and sons do together? 
Oh, they do this. 
Yes, I've seen that. 
Aw. 
Excellent. 
We're roughhousing. 
Son. 
This has taken a wrong turn somewhere. 
I've got a better idea. 
We can do what the guy downstairs does with his son. 
They watch Tv for 18 hours straight. 
Yes, it's the classic male-Bonding ritual. 
Oh, look, Monday night football. 
all right! 
What is it? 
Isn't there someplace where people can just have meaningless sex with various partners? 
Yes, it's called the '70s. 
Well, how late is it open? 
Hey, check out the bartender. 
Ooh, god's gift to women. 
I hope he kept the receipt. 
Oh, get a load of the guy in the vest. 
 I hope he kept the receipt. 
See, Sally, you are not the problem. 
Guys are jerks. You're just 
never gonna find the perfect man. 
Yeah, the perfect man would have, Bill Gate's money, Jimmy Smit's ass. 
Liam Neeson's shoulders, Michael Jordan's thighs, and we need a brain. 
Oh ho, no we don't. 
Yeah, you're right, then he'd think like a man. 
See, Sally, there's just no dealing with the opposite sex. 
Yes, yes, the opposite sex. 
I didn't do anything wrong. 
It's men. 
They're a completely opposite sex. 
They hunt. We gather. 
They sweat. We glow. 
They shake. 
We wipe. 
You, your sexual organs are in total diametric opposition to mine. 
Well, hey, so can I give you a call sometime or...? 
Oh, yeah, I'll be waiting by the phone. 
Have we poisoned her? 
 No... 
now she's a buxom, leggy, pouty-lipped bitch with attitude. 
I think she'll do just fine. 
Hello, brad. 
 SSally. 
I came here to tell you that I understand your limitations. 
I expected too much. 
I'm so sorry. 
All the best. 
Got your knob. 
Hasn't tonight been great? 
Just us boys drinking beer, yelling like idiots, emitting various gasses. 
Oh! Oh, look. 
They're doing that thing again. 
Ohhhhhhh oh yeah ! 
Sally's back. 
 Party's over. 
thank god. 
 Sally, you're smiling. 
You're fixed. 
 No, Dick, I'm not fixed because I was never broken. 
I'm supposed to be this way. I'm a woman. 
Yes, and...? 
 Tell me, Dick, what kind of shampoo do you use? 
I don't know. 
Exactly, and do you feel the urge to have, an eight-pound screaming larva, rip its way out of your lower abdomen? 
No, I think I can do without that. 
You see, here, you and I, are completely different life-forms, and it's just some sick cosmic joke that we have to share a planet. 
You know, I've been thinking about your assignment, maybe it wasn't fair of me, making you the woman. 
I'm all right. 
I can handle the mood swings, the emotional issues, the catcalls, the punitive underwear, because, frankly, when I think of the alternative... 
I just have to laugh. 
Mother earth. 
Father time. 
Lady luck. 
 Gentleman's quarterly. 
Daughters of the American revolution. 
Son of Kong. 
Fairy godmother. 
 The godfather of soul. 
Mississippi. 
Mister sippi. 
Aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
And...well, they had an extra seat. 
Earth is a place where backing down, causes equal problems. 
Backing up causes severe tyre damage. 
What are you doing? 
 I'm waxing the floor. 
You know, it's nice to know that every time I take some responsibility, I move a step closer to my promotion. 
You're on the road to the top. 
And I don't care who I step on to get there. 
Well, nice job, Harry. 
Ha! Floor's so shiny, 
I can see up my own dress. 
That's enough. 
Sally.. 
you touched my radio. 
 No, I didn't. 
Yes, you did. 
I always leave it tuned to big country 902.1. 
I turned it on, and out came mucho salsa 106. 
Well, you used my leg razor to shave your stupid face. 
That's because the delicate handle is easier to grip. 
Listen, Mr. Anal, 
I am sick.. 
hey! Am I gonna have 
to separate you two? 
All we seem to do is argue ever since we came here. 
I don't want to talk about it. 
 We studied nine galaxies in perfect harmony. 
And we didn't leave scuff marks. 
We seem to be annoyed with each other. 
And as fascinating as that is, it's irritating as hell. 
Sally? 
 I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. 
I just got a shooting pain in my head when you began to speak. 
You know, August finds us quite charming in our naive determination to stay together. 
You tell your little girlfriend August to mind her own business. 
Yeah, and don't drink out of the milk carton. 
 Fine. 
Look at this. We're 
failing here. We're a family. 
We're supposed to be getting along. We've got to work on this. 
Could you please take this argument off my linoleum floor? 
Come off it, Harry. 
 Harry, you know what? 
I'll give you your promotion if you don't say "really" in the next two minutes. 
Really? 
 You lose. 
Dick, she tricked me. 
I don't want to talk about it! 
Well, I guess I just can't have nice things. 
What are you doing under my desk? 
 Sleeping. 
Why? 
 Because the top of your desk is hard and cold. 
You do have a bed at home, don't you? 
Yes, but I can't stand my house. 
It's filled with......Family. 
If I lived with my brother, it wouldn't last a week. 
You have a brother? 
That's great. 
Tell me about him. 
Well, he hasn't quite gotten settled yet. 
I don't think he's met the right woman, not that women are put off by him. Well, some are. 
Most are. 
What does he do? 
Oh something different every year. 
Right now he's restoring houses. 
I have a picture of him somewhere. 
Is this him? What a gut. 
 No, that's my mother. 
That's Roy. 
 Why don't you call him? I'd like to meet him. 
We don't get together much. 
 You don't get along? 
No, it's just hard. 
 Does he live far away? 
From my house? 
Three,... four blocks. 
So you choose to have nothing to do with him? 
That's not true. 
 You don't see him. 
Not very much. 
 But you'd like to see him? 
N-not very much. 
Then I was right, you don't want to have anything to do with him. 
I didn't say that. 
 Well, why don't you call him? 
Fine, I'll call him. 
 Yes! 
We've been meaning to get together. 
I'll ask him to drop by. 
Wonderful. 
And when he gets here, just act normal. 
I'd ask you to do the same, but I'm afraid that ship has sailed. 
Hello.  Roy? 
Tommy, would you sign my worksheet? 
Sure. What 
did you do? 
Well, I pre-peeled all these bananas for eating ease. 
Well, good job, Harry. 
 Yeah. 
Mangia. 
Mangia. 
Now I know why I like you, Tommy. 
You're always supportive and patient with your family. 
Well er, just the kind of guy I am. 
You spend a lot of time taking care of other people's needs, except mine. 
 Yeah, well.. 
wait, am I in trouble? 
How did I get in trouble? 
You're not in trouble. 
We're in trouble. 
I really hope we don't have to break up. 
Break up? We're not.. 
when did we break up? 
I just saying, I think it would be good if we focused more on each other. 
I'll show you focused. Let's 
go to a movie Friday night. 
I don't know. 
 August, please. Please? 
You're so needy. 
 I'm sorry. 
No, I like that in a man. 
No, Sally, I will not apologise. 
And let me tell you.. 
hello? Hello.. 
Sally, I am the high commander, and you are not allowed to hang up on.. 
hello? 
Sally? 
Dr. Solomon, this 
is my brother Roy. 
Whoa! Your head 
is huge. 
Oh, thank you. 
Enormous! 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 
How do you get any work done with all these 18-year-old butts waving in your face? 
Oh, I try, I try. 
So, tell me all about yourself. 
 Well...erm.. 
It must be fascinating restoring houses I don't restore houses. 
I sell vinyl siding. 
I think you under estimate the effect vinyl has on houses. 
Listen to her. She's always 
bragging on me 'cause she loves me, 'cause she's my monkey girl. 
 Don't do the monkey girl.. 
aren't you the monkey girl? 
No, you're the monkey girl. 
You want to hear the monkey sound? 
 Please. 
Please, not the monkey sound! 
No-- Ow! No, stop. 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
This is wonderful. 
Playful sibling aggression. 
It's fantastic. 
Please continue. 
no--  ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! 
You must be Roy. 
We've spoken. I'm Nina. 
Hey! It's nice to finally meet you. 
Nice to meet you, too. 
Gosh, you don't sound black on the phone. 
It's just something I picked up in spy school. 
Ooh, he's nice. 
I have a great idea. 
Why don't the two of you come over for dinner tonight at 7:00? 
No, no, no, no. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
I think the monkey might want to go. 
 Yes, yes, yes! 
Oh, wonderful. Roy, you 
are the perfect brother. 
This is the guy you said was a pompous ass? 
That's me. 
Sally, the albrights will be here any minute now. 
This is a special occasion. 
Where's the salmon mousse, the duck terrine, the smoked chub? 
You know, Dick, I have a cleaver in my hand. 
I have a date with August. Don't wait up. 
Oh, no. No!, no. 
Dr. Albright 
and her brother are coming to dinner tonight. 
 So? 
You've got to see them together, they're just.. 
adorable. 
Their relationship is everything that our family's isn't. 
Well, can you just take good notes, because tonight is my chance to get into Braville. 
You can go to Braville some other time. 
hello!  Is it safe to come up? 
Come on up! 
Come on up! 
Welcome, Albright children. 
Oh, allow me to take your coats. 
Dick, make a note of it. I am 
taking initiative and their coats. 
Good for you, Harry. 
That's my brother Harry, and this is Tommy, my son. 
Oh hey, partner! 
How're you doin'? 
Hey, what's that? 
A quarter? 
Oh, I get it. You're 
trying to impress a youngster with what you think is a mystifying feat of trickery. 
He's a smart one, this one. 
Cut your hair. 
You look like a girl. 
Here. Sit down. 
Everybody just make yourselves comfortable. Let me have that. 
Can I have a glass of that now? 
 Harry, take the wine. 
Wine taken. 
Jordan H. Almonds! 
You are one beautiful woman. 
Why does every man I meet have to remind me of that like I'm going to forget? 
Sally, as siblings, Roy and Mary are fun-loving and playful. 
You know, Mary and I are thick as thieves. 
Hey monkey, remember the time mom found all my "playboys," and you said they were yours, and you had to spend two years in therapy? 
Harry, come on in here. 
Let's all, uh...be sociable. 
Here.. 
 I was sitting there. 
Just.. 
just relax. 
Interact naturally. 
Okay, Roy, I'll tell you what. 
Why don't you start things off by telling us some amusing family story? 
Well, I don't know how amusing this is, but this is the most amazing thing that ever happened to me. 
No one wants to hear your stupid story. 
No, I think they do want to hear my stupid story. 
No, they don't. 
Yes, they do want to hear my stupid story. 
this is fascinating. Roy, Roy, Roy! 
Please continue. 
You're going to think I'm crazy, but... 
I was once... abducted 
by an alien spacecraft. 
Excuse us. 
you promised you wouldn't talk about that. 
No, I promised I wouldn't talk about your chin implant. 
No, no, no! 
We're not killing anyone. 
Spacecraft, you say? 
I guess a layman would call it an abduction, but what those space people did to me that night was more of a spiritual kidnapping. 
Yeah, right, aliens travelled billions of light years through space to ram a probe up Roy Albright's butt. 
Tell us about the space people, Roy. 
I'm driving along the road one night really late, and then I pull off into this cornfield. 
And then all of a sudden, I see this rip in the atmosphere. 
And then hovering right over my head is this giant hovering thing. 
It was a weather balloon. 
Except weather balloons don't poke you in the eyes with needles. 
Well, that doesn't sound like anyone we know. 
I mean...."we know". 
Go on. 
I'm in the spaceship, and I'm surrounded by all this... 
foam? 
Exactly. 
Roy, you were never in a spaceship. 
I was in a spaceship and I have the scars to prove it! 
Roy lewis Albright, if you have one decent bone in your body, you will not do this to me. 
So, anyway, you can see where they are. 
that's it, no more. 
I need some air. 
Dr. Albright! 
 Let her go, Dick. Go on, Roy. 
Well the next thing I know, I'm being sucked up inside this big hose. 
the big hose? 
 the big hose. 
Roy, will you excuse us? 
Now we have to kill him. 
 You are overreacting. 
Dick, he could turn us in. 
Do you really want to be the subject of some alien autopsy show on the fox network? 
You're jumping to conclusions. 
And fox is not a network. 
We don't have all the facts yet. 
Dick I'm in charge of security, and I say we kill him. 
Well I'm the high commander, and I'm putting this decision on hold. 
I'm going to check on Dr. 
Albright. You go entertain Roy! 
I'll pull a quarter out of his ear. 
I'll pull his brain out of his ear. 
You all right? 
 Yeah. 
I'm sorry about Roy. I told 
him not to tell that story, but he never does anything I ask. 
 That's Sally all over. 
It's hard being the oldest. They 
think we're trying to run their lives. 
When all we're trying to do is control them. 
Do you think that Roy... 
actually was... 
abducted by aliens? 
No, but I prayed for it every night as a kid. 
What about you? 
Do you think there's intelligent life up there? 
There? 
Oh no, not there. 
There! 
Dick, can I talk to you for a second? 
 Can't you see I'm busy? 
Okay, let me rephrase this. 
Dick, can I talk to you for a second? 
Excuse me. 
This had better be important. 
I don't know if it's important or not, but, you know that cornfield down by the interstate? 
 Yes. 
Well Sally took Roy there to kill him. But sorry to interrupt. 
Oh, damn! 
She's willfully disobeying my orders. 
And in a cornfield? 
That's such a clich�. 
So, hey, the kids went down to the cornfield to have a little fun. 
Let say we join them. 
 I don't want to go to a cornfield. 
Maybe the monkey wants to go to a cornfield. 
What? 
 Does the monkey want to go to a cornfield? 
Don't you dare. 
All right, all right, all right! 
 Good, let's go! 
Hello? 
August? 
 We had a date tonight. 
Cornfield time. 
Either you go with him and live his life, or you come with me and live yours. 
But he needs me. 
Fine. 
Maybe next week you can try and get to first base with your dad. 
Tommy! 
bye bye, Dick. 
I like the way you work. 
You looked, and saw, you took. 
Now, can you lose Forrest gump over there? 
You're absolutely right. 
I'll go talk to him. 
I can handle this myself. 
Please, Sally, let me kill him. 
It'll look so good on my r�sum�. 
 The answer is no. 
Oh, Sally, please. 
Please. 
All right. You want the job, it's yours, 
but we do it my way. 
Hey, what's going on over there? 
The action's over here. 
Coming! 
Okay, take this rock. 
When you hear me say the words, "big dipper" bash him over the head. 
Can you do that? 
 Prepare to be dazzled. 
So you couldn't shake him, huh, babe? 
 No. 
Uh... 
Oh..Roy, look over there. 
It's..it's the big dipper. 
Roy? 
 Oh, yes. 
No, that's Orion's belt. 
Excuse me. 
Give me the rock, rockhead! 
Now just stand guard. 
Prepare.. 
 Shut up! 
You sure you don't mind seeing this movie? 
Oh, no. 
Anne Bancroft, Olympia dukakis, and holly hunter? 
What teenage boy wouldn't want to see this movie? 
August, do you get along with your family? 
No. My father doesn't 
give me any credit. 
He still treats me like a little kid. 
He doesn't recognise how old I am on the inside. 
 Me, too. 
You know, we really have a lot in common. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
Hey you really want to see this movie? 
There's no one in my house. 
I want to see the movie. 
 Me, too! 
See how much we have in common? 
Two, please, for, um... 
"They came to talk". 
You're a big girl, aren't you? 
You know what really makes me hot? 
Tell me. 
The back of a man's head. 
Well, then feast your eyes on this. 
Oh, yeah! 
 Whoa! Dick is coming. 
Halt operation kilroy. 
Dick, what a pleasant surprise. 
You'll know this one. 
Now, is that the big dipper.. 
don't try to kiss up. 
Your ass is grass. 
I can't believe you, Roy. 
This is where that Ufo story always ends up.. 
you and a woman in a cornfield. 
You make me sick. 
I did not ask to be beamed on board that ship of unspeakable horror. 
Excuse me. Beamed? 
You said "sucked". 
No, I said "beamed." 
 Who heard "sucked"? 
Well, yeah. 
You're lying. I'm lying. 
He's lying. 
I have had it with you. 
Name one thing I did wrong tonight. 
You lied, you embarrassed me, you were yourself. 
Well, if you're going to nitpick, I'm leaving. 
 Thank god. 
So, I'll see you on mom's birthday? 
Yeah. You want to go in on a present? 
 Nothing over 40 bucks. 
You got it. 
I need a ride. 
Oh, really? 
 Sally. 
Whatever. 
Hey, wait for me. 
What just happened here? 
 What do you mean? 
You're going to see him at your mom's birthday? 
Yeah. It's a birthday. 
He's family. 
So, no matter how obnoxious you are, how much of a burden you become, you can still count on the forgiveness of your family? 
Yeah. 
Even if they touch your radio and refuse to make smoked chub, and disobey your orders not to kill? 
Yeah, even then. 
That is so beautiful. 
I'm a brother. 
All right, Dick, come on. 
I disobeyed orders. I deserve 
some punishment. What'll it be? 
Well, Sally, ordinarily I'd send you to some desolate moon, and make you stand in a crater and think about what you've done. 
But I've realized, that I've got to accept your flaws and your inadequacies, because you're my sister now. 
And even though sometimes you tick me off, I think I... 
I love you. 
What? 
 You're my little sister, and I love you. 
Now, how does that make you feel? 
Well, um... 
I want to blame you for everything and push you off the roof. 
Well, that's great, because Dr. Albright 
loves her brother and she feels the same way. 
Great, 'cause that's how I feel. 
I'm so glad we've got that settled. 
 Me, too. 
Whoa! 
I love you, too. 
I'm so happy! 
I think you'll like this, Dick. 
The commercial said the extra ingredient is love. 
Next time try making the extra ingredient cheese. 
What's with Harry? 
 Don't bother him. 
He's transmitting my status report. 
 Status report? 
To the big giant head? 
Why should we have to answer to that pencil-pushing desk jockey anyway? 
Frankly, I don't care what he thinks. 
What did it say about me? 
Resume normal functions in three, two, one. 
What did I miss? 
 So what did you put in the report? 
Lots of time and effort. 
 Come on, read it back. 
"Dear big giant head, how are you? We're fine. 
So's the weather Yada, yada, yada. 
"The mission is taking longer than anticipated. 
The being designated Sally has bravely infiltrated the female gender. 
The Harry unit is functioning adequately. 
The high commander has squandered six months in the futile pursuit of a single earth woman.." 
Wait, wait! 
What was that? 
I am functioning adequately. 
That thing about my futile pursuit of Dr. Albright. 
How could you write this about me? 
I'm the information officer. 
I'm sworn to tell the truth. 
Well, the truth is that through Mary I have explored every facet of the male/female dynamic. 
Have you established a monogamous relationship with her? 
No. 
 Have you bonded emotionally? 
No. 
 Have you had one successful date? 
Well, if by successful you mean pleasant, no. 
Well I wouldn't sweat it, Dick. you know, 
The big giant head never reads these things, anyway. 
Perhaps I have been remiss, but mark my words. 
By the week's end, I will have established an emotional beachhead with Dr. Albright. 
This I vow. 
Yeah, and Harry's going to win the Nobel prize. 
Well, I'm happy just to be nominated. 
Good morning. 
 Good morning, Nina. 
Those are nice. 
They cost 89 dollars. 
Don't tell her that. 
 Oh, right. 
Good morning. 
They cost 89 dollars. 
Oh. 
 Dr. Albright, would you do me the honour 
of joining me for dinner tonight? 
No. 
Why are you doing this? 
Can't you see how much pain you're causing? 
He's nothing, if not resilient. 
Not him, me! 
The two of you are driving me up the wall. 
You're obviously attracted to him. 
Take a chance on love, woman. 
I don't know. 
Look at him. 
I suppose it's time to give the big dog a biscuit. 
And I do have to eat. 
Okay, I'll go out with you. 
 Yes! 
Come on, Dick, I really need to get in there. 
I'm sorry. I need to be handsome tonight, 
and I mean Sears-Catalog handsome. 
If he wants to get somewhere with her, he should follow my lead. 
Mr. Randell and I have 
a dreamy relationship. 
Yeah, you don't even call him by his first name. 
That's what sophisticated people do on this planet. 
I realize it's not as romantic as you and August meeting in the lunchroom and sharing your pudding cup. 
Hey! We were just voted 
cutest couple, so shut up. 
Okay, where's my shoes? 
I think I saw one of them right over there. 
Oh, my god, it's Harry. 
His cranial microreceiver, it's activated. 
Transmission incoming from the big giant head. 
Thank you for calling the big giant head. 
He cares about "you". 
Your status report was received. Please wait for comments. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
 Please, please, no comments. 
There are no comments. 
Resume normal functions in three, two, one. 
I told you the big giant head never reads those things. 
I really resent how we're supposed to jump every time the big giant head sends a message. 
I know, everyone knows he only got the job by kissing the big giant butt. 
Oh, this is fun. 
What a great idea. 
Hey, he knew what he was getting into when he took this job. 
August? 
we share more than pudding, don't we? 
You've got pudding? 
No, I was using it as a metaphor for our relationship. 
Our relationship is soft and gooey? 
No, no. Never mind, okay? Never mind. 
You didn't have to walk me up. I know the way. 
I don't mind. 
You mentioned coffee. 
Hey, guys. 
Hi, Mr. Randell. 
Well, sit down. 
Take off your shirt.. shoes. 
Tommy, I need the parlor to entertain Mr. Randell, 
Mr. Kevin Randell. 
We're doing homework. 
 Yeah, Mesopotamia. 
Oh, the fertile crescent. 
Would you like to see it? 
Pardon? 
 Never mind. 
I'll see to that coffee. 
Tommy, help auntie Sally. 
Excuse us. 
I need the living room to be alone with Mr. Randell. 
Why? 
I think I'm falling in love with the guy. 
You just want the living room so you can make out. 
So how's history this year? 
Good. - Good. 
Thanks for bailing me out. 
You are so much fun. 
Dr. Albright, your hand is on my knee. 
Do you want me to move it? 
 Please. 
No, I meant move it around. 
Well, August sure left early. 
Yeah, after you dumped coffee on her, she got the hint. 
She made a rude comment about my jell-o with cheese. 
Jell-o with cheese? 
What kind of woman are you? 
Come on, let's not squabble. We're family. 
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. 
Let's play a game, shall we? What'll it be? 
Bite me. 
 All right, who's it? 
Okay, fine. 
You know, you try to help, but this is the thanks you Ge.. 
Transmission incoming from the big giant head. 
What, again? 
 Thank you for your status report. 
I judge your mission to be a complete failure. 
Replacements arrive in 24 hours. 
Resume normal functions in three, two, one. 
What'd I miss? 
They're aborting the mission. 
 Replacements arrive tomorrow. 
They're sending us home. 
ohh! 
ooohhhhhhh! 
Oh, Dr. Albright, 
that was the greatest 30 seconds of my life. 
Ahh! Smell 
the spring air. 
What do you say we have class outside? 
The world is such a perfect place. 
What are we doing indoors? 
 Dr. Solomon. 
What is it, darling? 
Well, I think we're supposed to be having our final exam. 
and I'm shooting for a "d," so I'll need the full hour. 
Final exam? 
Today? 
I forgot. 
Isn't that a hoot? 
You see, I didn't make it home last night. 
I could have, but I was awfully comfortable where I was, in a place that's definitely not home. 
Dr. Solomon, 
are you... 
all right? 
Oh I can't talk about it. 
It's too personal. 
Let's just say.. I had sex 
with Dr. Albright. 
Oh! 
Dr. Solomon, we don't 
need to know about this. 
That's where you're wrong, bug. You might learn something. 
Last night at 11:22, eastern standard time, my spiritual self, "x", and my corporeal self, "y", were fused together... 
for the first time. 
But let's move on. 
Dick, I need to talk to you. I have big news. 
Oh you do? 
Well I have big news, too. 
Can we please just step outside for a minute? 
All right. Class, 
while I'm gone, I'd like you to ponder being naked under cool, cool sheets. 
We're leaving?! 
Nooooooooooo! 
Just answer my question. 
 All right. 
Hypothetically speaking, if you were out of my life, I'd experience separation anxiety, and I'd probably harbor some resentment. 
But you know that even if we weren't together, I'd always care about you? 
Wait a second, are you dumping me? 
No. No! 
 It's that cheerleader Cheryl, isn't it? 
Well, let me clue you in pal. It's all padding. 
No, August, you don't.. 
you don't understand. 
Wait. It is? 
Do you like my Coffee? 
I put Cheese in it. 
It's good isn't it? 
It's erm... Cherry. 
Can I ask you a question? 
 Sure. 
If I could never make coffee for you again.. 
not that that's going to happen. 
I mean, I'm here with my pot, ready to pour. 
Would you miss me? 
Why are you asking me this? 
I don't know. 
Call it girlish insecurity. 
How would you feel? 
 Awful. 
Awful like somebody ripped your heart out and then showed it to you? 
Well, not showed it to me. 
So what you're saying is, without me you'd be a lonely, miserable wreck for what, a week, a month, the rest of your life? 
The rest of my life. 
Oh, Mr. Randell. 
You don't know how happy you've made me. 
Certainly. 
I thought you and Dr. 
Solomon had a date again tonight. 
We did. 
 He stood you up? 
Oh, no, I talked to him. 
He said he got an upsetting phone call from a friend with a big head, and he didn't think he'd be much fun tonight. 
Oh. Well, my all-time 
favorite excuse was "I have a terminal illness". 
You actually had that pulled on you? 
Yes, but in all fairness, the guy died. 
So you going to be okay? 
Nina, I am at the stage in my life where I refuse to let a man's childish behavior steer me off course. 
I am taking the high road. 
Yeah? If I were you, 
I'd go over there and nail his sorry ass to the wall. 
That "is" the high road. 
I can't believe we're being called back. I don't want to go. 
I know. I'm so upset. 
I don't know what to pack. 
Do you think I could take these open-toed metallic sandals? 
Lieutenant, once we're out of here, we won't even have feet. 
But they look like a pump and feel like a sneaker. 
Pull yourself together. 
I've grown attached to certain things on this planet, too. 
You think I'm not going to miss the sunsets, the change of seasons, the way my students avert their eyes when I pass them in the halls? 
You know what I'm going to miss the most? All of you. 
What do you mean? We're still going 
to be together. We're still a unit. 
I know, but we won't be a family anymore. 
Oh, lieutenant. 
 Oh, sir. 
I promised myself I wasn't going to do this. 
Harry, be brave. 
This is no time for weakness. We must be strong. 
Dick. 
 Mary. 
Dick. 
 Mary. 
Dick. 
 Harry. 
What? 
I'd like a few words with you in private. 
Mary, we have no secrets. 
Whatever we have to say to each other we can say in front of the whole group. 
Last night when we were having.. 
 Let's go out onto the roof. 
Well, I'm going to go down and get my record collection for the trip back. 
You know, tunes for the road. 
Great, 14 light-years of glen Campbell. 
I have something to say to you. 
 So do I. 
Something important, but I don't know how to start. 
Let me take a stab at it. 
You love me. Last night 
meant the world to you, but you have to push me away so you don't hurt me. 
Someday I'll see it was all for the best. 
Please believe you! 
Please believe you! 
That's it exactly. 
Mary, you understand my every thought. 
I understand. You've had 
the milk. Why buy the cow? 
No, I want you. 
I want the cow. 
For what, a one-night stand in the barn? 
I will not be treated this way. 
You hurt me. 
 How did I hurt you? 
Do you know why we ended up at my place last night? 
Not because I was lonely. Not 
because I had too much sake. 
We ended up there because... 
I care for you. 
Oh, Mary. 
Why did you have to wait until now to tell me? 
What's wrong with now? 
I wish I had a machine that could freeze time. 
Unfortunately, I left it in my other jacket. 
Dick? 
 Aah! 
Dick, come in here. I've got 
wonderful news from "home". 
You.. 
wait right here. 
I'll be right back. 
Dick's here. 
What is it? 
Okay, there was a mistake in the message. 
 Tell me! 
Dick, you're the only one who's going. We all get to stay. 
Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
How did you get your information? 
Well I was down in the basement getting my record collection, and I bumped into your replacement. 
 My replacement? 
It's in the basement. He 
wants to talk to you, Dick, Now. 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Where are you? 
You.. 
you're gorgeous! 
Thank you. 
This body should suit me nicely. 
The big giant head is very unhappy, Commander. 
I've been sent here to replace you and complete the mission with ruthless efficiency. 
And now I'm afraid it's time for me to assume command. 
You think you can just waltz in here and take over? 
You have no idea! 
The people here are so complex. 
They have all these feelings and impulses, dreams and fears. 
And every time you've mastered one, another one catches you by surprise. 
Tonight I finally made a breakthrough. 
One of these people cares about me. 
You can't make me leave now! 
Oh, yes, I can. 
What about... 
Mary? 
I'll take care of her... good. 
No. I won't 
allow it! 
I love her! 
I'm not leaving her! 
How touching. 
You know, you've actually changed my mind. 
I think I will let you stay here, right here, forever. 
No. You're not.. 
Oh, my god! 
He's turned me into a mime! 
You know, if you play " Wichita lineman" backwards, you get our national anthem. 
What's so funny, Dick? 
I am not... Dick. 
I'm your new high commander. 
From this point forward, you will refer to me as such. 
Okay, Such. 
What have you done with Dick? 
That's for me to know and you to find out. 
There's going to be a lot of changes around here. 
For instance.. 
from now on this goes here. 
And that's just the first of many... 
changes. 
Wow, what a black hole. 
Ah, Mary. 
Is everything all right? 
Oh everything's perfect. 
For the last six months, I've been a bumbling fool. 
As of right now, that's over. 
I only care about one thing now, and that's pleasure.. 
yours and mine. 
Oh, please. 
 That's good. 
I like it when they beg. 
How dare you.. 
 Shh! 
Let daddy drive. 
Wow! 
Aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
And...well, they had an extra seat. 
The Earth is populated by millions of beautiful women, Those that aren't beautiful have great personalities. 
You know, there's something about the moon and stars thats.. 
so romantic. 
I wish that.. 
..Dr Albright was here instead of a group 
of ungrateful subordinates. 
What are you reading? 
 "Vogue." 
Ha! Look at this. 
"Stomachs are in, Breasts are out." 
Well, that's just basic anatomy. 
Why don't you look like that? 
Because that woman has used a line of products that promotes moist-looking skin and a vacant look in her eyes. 
Well, get some. 
I've also noticed, lieutenant, that most girls smell better than you do. 
All right, it's my job to research women, so I'll get some soap, but I want it understood it's not because I want to smell nice. 
Sally, you know, fragrance is an integral part of the human experience.. the 
smell of flowers in the springtime, the aroma of fresh baked apple pie. 
A beautiful sunset with pink and orange streaking the sky. 
Harry, that's a sight, not a smell. 
Oh. Well, 
I knew it was one of those face hole things. 
Good morning! 
 Shh! 
Please. 
I'm meditating. 
Oh, meditation. 
Interesting. 
Sometimes, when I'm feeling stressed out, I like to visualize myself in a peaceful place. 
Don't let me interrupt. 
You go on. 
How do you do it? 
Close your eyes. 
Breathe. 
And picture a beautiful place. 
Okay. 
Yes, I'm there. 
There's a lovely breeze. 
I'm wearing a gauzy dress. 
A wave hits me, but it doesn't matter because I've lost that winter weight. 
I take off my shirt. 
The sun embraces me like thousands of warm fingers. 
I am relaxed and free. 
Even my horse senses your calm. 
I didn't see your big horse, handsome stranger. 
That's because you were distracted by my.. 
chiseled pecs. 
Just then, their secretary arrives to say "it's all-you-can-eat fish day in the cafeteria." 
Ooh, fish. Great. 
Ah, yes, fish. 
My horse likes fish. 
Don't wander off. 
I'll just be a second. 
And, you, don't touch anything. 
Can I help you find something from the Firma De tata skin care line, miss? 
I'm looking for soap. 
Are you oily or dry? 
It depends on where you look. 
Combination. 
Are you familiar with our foaming face wash, De bara tata? 
Is it soap? 
 You'll love it. 
And today we have special on Olia De Firma eye cream. 
No, I just want soap. 
 How are you on toning gel? 
Mi throata tota is a must. 
If it's soap, I'll take it. 
Are you sloughing? 
What words are you not understanding? 
I need soap, just the soap. Give me soap! 
If I can help you or answer any questions, just let me know. 
I'm onya. 
Okay, onya, I was wondering if you could explain to me this human obsession with youth and why the cosmetics industry perpetuates this self-destructive behavior? 
Excuse me. 
Hey that was great, what you just said to her. 
I've seen you at school, right? 
 Yeah, I've seen you, too, hiding under the bleachers watching the cheerleaders. 
You didn't strike me as much of a thinker. 
I'm August. 
Don't call me Auggie. 
I'm Tommy. Don't call 
me Auggie, either. 
You know, it's so depressing how the baby boomers have distorted society. 
They screwed up the job market, froze music for 30 years, and now this. 
Yeah, they've created an entire industry attempting to recapture the youth they squandered. 
Tommy, you are insanely bright. 
Well, it's just how I feel. 
"Very berry lip stain." 
What do you think? 
Me like. 
Ooh! There's my cab. 
I'm late. 
Your cab? Where are you going? 
 To the airport. 
Oh, the airport. I'd love to see the airport. 
We could make a night of it. 
Well, I'm just going to be there until my plane leaves. 
Going on a little retreat. 
 Retreat? You're going away. 
Just for a week. 
 A week? 
Uh-huh. 
Is there a number I can call you if I need you? 
Ooh, gotta go. Bye. 
But.. 
Dr. Albright! 
Hey! You forgot your.. 
you forgot your..     me! 
Hi. 
Care for a complimentary facial from orca skin care for men? 
I don't think I should. 
Don't you deserve a little time-Out for yourself? 
No. 
 Come on. 
Sit down. 
Relax. 
Oooh  Soft. 
Thank you. 
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
You really have great skin. 
You probably stay away from the sun. 
Well, after almost crashing into it, you learn your lesson. 
Most men don't think they have time for pampering, but they're wrong. 
Well, I'm really not like most men. 
I could tell. 
Is it that obvious? Boy, 
is Dick going to be mad. 
You know, he keeps telling me that I need to fit in more. 
Who's Dick? 
He's my high commander. 
I was in a relationship like that once. 
Now, doesn't that feel good? 
The first time is always fabulous, isn't it? 
Dick! 
Oh it's you. 
How's your soap research? 
It's more than soap, Dick. 
It's a whole regime. 
Aviana gave me all these vials of potions to experiment with. 
Okay, this one dulls my shine. 
This one brings out my glow. 
But I'm going to put 'em both on my face at the same time and let 'em fight it out. 
Who's Aviana? 
 She gave me this. 
And expected nothing in return? 
So, does anybody notice anything... 
different about me? 
Your teeth look whiter. 
I bet you think I've been mountain biking, but, no. 
It's orca's sunless sea bronzer for men. 
Phillip says that it gives the illusion of being in the sun without all of the elastin damage. 
Who's Phillip? 
 My skin care specialist. 
He taught me that my self-esteem does not rely on what others think of me, but, instead, on how I look. 
Well, you look like an idiot. 
Oh? Well, the people 
at the personnel office didn't seem to think so. 
You're looking at the new orca pour homme representative. 
I get to wear a sailor's suit. 
Where's Tommy? 
 He's with his new girlfriend, August. 
August? Phillip? Aviana? 
Who are all these people? 
What kind of a store did you go to? 
They're just friends we made. You should try it. 
Excuse me, just because I've developed a relationship with one woman at the expense of developing a relationship with any other human on this planet does not mean I don't have any friends. 
 Name one. 
Well, I've got lots of friends. 
 Who? 
Willie, Steve, and... 
carpet giant. 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
Isn't it a beautiful day? 
You're in a cheerful mood. Do you 
forget that Dr. Albright is gone? 
Nope. 
 Nina... 
do you have the number where Dr. Albright is staying? 
Yep. 
 Good. 
Could you get her on the phone for me, please? 
 She said no calls. 
Nina you work for me, too. When 
I ask you to do something, you are to do it immediately, no questions asked! 
Whoo! 
Thank you. 
Why did you bring me here? 
Well, with Dr. Albright gone, 
I thought it would be a nice chance for us friends to catch up. 
Mm-hmm. 
 So, um... 
how long have you been at Pendleton Nina? 
Three years. 
 My, that's a long time. 
You're going to fire me, aren't you? 
Why would you think that? 
 Because I won't give you the phone number. 
That would be.. 
 If you think that I won't cause a scene just because we're in a fancy restaurant, you had better think again because I'm going to tell you exactly what I think of your sorry ass and the loser school that owns it because I, Nina Campbell, am quitting! 
I work damn hard for you! 
Nina, sit down. 
I'm not firing you. 
You're not? 
 No. 
Oh. Okay. 
I'd like to change my order. 
Bring me the rack of lamb and a beefeater martini, straight up with an olive. 
But about Dr. Albright's number.. 
 Don't press your luck. 
Dick, I made you a sandwich. 
Aren't you ever coming home? 
Not until I find out where Dr. Albright is staying. 
Oh, mama! 
Walk that around. 
Why did I say that? 
 I've been getting that all day. 
Everywhere I go, men just react like that, even construction workers. 
You know, this stuff changes you somehow. 
It's like the clogged pores keep your self-esteem from escaping. 
I think I like it. 
She must have left her number here somewhere. She keeps everything.. 
she's so anal. 
Will you drop it? We'll 
just build another Albright. 
We have the technology. 
We have the leftover flesh. 
And I could really use the extra freezer space. 
Are you mad? There's only one Dr. Albright. 
Calm down. 
You don't understand. 
I need to talk to her right now! 
Pull yourself together, man! 
Thank you, lieutenant. 
You smell great. 
You know, Tommy, you really have an old soul. 
I like it. 
 Oh, you do? 
Well, um...  it is really, really old. 
So, Dick's not your real father, is he? 
Well, how'd you know? 
Well, you seem to have this kind of loyalty to him, but, no real emotional connection. 
Tommy? 
Have I upset you? 
No, I was just trying to look down your blouse. 
What? What did I say? What? 
I don't know how I ever could have expected a 14-year-old boy.. 
and I emphasize "boy".. 
to be able to separate my body from my mind. 
Wait, August, they're attached. 
Wait! Hold on. 
Wait! Come back! 
Wait. Stop. 
Let's talk about my feelings some more. They're really screwed up. 
You heard me. 
...Mary Albright. 
Well, she's not at the bangkok Sheraton. 
When you can't go to the sea, the sea comes to you with Orca. 
Doesn't "orca" mean whale? 
Yes. All of 
our products are derived from essential whale oils. 
All the goodness of whale. 
Isn't that animal cruelty? 
Oh, no. No, they 
don't kill the whales, they just corner 'em. 
You would be amazed at how much oil they let go when they are really scared. 
Find out what Eskimo men have known for centuries. 
Ah, I see you're already familiar with our bronzer. 
All Righty. 
Aviana.. 
Aviana, over here. 
Excuse me. 
Aviana, I'm flaking bad. 
I need some more samples. 
I'm sorry. Only the first sample is free. 
Now you have to pay. 
 Just a little scrub. 
Half an ounce? I'll get the 
money. You know I'm good for it. 
I'm sorry. My suppliers 
would never go for that. 
Okay, I see how this works. 
You reel me in with your glossy ads, get me hooked on freebies. 
Next thing you know, I'm out trying to scrape together enough cash for a lousy tube of concealer. 
Fine, don't buy it then. 
I have plenty of others who want it. 
Would you like a free sample of Firma De tata? 
No! Don't do it. 
Just say no. 
When you can't go to the.. 
why did I have to come here? 
I was perfectly happy sitting in my room, fantasizing that August doesn't hate my guts. 
Because you're the information officer. 
I'm sure you can defeat a simple door lock. 
What are you doing?! 
This is illegal. 
Now we're breaking and entering. 
What did you expect me to do? Beam you in? 
Smell. 
What? 
 Mary! 
You know, you and I are pathetic. 
We're superior beings. We're 
supposed to be here studying the human race, not mooning over a couple of chicks. 
I'm not mooning, I'm obsessing. There's a difference. 
Now, look around for a travel brochure or itinerary, something. 
No Dick, I have to get home. 
I have to wait by the phone for August not to call. 
All right, you do that. 
I'm gonna... 
hang around here for a while. 
Dick? You're not gonna do 
anything creepy, are you? 
You know me better than that. 
I'm just going to rifle through her belongings. 
August... 
I just came for my backpack. 
Oh. Well, it's 
on the bed. 
Listen, I ran out, because I was disappointed in you. 
I thought you were different than other guys. 
Oh, I am different. 
You have no idea how different I am. 
Well, you're not totally to blame, because I know I send some really mature signals. 
Okay, I can deal with that. 
I can forget the physical stuff and just be completely intellectual all the time. 
Well, I hope not...all the time. 
Thank god, 'cause, frankly, I couldn't have done that. 
Look, it's not that complicated. 
Sometimes you go with the intellectual, sometimes you go with the physical, and sometimes just closeness is nice. 
Well how will I know when to do what? 
I'll decide that as we go along. 
Why, Dr. Albright, 
you're being so naughty. 
Oh. 
I just came by to feed the fish. 
Me, too. 
Good morning, Nina. 
 Good morning, Dr. Albright. You look great. 
I feel like a million bucks. 
Did I miss anything? 
Mmm, not really. 
Mary!  You came back! 
When humans come together, they.. 
they... connect somehow. 
And when one of them goes away, they..they..pull out 
a part of you. 
Dr. Albright took a piece 
of me with her when she left. 
And when she came back, I felt normal again. 
Well, as normal as one can feel in these bodies. 
While we're on the subject of bodies, why is mine so much higher maintenance than yours? 
I think the economy relies on it. 
Hi, guys. 
What are you selling now? 
Well, surprisingly, I got fired, but Phillip found me a new job. 
I am now a full-time employee at the Spartacus lounge. 
Good for you, Harry. 
You know, a man is never really complete when he's alone. 
And a woman's not complete unless she's making you beg. 
How do the men here survive when the women go away? 
They go to bars. 
They get along without their women? 
They make do. 
Why do we have to come to school to talk to Tommy's teachers? 
I know, it's a waste of time. 
Why can't they come to us? 
The high school teachers on this planet are so full of themselves. 
It's all those TV commercials glorifying learning. 
You know, "the more you know". 
It makes them drunk with power. 
Yeah, well, that's going to change right now. 
Where's this Mr. Randell, anyway? 
When that mealymouthed little worm shows up, I'm going to teach him the meaning of the word.. 
hiya. 
Dr. And Mrs. Solomon? 
 No. 
No, no, no. 
I'm his sister, a woman. 
Not married. 
Just me, single Sally. 
Mr. Randell, I'd like to get out of 
here while I'm still clean-shaven. 
So you can begin lavishing Tommy with praises anytime you're ready. 
Well, the truth is that... 
I think Tommy can do a lot better. 
Be careful, sir. You're 
talking about the creature I've come to think of as my son. 
He could do better. 
You know... 
whatever. 
 Excuse us. 
What are you doing? 
 I don't know. 
He's giving off this vibe. 
Can't you feel it? 
Yes, I think I do. 
Does it feel like a stabbing pain in your left buttock? 
No. 
 Then I appear to be sitting on a tack. 
Dr. Solomon, Tommy's 
very bright, no question. 
Unfortunately, Tommy's having a little trouble fitting in. 
What do you mean, fitting in? 
 Excuse me, but there's something about the thickness of your neck and the broadness of your shoulders that makes me think you'd be an agile hunter and provide well for our children. 
I chaperone the school dance every year. 
Would you..? 
 Yes. 
Great. 
 Wait a minute. What about Tommy? 
He's fine. 
Great kid. 
Well... 
why didn't you say so in the first place? 
Next time, you might try organizing your thoughts on a little index card first. 
Come on, Sally. 
 Ow! 
Wasn't he cute? 
 Totally adorable. 
A little on the scattered side, though. 
 He asked me to a dance. 
I get to go dancing! 
 Nice. 
What's dancing? 
Harry, can I ask you a question? 
Uh, sure. 
Just give me a second to finish what I was doing. 
Okay, what is it? 
Can you dance? 
 Hmm. 
I have no idea, but I'll try. 
Why, yes, I can. 
It appears I'm quite good. 
How are you doing that? 
 I have no idea. 
I think it's sort of a built-In function. You try. 
Wow! You suck. 
You must feel like crap. 
That's it, spank me. 
Tommy, I talked to your teacher, Mr. Randell. 
He said that you're not fitting in. 
 Of course I'm not fitting in. 
To fit in, you have to be something. 
 Well, we're something. 
We're human beings. Why, 
has anyone said differently? 
No, it's just everybody at school is something extra. 
You know, they're African American or Italian-American or Asian-American, audio-Visual American. 
Well, we're human-American. 
That should be enough. 
Dick, it's part of my mission as an adolescent to rebel against my upbringing. 
If you don't tell me what we are, then I can't do my job. 
Frankly, I can't work like this. 
All right, if we have to be part of some group, we will be. 
I'll do some research. 
I'll ask around. 
I'll find out what the best thing to be is. 
By the end of the week, we'll be that. 
 What should I be till then? 
Well, we're carbon-Based life-forms. 
Just tell everyone we're carbo-Americans. 
Aztec, Toltec, Toltec, Inca, Inuit, Bedouin, Indian, Sikh. 
Aztec, Toltec, Toltec, Inca, Inuit, Bedouin, Indian, Sikh. 
Aztec, Toltec, Toltec, Inca, Inuit, Bedouin, in.. 
what are you doing at my desk? 
Anthropology, it's fascinating. 
Such a wealth of cultures. 
Up until now, I always thought that what you did was pointless and of no interest to anyone but yourself. 
It's certainly not as fascinating as physics. 
I mean, everybody loves maths. 
Get away from my desk. 
Nina, what is that thing on your head? 
It's called a "daku". 
 I think it's beautiful. 
Thank you. 
It's authentic. 
It makes me feel connected to my ancestors. 
 Oh. 
So that's the traditional headdress of ancient secretaries? 
No, of my African ancestors. 
In case you haven't noticed, I'm black. 
Well, of course I noticed. 
And, Dr. Albright, 
you are? 
Could I be any whiter? 
What? 
I'm sorry, all you people look alike to me. 
Excuse me? 
 What was that? 
Nothing, I just don't see why people have to divide up into these arbitrary subsets. 
I mean, skin color? Please. 
you may see color, but I see people. 
Aren't we fortunate to have someone so enlightened? 
O pious one, show us the way. 
This verges on sarcasm. 
You know, my heritage happens to be very important to me. 
As it should be. I'm Irish, 
and I'm very proud of that. 
And you're... what? 
Me? Uh, 
I,I,I'm, uh... 
one of those, uh... 
you know, one of the really good ones. 
You're this big anthropologist. You tell me. What am I? 
Certifiable. 
 Yes, that's what I am....Certifiable. 
Certifiable and damn proud of it, as my father was before me and his father before him and his father before him. 
Certifiable. 
Of course, we no longer practice. 
You see, Sally, dancing is all about attitude. 
Watch Harry. 
See, I got that "hip-hop, street, don't care about Nothin' 'cause I'm all of that and a side of fries" kind of attitude. 
Right, whereas my attitude is more got home from teaching physics and I'm wondering what's for dinner but I ain't gonna sweat it ' cause I ain't even from here. 
hey! Ho, ho! 
Hey! Ho, ho! 
Although we dis 'em, we love this solar system I hate this! 
 What? 
I can't believe I have to learn to dance to be with this guy. 
Well, you know, if you really want Mr. Randell, 
use the skills you're comfortable with. 
Shoot a tranquilizer dart into his neck and drag him back to your place. 
Harry, that is not the behavior of a human female. 
Exactly. I want to 
charm him, beguile him. 
I want him to buy me a pwesent. 
Tommy, how was school? 
 Awful. 
I lost my math book, and I couldn't convince anybody that I was Samoan. 
Well, don't worry. 
The answer to all our problems is right here in this book. 
It's loaded with every possible genre of human. 
It's like a catalog. 
You can take your pick, whatever you want to be. 
So who do you want to join, hmm? 
 They're too scrawny. 
Mm-hmm. Them? 
 No, ugly flag. 
Nah, too many gods. 
I'm not putting that on my head. 
Ah-ha! Here we go. 
Canadians. 
Yeah, right. 
Now, let's have a look at Einstein's boundary conditions according to the theory of relativity. 
Einstein, a Jew, never could have made this breakthrough, had it not been for the earlier work of Copernicus, polish, or tycho Brahe, the unlucky Dane from Prague. 
Which brings up another question.. 
how many Puerto Ricans do we have in class? Any Puerto Ricans? 
Leon, what are you? 
 You don't have to answer that. 
Dutch. 
 I love your tulips and your dikes. 
Oh, thank you. 
However, I turn your people down because of the silly shoes. 
Okay, no Puerto Ricans? 
Any Latinos in general? 
Anyone with Latino information? 
Dr. Solomon, with all due 
respect, I find this offensive. 
Pittman, you won't be left out. I'll get to the Asians. 
Why are you suddenly so interested in what everybody is? 
I have to know. It's important. 
 No, it's not. 
Yes, it is. 
 No, it's not. 
Yes, it is. 
 No, it's not. 
Yes, it is. 
 No, it's not. 
The only thing that matters about a person is what they have inside. 
Oh, yeah? 
Then how come you only date good-looking guys? 
That's not true. 
 You turned him down. 
Shut up! 
Here are your books. 
I read each one of them, and I'm just as confused as I ever was. 
You read 15 books in one night? 
I took a couple of hours out to watch Japanese golf on cable. 
The problem is, these books are full of dry facts but no value judgments. 
I mean, this is your field.. you tell me. 
Out of all the possible ethnic groups, which one is the best? 
Oh, no, there's no best. 
It's all subjective. 
Which do you find the most interesting? 
 There are so many. 
Um... I love the creative 
ambition of the Maori people, uh, the Polynesian culture with its joyous embrace of nature, uh, the quiet dignity of.. 
what's the sexiest? 
 Italians. 
Italians? 
 Smoky, swarthy. 
Gotta have 'em. 
Gotta go. 
Italian? 
In napoli where love is king where a boy meets a girl here's a-what-a they sing when-a Da moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's Amore what are you doing? 
 Buona sera, Signorina. 
When-a Da world seems to shine like-a you've had you too much wine that's Amore there's a ring ting-A-ling-a-ling ting-a-ling-a-ling and we sing vi... 
Ta Bella hearts will play tippy tippy-Tay tippy-tippy-Tay like a gay... 
tar... antella 
What the hell's going on out there! 
Nothing, Mr. Wagner! 
Would you please get out of here before somebody calls the cops? 
The cops, they cannot-a thwart my passion! 
I will stand right here till a pack of wild dogs, they chase-a me away! 
Dogs!  Run! 
Usually when a student gets hurt, we let them go home early. 
Someone from your family could come pick you up. 
Someone like... 
Sally. 
Why did you say her name like that? 
All I said was... 
Sally. 
No, thank you. I don't 
really need to get picked up. 
Exactly what happened? 
 I don't know what I did wrong, but I'm kind of new at being Korean. 
Oops. You left this 
in my driveway. 
What happened to it? 
 I backed over it five or six times. 
It was an accident. 
Do you have any idea how badly you embarrassed me last night? 
Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a concertina in Ohio? 
What the hell was going on in your head? 
I know what this is. You don't 
like Italians as much as you claim. 
Wait a minute, since when don't you like Italians? 
Please, we're discussing prejudice here, something you know nothing about. 
I'm black. 
 Oh! 
Right, right. 
Nina is... black. 
Sally, come out of there. 
 Go away! 
Then we're coming in! 
What's wrong? 
You look beautiful. 
Sure, you can put on a tight little dress and look sexy and gorgeous, but you know how men are.. 
all they care about is how you dance. 
What's the matter with you? 
 I'm afraid. 
Of what? 
 I'm afraid I'm going to do something stupid, and he won't like me. 
Don't leak. I hate it when you leak. 
What's wrong with me? 
 I have no idea. 
Dick, maybe I'm just shooting pork in a barrel here, but isn't that exactly how you feel about Dr. Albright? 
Oh, please. 
 That is so wrong. 
What I have with Dr. Albright... 
 Mr. Randell is young... 
Come in! 
Ow. 
Sorry to interrupt, but, Sally, your date's here. 
What am I going to do? 
 I'll tell you what you're going to do. 
You're going to be great! You know why? 
 Why? 
Because you're one of us. And 
although I don't know what that is yet, when I find out, that's what you'll be. 
 Thank you. 
Everybody ready? 
 Ready. 
Let's go. 
Now go out there and be a girl! 
You look incredible. 
Come on! 
 Thank you. 
That's very sweet of you. 
Well... 
well... so.. 
 What? 
Would you like to.. 
 Bear your children? 
No. I was going 
to say "dance. 
Oh. 
Uh, that was really embarrassing, wasn't it? 
No. 
No, not at all. 
So would you like to? 
Bear your children? 
Dance? 
Oh. Um... 
well, see, I don't really think that that would...Okay. 
Ahhhh. 
Now, this I can do. 
I was kind of afraid to come here tonight. 
Why? 
 I just wasn't sure I'd have a good time. 
Oh. Are you having 
a good time? 
Oh, yeah. 
Can I put my arm around you? 
Yes. 
Can I put my head on your shoulder? 
Please. 
Can I put my hand in your pocket? 
Do you need change? 
Desperately. 
You're so wonderful. My whole front is warm. 
You mind if I turn around? 
 Well, I.. 
mmm. 
Toasty. 
I don't want to put you on the spot, but if we don't kiss soon, my head's going to explode. 
You know what's good for that? 
What?  Calcium. 
Whoa, this planet sucks lord, it makes me wanna cry yeah, I said this planet sucks lord, it makes a poor boy wanna cry anybody'd know we was leavin lord, I might just lay my head down and die Tommy, what are you doing? 
Well, I'm black now. 
I'm black, and I got the blues. 
You can't be black. 
Nina is black. 
I get the impression from her they have strict rules about these things. 
I can't even be black ? 
 I command you to put that thing down. 
High commander starts bossin' best believe you better jump ooh! 
All right, stop it! 
Stop it! 
Who died and made you t-Bone walker? 
Mrs. Dubcek, as long 
as you're up here, what ethnic group do you come from? 
Well, I'm a little Czech, a little Romanian. 
I'm your basic Slavic mutt, like my third husband. 
Oh. What were 
your first two? 
Well, the first was Irish, and the second was one of your people. 
Our people? 
 Yeah. Well, you know, Jewish. 
Jewish! Oooh! 
So what tipped you off? 
With your name it's pretty obvious. 
 Our name? 
Solomon. 
Oh, you wonderful, wonderful woman! 
Thank you so much! 
I have to go now. 
This rules. 
I'm still a minority. 
You know, chicks dig minorities. 
Oh! Who knew that Solomon 
was a Jewish name when we took it off the side of that truck? 
Go figure. We could have 
been the wal-marts. 
We're Jewish. 
I don't know what to say. 
Mazel tov! 
I'm sorry, it just popped out. 
Isn't it great to know who we are? 
I finally feel like I belong to big melting pot they call earth. 
What a magical night. 
Everything was perfect. 
I was great. 
He really liked my kissing, except the spitting and biting. 
So you really like him, huh? 
 What's not to like? 
He's intelligent, kind, sweet, gentle. 
So... 
is he Jewish? 
It's a perfect night for observing. 
It's warm, dark. 
The air is crystal clear. 
Okay, they're in bed. 
You know, I'm not satisfied watching the Mullers from afar. 
This isn't what humans do. 
Humans don't just observe each other. They interact. 
We should make contact with them. 
 Ohh! 
Here's something different. 
You know, without their clothes, they seem kind of.. 
gelatinous? 
 Yeah. 
What is he looking for? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
Wait. Wait! 
Yes, this is it. 
I believe they're going to mate. 
Tommy, pay attention. 
Why? This is like 
sweating to the oldies without music. 
This is important. 
Sex is how humans enrich their relationships and reaffirm the commitment they've made to each other. 
It's the most sacred, intimate part.. 
 they're done. 
Already? 
Thank you very much! 
with the fiery eyes? 
Katie couric. 
Katie couric. 
It sounds like something beautiful stuck in your throat. 
Mrs. Dubcek, 
I need to go next door and become neighborly. 
What do you know about the Mullers? 
 They're lovely, very nice. 
Of course, I shouldn't talk. 
It's true your voice is not one of your best assets, but go ahead. 
 All right. 
The Mullers have had their ups and downs. 
I guess her husband had some problems in the bedroom area. 
Which area? 
The closet? 
That's what I thought it was at first, too, but it turned out to be a vitamin deficiency. 
Vitamin deficiency? Mr. 
Muller and I can talk about that. 
No, no. Stick 
to sports or cars. 
Cars, yes. 
That's great! 
I have a car. 
Oh, why am I doing this to myself? 
She probably doesn't even know I'm alive. 
No, she knows. 
Hi there, neighbour. You know anything about cars? 
 Is this your car? 
Yeah. I seem to be 
having some trouble with my... 
spark nuts. 
Well sometimes with these old ones, you're better just to call the junk man and have it towed away. 
No, I couldn't do that. 
I love this car. 
It has a compartment just for gloves. 
Dick Solomon. 
 Frank Muller. 
Haven't seen you around much. 
I've seen a lot of you and your wife. 
She says you're some big deal professor at the college. 
Hardly. It's 
quantum astrophysics. 
A drugged monkey could do it. 
What about you? 
 I work the line at the ball bearing plant. 
No, the cincor plant? 
 Yeah. 
Are you kidding? 
I love your bearings. 
What do you make? Thrust bearings or linear? 
Actually, I do journal bearings. 
Wow! Is that plain 
or rolling contact? 
On a good day, both. 
Man, the stories you must have. 
A few, a few. 
I thought you'd be more of an egghead. 
 No, all meat. 
Frank! 
 There's the boss. 
Well, I'll see you around. 
Oh, no big deal, but your car's parked about eight inches over the property line. Could you watch that? 
I'll go you one better. 
I'll stop doing it. 
Thanks, friend. 
"Friend." 
Watching television is amazing. 
I haven't had a thought in my head for three hours. 
And that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
Pseudofamily. 
 Where have you been? 
I have been... 
in Frank Muller's garage. 
We bragged, we laughed, we tinkered. 
He let me touch his stuff. 
It feels so good to be around Frank. 
It fills an empty space I've been feeling right here. 
I think it's because we're friends. 
So no one told you it was gonna be this way. 
What is this? 
 Shake 'n bake chicken. Just eat it. 
No, this isn't chicken. 
This is just... flakes. 
Okay, stay right there. 
 Sally, you must learn to cook. 
How far do you think you're going to go with just a fabulous body and the intellect of a genius? 
 The box had a picture of a chicken on it. 
I shaked it, I baked it. What 
else am I supposed to do with it? 
Why don't you ask Mrs. 
Muller? Get close to her. 
I'm sure she knows how to cook something. 
Do I have to? 
 Yes. They're plump. We're emaciated. 
You do the maths. 
Making a friend is so simple. 
You may not be as good at it as I am, but I command you to try. 
 What is the point? 
We're not going to learn about humans by watching television. 
We have to mix ourselves among them, walk a mile in their pants. 
I just don't know how to talk to women. 
I'm sure you can find something to say to her. 
You could walk on the beach and discuss itching. 
Oh, how exciting. 
I am so glad I get to be the woman. 
Next planet, I get to be something big with horns. 
Okay, so the shake 'n bake is just a cocoon for the chicken. 
 Yep. 
And chiclets are not chicken at all, right? 
You're not from Ohio, are you? 
 No. 
I can tell. 
I don't envy you having to take care of three men. 
I only got Frank, and he's a full-time job. 
Just once I'd like to see that man pick up a sock. 
I'd like to see men put their dirty dishes in the sink. 
I'd like to see them do laundry. 
I'd like to see them crammed between two steel wheels and ground into a fine paste You know, I'd like to see that myself. 
You let me know. 
Oh, you're dangerous. 
 Oh, yes, I am. 
I like you. 
You can come by anytime. 
I will. 
But do me a favor, before you settle down and get married, you have some fun. 
If I had your figure, I'd find some old millionaire in Florida and slowly suck the life out of him. 
I have the very equipment to do that. 
I'm sure you do. 
Hi, neighbor. 
 Hey, how're you doin'? 
Harry, Tommy, this is Frank, my friend. 
Yeah, hi. 
 Is this place magnificent? 
It's the garage mahal. 
Well you've gotta have someplace to get away from the clucking. 
Ooh, color. 
60 channels of it. 
Knock yourself out. 
Dick, look. Debbie says 
that the new promax router can handle even the wildest curves. 
I don't know if Debbie realizes that can be taken two ways. 
Frank, this is new. 
What is it? 
A back scratcher. 
 May I? 
Be my guest. 
Oh! Oh, this 
is heavenly. 
That spot has been driving me nuts ever since we landed. Oh! 
Please, keep it. 
Really? 
I've never received a gift before. 
I have to give you something, take Tommy. 
Frank! 
 That's the boss calling. 
You know, it's fascinating, every time his wife calls, he jumps. 
See you around. 
 You can count on it. I like you, Frank. 
After all the time I've spent at the university, it's refreshing to meet someone who doesn't pretend to be smart. 
"Jerry dates a blind girl. Repeat." 
Jerry dates a blind girl. 
You know, it gains nothing the second time. 
This has been a rebroadcast of the 11 o'clock news. 
We will resume programming at 6:00 a.m. 
It's the snow show. 
I saw this one last night. 
So what do we do now? 
Why don't we go visit our friends, the Mullers? 
lets. 
 Great! Will they be home? 
It's 3:00 in the morning. 
Where else would they be? 
Hi, neighbor. 
 Whwhat's the matter? 
Nothing. 
 It's 3:00 in the morning. 
Patty said I could drop by anytime. 
Don't worry, we brought gifts. 
A flank steak for milady and "the Tv guide crossword" for monsieur. 
And by the way, the answer to "I blank Lucy" isn't what you think. 
Who is this? 
 That's my daughter Cindy. She's in college. 
My compliments. 
She's a definite triumph of aerobics over genetics. 
I think someone would like to see her naked. 
So, let's fire up the barbecue. 
Frank, if you're in danger, shout! 
Go back to sleep! 
 You seem upset, Frank. 
Go home. 
 Why? 
Maybe they want to have sex. 
 Again? 
Excuse me? 
 It's not what you're thinking. 
It's just that we're so fascinated by you. 
We've never met anyone of your economic class before. 
My class? 
Like you're so much better than we are? 
Well, yes, but you'll evolve. 
And until then, we can still be friends. 
Friends?! 
You are not my friend. 
We're best friends. 
No, we're not! 
Get the hell outta here! 
And another thing. 
Get your precious car off my property! 
Fine! We can tell 
when we're not wanted. 
We're not wanted. 
Ohhhh. 
It seems that some of the... 
subtler principles of electron motion were beyond everyone's grasp. 
Be thankful it's just a grade. 
In most places, this kind of performance gets you a spanking that still burns when you're blown out the airlock. 
Dr. Solomon, are you at least 
going to grade us on a curve? 
Of course not.. 
I grade on a transient loop. 
What? 
 It's very simple. 
Your expected score is located here, the parameters of your actual performance are here, here and here, driving the expectation versus performance data into the last three loops, two of which can't be seen because, of course, they're factored only in time. 
So is my "a" still an "a"? 
Oh, Caryn. 
No. 
This shouldn't be all that difficult for you. 
The interactions of elementary particles are far simpler than the interactions between people. 
For example.. Leon, 
do you have any friends in this class? 
Well, sometimes I talk to Caryn. 
So Caryn is your friend? 
 Yes. 
I see. Pitman, you and 
bug are friends, right? 
Yeah, since third grade. 
We used to trade underwear on sleepovers. 
Shut up. 
And this friendship weathers all circumstance, survives the frictions of daily life completely intact? 
Absolutely. 
 Yeah, totally. 
Even though he obviously thinks you're stupid? 
You think I'm stupid? 
Only in a good way. 
So there you have it.. 
friendship, obviously just a big waste of time. 
And yet everyone on the planet gets all worked up about these pointless little behaviours, blissfully unaware of the great vaporizing meteor due in 2015... 
which obviously doesn't exist because I'm kidding. 
Patty, thanks for letting Harry come along. 
He's a little traumatized by all the tension at home. 
Wheee eeeeee! 
So does Frank know you're with me? 
No, I told him I was setting a perm. 
Does Dick know you're with me? 
No, I injected him with a sedative. 
I've got at least two more hours. 
Ooh, like "Thelma & Louise," except we just came to the supermarket and we haven't murdered anyone. 
It's early yet. 
They're so stubborn. Why 
do men have to be that way? 
I'm still trying to figure out their fascination with burping the alphabet. 
Now, the key to tomatoes is you gotta squeeze 'em. 
If they're soft, they're ready. 
This one's ready. 
I'm the high commander! 
When our interests are challenged... 
 What are you watching now? 
It's the president Clinton show. 
He looks good on camera, but his show is incredibly dull. 
Dick, are you all right? 
 I'm fine. 
No, you're not. 
 Yes, I am. 
Okay, but your back is starting to bleed. 
I wish I had a remote. 
Frank had a remote. 
If you like Frank so much, why don't you go live at Frank's house? 
Sit down. 
What is your big problem? 
Nothing. I just 
reached out to Frank, and he kicked me in the teeth because Frank hates me for no good reason. 
But, hey, that's Frank. 
 Humans are not perfect. 
Well, that's a convenient excuse, isn't it? 
You just can't admit when you're wrong. 
 Oh, please. 
It's not like I've never bonded with a life-form, lieutenant. 
Yes, yes, we know. 
You've bonded beautifully with creatures on nine different systems. 
And those that wouldn't bond we ate. 
It's different here, Dick. 
To bond with a human, you have to give and take, like me and patty. 
It's not worth the trouble. 
I can be perfectly content as a disaffected loner. 
Was that you? 
No... and I 
always tell you. 
Someone's towing away the rambler. 
It's Muller! 
why is he taking the car? 
Because he knows I love it. 
I told you, Solomon.. 
eight inches over my property!  Ha! 
Dick, what's wrong? 
 I don't know. 
There's an odd sensation moving through my body. 
Whooo.... the hell does 
that stupid sack of fat think he is anyway?! 
Dick? 
 I have a plan. 
Remember, we're not allowed to liquify humans. 
Okay, I have another plan. 
That's it. I'm invoking a 
supreme directive. 
I'll need witnesses. 
What is it? 
 I want you to remember who you are. 
I'm the high commander. 
 And what is the high commander's oath? 
As high commander, I vow to handle all problems with strength and deliberation. 
I will strive to understand other life-forms. 
I will avoid aggression and make peace with all those who piss me off. 
What are you doing here? 
We've come to apologize and make a peace offering. 
So the great professor offers the lowly chump a present and makes it better. 
 That's what we're hoping. 
It's a double-sleeved roller bearing. 
Look, you can talk down to me, you can wake me up at 3:00 in the morning, but you can't buy me off. 
It's cambered. 
 Get out! 
Aren't you listening, chunky? He's apologizing. 
Now, now, now.. we are not 
going to sink down to his level. 
My level? 
You people always go straight to the snob stuff. 
Who are you calling "people"? 
You want a piece of me, huh? 
You want a piece, huh? 
Oh! 
You want to fight? 
Come on! Come on! 
That's enough. 
 Get your hands off of me. 
Sorry. 
 Idon'tlike it! 
Please don't do that. 
 Oh, yeah, what are you gonna do about it? 
Huh? Huh? Huh? 
Egghead! Brainiac! 
Dick, I am so disappointed in you. 
I don't know what happened. I just lost control. 
Yeah, well, you hurt a human. 
 We are in so much trouble. What if he talks? 
He won't if we finish him off. 
 This is awful! 
Well, you should feel awful, pal. 
 But I don't. 
I feel better, and powerful. 
This is why people have friends.. 
so they can hit them. 
This is incredible. It's 
the best I've ever felt! 
Well, there's the down side. 
Hi. 
 Hi. 
I'm so sorry about all this. 
but Frank can be such an idiot. 
How's your brother? 
Is he licking his wounds? 
He tried, but he couldn't reach 'em, so he made Harry do it. 
Hello. 
You let sleeping dogs lie, Frank Muller. 
This is guy stuff. Don't 
get your panties in a wad. 
That's some good advice, thanks. 
So, uh, how're you doin'? 
I'm swollen, thank you. 
 So am I. 
Why are you suddenly so civil? 
Now we understand each other's boundaries. 
You know my limits. 
I know your limits. 
Now we can respect each other. 
Wait, let me see if I can get this straight. 
In order to achieve each other's respect, you had to resort to violent confrontation. 
Now, doesn't that strike you as stupid? 
Kids, huh? 
 They don't understand the world. 
So, uh, we still friends? 
Sure. 
Okay, I finished my letter. 
"Dear president Clinton, I've seen your program on TV, and I think you need help. 
Maybe in the next episode there could be gunfire or even some explosions. 
I know I'd like that. 
Thanks for letting me share my thoughts.. 
oh, I forgot to include my name and address. 
You know, patty is a woman of unexpected depth and wisdom. 
She does things with contact paper most women can only dream of. 
I think I finally understand this compelling urge to make friends. 
It isn't intellectual at all. 
These bodies have a basic physical need for other people. 
Well, in a biology this primitive, there are bound to be a few weaknesses. 
But that's the paradox. 
It's not a weakness. 
That need is what brings them together, and that unity is an enormous source of power. 
Yeah, it's powerful, all right, but it's dangerous. 
There are some urges we're just going to have to learn to control. 
Whoa! Their 
daughter's home. 
As many intelligent people know, aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
And...well, they had an extra seat. 
The Earth revolves around the sun But ask more humans, and they'll say.. 
..it revolves around them. 
It's such a beautiful night. 
Harry, why don't you come out and look at the stars with us? 
Oh, no, you're not putting me out for the night again. 
Fool me once, shame on you, Fool me six times, shame on me. 
What are you babbling about now? 
Oh it's just something I learned from this self-help tape I bought at the yard sale down the block. 
Dr. Martin Blaine's path to 
personal transformation: say yes to you. 
This is going to help me solve my confidence problem. 
Why do you have a confidence problem? What, are you stupid? 
Tommy, why aren't you looking at the stars? 
I have too much studying to do, Dick. 
Your homework is taking up way too much of your time. 
Tell me about it. They've 
changed phys ed to health class, and I have to memorize 287 different body parts. 
You have an owner's manual? 
Well, here's a picture of all the different organs in our abdominal cavity. 
Oh, my god! 
You know, I read someplace that you can stretch a man's nerve endings from new York to San Francisco, but he would die. 
Hey look, here's a section on virginity and abstinence. 
I haven't experienced sex yet, so... 
I guess that makes me a virgin. 
 Congratulations. 
Thanks. It feels 
kind of weird, you know. 
I mean, I'm proud of it, but I'm also a little embarrassed. 
Is there anything that men have that they're both proud and ashamed of at the same time? 
No. 
 Drawing a blank. 
Ezekiel Begat Jedidiah. 
Jedidiah Begat Ephraim. 
Ephraim Begat Lemuel. 
Man, these people Begat their brains out. 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
 Yeah. 
When's your birthday? 
 My what? 
I'm updating the office birthday list. When's your birthday? 
Do I have to tell you? 
 What, are you pleading the fifth? 
Er..the fifth sounds fine. 
This month. 
Ah, that's this Monday. 
How old will you be? 
Why do I have to tell you a specific number? Are you keeping score? 
Well If you're going to get sensitive, never mind. 
I just don't see why age is so important. 
I've guess you've got a milestone creeping up on you. 
No. No, that's 
my underwear. 
Good morning. 
 Hello, Dr. Albright. 
Ah, Laurie, Dr. Solomon. 
Laurie ivers. 
Hello. 
 Hello. 
My, you have a firm handshake. 
Thanks..Laurie's visiting the 
campus for a few days. 
You are in really excellent condition. 
Thank you. I work out a lot. 
 I can tell. 
It's very firm. 
Laurie's studying for her doctorate in anthropology. 
She's considering coming here to Pendleton. 
oh, well, you've chosen a very mediocre institution, and we'd love to have you. 
Thanks. 
Would you shake my hand again? 
Um, I suppose. 
Ah, Nina, why don't you take Laurie to the library to show her the Inca exhibit? 
Exhibit? It's three coins and a spoon. 
Don't spoil it for her, just take her. 
err, It was nice meeting you. 
What a coincidence. 
It was nice meeting you. 
Oh, will you act your age? 
 What has my age have to do with it? 
Like you didn't know. 
 I don't know. 
Well, I do. 
 What are we talking about? 
All I know is that when I was Laurie's age, I did not appreciate having middle-Aged men fawn over me. 
You were once her age? 
Yes, believe it or not. 
Very well. 
Not it is. 
Now, you say Mrs. Dubcek 
brought it to us? 
Uh-huh. 
What do you think it wants? 
What is it trying to tell us? 
The thing that scares me the most are the little oranges in its stomach. 
Hello, I'm Dr. Martin Blaine. 
Come join me on a path to personal transformation. 
Say yes to you. 
 Yes. 
First of all, you should learn to be comfortable talking about yourself. 
When asked your name, you should say it loud and clear. 
Let's try this out. 
What's your name? 
That's a great name. 
What is your primary goal? 
Harry Solomon. 
Tommy! Sally! 
Harry, come in here. 
Duh !, what's that? 
Don't worry. 
We've killed it. 
Sit down. We have to talk. 
 Sally: what is it? 
There's an important detail that we forgot to attend to. 
We need birthdays. 
 No, thank you. 
This guy I saw at a restaurant had a birthday, they set his food on fire and then blew on it. 
Well, nevertheless, we have to have them and we have to know how old we are. 
For some reason, we're expected to act our age, and we don't even know what that is. 
How are we supposed to figure it out? 
We're smart. 
We'll guess. 
How old would you say I am? 
I'm going to say 35. 
What's so funny? 
 It just kind of sounds ridiculous. 
Okay, 39. 
 Hello. Come on. 
40? 
41, 2, 3, 4? 
Uh... 5! 5! 5! 45! Yeah. 
45'S fine. Body's 
broken in. It's still solid. 
Not too old to have sex. 
Uh, commander, permission to speak freely? 
Permission granted. 
Humans over 35 cannot have sex. 
 No! 
Give it up. 
It's over. 
Well, why? They have 
the same equipment. 
Cause it's gross, that's why. 
How old are you? 
 14. 
Well can you have sex? 
 Well, I'm not supposed to. 
Why not? - Apparently, I have 
my whole life ahead of me. 
Dick, can I be 70? 
Why? 
 Well, that Paul Newman guy is 70, and people are always saying that he looks great. 
Done. You're 70. 
And? 
 You look great. 
Ok, Sally, how old are you? 
Well... 
whatever the perfect age is, I'm it. 
I mean, maybe I got stuck with being a woman, but at least I'm in my prime. 
Check out how firm this is, huh? 
You know, if I was a guy, I'd be all over me right now. 
If I was a guy, I would be, too. 
Now that you boys are going through the road to manhood, I'm sure many of you have noticed certain... feelings. 
What is it, Solomon? 
 What kind of feelings? 
You know what kind of feelings. 
 No, I don't. 
You'll know 'em when you get 'em, hmm? 
Now, they're perfectly normal. 
For god's sake, don't act on 'em. 
Er, sorry, you're losing me. 
You play sports, you focus on your schoolwork, and when you take a shower, you wash your hair and get the hell out of there. 
Oh, you're talking about sex! 
Yes. 
 Great! Great. 
Tell me exactly how it's done. 
Well, you're... men, 
and your male and your female, they have these... 
certain parts, that are, uh... 
how do you call, uh...? 
complementary to each other. 
These parts come into play... 
and that's how we all were born. 
I'm sorry, but can we get somebody who's actually had sex to teach this class? 
Thanks for showing me around the campus today. 
You know, you are really a lot of fun. 
 I know. 
Laurie, I was having a discussion with a young man last night, and he said that someone my age was too old to.. 
well, just too old. 
That is so typical of our culture. 
You know, in many ancient societies, like the Incas, age was worshiped and revered. 
That's all I'm asking for. 
Exactly when does puberty end for a man? 
Six months after death. 
Guys my age are always trying to prove something, not like older men. 
They've been there. 
They've done it. It shows. 
Oh like you. You've really 
got your head together. 
Actually, it came that way. 
Well, I'd better get moving. 
You are moving. Everything 
on this planet is moving. 
You are so clever. 
 Oh, no. 
Well, bye, Dr. Albright. 
 Bye. 
So, see ya. 
 Because you're still looking. 
You can breathe now. 
Hey, if you could change one thing about me, what would it be? 
Nothing. 
 Bingo. 
Doesn't get any better than this, huh? 
Check this out. See how this 
curves in right here, right? 
Watch this. 
Upsy-Daisy. 
Springs back just like a cat. 
Laurie says that men my age should be worshiped and revered, like the Incas. 
Don't you think that's right? 
 Oh Yes. 
The Incas would take a prominent man, like you, and they would anoint him with oils, adorn him with robes, and then the high priest would cut him up and then ram a stick in his head and parade the head through the village, and the young virgins would throw flowers at him. 
What kind of flowers? 
Well, it says here that this is guaranteed to restore your natural luster. 
Oh, Dick, you're getting your luster back. 
That's wonderful. 
How much longer? 
Oh, er..two minutes. 
Welcome back to The Miss Universe Pageant. 
And now we continue with our Parade of Nations. 
Miss Finland. 
Well, they only have contestants from earth. 
I think this pageant is fixed. 
These women should be enormous. 
Miss universe should have her own gravitational pull. 
I think I'm feeling it. 
My primary goal is to meet miss Finland. 
I will meet miss Finland. 
I deserve to meet miss Finland. 
Ooh! Check out the yabos 
on miss Tunisia. 
I deserve those yabos. 
These women, they're all vibrant, healthy, strong, young. 
They're just like Sally. 
Thank you. I've been 
thinking about this. 
Every time I turn on the Tv or open a magazine, I see people like me. 
All the ads are aimed at me. I am what counts. 
I think you're full of something, lieutenant. 
No, no, no, no. If I don't 
watch a Tv show, it's canceled. 
I don't like a soft drink, history. 
If I don't like a certain feminine product with wings, they'll make one with a propeller. 
I am the target demographic. 
Face it, Dick. 
I'm young, hot and all-powerful. 
You just said yes to you. 
I'm done. 
How do I look? 
Um... Dick, 
um... okay, 
if somebody were helping you with an experiment, and things went awry, and you became horribly disfigured, you wouldn't hold it against them, now would you? Why? What happened? 
Nothing. Destroy 
all the mirrors now! 
No, no! 
I've got to see! 
Oh, my god! 
I'm gorgeous! 
Good morning, Nina. 
Well! 
Good morning. 
I was going to ask what you did this weekend, but I think it's painfully clear. 
By the way, happy birthday. 
hmm... 
brace yourself. 
Hello.. 
oh, my god! 
What's the matter? 
Nothing. 
Laurie called me last night. 
 Really? 
What did she say? 
What was that? 
 What? 
That squeaking. 
Why I have no idea. 
What did Laurie say when you talked to her? 
She's decided to come here next year. 
Oh, isn't that nice? 
Yes. 
Um... 
could you walk over there and get me that pencil? 
But you have one right on your desk. 
I know, but... 
I need that one. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Oh, I got you a birthday card. 
Hmm. "Happy birthday. 
You look like a million dollars. 
Oh! 
Old and wrinkled. 
What kind of a cruel hoax is this? 
It's a hallmark card. 
A hallmark of degradation! 
The first line lulled me into a false sense of security, and the second line ripped out my heart, and slapped me across the face with it, awakening me to harsh reality. 
 It's an old joke! 
For an old fool! 
Well, I want no part of it. 
I'm leaving, while I still have my dignity. 
Congratulations, you have completed your path to personal transformation. 
Say yes to you. 
 Yes. 
And never forget, when the world gets you down, stay positive. 
I'm almost completely sure that I will. 
Damn! A wrinkle! 
I've peaked! 
The truth is, time measured in years, would have no significance at all. 
If a second-rate sun hadn't pulled this planet, into the little suck party we call gravity, causing everything on it to wither... and die. 
Thoughts on that? Bug? 
It doesn't look dyed to me. 
Let me simplify. 
If a year is not a year anywhere but earth, what does that make time in the universe? 
Leon, time is what? 
Don't think, Leon. 
Just answer. Time is what? 
Take a shot. Go! 
 Time is relative? 
My god, Leon, you're right! 
My head hurts. 
Leon, I have a follow-up question. 
Sorry, time is up. 
Oh, and by the way, you're all 55 minutes older. 
Dr. Solomon. 
 Laurie. 
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye. 
And I couldn't say good-bye without your leaving. 
Oh, you changed your hair. 
Finally, someone noticed. 
Laurie, car's outside. 
Oh, I'll be right there. 
 Who's that? 
Oh that's Doug. 
He's my boyfriend. 
But I thought you only liked older men. 
I do. He's 29. 
Bye. 
Dr. Solomon, 
there you are. 
Remember we were supposed to meet in your office? 
Oh forgive me, My tired brain forgot, while your youthful synapses stored the information, and retrieved them, ssst, like a flash. 
Okay, I'll come back. 
Leon, let me ask you something. 
Let's say that two people of different ages met at a university. 
One is older but dashing, the other, youthful and stimulating. 
They obviously enjoy each other's company, but the age difference keeps asserting itself. 
Do you think that that should make a relationship impossible? 
Dr. Solomon, are you 
coming on to me? 
Oh! Never mind! 
Oh, Dick. 
Your posture tells me you've got the blues. 
Let my positive energies, spark you out of your doldrums and into a happier.. 
oh, go away. 
 I will. And thanks for listening. 
Hello. 
How're you feeling? 
 Like a million dollars. 
I thought I'd try this again. Oh, here. 
Happy birthday... 
from Dr. Albright. 
You wrote this yourself. 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
It's just lovely. 
You're welcome. 
Dr. Albright, 
have I been a perfect ass? 
Nobody's perfect. 
Why do I have to be this age? 
You're focusing too much on the container. 
This body is not you. 
I know that. 
 No, you don't. 
Trust me, I do. 
 No, I don't think you do. 
If you think, No..shut up. 
You're only on this earth a short amount of time. 
Well, that was the plan. 
Listen, if we're over the hill, we might as well enjoy the ride down. 
Thank you for saying "we". 
It just slipped out. 
You know, the light of the moon is so magical. 
It shows me what you must have looked like, so many years ago. 
That was... 
almost beautiful. 
So, this is your favorite spot. 
It's so... 
cheap. 
I think gray hair makes you look distinguished. 
Thank you. I think you would 
look distinguished with gray hair. 
No, I don't think so. 
Men look distinguished with gray hair. 
Women just look old. 
When women get breasts, they look sexy. 
When men get breasts, they look old. 
Good point. 
How old are you? 
How old are you? 
 You first. 
No, you first. 
 You. 
42. 
 Me, too! 
You notice how this James Brown is always getting somewhere? 
He's getting up, getting down, getting back. 
We should contact him.. I mean, as part of 
our mission to study life on this planet. 
Yes, but according to this, he's more of a machine, a sex machine. 
Oh, look! 
It's the campus police. 
Is there some kind of problem? 
 Ooh, actually, yes. 
There's a star missing right there. 
And we think we know who did it. 
This is your family? 
 Why, yes. 
That's exactly what we were going for. 
Sally's the woman. I'm the tall, 
dashing man. Tommy is the adolescent. 
And Harry is... 
the funny looking one. 
I'm gonna have to see your driver's license, please. 
Why? We're not driving. 
We're parked. 
Yeah, but you're parked on university property. 
Oh, I am university property. 
Here's my photo I.D. 
It's just my head, but I assure you the rest of me is anatomically correct. 
Well, Dr. Solomon, 
it's 2:00 A.M. 
So, let's pack this up and move it out. 
 Right away. 
Dick, what's a driver's licence? 
It must be some kind of human validation. 
We should get one if we're going to blend in. 
 I'm on it. 
Listen. 
It's that guy again. 
God, it's amazing. How does he 
sing like that? 
Dick, remember how I said I wanted to learn to sing? 
I've changed my mind. 
As many intelligent people know.. 
.. aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of four such explorers. 
Where are you? 
Very well, I can wait. 
You're not watching me. 
I'm not watching you. 
You're somewhere in the room, I can feel it. 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
 Yah! 
What is it, Nina? 
 Here's the mail. 
Oh, it's a letter for Dr. Albright. 
She'll hold this in her delicate hand, insert a finger and rip through the mucilage. 
She's just wonderful. 
I knew you had a thing for her. 
Yes, but I understand I'm not allowed to show it to her without her permission. 
Good morning, Dr. Albright. 
Good morning, Dr. Albright. 
 Good morning. 
Dr. Solomon, I was just thinking of you. 
 You were? 
Yes. I have a meeting with the 
rules committee on Friday night, and I just can't make it. 
It's too late to try and get out of it now, unless you can talk some idiot into replac.. 
oh. 
You look wonderful. Is that a new jacket? 
 I'm entirely new. 
Everyone on the rules committee wants to meet you. - Really? 
Oh we all think of you as the resident genius. 
oh please, I need you to substitute for me. 
You need me? 
I never dreamed that I would be the man you needed. 
I need you desperately. 
Let me know if it's going to get any deeper. 
I'm wearing open-Toed shoes. 
I'm not prepared. 
 It's a dull, mindless group. 
It's "the night of the teaching dead." 
Maybe I can shake things up with some fresh ideas. 
No one there would recognize a fresh idea if it bit them on the ass. 
Just pass these out for me, please. 
All right, I'll do it. 
Oh, thanks. 
You've saved me. 
Well, I am a manly man. 
Well done. 
 Another five minutes, and he would have given me a kidney. 
Next! 
I can't believe how much we have to go through to get a licence. 
Yeah. Then why 
are we here? 
Because I want one. 
If I have to be the woman, I'm not about to be stuck at home. 
 Mmhmm. 
"Stay behind orange line". 
That's why nobody ever gets to the window. 
Hey, let's pull up the slack here. 
Oh! There must be some sort of 
flesh-melting force field at the orange line. 
Next! 
 NoOoo! 
I'm sorry. 
You know, cars must have some huge power we haven't discovered yet. 
Look at this.. the lines, 
the waiting, the testing. 
Can you imagine what you must have to go through to get a gun? 
Next! 
What is it they don't get? 
That woman says "next". 
The first person goes to the window. 
The second person moves to the orange line, becoming first. 
The third person becomes second, and the rest of us pull up the slack! 
There are just too many gaps in this line. 
We should each only be a single person-thickness apart. 
Good point. 
I think everyone should hear it. 
You think so? 
Okay, people, listen up and nobody gets hurt! 
Tommy, have you been sitting in that same chair all day? 
Hmm, let me think about this one...Yeah! 
You're supposed to be experiencing human adolescent behavior. 
Well, as an adolescent, everything annoys me, especially the sound of your voice right now. 
Nothing. - yes you did. 
I did not. 
 Don't try to blame it on me. 
Did you get your license? 
 We were thrown out. 
On the bright side, we did outrun the police. 
What went wrong? 
Everything. What do people have to do 
on this planet to get what they want? 
Today Dr. Albright wanted 
something from me. All she did was ask. 
What did she say? 
 She said she needed my help and I looked wonderful and I'm a genius. 
She said that? 
 About you? 
Yes. 
 And you bought it? 
Well, I am the high commander. 
Wait a minute, something about this doesn't wash. 
She's doing something. 
Now I remember, I read about this. 
She's distorting the truth. 
Dr. Albright would 
never lie to me. 
Ohh wake up and snort the coffee. 
Just because you don't lie doesn't mean people here don't. 
We're colleagues. 
I trust her. 
I command you to be more like her. 
Like what? 
 Like a woman. 
Fine. I can woman. 
 Good. 
Commander, permission to speak freely? 
 Granted. 
As the oldest member of this crew, I feel it's my duty to inform you all that this planet both wipes and sucks... 
in that order. 
What is your problem? 
Something's wrong. 
My transfer's not holding. 
I'm growing hair, and my armpits smell, and there's a constant circus in my pants. 
Aw, our old man is becoming a boy. 
No, no I'm serious. 
The seal's broken, and I'm losing oil. 
Look at this. 
ooh! What is it? 
It's a nipple. 
What am I going to do about it? 
 I don't know, but until we figure it out, maybe you should sleep in the shower. 
Gentlemen, we have a guest member of the rules committee with us tonight. 
Dr. Solomon, would you 
care to share with us some of Dr. Albright's feelings? 
 Oh, yes, of course. 
Well, first, on behalf of Dr. Albright, 
I would like to say welcome to this big waste of time. 
I'd say I've always wanted to put a face with those men whom she affectionately calls "the night of the teaching dead". 
And may I say you do not disappoint. 
I can tell at a glance that you indeed are a mindless and dull group. 
So, I would like to start with a fresh idea that you won't recognise when it bites you on the ass. 
Excuse me, does Dr. Albright 
know you're speaking on her behalf? 
Don't move! 
Stay where you are! 
Dr. Solomon.. 
 Freeze! He's still there! 
Oh! You have 
a mole. 
A big, ugly mole. 
Well, you're in early. 
Dr. Byron told me about 
your little speech. 
Sorry I missed it. 
Rest assured, I gave you full credit. 
What the hell are you trying to do? 
Ruin me? 
It will take me weeks to repair the damage left in your wake. 
Weeks. 
All you had to do was show up and feign interest. 
Feign? I will not be 
a party to feigning. 
I always tell the complete truth. 
The truth? Then I will be brutally Frank. 
Good, I'll be genuine Dick. 
I thought, foolishly, this would be a good opportunity for my colleagues to get to know you. 
No one wanted to meet you. 
I made that up. 
So you lied? 
I was bending the truth to flatter you. There's a difference. 
Oh I see. So when we met, you 
said you were pleased to meet me. 
Was that a lie or "truth-bending"? 
 "Figure of speech". 
And when you said you were impressed with my r�sum�? - "Light conversation". 
When I moved in, you said you didn't mind sharing your office? 
"Diplomacy". 
Anything else? 
Yes, is that really the color of your hair? 
 Absolutely! 
You're upset, aren't you? 
Tell the truth. 
 Yes. 
I thought I could trust you. I can't. 
Trust me? You're the one 
who lied and tricked me. 
No. It's not how you 
lie to trick someone. 
First, you start by.. you 
have something on your tie. 
Ah-ha, very clever. 
Yes, I see how that works. You 
have something on your shoulder. 
That's not how it works. 
This is how it works. 
Your shirt tail's on fire. 
That's how. 
Your blouse is on fire. 
Stop.. get 
your hands off me! 
Don't move! 
Whyyy! 
That was my fly. 
I know. 
On the subject of universal truth, Albert Einstein once said.. 
any thoughts on that? 
Anyone? Yes, Caryn. 
Dr. Solomon, I think 
you were speaking German. 
Er yes, German. 
Einstein spoke German. 
Okay, I'll simplify. 
"Scientific proof is nothing more than conditional truth". 
We all understand what truth is, don't we? 
Now, I have three of Einstein's equations on the board. 
Two of them are false, and one is true. 
Who can spot the true one? Anyone? 
How many of you think it's number one? 
I'll give you a hint: it's not number one. 
Here's another hint: it's not number two. 
How many of you think it's number three? 
Well, you're wrong. 
I lied. I made them all up! 
You see, lying accomplishes nothing. 
You can't trust someone who lies. 
You work with them. You think you 
know them. They ask you to substitute. 
You make a fool of yourself. They get mad. 
And your sister can't even get a driver's licence. 
Dr. Solomon, is this 
going to be on the final? 
The point I'm making is, you have to tell the absolute truth, or else you just end up confusing people. 
But, Dr. Solomon, sometimes 
you just can't tell the truth. 
But why not? 
Anyone? 
Leon, I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to tell me the complete truth. 
This won't affect my grade? 
Absolutely not. 
What do you think of me? 
Uh... you make me 
really nervous. 
I don't know what's going on half the time, and when you walk around the room, I'm always afraid you're going to hit me in the back of the head. 
Thank you. 
There, you see...the truth. 
By the way, Leon, you're failing. 
I thought you said it wouldn't affect my grade. 
It didn't. 
Anybody home? 
Anyb-- Oh, hi. 
I brought you folks your extra key. 
Yeah, right. 
Good excuse. 
You just wanted to come up here and stare at pimple boy. 
You poor kid. I remember 
how it feels to be your age. 
Yeah, I remember how it feels to be your age. 
Listen, I'm going to go out and get some smokes. You want to take a ride? 
Yeah, whatever. 
It's really not fair. I can 
grow a pimple but not a mustache. 
What's your secret? 
Solomon, Sally. 
 Here. 
You failed the written exam. 
Come back in three weeks. 
I can't come back. 
I can't. 
Sorry, those are the rules. 
 I need a licence now. 
I'm the woman. 
I really need your help. 
You must be a genius. 
Your line is so big, but it moves so fast. 
Well, I do my best. 
There's got to be some way you can help me. 
I mean, I know you have a heart in that.. 
big,hairy, wonderful chest of yours. 
I bet pretty girls beg you all the time, huh? 
Okay, you can take the test again. 
Thank you. 
I could get very good at this. 
Hey, what did you put under "weight"? 
Tommy, are you all right? 
Where have you been? 
The mall, Dick. 
I was at the mall. 
It may be the most emotionally satisfying place I've ever been. 
Were you able to observe other life-forms? 
Definitely. 
Everybody there was as oily and disgusting as me. 
It was a food court of mutants, a catalog of horrors, a freak show, and I was their lizard king. 
Oh. What do you do 
when you're there? 
Hang. 
 What do you see? 
Stuff. 
I belong now. 
Oh, yeah, stay out of my room! 
Dick? Dick, look, 
I got my driver's licence. 
According to this, you're a 55-year-old, 300-pound Asian woman. 
And an organ donor. 
Dick, I got my driver's permit, too. 
Yes, I expected you would. 
I just want to say that I not only accomplished my goal, but... I've discovered 
a softer place within myself, and it is all because of you and your extraordinary ability to command. 
Thank you, lieutenant. 
 You have so many facets to admire, time prohibits my naming them all. 
Shall I speak of your courage, how you've led a ragtag crew of misfits across the galaxies, fueled by your brave spirit? 
Or shall I confess that your boyish good looks are stunted only by your personal bigness? 
Oh, where to begin simply exhausts my feminine mind. 
What are you doing? 
 Lying. 
You like it? 
 It's incredible. 
I love it! 
 Really? 
Yes! How did you do it? 
 Anybody can do it. 
Look at me, I've just done it once, and here I am, whipping it out there. 
I thought the truth was potent, but it's nothing compared to this. 
This makes me feel powerless and susceptible, and ready to yield to your every.. 
I've got to find Dr. Albright. 
This is Wednesday. She 
calls it "over the hump day". 
I don't know what that means , but I know where she humps. 
Tommy, we're going out. 
I'll drive. 
 No, I'll drive. 
Dick... 
Harry called it. 
Shotgun. 
 I don't want to ride in the back. 
Dr. Albright, hello. 
Hello. Sorry we don't 
have a chair for you. 
Not a problem. 
You know Dr. Byron. 
 Yes, of course. 
You really should have that thing removed. It's all I can look at. 
Excuse me. 
 I looks like there's just the two of us. 
I'll have a pitcher of that stuff. 
May I see your driver's license? 
 You bet you can. 
Okay, Mrs. Wu. 
I discovered something today, and I really need to try it out. 
Thorazine. 
I'll get you some water. 
You see, you know these things. 
You're so smart, and your... 
your looks.. 
your looks are like... 
a beer tap, a golden rush of drunken beauty with a nice head which spills all down your blouse, leaving you sweet and pungent. 
That was pathetic. 
Well, I'm sorry I'm not as good a liar as you are. 
Well, I'm sorry. 
I'm leaving. 
Wait! You're not 
finished with me yet! 
Do you mind? 
We're talking. 
Okay, you win. 
What is it? 
 I've realized something. 
I can't lie to you. 
I wish I could. 
It's just not something that I'm good at, like.. like... 
actually, I'm good at everything. 
 Can I tell you the truth? 
 Why not? 
The real truth is, you're delightful. 
I love looking into your face. 
I don't know what it is about you this evening, maybe it's the way the light hits your eyes, maybe it's the wine, but you look puffy.. you 
should go home and sleep. 
There. 
Is that better? 
Sadly, yes. 
May I walk you home? 
And be honest. 
Okay. 
You know, if someone had told me a year ago that I'd be driving a car and sucking the flesh off a dead bird, I'd have called 'em a liar. 
Being human is far more complex than I thought. 
There is no absolute personal truth here, and these bodies don't come with an owner's manual. 
So every day these people have to make up life, and truth becomes highly individual. 
Oh, my god, Dick, what if this lying thing falls into the hands of the politicians? 
Ooh, that's a horrifying thought. 
I think these humans bend the truth because this is a difficult place to live. 
It's a lonely blue dot on the far end of the galaxy. 
And all the half-truths and flattery and diplomacy are the lubricant that people spread on each other to get over the rough spots. 
It's a lot easier on our planet. No one ever lies. 
Except, of course, when you don't want to help somebody move. 
I was sick that day. 
 I helped you move. 
I had two boxes. 
Who packed the boxes? 
okay, listen, if we're gonna... 
The force-carrying particles exchanged between matter particles are said to be virtual particles because, unlike real particles, they cannot be directly detected by a particle detector. 
The people on this planet will swallow anything. 
Oooh, finally. 
My pictures of "the today show" gang. 
Ooooh, my favorite Martha Stewart. 
Is it autographed? 
 No, but she signed it She looks good enough to eat. 
So, how was school today? 
 The best ever. 
I had my very first makeout session. 
Good for you. 
 It was with Dina, my lab partner. 
Dina, the one with the...? 
 Oh, yeah. 
So tell us everything. 
I want details. 
Well, at first I was conflicted. 
you know.. we come from very 
different backgrounds. 
I'm an alien, and she's a presbyterian. 
I have a highly developed mind, and she's got that... 
big, pouty mouth. 
I tell you, Dick, it was a tough decision. 
What tipped the scales? 
She let me. 
Well, what happened next? 
Well, I don't know what came over me, but... they 
were so big and round and beautiful, I just had to touch them. 
 And then what? 
She screamed, "ow, my eyes!" and that just... 
basically killed the mood. 
 Damn. 
As many intelligent people know.. 
.. aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of four such explorers. 
It was the best of times. 
It was the worst of times. 
I'm not reading 387 pages if he can't make up his mind in the first sentence. 
Great. Wonderful. 
Thanks for nothing. 
What happened? 
My date for a wedding tomorrow night cancelled at the last minute. 
His brother came out of the coma. 
A wedding? 
 Yeah, a big reception. 
A ritual? 
 Very traditional crying, dancing. 
And the female devours the male immediately after the ceremony? 
No. That's a process that takes 
years and years. 
Nina, are you married? 
 No. 
Why not? What are 
you doing wrong? 
You sound just like my mother. 
That must be very confusing for you. 
oh I wish I didn't Rsvp. I hate 
going to these things by myself. 
I'd love to go to the wedding with you. 
Oh! 
I couldn't ask you to do that at such short notice. 
Oh I don't mind. 
 It's a twohour drive. 
Well I'll pay for the gas. 
 You'd have to wear a suit. 
I'm wearing a suit. 
 A nice suit. 
I'll get one. You can pick it 
out, whatever it takes. I'll do it! 
You're going to make me say this, aren't you?- What? 
It's not that I don't find you charming in your own way. 
It's just that you tend to make a vivid impression on people. 
Well, I am the high commander. 
That's exactly what I'm talking about. 
I promise you I'll be on my best behavior. 
You won't bring any of your family? 
 Just me. 
Fine. 
You can come. 
Excellent! 
My first wedding! 
I can't wait! 
Oh, and be sure to wear something that shows the crack in your breasts. 
I don't know what the school nurse is talking about. I don't see any bug. 
I know. She said 
I probably got it from Dina, but I don't get how, unless the bug swam in with the saliva. 
This is interesting. My throat tickles. 
 Mine, too. 
You know, I tried using a stick to scratch it, but that just brought up a whole new set of problems. 
Okay, Sally, this shirt, this tie, these socks? 
Or this shirt, this tie, these socks? 
 Stop. What's wrong with you? 
I'm sorry, but Mary's counting on me. 
I want to look my best for the wedding. 
What is it with you and that blonde? 
Nothing, this is strictly research. 
But to describe her as blonde is inaccurate. 
Her hair is more like honey with flaxen highlights and just a whisper of gold dancing playfully about the halo that surrounds her. 
So she's not blonde. 
I'm sorry. I guess I just haven't 
seen her through your love goggles. 
I don't love her, this is a perfect opportunity to observe a wedding firsthand. 
There's a lot we don't understand. 
 Like what? 
Well, it's really a very fascinating ritual. 
The ceremony begins with the bride being given away. 
Excuse me. Given away, 
like an object? 
As in "free girl with every large fries"? 
Wait. There's free 
girls? Can I go? 
Fries? Can I go? 
No... I'm afraid not. Dr. 
Albright has already RSVP'd. 
You said you'd stop spelling in front of me. 
Wow! 
What was that? 
I don't know, but I want another one. 
oohhh Ohhh Was it as good for you as it was for me? 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
Good morning. 
Nina, I seem to be having a little trouble swallowing this morning. 
Do you happen to know if there's an alternate stomach access? 
Are you sick? 
Yes, and the novelty is starting to wear off. 
You're sick and you're breathing my air. 
Which air is yours? 
I'll get you some tea. 
 What's this? 
This is brilliant! 
You're sick. You should be home in bed. 
But this is my first date with Dr. Albright. 
Dr. Solomon, I'm sure 
she'll understand. 
oh Nina, please. This is 
very important to me. 
Promise me you won't let Dr. Albright know... 
that... I'm sick. 
She won't hear it from me. 
Good morning. 
 Good morning, Dr. Albright. 
I'm fine, thanks. 
Good. I'm looking 
forward to tonight. 
Aren't you? 
 Absolutely. 
It'll be fun. Why don't you 
pick me up around 7:00-ish? 
7:00-ish on the dot. 
Better make it 6:30. You 
might have trouble park... ing. 
You might, but I'm very good at it. 
Oh, I'm late for class. 
See you tonight. 
 Can't wait. 
oooh.. My head is throbbing. 
Me, too. 
 Mine's worse. 
And my back is aching. 
Me, too. 
 Mine's killing me. 
My breasts feel like two hot steaming bowls of chili. 
She wins. 
This is all your fault. 
You brought a foreign germ into this house. 
Hey, I have as much a right to be here as anybody else. 
See you later. 
I'm not wearing pants. 
I was wondering why the lint brush wasn't working. 
Dick, you are obviously too sick to go. 
Why don't you just stay home and drip fluids with the rest of us? 
Nonsense. I feel 
perfectly fine. 
Dick, I think Sally's right. 
You should just stay home. 
No. Now, help me 
get my pants on. 
And don't worry about me. 
I've never been defeated by a single-celled organism. 
They are stealthy, but they are stupid. 
I am the high commander, and I refuse to let this beat me. 
Okay, fine. If you insist on being stubborn, 
at least take some of this cough syrup. 
I don't need it. 
 Dick, you have to, the lady at the drugstore said if this doesn't work, we have to put a vaporizer in your room. 
Oh, no. 
Yahhh, tastes bad? 
 No. 
I just didn't clear the zipper. 
We are gathered together here in the sight of god and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which is an honorable estate, instituted of god, signifying unto us. 
.and his church, which holy 
estate Christ adorned and. 
now, which of those guys is god? 
Be quiet. 
 Okay, but be sure to introduce me later because I want some answers. 
Shh! Shh! 
 Shh! Shhhh! 
Now, how were those two able to find each other? 
oh, It was fate. 
He's rich. 
She wanted money so she could sit on her ass. I give it a year. 
Oh.. 
that is so beautiful. 
Look at them. 
They belong together. 
Do you think they have any idea how ugly their children will be? 
Ha ha haha. 
Shh! 
 Oh, you shush. 
Shh! 
 Shhhh! 
Oh, this is so moving the love, the closeness. 
Hold me. 
 Oh, get off! 
shh! 
 I don't want to play anymore! 
Whoooo! 
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
I got another hole here. 
Whoooo! 
I made chicken soup. 
It's supposed to make us feel better. 
Ahh! 
Sally, you're amazing. 
As sick as you are, you keep taking care of us. 
 Yeah, I know. 
I don't understand. All I want 
to do is curl up into a ball. 
Yet, somehow I'm compelled to nurture you. 
God, what a cruel disease. 
Why did we choose bodies that could decay so easily? 
I told you we should come here as ducks, but nobody listens to me. 
How could Dina do this to me after I was nice enough to spread the word that she was a good frencher? 
After all the battles I've fought in and all the places I've been, I just can't believe I'm gonna die on a flea-infested little planet in the boondocks of the galaxy. 
in this outfit. 
Now I'll never fall in love, never get used, cheated on, tossed aside like an old shoe. 
I'm glad I'm dying. 
You know, I never told you this, but I always thought you'd make a totally kick-Ass high commander. 
Thanks. 
I've always admired your eloquence. 
What about me? 
No one can take a blow to the head like you, Harry. 
You don't know what that means to me. 
I love you guys. 
I really wish you hadn't wrestled the maid of honor for that. 
Oh I see. Men and women 
are completely equal until something pretty is being given away. 
 Keep your voice down. 
What was with that little girl throwing away flowers? 
What the hell was her problem? 
It's time to leave. 
 Oh, wait. 
I haven't given you your gift yet. 
It's a toaster. 
Where did you get this? 
 In the room full of prizes. 
I'd like to propose a toast to the bride and groom. 
hear, hear. 
To a lifetime of happiness together. 
We give it a year! 
Mary? 
Mary, who is this interesting character you're with? 
Dr. Richard Solomon 
from the university. 
Ah, well, I didn't think that you could top the personal trainer/playwright, but you always come through. 
I'll have you know Dr. Solomon is a highly 
respected scholar and educator. 
He may be a bit eccentric, but he is a wonderfully exciting man. 
I'm sure I'm having a much better time than you are. 
I'm proposing a toast. 
I think I speak for everyone when I say that the most beautiful, radiant woman in the room is not the bride but Mary Albright! 
yes, yes! 
Hi. 
I have a special dish and a special helper today Harry Solomon. 
Harry is an alien. 
I love aliens. 
Mmm, and I love your traditional oyster stuffing, in theory. 
 Thank you. 
Now, you're not feeling very well, are you, Harry? 
Oh, Martha, I feel like I'm going to die. 
Well, you need a reason to live, and I think I have one fall crisp granny smith apple cobbler. 
Mmm! 
A lattice crust. 
Now, open wide. 
Mmm! 
You're not going to die, and that's a good thing. 
Harry. 
Mm-mmm! 
Mmm! Mmm! 
Come in. 
Martha Stewart says I'm not gonna die. 
Is Tommy home? 
 What? Oh, hey, Dina. 
Hey, Tommy. 
 What are you doing here? 
I just came by to see how you're feeling. 
oh well, I'm feeling better, thanks. 
I'm really sorry I gave you the flu. 
oh no, don't worry about it, 'cause anytime you want to give me anything, just let me know, 'cause if I had to do it all over again, I'd do it all over again. 
So is there a chance we could do it all over again? 
We could go to my house. 
Great! Yeah, yeah. 
Who's that? 
Oh this is Dina. 
She's the one that got us sick. 
Destroy the incubator! 
Thank you so much. 
Are you all right? 
 I'm fine. I could stay here all night. 
Not with me. I'm leaving. 
 Very well. 
Wait. 
Listen. It's 4/4 time 
with a half-beat hesitation. 
We have to dance. 
 No, we don't. 
Yo quiero bailar contigo. 
Porteque. 
What? 
Allow me to translate using the universal language. 
of dance! 
Oh, god, we're good! 
Oh, my. oh, my god, 
you're burning up. 
That's right. I'm burning up for you, baby. 
I'm taking you home and putting you to bed. 
 All right! 
We're having sex tonight! 
Ahh! 
Oh, what a lovely place you have. 
Lie down. 
Oh, not there. 
Why didn't you tell me you were sick? 
Dr. Albright? 
 What? 
I'm sick. 
Do you know how dangerous what you did was? 
Yes I know, because I think I'm dying. 
Oh, shush. 
 No, no, let me talk. 
I have to tell you something. 
I don't know how much time I have left, so listen closely. 
If you wake up in the morning, and find a quivelling purple mass, wearing my watch. 
Don't touch it. 
I won't. 
Did you drink this entire bottle? 
I have to tell you this. 
No!, you have to lie down. 
I come from a different world. 
And this is news? 
No, you don't understand. 
I'm an Alien from another planet. 
I'm telling you this because, I love you. 
Whatever you say. 
So much trouble but you are sweet. 
I know. 
Good morning Nina. 
You'll be glad to know that I'm feeling much better. 
I am so happy for you. 
I'm going home. 
Why? 
Because I'm sick that's why. 
Really? what a coincidence. 
Your getting sick just as I'm getting better. 
Have a nice day. 
Doctor Solomon, nice to see you're feeling better. 
Yes, much. 
I want to thank you for coming to the wedding with me. 
I know you were sick. 
Meant a lot to me. 
Oh it was my pleasure. 
You seem to have more teeth than usual. 
You don't remember anything you said to me. do you? 
Did I say anything I shouldn't have? 
Actually, you said a lot of things. 
Could you be a little more specific? 
Oh let's just say you were very revealing. 
I was delirious, I was rambling. 
What did I say? 
You said. 
I love you. 
Isn't that silly? 
That was a close one I wasn't sure we were going to make it. 
Yeah, when I thought I was going to die. 
I told Dr Albright I loved her. 
Why did I do that? 
When you face death you re-asess your priorities. 
I've decided not to get those breast implants. 
You know you have to admire these humans, there lives are so fragile. 
And yet they're so willing to commit their hearts to one another for a lifetime. 
Or an afternoon, with some peachy dish in a mini skirt. 
Hey! hey! at least I'm 
getting some here alright. 
Well said. 
Alright!, We're still 
taking calls on those Ufo sightings. 
I'm on the line with Jennifer who claims to have actually met aliens. 
Gary, I have been sucked up by alien spacecraft many times, Uh-oh. 
 and I can tell you they are among us. 
Really? Now, what 
do you suppose they want? 
Well, they want my eggs... 
 Uhhuh. 
...to start their own 
alien race. 
Whoa, thanks for calling. Hello. You're on the air. 
er.. yea.. I saw four aliens in a car. 
err.. I think it was a Rambler. 
 Whoa, stylish. 
Everyone fully formed? 
 uhhuh. 
Everyone got 10 fingers and 11 toes? 
Yeah Good. I guess we're in. 
Everyone comfortable? 
Ermm.. I have three holes 
in my face. 
Can anyone get your head to swivel to the rear? 
"no" Then how are you supposed to lick your back? 
Maybe you do what they're doing? 
Look. Life-forms, and 
they're cleaning each other. 
Look at us. 
I can't believe we look like them. 
ah ha ha ha... ha ha ha ha ha ha 
he he he heee eeeee Is anybody else sweating under their breasts? 
No... In fact, 
I don't have any. 
I have tiny ones. 
Quick, look. 
That woman is going to drive with her feet. 
Don't you people have a home? 
aah, no, we don't, but thank you for the idea. 
See? She called 
us people. 
Listen. 
It's that signal they keep sending into space. 
Our home for this mission is Earth, a third-rate planet. 
I got a teaching job at a third-rate university. 
Now we're looking at a third-floor apartment. 
Yeah.. Come on in. 
It's the attic, so it's kind of small, but it's furnished. 
We love it. 
 Yeah, it's so much bigger than a car. 
Yeah. 
We'll take it. 
You know... this used to be the rumpus 
room back in the '60s. 
This carpet has seen more butts than Santa Claus's lap. 
Ooh! What is 
this stuff? 
This sweater? 
It's angora. 
Well, it's wonderful. I've 
never seen anything like it... oooohh 
I like the color. 
Well, it's very nice. 
You're not from around here, are you? 
Well, Mrs. Dubcek, I can stand 
here and chew your fat day all day,... 
...but time has no manners. 
Bye, now. 
Sally, I want you to observe her. 
Find out what women on this planet do. 
Well.. why can't Harry do it? 
 Because you're the woman. 
That brings up a very good question: why am I the woman? 
Because you lost. 
Dick? 
I can't see through my eyelids. 
Open them! 
Ooooh... they're manual. 
Oh, good. 
You're here. 
Did you copy the mainframe in the library? 
ahmm.. I got a little 
distracted. 
Again? What happened?Well.. I was 
watching these women play volleyball, ...and they were all jumping up and down,.. 
...up... and down.. in these little shorts. 
And some can't jump as high as the others, but it's okay. 
It's more than okay. 
It's really okay. I mean 
what is wrong with you? 
 I don't know. 
We can't leave without that information. 
.. so access the mainframe, 
enter the net, download, and then go straight home as soon as you're finished. 
Why are you talking to me like I'm a child? 
 You are a child. 
I'm older than you. 
 Well, now I'm bigger, and on this planet size matters. 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
 Ah, Nina. 
Here's your mail. This is nothing. Nothing. 
This is something, but there's nothing you can do about it. 
This is an invitation to a party at the Dean's house. This is nothing. 
And if you don't stop staring at whatever it is you're watching, you're gonna lose something. 
Tommy's just on his way to the library. Aren't you, Tommy? 
Uh, yeah, I am now. 
I have to go look up the word "throb. " 
He's older than he looks. 
Well... I have to file 
some things for you. 
What is that? 
It's you! 
You smell so nice. 
Thanks I try. 
That had better be your nose. 
Is your wife out of town? 
err.. Mrs. Solomon is 
no longer with us. 
She, uh... burned up 
on re-entry. 
I had a boyfriend who used to burn up on re-entry. 
He walks with a limp now. 
Good morning, Dr. Albright. 
Good morning Nina. 
Good morning, Dr. Albright. 
 Nina, would you tell Dr. Solomon 
He parked in my space again. 
You parked in her space  I know. It was empty. 
Would you tell him I'm going to have him towed? 
Tell her I already have all the toes I need. I am fully formed. 
That's my parking space. 
I had to park a mile away. 
Oh, so you have a car. 
Ah!.. Nina, go to the chem lab. 
Tell them I sent you. 
Get a pipe bomb, put it in Dr. 
Solomon's car and blow it up. 
For future reference, I have a red Volvo. 
Please, Dr. Albright! 
We barely know each other. 
Dr. Solomon, 
we should get along. 
I'm very intelligent. You 
have an impressive r�sum�. 
I am the high commander. 
I must admit, when I first met you I was attracted to your flamboyant nature and big head. 
Thanks, because I almost went with a smaller one. 
Even though I am drawn to genius, this is a small office and you are behaving like a big hose monkey. 
You're not so bad yourself, woman. 
Knock it off. 
What is my thesis doing out of my desk? 
Ooh.. I took it out. 
 My desk was locked. 
Which made it very difficult to open. 
You might want to make a note of that. 
You read it? 
 Read it?, I memorized it. 
Well, it's just a few thoughts. 
A few brilliant thoughts. 
 Really? 
That's quite a compliment coming from someone with your credentials. 
I'm glad you enjoyed it. 
 Enjoyed it? 
It's the funniest thing I've ever read. 
Your theory on "man and the animal within," .. it's hilarious! 
Nina said you had no sense of humor. 
She is so wrong. 
The conclusions that you draw are laugh-out-loud funny. 
I see. 
Dr. Solomon, you 
have crossed a line. 
You have belittled my work, and you hurt my feelings. 
I don't like you. 
I don't understand. 
 Of course you don't. You're a man. 
Ha!... That's where you're wrong! 
Okay, so meatloaf is bread crumbs,  spices and ground beef? 
 That's it. 
and ground beef is essentially nothing more than a cow?- Yeah. 
Well, doesn't it scream when they stuff it in the grinder? 
Oh, no. That sucker's 
been dead for hours. 
I have dead cow on my hands? 
AAAAaaaaahhhhhh! 
Women? 
You can't live with them, and yet, they're everywhere. 
So "p" itself is always even. 
And we can write "p" equals 2s, where "s" is some other integer. 
Substituting "p," we find "p" to the second power equals 2s to the second power, equals 4s to the second power, equals 2 Q to the second power, And we find? Who can tell me? Anyone? 
Okay, I'm getting ahead of everyone. 
Let's simplify. How far away is Cleveland? 
 52 miles. 
Someone give me another answer. 
 An hour away. 
Cleveland is an hour away. 
Someone give me another answer. 
A $9 bus ticket. 
 Cleveland is $9 away. 
Oh! a felony charge. The 
federal courthouse is there. 
Yes! Cleveland is 
a felonious assault away. 
Someone else. 
Yes, Leon. 
Well, come on, Leon. 
Speak up. 
No, never mind. I had 
this idea, but it's wrong. 
oh Leon, of course it's wrong. 
I mean, the odds against your being right are... 
staggering! 
You have a great advantage. 
You know the outcome. 
You will be wrong. 
Don't fear it. 
Embrace your wrongness. 
Leon, how far away is Cleveland? 
Cleveland is an eternity away if your heart is there. 
Leon, that is so provocative. 
Where Cleveland equals "p" and eternity equals "q," transposing the logarithm of the heart, where the heart is an unknown, we find that we are forever in Cleveland. 
No, I'm sorry, Leon. 
You're wrong. 
Yes, Caryn. 
Dr Solomon I think that Leon meant that Cleveland can "feel" like an eternity away. 
Oh, it's a "feeling". 
Yes, I know all about "feelings". 
Everything's just going fine, and somebody has a "feeling", and "kaboom"! 
Suddenly they don't like you. 
I think we can all do without feelings. Who's with me? 
Your grade depends on it. 
Dr Solomon? 
I hope this doesn't affect my grade, but I have a thought. 
Yes? 
 You have to have feelings. 
Feelings are like the core of the human experience. 
The core of the human experience? 
Of course. I never 
thought of that. 
ohh.. er.. tomorrow, I want you all 
to write a paper for me about "feelings". 
Tell me how it "feels" to use only 10% of your brain. 
Ooooh, everyone was awake. 
Nina, where is Dr. Albright? 
I have to talk to her. 
She's gone for the day, but she'll be at the Dean's faculty party tonight. 
Right, Dean Sumner's party. 
Tell him I'll be there. 
Ooo, I'll drop everything and do that right now. 
I'm not sure how to get there. 
 I can pick you up. 
That won't hurt your back? 
I'll be in a car. 
Oh good. Come by 
and blow the horn. 
I love to hear people honk. 
What, are you from mars? 
Mars? 
Oh no. 
A hahahaha Hi! 
Hi You're on the volleyball team, aren't you? 
 Yeah, I am. 
I watched you jump up and down this afternoon. 
You're really good. 
 Thanks. We won. 
arrr... it's a game. 
Um, anyway, my name's can I talk to you? 
 Come on, man. 
May I remind you that we are not to alter the lives of the inhabitants of this planet in any way? 
Yeah, but some of them are just asking for it. 
Pull it together. I'm extending 
our mission for one more night. 
Why? 
I have faculty obligations. 
Don't do this to me. I 
never sleep. I'm exhausted. 
Besides, you don't have the authority to alter the schedule. 
Of course I do I'm in command. 
 Yeah? Well, I'm in puberty, pal. 
I don't care what you say. 
It can't be that bad. 
I could pop at any minute. 
Aren't you exaggerating just a little? 
Give me your mind for just a second. 
 oh Please. 
Come on. 
Just give me your mind. 
Oh! That's disgusting! 
 I know. 
You think like that? 
 All the time. 
We've gotta get you out of here. 
Dick, what are you doing? 
 I'm unpacking. 
I've changed my mind. We're 
going to stay a little longer. 
I'm a dead man. 
O.. whoa wo wo wo that's mine! 
Be careful. 
It's, uh... 
.. very valuable. 
You know, I have an urge to hold that. 
That's exactly what it's for. 
 May I? 
Please I find this very satisfying. 
 I know. 
I like this. 
 I know. 
I wonder what Dr. Albright 
is doing right now. 
come on... let's break it up here. 
ohh.. I will be so glad 
to get out of this body. 
What are you doing? 
 I'm unpacking. 
The commander wants to stay a little while longer. What for? 
Because we can't leave yet. 
Did you know that our bodies can produce feelings? 
I got a whole lot of them from Dr. Albright this afternoon. 
Really? 
 Yes. And I'm going to a party 
to see if I can get a little tonight. 
oh, Dick, no. 
I'm telling you, it's a crime against science... 
.. not to experiment 
with ourselves. 
Well wh... Couldn't we just conduct 
these experiments in the privacy of our own home? 
I mean... what can she do that I can't? 
 Lieutenant. 
What? 
 permission to speak freely? 
Permission granted. 
 Sir, would you jump up and down for us? 
Oh, yeah, and put your hands back behind your head like this. 
I will not. 
 Please, for science, truly. 
No. It's not that 
I don't want to help. 
It's just that I don't know how comfortable we would feel working together after an experiment like that. 
It'll be fine. 
 Go ahead. Do it. 
In your dreams! 
 Every night. 
Absolutely not. 
 Okay, fine. 
You leave me no other choice. Now 
we have to experiment at a party. 
Dick, Listen to me. Women are 
trouble. I should know. 
I've been one for two weeks. 
 I know. 
Which brings up another point. 
I command you to shave under your arms. 
Doable. 
I'm sorry you find me so offensive. 
Damn it, pull yourself together, man! 
We're going out. 
 Okay. 
Okay. Give me an hour. 
 An hour? 
Yeah. I gotta 
rotate these. 
It's a party. 
Dr. Solomon, 
how nice to see you. 
Good evening, Mrs. Sumner. 
 Won't you come in? 
If you'll back up. 
Please forgive Sally. 
She's not from Ohio. 
Ooh, I love where you've put these walls. 
err May I take your coat? 
If I can keep my pants. 
Harry, listen, I want you to keep an eye on this Albright experiment. 
Yeah, sure. 
What are these? 
Crustaceans. I mean, Dick is 
endangering this entire mission. 
Mm-hmm, alright. And these? 
 err.. Unborn fowl. 
I'm beginning to question his ability to command. 
Yeah, too bad. 
And these are? 
Cocktail weenies. 
 Cocktail weenies. 
So okay... I've seen these before. 
They should be bigger. 
Nina, right? 
Oh, hi, Sally. 
Nice dress. 
Mm thanks... It's just something I threw on. 
Yeah, boy, you almost missed. 
Uh, hello. Here I am. 
 Yes, there you are. 
Dr. Albright, I've been thinking 
about us all day. I haven't. 
I want to try again. 
I.. want very much to feel, 
and I want even more,to be felt, and I mean that from the heart of my bottom. 
Well, yours up. 
No, I wouldn't do that. 
I mean I.. I'm new at this. 
You see, I've been getting a feeling, and I'm trying to identify it. 
Rub it. 
Maybe it'll go away. 
I just want to make it feel better. 
Well, you could start by saying "I'm sorry. " 
Okay, I'm sorry. 
 You could say it as if you meant it. 
Oh, of course. 
Dr. Albright, 
I'm very sorry. 
Thank you. 
oh.. that felt great. 
eh er.. let's do it again. 
Dr. Albright, 
I'm very sorry. 
Ohh! 
Ooh! Ohhhh! 
Get away from me! 
 What did I not do right? 
Go away! 
 I don't understand! 
Hey!, what do you think? They 
seem to have greater power when they collide. 
I'm not wrong, am I? 
Sally, will you excuse us for a moment? 
Come on, girls. let's go. 
What do you want? 
Dr Albright, I have a scientific proposition. 
I have hidden a hundred dollar bill somewhere on my body... 
.. find it and it's yours. 
You're unbelievable. 
I'll give you a hint. 
It's not in a pocket. 
Aren't you even going to try? 
You're coming on to me. 
 I have no idea what that means. 
It's all right. 
It's in my thesis. 
It's a basic animal attraction. 
We all have the animal within. 
Some are one swing closer to the tree. 
I've see you preen and strut around the office. 
I admit... 
I like it. 
Are you planning to do something important with your mouth tonight? 
Because you've painted it bright red. 
This always happens. 
Dr. Erdman had 
a thing for me. 
Dr. Wallach, Dr. Zucker, 
Dr. Thomas, 
oh.. the guy from Cornell who was 
here for a week. oh, that was insane. 
E- excuse me. 
I have a sudden urge to clean you. 
Oh! 
Ooh! 
Ahhh! 
Oh, Dr. Albright. 
I was just thinking of you. 
Thanks for the weenies. 
oh.. good night, Dr. Solomon. 
Thank you so much for coming. 
Good night. 
what a terrific evening. 
I just had a great time. 
Didn't you? 
Whatever. 
I think this is the most incredible place we've ever been. 
The people are so... complex. 
I love them. I just think they're wonderful. 
You probed her, didn't you? 
I might have scanned for a little. 
I think we've underestimated the life on this planet. 
The people have so much courage. 
Here they are, hurling through space on a molten rock at 67,000 miles an hour, and the only thing that keeps them from flying out of their shoes is... 
their misplaced faith in gravity. 
I'm so glad we're staying. 
I want to find out what else they know, what makes them happy, how they raise their young, what happens when they die, why they call themselves the human race. 
Do they think someone's going to win? 
Ooh, look, a shooting star. 
I think this is going to be our greatest mission. 
Yeah, he probed her, all right. 
Hello! 
 Hi, Dick. 
I brought home a pizza. 
Hey, Dick, how was your day? 
 Sally, what are you doing here? 
I thought you were supposed to be out investigating your chemical attraction to Mr. Randell. 
We had a date, but he had to cancel. 
His mother came in town. 
So? 
I don't know, he said he wanted to break me to her gently. 
So Dick, aren't you going to ask me how my day went? 
Good work, Harry. 
Well-Done. 
Sally, just because you haven't been invited somewhere is no reason not to go. 
Your next assignment is to meet this mother and study her maternal power. 
I could seduce her if you like. 
Uh, no, Harry. 
Tommy, have you infiltrated the glee club yet? 
Yeah, they're very happy. 
End of report. 
 Good work, Tommy. 
Hey, what about me? 
 Well, what about you? 
That's my point. 
You're the high commander, and she's in charge of security. 
He's the information officer. 
What am I? 
 Well, you're... 
you're Harry. 
Oh, sure, I got the fancy title, but what do I do? What am I good at? 
 Uhhh... 
you.. you paint. 
 Oh, yeah, I like painting. 
Painting, yes. 
great, go, paint. 
Oh, okay, off to my painting. 
Just yell if you need me. 
 Sure, whatever. 
Oh, Dick, they've screwed it up again! 
Oh, man! 
 Oh, damn! 
What's this, Tommy? 
 "Star wars." It's a movie. 
What's all that supposed to be? 
Outer space. 
Can you believe it? 
If outer space was that happen, I never would have left. 
Hey Tommy, I'm almost ready. 
 Whoa! Where are you going? 
I'm taking Tommy to school. 
 Oh. 
Well, be sure to talk to that Mr. Randell. 
Oh, will he be there? 
Gosh, I hope I don't distract him. 
Ow! Ow, ow, ow. 
You are in big trouble, and big, big trouble. 
What's going on? 
He was painting something awful on the side of the house. 
A post-impressionist urban mural. 
I was given full permission. 
Tell her, Dick. 
Well, I promise you, Mrs. 
Dubcek, Harry will not go unpunished. 
He will sit in his room and think about what he did while you repaint your house. 
Idle hands do the devil's work. When I was a young girl.. 
the glacier receded, creating the great lakes. 
I'm sure it was incredible. 
Bye-bye, now. 
Good-bye. Bye-bye, now. Good-bye. 
Well, thanks a lot, Dick. 
You tell me to paint, and then you hang me out to dry like a shirt, a wet shirt. 
A wet shirt that needs drying. 
Why is Harry so upset all of a sudden? Is he mad at me? 
No. He just 
feels left out. 
He's searching for his identity, so he's acting up to get your attention. 
How do you know all this? 
 I see it with sophomores all the time. 
What he needs now is an authority figure. 
He's got an authority figure. 
I'm the high commander. 
No, I mean a parent. 
 Yes. 
Mr. Randell has a mother, 
and he turned out dreamy. 
Of course... 
Harry needs a father. 
I should have seen it. 
Well, I can fill those shoes. 
I'm pretending to be your father. 
Of course, I may have to neglect you for awhile. 
I know. I don't mind. 
You're a terrible father, anyway. 
Well, you're a lousy son. 
I'm old and set in my ways. 
It's going to be different with my second son. 
I'm going to be a terrific father to Harry. 
 Oh, sure. 
And I'm going to start off by being completely honest with him. 
What do you mean, honest? 
 I'm going to tell him about that "thing" that they put in his head. 
Oh, no, no. 
 You can't tell him about the thing. 
Telling him about the thing would be a bad thing. 
Shh! Ix-nay 
on the thing-thay. 
Uh, Harry, I've made a decision. 
From now on, I don't want you to think of me as your commander. 
I want you to think of me as a father, a father who outranks you. 
Well, a father? Why? 
 Guidance, emotional support. 
I'll be there for you. 
I'll be the wind beneath your sheets. 
Harry, you need anything at all, you come to me. 
Well, okay. 
Can I borrow the car? 
No. 
 Can I have some cash? 
No. 
 Can I bring a woman to my room? 
Never happen. 
 Sure. 
Oh, well, thanks, commander. 
I mean, Dick.. dad. 
Father Dick. 
Oh. 
Hostilities didn't begin to escalate until the confederate troops attacked fort Sumter. 
And four years later, the war is pretty much over. 
 Mr. Randell. 
 Sally. 
Hey, Solomon. 
 What? 
Are Randell and your aunt like, uh, you know? 
You know? 
 You know? 
I don't know, why don't you raise your hand and ask, you mook? 
So, did you want to talk to me about Tommy? 
No. Tommy's doing fine. 
 Oh. 
Well, then, since I'm here, can I meet your mother? 
I don't know that you're ready to meet my mother. 
We could have dinner, the three of us. 
You don't think it's a little early? 
 No, no. 
I think breakfast would be early. Dinner's fine. 
I don't know, Sally. 
She's not an easy person to get to know. 
She's extremely protective, and she never thinks anyone or any thing is good enough for me. 
I think she's really going to like me... 
a lot. 
Hey, bye, Tommy. 
...Which can be 
directly applied to newton's second law of motion which, for personal reasons, is my favourite. 
Isaac newton, of course, has been called the father of modern physics, which brings me to another question. 
How many of you have fathers? 
Show of hands. Anyone? Fathers? 
Everyone has fathers. Good. 
So, who would like to relate some fatheresque experiences, something very fathely? 
Uh, okay, well, my father and I have this very special.. 
no, no, no, Caryn. Please. 
I'm only interested in father-son experiences. 
Bug? tell me about your father. 
 My father? Very strict. 
It didn't matter that I was the youngest. 
When I'd act up, he'd give me his belt. 
 You wore the same size? 
As punishment, he'd put me over his knee and give me a whooping. 
So he gave you a whooping and a belt? 
Uh, with a belt. 
And then he gave you the belt? 
Um.....yeah. 
Leon, did your dad ever give you a belt? 
No. No, 
my dad's great. 
We have this tradition, every August, we rent a cabin on lake Erie. 
We pick up a case of tall boys, get faced, and hit on the girls who rent the pontoon boats. 
He's really good at it. 
Tomorrow there will be a pop quiz on the effects of thermal dynamics Remember, it's a pop quiz. 
If you study, I'll know. 
Harry! 
Son, look what I brought home for us. 
It's a six-pack of tall boys. 
Let's say we get faced and then I'll give you my belt. 
Forget it, man. 
 What's this? 
I'm cutting out. 
I'm blowing this joint. 
I'm taking some powder. 
You're leaving? You can't leave. 
 Face it, Dick. 
I have no purpose here. 
I'll find you a purpose. 
I'll set up a meeting for you with the campus job counselor. 
That's your world, man, not mine. 
See, I'm rejecting all that "9-to-5, make a living, become a success, feel good about yourself crap. 
That's a sucker's game, man. 
Well, colour me gone. 
But, Harry.. wait. 
You're part of the unit. 
We need you. 
 What do you need me for? 
Well, uh... because... 
we love you, and you're important to the family, and, uh... 
you're so pretty. 
Well, I may be pretty, but I know I'm not important. 
Well no, Harry..you are important. 
I wasn't going to say this. 
Harry, you've got a thing in your head. 
A thing? 
A cranial micro receiver chip. 
In my head? 
 Yes, but it's not in the part you use. It's in your brain. 
This is so exciting. 
I think it's every little girl's dream to meet her boyfriend's mother. 
I always thought it was to get married. 
Mr. Randell, it's 
only been two dates. 
When? 
Hi, honey. 
 Mother. 
Mmm! 
Well, this is Sally. 
Mrs. Randell, it is such 
a pleasure to meet you. 
You sure squeezed out a winner, lady. 
Why, thank you. 
 Why don't we sit down? 
Now, which Sally are you? 
The only Sally. 
 I have to apologize. 
It's just that he's so darn handsome. 
He attracts so many women, I tend to get you all confused. 
Actually, mother, I was the one who was attracted to Sally. 
She has a beautiful smile. 
Oh, absolutely. 
Are those caps? 
Oh, no, they're teeth, they go all the way back. See? 
Isn't she sweet? 
Hm hmm. 
So I have a receiver chip in my brain? 
And I have this, why? 
Well, because sometimes our supreme leader, the big giant head, well, he needs to communicate with us, and we picked you.. 
you, Harry. 
Without you, we can't maintain contact with the home office. 
There now, don't you see how important you are? 
Oh well... does Tommy know about this? 
 Yes. 
Does Sally know about this? 
 Yes. 
Do you know about this? 
Yes. 
Look, I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner, but.. 
isn't it neat to find out new things about yourself? 
You have destroyed my life! 
Harry, please. 
 Ohhh, so it's okay for me to have a thing in my head, but it's not okay for me to know about it? 
And you call yourself a father. 
I'm out of here. 
No, Harry, you are not leaving! 
You're coming right back here! That's an order. 
You know, Dick, if you were my father, I would think that you would care enough about my feelings to just let me go. 
You're right. You need to 
sort this out for yourself.. 
Go. 
But as high commander, I must have access to that transmitter. 
Stay! 
But I want you to have your own space. 
Go. 
But I can't allow this breach of protocol. 
I order you to stay! 
Leave the nest. 
Fly. 
I need your head. 
You come back here! 
I'm sorry. Go. 
No, stay! 
No, go! 
Stay! Go! 
Stop! 
You're tearing me apart! 
Give me a beer. 
 What kind? 
The kind you drink. 
Hi, I'm margueritte. 
Who are you? 
I don't know who I am. 
All I know is I got something inside my head, something that could go off at any minute, some sort of answering machine with some cosmic message sent from somewhere out there in the universe. 
I'm an Aquarius. 
Hey, who are you talking to? 
I don't know, some guy. 
 Was he hitting on you? 
Why? You jealous? 
Hey, you talkin' to my girl? 
You don't look old enough to be her father. 
What are you, a comedian? 
No, that would be buddy Hackett. 
You got wheels? 
 On my car. 
Okay, you and me, pal. 
Dead man's curve. We're 
gonna play a game of chicken. 
I'll stop at the colonel's! 
I wonder how he's doing out there all by himself. 
You know, if you're a bad father, they leave. 
If you're a good father, they leave. 
A parent's love is like a river. 
No matter how deep or strong its current, it's always flowing towards a sea of separation. 
Lighten up, Dick. You're going to 
give yourself a hallmark hernia. 
Hello. Yes? 
The police? 
You've got Harry? 
He crashed the car... 
at dead man's curve? 
We'll be right over. 
Tommy, something terrible has happened. 
Harry crashed the car at dead man's curve. 
Why is the father always the last to know? 
Okay, so we've left the dance, and we're parked in your son's car... 
 Sally and he can't seem to undo the top hook. 
Sally, please don't. 
Oh come on. 
it's a cute story. 
Let her talk. 
 I ordered the salmon. What did you order? 
My, that's an interesting dress you're wearing. 
 You like my dress? 
Good, 'cause I didn't know if you'd be impressed by how confident I am to wear a dress like this. 
Or maybe I should have gone with something a little more conservative, as if to say "what's underneath here is not for anybody but your son". 
Well, I think that dress says it's not just for my son, it's for the whole room. 
Good. That's a relief. 
If you want to control my life, you could be more subtle about it. 
I don't want to intrude, so if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the ladies' room. 
I think she's upset with you. I'm going to talk to her. 
Sally, I don't think it's  Shh! I'm doing it for you. 
Frances, are you all right? 
Me? I'm fine, honey. 
It's you I'm worried about. 
Me? 
Well, I'm afraid you're just not my son's type. 
What do you mean? 
 Now, don't get me wrong. 
You're really not half as cheap as you look. 
I get it. 
You're insulting me, aren't you? 
I have made such a huge mistake. 
I thought you were nice, but you're not nice. 
You hate me. 
I am so glad we finally understand each other. 
Me, too, Frances, 'cause as long as I'm going to date your son, I don't want any problems. 
Over my dead body. 
Doable. 
If you're going to throw a punch, try putting your weight into it, like this. 
Ow! 
Will the ladies be returning? 
One of them will. 
I'm Dr. Solomon. 
Where's my son, my son Harry? 
Well the good news is he's alive. 
Oh, thank god! 
But I have to warn you, he don't look so good. 
That's what he always looks like. 
Harry! 
 Oh, Dick. 
Harry, I've failed you. 
If I'd been there for you when you needed me, then you wouldn't have run out of the house. You could have died. 
Dick, I almost did die. 
What happened? 
It was the most amazing journey. 
 What do you mean? 
I was leaving the colonel after picking up chicken  Wait. Why a chicken? 
Long story short, I have no idea. 
So, I was on my way to the big race, and a paper bag blew across the road. 
I was afraid it was full of bunnies, so I swerved. 
And right as the car was flying into the ditch, my whole life flashed before my eyes. 
Harry, I don't mean to be insensitive, but what's your point? 
Well, all I could think was, "I have a rage to live". 
And then the car landed, and I said, "hey, world, I'm alive! 
And these pants are washable." 
That's a beautiful story. 
 Thank you. 
Oh, Dick, it doesn't matter that I'm an underling with a thing in my head. 
What matters most is life itself. 
And the greatest thing about life is not having a purpose. 
It's finding... 
a purpose. 
Why, Harry, you sound exactly like me. 
Like fake father, like fake son. 
Dick, could we just drop the father thing and go back to being fake brothers? 
You don't want me to be your dad anymore? 
 No. 
Good, because I was this close to drop-kicking your sorry butt from here to the outlet mall! 
I'm sorry you had to pay the damages at the restaurant. 
No, it was worth the 1700 dollars. 
Wait till my brother's wife hears about this. 
Once at Christmas, she took a clumsy swing, but mom got her in a headlock and she blacked out. 
You were great. 
 I really liked her. 
I don't think she liked you. 
 I didn't like her, either. 
I really like you, though. 
Same here. 
Ow! 
Your mother wears a lot of rings. 
No... 
pain can be good. 
You know, someday I'd like to be a real father with a real son.. 
a little guy who'd be sweet and cuddly, pink and puffy, just like his old man. 
You do realize that your son could wind up being a daughter? 
Oh, no, no, not my son. 
I bet Mr. Randell 
would make a great father. 
I can see him now, sitting with his kids, helping them with their homework, telling them what a cow pie their grandmother is. 
A lovley image. 
Yeah, all this romance talk makes me want to call my girlfriend. 
Hey, Harry, can you give me a dial tone? 
Well, aren't we witty. 
Let me ask you this. Has the 
big giant head ever called us? 
Not yet. 
 How will we know when he does? 
Well, when the big giant head calls. 
Harry will suddenly go blank and stare off into space. 
Like I said, how will we know when he does? 
Look at this "Garfield." 
I don't care what language you speak, that cat's funny. 
What have you got there, Harry? 
Yesterday I was exploring the park, and I found this stone. 
Look at it. 
It's been worn to a perfect sphere by the elements and dimpled by time. 
Harry, that's a golf ball. 
You've got way too much free time on your hands. 
Well, you know, Dick, I've tried a lot of different things since we got to earth, and I've made a discovery.. 
I'm not good at anything. 
There's got to be something that you can do. 
Here, let me look through the want ads. 
What's that smell? 
 I'm making blueberry muffins. 
Smells like they're done. 
 No, the timer didn't go off. 
Yes, but lieutenant.. 
 I have incinerated entire armies. 
I think I can handle an oven. 
I'm glad to hear you say that 'cause I signed you up for a bake sale. 
 What's a bake sale? 
It's just an attempt to revive a failing educational system through parental involvement. 
A fine cause. 
I'm there. 
I really think you should check on those muffins. 
The box said 15 minutes. 
You don't argue with the box. 
Here's something that you could do. 
They want somebody to sweep up the burger palace. 
Oh, sure, after about four years of grad school maybe. 
Now they're done. 
Ooh! Look at this. 
Here's a job I can do. 
"Police seek third gunman". 
Tomorrow I'm going to march right down to the police station and tell them I'm the man they're looking for. 
 Good for you. 
They're ready, but they're just going to be a little burnt. 
This is the bake sale committee, right? 
 Yes. 
I don't believe I've seen you before. 
 I don't believe you're blond. 
Okay, everybody, let's take our seats and get started. 
As you know, this is my sixth year as chairman of the bake sale. 
And, um... 
I think we've done pretty darn well. 
Last year, we raised $500. 
How much did you make before that? 
Well, I don't want to brag, but we've made roughly $500 each of the last six years. 
Uh-huh. So what 
you're saying is, the group is stagnating under your leadership. 
You're new around here. 
Let's start the meeting, shall we? 
Any thoughts on this year's sale? 
Yeah, I have a thought. 
This group isn't advancing. 
It's retreating. 
You dropped the ball, sister. 
I am a master chef. 
I trained at the culinary institute of Pittsburgh. 
I think I know a little bit about baking. 
Okay, well, here's what I know about baking: zip. 
These troops need a leader, not some chirpy, weak chinned, underachieving drone. 
No offence. 
Look, if you aim for 500 bucks, you get 500 bucks. 
But there's a saying where I come from... 
"when you want to punch someone in the nose, you aim for the back of the head." 
That is, if they have a head. 
So aim for 10 grand and don't settle for anything less than five. 
Um, grace... 
I think she should be in charge. 
Ah! Good morning, Nina. 
 Good morning. 
Nina, my brother Harry is trying to find something to keep himself busy. 
I was just wondering, how did you get this job? 
I found a magic lamp on the beach, and this was my first wish. 
Wonderful. 
How can Harry get hold of a magic lamp? 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
 Ah, Dr. Albright. 
There's something different about you this morning. 
I have a new blouse. 
 No, that's not it. 
And I hope you didn't pay too much for it. 
That's it! It's the box. What's in it? 
Oh, this? 
Painting supplies. 
I'm taking a painting class. 
I'm not very good at it. 
So, you're bad. 
I wouldn't say I was bad. 
You have to understand I have incredibly high standards and I tend to be very critical of myself. 
But, as an amateur, I've demonstrated quite a bit of potential. 
So, you're bad. 
Yeah, but art is essentially subjective. 
There is no good or bad. 
So if you stink, you're still allowed to do it? 
 Well... 
that sounds perfect. 
 Are you interested? 
Me? Don't be 
ridiculous. 
I was talking about Harry. 
 Oh. 
Oh, you thought I was worried about being less than perfect? 
That's rich. 
Here's how it's going to work. 
Doors open, crowd come in. First 
thing they see: finger pastries. 
They nosh a little, they're delighted. 
They continue on to the layer cakes. 
The smell hits 'em, they're drooling like rabid dog Then the heavy artillery. 
They reach the walnut bread, the almond bars, the cashew squares. 
Bang! We got 'em 
by the roasted nuts. 
Carry on, lieutenant. 
 Thank you, sir. 
Sally, that was Andy Larson on the phone. 
Did you really make his mom do one-Handed push-ups till she cried? 
Yes. She had to be broken 
for the sake of the unit. 
You know, this art is fascinating. 
Every era, every culture, they all have their own art. 
What drives them to create this? 
 Naked women. 
These are not naked women. 
They're nudes. 
Nudity is the artist's passionate celebration of the human form. 
Well, party on. 
Dick, why is it that you see nude people in museums, but they never show 'em on Tv? 
 Sure, they do, but never in comedies, only in dramas, and, even then, only when the ratings sag. 
Harry. 
Harry, what's wrong? 
I got fired from my job at the kids' pizza place. 
Oh, no. 
 Yes. They dressed me up like a giant mouse, 
so I figure I'll just get into character, and then they complain when I eat off the floor. 
Don't you worry about that. I 
found something else for you to do. 
You're coming with me to an art class. 
Art? I wasn't creative 
enough to be a rodent. 
No, no, you don't have to be creative to do art. 
You just have to be a certain type. You've been ostracized, 
spit upon, and strangers repeatedly tell you that you're crazy. 
You've got everything it takes. 
"The last supper" by Leonardo Da Vinci. 
Boy, the guy in the middle really knows how to throw a party, huh? 
And he's sitting in front of the archway. 
So what? 
 The negative space in the archway draws our focus. 
And the hills outside the archway fade into a bluish haze, creating distance. 
So it's sort of like it's not just a party, it's a going-away party. 
Harry, I'm impressed. 
 Mmm, me, too. 
Can we buy it? 
Don't be silly. After one 
week, we'd be sick of it. 
Oh, Dick, this is wonderful. 
Do you have any idea how good it feels to do something for the first time and not suck at it? 
Well, hello. It's nice to 
see a couple of fresh faces. 
Well we're very fresh, Squeeze my head, it's soft. 
Oh, Harry, that's really interesting. 
I remember that. 
 Yeah. 
That was that thing that burst out of that guy's thorax. 
And we hit it and hit it and hit it... 
and it just wouldn't die. 
It's... a family joke. 
Sorry. 
All right, class, let's take a look at what we've been working on for the last two weeks. 
Who would like to be first? 
 Mary. 
I call this painting "spirits of spring." 
When I was growing up in Indiana and all the other kids would exclude me from their playing, I'd sit in my yard and anxiously await the tiny crocuses to pop their happy heads out from their winter sleep. 
Oh! That's 
a beautiful story. 
Oh! 
 It's a lousy painting, but it is a beautiful story. 
It's very nice, Dr. Albright. 
Anyone have any comments? 
 Uh, well, I.. 
oh, never mind. 
It's stupid. 
Well, don't let that stop you, Harry. Go ahead. 
Well, um... 
I just find that my focus is drawn to the upper right corner but when it gets there, there's nothing to see. 
Maybe you could add a splash of yellow to carry out the motif you've already established. 
But what do I know? 
 Actually, that's a very good suggestion. 
Really? 
 Really? 
Yes! Harry, you've really 
opened something up for me. 
I know exactly what you're saying. 
Thank you. 
Wow! Thank you! 
You work with her. 
Is this sarcasm? 
Low-mass black holes form only when matter is compressed into enormous densities by very large external pressures.. 
and this demonstrates which principle of quantum matter physics? 
I'll give you a hint. It has 
nothing to do with geometric cosmology. 
Anyone? 
If no one answers, I'll have to pick someone. 
Someone please answer. 
Please raise your hand. 
Please, someone. 
Answer, please. 
Leon, since you're talking, I'll ask you. 
What's the principle? 
 Wetness? 
No. Try again. 
 Dr. Solomon, why do you keep calling on Leon? 
It's just not funny anymore. 
That's nonsense. 
Leon, the only way of understanding the universe is to find the limits of your own intelligence. 
I think I've reached my limit. 
Bug. 
 Yes, Dr. Solomon? 
You're hiding something. 
 It's just a doodle. 
A doodle? 
Why, this is a picture of me with antlers and something coming out of my buttocks. 
It's a tail. 
Well, it is That's brilliant! 
The lines, the contours, the way you've picked up the essence of my rugged good looks. 
It's just a doodle. 
 Just a doodle? 
And Alan thicke is just an actor. 
Tomorrow I want everyone to bring in three sharpened pencils, and bug will teach us all how to doodle. 
All right. 
Damn! 
I've tasted your butter cookies, Mrs. Stevenson, 
and, yes, I can believe it's not butter. 
Use a butter substitute, and you'll find yourself saying, "I can't believe I was bounced out of this bake sale right onto my ass." 
Get with the program. 
Tommy, do you ever doodle? 
Why? Was I in 
the bathroom too long? 
I.. I can't doodle. 
Well, Dick, you're kind of old. 
Old? Picasso doodled 
on tablecloths late into his 60s. 
That's disgusting. 
 I know. 
I just can't draw. 
Oh, doodling! Oh. 
It's inexplicable. 
I, who bestride this world like an intellectual colossus, I, who make lesser men quiver in awe of my cranial prowess, I, who.. 
I've forgotten my point. 
Dick, I invented a new color. 
I combined red and yellow. 
I call it red-yellow. 
I can't wait to show it in art class. 
 Great! 
Mix up a whole vat of it. 
Go! Hop to it, 
you ironically-gifted chowderhead. 
Why did I say that? What's wrong with me? 
 Could it be.. 
and this is just a wild guess.. that 
Harry is way better at something than you? 
Give me some credit. 
I'm the high commander. 
I don't engage in petty rivalry. 
Look, Dick, you're actually younger than me, right? 
Right. 
 But on this mission you got to be taller. 
Now, don't you think that eats my lunch just a little bit? 
You don't see me whining. 
 How can you be so cool about it? 
'Cause I'm older than you, little buddy. 
Tommy, I got a reconnaissance report from Mrs. Nadle. 
Our only real competition is the kissing booth. 
This year they have hookers. 
Sally, those are cheerleaders. 
 Not if they're charging. 
Banana nut muffin heads. 
Are there two parts banana to every one part walnut? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
I can't hear you. 
 Yes, ma'am! 
Mmm, mighty tasty rugula, Mrs. Greenstein. 
Thank you, ma'am. 
Now, before we open the doors, I just have one more thing to say. 
You are, by far, the saddest, sorriest, most pathetic group of mothers... 
I have ever had the honor of commanding, and I'll never forget you. 
Music. 
Doors. 
All right, ladies, take no prisoners or personal checks. 
Dick, are you mad at me? 
No. 
 Lately you get this weird grin, like you're hiding something. 
It's not about art class, is it? 
Art class? Why, no, 
I don't care about art. 
Let's not forget what one of the great thinkers of the 20th century said.. 
"art is no damn good." 
What great thinker said that? 
 Jesse helms. 
Besides, I've made a command decision. 
We're not going to art class anymore. It's not productive. 
We've experienced it. 
Let's move on. 
All Righty. 
Permission to speak, high commander? 
What did you say? 
 Permission to speak, Dick? 
You've never asked permission to speak before. 
I've never had anything worth saying..but.. 
Dick, this art thing means a lot to me, and I have no idea why. 
All I know is that I like doing it. 
So I want to go tomorrow whether you go or not. 
I'm sorry. 
There's no need to be sorry for something you're good at Harry. 
You go to class. 
 Really? 
Ye-es. 
If that's what makes you happy, then I'm happy. 
Ohh, thanks, Dick. 
Mmm, now there's the smile I like. 
You're soaking wet. 
Am I? 
You've been acting strangely. 
What's wrong? 
It's kind of hard to talk about. 
I have this... friend 
whose brother Harry is a much better artist than he is. 
Oh, so this is about you and Harry. 
Am I that transparent? 
I'm going to tell you a little story. 
My partner in dance class in college was a girl named Nadia. 
She got all the leads, all the attention. 
People would call her lithe, willowy, leggy. 
I rehearsed with her. 
I showed her a tremendous amount of support. 
I went to all the recitals. 
She'd leap and twirl on the stage, exuding this incredible sensual grace, while I sat there, a frozen smile on my face, loathing her for my own inadequacies. 
Well, you have any pictures of her? 
That's not the point. 
The thing I came to realize was that she needed me there. 
My support inspired her to dance. 
That was enough for you? 
 Well, look at the "Mona Lisa." 
She never picked up a paintbrush, and yet she inspired the most famous painting in the world. 
So it's like whistler and his mother. 
 Exactly. 
Van Gogh and his potato eaters. 
 Yes. 
Michelangelo and his, uh... 
ceiling full of naked guys trying to touch fingers. 
More or less. 
 Inspiration. 
Yes. 
 Yes! 
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
That little story really helped me. Thank you! 
Sure. 
Oh, and by the way, I love your stubby little legs. 
Harry, were your parents artistic? 
Not really. My mother was a cold receptacle, 
and my father was just a machine. 
Well, we all have our baggage. 
But don't forget, out of suffering comes creativity. 
You can't spell "painting" without "pain. 
Mmm...or "ting. 
Oh, Dick, you came. 
Are you going to paint? 
 Even better. 
I now accept the fact that I do not have artistic talent, like you, like Harry. 
I know now that I will never be able to be a part of a class like this, but Dr. Albright 
has made me see the joy that I can take in inspiring other people. 
No, I will never be an artist, but I can make a great subject. 
Prepare to meet... 
your muse! 
Oh, great... 
I'm gonna need more pink. 
You're telling me Dr. Solomon 
posed for this? 
Yes. 
 Mmhmm. 
Mmm, well, hello, Dr. Solomon. 
Well, hello, Nina! 
Well, I'll leave you three alone. 
Oh! This is wonderful. 
I really did inspire you, didn't I? 
Yes. - You know, the whole time 
I was standing there, I kept thinking about how you inspired Nadia. 
Whatever happened to her? 
 Alcoholic, trailer park, seven kids. 
No, it really is a shame. 
What do you call it? 
"Middle-aged naked guy who can't paint." 
Leading that bake sale was exhilarating. 
Those women were crying out for leadership. 
You know, over half this planet's population is female. 
If I could just harness their power, we could easily turn men into a slave race. 
Or maybe just talk hair. 
You know, I've discovered that here on earth every human has his own talents and his own flaws. 
The smart ones have learned to use their talents, but the happy ones have learned to accept their flaws. 
I know I've accepted mine. 
Permission to mention your receding hairline, sir? 
Permission denied. 
Well, here's my latest painting. It's a still life. 
That's very interesting. 
 And very dark. 
It's a bunch of rotten fruit. 
Yeah, I really got to learn to paint faster. 
Aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
And...well, they had an extra seat. 
The Earth is covered with a deep hard crust. 
Although it does have a wonderful chewy center. 
Is it cable yet? 
hey, hey, is it cable? 
You're wired. 
Ohhhhh This is the second most exciting thing I've ever held in my hand. 
Harry, you ready to go? 
Oh Dick, we've got cable, 72 channels. 
And unlike primitive free television, this one you get to pay for. 
That's nice. 
Sally, are you finished in the bathroom yet? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
You live in an attic? 
You're poor? 
It's so cool. 
Thanks. 
Hi! 
Who's that? 
This is Cheryl. She's a cheerleader. 
A what? 
Show them a cheer. 
Oh not in front of all these people. 
Come on, come on. 
Okay. 
Ready! Okay! 
R a m s Let's go, rams! 
Whoo! 
So... 
she's proud of her spelling. 
I'll meet you in the kitchen. We can study in there. 
Tommy, what happened to August? 
August?... well, August 
is bright and intelligent and funny, and I love to be with her, but, Cheryl's easy. 
So you're jeopardizing a meaningful relationship, for pure physical pleasure. 
Exactly. 
Very well. Carry on. 
Thank you, sir. 
Sally, here's your coat. 
And I want you to be on your best behavior. 
This is a party in honour of Leonard Hanlin. 
Why? Nobody 
likes him. 
They hate him, but they honour him. 
It's a human phenomenon that I find fascinating. 
Behind his back they deride him, but to his face they kiss his ass. 
Well, that's just the kind of stunt you can see only on cable. 
Plus we got sports, music, movies. 
Oh, and look. 
"El mundo pac�fico" Ah, that's muy bueno. 
No. 
Oh. 
English, Spanish, French... 
I know, I know. 
Earth.. go figure. 
Dr. Hanlin, it is an honour 
to have you here. 
Well, thank you, Dean Sumner. 
And, you, be a pleasant toady and bring me another one of those, would you? 
Dr. Hanlin, we so admire 
your accomplishments. 
Well, I admire your courage, Mrs. Sumner. 
An Audubon print over the mantle passing for art.. 
that takes guts. 
Look who I found. 
It's Dr. Solomon. 
Well, an honest man in a den of bootlickers, not that I don't enjoy having my boots licked. 
It's just that I find you all contemptible. 
So tell me, Dick, what do you think of my work? 
Mechanistic and disturbingly fascist, but pretentious high schoolers might find it thought-provoking. 
I think it's groundbreaking. 
I don't need the opinion of a water boy with tenure. 
I'm talking to my friend. 
I like you, Solomon. 
Well, I don't like you. 
But I don't think anybody hates me more than your friend, doctor, um... 
 Albright. 
Yes. Probably because 
I turned her down. 
I need something from the bar. 
Yes, that should solve all your problems. 
Well, then let's get drinking. 
Excuse me. 
Can I help you? 
Well, somebody said there was a giant flaming jackass over here. 
They put it out. 
I hate that man. 
I wish there was some way he could be.. 
nicer? 
No, dead. 
Well, you're published again. Congratulations. 
Nina, what are you doing here? 
You're a secretary. 
You're Dr. Solomon's 
sister. 
You're a lot better-looking than he is. 
Hey, I'm up here. 
Yes, all women would like to think that. 
How would you like to have your eyeballs in the bottom of a martini glass? 'Cause I can do it. 
Oh, oo-ooh.. The amazon's going 
to manhandle me. 
You're not worth a broken nail. 
Dr. Hanlin? 
Dr. Hanlin! 
Somebody call 9-1-1. 
I think he's dead. 
Dr. Albright, 
you got your wish! 
Okay, so the kinds of triangles are isosceles, equilateral, scalene. 
And what's the other one? 
Why do I have to know this if I'm going to be a teacher? 
You want a soda? 
'Kay. 
Em, there's juice, too, if you'd rather have that, or water. 
Hi. 
August, you're here. 
Yeah, we have a science project, remember? 
em, yeah, right. 
I think I want a soda. 
Oh-hh! Hello, 
Auggie. 
Cheryl. There's 
something different about you. 
Is it your hair? No. 
Oh, you're holding a book. 
Tommy, could you hurry up? 
I'm really thirsty. 
Cheryl's helping me with my math homework. 
She is You know, if you want to hang out with Cheryl, that's okay. 
We haven't made any serious declarations of our feelings, so there isn't the issue of ownership. 
But.. and, 
just like Cheryl, this is a big "but"... 
you could at least be honest with me. 
August, I'm sorry. 
Hello! 
I thought you were bringing me something to drink. 
Oh, right. 
Sorry. Sorry. 
Diet. 
 Sorry. 
I can't believe this. I've 
never seen anybody die before. 
I know, it's amazing. 
One minute, he's active, and the next, he's inert. 
First he's limber, and then he's stiff. 
His eyes are twinkly, then they're milky. 
He's rosy, then sallow. 
Oily, then dry. 
Gurgly, then silent. 
 Will you stop! 
Dick? Dick, 
we have a problem. 
What? 
 I killed him. 
Oh, that's just great. 
Didn't I say best behaviour? 
I never meant to kill him. 
 Why can't you be like Dr. Albright? 
She wanted him dead, but did she act on it? No... 
because she's a lady. 
The police are here. 
We've gotta get outta here. 
We will. Just walk out calmly. 
 Okay, here we go. 
Look casual. 
No. No, no. I think we all know 
why Dr. Hanlin died. 
He had a bad heart. 
He ignored his doctor's advice. He brought it on himself. 
Oh, thank god! 
 Yes! 
Let's eat! 
 All right! 
Promise me something. 
what? 
Promise me that you'll never do what Dr. Hanlin did at the party. 
Feel up the caterer? 
I won't. 
Promise me you'll never collapse and be hauled away under a sheet. 
Because the thought of you lying there, purple, rigid and distended, just makes me so sad. 
'Kay. 
You know what we should do right now? 
Run out of here, grab a couple of horses, ride bareback through the woods all night, and make love in a meadow at sunrise. 
I have a class in five minutes, and that's just the first of my reservations. 
Forget class. 
Let's live! 
Let's taste danger. 
Let's go for the gusto, consequences be damned. 
Let's drive fast and eat cheese. 
Are you insane? 
I've simply awakened to the sensual possibilities of everything around me. 
You know, I think she's fully inflated. 
What is it, Nina? 
This letter just came for you. It's from Dr. Hanlin. 
"Dear Dr. Solomon, 
if you are reading this, it means that I am dead. 
As one honest man to another, it is my dying wish that you deliver an honest eulogy without any embellishment or flattering crap." 
An honest eulogy, I can do that. 
No, you can't. 
An honest eulogy for that man would be insulting. 
Well, I'll just have to find something to say about him that's both honest and uplifting. 
Oh, how about "we love him more today than yesterday"? 
S  P... I R... I T 
Go, spirit, let's hear it! 
Go, spirit, let's hear it! 
S P... I R... I T! 
Go, spirit!  Let's hear it! Go, spirit! Let's hear it! 
 Oh, gosh! 
oh, that is.. 
she's got the spirit. 
Isn't she wonderful? 
Yeah, the magic never ends. 
Mrs. Dubcek, did you hear this? 
 Yes, I heard it. 
I don't know what is going on up here, but I have plaster falling into my jacuzzi. 
I've never heard it called that before. 
Take it outside. 
 Later, Tommy. 
So, Tommy, can't find fulfillment in a meaningless relationship with a superficial, simple minded bimbo? 
I know. I'm just 
as baffled as you are. 
Mrs. Dubcek, 
have you ever been involved in funeral arrangements? 
Well, not for myself.. 
for my second husband. 
Lovely funeral, very nice. 
 Well, I.. 
I've been working on this eulogy. What was his like? 
Well, it was an outdoor service. 
And then this woman came along, asking for directions because she was lost and she couldn't find her way home. 
And we were so touched, that we just forgot about Carl's eulogy and just planted him. 
So I-- I just need to find some babbling eccentric to create a diversion. 
What are you doing on Saturday? 
You're just lucky, you're so damnedably handsome. 
Why does death have to be so inconvenient? 
Mmm, to die, to sleep. 
To sleep, perchance to dream. 
Ohh! 
There's the rub, for in that sleep of death what dreams may come... 
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause. 
What's that from? 
 I don't know, some Mel Gibson movie. 
Mel Gibson, he's dreamy. 
Mmmmmm. 
If we measure "x" in grams and "y" in centimeters per second, then "z" is measured in a unit of energy we call ergs. 
The complete conversion of one gram of mass into energy thus releases one times three times 10 to the 10th power squared, which brings me to another point-- Your lives are fragile, and you're all going to die! 
Your time is short, and... 
I barely know any of you. 
Close your books. 
I want to sit among you. 
I want to share your thoughts, learn your fears, expose your darkest secrets. Who's first? 
Bug, what about you? 
 Uh... 
why are you called bug? 
 I got hit by a Volkswagen. 
And, Leon. 
 What? 
Where are you from? 
 Here. 
You see? 
This is fascinating. 
Uh, who's next? 
Pitman. 
Uh... what about you, Dr. 
Solomon? Where are you from? 
Okay. 
I'm sure that you've all heard of the radio telescope. 
Well... funny story, 
true story. 
I'm not human. 
Well, that's all the time we have. 
Oh, and by the way, I assume that some of you have taken a class from Dr. Hanlin. 
Does anyone have any stories about him? 
I need something nice. 
 oh, sorry. 
I know that it was his final request, that I be forthright and honest, but the problem is, I can't seem to find anything good to say about this man, and I've been looking. 
You know, Dick, everyone has goodness within them. 
If you look beneath the surface far enough, I think you're going to discover a basic inner core of goodness that, well, makes us all children of god. 
Well... 
I guess I'll just have to try to find that in Dr. Hanlin. 
Leonard Hanlin? 
Oh, well, good luck. 
Listen, August, about Cheryl.. 
 No. 
No, look, we used to be involved. That's over. 
I'm okay with that. 
Now let's not let it affect our academic relationship. 
No, I made a mistake with her. 
See, I don't want Cheryl. I want you. 
Of course you want me. 
What can I do to fix this? 
You could take me someplace nice. 
All right, um... okay. 
There's this thing I got to go to tomorrow afternoon 'cause my dad knew this guy. 
It's, um... 
you have to dress up, 'cause it's really, really nice. 
Sure. 
So when they asked me to come to earth, I thought, "why not?" 
I was in a rut, working for the big giant head. 
You know him. 
 Harry! 
Uh, just a minute. 
Who were you talking to? 
 Nobody. 
Dr. Hanlin. 
How did he get here? 
 I gave him a ride. 
This isn't Dr. Hanlin anymore. 
It's an empty vessel. 
See, if he were alive, could I do this? 
Could any man alive resist a fresh banana? 
I rest my case. 
But, Dick, when our mission ends and we leave this planet, will our bodies end up like that? 
Of course. It's happened a million times. 
We study a planet. 
We take on the life-forms. 
We finish the job. We 
discard the life-forms. The end. 
Dick, I feel different here. 
I mean, I like Sally. What 
will happen to her when I'm gone? 
What happens to all her stuff? 
All her shoes? 
You won't care, because the thing that's really you will be in another galaxy. 
And Sally will be... 
just like Dr. Hanlin. 
Whoa, Dick, he's going for the banana. 
Oh, no! 
I need to run this eulogy by you. 
Just say whatever you're going to say. 
No, no, I think I've found a positive angle. 
"Office space is at a premium on this campus, so you'll be happy to hear--"  Stop! 
The man is dead. 
We're ready to start. 
See how nice it is? 
This... 
is the thing for the guy you invited me to? 
Yeah. 
What? 
How... 
can we honour the memory of a man like Leonard Hanlin? 
Well... 
he was governed by the laws of physics, as are all living things. 
It is a scientific fact that hearts and clocks slow down as they approach the speed of light, the point at which matter is converted into energy. 
Dr. Hanlin's heart 
approached that speed on Friday evening... 
at 7:57, according to the coroner, converting his matter into energy, into pure white light. 
Though he is no longer with us, he is all around us. 
Thank You. 
That was absolutely beautiful. 
Matter to energy? 
Could you have been more trite? 
Why didn't you just phone it in? 
The fact that someday we'll lose these bodies makes me want more. 
I want to share myself with someone. 
And I think we all know who. 
I want to savor every moment. 
I want to see places outside of Ohio. 
Hmm, I want one of those big cheeseburgers with three buns. 
I want one of those things, you see people with them. You 
know, they're like this big. 
A baby? 
 Yeah. 
Aren't you kind of stuck with a baby for your whole life? 
No, you only have a baby for, like, two years. 
Men. 
Dick, when are we going to leave these bodies? 
When we've learned everything there is to know about life. 
Whoa. Good thing 
we got cable. 
Sally, where's my breakfast? 
I haven't had anything to eat since that bottle of ketchup you fixed me, Not that it wasn't delicious. 
Yeah, yeah, keep your pants on. 
Now, I just can't get ready as fast as you guys. 
Every morning I have to wash, dry, pluck, powder, dab, cleanse, deep cleanse, exfoliate, pop, curl, blow, and buff. 
Well, that's far too complicated. 
I usually just rinse, spit, unzip the parka, and voil�. 
Sally, where's my breakfast? 
I'm working on it. 
Harry, what are you doing on the floor? 
I have no idea. 
But what is noble in a universe where entropy grips us in a fatal dance of nihilistic despair? 
Why is he talking like this? 
 I don't know. All I did was this. 
Give me this. If he's broken, 
it's going right into the report. 
I wrote me a little song yesterday , and it goes something like this: 'hi-Dee hi hi-Dee ho, hi Dee hiDee, hiDee, ho' what's with Harry? 
 I don't know. 
He seems to be having a reaction to a crushing skull blow. 
What, with this? 
 Yeah. 
Be careful. We could actually hurt Harry. 
Now, liberals want you to believe that more government is gonna solve your problems.. 
hey. 
 I'm sorry. 
I couldn't live with that. 
Hurry, hurry! 
 I'm coming, I'm coming Stop it, already. 
 What took you so long? 
Her pants are tight. 
She can't go too fast. 
What is the big emergency? 
 Look, it's just awful. 
I don't see anything. 
 It's the dishes. 
They're dirty, and we need a plate. 
Don't you boys know how to wash a dish? 
Of course not, that's Sally's job. 
 That and killing spiders. 
Please. 
 we wouldn't ask you, except Sally's mysteriously absent, and without a clean plate we could starve! 
Dick! Dick, 
come in here! 
Here she is. 
You guys are not going to believe all the cute stuff I got today. 
Everything came together like a well-oiled pistol. 
I've got the last pair of size eight ferragamo slingbacks on layaway. 
I need 300 bucks. 
 Why? 
Because without the shoes, the belt is a joke. 
Lieutenant, we seem to be having a breakdown in communication because I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Of course you don't. It's about women. 
 Ah, the women's issue. 
Maybe if you would explain it to me, I would understand. 
I've been explaining it to you since we got here. 
One thing I do understand: this female obsession of yours is costing me a fortune. 
spider! 
All right, fine, high commander. 
Take it all back to the store and get your money back. 
I'm going to get a job and make my own money. 
I am sick and tired of having to justify myself to you every time something pretty goes on sale. 
Come on, Harry, you're going to get a job, too. 
 I am? 
Yes, I will not go unaccessorised. 
I had that dream again last night. 
 Which one? 
The one where I'm riding a tractor and smoking a big cigar. 
Oh, you're ovulating. 
What? 
What are you laughing at? 
Girl talk. 
 Girl talk? 
I'm sorry, did that sound sexist? 
No, sexist would be if you told me I had a tight butt, then said if I didn't go to bed with you, I'd be fired. 
Dr Solomon I really don't think you'd understand what we were talking about. 
I know what this is.. 
me man, me too thick to grasp girl talk. 
Nina, are you going to that lecture series on Thursday? 
Dr. Natalie Blumfeld is speaking. 
 Yes. 
It sounds wonderful. 
Can I come, too? 
It's really not for you. 
It's a place where we can open up and share our feelings. 
I have feelings. 
It's a women's study group. 
I'll take notes. 
Please, let me come. 
Does everything have to involve you? 
In a perfect world, yes. 
I'll be very quiet. 
You won't even know I'm there. 
I think a man's presence would be inhibiting. 
I said you won't even know I'm there! 
Don't take this personally. 
It's not as if we were deliberately trying to exclude you. 
You want to have lunch now? 
 Sure. 
I'd love to. 
Fine! 
I'll have my lunch alone like a man. 
My apple is so tiny. 
These career tests are so stupid. 
I mean, mine suggests I set my sights on optometry or horse training. 
What does yours say? 
 Astronaut. 
Yeah, right, you flying around in space. 
Me? No. 
Like I know anything about anti-Matter containment vessels. 
Tommy, you know what we should do? 
Backpack around Ireland for a few months. 
Yeah, yeah. When? 
 After we graduate. 
Oh. 
Or, better yet, we could move to new York and rent a loft in the village with a view of the river. 
It'll probably cost about... 
300 bucks a month, but, you know, that's okay. 
We'll find jobs in bookstores. 
Uh-huh. 
 Tommy, give me some feedback. 
It sounds great. 
Then why are you being so noncommittal. 
I, I... I don't know. 
Is it me? 
Would you rather do stuff without me? 
I'm not sure if I'm even going to be here in five years. 
I know what this is. 
You don't want to commit to me because you're not sure I'm your soulmate. 
When you're done sorting out your feelings, give me a call. 
No, wait, August. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
I think that... 
we've reached a point in our relationship where I can tell you the truth about me. 
I care more about you than anything , and as long as I'm on this planet, I want to be with you. 
There, now aren't you glad you sorted out your feelings? 
Oh, yeah. 
Oh, boy, did we luck out. 
Not everybody can walk in off the street and get a job at a pancake house. 
Harry, what are you doing? 
Well, the training manual said no hair below the shoulders. 
Now, I don't think anybody's going to look there, but, uh... 
you know, a rule's a rule. 
Hey, um... 
listen, I got a question for you. 
We've been on this planet awhile now, and I was just wondering, if we were to tell someone we cared about where we were actually from, do you think it would be so dangerous? 
No, not at all, Tommy. 
In fact, I've already told Mrs. Dubcek and the mailman.. 
ooh, and that nice guy down at the minimart because I want us all to die like lab rats at the hands of primitive scientists! 
Okay. 
Sally, I'm right again. 
I returned to the store, I sent back your extravagant purchases, and I met a lovely saleswoman named Gwen, and the two of us effortlessly put together a thrifty yet stylish ensemble. 
Behold. 
 Big deal. It's just a little black dress. 
Ah, to the untrained eye, but add a faux jacquard scarf and a pair of pearl button earrings, and look. 
Ooh! 
And this skirt. 
It's an economical acrylic blend, but look how it drapes. 
And the vertical stripes are so slimming. 
ah! 
You like? 
 Nice. 
All right, now, Sally, since I've opened your eyes to a whole new world of options, you can return me the favour. 
Dr. Albright belongs 
to a women's study group, and I must find out what she's doing there. 
God knows you don't want to respect her boundaries. 
Exactly. 
Does August ever belong to a secret women's organization? 
Sure, the girl scouts. 
But she got out because she thought the cookie-selling verged on racketeering. 
Lieutenant, you have your assignment. 
I can't help you, Dick. 
As of today, I've suited up and joined the proud ranks of the work force. 
Come on, Pepe! 
Lieutenant, please. 
I'll show you 50 ways to tie a scarf. 
Tommy, could you.. 
 No, Dick. 
I've got to find out what she's doing. 
Hmm, a study group for women. 
Women only. 
I have to find someone to infiltrate this group, but who? 
Who? 
Hey, you got any real syrup? 
Why, yes, we do, sir, but may I suggest... 
a dash of boysenberry to bring out the hidden oakiness in your otherwise common Vermont maple? 
Enjoy it, Mr. Grabby. 
Uh, whoa. 
Let me ask you something. 
Was your service quick and courteous? 
 Yes. 
Was your food hot and exactly what you ordered? 
Yes. 
 Move over, sweetie. 
Then why is it, my friend, when I subtract your check from the amount on the tray, I come up with 97 cents for me? 
I didn't think you'd count it in front of me. 
But you're glad I did, now, aren't you? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Because now you understand that a tip is short for gratuity, and gratuity is short for gratitude. 
I never heard that, ma'am. 
 Don't interrupt me. 
Gratitude for a job well-done. 
Now, 5% is not gratitude, mister, it's an invitation to an ass-kicking. 
Got it? 
 Got it. 
Thank you. 
Have a nice day! 
I'm doing great! 
So, split ends.. 
is that serious? 
No, but they're driving me crazy. 
Um, August, if I told you a secret, do you think you could handle it? 
You've been keeping secrets from me? 
This is not just any secret. 
This is.. this is 
a really big secret. 
You've been keeping big secrets from me? 
Well, not just you. 
 I've told you about my impetigo. 
I know, I know, it made me feel very close to you. 
But, see, my secret's a lot more serious than just a contagious skin rash. 
You don't trust me. 
 No, no, it's not that. 
I just don't want to go blabbing things out when I'm afraid there might be a fearful, ignorant reaction. 
I understand. 
Good. 
Oh, jeez, if I'd known you could just cut this off, I would have done it months ago. 
Welcome. My name is Judith. 
 Thank you, Judith. 
We have beverages as well as hummus and pita, if you'd like. 
Why not? I'm wearing control tops. 
Oh, pardon me. 
 No, it's entirely my.. 
oh, my.. 
Nina, it's me, Dr. Solomon. 
Oh. 
I'm wearing women's clothes. 
Ah, that's it. 
Wait right here. 
Dr. Albright. 
Dr. Albright. 
Nina, can't this wait? 
 I don't think so. 
Dr. Blumfeld is in the middle 
of a very interesting story. 
Yeah? Well, mine's better. 
 You're hurting my arm. 
Okay. 
 Where were we? 
Mary, let's not monopolize Dr. Blumfeld. Have a seat. 
All right, ladies, we're ready to begin. Everybody settle. 
I'll just squeeze in over here. 
Hello. 
What are you doing here? 
Do you hate me? 
Don't be ridiculous. 
Do you ever have this little voice in your head that says this might be a bad idea? 
shh! 
I'd like to start by having everyone ask herself a question: how am I censoring myself? 
What am I doing to inhibit my relationship with those around me by concealing my true self? 
I have a thought on that. 
 Don't you dare. 
Yes. 
Thank You. 
I work in an office, and I find that I have to censor my feelings just to fit in. 
I'm often excluded, and whenever I do summon the courage to express my desire to be embraced by the group, I find myself muzzled and squelched by them. 
We're here to support each other. 
Please go on. 
And you are? 
Dicki Jo. 
Dicki Jo? 
 Don't mock me. 
I'm being excluded and sequestered because of my sex. 
I can feel the air change in the room when I walk in, and I just think it's so unfair. 
Just stop it. 
Stop it. 
Big girl. 
Pretty, but big. 
I will not. 
Why do women have to close themselves off? 
They don't. 
Let it out. 
I wouldn't encourage Dicki Jo. 
Mary, let her speak. 
Yeah, you go, girl! 
Mary, why do you withhold, pretending there's something inside you that I can't understand? 
We're both grown-ups. 
What are you afraid of? 
Not here, not now. 
 Dr. Blumfeld is right. 
We can't hold ourselves back any longer. 
Knock, knock. 
Who's there? Me! 
Go away! 
It's too late. 
I'm here. 
I knew it all along. 
 Me, too. 
Hey. 
I just wanted to say that I've invested a lot in this relationship, and if you think you can treat me this way, you're wrong. 
Your hair looks really good. 
Oh, thanks. 
August, I can't stand this anymore. 
I have to tell you something. 
You're not going to believe this at first. 
It might even make you sick. 
It's about my family. 
Well, that was a wash. 
The woman I love won't let me be a woman. 
I need some herbal tea and a fat-free cookie. 
Listen, August, what I needed to tell you was that.. 
don't speak, Tommy. 
Don't speak. 
So, Harry, how much did we make? 
I'll get our tip jar. 
 Whew! You know, 
I have never been so fulfilled. 
For the first time as a human, I feel a sense of accomplishment and worth. 
Wow! 
$27.15. 
Come on. You must have 
missed a couple of hundreds. 
Let me see this. 
I worked eight stinkin' hours for a lousy pile of pennies? 
I could've found this in a couch. 
Remember, we're splitting it. 
 Shut up! 
$27.15? 
Ooh! 
and a mento. 
Not a mento. 
These just came for you. 
If you think flowers can repair the damage, you are so wrong. 
They're not from him. 
They're from Judith. 
You want me to read the card? 
 No. 
Please? 
 No! 
Well, another place I will never be able to go to again. 
Why not? They were 
very supportive. 
Did you learn nothing about women? I did. 
You are the biggest fool I have ever known. 
Really, is that what you think? 
To say that you behaved childishly is an insult to children everywhere. 
That's it, open up. 
Talk to me. 
I... am 
a merry-go-round person. 
You are a tilt-a-whirl person. 
This is good. 
Tell me your feelings. 
Before you came into this office, I had a very sane and ordered life. 
I could go for weeks without explaining myself, and now the sky's the limit! 
You drive me crazy! 
I do all this to you? 
 Yes! 
Well, I must be a pretty exciting guy. 
Now, that's good. 
Now we're communicating. Now 
I know what you're thinking. 
What am I thinking? 
You like me. 
You really like me. 
Sally, is there anything you'd like to tell me as a woman? 
I think I'm enlightened enough now to hear it. 
Ah, well, men are always bossing you around. 
No one ever says "thank you. 
And you're expected to clean up after everyone Are you talking about being a woman or a waitress Waitress, woman.. 
same thing. 
I just never realized how many people here are in the service of others. 
Well, everybody here sells his time for money It's like taking a mortgage against your life. 
Yeah, well, my life is worth more than minimum wage and the occasional slice of free pie. 
I've just got to figure out what it is I really want to do. 
I think you should. 
Everybody needs a goal. 
Yeah, I want to let my hair grow back. 
I want to make the world a better place. 
I want to bring mankind the gift of electricity. 
They have electricity. 
 Ah. 
Then my work is done. 
Aliens are all around us. 
This is the story of a band of four such explorers. 
In order to blend in they have assumed human form. 
This is the high commander. 
He has assembled an elite team of experts. 
A decorated military officer. 
A seasoned intelligent specialist. 
And...well, they had an extra seat. 
They say Earth started with just two humans. 
Now there are five billion. 
Somebody needs to turn a hose on them. 
And the winning lottery numbers are: 2, 21... - Uh-huh. 
51...- Yes. 9, 27... and 48. 
We won again! 
Ah! That was fun. 
A dollar well spent. 
If luck were money, we'd be rich. 
 Yes. 
Hey, look at them. 
They're not kissing. 
They're not groping. They're... 
ooh, I know this. 
Cuddling, cuddling is interesting. 
It's both romantic and sexual. 
Yes, but it's more than that. 
It implies an intimate relationship. 
How do you establish that with a woman? 
Why are you looking at me? 
Because you're the woman. 
 Yeah, for two whole months, but I haven't even figured out how to take off my bra yet. 
I want a hug. 
I want to hug Dr. Albright. 
I want to hug her right now. 
She's not here. 
 I'm going to have to hug somebody. 
It's just not the same with you. 
Well my heart wasn't in it, either. 
I just let you do it 'cause you're high commander. 
I feel... so cheap. 
Dick, I can't take this housework anymore. 
I was put on this mission because of my military skills. 
These hands are lethal weapons, but now they're all red and dry from harsh detergents. 
Stop complaining. Your 
assignment is to be the woman, just like Tommy's assignment is to study earth culture. 
Right, and I'm on it. 
That's why I'm reading "Betty and veronica's summer fun." 
My god! These are 
high school girls? 
Okay, you guys, I was out walking and someone started following me. 
Oh, my god. 
 He's in the living room. 
You let him in our home? 
 Well, yeah. 
He might be worth studying. 
Come on in! 
Aw! 
 Oh! 
What a good little man. 
Harry, that's a dog. 
You know, you are just so quick to label. 
He's so huggable. 
"oh mama". 
I've got to get to the office and Dr. Albright. 
What are you going to do? 
Well, I'm going to start, by establishing communication. 
Oh, have a seat, my friend. 
There. 
What's he trying to say? 
 He said that lassie's a guy. 
Good morning, Dr. Albright. 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
I have your physics book. 
Oh, thank you. 
Oh! Please don't do that. 
I'm not much of a hugger. 
Oh. 
Look who I found wandering down the halls. 
Mary. 
 Oh, my god! Oh! 
Oh..er...Dr Richard Solomon. 
this is Dr. Jeff Willis, 
my old dear friend. 
Hi. Actually, Mary and I 
used to share this office. 
Among other things. 
 Nina. 
So, what brings you to town? 
A book signing. 
My novel's been published. 
"Echoes of my stepfather." 
Yes. 
You've finally finished. 
Oh, it's wonderful! 
Oh! 
 Mmm! 
Oh! I've got 
to get to class. 
Listen, We have got to get together and catch up. 
You got it. 
 Call me. 
Oh! 
 Oh! 
Oh! 
She is something else. 
Hmm, I can't believe how good you look. 
You still playing racquetball? 
 Every day. 
Ooh! I love it! 
I love it more! 
You don't play racquetball. 
Poor, sweet, misguided, amnesiac Nina, of course I do. 
I've got some time to kill. 
I'd love to play. 
I've got some time to play I'd love to kill. 
Can I help you? 
 No, thanks. Just looking. 
Hey! It says "men" 
on the door. 
And you made the cut? 
Ooh, Sally. 
Dick. 
Okay, here's everything you need to know about racquetball. 
Oh thanks for bringing this, lieutenant. 
Well, I found myself starting to talk to the scrubbing bubbles, so I figured I better take a walk. 
This is Newtonian physics... 
trajectory and velocity. 
An imbecilic baby could do it. 
Well, I'm off to the games. 
Play fiercely and annihilate your opponent. 
As it always was and always will be. 
Hey... 
it's dry already. 
Put your shorts on. 
I won! ..I won! 
I won! 
Did you hear the news? 
I won. 
Congratulations, Dick. 
 - That was so easy. 
You offered me no challenge at all. 
Yeah, I was kind of off my game. 
Off your game? You played like a little girl. 
Too bad Mary wasn't here to see it. 
That reminds me, I gotta run. 
I'm meeting her for lunch. 
Well, I hope you two girls have fun. 
Why am I so hostile to this Jeff person? 
He's never done anything to me. 
In fact, he seems like a perfectly tolerable... twit. 
But for some reason, I hate him just because Dr. Albright 
likes him. Why? 
It's called jealousy Dick. 
It's what happens to moose when Reggie flirts with midge. 
If you'd read a little, you'd know something about this. 
I don't have time to read. 
Lieutenant, get out here. 
I have a new assignment for you. 
 Yes? Finally. 
I want you to find out what makes a man so irresistible, that a woman has no interest in any other man. 
That's still a chick job. 
Yes...but it's also a chick job to 
help the high commander score. 
You want to know about love? 
I'll show you love. 
Scruffy, come here. 
Come here. 
Oh, see? He loves me for no reason. 
He lives just to bask in the light of my smile. 
And the best thing is, we both scare the mailman. 
Why can't Dr. Albright leap into my lap 
and lick my face? 
Well, some breeds are more skittish than others. 
You two were here last night. 
Miss? 
Miss! 
You're obviously in some sort of relationship. Why'd you pick this guy? 
What's that supposed to mean? 
 Hey, I'm talking to the lady. 
He's not terribly attractive. 
He's got bad taste in clothes. 
Even I can tell he doesn't know what he's doing. 
 I wouldn't say ah! It's the car, 
isn't it? 
No! 
Yes, it's the car. 
Thank you. 
What are you doing? 
 Tempting you with the great taste of bacon. 
I'm going to take these folders in to Nina, and when I come back, you'll be gone. 
Hi. Mary here? 
Uh, no, she just left for Cleveland. 
Oh look, she's back. 
What are you doing here? 
 I'm on my way to a meeting, but I wanted to stop off and give you a present. 
Ohhhh "Thanks for bugging me to write my book."....Oh Jeff. 
It's a thimble. 
I collect them. 
It's an ancient Ukrainian quilting thimble, there's some writing. I didn't 
have time to get it translated. 
Well, you've been so busy with the book. 
Speaking of time, don't you have a meeting? 
Right. 
I gotta go. Bye. 
Oh! 
 Ohhhhhh! 
Damn, they did it again! 
Oh! 
I'm going to have to find someone who can translate Ukrainian. 
Ah, that's not Ukrainian. 
It's Turkish. 
Look, there's a diacritical mark over the "O." 
Well, what does it mean? 
"May these always point me toward the spoils of war". 
This isn't a thimble. 
It's Turkish nipple armour. 
Well, it's...very valuable 
Well, especially if you have a pair. 
Ohhhh...... Don't tell Jeff. 
This will be our secret. 
 Yes, our secret. 
It will be something Jeff will never have. 
Well, it's the thought that counts. 
This must have been very expensive. 
Oh, so you like expensive things? 
No.......Some of my favorite things 
in life cost nothing.. 
a picnic on a sunny day, a lovely poem read aloud, watching my friends fail. 
Well, I have a marvelous idea. 
I'll write a poem about your friends failing, and read it to you aloud on a sunny picnic. 
That sounds wonderful. 
 How about Saturday afternoon? 
Why not? 
I have a date. 
Jeff doesn't have a date... 
but I have a date. 
Yes! 
"Women who run with the wolves," "women who love too much," "women who love too fast," "women who love to read about women who love too much and too fast." 
Oh, my god. 
Excuse me. 
You two have been together, what, 100, 150 years? 
42 this April. 
42 years. 
Impressive. 
You must have known he was something really special, huh? 
Tell me, why'd you pick him? 
Well, he was very sweet,.... 
and affectionate. 
He had a real flair for romance. 
It was the car, wasn't it? 
That was the clincher. 
Oh finally. Did you get 'em? 
 Yes. 
Permission to speak freely, sir? 
 Yeah, sure. 
You and I have flown a lot of missions together. 
If you asked me to put out the sun with my bare hands, I would, no questions asked. 
But if you ever send me out in broad daylight to pick up a bunch of women's magazines again, I will kill you. 
This may sound silly to you, but I have a date with Dr. Albright, 
and I want to be sure to say the right thing. Now help me out here. 
Dick, they're pointless. 
They're mind-altering. 
They impose arbitrary standards on women. 
It's like propaganda for some sort of estrogen cult. 
Just read. 
Okay. 
Okay, here's a topic. 
You could discuss biology. 
Why? 
 According to a recent survey, 7 out of 10 women have multiple organisms. 
You have to. 
 Harry: no, you're not the boss of me. 
You have to. 
Check to the lease. 
What's the problem? 
 Mrs. Dubcek doesn't like scruffy. 
The lease says no pets. 
But he's so cute. - No! I'm allergic 
to dogs. 
My throat closes off and I can't breathe. 
But he's so cute. 
 No! I can't breathe. 
No, no. Sorry.  
No, the pooch cannot stay. 
But he's so cute! 
 Noooo ! 
That's too bad, Harry. 
I guess you know what you have to do. 
Yes, scruffy and I must kill Mrs. Dubcek... 
and hide her body under the floorboards. 
Wh...what are you doing here? 
 We're going on our picnic. 
Didn't you get my message? 
 No. Why? 
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I had to cancel. 
Cancel? 
 Well, it's Jeff's book signing party. 
But you don't understand. 
I beat him in racquetball. 
I can't miss it. He 
dedicated his novel to me. 
Oh, no, you can't miss that. 
Why don't you come? 
Come?  oh no, I've got 
things to do. 
I have to take my black forest ham, my wheel of Brie, my Cabernet sauvignon, my Limoges trivet, throw them in the front yard and set them ablaze in a big bonfire as a tribute to Jeff's book signing! 
Excuse me, I'm looking for Jeff Willis. 
He's with his publicist. 
He'll be out shortly. 
Are you a friend? 
Ah Yes. I'm very close 
to the steaming pustule. 
Harry, I've solved your problem. 
This young lady needs a dog for her little girl. 
Oh, he's perfect. 
hmm, no.  Scruffy's not about 
to ruin his life, by running off with some blonde he met at a cocktail party. 
The man of the hour. 
Oh, god. 
 You think you're pretty clever, don't you? 
I happen to know that every word in your book was published years ago! 
Perhaps you've read the dictionary. 
You invited me. 
This is your fault. 
Jeff Willis, I challenge you for the hand of the woman we both love! 
Emily, I knew you were cheating on me. 
No. He's lying, 
I swear. 
You love her? 
 My own wife? 
So you love her? 
 I've never seen this man before in my life. 
Lay off her, Jeff. I'm the one that's 
been sleeping with your wife, Okay? 
My own brother? 
One answer, and I'll get out of your way. You love her? 
And you know what? 
The sex is great. 
You satanic bastard. 
You fraud! 
 What an interesting family. 
 Look what you've done. 
This is very hard for you, isn't it? 
It's the hardest thing I've had to do in my entire time on this planet. 
Scruffy, come here. 
You're getting on my nerves, mutt. 
So take a hike. 
Go with the kid. 
I'm bad news, junior. 
I'm trouble, I tell ya. 
Just go! 
Oh. 
Who am I kidding? 
Well, would you like to walk him over to our place? 
Oh, sure. 
Harry, you can come over and play with scruffy anytime you want to. 
Really? 
 Yeah, we'd love it. 
After my ex-husband, it's a pleasure to meet a man who's so caring. 
Oh. 
Jeff's brother needs his jaw wired, I hope you're proud of yourself. 
You're mad at me. 
That's fine, I'm mad at you. 
Why are you mad at me? 
You're the expert. 
You tell me. 
Dr. Solomon, what do 
you want from me? 
I want... 
I want to be your boyfriend. 
Oh. 
 Are you surprised? 
To be honest....not really. 
Well, then what's the problem? 
Well...honestly, there's 
something about you.. 
that... seems odd. 
with every other person on the planet. 
How can that be? Every day 
I go out of my way to do things that appear normal. 
What you just said, that's not normal. 
What else? 
 Well, you... 
you act as if you're feeling everything for the first time. 
You have no control over your emotions. 
You tried to feed me doggy treats. 
And? 
You're moving way too fast. 
Whatever is going to happen between us, let's let it evolve naturally. 
All right, I can go along with that. 
Good. 
 Why don't we shake on it? 
Why don't we hug on it? 
 No, that's too.. 
Dr. Albright, please? 
You don't know how important this hug is to me. 
It would give my life a degree of meaning that I've only dreamed of. 
All right. 
No, I can't hug under this pressure. 
Try. 
There. 
That's all I was asking for. 
I want to have your baby. 
You know, jealousy defies all logic. 
Jeff's a nice person. 
Dr. Albright's 
a nice person. 
But... the thought 
of them being happy together just made me crazy. 
You think that's bad? 
Clark Kent gets jealous because Lois lane likes superman. 
Now, that is crazy. 
Dick, you know, I finally figured out what women really want in a man. 
They want him to drive a big, powerful vehicle. 
You're saying I should be a bus driver? 
Hey, you'll be beating them off with a stick. 
Dick, if you want to know how to get what you want from the ladies, the answer is simple. 
 What? 
Get a dog. 
Wait  Harry, you didn't? 
No. 
What is your problem? 
 I'm sorry. 
I just can't believe what passed for literature in the '70s. 
Knock, knock, knock. 
This delivery came for you C.O.D. 
You weren't here, so I paid the guy. 
Thank you. 
That saves me 28 dollars plus 5 dollars shipping and handling. 
What is it? 
It's something to warm up my side of the office. 
Dr. Albright has her 
collection of tribal death masks, and now I have these. 
Look at this one. 
It says, "plan ahead", but the person who made it forgot to. 
Take that, Mr. Advice giver. Pow! 
"You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps". 
It sure does! 
I can't wait to show these to Dr. Albright and Nina. 
You know, over time, I've come to think of them less as my co-workers and more like a family. 
I'm the all-knowing father, Mary's the wife, and Nina is our adopted love child. 
Well, I better be going. 
The forecast for today is laughter. 
So, Sally, you still want me to teach you to make guacamole? 
Yeah. I planned 
my whole day around it. 
Okay. Now... ow! ow! 
Darn. 
You're bleeding. 
 Oh, no, no, I'll be fine. 
Just get me a little gauze. 
 Sure, I can handle that. 
It's just a little flesh wound. 
I've inflicted far worse than that thousands of times. 
Of course, never on creatures who bleed. 
I'll just... 
 Oh! 
Sally, are you okay? 
 I know what to do. 
I've seen this before. We've 
gotta get this woman to the E.R. 
Don't worry. Get her into the living room. 
I'll put a damp cloth on her forehead. She'll be fine. 
Oh, she's a big girl. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
I'm losing her. 
Oh! I'm sorry. 
 Watch out for the post. 
 Huh? 
Wait, I gotta rest for a second. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
You know, maybe the emergency room isn't such a bad idea. 
Let's get her downstairs and load her into my el Camino. 
Careful, careful. 
 Don't drop her down the stairs. 
Huh? 
I said "don't" drop her down the stairs. 
Oh-hh! 
"One of these days I am going to get Organizized". 
Funny. 
I knew you'd love it. Whoever 
wrote this is a raving genius. 
I have the best news! 
Professor fuscoe has been hired by Princeton. 
I didn't know the two of you were so close. 
 I think he's a moron, but I get his office! 
The big office with the bay window and the view of the apple tree? 
 Yes! 
Nina, you would have been so proud of me. 
As soon as I heard it was available I went to that overly friendly woman who handles these things. 
Yeah. What is her problem? 
 Who cares? Anyway.. 
It was between me and professor Suter, and I said, "Mr. Suter 
is a very nice old man, but he seems very content in his broom closet. Why disturb him"? 
And she bought it! 
Oh oh, this is wonderful! 
My funny signs will look just great in the new office. 
I'll leave the two of you alone now. 
Ah, the thing is, the new office, it's a single. 
Great! We can share 
the same desk. 
No, you have to stay here. 
Oh, I see. 
You're leaving me. 
I guess it was a mistake to get so close. 
Well, we'll still see each other. 
Oh Please, don't patronize me. Just go. 
Dick, I've never had my own office. 
I've waited 12 years for this, and I need the extra space for my artifacts. 
To hell with your tchotchkes! 
I want you to stay here! 
Well, Sometimes you can't get what you want. 
You're getting what you want. 
 Sometimes you can. 
I need boxes! 
Fine. 
Mr. Potato man is 
all the company I need. 
Right? 
Answer me! 
She looks just like snow white. 
Snow white with dried spittle on her chin. 
Where am I? 
 You're in the hospital. 
Oh, good, honey, you're out of the woods. 
I'm going to run upstairs and see a friend of mine. 
"She just went from a double "d" cup to a "B". 
What, intentionally? 
I know. 
Can you believe that? 
What happened? 
 You fainted. 
Oh, Sally, you just gotta pull through. 
 Ahh! 
But you're a fighter. 
You've always been a fighter. 
Oh, my god, why are you talking like that? Am I dying? 
Oh no no, that's just the way they talk on those medical dramas. 
Damn it! 
Okay, Miss Solomon. 
You might have a slight concussion from your fall. 
I'd like to keep you overnight for observation. 
Well... 
am I going to be all right? 
Don't you worry about a thing. 
We take good care of people here. 
Oh, thank you. 
I don't know why, but that made me feel better. 
Can I have a word with you, doctor? 
What is it? 
 This woman is the only sister I've got, and if that means having to use your best doctors and nurses, well, I'm just going to have to live with that... 
damn it. 
Dr. Solomon, 
I'm Judith. 
I'm going to be sharing this office with you. 
 Judith. 
This is my assistant.. 
my brother, Roger. 
Roger. 
Please don't shake my hand. 
I've just washed it. 
Two rules: when I do not wish to be disturbed, I will place my nameplate face down on my desk. 
And in the morning, whoever arrives first will flip on the ionizer. 
You know, the woman who was previously in this office had no trouble with the level of ionization. 
Believe me, you will like me, most people do. 
Ha! well, 
this is nice. 
I rush all the way over here, and I find you lolling around in bed. 
Dick, it was so scary. 
I was completely unconscious for a half hour. 
Lucky you. After today, 
I'd pay to be unconscious. 
What happened? 
 Mary moved into a new office. 
Uh-huh? 
 Meaning? 
I don't want her to move. 
I don't care if it's the office of her dreams. 
I don't care if she's never been happier. I'm so lonesome, I could die. 
Hello! Sally's 
in the hospital. 
Oh...yeah..anyway.. 
from now on, I'm thinking only of myself. 
I'm going to be completely.. 
 what's the word for it? 
Selfish. 
 No, Smart. 
I'm getting her back, no matter what. 
I thought you said she was happy there. 
 She thinks she is, but what does she know? 
I'm the high commander. I 
know what's best for everything. 
Now, why was I here? 
Oh, right. Get well. 
That's an order. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to liberate old man Suter from his broom closet. 
I brought you some jell-o... 
Ahhh aahh aah! 
Professor Suter, a terrible injustice has been done. 
What? 
I said, a terrible injustice has been done! 
I heard you. 
What's the big injustice? 
Somebody has taken something that rightfully belongs to you. 
 What? 
Somebody has taken something that rightfully belongs to you! 
Are you okay? 
Professor Suter? 
Are you okay?! 
Yes, the one with the bay window and the apple tree. 
How long has it been since we talked? 
Seven years? Well, you be good. Bye-bye. 
Company. 
 Look who I ran into Mary. 
You remember professor Suter. 
Hello, Mary. 
 Hello, professor. 
Dr. Solomon told me 
about your good fortune. 
I wanted to say congratulations. 
Thank you. 
I used to have an eye out for this office. 
Ah, the bay window! 
And the apple tree. 
My wife and I used to picnic under it all the time. 
She's dead now. 
 Oh. 
Mary, you have better eyes than I. 
Do you see anything carved on the trunk out there? 
No. 
Oh I see it. 
It's a heart. 
A heart, Mary. 
I carved it on the day I proposed, right before I went out to fight the Germans. 
 Oh. 
You must have loved her very much. 
You'll never know. 
Mary, I have a very special favour to ask of you. 
What? 
Could you some afternoon help me gather apple blossoms and then take them with me to my wife's grave? 
'Kay. 
Bless you, Mary. 
 Come on, professor Suter. 
Let me walk you down to your... tiny office. 
I think Dr. Albright 
wants to be alone with her thoughts. 
Don't you let him manipulate you. 
This is your office. I'm not just 
saying that because I finally got a window. 
I'm being objective. 
 I know you are, but I'm starting to feel bad. 
You listen to me, woman. 
Keep the dream alive. 
I'm really going to miss this place. 
Yeah, but you got some lovely prizes. 
I know. 
A sipper cup, a pair of circulation socks and a kidney-shaped salad bowl. 
Sweet! 
 I could just hang out here all day. 
I know, it's like Disneyland with a slightly higher fatality rate. 
Hey, look what I got. 
Ooh! 
 Wow! 
It was just hanging over there behind a door. 
Whoa! 
are there any left? 
Yeah, and the best part is, you can go anywhere you want to, people treat you like a god, and you get 10% off everything at the gift shop. 
Let's go. 
I need two more units of "o" negative. 10 cc's of narcane. 
Come on. 
 I want done directly now. Do it. 
Whoa! Here comes 
another one. 
Check for vitals. 
 Rest: 12, bp: 140/100. 
Got a difficult airway. 
Can't get through. 
probably ruptured his aorta. 
 All right, hold his legs. 
It just never ends. 
 And what if it did? 
Let's just pray that day never comes. 
Let's go. 
 Yeah! 
So... 
you got plans for tonight? 
Personally, you kidding? 
I could sleep forever. 
When's our next shift? 
Well, it's hard to say. 
We're not doctors. 
Hello, everyone! 
 You're in a good mood. 
I'm in a great mood. 
 Did Dr. Albright move back in with you? 
Not yet. 
But today I realised it's not about getting Mary back and getting what I want. 
It's about getting justice for professor Suter... 
and getting what I want. 
So I called up the Dean, and I told him it was a travesty to keep a 75-year-old man locked away in the basement. 
Now I'm ready to... 
par-tay. 
So what are we celebrating, brotha? 
My ruthless commitment to myself. 
Wow. You're not just 
the high commander, you're presidential material. 
Looks like a burst appendix. 
Don't let the saline count fool you. 
I know this man is a diabetic. 
No, he isn't. 
 You're suspended. 
She's going to be all right, isn't she? 
She's going to be fine. 
Here, let me show you what a doctor once did for me. 
Everything's going to be all right. 
We take good care of people here. 
Thank you, doctor. 
This must be a tough job. 
 Oh, ugh. 
I've seen stuff that would make your eyes pop out of your head and splatter against the wall. 
In fact, I have seen that, too. 
Looks like a burst appendix. 
Don't let the saline count fool you. 
I know this man is a diabetic. 
This is a uterus. 
You're suspended. 
Father rice, I find myself in the midst of a moral dilemma. 
That's why we have a theology department, Dick. 
What can I do for you? 
 It's professor Albright. 
She's strayed. 
No news there. 
Uh...who is it this time? 
Professor Suter. 
Ooh. 
That's why, father, I implore you to use your position to shame her. 
Uh, that's not exactly what we do anymore. 
Someone's got to get her out of that new office. 
New office? 
Up on the second floor. 
Bay window, apple tree? 
 Yeah, that's the one. 
I'll be darned. 
I hadn't heard. 
So Albright got that office, huh? 
Hmm. Thank you, Dick. 
Roger says you must never leave these on his desk again. 
Whatever. 
"One of these days I am going to get Organizized". 
That's marvelous! 
It's moronic! 
Now be quiet. 
There you are. 
You were right. 
It was a burst appendix. 
The saline count fooled me. 
I didn't know he had diabetes. He'll live now. 
Remember this face... 
and beg that one day you'll be half the professional that.. 
Dr. Moshepipchik is. 
Get out of my way. 
Can't you people see I'm carrying a box? 
Nina! 
Mary, you're back. 
 Yes, I'm back. 
Dean Sumner said it was an oversight, that he had already promised my office to someone else. 
Backstabbing weasel. That's 
the last time I suck up to him. 
Professor Suter. 
So I guess everything worked out, huh? 
Oh, shut up. 
Thanks to that idiot campaign you mounted on my behalf, they're forcing me to retire. 
 Why? 
Because you reminded them I was over 70 and still on the payroll. 
I haven't taught a class in four years. 
What have you been doing all this time? 
Working on my screenplay. 
It's like "die hard", but it's set in an office building. 
"Die hard" was in an office building. 
Up yours. 
Mary? 
 What? 
Somewhere in the recesses of your heart, aren't you just the tiniest bit happy that we're a family again? 
This isn't oncology. 
This is a hospital, damn it. 
Aww ha, look at all the little people! 
Hello, precious. 
Hello! 
 Wow! 
That one right there looks just like Winston Churchill. 
So does that one. 
Hey, this one looks like black Winston Churchill. 
It's amazing, isn't it? 
An entire ward of pure distilled life. 
I guess people don't just come here to get repaired. 
Aw! Shh! don't cry sweetheart. 
This part's easy. 
Just wait till you have to choose a long distance carrier. 
I wish I could have started from scratch like you guys.. 
knowing, but not knowing. 
Seeing, and then all at once forgetting. 
Enjoy it. 
Time here moves really fast. 
Father, I've made a terrible mistake. 
In order to get my way, I've harmed a friend.. 
someone I deeply love.. 
a man I barely know, and a large unpleasant woman in sensible shoes. 
I feel just awful. 
Dick? 
All of god's creatures make mistakes, and he forgives them. 
Let me show you something. 
When I walk up to my bay window and see that apple tree outside, I'm reminded of how simple life can be when it becomes less about having and more about being. 
Oh, you're a good man, father, in a really, really great office. 
It is isn't it? 
When I've realized that when getting what you want comes at the expense of others, it's not all satisfying Even if it's the last bag of circus peanuts? 
Well, that would be pretty satisfying. 
This came for you from the hospital. 
 Those people are so nice. 
It's probably a "get well" card. 
It's a bill for 35 hundred dollars. 
Oh, look. It's says, "thank 
you for your prompt payment". 
Did you pay them? 
 No. 
I didn't pay 'em. 
 Wasn't me. 
Well, somebody must have paid them. 
No. 
Oh! Bazooka Joe... 
you're an imbecile! 
Good morning. 
 Dr. Albright. 
I am about to reveal something astounding. 
I think you're overestimating yourself. 
Behold! 
An Atm card. 
Oh. 
Congratulations. 
You're now a member of a very elite group of 2, 3, hundred million Americans. 
My name is raised. You 
can touch it if you want. 
No, thanks. 
When I press it into my forehead.. 
you can read my name backwards. 
Pace yourself, we have a whole semester. 
Nina, did I show you my new.. 
yes, you did, and, no, I don't want to feel it. 
I have a great idea. 
To celebrate, why don't I use my new Atm card to withdraw money from one of many convenient locations, even after business hours, and take you out to dinner tomorrow night? 
All right. 
 Really? 
Yes. 
 You're not just toying with me? 
You do understand it's dinner, out? 
Yes, but it can't just be dinner out of the house. 
It also has to be dinner out of the car. 
Yes. Now all I have to do is 
put this card into the Atm, punch in my secret code, 1-2-3-4 oh, no! 
I was never supposed to reveal my code to anyone! 
Ooh, well, now you're going to have to kill us. 
That was the mall. Wasn't it great? 
 How would I know? 
The escalator broke down, and I was stuck there for an hour and a half. 
You know, I think the entire planet should be covered by one big roof. 
And we should never be more than 15 feet from a wienie on a stick. 
Tommy, look what I bought for you. 
 A basketball? 
I've decided that you should join your school's team. 
 Why? 
Because it's important that you experience the humiliation of adolescent boys at the hands of bitter adults trying to rewrite the failures of their youth. 
It'll be fun. 
All right, who ripped the radio out of the dashboard? 
What are you talking about? 
 The radio, it's gone. 
Wait a minute, I know what's happened here. 
You see it all the time on the news. 
Oh, uh... toupees. 
No, crime. 
We're victims of crime! 
What are we supposed to do now? 
The radio's gone. I think we 
all know what we have to do. 
I can't believe Dick did this to me. 
Why do I have to play basketball? 
I know. Team sports are so infantile. 
It's all masculine posturing. 
All the preening and flexing. 
 Exactly. 
What I really hate is that there's some primitive part of me that really responds to that. 
And what I really hate is being cursed with the heart of a champion. 
What is Harry doing? 
 It's part of my new security procedures. 
Oh! Red alert! 
There's a squirrel approaching the building. 
This seems a bit extreme, lieutenant. 
With all due respect, high commander, butt out. 
Security's my domain. I'll 
take the blame for the radio. 
Oh, please. 
 No, I should have been guarding the rambler instead of shopping for loofahs. 
You're overeacting. 
Dick, I have been telling you this planet is in a bad neighborhood. 
We have been on far worse planets than this, inhabited by creatures with far worse breath. 
I mean, at least we're on a planet that's governed by laws. 
You're too distrustful of humans. 
It's just those two little eyes right in the middle of their head. 
Makes 'em all look like they're up to something. 
Knock, knock. 
Hi, hi. I heard about your car radio. 
Did you call the cops? 
 I don't think that's necessary. 
Don't be silly. 
You go down to the station, you ask for officer Franco. 
An Italian gentlemen, very nice. 
He came right over when my boyfriend got beat up in my living room. 
Your boyfriend got beat up in your own house? 
Yeah. Well, my husband 
didn't care for him. 
Wow, I smell the fist of justice. 
I smell doughnuts. 
Can't you feel it, Harry.. 
the stifling sense of order? 
The discipline? The 
almost robotic lack of emotion? 
The fluorescent lights? 
God help me. 
I love it. 
What can I do for You? 
Just let me be near you. 
Okay. 
My name's officer Don. 
Well, officer Don, we're here to report a crime. 
I blame myself. 
I dropped my guard. 
It's not your fault. 
Crime happens. 
On the surface, Rutherford may look like small town America, but just beneath the well-manicured lawns lies a hotbed of criminal activity. 
We may be in the shadow of Cleveland, but it's in the shadows where evil lurks. 
Wow! Hey, 
when you do this, it sort of looks like "Nypd blue." Wow. 
Oh, my. 
Now, what happened? 
The radio was stolen out of our rambler. 
A.M. With those push buttons? 
 Yes. 
Those sick bastards! 
Fill out this form. 
 Form? Then what happens? 
I make a copy of it. 
 And then? 
Then on Thursday a girl comes in and files it. 
Paperwork. 
If I had my way, I'd be out in the streets putting the rats back in their holes. 
Well, Don, if I had a gun like that, I wouldn't be sitting behind a desk until I ran out of bullets. 
Hi. 
So what are you here for? 
Well, they picked me up for vagrancy, but that's not the real reason. 
I'm here because they know. 
They know I'm from the planet clarion in the bard spiral on the Cepheus dracond border. 
Do you know Steve? 
Dear lord, if it be within your great wisdom and mercy, please grant us the strength and courage excuse me, coach. 
 We're in the middle of a prayer Solomon. 
Do you think we should be bothering god over a basketball game? 
This is important. 
 The other team's praying, too. 
Oh, so our god is stronger than their god? 
There's only one god, Solomon. 
Am I the only one seeing a conflict of interest here? 
Yes! All right, 
first in, out on the court! 
Let's go! Hustle it out there! Get out there! 
There you go. 
 Coach, what about me? 
I'm sorry. 
You're not tall enough. 
What are you saying? 
You're too damn short! 
Get outta here. 
Oh! 
Why, yes, I will have another transaction, and this time in...espanol. 
I'll be done in a minute. I 
just want to see what my limit is. 
Take your time. 
 Look at this. 
I put the card in, and money comes out. Card in, money out. 
Oh! 
You see this? As much as I 
want over and over again. 
Isn't it amazing? 
 Yeah. Now give it to me. 
What? 
No, no, no. 
This is my money, but I'm sure you can have your own card.. 
Quit foolin' around. 
I said, hand it over. 
No, let me explain this to you again. 
This $300 is mine, just like the 100 I just put in my wallet. 
Yah! Whoa! Yah! 
This is all my fault. 
What was I thinking, letting you go out by yourself? 
A man who could steal a wallet is capable of anything. 
He could have put you in a vat of saline and harvested your organs over a period of months, forcing you to regenerate kidney after kidney after.. 
will you stop! 
 Now, just relax. 
You've got to calm down. 
 How can I calm down? 
I feel so utterly exposed and vulnerable, and not in that fun spanky way. 
It's all right. 
You're safe now. 
What kind of a place is this where you can't wave handfuls of money around in the middle of the night? 
Sir, did this guy have any distinguishing marks? 
His skin was rather nice. 
Well, Mr. Solomon, I can 
see that you're pretty upset, so I'll just be giving my home phone number... to your sister. 
Call if you have any... needs. 
Oh, why did this have to happen? 
 It was late. 
Why did I have to be at that place at that time, taking out all that money? 
Don't blame yourself. 
 I don't, I blame you! 
What?! 
 You had to agree to go out with me. 
You always turn me down. Why 
did you pick now to say yes? 
I don't know. 
 You see, you weren't thinking. 
You can't take a random act and turn it around to blame an innocent person. 
Just watch me. 
 Why did I think tonight would be any different? 
You are insane. 
 It's the world that's insane! 
They talk about the universe being random. Ha! 
This is the place that's random. 
 I'm leaving. 
People assaulting total strangers for no other reason than to take their money! 
That's right, run away from the problem! 
Sooner or later you're going to have to come to terms with the fact that the earth is a cold, dark and evil place crawling with crazed ne'er-do-wells and arsenate jackanapes! 
Well, I don't like it! 
Lieutenant! 
 Yes, sir. 
This planet has crossed the line. 
Assemble the giant robot. 
We didn't pack it. 
 We didn't? Why not? 
I wanted to, but you needed the room for your exercise bike, which, I might add, you never use. 
The strengths of the refracted light varies... 
in accordance with its velocity as measured in light years per second. 
 Dr. Solomon. 
What is it, Leon? 
 Why are you writing like that? 
Because we live in world where, as soon as you turn around, someone is waiting to stab you in the back and steal your wallet. 
Dr. Solomon, you have to 
have more faith in people. 
You know, I think that deep down there's a basic decency.. 
oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
Your chirpy optimism has no place in reality. 
Guess what. 
Santa Claus is dead! 
Beaten senseless for his shiny black boots! 
And his reindeer don't give a damn! 
You know, Dr. Solomon, 
you seem to be carrying around so much baggage. 
You're not getting any of it, so get away from me! 
Okay, Let's get this straight. 
I don't care how much it costs. 
I don't care how difficult it is to accomplish. 
I want a security system that will guarantee that every moment of our lives will be filled with a sense of absolute safety and contentment. 
That would be the electro fort 2000. 
The alarm connects directly to our command center downtown where we immediately dispatch trained patrolmen to your door. 
I see. I just 
have one question. 
Sure. 
 Where do I bury my family after the burglars have pumped bullets into their skulls while your guys are strolling over? 
That almost never happens. 
May I have a glass of water? 
Where's Tommy? 
He should be here. 
It's all under control. He's in 
the driveway playing one-on-one. 
Tommy.. Tommy, 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't know I'd be that good. I've never played before. 
Your company is obviously run by amateurs. 
This is totally unsatisfactory. 
Allow me to show you a few schematics that I drew up. 
Okay..now, the giant 
swinging blade would fall from here. 
Steel spikes plunge into the burglar's eyes here. 
And the conveyor belt drops the carcass into the tank of great white sharks here, here... and here. 
It'll work. 
Now, that's a plan. 
Let's go, girls, don't forget about defence for crying out loud! 
Coach. 
 What? 
We're up 40 points with two minutes to go. Come on, put me in. 
I promise I won't touch anything. 
I'll just stand there. 
Well.....erm.......No! 
Ohh! Come on Coach, my girlfriend's 
watching. 
This is not just my chance. 
This is your chance to be remembered as the beloved coach Strickland and not as coach suckland. 
That wasn't mine. 
Okay, Solomon, enough. 
I'll put you in. Just shut up. 
Thanks, coach. 
 You know where player Hansen is? 
The guy with the neck thicker than my waist? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
You go stop him from driving the lane. 
 All right. 
Good job. 
Good morning. 
 How are you feeling? 
Wired, thank you. My entire 
house is wired for security. 
This afternoon I'm getting an alarm system for the car. 
Oh, good. Now all you need 
is an armed guard to walk you from the house to the car. Then you'll be all set. 
What a good idea. 
A big scary one. I could hire a criminal. 
 Ooh. 
They're taking my money anyway. 
Why not give it to them hourly? 
All right, stop. 
Now you are a victim. 
You have lost all trust in humanity. 
Oh Mary, sweet little Mary. 
Do you actually believe that you can trust people? 
Yes, I do. 
 Really? 
Do you trust me? 
Of course I do. 
 And why not? 
You work with me. 
You see me every day. 
You know that I care about you. 
If you can't trust me, you can't trust anyone. 
Do you trust me? 
Huh? Huh? Huh? 
Dr. So.. ooh. 
The... police called. 
They have your mugger. 
They what? 
 They have your mugger. 
This is great! 
 You have to go down and identify him. 
Oh, no. 
You've got to confront him. 
 No, no! 
It's the only way to reassert control over your life. 
You'll feel better, believe me. 
Well, will you go with me? 
Yes, but give me a minute. 
There's one thing that I really have to do. 
Okay. Let's go. 
I'll get the car. 
You know, I'm real proud of you. 
For what, the way I slipped in and out of consciousness? 
No, for the way you were unashamed to show how non-athletic you are. 
Look, August, I've been thinking about this. 
I've been trying to do everything that you think that I should do, but it's just not working. 
And I'm sorry if this redefines the parameters of our relationship. 
But you're just going to have to accept me for who I am, regardless if I'm short or lousy at basketball or whatever! 
You know, I kind of like it when you're assertive like this. 
You do? 
 But not all the time. 
Oh. Well, how often do you 
think I should be assertive? 
Well, Tommy, if I told you that.. 
 Right, right. 
I'll figure it out, I'll figure it out. Is now a good time? 
Sure. 
Come on. 
 Okay. 
Okay, Mr. Solomon, it's 
time to finger your perp. 
Believe me, I've tried, but she just won't let me. 
No, we need you to I.D. Your assailant. 
Ohh oh well, I, I, I hope I can remember what he looks like. 
I didn't really get a good look at him. 
It was dark, and it happened so quick. 
You! 
You owe me $400! 
You.. 
That's a positive I.D. 
 Take his cuffs off! 
Take 'em off! 
I want a fair fight! 
Rusty. 
Oh, and by the way, mugger boy, your skin is not nearly as creamy as you'd like people to think! 
Dr. Albright, 
thank you. 
You were so right.. all I 
had to do was confront him. 
And beat him senseless? 
No, no, no, that was pure gravy. 
Oh. You know, 
we never had that dinner. 
Care to join me? 
Mmm, no, not tonight. 
I'm going to do something that I haven't done for quite awhile.. sleep. 
Of course, you're welcome to join me, if you like. 
I'll pass. 
Just being polite. 
So, Don, when are you going to torture him? 
No, no, he still has to go to trial. 
So then you'll torture him at the trial? 
We don't work that way. 
Everyone has equal rights. 
That's the law. 
Oh, Don, I thought I knew you, but we come from different worlds. 
No, we don't. 
You come from a place filled with laws and rights and fair trials. 
I come from a place where the wind blows cold and the only thing you can count on is that you can't count on anything. 
You're from Chicago? 
Good-bye, Don. 
It's too bad. 
We could've been great. 
Sally, you've got me all wrong. 
Uh, they brought me up on brutality charges. 
There's a video! 
I think we should transfer $500 from our money market account to our checking account. 
We don't have a money market account. 
Shh! It doesn't 
know that. 
I'm proud of us for coming out here tonight. 
Dr. Albright said 
a very wise thing. 
She said if you let fear drive you into hiding, then the criminals have won. 
Dick, there's someone behind us. 
What do they look like? 
75, female, very frail. 
  What do we do, lieutenant? 
Knock her down and run for the car. 
 What about the money? 
We don't have time. Go! 
These deodorants are a rip-off, they always run out by the time I get to my feet. 
Dick, the mail's here. 
Ooh, it's my package from the carousel Cd club. 
You infiltrated a club? 
 Good work, Harry! 
I got 10 CDs for one penny. 
All I've got to do is buy eight more at regular store prices which are often at or below retail store prices. 
Well, way to go. 
 Like taking candy from a baby. 
Such primitive technology. 
I wonder if the people on this planet will ever discover the superior sound of vinyl. 
What kind of music did you get? 
 I told them to surprise me. 
well, this is surprising. 
Uh... why am I 
doing this? 
Same reason I'm doing this, I suppose. 
This is very powerful. 
I'm feelin' funky This is not good. 
I can't stop! 
 Nobody panic. 
Let's get out of here! 
Enriched wheat flour, Butylated Hydroxyanisole, sodium acid pyrophosphate. 
Needs more Butylated Hydroxyanisole. 
Isn't this interesting? 
They opened up a hard rock cafe in Vietnam. 
The world has changed, huh? 
It sure has. 
Once it was completely covered with ice. 
The administration office called. 
They contacted Stanford about transferring your graduate records, but they don't seem to have them. 
Are you implying that I don't have records? 
All humans have records, and I'm a human. 
Therefore, I have records. 
I'm sorry, but Stanford says they have no record of you at all. 
Oh, those incompetents. 
Do I have to fly out to Denver and straighten this out myself? 
Stanford's in California, not Denver. 
Well, that explains it. They 
lost my records in the move. 
So you were at Stanford in the '60s. 
Ah, who wasn't? 
 I was at Berkeley. 
God, that takes me back. 
I remember I was at Stanford once to protest at.. 
there's only two things I know about the '60s: I wasn't born yet, and no one cares. Peace. 
I guess you had to be there. 
 Apparently so. 
It was fun though wasn't it? 
Out-of-control, mind-numbing, self-destructive fun. 
It sounds like a clich� but I actually remember burning my bra in front of the Lincoln reflecting pool. 
I hope you had the good sense to jump in and put yourself out. 
God, I was a rebel. 
You wouldn't believe it to look at me now, but back then I was a wild woman. 
If I wanted to do something, I just did it. 
Did you ever drop acid? 
 Oh, constantly. 
You did a lot of tripping? 
 That's how I dropped the acid. 
No, seriously, I want to know. 
Were you involved in any movements? 
 Well, uh, uh, this one. 
It's one of my favorites. 
Dr. Solomon, 
every time I ask you about your past, you change the subject. 
You know who keeps changing the subject all the time? My students. 
One of them is going to Alaska. How's your brother? 
Dick, I'm here. Let's go. 
 You heard him. Gotta go. 
You call your father Dick? 
 Yeah. 
When he was younger, I used to call him peanut. 
Have to run. See you 
tomorrow. Have a wonderful night. 
''What about Tommy'' ''He'Il miss you when you go'' ''Ma's on her own'' ''Karen's almost grown'' this is so sad. 
''Worried so''... 
country singers have really tough lives. 
''stay with Dad awhile'' Why? 
What's her complaint? 
She lives in a trailer. 
She could just roll away somewhere, and the Cd club would never find her. 
What are you talking about? 
Do you have any idea what's involved with this? 
The paperwork, the decisions. 
Why didn't I go with the cheese of the month club? 
No guesswork, just cheese. 
That was a fiasco. You're 
the information officer. 
How can you brief us on American history and leave out an entire decade? 
So I left out the '60s. 
So what? 
Exactly how far back did you establish our identities? 
Five or six... months. 
Your assignment was to provide full and complete histories for all of us. 
I had a book report due on "are you there, god? It's me, Margaret." 
Tommy, I'm not sure you understand the importance of this. 
Humans are creations of their past. 
Society, culture, even biology, demand that they carry around their past like baggage. 
And your lack of effort almost exposed the entire operation. 
Fine. So from now on, 
my homework comes last. 
Those are the house rules, mister. 
Hello! Hello! 
I found those books on the '60s. 
 Good, good. 
Never mind the bourbon stains. 
 Thank you, Mrs. D. 
Oh, the '60s. What a lovely, lovely decade. 
A lot of the stuff in this apartment is from the '60s. 
Boy, classic things never go out of style. 
Those long-haired freaks thought they were so cool. 
Let me tell you one thing. 
I was reading poetry with Jack Kerouac in a cage in 1956, both of us buck naked. 
Yes, well, thank you for that disturbing visual. 
I didn't hear Kerouac complain. 
Aw, "the electric kool-Aid acid test." 
Getting nostalgic? 
 Ah, yes, "those were the days, my friend." 
But you know, all this uproar, all this rhetoric, all this talk about mass movements what's happening here? 
History is made by the individual, not by the masses. 
Who said that? 
 I did. 
No, where is that from? 
 My mouth. 
No, somebody said that. 
Hello. 
That was me. 
This is so weird. 
Right on. 
 You've been rinsed and hung out to dry. 
Think about it. 
Dig it, babe. 
That's what's happening. 
History is made by the individual, not by the masses. 
Who said that? 
 I did. 
wow! 
 That's beautiful. 
What's the matter? 
 I couldn't put it together until now. 
It finally clicked.. 
the evasiveness, consistencies in your past. 
Dick Solomon is a false identity, isn't it? 
False identity? Me? 
You could have trusted me, you know. 
Well, I, I, I, I.. 
 There are so many people in the government who would love to get their hands on you. 
You can't let that happen. 
They'd parade me around like an animal. 
Don't worry. 
Your secret's safe with me, Manny. 
Manny Rosenberg. 
But I'm not Manny Rosenberg.. 
 Of course not, because Manny Rosenberg is still being hunted by the Fbi. 
For food or sport? 
So Manny Rosenberg was.. 
what? 
Manny Rosenberg was an act What? 
Excuse me. 
Okay, where was I? 
Manny Rosenberg was an activist involved in inciting a riot in 1971. 
Is there anything else? 
 I'm looking, I'm looking. 
All right, I found another box in the basement. 
What's "x-mas"? 
 I don't know, but it's got to be something psychedelic. Check this out. 
This is heavy. 
 Far out. 
My mind is blown. 
 Who is this? 
I think it's jerry Garcia. 
Look, here's a picture of Manny Rosenberg. 
He looks exactly like you. 
Oh, damn! 
I was supposed to get a completely original body. 
Those guys in research can't do anything right. 
What do you expect? 
They're non-union. 
This could really be trouble. 
Tommy, how are you coming along with our histories? 
I have them right here legal documents, school records, doctored pictures, the works. 
Dick Solomon, class nerd, held back by a domineering mother, went to work for Nasa in '74, but was fired after a minor procurement scandal. 
Newspaper clippings are enclosed. 
Major burnout led to a string of second-rate teaching jobs, yada, yada, yada, ending up here. 
 This is excellent. 
What about me? 
 Stockbroker during the greedy '80s. 
Made and lost several fortunes before psychological problems and gender confusion led to a sex change operation in 1988. 
I'm next. 
 Harry, you're adopted, but we haven't told you yet. 
Ohh, that's gonna hurt. 
Dr. Albright, 
I'm glad you're here. 
Good morning, Dr. Solomon. 
Yes, well, I'd like to clear up a few misunderstandings about yesterday. 
For some reason, you mistakenly think that I'm this Manny Rosenberg fellow. 
I brought in this documentation to prove.... 
Oh don't even bother. 
I told you you could trust me. 
You probably don't remember, but we've actually met before. 
You spoke at my campus in '69. 
Now, that's impossible. 
I was in the circus then. 
The flying solomoskis. 
There were six of us. 
Two of us plunged to our deaths. 
I don't expect you to remember me, what with all the people you've met. 
You're sitting on my desk. 
You've never done that before. 
Do you remember ever being at Berkeley, at a rally? 
You're not listening to me. I 
brought all this in to prove to you the stories you must have. 
 What? 
You know I'd be lying if I said I found this less than intriguing. 
Well, all those years underground, you do a lot of living. 
Harry? 
You got another package from the Cd club. 
I don't have time to listen to the ones I have. 
Those demons, they're not human. 
Neither are we. 
Well, yeah, but we have an excuse. Hello. 
I'm off to Dr. Albright's. 
She bought my phony profile, huh? 
 I don't even need it. 
She likes me much better, now that she thinks I'm Manny. 
Oh, great, so after all I went through creating a background for you? 
Do you realize I got you a weekend in Canc�n with twin gymnasts? 
All I got at the orphanage was a beating when I asked for more gruel. 
hello. 
 For you. 
You shouldn't have. 
I'm glad you came. 
And to think all this time I was just a desk away from danger. 
The thought of the F.B.I. 
watching us right now is such a turn-on. 
Yes. And even 
if I wasn't Manny, it would be just as exciting. 
Don't be silly. 
Are these... 
"magic" brownies? 
Pepperidge farm. 
You know, I think I have something. 
I found it when I moved eight years ago. It's in the freezer. 
It's a joint. 
Oh, a doobie. 
Let's Bogart that fat boy. 
You know what I regret? I 
never made it to Woodstock. 
Ah, yes, Woodstock, the three-day concert held on a farm in upstate new York that included many of the most popular music bands of the time, felt to be the culmination of the counterculture movement, captured by the song, " Woodstock," by Joni Mitchell. 
Found it! 
 The song was popularized by Crosby, stills & Nash, which is ironic since theirs was the more commercial version which is the antithesis of the spirit of the festival. 
Here we go. 
This isn't a joint. 
It's a frozen French fry. 
Oh, well, I guess we'll just settle for wine. 
You're an inspiration to all... 
neo-trotskyite anti-Stalinist Marxists. 
You know, you're pretty tuned in for a bourgeois chick. 
Meet me on the waterbed upstairs in five minutes. 
Oh, and, uh... 
lose the pins. 
What? 
Here's to... waterbeds. 
Okay..here's to... 
floor lamps. 
Hello. 
Carousel Cd club? 
I'll call back later. 
 Do not hang up that phone. 
You can do this, Harry. 
You can break free. 
You can take your mind back, or at least what's left of it. 
Okay, Sally, I will. 
Listen to me, buster. I'm not 
happy, and I want my money back. 
Very good. 
 I'm supposed to press "2" now. 
Yes. Hello? 
We need to talk. 
I'm at a place in my life where I'm just not ready for this kind of commitment. 
I think it's best that we break free, go our separate ways. 
You will? 
Oh, thanks! 
Hmm? 
Well... 
yes, I guess I do have a friend who might be interested. 
Her name is Sally Solomon. 
Oh! Oh, 
I can't believe we're doing this. 
Your hands are so small and delicate. 
I'm not positive, but I think I can fit your entire foot in my mouth. 
Oh! 
You are a superfreak. 
"The kind you don't take home to mother." 
Oh, Manny, Manny! 
Now I'm feeling a moral dilemma. 
I'm not sure I can go through with this. 
My bedroom's upstairs. 
Race ya. 
Oh, what the hell. 
What the hell...? 
 Don't be uptight, babe. 
Leave your hang-ups in suburbia. 
You're leaving? 
 You bet your bippy I am. 
hey! 
 You miserable creep! 
I don't understand. 
 Think about it. 
It's like you put a purple haze inside my brain. 
Give it a rest. 
What did I do wrong? 
 You know what you did. 
Come on, Manny. 
Berkeley..1969. 
Oh, you're mad at Manny. 
Yes, Dr. Albright 
is mad at Manny. 
Oh! Oh, Manny. 
It's okay because I have something to tell you that's going to straighten this whole thing out. 
I'm not Manny. 
Isn't that ironic? 
Right, you're not Manny. 
You just look exactly like him, know everything about his past, and have been carrying on this ridiculous charade for three days. 
You know me so well. 
Boy, I have been handed some lame stories in my life, but you take the cake. 
I don't want the cake. 
I want you. 
Oh, my god, you ARE Dick Solomon. 
And you let me make a complete fool of myself! 
How could you do that? 
I needed to tell you. 
I was going to tell you. 
What stopped you? 
 I thought you might sleep with me. 
Oh. 
Now I understand. 
 Oh, thank goodness. 
Get out! 
You selfish, inconsiderate, opportunistic bastard! 
You're right. 
I guess I'll be going. 
About inconsiderate, I did bring brownies. 
I sure am glad you won't be getting any more of these CDs in the mail. 
Yeah, and even if we do, there's no reason to think that I would have anything to do with it cause I didn't. 
Dick, someone's here to see you. 
I don't want to be seen. 
Tell them that I'm not here. 
He's not here, Dr. Albright, so go away. 
Mary! Mary! 
You've come back to me because you've forgiven me for what I've done and.. and because 
you realise that my deceit, although sophomoric, was meant as a pure gesture of affection. 
Well..some of that. 
Would you leave the two of us alone for a minute? 
Sure. 
Remember every word. 
We want all the details. 
Will do. 
Look, I.. I may 
have overreacted to this Manny thing. 
And I understand that men have a tendency to go overboard to impress me. I understand that. 
The only reason I pretended to be Manny is because you liked him so much more than me. 
Manny wasn't what he seemed, but you are exactly what you seem. 
And I'll admit that your lack of nuance is refreshing. 
Damn, I think I'm wearing Harry's underwear again. 
Well, a little nuance wouldn't hurt. 
So we're still friends? 
Peace.
