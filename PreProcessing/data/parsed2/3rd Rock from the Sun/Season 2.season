Oh Dick  Oh Mary We mustn't do this here. 
 Yes, we must do it. 
We can't! 
 We can. I measured. 
Oh! I have an early class tomorrow. 
You hear what she said, Dick? 
She's got an early class tomorrow. 
Will you be quiet? 
Can't you see I'm trying to get to second base here? 
Things have really changed since she entered the picture. 
Yeah, now we even have to act like humans when we're by ourselves. 
She's like that Yoko woman who ruined her husband's band. 
Oh, yeah. 
Hey you remember that episode where she convinced Ricky that she could play the bongos? 
This bites. 
So does she. 
What? 
The crust in your eyes, it's still there. 
Oh, no! no, don't touch it. 
It's beautiful. 
My god, you're a morning person. 
No. 
No, I'm a Mary person. 
Oh! Oh, that's 
so sweet. 
I had the strangest dream that your brother Harry was curled up at our feet in the middle of the night. 
It won't happen again. 
I'll finish dressing. 
 Can I help you? 
No. 
Do you mind? 
I am trying to sleep. 
She slept over again? 
 Slept? No. 
Well, eventually, but I think the innuendo is delightfully clear. 
Don't you see what's going on here? She hogs the bathroom. 
She leaves stuff in the sink for me to wash. 
And last night she forced us to watch an A and E biography on Susan Saint James. 
What's your point, lieutenant? 
 You let in an outsider. 
She's getting in the way of this mission. 
I'm giving you an opportunity to observe her up close. 
Well, she's no Jo Anne Worley, but, Quarters to her. 
Hello, Tommy. 
I really want the two of us to be friends. 
Don't you have any friends of your own? 
You're probably very confused about what's going on between your father and me. 
No, not really. 
I have excellent hearing. 
I just want you to know that your father and I are going to be seeing a lot more of each other. 
Oh, wow. 
How much could possibly be left? 
Well, gotta go. 
See you at the office. 
I have an idea. 
Why don't I ride with you? 
Ahh, I think it would be a better idea if we rode separately, if you know what I mean. 
I don't know what you mean. 
Well, People might start thinking that we're sleeping together. 
What?! 
 We are. 
We are, I swear. 
Why can't you two just ride together? 
I need the car to go shopping. 
 I need a ride downtown. 
It's just not a good idea. 
Why not? 
 This is exactly what I was talking about. 
She has a car... 
 It's really none of our business... 
You know what?! 
I don't want to start a fight here. 
I think it's okay for you to ride with me today. 
Yes! 
 Come on. 
What's this? 
I won. 
I won 150 dollars! 
You don't understand, lady. 
You owe "us" 150 dollars. 
Oh, I see. So you lure me 
down here to collect my prize. 
Then you pull the old bait and switch. 
I'll take care of this. 
Sally? 
Hello, Don. 
It's been a long time. 
I thought you walked out of my life for good. 
I'm back. I ran into 
trouble out there in the city. 
The city is full of trouble. 
I found this on my car. 
Parked in a handicap zone. 
I'm sure you had a good reason. 
Yes. It was the closest spot to the store. 
Works for me. 
Consider this taken care of. 
 Just like that? 
Just like that. 
Wow. 
Sally, can I take you out tonight? 
'Kay. 
No. Stop it. 
 We're not in the office. 
Behave yourself. 
 Let's go back in the car. 
No! 
Not in the car, not in the bar, not in the house, not up your blouse. 
I cannot touch you here or there. I cannot touch you anywhere. 
Judith! 
Father rice. 
Hello, Dr. Albright. 
 Dr. Solomon and I 
just ran into each other on the way in. 
Dr. Suter. 
What? 
I said, Dr. Suter! 
You again! 
Here, here, do you need any help? 
Get away from me. 
Good for you! 
Stay independent! 
Dick, rumor has it, that you and a certain anthropology professor are.. 
uh... going 
at it pretty good. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Yeah, right. 
I gotta get me an anvil. 
Harry, I need a ride. 
No. 
You know, I outrank you. 
Oh. Well, in that case, no, sir. 
Please? 
Just give me a ride. 
Look, come on. Can't you see that I'm busy? 
What, is it too much to ask for a little time for Harry? 
I'll tell you what. 
If the roadrunner wins this next one, you take me. 
But if he doesn't, I'll never ask you again. 
Okay, you're on. 
I've seen this next scheme before, and it's far too brilliant to fail twice. 
Let's go. 
you're wrong. 
 I'm right. 
You're wrong. 
 I'm not wrong. 
You're wrong about that, too. 
There's no way to observe a society without intruding. 
One can't help but leave footprints. 
Of course not. 
I've seen your bipedal gait. 
So let me get this straight. 
You're saying that you could drop right out of the sky into some strange culture and walk amongst them unnoticed? 
Yes! 
Hypothetically. 
Mary, you're an anthropologist, back me up. 
I'm afraid I'd have to agree with Dr. Solomon. 
Of course. 
What was I thinking? 
You're sleeping with him. 
This is a disaster, Dick. 
Everybody's talking about us. 
Oh, we're back to that again. 
You just don't understand. 
I've worked hard to be taken seriously. 
There was a time when I had a reputation. 
For excellence? 
Well, yes, but in a very specific category. 
When I was a young professor on the fast track, there were things that I did. 
Well what were you doing? 
The Dean. 
Is that like the Watusi? 
Sometimes. 
There was this very prestigious job opening. 
Did you get it? 
No, I didn't get the job, but I did get a nickname.. 
Dr. Mary Slutbunny. 
Well, there's your silver lining. 
You just don't get it, do you? 
When a man has an office romance, it doesn't affect his career. 
But when a woman has one, no one takes her seriously. 
I don't understand. 
I don't expect you to. 
I need to be alone tonight. 
But I'm not like that. 
I take you seriously, Dr. Slutbunny. 
Sally, you look beautiful. 
Oh, Don, that's just the doughnuts talking. 
What you did today was really powerful. 
I mean you just snapped your fingers and things fell into place. 
Let's just keep that our little secret, shall we? 
Okay. 
Would you like another doughnut? 
I don't know, are you sure you can afford it? 
I get 'em for free, all except the cream-filled, but all that will change when I make detective. 
That day will come, Don. 
We'll make it come. 
And then... 
we can eat cream-Filled.. 
together. 
One-David-niner. One-David-niner. Copy that. 
2-18? 
2-18. 
What is it? 
 It's a 218. 
I have to go. 
 Take me with you. 
I can't. 
 Please? 
Let's ride. 
 Oh, goody! 
That was so exhilarating, Don. 
I've never been on a raid before. 
Come to think of it, I've never held a criminal off the roof of a warehouse by his ankles until he screamed, "mommy"! 
Oh, mommy. 
Sally, you make me feel alive, like I've dropped a stun gun down my pants. 
Hey, Don, do it again. 
Sally, you're insatiable. 
You're home awfully late. 
I had a great time tonight. 
Dick, I think I've finally found my calling. 
What? 
I'm joining the police force. 
Why? 
Because I can make a difference. 
I'm sorry, lieutenant, but I forbid it. 
Why? 
Because you will make a difference. 
Say you clean up Rutherford. What's next? 
Cleveland. 
 Exactly. 
Then you clean up Ohio. 
 That's the plan. 
Soon, the entire Midwest is crime-free. 
What's going to happen to all those people whose income depends on crime? 
The lawyers, the insurance companies, the 11:00 news? 
Hell, the entire fox network? 
There are worldwide implications here. 
We're not supposed to interfere with life on this planet. 
Why can't I interfere with the planet? You do. 
I do not! 
What do you call what you're doing with Dr. Albright? 
That's different. 
When you're in love with someone, you're allowed to completely screw up their life. 
That's what love is. 
I understand. 
I'll talk to Don. 
Thank you, lieutenant. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to bed. 
I can't be around you with a nightstick right now. 
Yes, I seem to have that effect on women. 
Hey. 
Would you please take it outside? 
If only I could be that spoon. 
 Stop it. 
You let me be the spoon yesterday. 
Cut it out. 
 Come on! 
Dick, we're professionals. 
We have reputations to protect. 
We're not kids anymore. 
Oh, I see. 
The looser the skin, the tighter the behavior. 
Is that it? 
Just let me be the spoon once. Please? 
Fine. Just this once. 
You're about a quart low. 
From now on, I'm just going to slide things under the door. 
The two of you haven't RSVP'd the trustees' cocktail reception tomorrow night. 
Well, I can't speak for Dr. Solomon, 
but I'll be there. 
Nina, can I ask you something? 
Damn! I almost made it. 
There's a man and a woman, and the woman won't let the man near her in public. 
The man is very frustrated. What should he do 
when all he wants is climb to the top of the engineering tower and proclaim his love for all the campus to hear? 
Well I wouldn't do that if I were him. 
Well why not? 
Because Dr. Albright 
would kill him dead. 
Fine. 
I won't. 
I don't know what came over her. 
Same old story. 
She wants more space. 
I don't know how to give it to her.. 
Wait...I've got it. 
I'll go out and buy two dozen roses, and then I'll put a little note on each rose that says, "hope you're enjoying your space". 
Then I'll take one over every hour on the hour and give it to her. 
If she's not there, I'll leave it on her doorstep. 
No Dick, that doesn't sound like a very good idea. 
Look, do you want her back, or do you want her to think you're an idiot? 
I want her back. 
Well, you've got to play it cool. 
You have to act like you couldn't care less whether she likes you or not. 
But I do. 
No, you don't. 
Yes, I do! 
No, you don't. 
Oh, right. 
Maybe I don't. 
There you go. 
But I do! 
 No! 
Trust me, she'll come crawling back. 
I know what I'm talking about. 
I've been married five times. 
Yeah, Women. 
Or so I've heard. 
I understand, Mrs. Bittenson. 
His tree is dropping fruit on your property. 
It's just that the police department can't do anything at this time except dispatch three black-And-whites asap to that dirtbag's house and gas him until he picks up every last one of those... 
figs. 
I'm sorry, Sally. You just 
walked into a hornet's nest here. 
You work so hard, officer Don. 
Rusty, Rico. 
Protect and serve. 
That's what I do.. 
protect and serve. 
I got something to tell you, and it's going to hurt. 
Then make it quick. 
I can't join the force. 
But you're so good. 
I'm the best, but it's too much power for one person to have. 
I'd affect too many lives. 
No, there's no power. 
I do nothing. I'm completely ineffectual. 
Here's your stick. 
I'll never forget you, Smokey. 
You'll be back. 
A woman like you can't stay away. 
Maybe. 
Be careful out there. 
So are we sending the squad cars to collect those figs? 
Um... no, no. 
I'll just, um... 
pick 'em up on my way home. 
Oh, my god. 
Here he comes. 
They're going to have a field day with this one. 
It's okayDr Albright Just. Calm down. 
Nina! 
It's so good to see you, and only you. 
Oh, Dr. Solomon, 
I've never seen you with a turtleneck before. 
His name is Harry. 
Dr. Suter! 
Oh, and Mrs. Sumner! 
You look lovely this evening. 
Oh, well, thank.. 
no! 
Mmm! This is great dip, Mrs. Sumner. 
It's p�t�. 
This is great dip p�t�. 
What's she doing? 
You don't care. 
Oh... right. 
Dick, is there something.. 
Martini, dry. Not too dry. Moist, very moist. 
I see. 
You're punishing me. 
Fine. 
You're good. 
 Smooth. 
But it's so hard. 
Stay strong big guy. 
Trouble in paradise, Mary? 
Oh, shut up. 
Don't you have anything better to do? 
Why don't you get a life so I'll have somebody to talk about? 
Ouch. 
Oh, I love these things. 
 May I? 
This isn't metric, is it? 
I didn't know you played. 
 No, I'm not playing, I'm adding. 
Not the way I would have done it. 
Whatever. 
I'll never understand this human obsession with what other people think. 
I don't care what anybody thinks. 
You know, Harry, maybe you should care just a little. 
Sally, how did you leave it with officer Don? 
Open. I've never been 
out with a guy like him. 
I've been wined and dined, but I've never been doughnut-ed. 
I like it. 
I'd like to be breaded and deep fried. 
And I don't care what anybody thinks of it. 
You're right Harry. The only voice that 
matters is the one inside your head. 
Ha! Which one? 
Shut up. 
Mary Albright is mine! 
Dick Solomon is mine! 
You on the roof, put down the bullhorn! 
There have been complaints. 
Put down the bullhorn! 
Thanks, Don. 
So I said to her, "hey mom your birthday was last month, hoist it up yourself". 
I don't get it, what are they laughing at? 
Anyway, I'm not saying my mom is overweight, she's got that flabby skin under her arm. 
You know what I'm talking about. 
Well, the other day this wind picks up, this stuff starts jiggling out dropped a tricycle I lost when I was seven. 
Excuse me. 
Perhaps you can help me out. Those 
things you said about your mother, I don't understand why they're considered funny. 
Well, um.. 
 Is it because the toned arms that once cradled you securely now have large deposits of cellulite hanging from them? 
Is aging funny? 
 If you think about it.. 
And you, is it all the alcohol you're consuming that makes it okay to laugh at the expense of your loved ones? 
He's right! 
I love my fat mama! 
And you're a bad man! 
Dr. Albright, 
have you ever lost a tricycle in your mother? 
Please Dick, I am in a cruddy mood. 
This fundraiser is turning out to be a nightmare. 
Well, why are you laughing? You 
just said you were in a cruddy mood. 
Oh, it's these jokes Ben Littmeyer gave me at lunch. 
Ben Littmeyer, from the sociology department? 
Yes, oh he has the best sense of humour. 
I finally convinced him to host the fundraiser. 
Well, why didn't you ask me to do it? 
I have a wonderful sense of humour. 
Nina, come in here. 
I have a wonderful sense of humour, don't I? 
Ohhh. 
See? 
 Oh! 
This is an important fundraiser for Pendleton, and Ben can get those fat cats to cough up some cash. 
Well I can make a fat cat cough. 
I can even make him vomit. 
Thanks Dick, but Ben already said yes. 
You don't think I'm funny? 
Oh Dick, you're loving, and intelligent, and sexy.. 
and funny? 
 Oh! I have a class! 
I am funny! I am funny! 
I am! 
What happened to your coat? 
I don't know what happened to it, so Mrs. Dubcek let me 
borrow this one. 
Sweet woman. 
So you lost your coat? 
Oh tough break. 
I lost more than a coat, Tommy! 
I lost a friend, a buddy, a companion, who kept me warm when it was cold and warmer when it was really sort of too hot to be wearing a coat. 
Tommy, look, you're the information officer. 
What do you know about this thing they call a sense of humour? 
All I know is, that's not it. 
Lieutenant, I need your help. 
I need you to find out what's funny. 
Oh I can't, I've got to build this.. 
I ran out of room for my shoes. 
Well this is more important, it's about me! 
Well how am I supposed to know what's funny? 
What's so important about a sense of humour anyway? 
Oh come on Tommy. 
Having a sense of humor is having the power, to transform someone's mood, to lift his spirit. 
You give it to someone you love when she really needs it. 
And I just found out today, that Marys been getting it from another man. 
Dick, I think this whole being funny thing is just innate. 
What do you think, lieutenant? 
 What do I think? 
I think either you got it or you don't. 
Look what you just did! 
What's wrong with you guys? 
Come on! Wake up you two, come on! 
How am I ever gonna find out what's funny? 
No I don't get it. Give me 
an example of what's funny. 
Okay let's see. 
I thought the movie Emma was really funny. 
What was funny about it? 
Didn't you get it? 
It was full of irony. 
Okay, so irony's funny. 
Sure, because someone says something, and the opposite is actually true. 
Oh okay, like when you told me Emma was gonna be a really great movie, when actually it sucked out loud? 
Well, apparently, irony is a little too sophisticated for you. 
Either that or you don't know what's funny either. 
I... don't know 
what's funny? 
I'll have you know, at camp, I was voted "Miss Whimsy". 
Why, was Miss Irony killed in a canoe accident? 
Hi, Dick. 
 Oh, uh, Mary. 
Just doing some reading. 
Some physics reading, you know. 
Okay. 
Say, uh, an amusing joke just came to me you know, out of the blue. 
Knock, knock. 
Okay. 
Who's there? 
Who's there you say? 
Nina! 
Nina who? 
Ah Nina, she's right here! 
Please let me host that fundraiser! 
No! 
 Oh! 
Ben Littmeyer just called, he's gonna be a few minutes late for lunch. 
Oh, another lunch with Ben. 
I see. 
How funny for you. 
Well, would you like to join us, we could make it a threesome? 
I don't go that way Mary. 
Fine! 
And last but not least, garlic gum. 
Oh, uh, Harry, how would you like a nice piece of perfectly ordinary gum? 
Okay. 
Mmm, garlicky. 
Well, I had a great day. 
I haven't learned a thing about comedy, and August and I had a huge fight. 
Oh well, how would you like a nice doughnut? 
from this bag labeled "donuts". 
Ahh! You touched doggy doody! 
Since when is doggy doody made in Taiwan? 
They have dogs in Taiwan.. big ones. 
Funny, right? 
 I don't know. You know, 
I don't think I'm ever gonna see my coat again. 
Okay, Harry, why don't you sit down, you'll feel a lot better? 
Right here. 
Excuse me. 
Damn! 
You know, at least I can take comfort in knowing that I treated my coat well. 
Such as yesterday. 
It was hot on the bus. 
I took it off and folded it neatly and placed it under the shade of my seat. 
What? 
You left it on the bus. 
No-o-o! 
You know they have a lost and found Harry. 
Oh you mean I might see my coat again? 
Oh I am so happy. 
Dick, I've been thinking about this "humour" thing. 
Why don't you try what those guys on TV do? 
Everybody says they're funny? 
 Oh, yeah, those guys! 
You know.. 
The McLaughlin group? 
No. 
They're not funny at all! 
Oh, hello Dick. 
 Hello Ben. 
I'm waiting for Mary. 
I'm sleeping with Mary. 
Oh. Okay. 
So from what I've heard, you're quite the professor funnypants. 
Well, I.. 
 It's seems that you have Mary wrapped around your little funny bone. 
But I can assure you, I am a far tougher... 
bone wrapperer I think I'll wait outside. 
Make me laugh funny man. 
Well, I'm not a comedian. 
It's just that funny things, just seem to happen to me. 
Oh really, like what? 
Well, like last week, I was at a bus stop, and it suddenly started raining, pouring. 
And I look over and I see this gorgeous grad student, and she's looking at me, like a kid with braces, looking at a candy apple. 
Mmm, no, not funny. 
Well, I'm about to say hello, when I suddenly realize, that my hair has flipped forward. 
Here I am standing in the rain, with my very own awning. 
Well, finally the bus arrived, and the door opened, the compressor kicked in, and this, this, European weave of mine got sucked right into the bus! 
Well, there I was, in front of this beautiful girl, and chasing that bus, and chasing my hair.. 
up and down, chasing! 
And I couldn't..I just.. oh! 
Oh! Oh! 
This is not good. 
Yes, Yes, it is! 
The bus stole your hair! 
Call 911! 
911! 
Mary was so right about you Ben! 
What's going on? 
Ben's been telling me the funniest story, about the bus, and the girl, and the.. 
Call 911! 
You've heard this one before! 
I'm telling you, Ben's heart stopping temporarily was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
He's getting some much-needed bed rest, and I'm emceeing the fundraiser tomorrow night. 
How did you manage that? 
I promised Dr. Albright 
I'd stick to Ben's script. 
Are you gonna? 
 No. 
All right, next up on open mike night, very funny man, put your hands together for Dick Solomon. 
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
Thanks a lot! 
Thank you so much! 
Now, I'm gonna tell you some jokes. 
Joke one: I went fishing last week. 
My permit said I could only catch five. 
Oh, I caught five, all right, as in 35. 
Was that funny? 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
But you know.. 
pot-stickers, what are they all about? 
Haa-haa! 
Okay, joke number two: Some termites.. 
I mean, huge termites.. 
ate my house last night. 
Uh, it's gone. 
It's completely gone. 
That's it. 
That's the joke. 
Really suck. 
 Really. 
Where are you going? Wait. 
Wait. Where are you going? 
Hey, look! A bald guy. Am I right? 
Haa-haa! 
So, who do you think's funny in our class? 
Um, Alan Gimball. 
Alan Gimball? Why? 
 'Cause he's 20. 
Oh, so.. so you think 
dumb people are funny? 
If they're that dumb, yeah. 
You know who I think is funny? 
David Barrett. 
Oh, yeah, he's hysterical. 
 He is so clever. 
I meant because he looks like a big dork. 
What? 
All right, let's install this baby. 
 Sweet! 
Did you measure the shelves? 
 Yes. 
Did you measure the closet? 
 Yes. 
Did you measure the door? 
 Damn! 
Listen, if it's storage you're after, you can put it in the hall closet downstairs. 
Let me go and get the door for you. 
All right,here, keep it sideways. 
Uh, Dubcek, hold it. 
 What? 
I got it, I got it, no problem, no problem Hello? Yeah just a second. 
Harry, for you. 
Hello. 
Wrong number. 
She took it down herself. 
Ah, it's all right. 
You had the guts to get up there, you know? It takes time. 
I have to be funny by tomorrow night! 
You're not gonna make it. 
I don't know what to do! 
Well, don't over-think it, you know, just, talk about things you know. That's what I do. 
Yeah. You make fun of 
your poor mother's flabby arms. 
Hey, those flabby-arm jokes made her the most popular senior in Fort Meyers, Florida. 
You.. you mean, 
she doesn't hate you for it? 
Hate me? No. 
She loves me for it. 
It's a joke. 
You mean, tricycles don't really fall out of her arms? 
Uh, no. 
Oh my god! 
Of course they don't! 
I mean, just think how flabby her arms would have to be for a tricycle to be up in there, and for so many years. 
And she didn't even notice it, not even when she took a shower. 
That's hysterical. 
I get it. 
I get the joke! 
Thank you! 
Thank you so much! 
This should be fun. 
Um, I'd like to welcome you all here tonight. 
Before we go any further, I think that we should all acknowledge the sensational job, that my esteemed colleague, Dr. Mary Albright has done 
in organizing this truly worthwhile event. Dr. Albright. 
Don't you love Dr. Albright? 
I know I do. 
Now, I know many of you are wondering, what's with her long sleeves? 
Well, I'll tell you. 
It's to cover up her flabby arms. 
She shook them the other day, and the dead sea scrolls fell out. 
She's, uh.. she's quite old also, you see. 
But you know, as sweet and wonderful, as Dr. Albright is, 
she can also be somewhat domineering, power-hungry and hostile, and I think I finally figured out why. 
Dr. Albright, 
while you may not have a man's genitalia, at least you have his razor stubble. 
Oh, oh, oh! Oh! 
And there's Nina. 
Nina is Dr. Albright's 
assistant. 
Nina, stand up, stand up. 
Come on, stand up. 
Show everybody how you put the "Ass" in "Assistant". 
I left my coat on the bus. 
 Can you describe it? 
Yes, it had eight wheels, hard plastic seats, and when it stopped, it went, "sh-h-h-h" Harry, he means the coat. 
 Oh, oh! 
Um, well, it kind of looked like this one, only it was furry.. 
don't have it. 
Next. 
Night Eddie. 
 See you Monday. 
He's got my coat. 
 Harry, be a man. 
Hey, Mister, that's my coat. 
No it isn't. 
 Yeah, that's his coat. 
If it's his coat, how come I'm wearing it? 
Good point. 
Hey babes. 
Good morning Dick, did you sleep well? 
Once the adrenaline wore off, like a baby. 
You know when you've been riding the bullet train to "yuk-ville", it's kind of hard to slow down. 
I've been up all night faxing jokes to Leno. 
What have we here? 
Eleven banana cream pies! 
One for every letter in my name. Am I right? 
Right. 
Oh girls. You shouldn't have. 
Oh, we had to. 
Really. 
You were so funny last night. 
 Ohh. 
I was wondering if you could help us out? 
Oh I'd be delighted to share my... 
comedic expertise. 
We who are clowns are known for our generosity. 
Maybe you can help us settle an argument we were having. 
Shoot. 
What's funnier? 
This... 
or this? 
Or... is two 
at once funny? 
How about... 
this? 
Is this funny? 
I think... 
this. 
You are so right! 
That is funny! 
Thank you so much for helping us. 
I'm glad I could be of service. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach. 
You know, it's a remarkable feeling to be able to make someone else laugh. 
It's almost as if you have the power to get inside their brain, and tickle it. 
I can do that with a chopstick. 
Imagine how different war would be, if instead of trying to kill each other, people just showed up armed with jokes. 
But you could still have guns, right? 
Because, you know, eventually you'd stop laughing, and want to get on with the killing. 
You know what I found out? 
Humour's subjective. 
What do you mean? 
Well, I thought the fact that no one was laughing at you at the comedy club was hysterical. 
Oh, I loved that. 
No no. 
No, that wasn't funny. 
See? 
 Which is also ironic. 
You were at a comedy club, and no one was laughing. 
Hey shut up all of you! 
Well I think I'm gonna take my furry little friend for a walk. 
He's been locked in the basement all week. 
You know, why do they call it a "fur coat" anyway? 
It's not made of fur, and it's not a coat. 
Uh, actually Harry, it's both those things. 
It was a joke. 
Ohh! 
Good night everybody. 
High Commander's log. 
Make that "former" high commander. 
I am writing this so that future generations will know the truth. 
It all began two days ago. 
Okay, where's my shoes? 
Oh well I think I saw one of them right over there. 
Harry received a message from the big giant head saying that I was to be replaced the very next night. 
Cruelly, that was the very night that Mary finally said, "I care about you". 
Mary, you understand my every thought. 
I understand. You've had 
the milk. Why buy the cow? 
No, I want you. 
I want the cow. 
But I was summoned into the basement to meet my replacement. 
And here I am in this encasement. 
No. 
I must make an erasement. 
Ignoring all military protocol, he confined me in this invisible box. 
Oh, my god! 
He's turned me into a mime! 
What's going on in that pan? 
 I'm cooking sausages. 
Those are links. 
I like patties. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
 Sorry won't do. 
Press that meat, soldier. 
I like my links flat. 
Who ate my Strawberries? 
What Strawberries? 
 I had a pint of Strawberries in here with a note clearly marked mine. 
I didn't take 'em. 
 It wasn't me. 
Man, them strawberries was good eating. 
It is becoming all too clear how my predecessor chose to run things. 
You will find things to be quite different under my command, Tommy. 
Uh, no, I'm Harry. 
No, I've decided that from now on you will be known as Tommy. 
What about me? 
You will be known as Tommy, too. 
But wait. Tommy and then the 
number 2, or Tommy as well? 
You will all be known as Tommy! 
And that's not all. Lieutenant? 
 Sir! 
From now on, you will wear skirts. 
 Skirts? 
Something long that looks pretty when you twirl. 
And stay away from pleats. 
You know, nothing too fussy. 
Okay. 
Furthermore, when coupons arrive in the mail, I get first dibs. 
I may open a box of cereal to get the prize, but I do not then have to eat... 
the cereal. 
The bathroom has been stocked with two kinds of toilet paper. 
I, and I alone, get the quilted kind. 
You will go to a barber. 
I will go to a stylist. 
But wait, wait, wait. We have 
so much more hair than you do. 
You will never mention that again! 
Have I made myself clear, Tommy? 
yes. 
When someone asks you what time it is, you do not say "it's time to die". 
And, uh, where do I go for work? 
 The university. 
Ah. So I run 
the university. 
Not so much run. 
You teach a physics class. 
I'm a teacher?! 
Were all the janitors' jobs taken? 
Six months on this planet, and that's all my predecessor achieved. 
How pitiful. 
He was spending a lot of time on that whole Dr. Albright thing. 
Ah, yes, Mary. 
I've got plans for her. 
There's my girl. 
I feel so pretty. 
Now pay attention. I 
have an assignment for you. 
Lieutenant, take this down. 
I will require the following items: 500 rolls of silver reflective duct tape, 144 ceramic custard cups, one subatomic spectrometer, and one turkey baster. 
You see, I am building the greatest incubator these puny humans have ever known. 
And when it is completed, I will spawn my own private army of... 
of... 
fuzzy easter chicks. 
What are you looking at? You 
have your assignment. Hop to it! 
Can you give us a ride? 
 No. The car is mine, and mine alone. 
You're humans. 
Use your feet. 
You know, I was this close to kicking his butt. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I was gonna kick his butt, but, you know, I figured you'd do it. 
Well, when he comes back, I'm kicking his butt. 
 All right. 
What are you guys complaining about, huh? 
I deserved his job. I 
should be high commander. 
I have the seniority. 
I know the territory. 
So why wasn't I promoted, huh? 
Because I'm the woman. 
Once again, the woman was passed over. 
You want me to kick his butt? 
 Harry, there's not going to be any butt-Kicking. He is high commander. 
Like it or not, we're sworn to follow him. 
Anyway, maybe this mission could use a little discipline. 
Yeah, nice skirt, Tommy. 
All right, how do you work a car? 
See, it's the difference between good fabric and cheap fabric. 
Then again, my third husband liked 'em cheap. 
Yes, yes, that's fascinating. 
Say, Dr. Solomon, 
could you come over and give me a hand with my lint trap? 
No, I... 
I'd love to really, but I'm afraid it's impossible. 
You see, I have a bad back. 
I think I know why you're down here. 
Same reason my second husband used to come down here. 
Bottle of scotch hidden in the insulation. 
Of course, I always knew. 
The pink fuzz in his beer gave him away. 
Mrs. Dubcek. 
 Mmhmm. 
Yes? 
I need you to do me a favour. 
Could you go upstairs and tell Sally that I'm down here? 
But if you see me standing there.. 
and this is very important.. 
don't say anything to me. 
Just take Sally aside and whisper it to her. 
Whatever you do, make sure "I" don't hear "you". 
Come again? 
Never mind. 
Stop it. 
Okay, here's the duct tape. How much do we need? 
500 rolls, silver reflective. 
Okay, well, how about eight rolls of sort of grayish? 
 That's fine. 
What do you think Dick's doing now? You know, old Dick. 
You don't think they reassigned him to the brown planet, do you? 
Ooh... 
Dennis! 
 Tom, Sally, Harry. 
What are you guys doing here? 
We just had to pick up some duct tape here. 
No, I mean, on Earth. 
Oh. Well, we're 
doing that thing where we're supposed to be a human family. 
I dodged that assignment. 
We've seen you on TV. 
18 rebounds a game. 
Don't people suspect anything? 
Look at you.. 
the hair, the tattoos. 
Like you could be human. 
They think I'm weird or something. 
I hear that. 
Listen, Dennis, I gotta ask you. 
Madonna.. 
where is she from? 
Detroit. 
 Detroit, earth? 
Nooooo! 
Yeah, she's here. 
She's here. 
What about Michael Jordan? 
 Robot. 
I told you so. See? 
 All right, all right. 
Well, guys, I gotta be going. 
Proceed boldly and with stealth. 
Jam on. 
I like what you've done with your desk. 
Would you like me to do it to yours? 
No. 
I like it messy. 
Bad girl. 
So, Dr. Albright, 
refresh my memory. 
Have you and I... 
had sex yet? 
Why, yes, I believe we have. 
How was it? 
It was... nice. 
Next time, it won't be... so nice. 
What did you do to him? 
 I don't know, Nina. 
Nina, where's that comprehensive course syllabus? 
You only asked me to do it 10 minutes ago. I'm not a machine. 
Oh, pity. 
What are you doing? Trying 
to show off in front of her? 
I don't have to show off. 
I just have to... 
show up. 
Isn't he naughty? 
Old Dick would have never ordered us out onto the roof. 
Except for that one time he ordered us out onto the roof. 
Oh, well, that time, sure. 
A small fire has broken out in the living room. 
There's a fire extinguisher next to the stove. 
The stove is in the kitchen. 
Obviously. 
This guy's such a hard-ass. 
May I remind you that that hard-Ass is our high commander? 
You're the weapons expert. 
Isn't there some way to get rid of him? 
No, we're stuck with him. 
We can't just frag him with a grenade while he's taking a shower. 
But listen, showers accidentally explode all the time. 
I didn't hear that, soldier. 
He said that showers.. 
Shut up! 
Thank you very much. The fire 
extinguisher is now on fire. 
I miss the old Dick. 
 I miss the old Dick, too. 
Well, missing him's not going to bring him back. 
I will admit that the old Dick's methods were a little different than this Dick, but.. 
it's not up to us to question his directives, okay, He is in command, and that's that. 
He's... 
he's just mean, and there's nothing we can do about it. 
Whoa, whoa. 
You're getting all wet. Stop. 
 Stop leaking. 
No, you're right. 
As Dick always used to say, never let 'em see you leak. 
The fire's out of control. 
I'll be back in two hours. 
I miss Dick. 
What do you want? 
What do you want?! 
Stop it. 
Stop it! 
Hello. 
Dr. Albright, dinner, my place, tonight. 
Is that an invitation? 
 No. 
Well... 
the cat thinks he has the mouse by the tail. 
Yes, but sometimes the cat likes to... 
play with his prey before he goes in for the kill. 
Well, the cat may have claws, but the mouse is quick. 
True, but the mouse will always fall for the cheese. 
The cat likes a little cheese, too. 
And milk, and dead birds... 
but he always licks himself clean. 
You were asking me to dinner? 
Uh, yes. 
 I'll be there. 
No, I'm the cat! 
Here's the syllabus that you wanted. 
Why, this is beautiful, Nina. 
So... 
exquisitely beautiful. 
Well, we got a new toner cartridge.. 
don't be so modest. 
I'll see you later. 
All right. 
Excuse me. There must be some mistake. 
This classroom is mine. 
Find your own. 
Dr. Solomon, we were all 
just waiting for our grades. 
Oh, grades. 
I didn't realize teaching involved evaluation. 
Very well. 
You need your hair straightened. 
You're too short for your face. 
You have a museum-quality torso. 
You... are harmless. 
You will be spared and used to carry and used to carry heavy things. 
You.. 
 Dr. Solomon, we meant our letter grades. 
I've decided to give you all... 
"d"s. 
 We got "d"s. 
Isn't this beautiful? 
I mean, look at her, reunited with the birth mother she never knew. 
I love "Ricki lake". 
The other day, this woman finally came face-to-face with her stalker. 
And he was so sweet, she agreed to go out on a date with him. 
Well, maybe if I went on that show, they would reunite me with Dick.. 
Johnson. 
Dick Johnson. 
Little Dickie Johnson. 
Stop looking at me. 
And who is this exquisite creature? 
Uh... maybe you'd better 
go downstairs, Mrs. Dubcek. 
Mrs. Dubcek. 
I will see you later, Mrs. Dubcek. 
Turn that rubbish off. 
From now on, we watch only golf. 
But I was going to watch "the jerry springer show". 
Transmission incoming from the big giant head. 
Warning, warning! 
Danger, danger! 
Due to a clerical error, your high commander may have been accidentally replaced by a disgruntled former employee of the big giant head. 
He should be considered armed and extremely unpleasant. 
And remember, when you're thinking of giant heads, think of the big giant head. 
Resume normal functions in three, two, one. 
All right, what was it? 
Wrong number. 
 Oh. 
Now shut up and get me that turkey baster! 
Why don't you make me get the turkey baster? 
Hi, old Dick. 
Dick! 
 Harry! 
Invisible box? 
 Yeah. 
Yes? 
 What is the meaning of this? 
I distinctly asked for reflective duct tape. 
Oh, about that, see, that was all they had. 
Typical. Did you get 
the custard cups? 
We didn't so much get them, as failed.. 
to get them, sir. 
Did you try jenny's restaurant supply on fifth street? 
They're not open to the general public. 
 Oh. 
That's right. Can't let 
just anyone make custard. 
No, of course not, not on this planet, No, no, that would be too simple. 
No, we have retail, and we have wholesale. 
We have pink packets and blue packets, republicans and democrats, and the party that crazy midget started. 
So many choices. 
How they all love their free will. 
Everybody has a different point of view. 
There should be only one point of view.. 
my point of view. 
Well, I have a message for these humans. 
The buffet is about to close.. 
forever. 
What is it, boy? 
I think he wants us to follow him. 
Dick! 
 Dick! 
Sally! No, look out! 
There's an invisible.. 
oh, you guys, there's an invisible box. 
44 across, "men are from Mars, women are from..." 
let's see, five letters starting with V. 
Ah! "Vegas". 
Dick! Dick, look who 
I met outside.. Michel. 
Michelle? 
You're a girl? 
No, he's from France. 
 Hello. 
Michel asked me to take a picture of him standing next to that statue of general Rufus Putnam. 
Oh did you make him put his finger in the general's nose? 
Oui. 
"Oui." 
That means yes. 
Mary! Nina! 
This is Sally's delightful new French guy, Michel. 
Ah. Mary, Nina. 
Your names could be French. 
I took three years of French in high school and I can't remember a thing. 
No no no, I am in America, I am the one who needs to learn, hmm? 
Okay. 
Oh! Michel, how do you say " 
nice to meet you" in French? 
Enchant�. 
 Enchant�. 
Okay, how do you say, five, five, five, o, one, eight, nine? 
Cinq, cinq, cinq, z�ro, Un, huit, neuf. 
Okay, you might want to write that down. 
Nina! 
Michel, we should be going. 
Yeah, it was fantastic to meet you all. 
Oh, yeah. Oh. 
He is so charming. 
Ow! Oui! 
On my foot I have a big, painful, oozing blister. 
A blister! 
So Michel, what time is it in France right now? 
Uh... 4:00 A.M. 
Wow, it's so early. 
You have been so wonderful to me, Sally. 
I never meet a woman like you. 
And you never will again. 
You are not only beautiful, you are kind.. 
but more beautiful right? 
 Yes. 
So, um, how long are you planning on staying in Rutherford? 
Sally, I.. I love this place, 
I would like to stay very much, but your government is... not so nice. 
Except for Abraham Lincoln. 
Yes, nice man, very very nice man. 
But... 
your country is not safe for someone like me. 
Uh... there is only one 
safe way for me to stay here, kind girl. 
I need to get married. 
Sally? 
Would you marry me? 
Yeow! Damn! 
Hot diggity dog!, 
Oh man, oh man, oh mama! 
It's just that... nobody 
has ever asked me that before. 
Oui. 
 Oh! 
You're what?! 
 I'm getting married. 
Why are you doing this? 
Two reasons, I'm a woman, and he asked me. 
Lieutenant, aren't you forgetting something? 
You're right, the wedding announcement! 
No no! The mission. 
Dick, this is my mission. It's 
what women are supposed to do, get married, have babies, hire total strangers to raise them, and then wonder where they went wrong. 
Very true. 
It happened so quickly. How 
did he know it was time to ask? 
He's a man, men know these things. 
But I'm a man. 
Am I missing something? 
You? Never. 
 No flies on you. 
Dick, trust me, I know what I'm doing. 
Besides, I've dated more than any of you. 
But by no stretch of the imagination have you been the most promiscuous. 
Trust me, high commander, Michel's a great guy. 
Plus he's loaded, look. 
He's giving me $5,000, he wants to marry me so badly. 
2,000 upfront and the rest when the deal's done. 
As a gift? 
 No no, Tommy... 
this is what's known as a dowry. 
It's an old-world marriage custom and Michel is from there. 
Maybe if we hold out, he'll throw in a goat or two. 
And the best part of everything is I get to have a wedding, you know? 
Big white dress, long veil, crappy band. 
Ah. It will be a day 
I'll always remember. 
Okay, there's work to be done! 
Harry, I want you to find me something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, go! 
Tommy! Get me a deal on flowers! 
 Flowers! 
Dick! Your job is to sit back, 
and just get overwhelmed by the whole process, okay? 
Hi, can I help you with something? 
Yeah, my sister is getting married, she needs flowers. 
Ah, anything in mind? 
 Cheap. 
Ah. You know what? 
I have a sample bouquet from a wedding we did yesterday. 
Something like this maybe? 
Yeah yeah, that's nice, but it doesn't really uh... 
pop, you know what I'm saying? 
I was thinking something maybe a little more like this, and maybe a spray of these.. 
oh, these are great. 
Could you hand me the ribbon back there? 
No, the ivory. 
Let's see. 
Now this rocks. 
Young man, you have quite a knack for this. 
Flowers eh? Cool. 
She's getting married. 
 Oh, that's so romantic! 
She just met him! 
 I wish I'd have met him first. 
Dick, do you have a problem with this? 
No, why should I? Sally's 
fulfilling her purpose as a woman. 
Oh, please, Dick, not every woman feels her life is incomplete until she got a man. 
Well, hasn't your life been better since you met me? 
Yes. But we've taken the time 
to learn about each other. 
And we've learned a lot We've been together over a year, we're not getting married. 
Certainly not. 
 We've never even discussed it. 
You never brought it up. 
 Neither have you. 
We're talking about it now. 
I have a phone call to make. 
 Me too. 
Whoa, beautiful flowers. 
 Oh, thanks, I arranged them. 
Really? 
You did a great job. 
Ah-ah, don't touch. You don't 
want to over-bunch the vase. 
Each flower has to be allowed to have its own moment. 
Oh, yeah, moment. 
Erm, my uncle wally owns a flower shop in Florida. 
His roommate Jasper, helps him run it. 
So, you think he'll pass it down to his kids? 
No, I think the legacy stopped right there in south beach. Sorry. 
See, this is the third set of little people you've sent me, and once again they bear no resemblance to me or my future husband. 
Get it right! 
Sally! I got it, 
everything you asked for. 
Oh, what a relief! 
Something old.. 
a radial, courtesy of the alley. 
Something new.. 
a tub of Vaseline with an unbroken seal. Sweet! 
Something borrowed.. 
a cup of sea salt from Miss Dubcek. 
And finally, the piece de resistenance.. 
something blue.. 
a lifesaver! 
Minty. 
That's perfect, Harry. 
Ooh! Those are beautiful! 
Oh thanks, I was tempted to use willow branches, but they seemed a bit stark. 
You're very artistic. 
 Yeah, I'm sure that's the word. 
Hello, Sally. 
 Hey. 
I heard the news. 
Wow! 
It happened so suddenly. 
Cut to the chase, Mary. 
Sally, she thinks you're crazy. 
What?! 
 No, I didn't say that. 
It's.. it's just 
that I'm concerned. 
I want the best for you and this all happened so quickly. 
Mary, you are so transparent. 
You're jealous. 
 What? 
You are. 
 You are!  Yeah. 
You wanna get married too. 
 You do! 
Well sure, when I'm ready. 
 And you don't think I'm ready? 
Well, I just think you should wait. 
Until when? I'm middle-aged and I 
have to walk out of the bedroom backwards so my husband won't see my ripply butt? 
Oh, stop. 
Mary! 
That's what you do! 
Okay. I guess this was 
none of my business. 
You're doing it again! 
I'm sorry I even tried. 
No wait, Dr. Albright. 
Wait wait wait! 
Look. Look, just.. here. 
Sit down here, okay? 
It's just that I got so... 
damn arrogant, you know, that I got proposed to. 
I mean, it's like I finally got something I can lord over other women. 
And that's not right, no. 
 No. 
I want you to be happy for me, Mary. 
I'd like you to be in my wedding. 
Bridesmaid? 
Better. I want you to 
be my maid of honour. 
My bitter old maid of honour. 
Gentlemen, how do you know when it's time to get married? 
Right when that little stick thing turns blue. 
I mean, do you get married when the relationship stops to be about sex and starts becoming deeper? 
Deeper than sex? 
I just don't know if I'm ready. 
Dr. Albright is tightening the old 
matrimonial chokehold, isn't she? 
Oh I wish. Unfortunately 
she wants to get married. 
I guess I'm just gonna have to ask her. 
Well why don't you buy yourself some time by giving her an engagement ring? 
A ring? 
 Sure, something big and showy, you know. 
It proves how much you care for her and that way you can drag it out for years. 
So I just tag her, put her on the shelf, so I can pick her up whenever I want like.. like human layaway? 
I like it. 
I like that one. 
 Hmm, it's very you. 
Sally, I've been an insensitive clod. 
Yeah, I'm used to that by now. 
No no. Not to you, 
to Dr. Albright, 
which is why I've decided to ask her to marry me. 
Good for you. 
Thank you. 
And as high commander, my wedding is more important than yours. 
So I get to go first. 
What?! 
You horrible, horrible man! 
Why do you wanna rain on my parade? 
The one chance I get to feel special, and you want to take it away from me! 
I want to be the bride! 
Me, bride! 
I.. I'm sorry, forgive me. 
I'm being selfish. 
You're right. 
You should go first. 
You've already ordered your cake and... 
I haven't even popped the question yet. 
Now stop crying. 
There's my girl... 
and what a big girl you are. 
And soon I'll have to give you away to another man. 
And what a pretty bride you'll make. 
"Where are you going, my little one, little one" "Where are you going, my baby, my own" "Turn around and you're tiny" "turn around and you're grown" "turn around and you're a young wife" "with babes of your own". 
To you, Dr. Solomon. 
 To me. 
You are a great American. 
In France, it would be very hard to find a man, that would accept money for his sister. 
And it was impossible in Wisconsin. 
Hmm, yeah. 
She's all yours now. I bet you 
can't wait to sleep with her. 
Pardon? 
 You know, the big night, la nuit grande. 
No no no, professor Solomon, this is a legal arrangement only, I will not touch your sister. 
No, You have to! 
She's dying to! 
Are you positive? 
Of course, it's like those sneakers ads say, "just do her". 
You are a very strange family... 
but strange in a way... 
I can accept, huh? 
Salut! 
 A votre sant�.  D'accord. 
Oh, don't push. 
I'll buzz you in. 
Wait to push. 
I'll buzz, then you push. 
Listen to me! 
Wait for the buzzer to stop! 
And they wonder why old downtown Rutherford is dead. 
You can't get into the stores! 
Good morning, sir, lovely day. 
Yes. Is there 
something I can show you? 
Engagement rings for women. 
Oh, excellent, excellent. 
Diamond engagements are right over here. 
Uh... we'll start small. 
Ooh, this one looks nice. 
How much is it? 
Ah-ha, that one is... 
three thousand dollars. 
For a diamond! 
Where I come from, we use the big ones for doorstops! 
Sir, you mustn't think in terms of price. 
The ring is a symbol. 
 A symbol? 
Yes, the circular shape represents never-ending love. 
Circular shape... 
Great! 
I'll give her my watch. 
Knickers? 
 They're crushed velvet. 
Nice, do you... like them? 
I made them. 
Tommy...kiss me. 
Err... do you wanna 
go out to the rambler? 
There's a few minutes before this whole procession. 
No, I was just checking something. 
Hey! Hey, don't start 
the mower unless you're ready to cut the grass! 
Oh, Sally... 
you look so beautiful, so exquisite, so.. 
bold! 
You, my lucky lady, are in charge of that train. 
Hey, Harry. 
Um... who's that? 
Sally, meet blind Joe Slocum. 
He's old, I borrowed him from the tip top club, and he plays the blues. 
Okay, so what do you have that's new? 
 He's my new friend. 
So are you of the bride's family or the groom's? 
Neither, I am with the immigration and naturalisation service. 
I have reason to believe that there is an illegal alien in the wedding party. 
Really? 
Mary. 
There's something I've got to ask you before this whole thing starts. 
Oh Dick, not again. 
You're on Sally's left, and remember, no skipping down the aisle. 
Can I borrow a toothbrush? 
There is the most adorable man out there with the government. 
He's looking for aliens. 
Thank you, Miss Dubcek. 
Now go out there and hypnotise him with your feminine wiles. 
Never been a problem. Oh! 
 Okay. 
Family meeting! 
Family meeting. 
Where? 
 Are you sure? 
I've got to see Michel. 
No, wait wait wait! 
wait wait wait... 
What's going on? 
 They're white. 
I'm...I'm so sorry, Michel, 
but I can't marry you. 
 What?! 
I'm sorry. 
But I need to get married, they'll send me back. I'm an alien. 
What? 
I'm an alien. 
Wow, okay. 
See this is never gonna work because... I'm an alien too. 
What? Then.. then what is the point of this? 
 I don't know. 
Then give me back my money. 
Well I can't, I spent it on the dress. 
What? But.. 
Pull yourself together, man. 
Listen, somebody's here looking for you. 
Now come with us and we'll protect you. 
No! No no no no, I am sick 
of you and your crazy people. 
Crazy people! 
You're crazy! 
Hey, you! 
Come on, Albright. 
Oh, Mary, uh.. 
we're leaving town. 
No particular reason, you know, call of the road. 
Oh, Dick, you shouldn't be embarrassed. 
Michel's the one who got arrested. 
They got Michel! 
Oh! 
The other guy from immigration. It was an ugly fight. 
The French tend to kick a lot when frightened. 
Immigration? 
Yeah, they said they'll be sending him back to France in the morning. 
Of course, he's from another country! 
That's why he's an Alien. 
Alien from France. 
 Oh. 
Not a quivering purple tube from a distant galaxy, sent to study humankind. 
What? I said "not". 
I'm sorry, Sally. 
It's all right, you know. I 
got the cake, I got the dress, I got almost all the way to the altar. 
But you didn't get married. 
 I know, but what the heck. 
Hey, as long as we're all dressed up, who wants to go bowling? 
Tommy, Harry, grab my train. 
She made a beautiful bride. 
She'll make a beautiful bowler. 
Mary. 
There's something I've been wanting to ask you for several days now. 
I thought about it long and hard and I know it's the right thing to do. 
Mary... 
will you wear my watch? 
I can't wear this. 
Oh, I see... 
I thought it's what you wanted. 
It's just too big. 
I know it's a big step, but don't you think that maybe someday you might want to wear it? 
Well... maybe if.. 
if I gain a lot of weight. 
Cake? 
Some white irises, Gerber daisies, and a sprig of eucalyptus for balance and scent. 
Cool, what you doing? 
Yeah, I'm making a centerpiece for the football team. 
Really? 
 Yeah, it'll go great on their training table. 
I can't wait to see their faces when they see this baby. 
Ooh, it's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
You know, Mr. Randell, 
we've only been out on six dates, but already I feel comfortable with you. 
You make me feel so feminine, which is ironic 'cause I could snap your neck like a twig. 
Thanks. 
Oh, Mr. Randell. 
Sally, do you want to go back to my apartment? 
Oh, I know what's going to happen there, We'll continue to kiss and touch and kiss and touch just like the movies, and all of a sudden the scene ends, and we're in the park eating hot dogs and laughing. 
That's such a Sally thing to say. 
You're never what I expect. 
Yeah, like that time you didn't have to pay for dinner 'cause I got us thrown out of the sizzler. 
Like that, yeah. 
 But that's what you like about me, right? 
Right, right, right, right, right? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
But now it's starting to, um... 
I don't know.. 
irritate me. 
I'm not the perfect woman? 
This close, really. 
Just a couple, three, four things you could change. 
Maybe let me be in control sometimes, just a little. 
Well, you're going to see a whole new me. 
God, I hate that. 
It's gone. 
Oh... I should have 
let you do that. 
Whoopsy doodle. 
Good-bye, basket of kittens. 
I can only pray that next month's photo will bring us a fraction of the joy and whimsy... 
...that you did. 
Thank you, bank of Rutherford. 
What? That's a monkey playing golf. 
I know, but he's putting with a driver. 
You never see yourself clearly until you see yourself through your lover's eyes. 
I am red freakin' hot! 
Good for you. 
And I'm a loud, destructive, irritating pain in the butt. 
Mr. Randell's not crazy 
about me anymore, Dick. 
Sally, don't tell me you're failing at your relationship. 
How could you? 
I don't know. 
I thought I had this whole woman thing aced. 
My performance has been technically flawless. 
He wants me to change. 
Well Sally, here on earth, humans change for their lovers. 
August and I always accommodate each other's wants and needs. 
For example, I stopped wearing old spice, and she's stopped telling me to stop wearing old spice. 
Oh...don't compare 
my mature relationships to your little "tigerbeat" tryst. 
Yeah, she's right. 
Tommy, adults have far more complicated problems. 
Although, come to think of it, Dr. Albright and I are adults, 
and we have none. 
I have struck gold with her, grabbed the prize, hit the jackpot. 
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding! 
You're a winner. 
You didn't win. 
You lucked out. 
Love doesn't just drop into your lap. 
You've got to force it there. 
I don't know, Dick. I'm beginning 
to wonder if I've got what it takes. 
Of course you've got what it takes. You're a warrior lieutenant, 
and this is the battle of the sexes. 
You can win it! 
You know, I envy you. 
Everybody in this house has got somebody except me. 
But when I do make my love connection, lady beware. 
I change for no one. 
Harry, you sound like an idiot. 
And that will never change. 
Tommy? 
Let's say I got into this horrible car crash, and I wasn't really hurt, but my hair fell out from the shock. 
Would you still like me? 
What about the eyebrows? 
 Gone. 
Yeah, sure, I'd still like you, of course. 
It would take a couple of days to get used to. 
Did you see the monkey? 
 I saw the monkey. 
What if my sight went next? 
I'm bald, with no eyebrows, and I can't see. Would 
you still go out with me? 
I'd stand by you. 
Of course, you wouldn't know it. 
Why don't you go out and find your own girlfriend? 
With my schedule, where would I find the time? 
Oh, my god. I have got 
the most brilliant idea. 
You should contact a video dating service. 
You think? 
 Yes! August, that's genius. 
In fact, I bet they're open right now. 
Yes. 
Yes, yes. 
There is a woman out there with my name on her. 
I will find her, and nothing's gonna to stop me, unless I get distracted by something shiny. 
You look lovely today. 
Thank you. 
And you like everything else about me, too? 
 Yes. 
Have I done anything to upset you? 
 No. 
Great, 'cause I'm really trying to change for you, Kevin. 
I have been so bad. 
Have you decided on a wine? 
What do you feel like? Red or white? 
I don't know. You decide. 
We'll have a bottle of merlot. 
We're out of bread. 
You want more bread? 
I don't know. 
You decide. 
Is it cold in here, or is it just me? 
I don't know. 
You decide. 
Sally what are you doing? 
I don't know, you decide. 
If there's a problem here, just say so. 
Oh, there's no problem. I'm 
just trying to please you. 
Would you just drop this Okay? 
Something's wrong, isn't it? 
You like to play naive, but you know exactly what you're doing. 
Back up. Is naive a good 
thing in a woman or a bad thing? 
Are you trying to drag me into some neofeminist debate? 
I don't know. 
You decide! 
Fine. 
I've decided. 
Lunch is over. 
Aw, listen, hun, there are other fish in the sea. 
I don't want to hear about the specials, lady. 
Hi, my name is Harry Solomon. 
My turn-ons are sunshine, beach houses, and baking bread with my blouse off. 
I wasn't rolling. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
All right, Harry. 
This is all about just being yourself Okay. 
I want you to just relax, act natural, and have fun, okay? 
All right, here we go. 
Okay. 
I was brought up... 
on the backstreets learned to love before I could eat educated, ow-Ww! 
At Woodstock I'm a soul man! 
Friday would be fine. 
Yeah, I see no problem with.. 
I'll call you back. 
Hello  Hehwoh.. 
This is Mr. Poopie bear. 
Is this my wittle bunny face doll? 
Hi, Mr. Poopie bear. 
Is wou happy? 
I'd be happier if I was in a big snuggle buggle with wou. 
Snuggle, snuggle, snuggle, snuggle, snuggle, snuggle. 
Oh. 
 Hehwoh? 
Heh-woh! 
Oh, heh-woh. 
Dick, I need to talk. 
Well, sure. 
 I just had a horrible lunch with Kevin. 
Tell me what happened. 
I tried to change for him, and he still got mad at me. 
I thought I'd done everything right. 
 I'm sure you did. 
What do you think he needs from me? 
 Sally, sit down. 
Honey, I'm a man, and here's something that I've learned. 
How can I put this? 
Men... are 
completely incapable of.. 
talking about relationships. 
Here's two women. 
Dump on them. 
What does this remind you of? 
That time in Vienna. 
That waiter, those long walks. 
 And this coffee. 
Yeah. 
What's going on? 
Sally's tense, I'm taking her away with flavored coffee. 
Who am I kidding? I've 
never even been to Vienna! 
Well, this is amaretto. 
A broken heart demands mocha mint! 
I'm sorry. 
You can't blame me... 
Sally, what's wrong? 
Look at these chairs. 
I don't know if it's the fabric, or the pattern, or that Mr. Randell hates me, 
or maybe we just need a couch. 
The fabric is a bit loud. 
 It's Mr. Randell. 
Sally, please, stop being so sad. 
I'm not sad. I'm angry. 
 Then why are you leaking? 
I don't know! 
It's a whole new leak. 
My relationship with Mr. Randell is broken. 
No matter what I say to him, I can't fix it. 
Stop saying, and start doing. 
You've got to have more sex. 
More? I've never had any, ever. 
Ever? 
Well... 
there's the black fly in your chardonnay. 
You've got to start. 
Sex fixes everything. 
It's the neosporin of Amore. 
Uh... Dick, I don't 
know about that. 
August says it's very in nowadays to save yourself for marriage. 
Excuse me, could we please not talk about marriage? 
I can't even get through dinner with this guy. 
Are you just going to give up? 
He's just not happy with me anymore Dick. 
You think you can just walk out of here and find another man? 
I mean, really, just look at yourself. 
 What? 
Oh, those comically long legs, that blindingly shiny hair, those unruly breasts. 
All right! 
I get the picture! 
Sally, he seems like a nice guy. 
Maybe he'll do it out of pity. 
Are you sure? 
Come here. 
I know the thought of giving yourself to someone is at once frightening and exciting, but embrace it. 
Let go of yourself. 
I mean, Dr. Albright dove right 
in, and it was her first time. 
Um... ahem.. 
coffee, anyone? 
Look, maybe you need a little something to uh.. 
to get you in the mood. 
I have a movie that you can borrow. 
"Homeward bound". 
Is this supposed to help? 
 Couldn't hurt. 
The scene where the cat falls off the wet log... 
you'll notice that part of the tape is a little worn. 
Here. 
Mocha mint for you. 
Thanks, Tommy. 
 Yeah. 
You know, personally, I think Dick's going a little overboard with the whole thing. 
You have to realize making love to Mr. Randell is your decision. 
You're right. 
I'll do it. 
I mean, what do I have to lose except my virginity? 
Good-bye, Mr. Hymen. 
You're firing our accountant? 
Oh! 
What do you look for in the opposite sex, Harry? 
Big bosoms... 
and teeth. 
Harry, you're so natural and so sincere, not to mention your features are positively chiseled. 
Yeah yeah, I had no idea that you prefer one large meal a day, or that your favorite color is clear. 
 Clear. 
Tommy... 
we have to talk. 
 August, are you okay? 
I'll be all right. 
Fortunately, the hamster didn't have rabies. 
The hamster? 
 The hamster that bit my nose off. 
Yes, that's right, Tommy, my nose is gone. 
So, I suppose you want your ring back. 
Uh... well, no. 
Uh... can't they, like, stick it 
back on somehow? 
And that would be the only way you'd continue to see me? 
With my nose back, that is? 
No, I didn't say that. Uh... 
uh... I guess we'll 
just work through this whole nose thing together. 
No! 
 Surprise! 
I never should have doubted you, Tommy. 
Yeah! 
Yeah. 
Hi, Sally. 
 Hi. 
I wasn't expecting to see you. 
Well, you know me, little old impulsive Sally. 
I've decided we need to take things to another level. 
Sally, I think we have a lot of issues that need to be resolved. 
By another level, I mean this. 
We can put those issues on the back burner for awhile. 
I really want to please you, Kevin. 
You didn't have to stop to tell me that. 
This is going to fix everything, right? 
Well, it's going to fix a couple of things. 
If it's not going to fix everything, why are we doing it? 
Okay, this wasn't my idea, Sally. 
It wasn't mine, either. 
It was my family's. 
Your family convinced you to sleep with me? 
Yeah, we really think you're worth it. 
What am I, some kind of experiment? 
You make that sound like a bad thing. 
Why does everything have to be so difficult with you? 
If I'm so damn difficult, why do you want to have sex with me? 
Because you're laying on top of me. 
That's your answer for everything. 
 I give up. 
You give up, good. That means I win. 
 No, you don't win. 
You win? 
 I don't win, either. 
No one wins? 
 No. 
This really sucks. 
 Yes, it does. 
I don't want to play anymore. 
 Neither do I. 
I think one of us should leave. 
And since this is your apartment, I guess that would be me. 
Good-bye. 
You know, I've... 
never lost before. 
I'm sorry. 
Tell me what happened. 
I went over there to fix things, and instead I ruined everything. 
And the worst part is, I'm still a virgin. 
Oh, my god. 
You're a virgin? 
Yes, I know. 
It's horrible. 
No, no, no, no, it's wonderful. 
It is? 
Yes. It's perfectly all right to 
save yourself for the right man. 
Like you did for Dick? 
Yes. 
The point is, breaking up with Kevin was smart. 
He wanted you to be something you're not, and you're fine just the way you are. 
I like you, Sally. 
I didn't know you liked me. 
Well, I do. 
You're a strong, opinionated, intelligent young woman. 
Unpredictable at times, a little scary, but, hell, that's you. 
That is me. 
I like me, too, but why didn't Mr. Randell? 
Well, he's just not the right guy for you. 
But you'll find someone. 
I mean, just look at you. 
Those legs, that hair.. 
Please! I've been dragged 
through the muck enough today. 
Just chalk this up to experience. 
Thanks, Dr. Albright. 
You're so nice. 
I always thought you were such a bitch. 
Oh, I am, but, hell, that's me. 
Well, hello. 
 Hi. 
I gotta say, I'm shocked. 
That videotape did not do you justice. 
What videotape? 
Oh. 
That must be Lydia. 
A little more knuckle hair than I had hoped for, but.. 
a guy has got to start somewhere. 
You know what this coffee reminds me of? 
That little cafe in Amsterdam? 
No, that I used the coffee pot to drain the freon out of the air conditioner. 
yeah. 
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it? 
The birds are chirping. 
The sky is blue. 
You're awfully cheery, considering you just lost your boyfriend. 
I'm okay. 
 You know, I feel sorry for you. 
I mean, this afternoon, I'm going shopping for drapes with Dr. Albright, 
and you'll be alone. 
And tomorrow I'm taking Dr. 
Albright to the recycling center, and you'll be alone. 
The way I look at it, Dick, I'm embarking on an adventure. 
The dating world is like a huge food court for me, and I can take my little red tray anywhere I like. 
I don't follow. 
Well, you see, Dick, it's like, with you, you know you're going to have grilled cheese every day, day after day after day after day. 
But me, tonight I might go Italian, tomorrow, Greek. 
Next week, who knows? 
Mexican, Chinese.. 
hot dog on a stick. 
Hey, Harry, come on, it's singles day at the mall. 
Lock and load. 
Grilled cheese. 
Tommy, We're late. 
Enjoy your lunch. 
Yeah, you, too. 
God, I love grilled cheese. 
Yeah. 
I could eat it every day. 
Day after day after day after day. 
Hey, do you have any sliced tomatoes? 
Yes! 
Yes, we do! 
Perfect mate has hundreds of compatible people for you. 
Let's go. 
My name is Sally, and I'm strong, loud, opinionated, and aggresive. 
I'm a big, angry virgin, and I'm happy about it. 
Oh, and I also enjoy walking barefoot in the sand, and the poems of Rod McKuen. 
So, if you're man enough for me, let's make a date. 
I love these Saturdays in the park. 
The soft grass, the chirping birds, the "eyewitness news" team. 
Save the park! 
Save the park! 
Makes you want to scream at the top of your lungs like those people. 
Let's eat over there! 
No! I prefer this table! It's in the shade! 
Hey, look! 
A butterfly! 
Hey, look, Sally! 
It's your friend Don! 
Sally. 
 Don. 
A word to the wise. There's 
trouble in the park today. 
Trouble? Uh-oh. I 
better take care of my baby. 
What is it? 
 Sometimes a wrinkle runs through the city, and it rears up on its haunches like an ugly monkey ready to strike. 
Don, you always have your finger up the pulse of danger. 
Save the park! Save the park! 
Save the park! 
Save the park! 
Hey, man, you want to sign this petition? 
The town's going to destroy bates park. 
Uh... maybe in 
a little while. 
There's no time, the dozers are on their way. 
Okay. I've chained myself to the tree. 
Oh! 
 Sir, sir, excuse me. 
Is it true you've chained yourself to that tree? 
Yes, that's exactly what I've done. 
So you won't free yourself even though the city bulldozers are on their way? 
No, I cannot do that. 
He may be an organized protester, he may be a rogue mountain man, but one thing's for sure he may be a hero. 
We got it. 
Is it on the right channel? 
Some of the stories we're tracking at this hour: A fire breaks out in a nursing home... 
 Ooh! 
a search for survivors continues at the Parma Heights mudslide, and in our Science Watch, a vet performs an operation that allows a cat to smile for the first time. 
Aww! 
That's the happiest cat in the world. 
Tonight's top story: a protest in Bates Park. 
Look! I'm on TV! 
 You're wearing my shirt. My shirt's on television. 
That's exactly what I've done. 
Hello? 
Yes, Harry Solomon lives here. 
Okay. 
Hold on. 
Harry has a phone call. 
A phone call. 
My first phone call. 
How do I look? 
 You look fine. 
Hello. 
Uh-huh. 
Okay. 
I'll have to talk it over with my family. 
Okay. Bye. 
Who was that? 
 It's a member from the independent party. 
They saw me on TV. They want 
me to run for city council. 
What's city council? 
I think it's some sort of council here in the city. 
Council? According to my 
civics class, that's government. 
Oh, Oh, this is big. 
This is big. We do not 
want to get involved in this. 
This will allow us to get on the inside, see how it works. 
What about our vow not to alter the course of the planet? 
Please. It's only politics. 
We dive in, master it, grab a few votes, get a little action. Nobody gets hurt. 
Harry, call those people back and tell them you'll run. 
Right you're the boss. 
 Sally, Tommy, you advise Harry on his campaign. 
I'm going to register to vote. 
 Shouldn't we all vote? 
No. We don't want 
to arouse suspicion. 
One in four seems right. 
Here's a list of candidates and referendums. 
So you're all set. You come 
back here in two weeks to vote. 
Right. And how many times do I get to vote? 
One time. 
And it doesn't matter that I'm brilliant? 
No. 
Have you noticed how tall I am? 
We all get one vote. 
So your opinion counts equally with mine? 
 You got it. 
You're awfully smug for a man who works at a folding table. 
Okay, let's see. 
For mayor, Heckie Mulligan. 
Hmm, funny name. 
I like that in a Mayor. 
Heckie Mulligan? 
How can you vote for Heckie Mulligan? Nina, can you believe that? 
How do you know I'm not voting for Mulligan? 
I thought you were a democrat. 
Why do you think I'm a democrat? Because I'm black? 
Go ahead, vote for Mulligan. 
 I'm not voting for Mulligan. 
Wait, I don't understand. 
Why are you getting so worked up over politics? 
It's simple. You vote for the 
best, the best man wins. 
Or woman. 
Oh that's priceless. 
What, Heckie's a woman? 
Frank Gansmiller. 
Glad to know you. 
Hey, Betty, the new speed bump keeping the teenagers away? 
Great, good. 
Norma, Tom, Patty, Cathy, Carl. 
Too bad about that warehouse fire. 
I'm glad to hear "the insurance" came through. 
Harry Solomon. 
I've never seen you before in my life. 
Hi, I'm Harry Solomon, a simple mind for a simple people. 
I can't believe Dr. Solomon 
is letting his brother run against Gansmiller. 
No one can dig up the dirt like Gansmiller. 
 The man's a backhoe. 
It's a piece of equipment. 
Don? 
 Sally, what brings you here? 
My brother threw his head into the ring. 
You mean his hat? 
 Yeah, sure, his hat. 
What brings you here? 
 Oh, the usual. 
Looking for trouble, making sure it doesn't happen. 
Punch? 
 Take your best shot. 
Frank Gansmiller. 
 Dick Solomon. 
Nice to know you, Dick. 
 I feel it only fair to warn you that your challenger is my brother Harry, and I am not easily swayed. 
I'll keep that in mind. 
 Mary, this is Frank Gansmiller. 
This must be the little lady? 
This must be the little man. 
Mary. 
Dick, it's all right, as long as Mary turns out to vote. 
Although I don't know if you're old enough to vote. 
 Yes, she is. 
She's 44. 
Mr. Gansmiller 
Frank, when I do vote, it won't be for you. 
Mary, Dick, let me get serious for just a moment. 
"Why should I vote for Frank Gansmiller?" You ask. 
I didn't ask. 
Mary won't let me get away with anything, will she, Dick? 
Not a thing, Frank. 
Why should I vote for Frank Gansmiller, Frank? 
Good question, Dick. 
Because I want to take money out of the drug dealers' pockets and give it back to the people. 
Oh, Frank's right. I want 
some of that drug money. 
All right, everybody. It's 
time to hear from our candidates. 
First up, our incumbent, Frank Gansmiller. 
Thank you. 
No, no. 
You know what? 
You all know me. 
Let's give the new kid a chance. 
 Yes, yes. 
This is a great man. 
 Dick, sit. 
Thank you, fellow... 
Rutherfordonianites. 
Anyway, I'm here because of all you people, Men, Women. 
Of course, if I had my way, there'd be like a lot more women. 
You know, on any given day, I see maybe one, two women, tops. 
I want to see more women. 
Everywhere I go, more women. 
More women in the workplace, yes! 
Okay. 
Vote Harry S. Solomon. 
The "S" stands for know-how. 
I'm sorry, Snow-How. 
Turn it off. 
I've seen enough. 
All right, whatta you got on him? 
Nothing, he's clean. 
Nothing, must have something rotten in his past? 
He's human, isn't he? 
 I've done every background check personally. 
There's nothing. 
It's like he... 
fell out of the sky. 
What about drinking? 
 No. 
Gambling? 
 No. 
Bad checks? Tax evasion? 
 No. 
Pornography, drug addiction, bad hairpiece? 
No! 
Zero divided by zero, zip, nada, bubkiss. 
Bubkiss huh? 
What does "bubkiss" mean? 
Nothing. 
 Yeah, I thought so. 
You know, it's almost as if he were... 
Amish. 
Damn! 
No past, no experience, no record, the perfect candidate. 
Wait a minute. 
What about that sister of his? 
 You leave her out of it! 
Ooh! 
Copper's got a girlfriend. 
Should there be a toll on the Cherry street bridge? 
Well, I never use it. 
Yes. 
 Yes. 
But what if I start using it? 
No. 
 Smart money on No. 
What am I thinking? There's 
nothing good on cherry street. 
Yes. 
No! 
No Yes! 
A resounding No-Yes. 
Okay, let's move on to the candidates. 
This should be a no-brainer. 
City council, district nine? Harry Solomon. 
Yaaaa? 
What? Don't tell me 
you're voting for Gansmiller. 
Don't tell me you're voting for Harry. 
 Yes, I'm voting for Harry. 
Then you're voting wrong. 
 There's no such thing as voting wrong. 
Yes, there is. 
You're doing it. 
You're making a mockery of this whole election by voting wrong. 
It's my vote I get to use it any way I want. 
What's the point of having a democracy if people go around voting wrong? 
In my opinion, democracy is doing just fine the way it is. 
Well, your opinion is wrong! 
I can't believe you're voting against your own brother. 
Ha, just watch me. 
 Dick! 
You're not going to vote for me? 
Well, that hurts. 
And I know because I feel your pain. 
But Harry Solomon is not worried... 
because Harry Solomon knows that Harry Solomon can win. 
How can you possibly win? 
Because Harry Solomon appeals to both sides. 
Vote for Harry Solomon. 
 Ow! 
Hi! 
 Hey, Mrs. Dubcek. You want a button? 
Yeah! I'm glad Harry is standing up 
for good old-fashioned family values. 
You could learn from this lesson, Sally. 
Never date a guy if he's not good to his wife and kids. 
Don. 
 Sally. 
We have to talk. 
Your brother is playing with matches, and that's how fires start. 
I know my way around a hose. 
This election could turn ugly, very ugly. 
I shouldn't be telling you this, but I had to warn you. 
You're the only thing in my life that isn't dirty. 
A girl can't stay clean forever in a town like this. 
Don't talk like that, Sally. 
You've got a great pair of getaway sticks. Now use 'em. 
Come on, Don. 
Be straight with me. 
You owe me that much. 
Follow the money, Sally, follow the money. 
Solomon. 
Gansmiller. 
Glad you came. 
 Wow. 
That's something I don't hear very often. 
Solomon, this election means a lot. 
What do you say we cut a deal? 
Well, what sort of deal? 
You drop out of the race, I'll make you building inspector. 
Why do I want to be building inspector? 
Because when the building inspector looks the other way, he gets an envelope. 
Well, what if the building inspector doesn't look the other way? 
He always looks the other way. 
Well, what's so special the other way? 
The envelope. 
 Well, what's in the envelope? 
I don't have to tell you what's in the envelope. 
Well you don't have to, but I sure would appreciate it. 
Look, what will it take you to drop out of this race? 
Well, don't ask me. I'm not 
the one who makes the decisions. 
You aren't? 
 No, never have, never will. 
I just sort of follow orders. 
Whose? 
 Well, we sort of have a leader. 
"We"? 
 The Family. 
The "Family". 
Thank you, Solomon. 
Thank you very much. 
Harry Solomon? 
How much do we really know about him? 
He claims to be a family man, but what kind of family? 
There's no hard proof that the Solomons are linked to the Gambinis, the Genoveses, and the Corleones, but is that a risk you're willing to take? 
Harry Solomon an offer you can refuse. 
Paid for by decent, God fearing citizens for Gansmiller. 
Don't say that. 
We can't be in the mob, we're from Ohio. 
That's terrible. 
Oh, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick. 
Dick, Dick. 
You are so out of the game. 
That was a gimme. 
He mentioned my name like 20 times. That was great publicity. 
But he's a liar. 
Dick, let me talk to you like you're a two-year-old. 
You know how when you see a commercial for Cheerios, and they keep showing you Cheerios, and you really want Cheerios... 
do we have any cheerios? 
Right next to the embarassing defeatios. 
What? 
 Nothing, sir. 
I'm sorry I'm late, sir. 
What are you doing? 
 I'm kissing your ring. 
I'm not wearing a ring. 
 I'm sorry. 
Please don't have me whacked. 
Whacked? What kind of nonsense is this? 
Well, sir, we just want to pay you the proper respects. 
We didn't know. 
 Know what? 
About your family connections, Don Solomon. 
It's that stupid ad. It's 
a complete and utter lie. 
I would hope you people would know better. 
Good, because I've had all I can take of this election foolishness. 
Aaaaaaah! 
This is ridiculous! 
Your political system is a sham! 
It's nothing but lies and propaganda. 
Look what it's done to you. 
You can't even tell who's good or bad or right or wrong. 
Give me science. 
At least with physics, you know when you have the right answer. 
 I never do. 
Cannoli? 
Oh, I'll be so glad when this election is over. 
Here. Do something with this. 
I'm so confused. I hardly 
even know what I'm doing. 
You're sitting on your cannoli. 
Look! Who did this! 
Everything's out of control! 
What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. 
I'm trying to vote my conscience, and I can't even hear it anymore. 
I have only two choices for city council, a professional liar and my brother, the joke. 
Neither of them should even be running for office. 
There is no choice. My only 
choice is not to vote at all. 
Democracy is horrible, absolutely horrible! 
You're so right. 
Democracy is the worst form of government there is, except for all of the others... 
and that is exactly why you have to vote. 
No! 
 Yes! 
If you don't vote, you can't complain. 
Complaining is all I have left. 
The system isn't perfect, but it's important to participate, even if you get it wrong. 
Just go to the polls and do what you think is right. 
Things were so much simpler where I come from. 
There's only one big giant office, and whoever outruns the fireball wins. 
Oh, god, I hope I did the right thing. 
And the results for city council are in. 
The incumbent, Frank Gansmiller, is the winner. 
So I would be... 
The loser. 
Okay, okay. 
I'd like to thank you all for supporting.. 
all righty. 
Harry, I want you to know that I voted for you. 
And to top off this night of firsts, there was also one write-in vote for a Dr. Mary Albright. 
That self-serving Bitch. 
I just had to come over and say great job, kid. 
It was a tough campaign all around. 
Glad to see no one went negative. 
Is that envelope job still available? 
No. 
Tough luck, kiddo, but your family's better off. 
You spend your life around garbage, you start to stink. 
I don't like the taste of losing, Don. 
It tastes like a bad egg. 
You know, the kind that gives you the burps. 
During this election, I've done some things, Sally, some things I'm not so proud of. 
Did I know better? 
Sure. 
But it's this... 
this town, this crazy town. 
Makes you want to brush your teeth. 
You're in luck. 
I'm packing. 
So, Dr. Solomon, did you 
hear someone voted for me? 
Yes, I think I did hear that somewhere. 
I wonder where that vote could have come from. 
 Who knows? 
It is a secret ballot. 
It was me, Dr. Albright. 
I voted for you. 
No, you didn't! 
How do you know? 
It was a secret ballot. 
Damn! 
I think we should vote for who's high commander. 
Sure. We're in a democracy. 
 Can we vote for ourselves? 
Of course. I vote for me. 
 I vote for me. 
I vote for me. 
 I vote for me. 
High commander breaks the tie, I win. 
Wait, wait, Let's vote again. 
This time I vote for Harry. 
This is America, you've got to wait four years. 
That's not fair. 
 Whoa! 
God bless America. 
I have got.. 
the perfect present for you. 
A present? What for? 
 Christmas. 
What, you didn't get me anything? 
No, are you kidding? No. 
Not get you anything, of course I got you something. I, uh... 
I got you the perfect something, it's perfect, and it's, uh, it's really something. 
You're so sweet. 
All right, we are wired. 
Can I plug it in? Can I plug it in? 
 Knock yourself out. 
It's magnificent! 
 You ain't seen nothing yet. 
By the time I'm through with this joint, they're gonna be able to see it from the shuttle. 
Tommy! 
Look what I got. 
 A stick? 
No! 
It's a Christmas tree! 
You'll see. All it needs is a little love. 
Dick! Dick! 
Dick you are not gonna believe what we got at the mall. - A stick? 
It's a Christmas tree! 
That thing? 
We are Solomons Harry. 
We should have the biggest, noblest tree in all of Ohio. 
Forget the stick, Dick. 
We found jobs. 
The mall is full of them.. 
Christmas jobs. 
You are lookin' at a professional gift-wrapper. 
And I am the executive assistant to Mr. Santa Claus. 
I've heard of him. He's the muckedy 
muck in charge of the whole shebang. 
Yeah, well, I'm kind of his right-hand elf. 
This is wonderful. 
It's a celebration. 
Tommy, when did we first land on this planet? 
January 9th. It was a Tuesday, 
exactly 8:30 P.M. 
7:30 central. 
Do you realize we're coming up on our anniversary? 
An earth year on earth, and everything is finally coming together. 
It's as if all of the earth were throwing us a party. 
Suddenly I feel so... so... 
human. 
Same here. - Me too. 
 I'm feeling kinda human here myself. 
Oh guys. 
"Snap"! 
Oh great...now it's a stick. 
Weeds. 
Okay, Dick, it's time to pick your secret Santa. 
It's time to who for wha-wha? 
Pick a name, that's who you buy a present for. 
Presents? for Christmas? 
The bowl is heavy. 
Let's see who this is. 
Let's play secret Santa. 
Dr. Anthony? 
I barely know him. 
Glansberg, Chilton, lanell Dick, you don't get to choose your person. It's random. 
You pick one name, and it's a secret until the party. 
Ohhh. 
Well I picked my name, and whoever it is hasn't the foggiest idea. 
For now until the party, their life will be a topsy-turvy labyrinth of mystery, and intrigue. 
For the love of god, let him draw again. 
Well, hello-ho-ho, everybody, and welcome to Santa's toyland. 
Presents, toys and fun for children one to ninety one. 
Oh, uh, please note that children sixteen to ninety one, should not sit on Santa's lap. 
Damn! 
Thank you, and have a happy and safe holiday, from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria. 
Wow, you've been shopping your butt off. 
Yeah. 
It's Christmas, right? 
Oh, it's great, isn't it? 
People buying stuff, lugging bags around, maxing out their credit cards. 
It's like everyone in the whole world is joined together to embrace financial ruin. 
Merry Christmas. 
 Thank you, and have a happy and safe holiday from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria! 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas. 
She's coin-operated. 
She says she has the perfect gift for me, and I have no idea what to get her. 
Her name is August Lefler. 
Well, I don't know August.. 
well, aren't you supposed to have some kind of list or something? 
Well, I'm afraid I left my list up in the north pole. 
Oh, great! Can't you have your 
wife fax it to you or something? 
I can't screw this up! 
Well, Tommy.. 
look, you want to make this August chick happy, you're gonna have to drop some cold, hard cash, you know what I'm Sayin'? 
On what? Listen, pork butt, 
I need model numbers here. 
Get a haircut. 
You look like a girl. 
What again? 
The root must be somewhere upstairs. 
Ooh, is that the gift you got for Judith? 
Or... whoever it was 
you happened to pick? 
Yes. 
 There's a $20 limit. 
I know. 
I went a little over. 
A hundred and twenty dollars over. 
It's easy to get carried away, isn't it? 
You know, a few years ago, I made a batch of my famous rum balls for Christmas. 
They were so popular that this year, just on a whim, I made 20 batches, enough for the whole department. 
Mmm. It's funny that you 
would have that much rum around. 
It's the holidays, Nina. 
 Yes, Nina, it's the holidays. 
My dad would go out and get the biggest Christmas tree he could find. 
We'd go caroling, open our house to the neighborhood. 
All that sharing and generosity.. 
It's so beautiful. 
Look how generous I am. 
I am Christmas! 
Hello, and happy holidays from all of us here.. 
 Where's my package? 
I'm supposed to say the whole thing. Hello, and happy holidays.. 
Excuse me. I was.. I was.. I was here first. 
Excuse me. 
I'm just picking up. 
Wo wo wo, come on, people. You're 
supposed to be happy. This is shopping. 
Yeah, well, I'm fed up. 
Where the hell's January already? 
What is wrong with you people? 
This isn't about buying gifts at all. 
This is about viciousness and ruthlessness and aggression, and... 
usually I like all those things, but... 
but now, it's just really ruining Christmas. 
Just wrap! 
Oh, don't worry, boys and girls. 
Santa will be right back after he takes care of some personal business. 
On the toilet. 
Oh, what are they feeding these kids? They weigh a ton! 
Well, you know, I think part of the problem is we're feeding 'em candy. 
Maybe if we could give them celery or some kinda... 
Oh... Santa. 
What are you..I mean.. 
it's.. you.. 
Noooo! 
"Oh Tannenbaum, Oh Tannenbaum.. 
..that's "Christmas tree" 
in German" Now this is a Christmas tree. 
Hey, hey, buddy, can I help you? 
Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas, officer! 
"Peace on earth, goodwill toward men".. what a crock! 
Nine hundred dollars in fines, and they confiscated your chain saw? 
And have you ever felt a taser? 
It's not nearly as much fun as it looks. 
What a bunch of hypocrites! 
Apparently, the Christmas spirit doesn't apply when you're trespassing and vandalising. 
Oh, let's face it, Christmas is a sham. 
How can humans take something like shopping, something pure and natural and good, and turn it into something so ugly? 
This is not a holiday, this is torture. 
They know exactly what they want, but they won't tell you. 
No-o...they make you guess. 
This is just so "Earth". 
Humans.. I don't want to play 
any of their reindeer games. 
"fa, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la" 'tis the season to be jolly... 
Oh, listen to them. 
Singing like idiots. Why did we 
want to be like humans anyway? 
That's better. 
And so we see that that B equals, 2a over delta, which equals k times mass over 2 pi delta, and therefore.. 
Leon? 
What are you passing around? 
 Oh, Caryn made them. 
Yeah, they're Christmas cookies. 
 Oh, how christmasy. 
All sparkly, red and green. 
Oh, look. 
One of Santa's reindeer. 
Watch him fly. 
And look, a little Christmas bell. 
"Ding, dong" I don't even know what this is. 
It was a snowman. 
No, it was butter and sugar and sprinkles, all wrapped up in empty sentiment and holiday hypocrisy. 
Ho! Ho, ho, ho, 
ho, ho, ho, ho! 
Where do you think you're going? 
 It's Christmas break. 
It is not "Christmas break" until I say it is. 
Not until you've completed the following remedial assignment. 
You will write a 15-page dissertation on wave physics and its relation to electromagnetic radiation. 
Oh, and a five-point bonus if you can tell me how the hell Santa delivers all those toys in one night. 
It's to be typewritten and on my desk no later than 6:00. 
Tonight? 
 But it's December 23rd. 
Yeah, it's Christmas eve eve. 
Ohh, it is? 
Well, tough tinsel. 
Thank you and have a happy, safe holiday from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria. 
Bye-bye, now. 
Hey, Tommy. 
 I finally found something for August. 
Oh, perfume. Is this what she wants? 
 I don't know. 
So I also got her a portable Cd player. 
 Oh, she likes CDs. 
I don't know. So I got 
her earrings... 
oh, yeah, and a cellular phone and a belt. 
How did you afford all this stuff? 
You know that jar of pennies I have in my room? 
 Yeah. 
It's where I hide Dick's credit card. 
Bartender, two fingers, no fat. 
I believed in him. 
I thought we were bringing joy to the world. 
I was gonna move to the north pole to work in his toy factory. 
Well, look what the cat dragged in. 
You got a lot of guts coming in here, fat boy. 
Do I know you? 
Oh, don't get cute with me, Kringle. 
If that is your real name. 
Hey, what's your problem? 
You're my problem! 
So what are you gonna do? 
Get one of your reindeer to kick me to death? 
Hey, take it easy, take it easy. 
 Oh, mind your.. 
Whoa! 
Wait a second. 
But you.. he.. 
Is there a problem? 
Jingle bell, jingle bell jingle bell rock... 
you know, this is the only time of year I like white music. 
What do you think, Nina? 
Mmm. 
Too much egg Needs more Nog? 
 Yep. 
Mmm, that is good! 
Rum ball? 
 Oh, spare me. 
You better be nice to me if you want your stocking stuffed. 
Hey! 
There will be no holiday cheer, Nina, while there's work to be done. 
Work? On Christmas eve eve? 
I'll need all the grades for my 10:00 class broken down and re tabulated for the whole semester. 
On Christmas eve eve? 
 Yes. 
Dick, we need somebody tall to hang the boughs of holly. 
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, no. 
I guess I'd like the plaid.. 
 We're out of everything but green foil and happy snowmen. 
Well, it's for my mom, so.. 
 You got your mom a dust miser? 
How nice.. the gift 
that keeps on sucking. 
I just didn't know what to get her. 
 Yeah, apparently not. 
Wait a second. 
Where was that.. here you go. 
A foot massager. The woman 
needs a break, for crying out loud. 
Gosh, thanks. 
 You're welcome. 
Hey, that's my foot massager. 
 Oh, poor baby. 
Who's it for? 
 My wife. 
Wow, real romantic. 
Here, wait a second. 
Ah! Some exotic 
bath oils. 
You can turn your wife into a slip 'n' slide. - Thanks. 
That.. that was for my boyfriend. 
Unless you have a better idea. 
As a matter of fact, I do. Here. 
International beer basket from the liquor locker. 
Oh, yeah! Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
This is fun. 
Hey, uh, diamond tennis bracelet. Who wants one? 
All this laughing, opening their little presents.. 
who needs Christmas anyway? 
I say, "bug Humbar". 
You mean, "bah, humbug". 
Bah" what? 
 You said, "bug Humbar". 
And? 
 Well, what does "bug Humbar" mean? 
Well, what does "bah, humbug" mean? 
 Forget it. 
Here, Merry Christmas. 
You bought me a gift? 
 Yeah. 
So you were my secret Santa? 
I was not your secret Santa. 
I just happen to love Christmas. Now, open your damn present! 
Well, what is it? 
 It's a travel mug. 
What's it for? 
So you don't spill coffee in your lap every morning. 
You noticed? 
Uh, yeah. 
I need this. 
 You're welcome. 
Nina... 
forget the work. 
Go to the party. 
Are you sure? 
 Yes. Have a good time. 
And Nina, M..merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas, Dr. Solomon. 
Where are those rum dreidels I made for Dr. Schwartz? 
Mary, look what Nina gave me! 
I'm not talking to you. 
You're ruining my Christmas. 
No, no, that was the old Dick. I 
think I've actually got the spirit. 
I want to be a part of Christmas now. 
Well, pah, dum, a, dum, pum. 
Here you go, Dr. Solomon. 
 Dr. Solomon. 
Your papers? 
 Sorry we're late. Don't take points off. 
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! 
 What are you doing? We worked on those! 
And in the spirit of Christmas , I'm not even gonna read them. 
I'm gonna give you all Cs! 
"Cs"? 
 Yes! 
Oh, what the hell, it's Christmas. C-pluses! 
Go, go, all of you, trim your stockings and stuff your trees! 
Merry Christmas! 
God bless us, every one. 
Judith! Judith! 
Judith, come in here! 
Judith, I'm your secret Santa. 
Get out. 
Here. Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
And happy new year. 
 Same to you. 
May your holiday be filled with lords a-leaping, ladies dancing, pipers piping, drummers drumming, geese a-laying, swans a-swimming. 
 That will do. 
Five golden rings! 
I know I've had a lot of rum balls, but that was really sweet. 
It's just wonderful. 
I thought Christmas was all about stress and hostility and handcuffs and Miranda rights. 
But no, it's more. 
It's so much more! 
It's about giving and sharing and just... 
being human. 
Come on, the party's still going on, and I've saved a special dance for you. 
Ohh. 
That weed grew back again. 
It's mistletoe. 
 Mistletoe? 
Yeah. 
 Well, what's it for? 
I'll show you. 
Merry Christmas. 
 Oh, merry Christmas to you. 
But what's the mistletoe for? 
Dick! 
Ohh. 
Ah, well I don't know how the real Santa's gonna slide down this thing, but he will. 
Ah, what a lovely way to mark our first anniversary on earth, our first anniversary as humans. 
Do you think we'll ever really know everything there is to know about being human? 
Merry Christmas, Tommy. 
This? 
I made it myself. 
It's the two of us. See? 
What I got for you is so much better than this! 
I mean, it is a joke how much better my stuff is than this! 
Which I love. 
Hmm. I made the front page 
of the daily Badgerian again. 
What's it say? 
"Physics Professor calls Einstein "idiot"... 
proclaims self much smarter". 
Something smells divine. 
It's me.  I just know 
it's me. 
Ooh, look at those clouds. 
 That one looks like me. 
So does that one. 
That one makes me look fat. 
That one looks like a poodle.. 
a dark, menacing poodle. 
Yeah, it's wheezing lightning. 
I think we should go in. 
 Yeah. 
Harry? 
You coming? 
Yeah, just a sec. 
 Don't be long. 
Hey! That cloud looks 
like a giant funnel, with mobile homes stuck in it. 
Ohhh, look! 
A flying cow! 
Whoa! 
Dick! 
Where am I? 
Who am I? 
Mary! You're here. 
I didn't see your car. 
I have a new parking space. 
 Really? Where? 
There. 
 Where? 
There. 
 Whoo! 
What's the matter? 
 It's right there. 
In front of the building. I can 
almost smell your little pine tree. 
It's a great space, isn't it? 
 I don't understand. 
The university should have offered it to me first. 
I'm the star of the faculty. 
I'm the one whose brain everyone wants to dissect for science. 
Right, for science. 
I deserve it! 
 I have tenure! 
Oh, tenure! 
I suppose if someone sticks around a third-rate university long enough, they'd have to recognize her lack of drive somehow. 
Dick, you're overreacting. 
 I'm not overreacting. 
Overreacting would be going straight to the president of the university and telling him exactly how I feel. 
Where are you going? 
 Straight to the president of the university and telling him exactly how I feel! 
Dick, it's a parking space! 
You're acting like a child. 
Sit down. Tell me what's on your mind. 
President Dewey, a great injustice has been committed. 
Oh? Have I been 
indicted? 
Worse. I don't like 
my parking space. 
Yes, that is troublesome. 
I was thinking of something along the lines of g-34. 
Now, that's a good spot. 
I like that spot. 
And you're a good man. 
I like you. 
What's on your mind? 
Well..the space. 
Oh, sorry. That's for tenured 
personnel only. 
Then I order you to give me an even closer spot. 
Dick, I'm gonna do you a favour. 
 You're giving me the space? 
No, I'm gonna tell you a story. 
 Can't you see I'm upset? 
You're right, I'm going to let you do whatever you think is right. 
Well, then, I..I'm going to take the space. 
Sorry, no can do. 
Cigar? 
I'm warning you, either you give me that space or I quit! 
Ah, I understand. 
What space are you in now? 
 X17. Why? 
'Cause I'm giving that to my secretary. Bye, Dick. 
All right, for starters, looks like the storm knocked off some shingles. 
You lose anything else? 
 I don't know. Like what? 
I'll run down the list. 
Did you have any gutters? 
 No. 
Screens? 
 No. 
Antennas? 
 No. 
Direct satellite TV? 
Yes. 
Um, excuse me. 
Um, is this 417 Pensdale road? 
Yeah. 
 Are you my wife? 
No. 
 Ah. Good. 
Harry, you're back! 
Oh, we were so worried about you! 
Whoa! 
Are you my wife? 
Yeah, right. 
Harry, we have been looking all over for you. 
Geez, Harry, you're a mess. 
 Where have you been? 
Well, I'm not sure. 
My mind's a complete blank. 
So then you're fine. 
 Yeah. 
That's a relief, honey. 
You go watch your stories. 
I'll make you some toast. 
No sofa? 
That's weird. 
Mmm. High Commander's 
log book. 
Well, this sounds interesting. 
January 9th. 
We have successfully assumed human form, and have tricked the earthlings into thinking, that we are of their species. 
Oh, my god! 
They're Aliens! 
La la la. 
You've got to be kidding. 
 Nope. I did it. 
Walked off the job, stuck it to the man, told him to kiss my hairy polenta. 
Bye now! 
 You can't be serious. 
I couldn't be more serious. 
Please, pass me Mr. Potato man. 
Why are you doing this? 
 Because it's not fair. 
Well, life isn't fair. 
Well you could remedy that Mary, by giving me the space. 
That wouldn't be fair to me. 
Well life isn't fair, you said so yourself. 
Let it go Dick. 
 Fine! 
Uh, that's university property. 
Well they should have thought of that before giving away my parking space. 
Well what are you gonna do now? 
 Oh don't worry about me. 
I give Dewey about 10 minutes before he comes crawling back to me. 
Nina, can you help me with the water cooler? 
Dick. Dick! 
You have been sitting there for 10 days. 
For the last time, the university's not gonna call. 
Oh, they'll call. 
They'll call. 
And when they do, this phone is gonna really, really ring. 
I just wonder whether it's worth getting all meshuga over a parking space. 
Dick, I hate to interrupt the creep-fest, but would you stop thinking of yourself for a minute and think of the mission? 
Oh, my god, they're on a mission. 
I am the mission! 
We came to this pitiful planet to experience the human condition, but from all that I can ascertain, the human condition requires nothing more than complete and utter solipsistic self-absorption! 
And you can include that in your next transmission to the you-know-who. 
Uh, who? 
The big, giant head! 
Haven't you been listening? 
Oh, the big, giant, head... 
Thank you for seeing me, father, I.. 
didn't know where else to turn. 
Well, that's... 
why they pay me the big bucks, you know? 
Father, if someone.. 
say, a family member.. 
had helped you, cared for you, given you shelter. 
And you knew something terrible about them, it'd be okay to turn them over to the authorities for dissection, wouldn't it? 
Are they dangerous? 
 Yes, No, I don't know! 
I'm so alone and confused! 
You are not alone. 
There's someone up there who's watching over everything you do... 
at all times. 
There is? 
 Mmhmm. 
Is this person called "the big, giant head"? 
He goes by many names. 
 And you know him? 
Know him? I work for him. 
I see. 
Well, thank you for your time. 
 That's fine. 
Oh, my god! 
They're everywhere! 
We're out of cereal. 
We're out of milk. 
We're out of money. 
No milk? What am I gonna use in my coffee? 
No problem. 
We're out of coffee too. 
Harry keeps drinking it. It's 
like he's afraid to go to sleep. 
Harry? 
Harry, come in here. 
Are you feeling all right? 
 Yeah, oh yeah, fine, I'm fine. 
When I'm fine, I'm fine. 
How are you? 'Cause I'm fine. 
Tommy, go tuck Harry in bed. 
See that he gets some sleep. 
No! no no. 
No, I'm fine. 
Well, I guess this has been kind of tough on all of us. 
Dick, why don't you just apologise and get your job back? 
Apologise? 
Should the Venus De Milo apologise to the thug who broke its arms off? No! 
Should the sphinx apologise to the desert winds for eroding its nose? 
No! 
Should Jim Carey apologise to America for the cable guy? 
Perhaps. 
No, I'm not gonna apologise. 
I can play their waiting game. 
Yeah, well, if you want to play the eating game, you've got to do something. 
Oh, I plan to. I'm 
gonna get myself a new job, a job worthy of me! 
Oh, really? 
And where would that be? 
In America, land of opportunity! 
Welcome to Rusty's. 
How may I serve you? 
How do you make your burgers? 
 Excellent question. 
First a clamp comes down onto the cow's head, forcing it onto a conveyor belt, where a prod is inserted into the cow's rectum, electrocuting it. 
Give me two. 
 Thank you. 
And remember, at Rusty's, E. Coli is not 
on the menu. 
Stop saying that! 
Welcome to Rusty's. 
 Rusty burger and a monster fries. 
Very well. 
 Solomon, you're supposed to ask him if he wants a fried apple pie with that. 
But Dougy, I can't. 
I mean, just look at him. 
The rusty burger alone is enough to give him a coronary. 
The fried pie will be the death blow! 
Look, I didn't go to hamburger college to take crap from you. 
Hamburger college. 
They're not by chance looking for a physics professor, are they? 
It's a hamburger school! 
Once again, I find myself at the mercy of someone I wouldn't let pick my nose. 
I'm the most qualified. I'm the 
smartest. I should be running Rusty's! 
That's it. 
You're off register. 
Report immediately to the drive-thru window. 
Demoted? 
Dougy, no! 
Well, I don't know if I could come back to the university. 
No. 
Well, I am deeply hurt. 
I don't care how much you beg. I am not coming back. 
No. No. 
Well, to be honest, I'm entertaining some very interesting offers even as we speak. 
Well, you'd better get going, Dick. You 
know how Dougy hates it when you're late. 
I'll go, as soon as I find my hat. 
Uh, you're wearing your hat. 
Don't... be 
ridiculous. 
Don't you think I'd know if I were wearing my own hat? 
Ah! 
There it is. 
Yes, operator, you have to listen very carefully. 
I'm at 417 Pensdale road, and I'm surrounded by aliens. 
I need to talk to the president of the United States. 
Yeah, I know I need help. 
That's why I'm calling, Hallo? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
They've gotten to the phone company too. 
Thank you for making Rusty's a part of your day. 
Hello, Bug, Pitman. 
Welcome to Rusty's. 
How may I serve you? 
We're not hungry Dr Solomon. 
We just wanted to come in and see if you were really flippin' patties in the hamburger freak-out ward. 
You insolent little twerps! I should.. 
Well, what do we have here? 
A customer satisfaction card. 
"Rate the performance of your server". 
"F". 
Thank you for making Rusty's a part of your day. 
So this is where the great minds of Rutherford go when they're feeling underappreciated? 
Hello, Mary. 
 Hello, Dick. 
I see they've got you back behind the register. 
No, I'm just covering for Maurice.. he's out back having a smoke. 
A man of your brilliance quitting his job, over a stupid parking space! 
If it's so stupid, why don't you give it to me? 
 Never. 
Ah-ha! So you admit it's important. 
 I admit nothing. 
Give me a rusty dog, no onions. 
Would you like a fried pie with that? 
Yes. 
 No, Mary, don't do it! 
Give me the pie. 
Mary, you have your whole life ahead of you! 
Oh, Dick, why are you doing this to yourself? Can't you just come back? 
No, Mary. 
I have my pride! 
So you're working at Rusty's. 
Yes, they have some wonderful opportunities for advancement here. 
Did you know that the fry man who used to work here is now a multimillionaire? 
What happened? 
He lost his arm in the patty press and got a great lawyer. 
All right, gentlemen, prepare yourself for a fancy feast. 
Fancy feast? Can we afford that? 
 Yes, we can. 
Before I was shopping today, I found this aisle in the back that had these unbelievable savings.. 
tuna, liver, and new seafood blend for you finicky types. 
Wait a minute. 
You're feeding us cat? 
It's not cat, Tommy, it's salmon. 
There's just a picture of a cat on the label. 
The best part is, next to the food they had these adorable little gifts. 
Look. 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... 
I've never been happier in my life! 
I was playing with it today, and it got stuck behind the refrigerator, and I went nuts trying to get it! 
Hello? Hel... 
I've been awake for 16 days. 
That must be a record. 
So, I've got to know, are you one of them? 
I'm just going to step out of this closet now. 
If you are who you say you are, then who won the world series in 1956? 
Who? Who? 
I don't know! 
 I don't know either! 
Ha! 
Oh, I see what it's come to. 
You're too good for a Rusty's man. 
Dick, it's not what you think it is. 
I'm not sure what it was. 
I only came by to tell you that I spoke with President Dewey, and he's willing to meet with you. 
 Never! I have my pride. 
All right. 
All right, keep your pride. 
Suffer all you want. 
But what about your family? 
There's nothing wrong with my family. 
Your son is eating cat food! 
Cat food? 
Maybe you're right. 
I'm beginning to wonder if I was rash, quitting my job over a parking space. 
Stop wondering. 
I can't help thinking that it was my pride that clouded my judgment. 
Stop thinking. 
It did. 
Was it folly or sheer idiocy that led to my downfall? 
Folly. 
 Idiocy. 
No, I change my vote to "idiocy". 
Hello, President Dewey. 
 Hello, Mary. 
Dr. Solomon and I.. 
Dick! 
Hello, President Dewey. 
And thank you, Dr. 
Albright, for announcing me. 
I believe you have something to say to President Dewey. 
I would like to discuss the terms under which I will return to Pendleton. 
He wants to drop the parking thing. 
 That's good to hear. 
And in return, you will admit that you were wrong, and that this university was falling apart without me. 
Or not. 
 We're getting along very well without you. 
Thank you and good-bye. 
On no, but President Dewey, Dr. Solomon is aware 
of how pathetic he's been over the.. 
Mary.. Mary, Mary, Mary, 
Mary. This is beneath you 
Why don't you wait outside, and I'll settle this on my own terms, all right? 
Please! 
Please take me back! 
Sorry, can't do it. 
 Please! Please! 
I'll do anything! 
Just name it! 
You can apologise. 
 You want me to apologise? 
Yes. 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
That's fine, you can begin tomorrow. 
In my new parking spot? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
So, Dick, any problems getting your job back? 
Are you kidding? 
He begged me. 
Well, he didn't "Beg", beg, but it was clear enough. 
I take it you didn't get the space either. 
Not the "Space" space. 
But you know, I learned something very important. 
 What? 
That even if you're the high commander and brilliant, there's still time for a little humility. 
Thankfully, that time is now over. 
Ah, dinner! 
Let's eat, Harry. 
Oh, did you just say, "let's eat Harry"? 
Yeah, we're hungry, so it's time to eat, Harry. 
"Eat Harry". 
I see. 
Could I just have a moment, please? 
Whatever. 
Would you hurry it up? 
I'm starving. 
Whoa! 
That was a close one. 
Mmm, my favourite! 
Meat loaf deluxe-O. 
Well, Harry, we haven't had that since Dick quit his job three weeks ago. 
Dick quit his job? 
Yeah, why do you think he was working at Rusty's? 
Dick was working at Rusty's? 
Geez, Harry, don't you know anything? 
No. 
All I know is, I got a transmitter in my head, and Charlie's angels is on weeknights at 7:00. 
Oh, my god! 
It's 7:00 now! 
Mmm, thanks for the ride this morning. 
Oh, I couldn't let you walk. It's pouring. 
How's your new parking spot? 
 Awful! 
My house is closer. Dewey 
is gonna hear about this. 
And after that, for lunch, I'll have a rusty burger with fries. 
Actually, it's not so bad. 
Last time on Third Rock From The Sun. 
After trapping me in an invisible box, my evil replacement continued his diabolical plot to rule the world. 
Not knowing his true identity, my beloved Mary made a date with the scoundrel. 
But just as I thought my plight was lost forever, my entrapment was cleverly discovered by my stellar crew. 
Oh, you guys, there's an invisible box. 
Ow! Wow, 
that smarts! 
You're going to look hideous tomorrow. 
 You think? 
Yeah. There's this girl 
I knew. She hit her nose. 
Dustin Hoffman. 
 Mr. Randell's coming over. 
Hello! I'm trapped in a box here. 
Okay. 
Well, let's see. Anybody know how 
to open one of these things? 
Well, we know we can't smash it open with our heads. 
Tommy, go get a hammer. 
 Nobody's getting a hammer. 
Get a hammer. That's an order. 
 I'm sorry, sir, but you can't give us orders. 
Of all the insolent.. 
Dick you are no longer the high commander. 
Sorry... 
but if we let you out of that box, well, that's mutiny. 
Oh, mutiny shmutiny. 
Big, fat dutiny. 
Now, I'm sick of the new Dick. 
This Dick, he's one of us. 
So maybe he's not perfect, maybe his leadership skills verge on the pathetic, and maybe his incompetence has made our mission the laughingstock of the entire Galaxy. 
I think you've made your point. 
No, I haven't made my point. 
The point is that he's always been there for the three of us, and it's time the three of us take a stand for him. 
Aha, sure sure. That's easy for you to say. 
You don't have the responsibility I do. 
If we let him out and the big giant head gets wind of it, who do you think's going to take the fall? The information officer? 
The transmitter? 
I don't think so. It's going 
to be me, the woman. Typical. 
Sally! 
Think of all we've been through together. 
When brad dumped you, who ordered you to drink yourself silly until you had completely drowned your feelings for him? 
You did. 
And when I ran over your foot with the car, who drove you to the hospital the very next day? 
You did. 
And when you were hungry that day in the park, who stole that little girl's ice cream cone. 
Tommy did that. 
 It was my idea. 
It was. 
 True. 
Sir, you're right. 
I can't let you rot in this box. 
I've got to get you out of here. Come on, guys. 
Blood is thicker than water. 
 It is? 
I think. 
 It's not as thick as peanut butter. 
It's a pretty thick substance. 
 Chunky peanut butter? 
Get me out of here! 
The lighting is romantic, the champagne chilled. 
And now for some... 
erotic literature. 
"Make sure the 2x4 studs are cleated to the floor plates before applying the wallboard". 
Perfect. 
yoo-hoo! 
 Come on up. 
Oh! I like what you've done with the place. 
Just wait until you see.. 
the bedroom. 
Tonight... 
is about pleasure, a journey into the... 
taboo. 
I will let nothing.. 
destroy the mood. 
Nothing. 
I've seen these. 
Lieutenant! 
Ah, clap off, huh? 
You made it! 
 I'm free! I'm free! 
Tommy, thank you! 
I'm free! Freedom! Freedom! 
There's so much I've missed.. 
fresh air, the smell of bacon frying, watching talk shows with Harry. 
I didn't miss jerry springer's biker chick makeover, did I? 
It was Tuesday. 
 Oh, damn! 
Sally, why are you wearing that skirt? It makes you look frumpy. 
I knew it! 
That Dick upstairs said this look worked for me. 
You know, I hate him. 
 He crashed the rambler. 
He changed my name to Tommy. 
Where does that leave you? 
 He calls me Tommy, too. 
Is that Tommy and the number, 2..? 
 I don't know. 
The guy's a major head case. 
 I've heard enough. 
No one dictates humiliating and irrational edicts to my family. 
That's my job. 
Now, come on. 
Oh, oh, oh! 
And nobody better have touched my strawberries. 
Mary. 
What's she doing with him? 
Looks like he's plugging her pie hole. 
I think she likes it, Dick. 
Dick? 
 Dick? 
Dick. 
 Come on, Dick. 
What does she see in him? I mean.. 
Sure, he's gorgeous, but... it's 
all part of his depraved scheme. 
How dare he! 
How dare she. 
Did what we have mean nothing to her? 
Wait. 
She thinks he's me. 
But he's going to get her Because he's deceiving her! 
And she'll be his forever. In a way, mine. 
But she likes.. 
but he.. I oughta.. 
but, she, I.. 
 Dick, hey, snap out of it! 
You have to take action. 
 You're right. I've got it! 
We're moving to Florida. 
 What?! 
It's warm all the time. The 
land is cheap. And the fishing.. 
bass as big as your arm. 
We're not going anywhere. 
Now you listen to me. 
This afternoon when I was with Albright arranging this date.. 
you arranged this date? 
 Yeah, but the point is.. 
you set this up? What are you, his pimp? 
If you'd let me finish, I'll expl.. 
 You of all people.. 
Dick, get a grip and listen to her for a second. 
The point is Dick, that I tried to talk her out of this date, but she wouldn't listen to me because.. 
and don't ask me why.. 
she has some sort of emotional attachment to you. 
She said that? 
She cares about you so much, she is upstairs about to have sex with another man. 
She would do that for me? 
If you don't stop her. 
You're right. That tyrant has gone too far. 
I must defeat that man! 
 All right! 
I should have done that earlier. 
Okay, here's the plan. 
Tommy, Harry, you stay here. 
Sally, watch my back while I make a run for the bathroom. 
Okay, then what? 
 I use the bathroom. 
I've been stuck in a box for two days. 
Hold on. 
Enough. 
I think my tongue has a Charley horse. 
Well, saddle up. 
We're going for another ride. 
What is going on? Last 
time, you were so fast. 
Why don't we just get to it? 
"It"? 
What? 
You know...it. 
Oh, it. 
You'll get it, all right. 
You'll get all of it that you want. 
It is..on..it's way. 
Come on, Dick. 
He's taking forever. 
Who's taking forever? 
Toilet duck. 
He's tackling our stubborn buildup. 
Lieutenant, you're the woman. I need to know about "it". 
It what? 
 You know, it. 
Oh, it. 
Um...ahh...let's get some privacy. 
Okay, well, um... 
uh... it's, uh 
it's kind of involved. 
Um... 
yeah? 
Eww. 
Really? 
No. 
Hmm. And women 
like that? 
They love it. 
And to think, all this time I was just walking around on them. 
Mary! 
 Dick. 
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary. 
 Oh, that's more like it. 
I want you so bad. 
You've got to escape. 
You want me to try and get away? 
 You must. 
Oh, let me go! 
Let me go! 
How's that? 
Get out! 
 What? 
If you clear the hedge, you'll be fine. 
 What is wrong with you? 
Nothing. Everything. You 
know I'll never leave you. 
Dick. 
 I've got to go now. You remember Tommy. 
Tell her about the swim team. 
 Swim team? 
Well, well, well, if it isn't the former high commander. 
It seems that I've underestimated your.. 
stupidity. 
That was your first mistake. 
Here's your second. 
Look over there. 
Where? 
What's going on? 
Dick is acting so strangely. 
Listen, Dr. Albright. 
Dick, he's got a lot of baggage. It's an internal struggle. 
Stop! 
Ha! 
Stop pulling my hair ! 
 I'll pull it if I want ! 
That poor thing. 
I didn't know. 
No, you couldn't know, 'cause he's been afraid. 
See, he's been lonely for such a long time. 
And as the years went by, he fell into despair and lost all hope. 
For what woman could ever learn to love a beast. 
Give me a second, okay? 
I'll be right back. 
Why aren't you helping him? 
 Which one? 
When I pull him up, brain him with the gnome. 
Gotcha. 
I got him, Dick! 
 Now help me get him into the chair. 
Here. . 
Tie him up good. 
Tie him down tight Which one is it? 
Tie him up, or tie him down? 
Both, Harry. 
Hurry! We've got to get him 
out of here before Mary sees him. 
What are we going to do with him? 
Let's take him to the rambler and put him in the trunk, like they do on that show, "homicide". 
"homicide"? 
"Life on the street." 
 Oh, yeah. 
Great idea. Tommy, Harry, run 
down and clean out the trunk. 
You got it. 
 All right. 
We'll be right back, sir. 
Don't be long... 
Tommy. 
Don't tire yourself out, commander. 
I want you to witness the destruction my little device wreaks on the world you love so well. 
What have you done to our toaster? 
It's not a toaster. 
It's an incubator. 
When I press this button, millions of spores will be released into the atmosphere, spawning a whole new race, a race of groveling drones. 
They will think alike and talk alike. 
At times, they'll even walk alike. 
And I will be father to them all. 
What will happen to Mary? 
 Oh, don't worry. 
I'm not using this on her. 
I'm going to take care of her personally. 
I'm going in there and putting my feet in her purse again and again and again. 
You're insane! 
And not Gallagher insane, just insane! 
We cleaned out the rambler, Dick. 
Oh! You were able to use the gray duct tape. 
Run! 
No! 
Stay...stay and witness my moment of glory. 
as I impregnate the entire population of Ohio with my demon progeny. 
Uh, even the men? 
Okay, not the men. 
Not little girls? 
 No, no, not them. 
What about elderly women? 
 I don't think so. 
What about women who are already pregnant? 
Oh shut up, all of you! 
Okay, so, apparently, I won't be impregnating the entire population of Ohio, but all fertile women of childbearing age who are not currently pregnant, and that's a lot. 
We're talking lots of women here who will soon find themselves now pregnant by me. 
It's as easy as one... 
two... 
three. 
Yes ! 
Yes, that will show him. 
Not that I care...but er.. 
show who? 
Your father, that unfeeling purple tube who gave you life but wouldn't give you love. 
You know nothing of my father. 
So why don't you just shut up? 
'Cause you don't know him. 
You don't have to defend him. 
You can't change the past. 
You have to live in the now. 
This is the '90s, girlfriend. 
All I ever wanted was approval. 
Is it any wonder I wet my bed? 
I'm with you. 
Your father's got you all caught up in his emotional red tape, and you need to cut yourself free. 
What would you say if I told you that your father was here tonight? 
Come on out! 
What? 
I'm just kidding. 
He's not really here. 
I think you need to go home and face him. 
Let the cycle of pain end here. 
You're so right! 
That's it. 
Let it out. 
Let it all out. 
Hey, guys. 
 Dennis, what are you doing here? 
Long story. 
I got a weird vibe from you guys yesterday. 
Something wrong? 
We could have used you about an hour ago. 
What happened? 
I got mobbed by all these people. 
I gotta find a better disguise. 
Why don't you try women's clothing? 
Tried it. 
Doesn't work. 
Dennis, could you do us a favour? 
Could you escort that guy back to the home world? 
Why not? I'm going that way anyway. 
I've got a present for the big giant head. 
What is it? 
Big giant nose ring. 
Come on, come on. 
Thank you, all. 
I feel that I've made a big breakthrough here. 
Well, remember... 
nobody's going to respect you, until you learn to respect yourself. 
Bed wetter. 
And, Dennis, could you dispose of this while you're at it? 
You did it! 
You did it! 
Oh, no, not just me, lieutenant. 
I had a little help from my friends. 
 Oh, stop. 
Ricki lake, jerry springer, and Sally Jessy. 
Now listen up, everyone. 
I know that in the past I worried that we watch too much television. 
Well, all I can say is, god bless television and the many ways in which television enriches our lives. 
From now on, I order you to watch more television than ever before. 
aye, aye, sir! 
What are we waiting for? 
Tommy call the hut and get a pizza Harry, warm up that television. 
You got it. 
....and, Sally, 
go get yourself a decent pair of pants. 
Oh thank you, sir. 
Dr. Albright, the last time we were out here, 
you said something to me didn't you?. 
You cared about me. 
Is that still true? 
Of course it's true. 
Because over the last couple of days, you've seen me at my worst. 
That's what being together is about. 
If we're going to have a relationship, I want to have it with all of you, and that includes the dark side. 
You know, I care about you, too. 
You've made that very clear. 
So what do we do now? 
Well, it's been a long night, but why don't you just put your arm around me, and we'll look up at the stars? 
The stars, yes. 
They look like lovers locked in a celestial embrace. 
Why don't you just look at those trees? 
The trees, they look like lovers, their limbs exploring and fondling each other. 
How about we look at that couple in the window? 
Wow! They're going 
at it like trees. 
Harry, is there something different about you? 
You've lost weight. 
 Nope. 
Is that a new shirt? 
 Nope. 
Oh, wait! You shaved off your beard. 
 Nope. I never had one. 
It's something. 
You got a haircut. 
You're getting warmer. 
Dick, I need a favour. 
 Uh, not now, Tommy. 
I'm doing research. I'm finding out 
what happens when the spit hits the fan. 
No, Dick, look, this is important. 
Take a look at this. 
 Actors on acting? 
Yeah. You know how you're 
always trying to find new ways to explore the human feelings? 
Ah, "Using Your Emotional Memory", "The search for emotional truth will stimulate your emotional juices". 
"Emotional juices"? 
I love my juices. 
This is exciting! 
Yeah, I knew you'd like it, that's why I volunteered you to direct our school play. 
Me, direct? As in, control? 
 Yeah, it's Romeo and Juliet. 
August wants to play Juliet, and if you direct, you can cast me as Romeo. 
I'll do it! 
That's so great, 'cause there are some major make-out scenes. 
And also some really powerful emotional stuff. 
I get to die. 
I can just see it now on the Marquee.. 
"Dick Solomon directs a Dick Solomon production of Dick Solomon's Romeo and Juliet." 
Yeah, whatever. 
 Hmm. 
"Naturally, an actor must play the truth of the scene, and not indulge in emotion for its own sake." 
Well, anyone knows that. 
I didn't know you were interested in acting. 
Well, yes I am, but what I really want to do is direct. 
I'm not saying that I couldn't act. 
I could be very convincing. 
Light comedy.. 
horror.. 
tragedy. 
Morning. 
 Look, Mary! 
I'm distraught! 
Or am I? 
Okay. You have a registered letter. 
 Oh, what is it? 
Damn, damn, damn, damn! 
I owe fifteen hundred dollars in parking tickets. 
So they finally caught up with you. 
Guess I'll have to dip into my savings. 
Oh, no, no, I couldn't bear to let you do that. I'll pay them. 
You will? 
 No. I'm acting! 
Lo, and resolve itself Dick! 
Dick, guess what? 
Ms. Dubcek's give me 
all her old junk. 
Yeah, I've got some friends dropping by I haven't seen in 10 years, and I'm cleaning out the place. 
There's some really great stuff in here. 
Dr. Solomon, 
if you want to come down, I'll let you rummage through my tchotchkes. 
 Oh, I'm.. 
I'm flattered Mrs. Dubcek, but 
I think of you more as a friend. 
What are you watching? 
 Oh, it's Hamlet with Lawrence Oliver. 
I've watched it three times already. 
Huh.. I like the way 
he makes his voice go up and down like that. 
 I know. 
It makes everything he says sound so... 
fruity? 
No, important! 
 Oh. 
Hey, guys. You still 
watching that stuff? 
It's not "stuff," it's Hamlet. 
Yeah, but why do they have to talk that way? I can't follow the story. 
Hamlet? The story is as old as time. 
Pretty-boy son has a rich daddy and a good-looking mommy. 
The uncle knocks off daddy, marries mommy, and he cuts pretty boy out of the action. 
So junior goes crazy and he kills them all. 
Not a pretty story, but there it is. 
Isn't that the plot to the lion king? 
Oh, please! 
I need your help, Don. I'm in a bit of a scrape. 
 Figures. 
Dames like you always attract trouble. 
I got another parking ticket. 
Can you fix it, Don, or... 
am I leaning too hard? 
Go ahead and lean, baby. 
Don'll make the ticket go away. 
What? 
You can make parking tickets disappear? 
Of course he can. Don 
has connections downtown. 
Why..I have a friend who has 
some parking tickets. 
I can't always.. 
 Don can fix it, right? 
Well, uh.. 
 Right? 
Sure. 
 Oh, this is just great! 
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mary. 
Some of you will not be cast. 
Those will be the lucky ones. 
Over the long and grueling rehearsal period, I will be your director, your teacher, your mentor, your mother, your father, your lover! 
My assistant, Nina, will read your names. 
Nina? 
 Okay, um, Timothy Mafferty.. 
he's reading Mercutio. 
"True, I talk of dreams, which.. 
yes, yes, yes, of course. 
But have you tried it like this? 
Make your voice go high, and then suddenly bring it down. 
Here. "True, I speak of 
dreams which are but children of an idle brain, begot of nothing but vain fan... 
...tasies. 
From now on, I want everyone to try to speak that way. 
Oh, and use your hands a lot. 
We're acting. 
Remember that. 
He was touched by an anvil. 
Remind me never to ask you for another favour again. 
You weren't right for the role. 
 Hey, How'd the audition go? 
I lost the part. The director 
didn't think I was good enough. 
You were good. You had 
delivery, presence, timing. 
You just didn't have that indefinable something extra. 
I was just trying to score some points with my girlfriend. Is that too much to ask? 
Romeo and Juliet is a Shakespearian tragedy, and has nothing to do with a horny teenager and his girlfriend. 
Go ahead, Dr. Albright. 
Hello, Don. Dr. Solomon thought you 
might be able to help me with this. 
Well, I have been known to bend a few.. 
You have fifteen hundred dollars in fines. 
And, "Poof", they're gone. 
I can't "Poof" this many tickets. 
One more, and she'd be in handcuffs. 
I was going to pay them. 
 What happened? 
I didn't. 
Well, maybe if you got a lenient judge, he might reduce the fine. 
Your court date is on the 27th. 
Twenty-seventh.. oh. 
Judge Debelko. 
Sounds bad. Is it bad? 
 It's bad. 
You'd be better off with Judge Conti. 
Now, when I go to court, should I apologise to Judge Conti or just show some remorse? 
Actually, it might be helpful if you'd show some cleavage. 
He can't be serious. 
 Trust me. 
We're gonna paint your face and hike your puppies. 
I know what I'm doing, right Don? 
"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou" yes, yes. 
Very lovely. 
Darling, what are you playing? 
Fear, love, lust? 
Because the audience is playing boredom. 
I'm playing Juliet, and it's really hard for me to concentrate when you.. 
Props? Where's props? 
What? 
This candlestick is 18th-century English. 
Shakespeare was English. 
 True. 
But the play is set in Verona. 
Please, Tommy, I'm struggling to wring a performance out of this ragtag company of mannequins from the junior miss department. 
I can't do your job too. In the 
future I suggest you leave it lay. 
Now, everyone watch once again as I act out the play in its entirety. 
Nina, Nina, read me in. 
Curtain rises. 
A big, pompous blowhard flounces on to the stage. 
Listen, I'm really sorry you had to be the prop guy, 'cause, you know, if you were cast as romeo, we could have done some serious making out. 
We.. we could make out 
right now. 
With the prop guy? 
Ha! Sorry. 
Hey, what you making? 
An authentic renaissance sleeping potion. 
Now I just have to find an 15th-Century Italian vial. 
Oh, Well, I find Galileo "Vile". 
Well, this is the final box. 
I am beat. 
 Oh, thank you. You want some juice? 
Oh, please. I'll have to introduce 
you to my friends when they drop by. 
They're lovely, very nice. 
There's Diane and her husband..and Jimmy. 
Jimmy's an old flame. I 
knew he'd come back for more. 
Come back for more what? 
I said, "come back for more what"? 
What happened? 
Oh, great! You let her drink the prop? 
Well, at least we know it works. 
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give. 
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
You are Lady Capulet. 
Your kinsman Tybalt has been killed! He's dead! 
You're asking for justice, not extra pickles on your happy burger. Justice! 
You're supposed to act! 
Now bleed! Just act! Now act! 
I can't act, Dr. Solomon. 
 Yes, you can! 
I can't.. 
I can't act. 
Do your lines. 
Now, now! 
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give. 
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. 
I want everyone to take a good look at Cheryl, because Cheryl, is an actor. 
Hello? 
Damn it, voice mail. 
Hello, Dr. Albright? 
This is sergeant.. 
this is a friend.. 
with a message. 
Don't come to court today. 
There's been a change in plans. 
Next, Dr. Mary Albright? 
Here your honour. 
Sally, didn't you get my messages? 
What messages? 
They switched judges. 
I've been calling all morning. 
You're charged with fifteen hundred dollars in outstanding fines. 
How do you plead? 
All I can say is I'm so sorry, and I throw myself on the mercy of the court. 
Really. 
Dr. Albright, will you 
please approach this bench? 
You have a very big bench. 
I don't know what this little charade is about. 
We're trying to influence you. 
 Sergeant, please remove that woman. 
Doesn't he know who you are? 
You have a gun, Don! Use it! 
Dr. Albright, you "have" 
influenced this court. 
Really? 
I am fining you the full amount, plus court costs, plus five hundred dollars for contempt. 
Next. 
But your honour.. 
 Next. 
Thank you so much! 
The one time that I can help the woman I love, and your friend Don falls through! 
It was just an ironic twist of fate. Don't blame Don. 
I don't want you hanging around that police station any more, you hear me? 
Fine, I'll go to his place. 
 Oh, no, you won't. 
Oh, yes, I will! 
You hold it right there, I'm not finished with you yet. 
Oh, uh, hey, Mrs. Dubcek, 
would you mind.. 
My god, she's dead! 
Oh, what is it? 
Oh, her. 
She's not dead. 
 But she's cold. She's not breathing. 
Oh, you guys. 
She's fine. 
She drank the potion. 
The sleeping potion? 
From Romeo and Juliet? 
Well, guess we can take her downstairs until she comes to. 
Here, Harry, get her feet. 
Sally, help with the door. 
Hi, baby, it's us! 
Hi! 
 Get her inside! Get her inside! 
Who are those people? 
Oh, well, um, it's Diane, and her husband and Jimmy, an old flame coming back for more. 
This is just great! 
Didn't you make an antidote? 
Hmm, is there one in the play? 
If they see her like this, the spit is really gonna hit the fan. 
What are we gonna do? 
 Wait! I have a brilliant idea. 
Harry, did you know that in a theater of Shakespeare's day the women's roles were played by men? 
 Really? 
Yeah, and they also tied up bears and threw rocks at 'em. 
It's the role of a lifetime Harry, an actor's dream. 
Come on, let's get her in the bathroom. 
 I don't want to! 
Dick, you can't pass Harry off as Mrs. Dubcek! They'll know! 
Ah! You forget, they 
haven't seen her in over 10 years. 
Besides, Harry has a secret weapon. 
 What? 
A great director! 
Hello? 
Anybody home? 
Uh, no, nobody's here. Why don't 
we go into the living room, okay? 
Yeah, this way. Right, 
move along. Faster. 
Okay, right there. 
Why don't you take a seat, make yourself comfortable? 
I can't believe she got somebody to pay rent for this crap-hole. 
Yeah, every month. 
 Yeah, and we just love Mrs. Dubcek. 
 Ohh. 
Even more since the accident. 
"Accident"? 
Yes. Changed her, considerably. 
Uh, and, uh, she refused the estrogen therapy, yeah. 
But don't mention it to her. 
She's very sensitive. 
Is there a bathroom around.. 
 No! 
We use the one at the gas station. 
 Yeah. 
Excuse me. I'll be right back. 
Talk to them. 
What is taking so long? 
Whoa, mama! 
Do you mind? An 
actor needs time to prepare. 
Dick, I don't think I can do this. 
It's show time! Now, let's go. 
Oh, and Harry, remember, you're going out there a youngster, but you're coming back a star Now let's go. 
Mamie honey! 
Well, I see you've met my tenants. 
Oh, uh, we love Mrs. Dubcek. 
Hi, Mamie. 
 Lovely tattoo. Very nice. 
I don't blame you for being distant, not after what we went through. 
She and Jimmy used to be engaged. 
Oh, you're Jimmy! 
She mentioned you just the other evening. 
I just wanted to say thanks, for kicking me out all those years ago. 
That was the wake-up call that finally got me off the sauce. 
Aww! 
 That's so sweet. 
Forgive me? 
Sure. 
Stop it, stop it, stop it! 
I'm sorry. She had 
something crawling up her chin. 
Why don't you all go downstairs, and, uh, get reacquainted? 
Mrs. Dubcek, 
there we are. 
Bye, bye, now. Bye, bye. Bye, bye, now. 
Manhandle me again, and you'll answer to Jimmy. 
We are breathing. 
We are breathing. 
All right! 
Which one of you jamokes is Solomon? 
That would be I. 
 You're out. 
Out? Who are you? 
 I'm coach Mafferty. 
My wife's with the P.T.A. 
And there's a lot of complaints that these kids are coming home with low self-esteem, and they're wetting their beds and stuff like that. 
So you're looking at the new director! 
 This is unacceptable. 
Sorry, Spielberg, you're out. 
No, no. 
Do not weep for me. 
I humbly quit the stage. 
No, no, no tears. 
The theater is a cruel Mistress. 
Adieu, adieu. 
Remember me. 
Okay kids, let's huddle up. 
Alright let's back it up to, "I pray you good Mercutio, let's retire". 
Okay, now, who's playing Mercutio? 
Uh, coach Mafferty, if I may, I think there is someone here who can play Mercutio. 
Aah! 
I am hurt! 
Aye, aye, a scratch, a scratch. 
Marriage is enough. 
'Twill serve. 
Ask for me tomorrow and you will find me a grave man. 
Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead. 
A plague o' both your houses, for they have made worms' meat... 
of me-e-e! 
Romeo.. 
 I have it, and soundly too. 
Your... houses! 
I'm dead now. 
Well, here it is.. the 
review in my high school paper. 
You've got a review? 
Ah, ha, ha ha! 
"Dick Solomon's over-the-top performance, gave new meaning to the word 'Tragedy". 
I have redefined my art, and so I retire. 
 No! 
No, no, please, please. To go any 
further would jeopardize the mission. 
Tommy, hang up my codpiece. 
Dick, I'm not your prop lackey anymore. 
Besides, as of next month, your codpiece turns into Sancho Panza's hat. 
I wonder what Don's doing? 
"Don". I never want to hear the name 
"Don" mentioned in this house again. 
Now, that's an order! 
Hi, there. 
What am I doing on the roof? 
Don't you know, we were about to ask you the same thing. 
You should be inside, Mrs. Dubcek, let us help you. 
Oh, Don. Don? 
Why should the name "Don" make Dick so angry? 
Sally? 
 Who's there? 
I would tell you, but my name is so offensive to your family, I dare not speak it aloud. 
Don, if they found you, there's no telling what they'd do to you. 
I'm okay. 
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes. 
And if thou love me, let them find me here. 
My life were better ended by their hate, than death prolonged wanting of thy love. 
Wow, that's so romantic. 
Ah, well, I wrote it myself. 
I've asked you back here for a reason. 
You seem like an intelligent woman, so I'm going to make you an offer. 
I will lower the fines, remove the contempt charge, and eliminate the court costs on one condition. 
You have to promise me that you will spend the weekend with me at a hotel in Chicago. 
The Ambassador East? 
 The Sheraton. 
No. 
Oh, hi, Nina. 
Would you stand up on the desk and adjust that vent? 
It's blowing right in my face. 
Uh, yeah. I'll get 
to that real soon. 
Until then, you just do it yourself. 
Fair enough. 
Oh hi, Dick. Would you adjust my vent? 
With Nina in the room? 
Get up on the desk and adjust my vent. 
Oh, of course. Nina, please leave the room. 
 No problem. 
I can't reach it from here. 
Put your foot on the chair. 
Are you sure? 
It's.. it's wobbly. 
Well, I'll hold it down. 
 Well, all right. 
A little further. 
 Okay. 
Ah, there, how's that? 
 Hold on, I'll check. 
My foot! 
My foot! 
Oh, I'm so sorry! 
I'm so sorry! 
It should have been you! 
It should have been you! 
That should do it, Dr. Solomon. 
Well, that's unbelievable. 
I feel no pain. 
Well you may feel some discomfort when the shock wears off. 
No. Obviously, the fall has 
made me impervious to pain. 
You should go home and try to stay off your foot as much as possible. 
Keep it elevated, keep ice on it. 
Just use good judgment. 
I have excellent judgment. 
Yep. 
In fact, Nina, hand me the staple gun. 
Call me if you need me. 
Oh, thank you, doctor. 
I'Il take him home right now. 
I can drive myself. 
 Oh! Don't be silly! It's the least I can do. 
I'll take you home, come back here, pick up my car, go to the drug store, the grocery store, pick up anything you need. 
Okay. 
 I'll just bring the car around, okay? 
Wha.. why is she 
doing this? 
Sit back and relax. 
You're in pain, she knows she caused it, she feels guilty. 
Wha.. why should she 
be guilty? I'm not in pain. 
I have a superhuman threshold for pain. 
And wha-lah! 
Harry? 
I'm in my room! 
This isn't a room. This is a 
shower curtain in a hall way. 
Is that so? Then why 
are my linens here? 
Because your linens fell off the washing machine. 
I'm sick of sleeping on the washing machine. 
Oh, sure, a vibrating bed impresses the ladies... 
but I want my own room! Dick 
said that I could have one. 
No. Dick said that under no 
circumstances could you have your own room. 
Let's not quibble over semantics. 
Besides, you guys have your own rooms. 
I sleep in a storage space behind Dick's chimney. 
And my room is an uninsulated alcove overlooking a toilet. 
Room with a view... 
rub it in. 
Harry, you can't sleep in the hallway! 
Home wrecker! 
What's wrong?! 
She hurt me! 
 It was an accident! 
Oh an accident? 
We can make accidents happen too, lady. 
Here, let me elevate that foot. 
No touching! 
No touching! 
Ooh, what did my body ever do to deserve this? 
What did I ever do to you?! 
Mary, turn it off! 
Well I can't. The doctor said he 
doesn't give drugs for a sprain. 
But that's good news, isn't it? It's not broken. 
Well I heard sometimes a sprain can be worse than a break. 
Oh, is that one worse?! 
 Yes, it is! Much worse! 
Well, I said I was sorry! 
Can I fix you something to eat? 
Just fix my foot! I don't care 
if I starve, just fix my foot! 
I.. I'll get you 
some ice. 
Look at my foot. 
It's one big boo-boo. 
Dick, you sound pretty pathetic. 
Is it pathetic to sprain your foot, worse than anybody ever in the history of the world. Sally! 
Sorry, Dick. But you know 
nothing about earth pain until you've been a woman, okay? 
One week every month, I feel like I got a pair of pliers in my pants. 
You got a boo-boo? I'm in 
the national guard of pain. 
What was I thinking? I am 
so stupid! I am so stupid! 
Mary seems to understand my pain. 
Dick? 
I too understand your pain. 
It's right here. 
Ah, crespin, two boxes? 
Rupsin, johnny, one box. 
Solomon? 
Fifteen? 
You really think you can sell fifteen boxes of chocolate? 
Sell? 
That's right. 
After school, on the weekends.. 
until every bar of chocolate is sold. 
No one's gonna wanna buy this crap! 
It doesn't even have raisins! 
I'll give you raisins. 
 Or Nougat! 
I'm gonna nougat you, Solomon! 
What do I get for selling this crap? 
You get the satisfaction of helping to pay to send the band to Washington! 
Now how's that for compensation?! 
 Oh, all right, cool. 
That's that. 
I'm Gonna practise some ball passing. 
I want half of you over there, half of you over there, the other half come with me. 
I brought you some soup. 
Let me just fix this foot here. 
Eat your soup. 
 Okay. 
Mmm, this tastes sumptuous. 
My mother used to make this soup for me whenever I .. 
Did she always serve it this cold? 
I'll heat it up some more. 
 Thank you, Mary. 
Thank you. 
Is something wrong? 
 Oh... 
no, but, could you also get me some crackers? 
Sure. 
Are you okay? 
 Oyster crackers? 
Mary, I just wanted to say, I'm so happy that it was you who hurt me so horribly. 
All right. I'll be right back 
with your soup and crackers. 
Oyster crackers! 
My god! 
I have a magic foot! 
Sally, what are you doing? 
 Eating your soup. 
Well, you can't do that! 
 It's not that terrible. 
You put a bunch of oyster crackers in it, you can barely taste it. 
Don't eat all of these! 
Dick is lying in there hurt. 
Well I'm fine and I'm hungry. Besides, 
I'm not the one who broke his foot. 
Sprained. 
Have a little compassion, Sally. 
We're healthy. 
We have to help him. 
I say he's lame. 
Shoot him. 
And wha-lah! 
Harry, what are you doing in here? 
Dancing to the natural sounds of plumbing. 
Okay, well, get out 'cause I've got to use the bathroom. 
You can't kick me out of my own room! 
Okay, pilgrim. 
It's your funeral. 
Oh, dear god! 
No, no, no, no, no! 
Hi, my name's Tommy Solomon. 
I'm selling chocolate bars to send the high school band to Washington. 
Hey, fat guy! Is this a dream or what?! 
Candy door to door.. 
Hi, father. 
I'm trying to sell these chocolate bars, so the high school band can go to Washington. 
And learn about Christianity. 
And... become priests. 
Fine then. 
They'll stay here in Rutherford and worship Satan! 
Now this is what I call a room. 
I've got everything a man could need. 
A piece of plywood, the gnome, a very thin blanket, no food, and my new friend, the crow. 
Hi neighbour! 
Not exactly the house warming gift I hoped for. 
But you can't pick your neighbours. 
Tommy, make me a sandwich. 
You have a sandwich right there. 
I know, but Mary cut it in half, and not diagonally, and that hurts my foot. 
Well, you can chalk it up to me being a teenager, but I just don't care. 
Mary won't be back from the colouring book store for half an hour. 
You know, this day has been hell! 
I think I met one nice guy all day. 
Well, how many bars did he buy? 
Oh, none. But he sold me 
this nice set of encyclopedias. 
Tommy? 
Tommy, it's an emergency! 
I need the remote! 
Sally. 
Sally. 
God, what? 
 I can't reach the remote. 
It's right there! 
 But I can't get to it, Sally. 
So?! 
 Oh, lieutenant Do you know what it's like to feel helpless? 
To be robbed of your freedom by an injury? 
To be a burden on your family? 
Oh, god, how you must hate me! 
I'm.. experiencing 
the strangest sensation. 
I feel bad that you feel bad and.. 
even though I know it'll be annoying, I just can't seem to fight it. 
Dick, can I get you anything?! 
Make me a sandwich and cut it diagonally. 
Okay. 
Oh, you forgot the remote! 
My foot! 
It's better! 
No! 
Go on, doctor. 
Give it to me straight. 
The ankle looks great. 
Are you sure? 
 Yes, you're all better. 
Don't you think you should break it and set it again just to make sure it heals properly? 
No. 
Doctor, you don't understand. 
The moment I sprained that foot, my life went from VCR to VCR plus! 
You've got to help me! 
Dick? 
The ankle is healed. 
I won't be treated this way by your heartless H.M.O. 
I demand control of my treatment options! 
Because it's not the length of our time here that matters, it's the quality of our lives! 
And if you're not qualified to break my foot, then by god, I'll find a doctor who will! 
So you're telling me that in this colourful, monochrome wrapper is a bar of chocolate? 
 That's right. 
Delicious chocolate. 
Now, how far would you walk for a bar of chocolate? 
To get a bar of chocolate, or at the request of a bar of chocolate? 
To get. 
 Oh, 53 miles. 
Well, now you can have chocolate in your own home. 
In my own home?! 
That's right. Now, how much 
would you pay for that? 
For my own home, or for a bar of chocolate? 
Bar of chocolate. 
 Ah.. 
Well, we tried. 
Excuse me, my friend hurt his leg. 
Could you help us out and buy a chocolate bar? 
Oh, Nina... 
I can't tell you how good it is to be among people who brush their own teeth. 
You're not brushing his teeth? 
Do I have any messages? 
One o'clock, Dr. Solomon called. He 
wants to know where you are. 
Oh, god. 
 1.05, Dr. Solomon called again. 
His foot feels hot. Doesn't know if 
that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
1.12, Dr. Solomon called. He's hungry. 
Can you make him a personal pan pizza? 
1.17. Dr. Solomon called. 
Wants to know if you've forgotten that you were the one that hurt his foot. 
Hello? 
No, you have the wrong number. 
Oh, your foot hurts? 
Have you tried hitting it with a hammer? 
I've cold called, I've direct mailed. 
I can't afford a pay-per-view special.  Nothing works. 
This isn't my problem, buddy. 
Well, just help out an incredibly screwed kid and buy a chocolate bar. 
If I bought every stupid thing that came to my door.. 
Tommy, forget it. 
The guy's not buying anything. 
..I'd be living up to my pledge to 
help every kid who came to my door. 
Cash or check? 
 How 'bout both? 
Oh, come on! 
That is just so cheap! 
God! 
I really want some candy! 
What is that? 
 93.9, the wave. 
The best of the '70s, '80s and today. 
Well, I know what it is, but where is it coming from? 
From my new tree entertainment system! 
Oh, look! 
The squirrels are getting it on to Marvin Gaye. 
So it's nice up there? 
 Only the best room in the house. 
See you later, Dick. 
 But.. but.. 
wha.. wha.. 
oh, Sally? 
Thank god you're here. 
You know how I hate asking for your help, but could you just please do me this one little favour? 
 What? 
I want to see Harry's cool tree house. Carry me? 
No way. 
Oh, please, Sally? 
There's so little joy in my life. 
 No. 
But Sally, I ask you for so little! 
Can you just once.. 
 No! 
You're right. 
What good is a tree house visit when death is only moments away? 
What? 
 Tonight's meal may be my last. 
And you know what that means? 
Mexican night! 
I think I hate you, Dick. 
Tommy, Harry! We gotta go back to the store! 
It's Mexican night! 
 Oh great! 
You know what is so weird, Dick? 
I don't know if it's, uh, what you're saying or... 
how you're saying it, but, um... 
all that stuff that used to make me want to help you, well, now it's just pissing me off! 
Oh, and Sally? 
 What?! 
Corn tortillas, not flour. 
Si, Se�or. 
No way! 
You guys! 
You gotta see this! 
Ohh, I should have known. 
What are you looking at? 
That bastard! 
There goes Mexican night. 
 Oh, it's Mexican night all right. 
Mexican prison night. 
I say we stick a bucket on his head, and whack him with a bat like a pi�ata and we don't stop till candy comes out! 
Tommy, Harry, let's go! 
 Wait a minute, Sally! 
What about me? He's taken 
advantage of me worse than any of you. 
He made me cut up his food and feed it to him. 
He made me sing to his foot! 
He made me take his temperature... 
the hard way. 
Besides, I don't think you have what it takes to get even. 
I have a metal bucket and three softball bats. 
That's a pretty good start. 
Ooh, oh. Hi. 
The, uh.. the ladder 
appears to be disconnected. 
Funny how that happened, eh? 
That must be painful up there on that ladder with that terrible, terrible sprain. 
Ah, yeah...It.. it hurts a lot. 
Hey, Dick, how did you get up there? 
Well, uh... 
you know how it is. 
No, tell us. 
 Could one of you just, uh... 
grab the end of the ladder and pull it in? 
Gee, I don't know. 
It's awfully far. My arms hurt 
Well... 
why don't you let me down and I'll have a look at them? 
Admit it, Dick! 
You're a liar! 
you manipulated us! 
You tortured us! 
It just happened! 
It's nobody's fault! 
Okay, okay, okay! 
It's my fault. 
You fortitude just felt so good. 
So appropriate. 
I'm sorry. 
That's better. 
Wow, now that's gotta hurt. 
Not as much as that. 
All right! 
Everybody line up into a circle. 
Solomon! 
 Sorry I'm late, coach. 
Hey, anybody who can sell 15 boxes of chocolate in my class can be a little tardy. 
What's your secret, champ? 
Well, you know I... 
kept thinking about sending the band to Washington. 
Well, they're gonna owe you some real thanks when they get back next week. 
Well..they're coming back? 
Well, yeah. 
All right, which one of you tools sold enough chocolate to buy them a return ticket?! 
Eh? Hey, you look at me when 
I'm talking to you! Come here! 
Guilt is like a belly button that doesn't even collect lint. 
It's a wasted emotion that just nags and nags and nags and nags.. 
until Dick falls out of the tree. 
Maybe guilt is some kind of ancient guidance system. 
A stealth emotion designed to make people help each other out even if they don't want to. 
If I could just break that code, I could get you all to serve me. 
You don't need guilt to get anyone to serve you. 
We proved that when we were selling candy. 
All you need to do is remind people they like sex. 
Oh. Wouldn't it be scary if 
sex and guilt were connected? 
Sex and guilt connected! 
Harry, you're an idiot! 
 I know. 
Dick, I've been watching TV and I think you can walk without these crutches. 
No, I can't. 
This man says that he cannot walk, but I say that he can. 
I say I feel the spirit in Dick Solomon. 
Now stand up and walk. 
 But my foot is broken. 
Oh, foot's broken. 
Those are just words! 
Now deep inside and walk, my brother! 
Walk! 
 Aah! 
Stay in bed, my brother. 
Stay in bed. 
Oh, my god! 
Aliens are not like that. 
Oh, the senseless violence. 
The mindless gore. 
The incredible sound system. 
There must have been 30 speakers in that place. That movie kicked butt. 
How can you say that? 
They portrayed aliens as vicious monsters. 
They blew up the department of transportation. 
Do you mind? We haven't seen the movie yet. 
What do I care? I don't even know you. 
Don't you think it was cool when that thing's tongue split open and strangled those eight army guys? 
Okay, that was cool... 
 Yeah. 
But only that, and only because it made me scream like a little girl. 
They have to make the aliens scary. That's entertainment. 
Sucking the brains out of all those zoo animals is not entertainment. 
Hey, up there, shut up! 
Hey, quiet. 
It's how these people think of us. 
They didn't care whether the aliens were good or bad. They wanted them dead. 
What am I going to do? Mary.. 
she's already seen this movie. 
So? She doesn't know 
you're an alien. Does she? 
Oh, please. 
Does she? 
I said, "oh, please." 
Isn't that enough? 
Does she? 
No! 
Attention, ticket holders! 
Listen up. At the end of the movie, 
when the president turns out to be an alien.. 
and he barbecues all the congressmen, don't believe it because aliens hate barbecue. 
If you don't shut up, I'm going to kill you. 
 All Righty. 
And that goes for all of you. 
 Did you hear that guy? 
He hasn't seen the movie, and he already wants to kill us. 
We are in big trouble here. 
We've got to lay low until this mania passes over. 
Maybe build a bunker. 
No! We can't hide. 
I say we come out of the bunker and into the street. 
I say we hold an alien pride parade. 
We'll all get together, and we'll prove that we're all.. 
humans. 
Hello. 
"Rutherford bugle"? 
I'd like to speak to your film critic, please. 
Oh. Well, then, will you tell him 
that I just saw "Dawn of the Aliens, and it was not wham-bam? 
It was not a slam dunk. I was 
never on the edge of my seat. 
And the special effects did not make my eyes pop out. 
There's no cream in here! 
Well, you don't have to bite my head off. 
Nina, we don't do that. 
Hello, Dick. 
Oh, Mary. 
You notice how I'm being gentle and not squeezing your body until your spleen shoots out of your mouth? 
Yes, I noticed that. 
Thank You. 
Oh! Speaking of spleens, 
did you see "Dawn of the Aliens"? 
Wasn't that movie great? 
It was two hours and four minutes of horrible, horrible lies. 
I liked it. 
 Me, too. I was on the edge of my seat. 
They portray aliens as hideous, evil mutants. 
Why can't they be sweet and well-mannered? 
I don't pay seven bucks to see an alien play with a puppy. 
At that price he better eat it. 
Tommy? 
Tommy, They're having a sci-fi convention in Cleveland. 
"Meet all the aliens from your favourite Tv shows and movies. 
And 'Star Trek's' Mr. Sulu, George Takei, 
will be signing copies of his new book, 'Warp Speed, Damn It: The complete rants of William Shatner". 
This would be a perfect place to help people understand how wrong their impressions of us aliens are. 
Or we could just blow the whole damn place up. 
Would you guys lift your feet, please? 
Lift your feet. 
Lift feet! 
What's your problem? 
Sally, turn off your sucking device. 
What is it? 
I need your support. I've 
made the most difficult decision I've had to make since coming to this planet. 
You're giving up tighty whities and switching to boxers? 
Nooooooo! 
It's not about underwear, Harry, although I have switched. 
I've decided to tell Mary that I am what humans would call, in their galactocentric way, an alien. 
No..are you crazy? Why are you doing this? 
You've never blown your cover on any other mission. 
I've never felt the need to. 
I keep having these feelings. 
It's this fleshy human slipcover. 
Oh, sure, it's dashing, tall, manly, washable, but somehow it just makes me feel so awful about deceiving the woman I love. 
All right, look. Let's just 
think this thing through, okay? 
I'll be her. Here I am. 
I'm Mary, sitting at my desk. 
Now, you come in and tell me. 
Hello, Mary. 
Dick. 
You look handsome today. 
And you look more beautiful than ever. 
All right. Let's just start over. 
Hello, Mary. 
 Dick! 
I can't kiss you today because I've got the flu. 
As do I. 
Mary, I am an alien. 
She's dead! 
You killed her, you alien bastard! 
Why? 
Why? 
This is nonsense! I'm going to tell her. 
You're going to get us all killed. 
I'm only telling one person. 
Sir, as security officer, I forbid. 
And, as high commander, I have to say tough toenails, lieutenant. 
Fine. Let it be on your head. 
Which is going to be sitting next to ours on a tray somewhere in new Mexico. 
I am telling you, humans cannot handle this kind of information. 
Mary can. 
I just have to find the right setting, the right atmosphere where the elegant beauty of our magnificent surroundings help her to embrace the truth and me. 
They're having a sci-fi convention in Cleveland. 
Perfect! 
Pack your bags, kids. 
We're going on a road trip. 
Sweet. 
Ooh! - Oh! - Ahh! 
Look at this place. 
Our first hotel room. 
Wow! Why do I suddenly have the urge 
to trash it? 
Hey, you guys, look at this tiny bottle I found in the bathroom. 
Evidence of a superior race of tiny people. 
How can you tell they're superior? 
Because it's a shampoo and conditioner in one. 
A tiny fridge. 
Filled with tiny bottles of alcohol, and tiny bags of macadamia nuts! 
These people might be tiny, but they know how to party. 
How do they get up on the bed, especially when they're all drunk and fat on nuts? 
Just tell me when. 
When. 
When I've poured enough to slake your thirst for champagne. 
When. 
Whenever your heart desires. 
When, stop, now. 
Now? 
Yeah, yes, now, now! 
Half a bottle for one glass. 
You are a wild woman, but then I accept that. 
I may be wild, but I'm not going to bite. 
And neither will I, and that's the whole point. 
There will be no biting, no bloodletting, no cranial explosions. 
What's with you? 
All right, Mary, you've sniffed me out. 
I brought you here under the guise of a romantic holiday to tell you something about myself. 
This is very difficult. 
I don't want you to judge me. 
I never judge you. 
Sometimes I do. 
Often. 
Always. I'll try not to this time. 
Mary, before I met you, I was completely different. 
I was far, far away from here. 
And ever since I left that place, I've been fighting so hard to fit in. 
And if ever anyone found out, I'd have to go back because I could never live in this world any longer. 
Oh, Dick, were you in a... "Clinic"? 
Clinic? 
 It's okay. 
So was I. 
Oh! 
Wake up, everybody! 
We're going to the sci-fi convention. 
What's so important about this sci-fi convention? 
Don't you see? 
It's a perfect opportunity to take a stand, to protest how the rest of the world is treating our kind. 
You want to be some kind of alien Martin Luther king? 
Exactly, because I, too, have a dream, and in that dream I'm naked on a ferris wheel. 
I'll meet you guys in the lobby. 
I'm going to go make sure Dick hasn't blown our cover. 
Sally, there's a note for you on the door. 
"Please make up room". 
All right, I'll do it when we get back. 
We're going to the sci-fi convention! 
I've never told anyone this before, but when I was a little girl.. nine, 10... 
17.. 
I was fat. 
How fat? 
Fat enough that everybody made fun of me. 
Fat as a cow? 
Is that how fat? 
That's not important. 
 Right, sorry. You go on. 
Anyway, instead of reaching out for help, I.. 
I turned inward and became bitter and disillusioned with the world around me. 
300 pounds? 400.. 
 Dick! 
Sorry. 
My parents just made it worse. 
They had this notion that I was going to be an Olympic figure skater. 
They forced me into a leotard. 
I looked like a sausage in purple velour casing. 
And when I skated, they called me the Zamboni. 
Then one day I.. 
I cracked. 
The ice? 
 Mentally! 
I cracked mentally. 
 Mentally, yes. 
My parents sent me to a special place.. 
camp knockalot of-Weight-off. 
Mary, that is just terrible. 
I'm so sorry. 
Oh no, it's fine, really. 
Thanks for letting me confide in you. 
Now, why were you in a clinic? 
Oh, uh, well, funny story. 
I was, uh... 
how can I put this...Not. 
What?! 
Here goes. I am.. 
just hold that thought. 
Sally! 
I need to talk to Dick for a second, in private. 
Don't you have some little girly thing you need to do in the bathroom? 
No. 
 Then just go sit in there. 
Excuse me? 
 You're excused. 
What, uh.. 
well! 
This had better be good! 
I was this close to pouring my heart out. 
Then I arrived in time. 
She just told me one of her deepest secrets. 
She used to be fat. 
 Fat as a cow? 
That's not the point. 
The point is, she can't keep a secret. 
And you tell her, the next thing you know, the air force has sealed off the neighborhood. 
That's a risk I'm willing to take. 
Okay, how about this one? You 
tell her you're an alien, and she freaks out, runs away, and you never see her again, ever. 
Oh... 
Well..in my scenario, she 
comes running into my arms. 
Well, just a risk you're going to have to take... 
Alien. 
But it's fascinating, though, isn't it? 
 What? 
How these people fulfill their lives through fantasy. 
It's like those guys that spend all of their time reading those fake letters in "penthouse". 
They're fake? 
Can you imagine what these people would do if they met an actual alien? 
They would completely freak out. 
I don't know. In a way, aren't we all aliens? 
I mean, we emerge from weightless environments, seeing everything for the first time with curious new eyes, every emotion brand-new, always discovering, always learning. 
Yeah, you keep overthinking life. 
I'm going to get a couple of space churros. 
See? Somebody broke into the room. 
Look at this place. 
Looks clean to me. 
Exactly! 
They cleaned everything, made the beds, rewrapped the soap, sanitized the toilet for my protection. 
Look, look, look, look! 
The maid was here. 
The maid? 
There's a maid? 
Housekeeping. 
Here. It's a whole book of services 
the hotel has to offer. 
Dry cleaning, wake-Up calls, in-room dining? 
Yes, ma'am, room service. 
Room service? 
Room... 
service. 
Do you know what this means? 
No, ma'am. 
We're in heaven. 
You, my good man, are the assistant manager of heaven. 
Thank you, ma'am. 
 Byebye. 
Hi. Yes, erm... 
This is Sally Solomon in room 605. 
Can I get a turkey sandwich? 
I can? 
Can I get 10? 
Live long and prosper. 
Hailing frequencies open, everybody. I'm George Takei. 
Seeing all of you here makes me feel like a kid again, almost as if, as Mr. Sulu once said, 
my chronometer's running backwards. 
Ha! 
You people are living a lie. 
Look at yourselves, embracing negative alien stereotypes. 
Did you ever stop to think that maybe aliens are friendly, kind, attractive people? 
Uh, security? 
Hath not an Alien eyes or buttocks? 
If you prick an alien, does it not say "Ow, ow, ow"? 
We should not embrace science fiction. 
Screw sci-fi. 
Instead, we should embrace science facts.. 
"sci-fa". 
Harry, let's go now. 
Long live sci-fa. 
You there, forget the windows and scrub that sink until I see my face in it. Thanks. 
Ooh, coming! 
Good afternoon, ma'am. 
 Good afternoon. 
I'm here to pick up your dry cleaning. 
Yeah that pile on the luggage. 
Hell, do the luggage, too. 
Sally, I just feel terrible. 
Well, you're doing the right thing by not telling her, honey. 
Darling, when you're done with the bathroom, dust the credenza and fertilize the potted plants. 
I'm want 'em blooming and making me happy. 
I came here with the sole purpose of coming clean, and now I feel so dirty. 
Just take a bubble bath. 
You know, the tub's got beautifully positioned jets, and the shower turns into a sauna. 
"Dirty" was a metaphor lieutenant. 
I'm sure it was, honey. 
Hi. Yes, uh.. 
Could we get some eucalyptus oil up here, and a couple of big, fat loofahs? Thanks. 
Sally? 
 Hello, boys. 
What's all this stuff? 
Room... service. 
Room Service. 
If I want a towel, they send it up. 
If I want a radish, they send it up. 
They set up a laptop, a fax, a Vcr. And why? 
Because until checkout time tomorrow, I'm their Queen. 
I'm glad you're having a good time. 
 I am. 
I'll be down in my room. 
Are these chocolate truffles? 
Hey! Get your own 
French sampler. 
How can you look at yourself? 
Deceiving the person you love for the sake of a mission. 
Look at you. 
You're gorgeous! 
Did you say something? 
 Oh, no, nothing. 
Tell her, tell her, but how? 
Stand back, Earth man, and prepare to be demolecularized in ways you've never imagined. 
Mary? 
 I'm not Mary. 
I am uma from the planet Thurman. 
Remove your earth pants. 
Any resistance will be futile, human. 
Human. 
But I'm not human. 
I've been deceiving you. 
I'm an alien from a planet in the bard spiral galaxy on the Cepheus Draco border. 
I was sent here by our leader, the big giant head, to explore this planet. 
Dick Solomon is just a facade, hiding a quivering purple tube. 
I am the high commander, and this... 
is my salute. 
Oh, really? 
I have seen your planet. 
It is a savage place and must be conquered. 
Oh, Mary. 
Ow! 
 Ow! Oh. 
This is Harry Solomon. I'd 
like to get another massage cause I'm starting to feel a little tense again. 
Hey, look what I found. 
Oh, what is it? 
It looks like a list of everything we got while we were here. 
Lobster, lobster, lobster, lobster. 
Hey, what's that number there at the bottom? 
It's probably the population of Cleveland or something. 
That's your bill. 
Oh, my god. 
 No way. 
What are we going to do? 
Harry, get me the laptop, the modem, the magnetic strip key that got us into this room, and a shower cap. 
Good morning, Mr. Takei. 
Good morning. 
I'm checking out. 
Of course. 
Here's your bill, sir. 
Three thousand dollars Well, that's all right. 
I can afford it, I'm a famous actor. 
I'm sorry. 
That's thirty thousand dollars Mr. Takei. 
Oh, my. 
14 bottles of champagne, shrimp cocktails, hummus on pita tips? 
Look, I had a toblerone and two ginger ales. 
That's it! 
Seven massages? How 
could I get seven massages? 
Do I look relaxed? 
Do I? 
What's this? 
All right, so I took one towel. 
One towel! 
I'm George Takei, damn it! 
Come on, I want to go to the magic shop. 
Harry, Sally, go get some change. 
We'll wait here with the car. 
I got to get new sneakers. My toes 
are bursting out of these things. 
I just bought you those three months ago. 
You know you're a freak, don't you? 
Leave me alone, I'm growing. 
If it were just the growing, but for every inch you sprout, you become that much more insolent and do that much worse in school. 
So what? 
You're going to become the world's tallest idiot. 
Why are you on my case? 
I just can't stomach another of those interminable parent-teacher conferences. 
Look, I did not ask to be the teenager, okay? You made me. 
"Lone star drilling company." 
I bet they have change. 
 Yeah, oil men are rich. 
Well, check you out. 
You look just like a real woman. 
Thanks. 
That's what I was going for. 
You know, I still can't get used to those mood swings. 
Way to commit, girl. 
I'll be right back. 
Hello. 
Are you familiar with the art of illusion? 
Hi there. 
Hi there. 
Could you change a dollar? 
For you I could change anything. 
You know, I don't see a lot of men as good-looking as you. 
I don't see a lot of men as good-looking as you. 
Well, we're fabulous, aren't we? 
Oh, yeah. 
Hello, hello, you've got a visitor. 
Dr. Solomon, I'm Candace Ballard. 
Hello. What do you want? 
I'm Tommy's guidance counselor. 
And, by the way, my guidance counselor might stop by tonight. 
Didn't I tell you to become the model student? 
I did. I've aced every test. 
 Then what's she doing here? 
I don't know, I'm brilliant, not clairvoyant. 
Is it too much to ask that you just once make me a proud father? 
It's not my mission to make you proud. 
It is if I say so. 
 It is not! 
Say it's your mission. 
 No! 
Go on, say it's your mission. 
Say it, say it. 
It's my mission. 
Is everything all right? 
Everything's fine. 
 Then I'll see you la you get back in here and sit down! 
Sit down. 
 Thank you. 
Give me your coat. 
 Okay. 
How am I supposed to learn if you keep letting me out? 
Well, I have some news. 
Maybe you'd better sit down. 
Tommy scored higher on the national merit quiz than anyone in Ohio's history. 
It's not my fault! 
 That's a good thing. 
No, that's a good thing. 
You should be proud. 
You've raised a very bright boy. 
I'm sorry. 
Could you repeat that? 
You've raised a very bright boy? 
No one's ever said that to me before. Say it again. 
Well, actually, I wanted.. 
 No, just say it! 
I love that.. the bright boy part. 
Say it! Say it! 
Bright boy! 
In fact, he's done so well, I think he should transfer to the Pickney country day school for the gifted. 
Because I raised a gifted son? 
Yes! Look at what you've already given him.. 
the stimulation, the nurturing, and not to mention... 
the genes he inherited. 
You're right. 
I do give a lot as a father. 
Oh! 
Sally. 
There's something I have to tell you about your boyfriend. 
He cooks, he loves the arts, he wears great shoes, and he's single. 
Yeah, what's your point? 
Sally, marry this man. 
Tommy! 
Come in here! 
Tommy! 
Great news. 
I'm sending you to the Pickney school, where our accomplishments will be recognized. 
What?! No, I don't want to go. 
I'll have to leave all my friends. 
Stop thinking of yourself. 
Think of me and how proud I'll be. 
He'll go. 
 Wonderful. 
A little something to graze on. 
I'm out. 
I'm out of the closet. 
I love this family. 
What is Dick's problem? 
I don't want to go to the Pickney school. 
Of course you don't. 
Your father's a professor. 
By rejecting education, you're rejecting him. 
Rejection's the most powerful weapon there is. 
Well, maybe on earth. 
I know this is going to be miserable. I already hate it there. 
You know, all those brainy girls are going to be ugly. 
Are you saying that intelligent girls are, by definition, unattractive? 
Yeah, most of them are. 
Oh, well, not all of them are. 
I mean.. 
in fact, on the graph of smart girls and the graph of pretty ones, you're the sole intersection, the single point of perfection in an infinity of stupid and homely. 
Wow, you are gifted. 
You're smoking. 
I guess my body just responds to the classics. 
They're having a dance contest here next week. 
We'd be unbeatable. 
Especially if we target our key competition and sever their achilles tendons. 
What? 
You're just so great. 
You're a warrior in a world full of phonies. 
You're not afraid to be who you are. 
You're in the military, and you wear a dress. 
I just want to be all that I can be. 
You're the strongest person I've ever met. 
I know. 
Tommy, we're thrilled to have you here. 
Dr. Solomon, as a parent and 
educator, kudos to you. 
You've raised a very special boy. 
Yes, I have. 
And you've had the foresight to bring him to the right place. 
Well, I am the high commander. 
Yes. Well, 
people of brilliance can't be expected to function in a society that's run by intellectual midgets. 
That's what we always say. 
Yes, yes, you and Tommy have found a home here at the Pickney. 
It's not just for exceptional students. It's for exceptional parents. 
Then you must be delighted to meet me. 
Ah, Aramis, thanks for stopping by. 
Tommy, consider Aramis Pickney's welcome wagon. 
I'm here to show you what's wired and what's tired. 
Somebody shoot me in the head. 
Well, Dr. Menard, now 
that the children are away, let's discuss me at great length. 
Oh, hey! 
How was your day? 
Great. I am the king of Dorkopolis. 
My liege. 
Tommy. 
Lookin' good. 
Dick, feelin' stupid. 
Oh, Dick! 
You've got money in your shoes. Ooh! 
You've got money in your shoes. 
I want money shoes. 
Harry, no, money shoes are for Pickney students and Pickney parents only. 
Oh... rats. 
Tommy, look at this. 
First in your class. 
You're a genius. 
You've made me so proud, son. 
Is there anything you need? 
Money? A ride somewhere? 
Cuff links? 
Can I build you a darkroom? 
Anything you want.. name it, it's yours. 
I want to go back to my old school. 
Cuff links it is. 
Don't put bumper stickers on my car. 
Why do you think it was me? 
"I am the proud secretary for the father of the smartest kid at Pickney". 
It may have been me. 
Dick, did you see this article about Tommy in the paper? 
Tommy, my son, the child genius? 
Yes, that Tommy. 
"Finest to compete in Pickney's knowledge bowl. 
Smartest kid expected to win". 
Ah, here it is. 
"Tommy's father, Dr. Dick Solomon, 
physics professor at nearby Pendleton university, reminds people that genius is 1% perspiration and 99% brilliant father". 
You don't think I overstated my influence, do you? 
No. 
And hip, and hip, and hip, hip, hip. 
Now the arms, and arms, and out, and in. 
And, Sally, you're leading again. 
I keep forgetting I'm the girl. 
I've got to go,  I'm getting my chest waxed. 
Uh... hey, you want to come? 
I've got a coupon. 
No, I prefer to tweeze. 
Ouch! 
I'm not usually attracted to your type, but you are something special. 
Well, what you see is what you get. 
So you're pretty into him, huh? 
I think he might be the one. 
Why would I want to wax my chest? 
Okay, Tommy, I read that you're competing in the knowledge bowl. 
So what? 
 So, we have to review. 
What?! Dick, 
that's stupid. 
I'm the information officer. 
I know everything. 
Maybe, maybe not. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
How about physics... 
in Russian? 
Wrong. It's... 
Now you asked the question wrong.. 
If you want it "crytami", you should have asked... 
Famous Ontologists in Greek. 
..Bryant Gumbel. 
In the form of a question. 
..Bryant Gumbel? 
Whatever! 
Poets of the Li river delta. 
Complete Huang Po's classic couplet of love and betrayal. 
This isn't even a so-called life. 
Oh, well, as Harry Houdini once said, pick a card, any card. 
It's my mission to be a teenager, but right now I hate my father, I hate my school, and my life seems hopeless. Some teenager I am. 
Cut the deck. 
If I'm going to do my job, I've got to be in a real school, one with metal detectors and pregnant cheerleaders. 
Fold the edges of your card ever so slightly. 
Why am I even putting myself through all this? 
So Dick can feel proud? 
Pick another card, add the value, multiply it by four. 
So, I mean, this whole thing's crazy. 
I'm not Dick's son. I'm 
the information officer. 
I've got to bring this mission back on course. 
Write the number on your arm so that I cannot see it. 
There's only one thing left to do.. 
 Shuffle. 
Sabotage. 
All right, we're okay as long as none of those are clubs. 
Pick a card. 
Ta-da! 
Remember to phrase your answer in the form of an answer. 
Okay, next question: "Tabula Rasa" is a Latin term meaning what? 
Tommy knows this one. 
What's wrong with him? 
"Tabula Rasa" means blank slate. 
That is correct. 
He's probably just nervous. 
Relax, damn you! 
Relax! 
Which impressionist painter is known for his series of water lilies? 
That's a very easy one, Dr. Menard. 
The answer is... 
Picasso. 
No! 
The answer is Claude Monet. 
Dr. Solomon, 
competition is essential to learning. 
Bite me! 
What is the outer envelope, or atmosphere, of gas surrounding the sun called? 
Ooh, mmm... 
that's a toughie. 
you have 10 seconds. 
Five seconds. 
Three, two, one. 
It's called the corona! 
You've been there! 
You know that! 
Dick, come on. He's trying. He's your son. 
Son? 
He's not my son. 
I have no son! 
Let's go win us a contest. 
Sally, why don't you wear that little red number you've got? 
It'll look better with my outfit. 
But I look so hot. 
You must have something flashier than that. Let me see your closet. 
Fine. Help me with the zipper. 
Don't worry, I'm very good at this. 
Now slip out of that dress. 
Oh! 
Oh! 
Look, I've made a big, big mistake. 
What's wrong? What did I do? 
How can I put this?...I expected... more. 
What, I'm not your kind of woman? 
Oh, Sally, you are a woman. 
What did you think I was?! 
Wow. 
I have never seen such reprehensible behavior. 
I know, I don't blame you if you have to expel Tommy. 
Dr. Solomon, we still 
consider Tommy Pickney material. 
It is you who are banned from the Pickney. 
I'm banned? 
Well, guess what. 
Tommy didn't even want to come to this robot factory outlet. 
I made him. 
Me, me, me! 
And now I'm putting him back in a real school where he can be himself, the kind of school where kids aren't judged on how well they test or how much they know. 
Where they aren't judged at all. 
Where they have the freedom to stay faceless and nameless from "K" through 12. 
Carrying their diplomas straight through the golden arches and on into their waiting mac Jobs! 
Come on, Tommy. 
We're going home. 
Thank you, sir. 
Dick and Tommy were the best of pals. 
But then, one day, Dick used Tommy to make himself look good. 
Now, to get back at him, Tommy used Dick to make Dick look very bad. 
Now, apart they were just two separate handkerchiefs. 
Oh, shut up, Harry. 
 Shut up, Harry. 
But then, magically, they got back together. 
Why did you do that to me? 
I don't know. 
I guess 'cause you made my life suck. 
Why didn't you just tell me that? 
I tried to. You were 
impenetrably happy. 
What is it about the father-son relationship that makes communication so difficult? 
Is it the father using his son to make good on his unfulfilled dreams? 
Or is it the son defining himself by rejecting his father? 
It's neither. It's both. 
It's men. 
And how did you acquire this new expertise? 
Oh, yeah. What happened with Glenn? 
Well, remember when we said that two sexes must be so limiting? 
I think Glenn found a loophole. 
You're a precocious kid, but this is a game of wisdom. 
All right, old man, let's settle this once and for all. 
Checkmate! 
 Oh, damn it! 
Oh! 
Oh, wait. Look. 
My rook can take your.. 
oh. 
The big day is tomorrow, And these turkeys seem to know what's coming their way. 
It's the end of the world! 
Wait, wait, wait, wait! 
What's going on? 
Dick! 
There's a terrible crisis. 
We were at the store, and the place was a madhouse. 
People were cramming everything they could into their carts, especially these giant balls of butter. 
I got one for each of us. 
I'm telling you, something is up. 
The radio said the airports were jammed with people trying to get out of town. 
As a matter of fact, I just saw a report on a turkey ranch, and those birds were talking apocalypse. 
Apocalypse? 
 Well, more like "apocalopolis". 
What does this all mean? 
Well, I have a thought.. 
we're all gonna die! 
All right, let's not panic. 
Tonight we'll turn off the lights and hunker down in the kitchen. 
Tomorrow morning I'll make a run to the university and find out what's going on. 
Police and secure the perimeter! 
 What? 
Lock the doors! 
 Oh, yeah! 
Hello? Hello? Mary! 
Mary! 
Mary, what have they done to your hair? 
Speak to me, Mary! 
Dr. Solomon, what are you doing here? 
I'm trying to find Mary, but she's probably already dead! 
Are you sure she's not home eating a big meal, celebrating the holiday? 
"Holiday"? 
What do you mean, "holiday"? 
It's thanksgiving. 
 Ohh! 
So it's not the apocalypse. 
It's.. what 
did you call it? 
Thanksgiving. 
You should be home with your loved ones around a dinner table, giving thanks for what you've got. 
But.. well, why 
are you here? 
Yeah, well, I took St. Patrick's day off. 
For six months. 
So Mary isn't dead? 
 Probably not. 
She's giving thanks. 
 That's right. 
With her loved ones. 
 Yeah. 
But.. but.. 
but that's me! 
Go on home. 
Have a beer. 
Take a nap. 
You'll feel like a human being. 
Well, of course I will, 'cause that's what I am, a human being. 
Overlooking the holidays was simply.. 
human error. 
Oh, Dick! We gotta 
get out of here! 
It's gotten worse. They've 
stopped delivering the mail. 
Of course they have. 
Someone's taken over the airwaves. 
There's a terrifying parade on every channel! 
Of course there is. 
I got the gnome! I got the gnome! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
Slow down there, speedboat. 
It's just thanksgiving. 
"thanks-what-ing"? 
 Thanksgiving, it's a holiday. 
Like big, giant head day? 
Similar, except nobody gets thrown into the sun. 
It's a national holiday. 
Everybody gets to take the day off. 
Except for Sally. 
What? 
She has to go into the kitchen and make an enormous feast. 
Great. Our first holiday 
on earth, and I got to cook. 
And then after we eat, we have to give thanks. 
To me, for cooking? 
Ohh! 
Sally. 
No, we have to give thanks for something bigger, Something more important, something like.. 
well, not this, but something like how good looking I am. 
Maybe if we just run it through, it'll hit us. 
Why should we run through anything? 
'Cause I called Mary, she's coming over. 
But what if we get it wrong? 
It'll give us away. 
Now, look, men. 
When we first landed on this planet, we didn't know squat. 
We didn't even know what the word "squat" meant. 
And we had to find out the hard way. 
 And it hurt. 
All we have to do is find a human example and follow it. 
Hello, hello, everybody! 
 Mrs. Dubcek. 
Close enough. 
Happy thanksgiving, everybody . This is my daughter, Vicki. 
Oh, I didn't know Mrs. Dubcek had a.. 
I mean, hello-o-o-o-o. 
Hi. You have 
great hair. 
So, uh, what are you ladies doing for thanksgiving? 
We're going off to the beef 'n' griddle. 
 Oh, no, you're not. 
You're coming over to our house to help us. 
Uh, celebrate. 
Yeah, we don't know what we're doing. 
Uh, celebrate. 
What do you say, Vick? 
 I say, what the hell? 
Then "What the hell" it is. 
Turkey, no turkey. 
Turkey, no turkey. 
Turkey... 
and no turkey. 
Oh, Harry, you've got a real childlike innocence about you. 
It's very sexy. 
Turkey. 
Wow, this is the ugliest lingerie I've ever seen. 
But buckles. 
 Mmm. 
Oh, that? No. 
That's just a costume I wore in a thanksgiving play I did in junior high. 
I was a pilgrim, and every time I wore it, I put everybody in the thanksgiving mood. 
Tommy? 
 What? 
You heard what she said. 
Forget it, Dick, I'm not putting that thing on. 
Once again, you let us down. 
 What are you talking about? 
You're the information officer. You should 
have prepped us for this holiday weeks ago, and now you won't wear the costume! 
Is there any end to your treachery? 
Look Dick, if it's a holiday, why don't you just take the day off my back. 
Oh, I will. 
I will not allow my disappointment in you to destroy this festival, even though the costume would put us all in the thanksgiving mood. 
Yeah, well, it'll put me in the crappy mood! 
You're always in the crappy mood. 
Now, come on, put it on! 
 No! 
Put it on! 
 No! 
Happy thanksgiving! 
Oh, happy thanksgiving, Mary. 
Put it on! 
 No! 
Ever since we got here, I can't do anything right for you. Why is that? 
Don't use use that tone of voice with me, old man. 
 Oh! I'm going for a walk. 
Oh, fine! And don't come 
back until you're damn ready to sit down with your family and have fun! 
Uh...Dubcek, so what am I 
supposed to do with this thing? 
You stick your hand right up there and yank out its guts. 
What's the point? 
It's already dead. 
That's how it's done. 
 All right. 
Sally, look who's here. 
I thought you might need a little help cooking. 
Why? Don't you think she's ever cooked a 
thanksgiving dinner before? 
Is that what you think? 
Yeah, you don't think I've ever cooked a thanksgiving dinner before? 
No, I didn't say that. 
 Because thanksgiving is not new to us. 
And we're certainly not new to thanksgiving. 
So, when's dinner, three o-clock? 
Today? 
 Three! On the dot! 
All right, move it. Uh, 
Dubcek, take out the relish tray, and Mary, hold this. 
Okay, now, does the fork go on the right or on the left? 
Well, this goes here, and this goes here. 
Are those the rules? 
Oh, forget about the rules, Harry! 
Just put whatever you want to put wherever you want to put it. 
Can I put my shirts in my underwear drawer? 
Go wild. 
Okay. 
Maybe you should rub it with a little margarine before you put it in. 
You heard the woman. 
Rub that bird. 
I don't think so. All it 
needs is a little salt. 
No margarine! 
Heavy on the salt! 
If you want the skin to crisp.. 
Want skin crisp now. 
Want you dead now. 
Dick, my grandmother had a saying.. 
"Get out of the kitchen before I burn you with a hot spoon". 
Your grandmother had a rapier wit. 
She did. 
Dick, get out of the kitchen! 
And she was mean too. 
Are you open? 
 'Course we're open. It's thanksgiving. 
Excuse me. This game's not 
three-Dimensional, is it? 
Uh, yeah. Uh, you want to play some 8-ball? 
What's 8-ball? 
 Don't worry, we're not very good either. 
Harry, you should see the beautiful turkey Sally has in the kitchen. 
Oh, there's a turkey here? 
 Oh, it's enormous! 
I want to see it! 
You murdered it! 
Although we are very familiar with this tradition, it never ceases to appall us. 
Well, I did it. 
Here it is, folks.. 
the perfect turkey! 
Shouldn't we wait for Tommy? 
We're starting without him. 
Well, but I poured some grape juice in a wine glass, and who's gonna sit at the kids' table? 
Doesn't matter. 
Fine, okay. Thanksgiving's ruined. Hack away. 
Oh, no, no, I.. 
I couldn't make the first hack. Mary, you hack. 
Before we hack the turkey, shouldn't someone give thanks? 
Uh, here we all are, gathered together for a completely authentic thanksgiving dinner, perfect in every way. 
I just want to say I am thankful that we are all here to feast on this dead bird. 
We're not all here. 
Tommy's not here. 
Thank you so much for bringing that up! 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
Don't worry. Tommy will be back. 
 Thank you! 
Hey. Excuse me. 
I'd like to add a little something, if I may. 
Uh, I just feel that this year I have so much to be thankful for. 
That thing under my armpit went away. 
And when I was working at wal-mart and that big stack of boxes fell on me. 
I got workman's comp for eight months, and that's.. 
that's twice as much as my normal salary, so... 
guess you'd have to say that god has been very, very good to me. 
Let's eat! 
You know, I left because they don't appreciate me. 
And I do a lot for those guys. 6 ball, corner pocket. 
I mean, they just don't understand how difficult it is to be a kid. 
I mean, I do a lot at home, but you have to have a life outside work too, you know. 
7 ball, side pocket. 
I mean, occasionally I screw up. I'm only trying to be human. 
But whatever I do, it's never enough for those people. 
8 ball, three banks, back pocket. 
You know what I mean? 
That's game. 
Tommy, they're hard on you because they love you. 
Yeah, at least you've got somebody. 
My father used to take me out to the shed every Friday, whether I deserved it or not. 
Why? 
Because he cared. 
He just wanted to make me strong, that's all. 
I should go home and thank him. 
Well, why don't you? 
I can't afford to, you've got all my money! 
Here, take it. 
Go home. 
Oh, Tommy, man! 
You're the best! 
I love you, man! 
I love you! 
Hey, Frank.. 
 Hold on. 
Hi, dad, it's Francis. 
What are you doing? 
It's tradition. 
I like it. 
What's the matter with us, Harry? 
I'm gettin' drowsy, and I can't fight it. 
I feel like I'm gonna explode. 
I'm gonna ex-uh-pul-lode! 
Stay with me, Harry. 
I'll save you. 
No! 
Save yourself! 
Harry! 
Harry, can you hear me? 
Harry! 
It's Dick! Come back to 
me! Come back to me, Harry! 
Dick? 
 Harry! 
Talk to me! 
What's for dessert? 
Wow, your mother's refrigerator is far more spacious than ours. 
Did you get enough to eat Pumpkin? 
Well, that depends on what you're talking about. 
And what do you think I'm talkin' about? 
Yams. 
Oh, I got yams for ya. 
Don't you want to put a little mini marshmallow on that? 
Yahtzee. 
No, Dick, that wasn't Yahtzee, that was two of a kind. 
Yahtzee. 
 No, that's not a Yahtzee. 
Yahtzee. 
Five in a row. 
They lost the instructions. 
Tommy knows how to play. 
 Well, Tommy's not here. 
Yahtzee. 
It's too bad. He would 
have really liked my stuffing. 
Well, he should have put on the pilgrim costume. 
Why didn't you put on the pilgrim costume? 
You're the one who wanted to show off and have a big, stupid thanksgiving. 
That's not why I had a big, stupid thanksgiving. I did it for all of you. 
Oh, admit it, Dick.. 
everything is about you. 
What about you? You had a good time. 
Oh, yeah, if you call spending a whole day in the kitchen with these two jabbermouths a good time. 
Hey! One of those 
jabbermouths is his girlfriend! 
Yeah! 
I have had it with all of you! 
This holiday is over! 
 Oh, I see! Well! 
Now I have something to give thanks for. Thanks for nothing! 
This is why I go to the beef 'n' griddle. 
I've never felt this way before. 
I've never felt this sticky before. 
Harry, I got to go home to Orlando tomorrow. 
But I'll be back. 
You know, I like you, Harry. You're.. 
you're not like the other guys. 
Ah. 
No, ma'am. 
Do you, uh.. do you think 
we could make it work? 
Oh, I don't know. 
I'm pretty tired. 
I meant us, Harry. 
I definitely think that "us" could work. 
Me too. 
Your family's a little strange, though. 
Ha! Your Mother's 
Mrs. Dubcek. 
Oh, Mary, I'm so sorry about everything. 
What? 
 Oh the tension, the fighting, the lumpy gravy. 
 Yeah. 
You give and you give and you give until you just can't give anymore. 
Mmm. Same thing 
happens at my house. 
This happens at your house? 
 Why should my house be any different than 99% of all the homes in America? 
What about the other one percent? 
Connecticut. 
Hey, guys. 
 Tommy, you're back. 
Oh, I'll leave you two alone. 
Sorry I left like that. 
No, that's all right. 
I don't think it was your fault. 
I found out something pretty cool. 
You know how you tried to make this a special day, but all the resentment I had for you came spewing out and we ended up spending the whole day avoiding each other? 
Yeah. 
 It's normal. 
I was gonna tell you the same thing! 
Yeah, the screaming, the fighting, the exploding resentments.. 
that's what thanksgiving is! 
So we did get it right. 
 Yeah. 
Nailed it. 
 Oh, yeah. 
Tommy. 
I've never felt so content. 
I look around this room and I see nothing but familiar faces. 
Well, some are more familiar than others. 
I barely know you. 
But it doesn't matter, because tonight you're all family, and this has been the perfect thanksgiving. 
And now for the perfect dessert. 
Surprise! 
Well..I guess not everyone 
likes jell-O. 
Listen, Dick, we better not let another one of these big holidays sneak up on us. 
Oh, don't worry, lieutenant, after this one, there couldn't possibly be another one for months. 
You know, after cooking that huge dinner tonight, I think I deserve a break. 
What do you plan to do? 
 I think... 
tomorrow I'm gonna spend a nice, peaceful day at the mall. 
Really? 
I hear there's a sale. 
Really? Goody! 
And one, and two, and there you go, that's it! 
Feel the burn. 
Well, hello, strange baby. 
Who's that? 
Well I don't know, some baby. 
That's no baby. 
Babies are pink, and wrinkly, and wear blankets. Dick, 
you better come in here. 
Who's this? 
I don't know. Some baby. 
What does it want? 
Here, I'll find out. 
What do you want?! 
Hello, has anybody seen my.. 
there's my little rug rat. 
Mrs. Dubcek, 
you had a baby. 
He's my grandson, I'm babysitting him. 
My son and his wife are spending the week at Caesar's palace. 
Ah, Rome. 
 Mmm. 
Could I ask you folks to do me a favour? 
Could you watch the little guy while I run out to the doctor's? 
No. 
 Yes, we'd be happy to. 
Oh, great, great. 
He's had his nap, and he's just been changed. 
What was he before? 
Mrs. Dubcek, 
why do you assume that Sally will be taking care of the baby? 
Well, she's a woman. 
Yet another perk. 
I'll go get his stuff. 
Now he may be a little bit cranky, he's got teeth coming in. 
Well, don't worry, we'll sign for them. 
Permission to ask what the hell you just did. 
It's an opportunity to observe a brand-new human. 
Besides, you always said you wanted a baby. 
Not this baby, I want one of my own, one I made from scratch. 
What's that smell? 
Hey, I've been working out. 
Turn it off! 
I can't. 
 Then turn it down. 
What?! 
What do you want? 
Are you hungry? Tommy, 
entertain him till I get back. 
Wait, what, I don't know what.. 
All right, kid, I'll read you a story. 
Um... "dingo boy 
released from pound. 
Burt Reynolds up in arms". 
Look. It's a little dingo boy. See? 
Move it. 
 Hey, those are my croutons! 
Let him buy his own croutons. 
Look, he's eating. 
He likes the croutons, Harry. 
They're nummy num, yeah! 
Why are you talking like that to the baby? 
I have my reasons. 
Well, I'm off. 
Dick, look. Mrs. Dubcek was right, 
I am great with this kid. 
Well, how hard could it be? Look how cute he is. 
He's screaming? 
Why is he screaming? 
Somebody make him stop. 
Hey, he stopped. 
See, I'm great with this kid, and he hates you. 
Give me that baby. 
Damn! 
See? You make him cry. 
Nonsense, haven't you ever heard of tears of joy? 
Yeah. 
Come on now. Wear the hat.. 
 No, no, no. 
Come on. 
It's Mary's going-away party. 
She's only going to be gone for three days. 
Please wear the hat. Hat, hat, hat! 
 No, no, no, no! 
Hello. 
Surprise! 
 Surprise. 
Mary, I miss you already. 
Now, Dick, you don't have to throw me a surprise party every time I go to a conference. 
You wouldn't be saying that if Nina had worn her hat. 
Oh, Nina... 
here are my keys. 
You know where I keep the fish food. 
 Yes. 
Nina's taking care of your fish? 
 Yes. 
Mary, shouldn't I be doing that? 
a-ha...uh... Nina already 
knows where I keep the food. 
I see. 
She already knows. 
 Uhhuh. 
It must make it a lot easier for you, then. 
Well if you really want to do it.. 
 Oh Yes I do, I do! 
Mary, I want to take care of your fish desperately. 
Really, Nina, thank you so much. 
Just doing my job. 
I have fish, you know. 
Do you? 
 Mmhmm, they're in my freezer. 
Here you go, baby. 
Well, he hated that. 
When is Sally going to get back with those diapers? 
Oh, look! Some coming out 
of his nose again. 
It's like he's got wetness coming out of every hole in his body. 
Dumb, wet baby. 
Hey, he likes it. 
Maybe not. 
Suddenly it's not quite so funny when I do it, now, is it? 
What? - It's a baby. 
 Oh. 
Oh, Mary, this means so much to me. 
Yeah. Okay, 
now let's go over this one more time. 
The filter and the heater are automatic. 
Don't touch them. 
 Well, what if I need to touch them? 
Why should you need to touch them? 
Well what if I want to touch them? 
Just don't touch them. 
Now, here's something I like to do. 
If the fish have been good, I like to reward them with a little brine shrimp. 
And if they're bad. 
I'll make them watch while I eat the brine shrimp. 
Now, this might sound silly, but I'm very attached to these fish. 
Please don't kill them. 
You love your fish, and I love you. 
That's why I'm going to love your fish. 
Just feed them. 
Don't touch the filter! 
Okay. 
Hello? 
What is the matter with you two? 
How many times do I have to go over this? When that baby is asleep, 
the phone is not to ring more than once. 
Right. The one-ring rule. 
That's right. 
Harry, did you throw applesauce all over the floor? 
No, it was the baby. 
He made a cute little design. 
Mrs. Dubcek.. 
 Shh! 
She won't be back until tomorrow. 
 What?! 
She said she was still woozy from the medication, that she got on the wrong bus and woke up in a petting zoo in Cleveland. 
Oh, that old excuse. 
We get to keep the baby another day. 
Oh, great. 
And by the way, it was me that spilled applesauce. 
 It was? 
No, it was the baby. 
I've been meaning to talk to you about that.. 
 Shh! I think I hear him 
turning over. 
I don't hear anything. 
Of course you don't. You're a man. 
How could this happen? 
That baby has taken control of us. 
The one with the least intelligence is running the show. 
This is getting old fast. There 
are three of us and only one of him. 
We're bigger than him and way smarter. 
We could take this baby. 
Who's with me? 
Come on, men. 
One ring. 
Hello, fish. 
Look at you in there. 
What are you thinking? I 
know what you're thinking. 
Are you in the tank, or am I? 
Well, it's you, stupid fish. 
Here, I brought you some presents.. 
a treasure chest filled with gold doubloons, a topless mermaid. 
Try not to stare. 
And, best of all, I brought you a new friend. 
I call her snowflake because she's soft and delicate. 
I thought you might like it if I read you a night-night story. 
It's called "Tales of the Calypso: secrets of the ocean deep". 
"Slowly, so slowly, the day turned to night. 
The darkness taunts the light that dances in the depths below. 
Suddenly and without warning, danger strikes. 
Octopus, octopus, your children are dying." 
I want that. I want that. 
I want that. 
I want that. I want that. I want.. 
Harry, we're here to get something for the baby. 
We're not here to get something for you. 
 Nuts. 
Here, baby. 
What about this one? 
Where'd he go? 
Oh, no! 
Hold on, baby! 
 No, Sally, you can't! 
Let me go! I've got to save him. 
Get a hold of yourself! It's a 
bottomless ball pit of death! 
I don't care! 
That's my baby! 
No! 
Ohh, I've got him! 
I've got him! 
Hey, lady, we only let children climb in the ball pit. 
That is so sick. 
Lieutenant, you look like hell. 
I mean the "locked in a car wash overnight" kind of hell. 
Yeah, it's this baby. 
He ran me ragged all day. 
That insolent little twerp. 
He's gone too far. Tomorrow I'm 
granting you a one-day furlough. 
Go into town. 
Get yourself a tattoo. 
I can't. Tomorrow I'm 
taking the baby to the park, and then the zoo, and then I'm taking him golfing. 
I think he has real talent. 
I don't understand. You sound 
like you're actually enjoying this. 
I am. 
I know I complained at the start, but this is the first assignment I've had where I really feel like I'm using all of me. 
It sounds crazy, but I cannot do enough for him. 
The more he needs me, the more I need him. 
I have a great idea. 
Let's wake him up, then rock him back to sleep. 
 No! 
Why not? 
 What's the matter with you? 
It's as if this baby has made you go all soft. 
He's broken down your defenses. 
I know. 
He's my wittle bunny wabbit. 
God, what kind of talk is that? You're a weapons expert. 
I'm still a warrior. 
It's just now I'm the protector, not the aggressor. 
I've heard enough. 
I'm going to sleep. 
You can't. I've tucked him in your bed. 
As high commander, I order you to untuck him at once. 
Dick, I'm not taking orders from you anymore. 
I'm taking orders from a higher commander. 
His rank: baby. 
But wait! 
Where am I going to sleep? 
Use his room. 
Fine. 
Morning, children. 
Hello, snowflake. 
Where's everybody else? 
Come out, come out! 
Why, snowflake, you're looking a little bloated. 
Oh, my god! 
You bad fish! 
Bad, bad fish! 
Where's that brine shrimp? 
See? 
None for you! 
Dick! 
Mary, you've come back early. 
The conference was a disaster. I had to get out of there. 
Are you sure that was a good idea? Maybe you should go back. 
No. Besides, 
I missed you. 
Oh, I was so lone.. 
where's my fish? 
Oh... there's your fish. 
That's not my fish. 
Sure, it is. 
You killed my fish! 
No, I didn't! 
He did. 
You jackass! 
 Yeah, you jackass! 
Hello, sweetheart. 
Can you say my name? 
Sally. 
 No. 
Sal-ly. 
No. 
Sal-ly. 
No. 
Sal-ly. 
You know, you shouldn't try so hard. 
Kids develop at different rates. 
And resistance is the sign of an analytical mind. 
Really? 
 No. 
Don't listen to him. You 
know what I'm going to do? 
I'm going to find Mr. Sock monkey. 
You like Mr. Sock monkey, right? 
Sally! 
Sally, I feel just awful. 
I've killed the fish of the woman I love. 
 Uhhuh. 
Mr. Sock monkey, 
where are you? 
Those fish were everything to her. 
I've got to find something to replace them. 
Come on out, you argyle piece of crap! 
 Sally? Hello? 
She can't hear you. She 
can only hear the baby. 
Harry, have you seen Mr. Sock monkey? 
Why, no. 
Why would you ask me? 
I haven't seen him all day. 
La, la-la, la, la, la-la It's probably in the bedroom. 
Call me if he needs anything. 
What am I going to do? 
Well, hello. 
Sock monkey! 
Give that to me! 
Yes, yes, you should do just fine. 
You might even fit in the tank. 
Mary? Mary, do you 
remember how I killed your fish? 
No. 
 Well, I did, but I brought you something to make you feel better. Come on in! 
Whose baby is that? 
Mine. 
Well, not for keeps. 
It's really Sally's. 
I mean, she got it from Mrs. Dubcek. 
Let's just call it a rental. 
Come on. 
Play with it. 
Dick you've got to take that child back to its mother. 
Come on. 
Just hold him. 
I guarantee you'll like it. 
I'm serious. 
Just take him for a spin around the block, and then we'll talk. 
There you are! 
There "you" are. 
I'll deal with you, as soon as I deal with you, sweetie. 
Come on, honey. 
Come on, Dick! 
Oh... 
Why are you so angry? 
 I'm not talking to you. 
Oh, you found him. 
Oh, good, now we can stop looking. 
I was going to bring him right back lieutenant. 
If I were a good mother, I'd push you down those stairs. 
You're not a mother. 
Well technically, no, but that's going to change. 
How? 
 I've decided to keep the baby. 
What?! - No! 
You can't. He's not yours. 
I'm willing to overlook that. 
He needs me. 
He's helpless. 
And what am I! 
You can't keep him. They 
have rules about these things. 
They have laws about these things. 
They have TV movies about these things. 
Dick, I'm keeping him. 
That's final. 
Hello?  Anybody home? 
 Oh, my god! 
I have to hide him. 
 What? 
You're coming right back in here this instant! Sally! 
Thanks so much for watching my grandson. 
I have been to hell and back. 
I won't bore you. 
 You're too late. 
Well, where is my little fella? 
Mrs. Dubcek, I'm 
so glad you're here. 
We're having a problem with our oven. 
 What kind of problem? 
How should I know? You're 
a landlady. You tell us. 
Harry, Show Mrs. Dubcek to the oven. 
Stuff her in it if you have to. 
Sally! 
 Is she gone yet?  No! 
Then we're not coming out. 
I order you to think this through. 
 Okay. Hmm, no! 
Sally, no.. 
Your oven seems fine. 
I'll just get my little boy, and I'll be on my way. 
So soon, Mrs. Dubcek? 
We've been living in this attic for almost a year now, and we know very little about you. Sit down. 
Tell us everything about yourself. Leave nothing out. 
Please everything. Travel? 
 Marriages.  Medical history. 
Well, there's a doctor in Mexico that once said I had the exact DNA of a lemur. 
Ohh, that's fascinating. 
I'll be right back. 
Sally! 
Well, here he is. 
You have to go home now, baby. 
There's my little man. 
Bye, baby. 
 Bye, Sally. 
Aw! Come on, 
sweetheart. 
Oh, what a big boy you are. 
Were you a good boy? Yes! 
Well, thank god he's gone. 
I'm going to miss him. 
Excuse me. I'm going to go 
take care of the other baby. 
What was that all about? 
I thought you loved him. 
 I do. 
Then why did you suddenly give him back? 
I guess I love him enough to know that his real mom needs him more than I do. 
You know, when I couldn't find him, I went crazy. 
I couldn't put his mother through that. 
Why don't you have one of your own? 
 That would be great. 
Why don't you go for it? 
Yeah, right. And let this body go to hell? 
Mary, we have to talk. 
You have a dog. 
 Yes. 
Mary I want everything to go back to the way it was before I killed your fish. 
I'm afraid that's going to take some time. 
I know what it means to lose something that you care about, and what I did was very, very wrong. 
Why do you have a dog? 
Well, I went to the pet store to buy you some new fish, and I saw this cute little guy. 
Oh, Dick, I can't take care of a dog. 
If you can love a fish, you can love a dog. 
Well, he is kind of cute. 
Come here, boy. 
Oh, look at him. 
He loves you, Mary. 
Oh, it's that thing again. 
I have a name. 
Football, I thought they canceled that in January. 
Well, guess they brought it back. 
I still don't see the point. What's it all about? 
Well from what I understand, they try to kill whoever has the ball. 
Those two guys in the middle seem awfully... intimate. 
Yeah, they've been going at it the whole game. 
Yeah, they should just get a room. 
Is there any upside? 
Well, if you make it down to the big poles, you get to dance. 
Dance? 
And if you're really good, you win a trip to some fruitbowl. 
But only the best dancers make it. 
See ya. 
 Whoa. Where are you going? 
I have Glee club practice. 
 Glee club? 
Yeah. 
Oh I see, you've changed your mission. 
Now you're researching what it's like to be a girl. 
For your information, Glee club is not just for girls. 
Yeah, it's also for Geeks and Nancy boys. 
Hey! 
Oh, he's dancing. 
Hey! 
 This is obviously a waste of time. 
Go do something with one of your girlfriends. That's an order. 
Fine! 
Wait a minute. 
I don't have any girlfriends. 
You and me, sister. 
You and me. 
They are so good. 
They ought to be. 
They've been playing the same damn song for the past six hours. 
They're a marching band. 
Why don't they march? 
Preferably into the ocean. 
Oh come on Dick, don't tell me you're not excited about the homecoming weekend. 
You know, between the Pendleton badgers and Ohio western mustangs. 
Oh, it's football. 
Everywhere I turn, it's football, football, big, fat shmutball. 
Well, forgive me, Mr. Intellectual. 
God forbid you should come down from your ivory tower for four quarters. 
Four quarters? I don't care 
what you pay me, I'm not going. 
It's bad enough there was a giant papier mach� rodent blocking my parking spot this morning. 
You mean Pendleton J. Badger. 
What does the "j" stand for? 
Nothing. 
Nothing starts with "N". 
It's just a kooky initial. 
"Q" is kookier. 
Why isn't it Pendleton Q. Badger? 
I don't know. 
Why don't you ask him? 
Anyway, I got us great seats. 
It's not just a sporting event. 
It's a long-standing tradition.. 
Pendleton versus Ohio western. 
You know, if you really want to defeat them, the secret is right in front of you.. the giant badger. 
It's a Trojan float. 
Load our team in. We push 
it up to their school walls. 
And they say, "look. 
A friendly giant badger. 
Let's bring it inside." 
Later, that night, they fall asleep, and "Whammo"! 
It could work. 
It's not very sportsmanlike. 
Well, I'll admit it doesn't involve any dancing or homoerotic butt-Slapping. 
Although, you never know what goes on inside a giant badger. 
"Bali hai" "may call you" "any night" "any day" "here am I" "your special island" "come away" "come away" "Bali hai" That was really, um... 
better. 
Everyone take a seat. 
You know, you mustn't be afraid to sing from your heart, from your mind, from your body. 
Music is the sound your soul makes. 
Try it like this. 
"You'll hear me call you" "singing through the sunshine" "sweet and clear as can be" "here am I" "come to me" "here am I, come to me" "here am I come to me" "Bali hai" Okay, now who would like to stand up and try it like that? 
Tommy. 
Nina, how's it going? 
Well I'm kind of busy.. 
Great..um..Listen, um... 
we're friends, aren't we? 
 Yeah, sure. 
Good, 'cause I've decided we're best friends. You got a problem with that? 
Uh... no. 
 Thanks, Nina. 
I finally have a girlfriend. You're my first one. 
Oh, Sally, I am? 
Why? Is that weird? 
 Oh, no. 
No, no. it's tough making 
friends with women. 
You're telling me. I can barely stand myself. 
So, uh... what do you 
want to do now, girlfriend? 
You want to go shopping or talk about cramps? 
Shopping. 
 Ok And, for Monday, I want you to read and outline chapters eight through 24. 
Except for chapter 12 which you will refute in a 10 page treatise with illustrations. 
Oh, come on. 
Dr. Solomon, it's homecoming weekend. 
 Yeah, the big game. 
Oh, yes, I forgot. 
God forbid that your intellectual development should get in the way of "the Big Game". 
What could be more important than "the Big Game"? 
The fate of mankind rests on the outcome of "the Big Game". 
Is he being sarcastic? 
Oh, and I've got news for you. 
The "j" in Pendleton J. 
Badger, it's meaningless. 
Dr. Solomon, you've insulted my intelligence, 
my religion, and my family, and that's okay. 
But there's one thing you cannot insult, and that's the badgers because there's something you don't even know about a badger, man. 
When they dig holes, they do it for a reason. 
And their teeth, they're really sharp when they're very young. 
So I'm going to that game, and I don't care if you fail me for it. 
But you're already failing. 
Okay, as long as we see eye to eye, then. 
I just don't see why you care so much about a team that has no chance of winning. 
Why are you so passionate about a lost cause? 
Ohio western's record is 6-1. 
They're going to win, why don't you root for them? 
But we go to Pendleton, we're the badgers, and the badgers are us, we're us, not them, they're them. 
We're us with the.. 
don't you get it? 
No, why didn't you just go to western? 
Because we... 
choked on our S.A.T.s. 
That skirt was really cute, wasn't it? 
 Yeah. 
And there were those shoes that looked so great on you. 
Thank you. So, this is where you live. 
Oh, Nina, I'm glad you're here, get me some coffee. 
We're not at the office, I'm here with Sally. 
Yeah, that's right, she's my friend, my best friend. 
If she's going to get anybody coffee, it's going to be me. 
We'll see about that. 
Nina, who are you going to get coffee for? Sally or me? 
Okay, I have to go home and feed my cat. 
I didn't know you had a cat. 
 I'm going to go buy one. 
I'll call you in 10 minutes. 
 Okay. 
According to the "Daily Badgerian", over 45,000 alumni will return to Pendleton for the homecoming game. 
You'd think that after four years they'd want to put the experience behind them. 
All I know is, my friend Nina and I are going together. 
We bought new outfits. 
I think I'm going to go, too. 
Really? 
It's not that I'm being sucked in, it's purely scientific. 
And who knows? 
Pendleton might win. 
That would be Da Bomb. 
You heard me. 
Da Bomb! 
Dick, can I talk to you for a second? 
 What is it? 
I met this woman that I really like, and I think she likes me, but she's a little older.. 
31. 
But Tommy, do you really think a woman of that age would be interested in you? 
Sure. 
 Wow! Good job. 
What's your first move? 
I don't know, I want to take her someplace special, but.. 
Excuse me. 
What about August? 
She'll understand. She's a good kid. 
You know, there's a word for what you're doing here. 
Oh, right. It's called trading up. 
Guys, guess what. 
I went to the stadium to see if I could get a job as a vendor for the game. 
Did you get it? 
No. I didn't have enough 
experience to sell hot dogs. 
So they hired me as a security guard. 
hi. 
 hi, Tommy. 
Sunny d? 
Thank you. 
You know, Tommy, you may think I haven't noticed, but I really think you're making a lot of progress. 
I'm trying. 
I know you are, and it'll pay off, trust me. 
I'm counting on it. 
Oh Miss, Miss  Frost, I got you something else. 
It's a ticket to the homecoming Pendleton game. 
The Mustangs-badger game? 
 Yeah. 
That's very sweet, but I couldn't accept a gift. 
Oh no, but my dad, he gets them for free. 
He works at the university. 
They pay him squat, so they give him perks. 
Well, thank you, Tommy. 
Man on first. 
Hey, buy us a couple of beers? 
Sure. 
So, you girls going to the big game? 
We don't want to talk to you. We're just broke. 
This is so strange. I feel 
this gnawing in my stomach. 
I told you, this is not the place for oysters Rockefeller. 
No, it feels more like tension. 
I'm not sure, but I think I might actually be nervous about the game. 
Nervous? There's nothing 
to be nervous about because the badgers are going to win! 
Badgers beat the Mustangs? 
In your dreams! 
Go ahead, laugh now 'cause you're going to be crying tomorrow. 
Oh I don't think so, we're going to beat you a million to one! 
Oh, yeah, right, right, you're going to score 2,380 touchdowns a minute. 
You're not going to score anything. 
These aren't the same badgers you pushed around last year. 
Oh, really? 
Yeah. We've got a bunch of fifth year seniors, 
and they bulked up like crazy. 
ooh! 
Yeah! and they've got heart. 
Yeah, one each. 
Yeah. 
 Yeah? Well, I got bad news for you, lady. 
She's no lady, she's a badger. Show them your teeth Mary. 
Oh, yeah? Well, you're going down. 
And you know why? 
 Why? 
Because badgers suck. 
Badgers don't suck, they bite! 
You guys are nuts. 
Nuts like a Badger! 
 Yeah! 
Hurry! 
Hurry! 
Hurry! 
What? What? 
The western team bus is just pulling up! 
Oh, my god. 
This glass is cold. 
All right... 
let's just drop the axe there, little buddy. 
I said drop it! 
August, there's something I have to tell you. 
What is it? 
Well I never thought I'd say these words, but I'm in love with another woman. 
Who is it Tommy? 
It's Miss Frost. 
Miss Frost, the glee club teacher? 
I'm afraid so, it just happened. 
I understand. 
You gotta do what you gotta do. 
You're not upset or jealous? 
No. 
Not at all. 
I hope you two will be very happy together. 
Oh, there's something I have to tell you, too. 
I've been seeing Val Kilmer. 
Really? 
Oh, I'm glad you've got someone. 
Whew! 
We're very pleased, attendance is 19,438. 
We'll beat ya! 
We'll eat ya! 
We'll bite ya! 
We'll claw ya! 
We'll beat ya! 
We'll eat ya! 
Go, badgers! 
Oh Mary, you were so right. 
I feel great! 
I just feel tingly all over, and that's not just the lead paint talking. 
You really went all out, didn't you? 
 Yeah. 
Bug and pitman did it. They 
didn't want to, but I made them. 
It goes all the way down, you know. 
homecoming queen, is recovering nicely] Tommy. 
Oh, Miss. Frost. 
What a coincidence. 
"Corn Dog"? 
Well, hello, Mrs. Sumner. 
How's the Dean? 
 He's fine, thank you. 
Excellent. I'm afraid I'm going to 
have to look in that bag. 
What? 
Uh, uh... 
Oh, binoculars, huh? 
And exactly who is it that you were planning on looking at? 
Because around here we got a little thing called right to privacy. 
Okay, spread 'em, lady. 
 Oh! 
This is Solomon. 
I need a canine unit. 
you stop throwing things at the Pendleton band] Please, god, block the extra point! 
I promise I'll never ask for anything else! 
Screw Mary's shut-In grandmother! 
Just block that kick! 
Yes, yes, yes! 
Aw! 
 Yeah! 
There is no god! 
What do you think about your badgers now? 
Up yours, buddy. Quick, 
Dick, give him the finger. 
Yeah!...Ooooooh! 
What the hell's the matter with you?! 
I don't get it, our guys don't advance. 
They're in a constant state of retreat. 
I can't watch this anymore. 
23 get up here! 
Get in there and remind them we're going "that way". 
23, get back here. 
Excuse me, lady. 
Hey, I'm the coach. 
Oh, yeah? 
So you're the idiot who's running this team into the ground. 
That's me, you got a problem with that? 
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. 
Let me tell you what you can do. 
Take that pretty little body of yours, and march it up to the bleachers, and park it. 
I was just about to say the same thing to you. 
Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
Yeah? 
 Yeah! 
Why are your guys throwing the ball? 
Your throwing guy's too short to see over the fat guys. 
You need to run left, it's their weak side. 
What do we do after that, Miss Schottenheimer? 
You do it again, they won't expect it. 
She's right, coach. 
You shut up, or I'll quit fixing your grades. 
No. 
No, no. 
Oh, god, no! 
Yeah, now that's a play. 
You heard the lady. 
If you get any more of those good ideas, you mark 'em down on this pad for me. 
 Can do. 
You're doing a hell of a job. 
Yeah! 
I think there's been a misunderstanding. 
Apparently.

Hey, Nina, look what they gave me for winning. 
Ooh, steak sandwiches. 
Miss. Frost, I'm pretty 
sure we can work this out. 
Tommy, there is no we. 
There can't be, and I'm not just talking legally. 
Well, then why did you spend all that time singing to me, luring me like a siren to my destruction? 
I'm a singing teacher, Tommy. 
I sing. 
I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression. 
Look, I think you'd be better off with a girl your own age. 
Yeah. So what's your mother look like? 
Listen. 
Can you hear them celebrating? 
Ah, yes, The happy sounds of cars overturning and stores being looted. 
I love the smell of burning rubber. 
It smells like victory. 
 A sweet victory. 
You know, it's amazing. 
There we were, thousands of total strangers all pulling together, trying to transfer our collective strength to a tiny group of young men that we didn't even know. 
We cheered for them, and they won for us. 
I've never felt such a feeling of joy and camaraderie. 
The only sad part is that everyone couldn't share it. 
Someone had to lose. 
I feel for the mustang fans. 
Ah, screw 'em. 
You're right. 
Badgers rule! 
 Yeah! 
Okay, lovebirds, party's over. 
Let's, uh... 
take it inside. 
Mustangs give you problems. 
Mustangs give you grief. 
Mustangs give you trouble, but the badgers got the teeth. 
We're bad We're bad We're bad-gers! 
We're bad We're bad We're bad-gers! 
Not beavers Not hamsters Not gerbils Not lancers We're bad We're bad We're bad-gers!
