1 Look at that. 
Dogs in the diner. 
Where are we, Paris? 
'Cause if we are, I'm gonna stop wearing deodorant. 
Did you guys see that adorable dog? 
You mean the one leaking rabies all over the table while people are trying to eat? 
She said he's allowed to be in here. 
He's her registered emotional companion. 
Her registered full-of-crap what? 
He's got one of those official vests that says "don't pet me, I'm working." 
I have a shirt that says "federal bikini inspector," but there is simply no such branch of the U.S. government. 
Hi, so, uh, what the hell is this? 
Excuse me? 
I don't understand. 
Dogs aren't allowed in the diner. 
Oh, he's legally allowed to be here. 
He's my registered emotional companion. 
You mean you don't have a boyfriend. 
No, I suffer from anxiety. 
You mean you don't want to eat alone. 
No, I have a note from a doctor. 
You mean you have a printer and the Internet. 
Admit it, and the dog can stay. 
It's really hard meeting guys. 
There's a good boy. 
I'll get you a cookie. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Is it just me, or does Han sound kind of sexy when he speaks korean? 
Looks like Han, sounds like Barry White. 
Who was that, Han? 
Do you have a hot, new korean girlfriend? 
Yeah, someone who really likes you and is $1.50 
for the first minute and $2 for each additional minute? 
I was talking to my mother! 
So... yes? 
I was not talking hot. 
I was apologizing. 
She's still angry I left home. 
She thinks I'm freewheeling American who takes drugs and has intercourse with dirty kardashian. 
Does she know you buy your sweaters at build-a-bear? 
Well, I don't know a lot about the korean culture, but maybe you should stand up for yourself and stop apologizing to your mother. 
Yeah, what do you even have to apologize for? 
You must have been the easiest birth ever. 
She could've coughed you into a catcher's mitt. 
I'm making a cappuccino, you want one? 
Nope, I can't have any caffeine. 
I have to keep my system clean. 
I'm doing a drug trial tomorrow. 
Max, not one of those places where they use you as a Guinea pig to test for side effects of new drugs that go on the market? 
Or, as I like to call it, getting paid $500 to, uh, roll the side effects dice and hope it lands on hallucinations. 
I would never do something like that. 
I consider my body a temple. 
Didn't I see your "temple" eat a bag of flaming hot cheetos two nights ago? 
And that was a huge mistake. 
I still have a little... 
Burny heinie. 
And besides, think of all the people who are lowering their cholesterol safely because of me. 
Or the people who aren't taking klamitra because of me. 
I never heard of klamitra. 
You're welcome. 
I know klamitra. 
Sexy black woman who teaches my spin class. 
Uh, hello, uh, maybe you can help me. 
I'm looking for Caroline channing. 
I have a legal matter to discuss with her. 
Never heard of her. 
Never seen her. 
 Mr. hutchinson? 
 Never took an oath. 
Oh, my God, Mr. hutchinson, hi. 
I haven't seen you since my father's scandal broke and they were dragging you out of your law offices. 
Can I hug you? 
I mean, it's been so long since I've seen anyone from my old life. 
But, uh, not too hard. 
Ever since the scandal, I've had acid reflux. 
Didn't you used to be taller? 
No, uh, prouder. 
Oh, uh, Mr. hutchinson, 
this is my friend, Max. 
Max, this is Leo hutchinson, one of my father's attorneys. 
Oh, I've never known a lawyer who wasn't court-appointed for me. 
Well, except for the ones on law & order. 
Have you ever been on that show? 
No, I'm a real lawyer. 
You look like someone who was on that show. 
Are you sure you didn't represent the woman who ate her child? 
I've never represented anyone who ate their child. 
On law & order. 
Caroline, I'm sorry to drag you into this, but the prosecutor is asking for you to give a deposition regarding your father's case. 
Anything I can do to help? 
I'm pretty courtroom savvy. 
I mean, I haven't seen every episode of law & order, just, like, 400 of them. 
For instance, the, uh, judge's hammer? 
Not called a hammer. 
Reflux! Oh! 
Sorry. 
I just... I need to 
take a rylindia. 
Ah, rylindia. 
Does that work? 
 Hmm. 
 You're welcome. 
Well, thank you for coming all the way out here. 
I know I'm in good hands with you representing me. 
Uh, well, Caroline, as much as I would love to help you and your legal associate here, uh, the firm won't let me do it for free. 
I mean, your father's case bankrupted us practically, and my standard rate is $1,100 an hour. 
You know I don't have that kind of money. 
Last week, I gave myself a bikini wax with duct tape I stole from the diner. 
I'm gonna need another rylindia. 
Oh, don't take two of those in under an hour unless you want to have an orgasm every time you yawn. 
You're welcome again. 
Mr. hutchinson, 
I need you to do this. 
You can make this go away as easily as possible. 
Please don't make me beg. 
The floor's gross, and my skirt's too short. 
Counselor, at this juncture, I am going to need to take miss channing and have a sidebar over near the bar bar. 
How fun is this, by the way? 
I'm, like, your lawyer now. 
Oh, real fun. 
About as fun as that bikini wax. 
And then I had to spend $14 on neosporin. 
Don't worry, I know how you can make $500 in one night. 
I've been telling her that since she got here. 
Max, I am not doing a drug trial. 
Besides, it's not enough money anyway. 
No, but after I put in my $500, plus we take $100 from the cupcake fund. 
You would do that for me? 
You know, I always thought we'd have to use the cupcake money to get us out of a legal problem. 
I just thought it'd be for you. 
Me too! 
Welcome aboard, drug buddy. 
I can't believe I'm doing a drug trial. 
I won't even use stevia. 
It'll be fun! 
Just think of it as a middle-school sleepover. 
But with drugs. 
Yeah, a middle-school sleepover. 
So when you did this before, you never got any side effects, right? 
Well, no negative ones. 
I used to be an "a" cup. 
Wow, everybody looks so normal. 
This is more like sorority row than skid row. 
Hi! 
I'm Katie. 
Just found out there's three to a room, and I was wondering if you guys have chosen a roomie yet. 
Wait, there's three in a room? 
Yeah, I know. 
You want to be careful who you get. 
Anyways, I'm a self-mutilator, and, um, I was wondering if you could keep an eye on me. 
Just wrestle anything out of my hands that's sharp. 
Uh, you know what, Katie? 
We are self-mutilators too. 
So, uh, we kind of have our hands full. 
Yeah, we're gonna be super-busy self-mutilating ourselves. 
No worries. 
Max, you should have told me about the bed situation. 
Untested experimental drugs is one thing, but three to a room? 
That's barbaric! 
It'll be fine! 
We just have to pick the right girl. 
What about, uh, the one in the raincoat? 
She looks stuck-up, like she'd talk about herself all night. 
Yeah, we already got one of those. 
What about, uh... 
What about Bob Marley shirt? 
She looks like she smells. 
 Confirmed. 
 Right there. 
That's who we want. 
She looks smart and like she'd mind her own business. 
Hey! 
What are you up to? 
Nothing. 
Just minding my own business. 
Hey, want to be our roommate? 
Oh, I just said yes to a self-mutilator, but I can get out of it. 
She probably loves rejection. 
All right, ladies, listen up! 
 Hey, Max! 
 Hi, Toby. 
Heads-up, me, her, and, uh... 
Excuse me, what's your name? 
Oh, it's cool, we don't have to do, like, the name thing. 
A girl after my own heart! 
 We're roommates. 
 Got it. 
Now, since most of you have done this before, I'll make it quick. 
Half of you will get a placebo. 
The other half will be a testing a new drug called gladiva, and no, that's not my stage name down at the clubs. 
Okay, possible side effects may occur over the next 24 to 48 hours. 
They are... 
Drum roll please... 
Headaches, vomiting, flatulence, tongue-swelling, suicidal thoughts... 
I'm having some right now. 
 Itw... 
 Inability to walk. 
Mm, I hope we get that 'cause that's the only thing that's gonna keep me here. 
And ru... 
Relentless urination. 
Fatigue, seizures... 
Camel toe. 
I'm kidding. 
That's my joke. 
That's his joke. 
Good, 'cause I was out the door. 
Also, tg, eb, ccs... 
You want me to explain those to you? 
Not until you see one happening to me. 
And A.L. 
Anal leakage. 
The Grande Dame of side effects. 
Well, bottoms up. 
Max, don't say that after "anal leakage." 
See? This is fun! 
Getting paid to eat cookies and play the game of life. 
 Your turn. 
 What's the point? 
Clearly, I've already lost the game of life 'cause I'm sitting in a drug trial waiting for my "A" to "L". 
Well, if your "A" does start to "L," you're on the bottom bunk. 
I gotta pee. 
Ruh-roh. 
What? 
Mm, it's probably nothing, but she might be experiencing ru. 
What's that again? 
Relentless urination. 
She just said she had to pee. 
Yeah, that's relentless. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. 
"Ru" sure? 
Okay, your turn to spin. 
No more games. 
I really want to be prepared for this deposition. 
Can you read me the questions Mr. hutchinson sent? 
Mm-hmm. 
"State your full name." 
Caroline Wesbox Channing. 
Your middle name is "Wesbox"? 
It was my grandfather's name. 
It also might be a side effect. 
"I just slept with a dude who gave me Wesbox!" 
Max, can you just ask me the next question? 
Do you have any owledge of investor capital from the channing investment group being transferred to offshore banks? 
I had no knowledge of it. 
 You're boring. 
 I'm boring? 
I'm just saying, I'd change the channel. 
This is a bad one. 
Max, it's not law & order. 
I'll say it isn't. 
Look, tomorrow, you gotta give them something. 
Open your shirt, hike up your skirt, show them your Wesbox. 
"Did you know anything about your father  "illegally siphoning funds?" 
 No. 
"Have you ever had any conversations with your father regarding said transactions?" 
No. 
"Is your ass leaking right now?" 
No. 
Ruh-roh. 
toilet flushes] Nope. 
How we doing, ladies? 
Any side effects? 
Max, are you awake? 
Max! 
Quiet, you're gonna wake up pissy spacek. 
I can't sleep. 
My hearts keeps racing. 
You should tell Toby. 
It's probably a side effect. 
No, I'm nervous. 
I can't stop thinking about the deposition and about my father. 
Can I come down and talk? 
Not a great time. 
I kind of have people over. 
Get in here. 
What's wrong? 
I'm scared about tomorrow. 
I'm scared I'm gonna say the wrong thing and make things worse for my father. 
Look, all you have to do is answer the questions as carefully as they suggested and then throw in a wink, forget to wear panties. 
He'll be fine. 
But that's the thing. 
The questions don't say anything about my father. 
They're so cut and dry. 
They're only asking me details about things I know nothing about, and they're not interested in the things I do know about him. 
That he's warm, and funny, and generous, and loving. 
Like when I was little, and he and I would take our plane to our chalet in deer valley. 
Stop. You might as well 
rephrase that to "when he and I would take our guilty to our guilty in guilty valley." 
Every morning, before we went skiing, he would get up really early and make me his snowflake cinnamon french toast. 
Sounds amazing. 
And as he dusted the cinnamon and sugar on top, he'd say, "look, sweetheart, it's snowing, snowing just for you." 
And then he'd cut it into these little pieces... 
See? I can't even 
get the words out. 
No one will ever hear them. 
No one will know. 
I'll know. 
I heard them. 
Another round? 
Yeah, I'm just gonna bring my pillow in there. 
I don't think Gladiva's gonna make it to the market. 
We'll be doing the deposition in here. 
Oh, wow, this is exactly how it looks on law & order! 
Ooh! Ooh! 
There's the tiny typewriter thing where the actress who never gets to speak sits! 
Leo, Leo, take my picture near the tiny typewriter. 
Ladies, ladies. 
We only have an hour. 
We're already behind because you were late. 
Sorry, we had to stop at the check-cashing place. 
Yeah, and then a store to get diapers for a friend. 
There, $1,000. 
No fuss, and luckily, no muss. 
Max, do you have the $100 from the cupcakes? 
Yeah. 
Uh, 40... 60... 
80... 90... 
5, 6, 7, and... 
100. 
Mr. hutchinson, 
are you having reflux? 
No, I-it just became clear to me what I do for a living. 
Okay, uh, Caroline, if you're ready, I can bring them in. 
Remember, just stick to the questions and don't embellish. 
I prepped her last night, Leo. 
All right, let's go, Max. 
Actually, I want her to stay. 
I'm nervous, and she makes me feel better. 
Yes, I'm her registered emotional companion. 
Well, this is a legal proceeding, and that's a highly unusual request. 
But not improbable. 
We googled it. 
Yeah, she's allowed to have an emotional companion, as long as both attorneys agree. 
Well, I graduated top of my class at Harvard, but since you googled it, I'll try to make that happen. 
No, I am unaware of any of the transactions you just mentioned. 
Thank you, miss channing. 
Now, if you'll just bear with me a little while longer, I only have a couple more pertinent questions. 
Your voice is unbelievable. 
You could be on law & order. 
Max! 
Withdrawn. 
Miss channing, do you have any knowledge of embezzlement of any kind taking place at the channing investment group? 
No, I had no knowl... 
Of any su... 
Could you repeat that? 
Ruh-roh. 
You're having a side effect! 
Tongue swelling. 
Ts! 
Uh, counselor, give us one second. 
What is going on? 
We took drugs. 
Did she just say "we took drugs"? 
Very good, Leo. 
You must play charades. 
Look, we did a drug trial to get money for this. 
What's the holdup, counselor? 
Just give her some water. 
I had this once. 
It goes away in an hour. 
You said you never had any side effects! 
Oh, please. 
I died once. 
I just didn't want to scare you. 
Miss channing, are you aware of any accounts opened under any names other than your father's? 
Just drink the water. 
One sec. 
Uh, does anyone have a napkin or a bib? 
$1,100, you gotta have a bib around here somewhere. 
All right, what's going on here? 
I was just, uh, informed my client was part of a drug test within the last 24 hours. 
Drug test, Leo? 
That's a good one. 
Just another rich girl on drugs. 
Get her into rehab, and we'll have to reschedule. 
We'll have to do this another time. 
No, no, no, no, no, no! 
No, no! 
She's right! 
We don't have the money to do this another Tim look, I can tell you right now, she does not know anything. 
She doesn't know about the money, she doesn't know about transactions. 
She doesn't know anything about anything. 
We are paid up for three more minutes, and we are going to use them! 
She can't talk, but I know what she would want to say. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the... room, 
she would want you to know who her father really is. 
He used to make her snow toast! 
And in her words, he was funny, smart, and a generous lover. 
Generous and loving! 
Oh, sorry, yes, yes. 
Generous and loving. 
Now, I don't know her father, and I have never met him... 
And I would like you to put that on the record, actress who's never allowed to talk... 
But I do know her, and she's an amazing person. 
And her father raised her alone, so he must be an amazing person too. 
Well... 
That accomplished nothing. 
Counselor, what do we do here? 
We take a short recess until she can speak, and resume the deposition, on me, because her father is an amazing guy, and... 
That's what they would do on law & order. 
Fine, we'll break for an hour. 
Seriously, you sound like a superhero's boss. 
Max, you're the best. 
I know. 
I did pretty good, right? 
I should've gone to law school. 
Or High School. 
Permission to enter the judge's chambers? 
Permission granted. 
Excuse the tubs of bleu cheese. 
They're being held as evidence in the case against eating here. 
I wanted to thank you for everything you did. 
And I know you were gonna buy yourself a treat with the drug money... 
Yeah, like drugs. 
So I got you a little something. 
It's the complete law & order box set! 
No way! 
That's not a little something. 
That's, like, $500. 
Or $30 on the subway. 
And the guy said most of them are in english. 
Awesome! 
Freezer adjourned. 
﻿1 Hi, it's been 20 minutes. 
Have you decided? 
Uh, we still need more time, can you come back? 
Sure. And I'm back. 
Come on guys you're not buying a house. 
Everything sucks. 
Pick the thing that sucks the least, and put it in you mouth. 
Max, everyone keeps telling me they can't decide, it's like a support group for bi-sexuals. 
Something very magical about to happen... 
Please let it be the rapture. 
I need a day off. 
In two minutes, something very hip is happening. 
If you have a camera, make sure the flash is on. 
Why is he speaking like that? 
Wait a minute. 
No one's ordering. 
People keep checking the time on their phones. 
Everyone's wearing matching new balance sneakers. 
Flash mob! 
 Party rockers in the house tonight   whoo! 
Everybody just...  
Oh, hell, no! 
Caroline, Earl, code red! 
 Make you lose your mind   everybody just have a good time   let's go   party rockers in the...  
I couldn't stop disco, but I'll be damned if any more of that crap gets by me. 
Why is flash mob over? 
Flash mobs were over a year ago. 
Nobody told Han! 
I want so bad to be hip. 
Start by never saying that again. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Hello? 
Max, phone! 
No! 
What are you doing? 
Never answer the wall phone! 
What? Why? 
Only two people call the wall... 
collection agencies and the landlord, looking for the original tenant whose name is on the lease! 
 Hang up. Quick! 
 Too late. 
I've got to man up and face it. 
Hello? 
This is what collection agency? 
No, my granddaughter Max is not here. 
She died. 
On her deathbed, she said it was the stress of being constantly harassed by creditors. 
That's juvenile. 
Give me the phone. 
Hi. 
So sorry about that. 
What's the issue exactly? 
Well, I'm sure she has every intention... 
mm-hmm. 
Mm-hmm. 
Mm-hmm. 
Oh. 
Well, you're a doody head. 
Never answer the wall. 
But what are you gonna do about it? 
You can't just keep lying to collection agencies. 
You have to pay your bills. 
I have a system. 
I pay everyone five dollars a week... 
just enough to keep them from freaking out. 
It's the methadone-clinic banking system. 
That is a complete waste of money. 
Five dollars won't even cover the interest you're accruing. 
What's the interest rate on your credit card? 
Don't know, but my interest rate in the conversation is zero. 
Max, how could you not know that? 
That's one of the first things my father taught me about finance. 
Where... 
at Embezzle U.? 
Max, I interned at Merrill Lynch. 
Let me help you with this. 
It's the least I can do. 
I had nowhere to go. 
You took me in. 
Let me repay my debt to you by helping with your debt to everyone in the world, apparently. 
If you keep talking, I'm going to Merrill Lynch myself. 
I'm one of those people who gets off on untangling big, complicated messes. 
And since you won't let me do your hair, let me do your bills. 
You want to do my bills? 
Here's my portfolio. 
And, uh, if you find chocolate sprinkles in there, they're not chocolate... 
Or sprinkles. 
Okay. 
I've divided your bills into three categories... 
"impossible," "next to impossible," and "how the hell did that happen?" 
And I've divided my roommate into three categories... 
"annoying," "super annoying," and "how the hell did that happen?" 
I'm closing kitchen in ten minutes. 
I cannot stay later. 
I have date with new woman in my life. 
She's very special to me. 
I think she may be the one. 
You are both welcome to come watch us have sex. 
Just putting it out there. 
Just put it back in there. 
I'm so excited, I don't even know where to start. 
Drumroll, please. 
No? 
Okay. 
Oh, interesting. 
Here we have a bill from the pet castle, yet you don't have a pet, and you've never been to a castle... 
Oh, except white castle. 
You used a credit card at white castle? 
Yep. 
That was good weed. 
And the pet thing was 'cause I found a stray and had to have her cleaned up before I could get anyone to take her. 
That would also explain the charge for neutering. 
Nah, actually, that was for me. 
Can't have any more of these coming out. 
Do you really think it's fiscally smart to be taking in strays? 
Good point. 
Move out tonight. 
What is this... 
a student loan? 
Oh, my God. 
Max, you went to college? 
That wasn't a judgment. 
It was just shocking... 
kind of like seeing a baby smoke on the Internet. 
I love that kid. 
Max, a student loan is the worst bill you can ignore. 
It can never be expunged. 
We're breaking out "expunged" on a weeknight? 
You can't run away from this bill. 
I can run away from anything. 
I'm on my fifth identity. 
It's just like that but underwater! 
Guys! 
Sorry, we're just closing, guys. 
I'll take them, Max. 
We need the... 
uh, sit anywhere. 
What was that roadrunner move you just pulled? 
There's still a smoke outline of your body Hanging in the air out there. 
Did Wile E. Coyote 
just come in the diner? 
 No, but my exboyfriend did. 
Meep, meep. 
Why is William in Brooklyn? 
Why is William in this diner? 
Why is every inbred rich guy named William? 
I don't want to see him. 
Max, close the door. 
I don't want him to come in here. 
Yeah, 'cause that happens all the time. 
Customers come in the front door and make a beeline through the kitchen to see if there's a waitress hiding in the walk-in freezer. 
Okay, what is the deal? 
Tell me fast. 
I'm nipping like crazy in here. 
Ooh, you're smuggling some gumdrops there, too, ice queen. 
His name is William Van Horn, and he's... 
I am leaving for sex. 
Last chance for threesome, foursome, possibly fivesome, if her sister's train gets in on time. 
Oleg, please. 
I don't have time to be harassed right now. 
Oh, okay. 
I'll see you and the gumdrops tomorrow. 
Story. Go. 
We met at our parents' companies' parent company picnic. 
His family is the Boston Van Horns... 
story. 
Stop. 
Cut to the end. 
Do we hate him? 
He dumped me when I lost all my money... 
never called me, not an email, nothing. 
Oh, we hate him. 
Wait. Which one's your ex... 
the Asian one, the black one? 
I'm kidding. 
No, seriously. 
The white one or the really, really white one? 
Really, really white. 
Service, service, service, service, service, serv... 
you heard your bro. 
Service him. 
Oh, crushed! 
Hey, you better be careful, 'cause I can give you a run for your money. 
I don't have any money. 
Well, with a body like that, you don't need any. 
 Oh! Babam! 
Did you actually think that was a good line, or is that what you do so the check gets paid by Richie Rich? 
Hold on. 
Who said I was rich? 
 Let me see your Hands. 
 What... 
looking to see if I have poor-people calluses? 
No, I wanted to see how big your penis is. 
With Hands that size, you better be rich. 
Oh! Shazam! 
Not cool, bro. 
 What's your name? 
 Michelle Obama. 
We're closed. 
I'm William. 
Give me your number. 
Why? So you can put it 
in your phone and never call or text or email? 
Seriously. 
You wouldn't know what to do with a good girl if you had one. 
But you're not a good girl. 
That's why I want your number. 
So how about it? 
We're closed. 
 Your sign says "open till 2:00." 
My, my. 
How time does fly. 
2:00, gentlemen... 
nighty night. 
What did I ever do to you? 
You didn't mention me, did you? 
Ugh, no. 
I just gave him... 
just get to the end. 
Do you hate him? 
I hate him. 
That was the weirdest thing, seeing him come in here. 
No, the weirdest thing is coming in here right now. 
Why no? 
Girl at urban outfitter said it was hip. 
You look like a lesbian I made out with once on a dare. 
Han, you're adorable exactly as you are. 
Why are you trying to be hip? 
To meet girls. 
Oh! 
It's not that bad in here. 
I thought my first trip to a laundromat would be a lot more depressing. 
Six years we spent together, and now he won't even look at me. 
Oh, not the bag. 
I just looked at his bag... 
now yours? 
Max, it's driving me crazy. 
What did you major in in college? 
I majored in changing topics. 
So what did you ever see in your ex, the lost Winklevoss twin? 
We're not talking about William. 
We're talking about your bills. 
Well, I'm talking about your bill! 
Oh, face! 
Max... 
We're trying to start a cupcake business. 
And I can't believe I'm about to say this but with my father's financial baggage, you're our best chance for credit. 
Listen, everybody's broke in their 20s. 
And everybody hides from stuff. 
You run into freezers. 
I practice ignorance and blackout drinking. 
What's happening right now? 
Hola, dudarinos. 
The laundromat's closing early. 
We've rented it out for our '80s pop-up disco party. 
Bobby. 
 Shouldn't it be called an "'80s pop-up lame hipster will do anything to be ironic and lame" party? 
"Lame"? 
Don't think so. 
What? 
Vicki from small wonder is coming? 
Oh! 
Embarrassed to be you right now. 
Unless you chicks have 75 disco-lovin' bucks, be gone in ten minutes, or my man here will throw you out. 
Don't let his tube top fool you. 
Bobby is mad wiry. 
I'm wiry. 
Small wonder? 
Is that the show on TLC about the little-people magicians? 
No. 
It's an '80s sitcom about this little girl robot who lives with a loving family. 
A girl robot? 
That's totally unbelievable. 
No, that's totally awesome! 
The unbelievable part is the loving family. 
I love Vicki. 
She had no emotions and was empty inside. 
My role model! We're staying. 
$75? 
To do what... 
stand here and dance next to... 
Guy-girl and girl-guy over there? 
Come on, Chestnut, go poo-poo near the hipsters. 
Hey, how cool would it be if we could get Chess to go poo on a hipster? 
How can all of those people have $75 just to dance at a laundromat? 
I've been doing my roots with white-out. 
Hipsters in Williamsburg will pay for anything if it makes them feel like they're in on something new no one else knows about. 
All you need's a gimmick. 
Dudes! 
Can we ride your horse? 
Sure. 
100 bucks. 
Okay. 
I got to go to the ATM. 
Wait. Stay right there. 
We'll be right back. 
Oh, my God. 
Max, we are literally looking our gift horse in the mouth. 
We have something that's better than an '80s disco party. 
We have a horse. 
If we throw a big enough party, charge hipsters for horse rides, we could pay off your student loan! 
You'd whore out Chestnut like that? 
Don't you have to get him hooked on heroin first? 
Max, I've got this. 
I'm a brilliant event planner. 
My sweet 16 was off the chain... 
penthouse party, pink and black theme. 
Alanis Morissette sang songs from jagged little pill. 
On my 16th birthday, my mom took too many jagged little pills, and I had to drive her to the emergency room to get her stomach pumped. 
Was your childhood based on the novel Push by Sapphire? 
I wish! 
The theme is '90s horse party. 
It's exactly the kind of hip event you're dying to be a part of. 
It would happen after closing, so it won't affect business. 
And all the horse rides will take place out back. 
So no damage will come to the diner. 
But why would I say yes to giving up my diner for no cash return? 
You might get laid. 
Great! 
The '90s horse party is happening on Thursday. 
Fantastic. 
Any other questions? 
Yes. 
What exactly is possibility of percentage of me... 
Getting laid? 
All I can say is, with the cute '90s-themed-clothing incentive and the trivia contest, lots of cute hipster girls will be here looking to... 
Get laid! 
I will go now and start to research American trivia facts about the 1990s. 
You realize we're gonna have to give him something... 
like flash a little boob, something. 
I feel like Han's more of an ass man. 
Good point... 'cause his head 
is right there. 
 Creep   oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, yeah   creep, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I  Oleg, what's up? 
Not enjoying the '90s horse party? 
I thought you said "'90s whores party." 
Now I'm wearing girdle and deodorant for no reason. 
Quite a turnout, Max. 
Reminds me of the after-hours clubs I used to go to, you know, if all the cool cats shooting dope were replaced by sad, white fools sipping light beer. 
Look! 
I did research and make myself a 1990s trivia t-shirt. 
"Talk to the Han." 
Get it? 
"Talk to the Han!" 
That actually is cool. 
I am hoping it will help me... 
Get laid? 
Care to purchase a tamagotchi or a 90210-reo cupcake? 
We came here wanting to hate on you chicks hard. 
But that horse you got out back is mad cool. 
You bested us, party beast. 
And to that, I doff my cap. 
 How much are the cupcakes? 
 $10 each. 
Ooh, I doff my cap again, milady. 
Max, look at all this. 
We're a success! 
I'll tell you what's not a success... 
the plan to get Han some action. 
Look at him over there. 
 That's so sad. 
 I know. 
Go over there and give him a "Han" job. 
William! 
Meep, meep. 
You realize this is a freezer, not a panic room, right? 
Just go out there and tear his smug, white ass a new one. 
I can't face him, Max. 
Why? He's the one 
who didn't call you. 
I can't face him because I'm a waitress. 
Last time he saw me, I was a billionaire in a townhouse. 
Now I'm a waitress in a walk-in freezer. 
So, when you were laying around on your trust fund, doing nothing every day, having other people scrub your toilet, you could hold your head up high? 
But now that you support yourself by earning your own money, that's somehow shameful? 
Who cares what he thinks? 
He is the guy who just paid $100 to party with a horse. 
He's the loser, not you. 
Really? 'Cause he's 
out there having fun, and I'm in here, hugging a tub of expired blue cheese. 
Look... 
You see that wad of cash in your Hand? 
You earned that. 
Slap that wad in your palm a few times! 
Feel its power. 
That's all you got? 
Come on, really squeeze that wad! 
Feels good in your Hands, right? 
 Feels pretty good. 
 Yeah. 
Now slap it and say, "this is my wad!" 
This is my wad. 
This is my wad! 
This is my wad! 
Go out there. 
I'm going out there! 
As soon as the ladies calm down. 
Are you kidding? 
Show him what he's missing. 
Let 'em pop, playa! 
Where are you, you rich poseur? 
Oh! Uh... 
Listen up! 
That was meant exclusively for one specific rich poseur. 
All you other rich poseurs, just continue with the '90s! 
Whoop, whoop! 
Where is he? 
Do you see him? 
Uh, no. 
He was right over there. 
He's gone. 
I don't get to shove this in his face. 
It would've been nice to put my wad in his face for a change. 
Oh, speaking of wads, look over there. 
Aw. 
He's such a little pimp. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. 
Actually, I am. 
I guess I didn't need to go over there and make some big, dramatic speech, telling him that even though I'm a waitress, I'm better than him. 
I know that now. 
Thank you. 
And when I see him one day in the future, I'll be happy to tell him that. 
He just came out of the men's room. 
Let's get out of here! 
What? I thought 
you wanted to talk to him! 
I said, "the future." 
This is the '90s. 
Let's get out of here. 
Run! 
Feels good running away from your bill, huh? 
So great. 
See, that's what I've been saying. 
Well, at least you don't have to run from your student loan bill. 
We can pay that off and still have $50 for the cupcake fund. 
I hate that college won. 
Didn't you get anything out of it? 
You mean, besides mono and an art teacher whose idea of finger-painting was a little more "finger" than "painting"? 
Art teacher? 
Max, was that your major... art? 
Keep your eyes on the road. 
You're driving. 
I just thought for, like, a second, I could maybe illustrate children's books. 
Max, that's so sweet. 
You're not like Vicki at all. 
Max, look. 
Han! 
Aw, our little somethin'-somethin' got him a little somethin'-somethin'! 
I doff my cap, milady! 
﻿1 Wow! Bummer, dude. 
You have a time machine? 
And somehow, it got programmed to this crap diner? 
I must admit, I am quite taken with steampunk. 
Oh, steampunk, right. 
I remember that trend. 
It happened for, like, ten seconds back in 2000 and-are-you-kidding-me? 
Dude, seriously, you're sitting in a public place tap-tap-tapping on an oldie typewriter? 
What are you? 
In the league of extraordinarily pretentious gentlemen? 
Aren't you being a little aggressive? 
Yup. 
That's how people are here in the present where we live. 
But don't get me wrong. 
I'd like to go back in time, too. 
Maybe stop 9/11 or that creep who had sex on my shoe, but I can't. 
Present? 
Where's that uniform from? 
Like, 1998? 
Oh, stop, or I'm going to have to shoot you with a Smith & Wesson I'm currently packing in my bloomers. 
I'll go get thee a menu, my good man. 
attention, everyone. 
Max and I have a little late-night treat for you. 
Don't say it all excited like that. 
Now when it's not drugs, Earl's going to be pissed. 
You are invited to a very important taste-test of Max's homemade cupcakes. 
Okay, but I will have only one. 
When I get a tummy, single ladies call me Buddha and rub me for luck. 
I gotta watch out, too. 
Last time I had Max's chocolate espresso cupcake before going home, I was awake till 5:00 A.M., 
hand washing all my thongs. 
Thongs? 
Earl, you devil. 
That's right, just because there's snow on the roof doesn't mean there's not swing in the sling. 
Oh, Caroline, darling. 
Can you go back over there? 
I forgot my racing form. 
Oh, horse racing? 
It reminds me of Chestnut. 
Max... Chestnut. 
What's with the sad face? 
Your horse is living it up at a fancy stable nearby. 
Not gone to the great stud farm in the sky. 
Did someone say "stud farm"? 
My fee is $10 a quart or $15 if you want a boy. 
Wow. 
You bounced back from your Sophie breakup pretty quick. 
It was not a real breakup. 
I will have her very soon again. 
Right now, I lay low and wait in bushes like determined jungle cat. 
Or a rapist. 
Racing forms, here you go. 
Earl, maybe some time you will take me out to the track with you. 
I used to ride horses all the time in Korea. 
The mechanical ones for a quarter in front of supermarkets? 
Actually, Max, I'm a very good rider. 
In fact, I was training to be a jockey but was too short. 
Too short to be a jockey? 
That's a hard hit, my man. 
Han, I had no idea you loved horses, too. 
Why didn't you ever say anything? 
Well, why didn't you ever ask about any of my interests? 
I'll tell you why. 
Because all you ever talk about is "our cupcake business," our cupcake business." 
Doesn't your cd have other tracks? 
Anyway, our cupcake business has a very important meeting tomorrow with Paul Platt, the party planner. 
I know a party planner, too. 
He sells J .Lo. 
and Salma Hayek Pinatas off back of truck for Cinco de Mayo. 
Awesome. 
Put me down for a Hayek. 
More storage space for candy. 
Well, our party planner is the it guy in Manhattan. 
And tomorrow, Max and I are doing a tasting for him at his office. 
How can someone be too short to be a jockey? 
Isn't that the whole point? 
Are you all right, Max? 
I got here as fast as I could. 
Caroline texted me to hurry over because you didn't know you were pregnant, and you were giving birth over toilet. 
So I grabbed my plunger and ran! 
That is insane. 
I never texted that. 
No, I did, when I stole your phone. 
I needed a reason to get Sophie over here. 
I can't believe she believed it. 
Oh, come on, Max. 
Giving birth over toilet? 
That is very you. 
Now that you are here, Sophie, sit. 
I want to tell you something important. 
Well, you can forget that. 
There's no way I'm going to stay. 
A cupcake party? 
Oh, look, and this one even has a pretzel in it. 
Yup, that's our "salty n' spice" for our more adventurous customers. 
Also for the uptight white people, we have the very, very vanilla which is... big surprise... 
My favorite. 
And this is our beer-batter maple bacon spring break cupcake. 
That's for stoners, and big surprise, my favorite. 
We can only take four flavors to represent our cupcake business. 
See? Not one word ever 
about anyone else. 
I have a pet ferret, if anyone gives a damn. 
Well, I have some big news I want to share with you all as well. 
Sophie, that classy lady right over there... 
Mm, I like this one. 
She recently broke it off with me because she wanted to be with a man who had a dream and a drive. 
So I have bought a drive... 
A Lincoln town car. 
Yes, I have a new car service and slogan: "Lie back and I will ride you till you tell me to stop." 
So, oleg, you now have a town car business? 
And Sophie, you rent town cars all the time. 
Oh, oh, please. 
I mean, I love pizza, too, but that doesn't mean I have to marry papa John. 
I was just thinking, you might want to come out back and take a look at the light-up makeup mirror on visors. 
Light-up makeup mirror? 
Oh, I might be interested. 
But not just you and I. 
Han will come as well. 
Finally! Han is getting 
invited to something. 
Other than LinkedIn. 
 So much for the taste test. 
 It's fine. 
I know what's best for our cupcake business. 
I do say that a lot, but I think it's kind of charming. 
I'll go get our coats. 
Mm, mm, mm. 
Look at you. 
I must say, I'm impressed with how far you've come. 
Well, you burn a few thousand cupcakes, you're bound to get better. 
Not just the cupcakes, Max. 
Look how far you've come. 
When I think of that girl who came in here just looking to get by... 
Hey, and check you out now. 
Big, fancy meeting in Manhattan. 
Lordy lord! 
 It's only a meeting, Earl. 
 Maybe. 
But if you were one of these horses, I'd put all of my money on you, Max. 
Paul Platt parties. 
Please hold. 
Paul Platt parties. 
Please hold. 
Paul Platt parties. 
Please hold. 
   Poor kid. 
If I had that job, I'd be asking someone to please hold a gun to my head. 
He's probably excited to be working for Paul Platt. 
Look at all these magazines calling him the next Martha Stewart. 
Someday, we'll have articles about us. 
You know, pictures of you and me standing outside our country home. 
Hold on. 
We're rich and still living together? 
Okay, she's leaving. 
This is us. 
About time. 
Been sitting here so long my ass is asleep, which kind of goes against my theory that it won't quit. 
Hi, Paul's going to be a little longer. 
It's fine. 
It's just... 
Paul Platt parties, please hold. 
 Paul Platt parties... 
 How much longer... 
 Please hold. 
 Me or them? 
I got the ass pins and needles. 
 Max. 
 What? We're on hold. 
Have a seat. 
Five more minutes. 
Paul Platt parties. 
The word "party" at a party planner's? 
Little obvious. 
Like me having art that says "will die alone." 
Wait. 
I think this is Johnny's art. 
No way. 
"No way" is right. 
Johnny's a nobody. 
Paul Platt wouldn't have a framed "Johnny" in his office. 
Look, signed "j. Peg." 
That's his tag. 
Yo, what's the deal with this art? 
It's a street artist. 
Everyone's getting really into him now. 
Oh, yeah? 
He was trying to get into me a few months ago. 
It was more emotional than that. 
He cheated on his girlfriend with her and then blew her off. 
It was really hard for us. 
And you thought me slapping my ass in front of him was inappropriate? 
 Wow, Johnny made it. 
 Well, good for him. 
He's making it, we're making it... 
We're making it? 
I magic-markered over the scuffs on my boot, and we can't even get past the poor man's John Cusack over there. 
Max, we are making it. 
We've come a long way. 
We haven't used Starbucks napkins for toilet paper in months. 
And now, look where we are. 
We've got a meeting with Paul Platt. 
Say it: "We're making it." 
I'm serious. 
Say it, Max. 
We are making it. 
Okay, we're making it. 
 Caroline channing. 
 This is us! 
 Ahh. 
 What, five more minutes? 
Monday at 4:00. 
Something came up. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, Monday at 4:00. 
There's no Monday at 4:00. 
He said Monday at 4:00. 
Monday at 4:00, right? 
Absolutely. 
Monday at 4:00. 
There is no Monday at 4:00. 
I'm confused. 
Is there a Monday at 4:00? 
In the books, Monday at 4:00. 
Paul can't wait. 
There is no Monday at 4:00. 
I don't understand. 
Are we coming in Monday at 4:00? 
Absolutely. 
Paul's a big fan. 
Don't come in on Monday. 
Can you please tell me what's going on? 
See, it's this news about your father being moved to a cushy white collar prison this week. 
Paul can't have anything to do with someone named channing, 'cause everyone in New York is pissed. 
Look at all that. 
It never stops. 
How much more of this do I have to take? 
So we'll see you on Monday! 
Don't come. 
I woke my ass up for this? 
Mmm. 
This was delicious, Max. 
Here's a $20. 
Keep the change. 
What are you doing, Sophie? 
You don't pay for the cupcakes. 
No, take it for your business. 
Ever since your big party planner meeting went bust, I was worried that you two girls might form a joint suicide pact. 
Nah, we're not that organized. 
So how's Caroline today? 
She's handling it all better than I thought. 
She's with her father's lawyer right now, trying to figure out the best time for her to go out to the prison to see him before he's moved. 
Oh, that is my new phone. 
You know there's a phone stuck to that gay furby, right? 
Yes, this is from my favorite store on 14th street, rhinestoned. 
Oh, it's just a text from my driver. 
He's waiting out front. 
Why don't you just invite oleg inside? 
I'm not sure yet he deserves to come inside. 
Well, from what I heard, he's already come inside. 
Oh, Max, I love it when you're dirty! 
Hey, how'd it go? 
Well, according to my father's lawyer, the prison is surrounded by so much press that daddy doesn't want me to come out there and be exploited all over again. 
Why is he still the only news story out there? 
Well, the good news is, your hair is especially shiny today. 
It is? 
Thanks, Sophie. 
So try not to kill yourself. 
Well, if I didn't kill myself reading these in the car, I won't. 
Hate mail. 
It was being held at my old P.O. box. 
My father's lawyer picked it up for me. 
Why didn't he just punch you in the face and call it a day? 
I know, it's like the end of miracle on 34th street, only everyone's calling me a bitch. 
Oh, come on, not everyone is calling you a bitch. 
"Dear bitch, I hate you." 
"If I ever see you on the street, I will..." 
Shake your hand and wish you well, as you have been through so very much. 
That is not what that says. 
It might be. 
It's hard to read his actual words, as they are written in blood. 
Oh, look how fancy. 
This is not hate mail. 
No, this is invitation to metropolitan museum annual gala. 
It is? 
This is my favorite social event in all of New York. 
I've gone every year since I was 18. 
It's a fashion ball at the museum of art... 
Yeah, I know what it is. 
 I catered it last year. 
 Max, how weird. 
We were probably right in the very same room. 
Then there's a good chance I spit in your drink. 
Not really, unless you were acting all prissy and demanding. 
There's a good chance you spit in my drink. 
Well, see? 
This is happy news. 
No, as much as I want to, I can't go. 
Everybody hates me. 
And much worse, I have nothing to wear, and if you're gonna be hated, you better look damn good. 
I give up. That invitation 
finally broke me. 
Why are you pulling down your bed? 
Because I don't have a door to slam. 
Hell, I don't even have a door! 
Everything's been taken away, Max... 
My fortune, my business career, my social life, my sweet, sweet horse. 
Okay, take a nap. 
You're upset. 
You have a good reason to be. 
A good reason? 
I say she has 200, 300 good reasons. 
I mean, read these. 
These are like letters to the devil. 
I'm just going to get in there and never get out. 
Close it up, Max. 
Put me in the wall. 
No, it's really hard to close it when you're in there. 
I've tried. 
Look, I know it's not even remotely close to what you had before, but we do have our cupcake business and our purple stove, and we do have $922. 
And we're gonna make it. 
Wall me. 
Come on, all you need is a big, glamorous party. 
I mean, look at all the celebrities that are on the list: Martha Stewart, Justin Timberlake... 
Ooh, Hugh Jackman! 
Oh, I like to call him "huge" Jackman, because I bet he has a big penis. 
Wall me. 
   Thank you, sir. 
Welcome home, buddy. 
As you can see, we haven't put the pool in yet. 
We'll get to it. 
Tree, grill, shovel... 
Usual cast of characters. 
Now, I am going to take you in to her, but I should warn you. 
She hasn't been out of bed for two days, and that means no tooth brushing and it's bad up in there. 
I'm pretty sure horses have a keen sense of smell, so just be prepared. 
I missed you, too. 
    Max, I'm trying to sleep. 
Take your boots off. 
Caroline, I have something for you. 
Go away. 
I'm dead. 
Jeez, and you said my breath was bad. 
You have a visitor, someone you love. 
    Chestnut! 
Chestnut, hi, baby, hi. 
How did he get here? 
I went to peach and told her it was a matter of life and death and we had to have him back. 
And what, she just gave him back to you? 
Well, I did have to agree to come back and babysit one day a week for the rest of my life, but hell, Chestnut's home. 
Max, thank you so much. 
You brought me back to life. 
Oh, my God, don't exhale on me. 
Your breath is like you went down on a brussels sprout. 
Tip your head that way. 
Chestnut, Chestnut. 
Don't breathe on him either! 
His whole head is a nose. 
He can't handle that. 
Chestnut's home. 
Han, I'm so excited. 
Did you hear my horse is back? 
This is not conversation. 
This is just the other thing you say. 
"My cupcake business, my horse, my horse, my cupcake business." 
Well, in case anyone's interested, my ferret's name is Alvin. 
And Alvin's telling his friends he has a pet named han. 
Hey, Earl. 
Long time, no see. 
Well, well, well, Johnny. 
If it isn't the famous street artist. 
Well, I'm hardly famous. 
You got that right. 
My remark was laced with sarcasm. 
Can you tell Max I'm here? 
That depends. 
Are you still a two-timing bum? 
That's his name, don't wear it out. 
Hiya, slugger. 
Can you do me a favor and call Earl off? 
I may be on day six of my p90x, but I'm in no shape to take on a heavyweight like him. 
It's okay, Earl, we're cool. 
Well, I am. 
He's just riding my fumes. 
So, uh, where's your section? 
 Counter. 
 Hm, same ol', same ol'. 
Johnny's in the diner. 
Why is he here? 
It can't be to eat. 
He's "made it." 
He eats "made it food" now. 
Well, obviously, he's here to see you. 
Or else he won the award for biggest lying jerk in New York, and this is the first stop on his press tour. 
Well, I don't know why he's here, but you better come with me. 
He looks really good, so I'm not listening to a thing coming out of his pretty mouth. 
Well, I was gonna ask what the specials were, but you know what? 
Can I actually just get one of Max's homemade cupcakes? 
 Okay, which flavor? 
 Surprise me. 
Kind of like how you surprised her with your girlfriend? 
Okay, I'm starting to get a vibe here, and that's why I came in, because I feel bad, the way things went down between us, and I came to say good-bye because I'm moving. 
Oh, moving. 
To where? 
 Manhattan. 
 Manhattan? 
That hardly calls for a good-bye speech. 
It's over there. 
Yeah, I know, but it's a big change for me, and we're not going to be rolling in the same circles anymore, and I'm getting married... 
Over there. 
Well, at least you and your girlfriend worked it out. 
Actually, we broke up. 
This is someone I met a couple months ago. 
I was only watching his lips, but did they just say what I think they said? 
Well, there's your cupcake. 
That'll be $5. 
The price has gone up. 
Yeah, we're successful now. 
In fact, we may be working with Martha Stewart. 
Caroline knows her from, you know, before. 
We're gonna talk it over with her at the met gala ball that Caroline got invited to. 
Martha's on the committee. 
Caroline goes every year. 
Not a big deal. 
My first time. 
Not a big deal either. 
In fact, none of it's a big deal, just two girls who are making it but who choose to stay in Brooklyn 'cause we're cool. 
That's awesome, Max. 
That's awesome. 
It's just funny, because whenever I think of you, I think of you in this diner in that uniform. 
In a good way. 
You want money now? 
Yeah. 
It's business. 
It's not like we had a relationship or anything. 
In fact, you can pay Caroline. 
She's the money. 
I'm the artist. 
You know, I'm doing pretty well as an artist myself. 
I've been selling a lot of my stuff. 
Really? 
We hadn't heard. 
And there's your cupcake. 
In case you didn't notice, that container's to go. 
Got it. 
He's gone. 
I got rid of him. 
Max? 
What are you doing? 
Punching cheesecakes. 
It's my version of going to bed for two days. 
Are you more upset about the marriage thing or the uniform thing? 
Oh, this isn't about Johnny. 
I'm mad at the cheesecakes. 
They were supposed to have cherries on top, and I wanted cherries! 
Why not me? 
Okay, maybe it's half no cherries, half Johnny. 
Nothing ever does work out for us. 
And then I hear myself saying all that ridiculous stuff about us talking to Martha Stewart at the gala. 
I mean, what was that? 
It's insane. 
Is it? 
Wait, seriously, is it? 
Or is it just insane enough to be genius? 
Max, we have the invitation. 
She'll be there. 
Why are we wasting our time with Paul Platt when we can meet the real thing? 
We can take Martha our best cupcake, explain our situation, and maybe... 
Maybe she'll talk to us. 
I mean, she was a girl with a dream once, too, and she certainly understands hard times. 
You are talking about us stalking Martha Stewart. 
I am talking about us stalking Martha Stewart! 
I even have my gorgeous Judith leiber jeweled cupcake purse to smuggle the cupcake in. 
It's perfect. 
I knew there was a reason I took that from the townhouse. 
Great, you have a cupcake and a cupcake purse. 
What else are we gonna wear to the ball, cinderella? 
Are the rats in the alley gonna whip us up some ball gowns? 
I mean, it's not exactly like we have a fairy godmother. 
Hey, look, girls! 
I got myself a crown and a wand at rhinestoned. 
I'll have the soup in my booth. 
Well, this is as close to a fairytale as you and I are ever gonna get, so what the hell? 
Max, does that mean we're gonna find a way to go to the ball? 
Oh, yeah. 
Get your cupcake on, 'cause we're gonna get balled. 
Sophie, this is so generous of you to offer to buy us dresses for the gala, but as much as my shoes love being back  in their place of birth... 
 Oh, your shoes were born here? 
Mine were born in China, but I adopted them at payless. 
Maybe we should find something cheaper, at one of those consignment stores. 
"Consignment stores"? 
Come on, what are we, gypsies? 
This is big fancy ball. 
We need ball gowns. 
Never really been a fan of balls. 
In fact, always thought they got in the way, but here we are. 
Well, we do have to look amazing if we're approaching Martha Stewart with a cupcake, so we'll find a way to pay you back and start by doing some cleaning jobs for you for free. 
No! Every year 
I give money to charity, and I like you two girls way more than the babies with the broken smiles. 
So don't worry. 
I got plenty of cash. 
Aww, a roll of hundreds. 
Reminds me of my Christmas stocking stuffers. 
Yeah, this is fun day. 
I'm like Richard Gere and you're my two hookers. 
Well, when you put it like that, I'm a little more comfortable. 
Good afternoon. 
How can I help you? 
Hi, how are you? 
We don't have a lot of time. 
We have to be at work by 6:00. 
Can you show us your best formal spring couture? 
Perhaps you ladies might be more comfortable down in ready-to-wear. 
As I said, we're in a bit of a rush. 
We might move a little quicker if you dropped the attitude and picked up some dresses. 
Show her your wad. 
Let's look at some dresses. 
Yeah, and get us some champagne, like in the movies. 
 The patron, own, let's go get it on   the zone, own, yes, I'm in the zone   is it two, three, leave a good tip   I'm-a blow off my money and don't give two... 
 I'm on the floor, floor   I love to dance   so give me more, more   till I can't stand   get on the floor, floor   like it's your last chance   if you want more, more   then here I am   starships were meant to fly   hands up and touch the sky   can't stop, 'cause we're so high   let's do this one more time   starships were meant to fly   hands up and touch the sky   let's do this one last time   hands up   we're higher than a mother... 
   higher than a mother... 
 jump in my hoopty hoopty hoop   I own that   and I ain't paying my rent this month   I owe that   but... who you want 
and... who you like  
 dance your life, there's no end in sight   twinkle, twinkle, little star   now, everybody, let me hear you say   starships were meant to fly   hands up and touch the sky   starships were meant to fly   hands up, and touch the sky   let's do this one more time   oh oh oh  One, two. 
Han, did you just go up on your tiptoes like a big boy? 
Well, I wasn't expecting a photo opportunity. 
And I left my tom cruise man-heels at home. 
Max, give him a break. 
This is a man who was too short to be a jockey. 
Oleg, give me your camera. 
I must approve picture. 
We've taken it three times already. 
Han, if you want a nip slip, just ask. 
My dress is too pretty for this conversation, so I'm gonna go get the cupcake from the refrigerator. 
And I'm going to warm up my new town car for the ladies. 
New? 
What is this, 2002? 
I hope so, then I will have chance to meet you for first time all over again. 
Now this is not professional driver talk. 
Hey, fancy ball Buster, what's your deal? 
You told him to get a dream and a drive, and he did. 
Max, I have two sore spots. 
Trusting men and... 
And here, where that crazy Jamaican wove my extensions too tight. 
I'm thinking I should wait to put the cupcake in the cupcake purse till we get out of the car. 
We want our beer batter maple bacon cupcake to represent our cupcake business. 
We have a new record. 
She cupcake four times in one speech. 
We should go. 
Upper East Side from Brooklyn at this time of day is crazy. 
But we came in here to show Earl. 
Maybe Earl decided not to come since he had the night off. 
Max, we really should be there at the start. 
That's prime Martha Stewart stalking time. 
You're right. 
And Martha will probably have to leave early to get up to bake; A little something I knows about. 
The only difference between Martha and I is she probably doesn't have to worry about waking up her roommate who lives four feet from the oven. 
But otherwise, twinsies! 
Hold up, hold up, hold up. 
Earl, slow down, your heart. 
Sorry I'm late, ladies. 
But if I run any faster, the cops tend to pull guns on me. 
Got held up at the florist shop, but I made it. 
Here you go, ladies. 
Aww, Earl, you got us flowers? 
Wrist corsages. 
I hope they're still in style. 
They're a classic, Earl. 
Like you. 
Mmm, that was worth the run. 
Let's go, ladies. 
Oleg is waiting to drive you. 
And you drive me crazy. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Tell it to the marines. 
Here, Earl, take my phone. 
I can't fit it in the purse with my cupcake. 
Have the best time in the world. 
And say hello to "huge" Jackman for me. 
That is not a good sign. 
That car is smoking harder than Bob Marley on a rasta holiday. 
Sophie, if my cousin Yuri said he would be here in half hour with parts to fix, he will be here in half hour. 
Actually, it's been 40 minutes. 
Your cousin is like you. 
 He takes too long to come. 
 Oh, this is news. 
Suddenly a woman wants a man to finish fast. 
Oh, please. 
Sex is not a carnival cruise. 
I'm a busy woman. 
You get on, you get off. 
Can I get a hit off that? 
We'll just have to wait, I guess. 
I mean, if I still lived in Manhattan, I'd hail a cab. 
But that's not gonna happen out here in the boondocks! 
Plus, even if we could afford a cab, we'd be stuck forever in rush hour gridlock. 
Could you take it down a notch? 
Hipsters are starting to look at us like we're trying too hard. 
Where did han go? 
He said he might have a plan. 
Oh, my lord and Taylor! 
That little mother can ride. 
You two look like two princesses in a fairy tale. 
Are you feeling safe? 
I couldn't feel any safer if we were riding a rubber into town. 
Here we go. 
Bye, guys. 
 Bye. 
 Go, Chestnut! 
Oh, check it out. 
You see what I see? 
Hello, officers. 
We're on way to the ball down the street, and we were wondering if we could please leave our horse with your horses? 
And I can save you the time on the breathalyzer test; No, we are not drunk or on some bachelorette party scavenger hunt. 
Our car broke down in Brooklyn, so we rode over the Brooklyn bridge and up. 
You rode a horse across the Brooklyn bridge? 
That's badass. 
Yes... 
And illegal. 
In that case, we took the tunnel. 
Well, I think we can help you two ladies. 
Not gonna happen, Dave. 
We're on duty. 
Officers, we're already a little late. 
And with all due respect, we don't have time to play good cop, bad cop. 
Or in your cases, hot cop, hot cop. 
Well, I think we can help you ladies. 
Let's get you down off of there. 
I got the one in the low-cut. 
Thanks officer hot and officer hotter. 
You know I'm officer hotter, right? 
Oh, come on, man. 
Have you seen me in my sunglasses? 
No contest. 
Max, I'm really impressed with how well you're maneuvering around in that long skirt. 
Yeah, I was a serving wench at a medieval times restaurant. 
It's a breeze when I'm not carrying a tray loaded with Turkey legs and ale. 
There's the "will call" table. 
Walk in front and I'll hide behind you, as I'm the most hated woman in New York. 
So basically, I'm a human shield? 
Well, you have more up here to stop anything. 
 Max! 
 What? 
Did someone pull a gun? 
I knew that was gonna happen. 
No, I screamed because I saw the couple whose sworn statement put my father in prison. 
Max! 
Acid in your pretty face? 
Sorry, I stayed up all night reading what people want to do to you in your hate mail. 
What was it? 
I went down so fast, I may have smeared my cupcake. 
That's the filthiest sounding clean thing I ever heard. 
It's fine. Good. 
Now let's go get those cheap plastic security bracelets that ruin our expensive gowns. 
 Can I get your name? 
 Caroline... 
Channing. 
I'm sorry, what? 
Caroline... 
Channing. 
What's with you? 
Just say your name. 
Channing. 
Did you say channing? 
Caroline channing? 
Wait, are you that Caroline channing? 
Shh, yes, and I personally called the R.S.V.P. number. 
It has to be there. 
Channing, channing, channing... 
No, I don't see "Caroline channing." 
Shh. 
Maybe it's under my name. 
Max black. 
I'm with her. 
Black... no, no, no, 
I don't see any blacks here. 
You mean besides the ones working security? 
Let me check with Paul Platt, the party planner. 
He's on the phone with him right now. 
Hey, Brody. 
Both: Oh, no. 
There's a problem with the list. 
She's not on it. 
Her. 
 Caroline channing. 
 Sh Paul, I've got Caroline channing, and she's not on the list. 
If everybody in this line could just wait until we get the Caroline channing situation under control... 
If you say "channing" one more time, I'm going to actually pull your voice box out. 
And its s so much more violent than it sounds. 
Yes, Paul, I'll tell them. 
There's been a little mix-up. 
Five more minutes will get you right in. 
You're not getting in. 
Well, that's it. 
We tried. 
 We gave it our best shot. 
 Oh, no. 
This is the closest I have ever gotten to anything in my life almost working out. 
 We are not giving up. 
 How are we getting in? 
 Security's everywhere. 
 Yeah, out here, but not at the servers' entrance. 
I catered this last year. 
That's right, we're going backdoor. 
Ooh! 
That lady just punched me. 
I knew that was gonna happen! 
So you can just walk in here? 
Anyone can just walk right in? 
Well, it helps that last year I made out with the tent flap guard, Rico, but basically, yeah, anyone. 
When I think of all the times I left my purse on a table here unattended, I shudder... 
Shudder. 
Okay, so we can't get in the actual building without being caterers, so we have to change into those uniforms. 
Wait. 
You never mentioned anything about a rent-a-clothes situation. 
Small price to pay for us making it. 
Is it? Is it 
a small price to pay? 
Hurry, we have a superstar to stalk! 
I thought I would hate it, but I'm kind of into it. 
I'm very Janelle Monae. 
No, you're Janelle I-have-no-Monae. 
What are we going to do with our dresses? 
We can't leave them out here. 
I need them inside. 
I have to look amazing when I meet Martha Stewart. 
What does it matter what we're wearing? 
We're still going to be the two crazy girls chasing her down with a cupcake. 
 That's why it matters. 
 Oh, ooh! 
I know. 
Here. 
Help me get the shelves out of this. 
We can hang our dresses in here and push them in. 
Brilliant. 
Kind of like the Louis Vuitton travel wardrobe I used to have. 
Or the service elevator I was born in. 
Coming through, hot food. 
Look out, very hot! 
Man, it's hot. 
You're a waiter, not a weatherman. 
Hey, pretty girls, I like the way you push around that big steel box why don't you come over here and I'll have sex with you? 
A display like that really makes you appreciate oleg's nuanced wit. 
Okay, let's go right to the ladies room so we can change. 
Is it that way or that way? 
What? 
Shh, Johnny! 
How'd he get invited? 
This used to be an exclusive event. 
He's "made it," he goes where "made it" people go. 
Why are we hiding from that lowlife? 
If he sees me in another waiter uniform, I'm the sad girl always in the uniform. 
If he sees me in that dress at the ball, he can suck it. 
Ladies room, that way. 
The ladies room is right down here. 
Push harder. Harder! 
Do you want Martha to see you dressed like that? 
 Move! Coming through! 
 Excuse us. 
Food emergency. 
Fingers, fingers, fingers, fingers. 
Coming through, coming through. 
 Excuse us. 
 Look alive, red! 
 I almost hit you. 
 Hold up. 
Now just hold up. 
What is going on right now? 
You can't bring food in here. 
Oh, it's not food. 
That would be weird. 
It's dresses. 
We have to change into these, 'cause she has this guy she wants to impress, and I have to change into it because I'm stalking Martha Stewart. 
Ooh, I'd be a terrible spy. 
Usually I don't get the long stories till the end of the night, and by then, the girls are crying and begging me for Wisdom and tic tacs. 
I'll go first. 
I have to get two of these in one dress. 
Miss, do you have a shoehorn? 
Come on, chanel shoes! 
Come on, chanel knockoffs. 
Why are you not dressed yet? 
'Cause ladies take forever. 
It's all the spanx. 
Well, go, use my stall. 
I want to go stick my head out, and see if I can scope out Johnny. 
No, ma'am, no! 
Not fair, ma'am. 
Try the handicapper. 
This side. 
Good idea. 
I cannot get a break tonight. 
 Psst, yo, Max. 
 Johnny! 
Who are you looking for? 
The Dominos guy. 
I was hiding in there, 'cause five more minutes, the pizza's free. 
I was hoping I'd run into you. 
Eh, no big deal. 
Pretty big deal. 
You look amazing. 
Amazing. I will go 
as far as amaze-balls. 
Thanks. 
You look like a guy in a commercial who has a ring and puppy hidden somewhere. 
Can you believe it? 
We're both at this shmancy thing. 
Look how far we've gotten. 
Actually, when you think about it, we didn't get very far at all. 
Nope, you're right. 
We didn't. 
Yeah, why? 
Timing, I guess. 
Timing? 
Okay, whatever. 
You know, from now on, when I think of you, I'm gonna think of you in this and not the uniform. 
You know, from now on, maybe you shouldn't think of me at all. 
Gotta go, Mr. Manhattan. 
That was awesome! 
Caroline, where are you? 
I'm almost dressed. 
I just had the perfect in-your-face good-bye with Johnny. 
And speaking of "in your face," he couldn't take his eyes off my boobs... 
Boobs that he can never have, now that he's getting married. 
Damn, girl, you look good. 
What you doing later? 
Can I get your number? 
Oh, no, the cupcake got a little smushed in my purse. 
We can't show this to Martha Stewart now. 
Sure, we can. 
You think she never had a cupcake smush on her? 
I doubt that very much. 
Martha Stewart is perfect. 
Her feet don't even touch the ground. 
The woman probably doesn't even go to the bathroom. 
Martha Stewart's hardly perfect. 
And how are you this evening? 
No, you're right, Martha Stewart isn't perfect. 
Oh, I never said that! 
In fact, I hear she's a real ballbuster. 
You did not hear that. 
Yep, a real ballbuster, you know? 
No, I do not know. 
Would you mind handing me a towelette please? 
Oh, one's fine. 
Thank you so much. 
But the fact that Martha Stewart is so tough... 
Caroline, you need to get out here right now. 
The fact that she is a real ballbuster... 
Oh, dear God, help me. 
Is what I like and respect about her. 
I mean, the woman's a genius. 
Now it's getting interesting. 
And besides, you can't really believe gossip. 
Look at all that hate mail I got with people calling me a bitch, and I'm not a bitch. 
Well, that's debatable. 
 Martha Stewart, hi. 
 Hello. 
I'm Caroline, and this is my business partner, Max, and we have a start-up cupcake business. 
Dude, are you serious? 
You're still going for it. 
I know this is highly inappropriate, but we brought a cupcake here tonight in hopes that you might taste it. 
So you want me to taste your cupcake in the ladies room. 
What's inappropriate about that? 
We're a start-up business. 
We've got to take risks. 
This is Max. 
She's the baker. 
You're the baker. 
I'm the baker. 
Hm, it looks quite appealing. 
Oh, my God. 
I know this is a social event, so I'm so sorry for making it about business. 
When you're in business for yourself, you have to take every situation as a business opportunity. 
Look, I have five of these in here. 
I love your magazine. 
I read every single issue until they realized I didn't even go to that doctor. 
Well, in spite of the fact that you have not yet washed your hands... 
I was just changing my dress in there. 
 I'll taste it. 
 You will? 
I like your entrepreneurial drive. 
And I have a feeling that it's actually the only way I'm gonna get out of here alive. 
That is our beer batter maple bacon spring break cupcake. 
 Hm, clever name. 
 Thank you. 
It is a little smushed, though. That's unfortunate. 
I told you. 
Mmm. 
Quiet tasty. 
I like it. 
Do you girls have a card? 
Get it out, get it out, get it out. 
Ah, thank you very much. 
"Max's homemade cupcakes." 
Well, you know who'd really like that cupcake? 
Stoners. 
She said "Max's homemade cupcakes." 
Both: Martha Stewart likes our cupcakes! 
Martha Stewart likes our cupcakes! 
 Pick up. 
Table ten, table 12, table 69. 
 Oleg, there is no table 69. 
 There could be. 
 Oleg just sixtynined me, and now I don't remember any of the table numbers. 
 Look, he's never gonna stop sixty-nining us. 
Forget the table numbers. 
Here's how you remember your orders. 
You just give people nicknames. 
Look, I got thin cee lo, fat rihanna, jon beret ramsey, and kristen bad wig. 
 Oh, okay. 
I got seth rogaine, child molester moustache, and lesbian justin bieber. 
 Good. 
 Thanks. 
 Pick up. 
Table six. 
...ty-nine. 
+  So can I get you anything else? 
Coffee? Dessert? 
Morning-after pill? 
Okay. 
 Getting it on in a restaurant. 
I once made love to a young angela lansbury in a booth just like that. 
Murder she wrote? 
more like "harder she begged." 
 Earl, why isn't everyone you? 
 Yo, what's up, mama? 
 Oh, hey, johnny. 
Usual? 
Two coffees to go? 
 Yeah, and can I get two of your cupcakes? 
 Which two? 
 You know which two. 
 The discounted dayolds? 
 Yeah, girl. 
 Hey, my bro and friend. 
 Hey, what's up, big guy? 
 Max, your boyfriend is here. 
 He's not my boyfriend. 
He's just another guy who likes my cupcakes. 
'cause who doesn't? 
 Well, your face gets red when you see him, and you suddenly act like nice person. 
If that's not love, I don't know what is. 
 He doesn't know what love is. 
The only thing he ever loved was a stepladder. 
Johnny, here's your stale cake and burnt coffee. 
 Just how I like it. 
What do I owe you? 
 It's on me. 
You wish it was on you. 
 There's nothing going on. 
He just comes in here to get coffee because he tags billboards all night. 
 Methinks the lady doth protest too much. 
 Listen, renaissance fair, why don't you be a good wench and clean up your counter? 
 Until the cupcake business takes off, i'm just gonna have to find a temp job online. 
Can I close this window that says "mexican painkillers"? 
 Yeah, yeah, but, uh, bookmark it first. 
 Here we are. 
Craigslist. Okay. 
How does this job sound? 
 Disgusting and depraved. 
 You didn't even hear it yet. 
 Did I not hear "craigslist"? 
 Oh. Here's something 
easy I could do. 
A professional organizer. 
 You're not a professional organizer. 
You're barely a professional waitress. 
 I am a genius at organizing things and getting them out of the way. 
I recently lost all my money and the promise of a bright future, and I've organized that into a file in my head labeled "do not open until you are stronger." 
If I can handle that for myself, I can certainly handle a stranger's light filing. 
 If I had known all that craziness was going on in your head, I would have ordered you some mexican pain killers. 
Or the peruvian. 
They're stronger, but sometimes they make you lose control of your hands. 
Thought that was an ibuprofen. 
 What is johnny doing here at 3:00 a. M.? 
Thought it was a rapist or something. 
 Rapists don't knock and wave. 
And if they looked like that, we wouldn't call them rapists. 
We'd call them... 
Johnny! 
What are you doing here? 
 I'm here to talk to you guys about the church of latter day saints. 
And I have to pee. 
Can I use your bathroom? 
 No problem. Don't forget 
to tip the bathroom attendant. 
 What's up, caroline? 
 Just trying to find a day job where I won't get handcuffed to a radiator. 
 On craigslist? 
 This is so romantic. 
Jumping over the back wall to drop down and see you in the middle of the night? 
It's very romeo and juliet. 
 it is very romeo and juliet. 
He has to pee, and I'm the nearest toilet. 
 Please. 
That's just an excuse. 
The man defaces buildings. 
And what? 
He draws the line at peeing on them? 
He came by here to see you. 
Pull your hair back. 
It's kind of in your face. 
 Pull yourself back. 
You're kind of in my face. 
Thanks, guys. 
I was tagging a building nearby, and while I was on the roof I saw that your light was on, so I thought I'd stop in and say hey. 
 Hey. 
 So, johnny, you just saw our light on from the roof nearby? 
Interesting. 
Do you always look down when you're up that high? 
 Not really. 
 Interesting. 
 Flying solo tonight. 
My lookout guy went into rehab. 
It's kind of a pain. 
It's really a two-person operation. 
 Ugh, such a bummer when people can't handle their heroin. 
 Hey, max, what are you doing tomorrow night after work? 
Any desire to be my lookout guy? 
 I might have some desire to be your lookout guy, but as far as the "guy" part of "lookout guy" goes, full disclosure  What, you don't have a penis? 
 Oh, I have one. 
In a drawer in my bedroom. 
If the cops come tomorrow, I will run like a girl. 
 Okay. So pick you up 
at the diner at 2:00? 
 Cool. 
 Cool. 
 Cool. 
And then romeo left. 
So romantic. All the weeks 
of flirting and game playing have finally led to this You two on a late-night roof rendezvous. 
 Hey, genius organizer, why don't you put all that garbage in a file labeled "I've seen too many katherine heigl movies"? 
 I'm just saying, he likes you. 
He likes you with his penis. 
 There. 3f. 
All right. 
You're here. 
Goodbye. 
Go organize. 
 No, I said you have to wait until I open the door and check out if it's safe. 
 It's my day off. 
You're the one with the job. 
 And you're the one who freaked me out so much about going into a stranger's apartment. 
 What did I say that was so bad? 
 You told me he'd cut off my face and wear it as a party hat. 
 I said... 
"probably." 
Probably cut off your face. 
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you, okay? 
 Okay. 
It's a safe-enough looking building, right? 
 Yes. 
Look, they have those hallway trash chutes. 
That's probably how he'll get rid of your faceless body! 
 You're right. 
I'm fine. Go. 
 Caroline's second job. 
So proud. 
Call me if you freak out or anything. 
 How am I gonna call you without a face? 
I'm fine. 
I'm not gonna call you. 
Hello, it's caroline, the professional organizer. 
Hello? Someone called 
for an organizer? 
Hello? 
Oh, no. 
Oh, hell no. 
Max, come back! 
+  Hurry up. 
This is so exciting! 
 What are you talking about? 
I'm not going back in there. 
He's a hoarder. 
A hoarder. 
It's a bad reality show. 
 Hey, that is a great reality show. 
 but it's not good reality reality. 
 The only thing I love more than hoarders are people who are too fat to fit through doors. 
Tell me the hoarder has to grease his sides to get through the door. 
You won't have to get me a birthday present. 
Are you kidding me? 
They should charge admission for this. 
It's hoarders 3d The experience. 
It's like going to an imax. 
It's my max! 
ooh! 
Save yourself. 
Go on without me. 
Oh, god. 
 What is that pile over there? 
 It's hard to tell what is what. 
It's either a An old shag carpet or a mass grave of dead muppets. 
 No way. 
Let's get out of here. 
 We still have our faces. 
Why would we leave? 
And besides, you need this money. 
Look around. 
There might be stuff here they don't want that we can sell on ebay. 
Look. You know someone's 
gonna want a fish tank full of doll heads. 
 Yeah, someone with a fish tank full of doll bodies. 
Last year I owned a yacht named the caroliner, and now I'm considering selling doll heads on ebay. 
I'll be organizing that thought in a file in my head labeled "don't open ever." 
 Okay. 
There's a heavy clown presence in this room. 
It's unsettling, and I'm obsessed with it. 
I want both more and less of the clowns. 
 Um, hello? 
Anyone here? 
 Oh, hey, i'm over here. 
 I'm sorry. 
Where? 
 By the papers. 
 Which papers? 
 The papers near the papers. 
 Oh, my god. 
I love this! 
 Um, hi. Caroline? 
We spoke yesterday. 
There's a lot more to organize here than you led me to believe on the phone, so we're gonna have to renegotiate our price. 
 It's not that bad. 
 Not that bad? 
I was hired to organized some papers, not clean up katrina. 
 What's he look like? 
Please tell me he needs to be buried in a piano box. 
 I don't know. I can't see 
him through the truck. 
 It's an rv, and it's a collectible. 
It's where I keep my raisins. 
So how much more, then? 
 Um, a hundred a day. 
For both of us. 
 And we get to keep the horse head made out of soda cans. 
 Why would we want that? 
 We don't. 
It's for chestnut. 
Every horse wants a friend made out of cans. 
 You got a deal. 
 Okay. 
We'll get to work then. 
Okay. 
Let's not get overwhelmed. 
We'll take it one step at a time. 
Let's start small. 
Happy birthday to me. 
 Whoo, max. 
Well, look at you. 
Starting the night at the end of the night. 
This is the first time I've seen you out of the prison uniform. 
You look beautiful. 
 Oh, earl, let's get married. 
What are you staring at? 
It's just clothes. 
 Max, you look like a lady. 
Tonight when I dream of having sex with you, as always, this time I will ask you to stay. 
 Max, you look perfect for your date. 
 It's not a date. 
 It is. 
 No, it's not. 
It's booty call. 
 There is a fresh, white billboard. 
I'm climbing it with my friend, and we're putting up his artwork. 
 Booty call on billboard. 
If it's after 2:30, call is for the dirty. 
 What's that from? 
Dr. Seuss' "oh, the places 
you'll put it in"? 
Okay, boys, break it up. 
Go about your business. 
Nothing to see. 
 Max. 
Max and johnny's first date. 
So proud. 
 It's not a date. 
 Be home at 11:00... 
a.m. 
 Uh, max, you got protection? 
 No, I've got it. 
 Me too. 
 Oh, sorry. 
That is pack of gum. 
 Can we take these masks off now? 
 Whoo. It is hot 
up in that bunny. 
 Are we wearing these so no one'll be able to pick us out of a lineup? 
 Yeah, that. 
And I always wanted to see a rat with big boobs. 
 Well, here he is. 
 All right. Now for the most 
crucial part of the art process, beer break. 
 That makes sense. 
Been here four minutes. 
 Hmm. 
 Ooh. Gentleman. 
 Look over there. 
You can see manhattan. 
 Oh, yeah. 
She's a bitch. 
Always shoving her stuff in your face. 
You can never have it. 
 Yeah. 
I'd never want to live in manhattan. 
 'Cause you can't afford it? 
 Yeah. 
 She is beautiful, though. 
 Yeah, she is. 
Well, we should get back to work. 
Bunny's gotta hop. 
+  How many more times do you need to hear it? 
He didn't kiss me. 
 Maybe it wasn't the right time. 
 Overlooking the new york skyline, a hundred feet in the air, bathed in moonlight? 
Yeah, that's a crappy time. 
 Maybe he didn't want to make a move because he doesn't know you like him. 
 I leaned in. 
I leaned for a kiss. 
Maybe you had a breath situation. 
What did you eat? 
What had you eaten? 
 Nothing. 
 Okay, but sometimes when you don't eat, it's worse, because you start to grind up your feelings. 
Then you get stomach breath. 
I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling with stomach breath. 
 Yes, you would. 
 Yes, I would. 
I'm finally making progress on the papers. 
Oh, no, fdr died of polio. 
Oh, look. 
They cured polio. 
 Jackpot. This place 
is a freakin' cat factory. 
 And they're alive. 
How refreshing. 
 There's, like, 45 kittens in this box, and I think one of these kittens just had kittens. 
Kittens having kittens. 
 Hey, douglas, we found some kittens. 
 Those are not my kittens. 
 Okay. What about this mountain 
of butterfinger wrappers? 
 those are my wrappers. 
I need those. 
 I haven't even seen him yet. 
I love this show. 
 Douglas, if you're comfortable with me selling all this sort-of-valuable stuff on ebay, why do you need to keep a box full of butterfinger wrappers? 
 I don't want to think about it! 
See, max? 
This is what happens when you don't deal with your feelings. 
You start collecting butterfinger wrappers, and next thing you know you're an old lady in a rest home, and you're thinking "why didn't he kiss me?" 
 why didn't he kiss me? 
 I don't know. 
Why didn't you kiss him? 
You obviously like him, right? 
Max, stop hoarding your feelings. 
Just admit that you like him. 
 I like him. 
 Okay, good. 
There's one box of butterfinger wrappers gone. 
 What? 
 Douglas, it's a metaphor. 
So next time you see him, why don't you just kiss him? 
 I don't know if I can kiss him first. 
 Just kiss him already! 
 Wait, there's another person in here? 
 Butt out, ma. 
 Those are my kittens, young lady. 
 Hold up. He's hoarding 
another hoarder in here? 
Awesome. 
I can't believe you put the platypus foot rest in the trash. 
On ebay we could get at least three to six dollars for it. 
 I'm gonna tell you this one more time. 
It's a opossum, and it died at least three to six years ago. 
Oh, my god. 
There's johnny. 
 This is a katherine heigl movie. 
 What are you guys doing in this neighborhood? 
 Oh, hello. 
Sorry to interrupt you, but what the hell's going on here? 
 This is, uh... 
 I'm cassandra, his girlfriend. 
Who are you? 
 I'm max, and, um, that's how I say hi to everyone. 
I'm incredibly friendly. 
 She's so friendly. 
 Here's table ten, earl. 
 Are you okay, max? 
Rumor has it that you had your heart broken. 
 I didn't have my heart broken. 
 And that's why I don't listen to rumors. 
 Max, I want to announce I have ended my bromance with your boyfriend, johnny. 
I hate the player as well as the game. 
 Never was my boyfriend. 
 I would like to offer myself for rebound sex. 
Or, if not, I can just beat the crap out of him. 
 Caroline, did you have to tell everyone? 
 I'm sorry, but I'm not keeping that up in my head. 
I'm not going butterfingers. 
I can't believe he has a girlfriend. 
 Are you happy now? 
You got me to admit that I like him, and then you got me to kiss him. 
And then I kissed his beautiful girlfriend, who is black and british, the two cool things I can never be. 
 I'm sorry, but he led you on. 
 Oh, did he? 
I think you and douglas' mother led me on. 
This is not my fault. 
He's the one who's hoarding women. 
 Hi. 
 Yeah, you must be to come back in here. 
 Can we talk? 
Pick up, max. 
Table three, table nine. 
Table 69. 
Not a good time. 
 Max, look... 
 Johnny, stop. 
You don't need to "max, look" me. 
It's cool. 
You never led me on. 
You never put your hands on me. 
You never even kissed me. 
Food! 
Hey, better make sure he doesn't have a girlfriend who's beautiful, black, and british. 
 Max, look, I wanted to kiss you. 
I want to kiss you. 
I just didn't want to be the guy who did it when he's with someone else. 
Look, max, I didn't know you were gonna come into my life. 
I didn't know I was gonna have these feelings for you, but all of a sudden it's "max" all the time in my head. 
Cassandra and I have or-or had something, and there is or was love there, and-and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with all my feelings for you. 
 Johnny, I just spent two days wading through someone else's garbage, and, quite frankly, I don't have the time or the energy to go through all the clowns and candy wrappers you've got going on up in there. 
And the next time you invite someone to a booty call on a billboard... 
 It wasn't a booty call. 
 I think everyone knows if it's after 2:30, the call is for the dirty. 
And p.s., we've known 
each other six months, and you never told me you had a girlfriend. 
You should have worn the rat mask. 
 And that's all she wrote. 
 Silver lining time? 
 We didn't have to change douglas and his mother's diapers? 
 We made $240 for the cupcake business selling all that crap on ebay. 
 Yup. I made some money, 
and all I lost was my mind. 
 Want to hear something you don't want to hear? 
I think what johnny said to you was beautiful. 
 You think a squirrel holding an acorn is beautiful. 
 He didn't touch you or kiss you because he didn't want to start a relationship with you out of a lie. 
 You know what? 
You're right. 
You've been right all along. 
It is like romeo and juliet. 
And now I'm gonna go home and kill myself. 
I don't think romance is in the cards for me. 
I give guys blue balls, not broken hearts. 
 Oh, my god. 
Don't kill yourself yet, juliet. 
I definitely think romance is in your cards. 
 That's not me. 
 That's not his girlfriend. 
Come on, will you at least admit that that's you and that he put it up there because he wanted you to see it? 
And that's actually incredibly romantic. 
 Oh, yeah. 
That's the most romantic picture of a guy who might be kissing someone who might look like me, but he didn't because he has a hot british girlfriend who seems like kind of a bitch, but is kind of cooler than I will ever be. 
I dare you to organize that thought. 
 There's no one cooler than you. 
You're 200 feet tall. 
 Yeah, and a bird just took a crap on me. 
 Come on. 
Come on. 
﻿1 Max.

It's the woman at table 2's 50th birthday and her husband wants us to sing to her. 
If I had a dollar every time a man asked me to do something to his wife, I'd be a millionaire. 
I remember when Happy Birthday first came up. 
I never thought it would catch on. 
Go! 
And smile. 
When you fake smile, everybody else fakes smile back. 
Nobody wants to hear that lame song. 
If we want to humiliate her in public, why don't we go over there and pull her top down? 
Come on, let's just go sing and make the best of it. 
Ready? 
One, two, three... 
 Happy birthday to you... 
Whoa! 
I apologize. 
It's hard enough your husband took you to a diner on your birthday and now you have to listen to white Mariah? 
No! 
Happy ***. 
 To yoooooooou  visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com 
I have announcement to make. 
I agree with what Max said before. 
What? That we should tie 
a little bell around you, so we know when you're near? 
The diner needs a fresh, new way to celebrate the customer birthday. 
So I just went and wrote a special song. 
Han, I'd be happy to look at what you've written so far. 
I took music theory in college. 
I once wrote an entire original musical based on the French revolution. 
Um, sorry to step on your nerd turf, but Les Mis is already a musical about the French revolution. 
Yes, but mine was from the point of view of the rich. 
What are you going to rewrite next the musical rent from the point of view of the landlord? 
Han, this is a lovely start, but A lovely start? 
No, I mean, it's good. 
But not good enough. 
I know what you are saying. 
"You need to practice more, Han. 
"You never will be as good as your sister, Han. 
"Whole family going on vacation without you while you practice, Han." 
Back off, tiger mom! 
Hey, Caroline, is Max around? 
Um, she might be. 
I'll go check. 
You'll never guess who just came into the restaurant. 
You'll be very happy. 
Gary, the fat guy from teen mom? 
Someone you like, someone you want to kiss, someone you're hot for. 
Tyler, the skinny guy from teen mom? 
What's Johnny doing here? 
I told him not to show his face unless Unless he broke up with his girlfriend. 
And now he's here, showing his face,  which means  You can't know that for sure. 
Fine. Tell me one other reason 
he could possibly be in here. 
He needs Han to solve a complex math problem? 
Max! 
Max, it's pretty obvious that he's in here because he broke up with his girlfriend "Cassandra" I mean, what else could it be? 
When I had millions of dollars, I had no idea why guys were coming to see me. 
"Do they want me, or do they want my money?" 
But you have nothing! 
So basically that just leaves you. 
Way to puff me up before I go through that door. 
This is so exciting. 
Will you stop? 
Don't be such a girl. 
Hair? Teeth? Anything? 
You're good. 
Wait. 
More. 
 Really? 
 Trust me. 
Oh, uh, hey, Johnny. 
When did you get here? 
Uh, just now. 
I, uh--I came here because I want to tell you something. 
Yes? 
Max, I think you and I have something special. 
And I don't want to lose that. 
So I came down here to ask... 
Even though it didn't work out, can we still be friends? 
 Oh. 
 What? 
You have got to be kidding! 
Oh. 
What's going on over there, Caroline? 
My friend Johnny and I have no idea what you're upset about. 
I was just reacting to the news that we're out of pie. 
I really cannot believe it. 
I totally thought it would go a different way. 
Caroline... 
Why don't you go over there to the pie carrousel and mourn the loss of our pie? 
So, we're cool? 
Yeah, we're cool. 
Why wouldn't we be? 
We never dated or anything like that. 
Of course we're friends. 
I am so relieved. 
So, uh, you gonna go back to busting my balls, like always? 
Yes. 
We're such good friends, I might just... 
Bust them with my feet! 
Good morning. 
I'm trying to send out a get-to-know-us email blast for the cupcake business. 
But your wi-fi is so slow. 
Don't tell me tell cathyhome17, whoever and wherever she is. 
Okay, well, I'm just going to run down to the coffee place and send it. 
Do you approve? 
Nice job. 
The font's pretty. 
You just gave me a compliment? 
I knew it you're depressed. 
You're so depressed about you and Johnny just being friends, you don't even have the energy to be you. 
What? 
The font is pretty. 
Oh, honey, do you want a hug? 
 I'm fine. 
 How could you be fine? 
The man was so into you, he painted a billboard of the two of you kissing. 
And now he just wants to be friends? 
Please call in sick to your babysitting job and take to the bed. 
Whenever I used to get depressed, I'd take to the bed. 
One time, I took to the bed for a week. 
Listen, unlike you, Jane Austen, I will never take to the bed. 
Giving into feelings is for rich people. 
Regular people just have to get up, get drunk, and go fulfill their babysitting duties. 
Max, take to the bed. 
Look, this is my pattern, okay? 
I fall for the wrong guy, I find out they're with a girl, a bottle, or a needle, and I move on. 
And sometimes I use a bottle to help me do it... 
Or a needle or a girl. 
But when I'm done, I'm done. 
That's it? 
You're just over it? 
Wow. 
I'm still sad because Kyle Enright didn't invite me on his private jet to Mykonos for his 12th birthday. 
Well, not me. 
Just flip a switch and those feelings are gone. 
I only have two switches in my life one turns off my emotions, the other makes a car bounce. 
Okay, I better go. 
If you get there after 10:30, you can't hear yourself think over the sounds of people skyping to the Philippines. 
Max, are you sure you're all right? 
Max. 
Are you about to come over here and soft-touch me? 
 I want to so bad. 
 Leave! 
Go to the coffee place. 
Soft-touch the barista. 
Excuse me, miss. 
You keep your door open like that, this rat's probably going to get inside. 
Don't worry. You should see 
the size of my cat. 
What are you doing here? 
I knew you'd be home for another hour, so I brought you coffee. 
And I wanted to say... 
Thanks for understanding the situation. 
Hey, you don't need to get all "hallmark presents: Johnny soft eyes" on me. 
Okay? 
You're not my type, anyway. 
You're a bartender who's close to liquor all night and your not an alcoholic. 
So clearly you don't know how to seize an opportunity. 
Yes, I do. 
+ This is where you join in birthday song with your sweet-ass saxophone. 
Han, I like you, brother, but I played with everyone from Marvin Gaye to the gay Marvins. 
They never made it--a little bit ahead of their time. 
But if you don't mind a professional opinion, man, you've got to put some heart into this thing. 
But my mother always say to run away from heart only the head can make music. 
Han, your mother sounds like one cold Don't you talk about my mama! 
Hey, Earl. 
What's up? 
I just got threatened by a man who gets carded at Pixar movies. 
Max, great news that email blast I sent out this morning worked. 
I just got us a big cupcake job at some event place called the gold space loft. 
Last time I was at the gold space loft, I went to a poetry slam, and I wound up slamming a poet. 
They need 100 cupcakes by tomorrow night. 
And because I'm a genius, and also because it's such short notice but mostly because I'm a genius I got them up to $500. 
It's a cool group art show very Williamsburg, very pot brownie. 
And Johnny has a piece in it. 
And since you flipped your switch, I figured it'd be fine. 
No way. I can't make 
100 cupcakes in a day. 
Max, I know it's a lot of work, but I'll do whatever I can to help. 
This is a really big opportunity for us. 
I kissed Johnny. 
What? When? 
He came by the apartment right after you left. 
I was only gone 20 minutes. 
What'd you do--shine a bat symbol on your vagina? 
Stop acting like I wanted it to happen. 
I didn't want it to happen. 
I'm lucky we just kissed. 
My pants kept saying, "take me off!" 
And I'm like, "no, pants." 
I'm telling you, I almost couldn't help myself. 
I don't understand. 
I thought you said you were done with him. 
What happened to your pattern? 
Telling people I have a pattern is part of the pattern. 
Then I just go and do whatever I want. 
I knew it, it thought it, I should have said it girls cannot be friends with guys. 
Yeah, well, you also knew he was coming in here to tell me he broke up with his girlfriend. 
So you can suck it. 
Did he say he was going to break up with her? 
We didn't get into it. 
We weren't really using our mouths for talking. 
What do you think's going to happen? 
I don't know. 
All I know is it's not going to happen at a public art show in front of him and his beautiful, cool British girlfriend. 
Max, you don't even have to see them. 
We'll get there early, we'll drop off the cupcakes, and be gone before any of the artists even show up. 
Great. 
I'm going home tonight after my ten-hour waitress shift, to stay up all night and bake 100 cupcakes for a guy I kissed who has a girlfriend. 
Beep. 
Ooh, what's that? 
My self-esteem just flatlined. 
Yeah, it's this way. 
I smell patchouli and pretension. 
Why are you walking so slow? 
Because I'm carrying our cupcake future, and I don't want half of our future's frosting to be on top of the box. 
Relax. 
We still have time. 
Oh, hello. 
Welcome to space blast art attack. 
The gallery won't be open for, like, an hour. 
Actually, we're here delivering the cupcakes. 
We're looking for someone named Traivor. 
And I'm looking for Traivor's mom, to ask her why she named a person Traivor. 
Traive! 
You girls can set up inside. 
He's the one with the super-tall hat. 
I love galleries. 
My father and I had an art foundation. 
We taught blind kids how to do ceramics. 
Why didn't you just buy them eyes? 
Let's put them here. 
This art show is ridiculous someone named Traivor, a dreamcatcher with buzzwords stuck in it. 
And you. 
Why would he hang that picture of us if he still has a girlfriend? 
Maybe he went home and broke up with her after he kissed you. 
The writing is literally on the wall. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
I'm not falling for you again. 
Let's just get our money and go. 
Oh, uh... 
Grown lady dressed like a doll, we can't find tall hat, and we need to get paid for the cupcakes and leave. 
Leave? 
What are you talking about. 
 You're serving the cupcakes. 
 Pardon? 
Well, why do you think we're paying you $500 for cupcakes? 
Because my friend's a genius. 
This is new information. 
We need to talk to someone. 
Traive! 
Oh, no. Traive is busy 
installing his ice penis. 
I could get someone else on the show committee to help. 
Cashandra! 
What's his girlfriend doing here? 
 Oh, God! 
What if soft eyes wussed out and told her what happened? 
 Does she look mad? 
 No, she looks amazing. 
Max, hello. 
We met that one time on the street. 
Cashandra, Johnny's girlfriend. 
Oh, hi, hi. 
I'm Johnny's friend. 
We're just friends. 
Hi, "Cassandra." 
I'm Caroline. 
I was with Max on the street. 
And all day yesterday. 
We were together every minute. 
It's Cash-andra, actually. 
But everyone calls me Cash. 
And you're Max's business partner, right? 
Yeah, but she makes her own decisions. 
Right. Well, let's just 
get to it, shall we? 
I'm a bleeder. 
It's brilliant it all worked out  with the cupcakes. 
 Excuse me? 
Well, I told Traive to hire you for the show. 
Johnny cannot stop talking about your cupcakes, Max. 
"Max's cupcakes are so moist." 
"Max's cupcakes are delicious." 
He loves your cupcakes. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
But just like in a casual way. 
I mean, he barely even touched them. 
So, um, I'm a bit busy getting ready for the show. 
Why don't you put your little cupcakes on these trays, and when people start coming in, circulate, right? 
Circulate, girls, circulate. 
Well, that wasn't uncomfortable. 
Come on, let's bolt before Johnny gets here, while I at least have a shred of my dignity. 
We can't just bail out of our first big job. 
If we do, people will think we're flakes. 
And that'll spread faster through Williamsburg than knit hats and herpes. 
Hey, you ladies know where the wine goes? 
 Oh  Right here. 
Yeah. 
+ No! Just, uh, not the wine. 
The wine's mine. 
Just serving cupcakes. 
I've been listening in on Cashandra and her girlfriends' conversations, and I don't think she knows anything happened between you two. 
I also learned she's a dancer, her lip gloss is from Kiehl's, and she's school chums with Adele. 
Not the Adele. 
Damn it! 
Could she be any cooler? 
I want her to be my girlfriend. 
I wouldn't break up with her for me. 
Hi. I'm here. 
Great. I was hoping 
tonight would get weirder. 
I had no idea. 
She did it to surprise me. 
And she did I'm surprised. 
I am so sorry. 
You have a girlfriend. 
Why are you kissing Max? 
You told her? 
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. 
Would the more subtle way be to paint a picture and hang it on the wall for all to see? 
Are you insane? 
Could we have a moment, please? 
Fine. 
I'll be over there near the ice penis. 
Look, I am so sorry. 
If I had known Cash was going to ask you to do all of this, I would have told you. 
And why would you choose to hang that? 
'Cause it's my favorite piece. 
Is there any way she could know what happened? 
No. 
 Oh, my God. Your lips. 
 Split up. 
I can smell the sex from across the room. 
No-whoa-whoa! 
I need all those. 
So what? 
Is she still your girlfriend? 
Max, it's complicated. 
What, are we on Facebook? 
It is complicated. 
Cash and I have been together two years,  and when  Two years? 
Jeez, I'm a home wrecker. 
Adele will probably write a song about me. 
You're not a homewrecker. 
 I am. 
 Johnny! 
You've got some folks. 
Circulate, Max, circulate. 
That's it. 
This is over. 
Thatus on the wall never happens again. 
I lied. 
I can't be your friend. 
I was trying to be cool, but I'm not cool. 
I don't know Adele. 
What just happened over there? 
Did he tell you he's breaking up with his girlfriend? 
No. 
What's wrong with you? 
You haven't been right about anything? 
I told him we are done, and that's over, okay? 
They've been together two years. 
And I know one thing about me I may pick the wrong guys, but when I hear another woman is involved, I am done. 
This is truly the end of my pattern. 
We have to go I kissed Johnny again. 
What? 
Max, you said you were going to the bathroom. 
I did. 
And so did he. 
It's a unisex bathroom emphasis on the sex. 
We have to go. 
I'm a little drunk and out of control. 
Traive said we won't get paid until every single one of the cupcakes is gone. 
 So we're stuck here. 
 Fine. 
I shall go circulate. 
No. You cannot be trusted. 
Next thing I know, you'll be doing him behind the ice penis. 
I'm telling you, I am done. 
You told me that five minutes ago. 
Well, you told me he was breaking up with his girlfriend three times. 
So I guess we learned tonight that you know nothing about him, and I know nothing about me. 
Cheers! 
Wait for me. 
Hello, girls. 
Traivor told me you were looking to get paid. 
But just to be clear, you can't actually be paid until all the cupcakes are gone. 
And do me a favor, love, put a chocolate aside for Johnny. 
He loves chocolate. 
He'll eat a vanilla if it's available, but he always goes back to chocolate. 
I don't think he's going to break up with her. 
Really? 
You have the accuracy rate of a magic 8 ball. 
Look at her. 
She's so pretty. 
And bitchy. 
And... 
More pretty than bitchy. 
Oh, God. 
She just zipped his hoodie and fixed his hair that's a couple. 
What they have is real. 
They are a couple Johnny and Cash. 
Oh-ho, crap! 
Johnny Cash! 
They're an institution. 
I never had a chance. 
Forget the money let's just go. 
Mm-mmm. 
We are staying till these cupcakes are gone. 
I am not leaving with no dignity and no money. 
Fine, I'll circulate a couple more times. 
Wait a minute. 
They said they had to be gone, but they didn't say who had to make them gone. 
We eat them and go! 
You're doing it! 
I rescued you from the gutter. 
Uh, well, that's not entirely accura Both:  Mm-hmm! 
Both:  Mmm, mmm. 
    Max, wake up. 
It's 3:00. 
We forgot to set the alarm. 
Oh, I never thought waking up in bed with another woman with...Frosting on my boobs, 
would be this depressing. 
How are you feeling about it all today? 
Do you want to talk? 
 No. 
 Good. 
Where's your purse? 
I'm going to take some of the money we made last night and get coffee. 
And yes I am walking down the street like this, because after last night, I am impenetrable to shame. 
Wait, we don't have any money. 
 Yes, we do. 
 No, we don't. 
We did, but we don't. 
I bought something with it. 
I bought this. 
You carried that home? 
Where was I? 
Three blocks ahead of me, telling strangers about your pattern. 
I saw you and Johnny just hanging there, and I knew what I had to do. 
So what, am I supposed to hang that up? 
No. You're supposed 
to destroy it. 
You need to get over him, so you're going to kick this, and then you're going to kick him once and for all. 
You want to break your pattern? 
Start by breaking the painting. 
That is a complete waste of money. 
I may have been wrong about everything else about Johnny, but I'm right about this. 
Come on. 
Kick it. 
I can't. 
 Give me your foot. 
 What? 
Lift up your leg. 
Yay! You did it. 
Good for you! 
You broke a painting and maybe your pattern. 
I really liked him. 
I know. 
Well? 
I slept through my day job, so what the heck? 
I think I will take to the bed or whatever. 
Just for like 20 minutes. 
I'll set my alarm and then I'll get up and get ready for work. 
Max, please, I feel like we need a hug. 
We just slept together! 
You women are so needy.

﻿1 Evening, hot chocolate. 
Max, we got big trouble from Little China. 
Hi, Max. 
Big trouble? 
There's nothing big about him. He looks 
like a *** in a bear claw machine. 
Max, what is the worst sentence you ever want to come out of Han's mouth? 
I got you pregnant? 
Come on, bad, bad. 
I got you pregnant again? 
I'm putting in karaoke. 
No! No! 
Han... 
Those guys better be up there because we're officially putting ass crack on the menu. 
I am adding a TV to bring in more customers. 
We can have theme nights, Ultimate Fighter nights, Real Housewives of Bravo City nights, and best of all, karaoke night. 
You can't get hispters on microphone. 
That's like throwing fire on a pretentious fire. 
Hipsters like karaoke. 
Replace the word "like" with the word "Hitler" and you got the three worst things in history. 
Max, I hear what you say, but everybody else say "he-ey!" 
All my single ladies! 
Okay. Next person 
is going to sing Teenage Dream by Katy Perry, who is pretty now but used to have very horrible acne. 
This is the third Teenage Dream in 45 minutes. 
Why don't I just close my nuts in the cashier's drawer? 
Come on up now, girl named "Stacey." 
I got this. 
Look, I don't know you, but I like you. 
And I respect both hair choices. 
I hate karaoke. 
I can't afford to have any more hate in my head. 
My hate is at capacity. 
Sit this one out, I'll comp your cobbler. 
What did you do? 
I saved Earl's nuts. 
Pick up! Hot food. Pick up. 
Calm your bells down, Oleg. 
Not my stations. 
Where's Caroline? 
Would it make you jealous if I said she was back here with me? 
Jealous? 
No. 
Pissed? 
Probably, because we're busy and it would take me all that time to get the duct tape off her mouth and hands. 
What are you doin' in here, snow white? 
If you're lookin' for one of your dwarves, he's out there, holding the mic. 
Look, my bite is off. 
See, I did the bite test. 
The number seven incisor is crossing over number nine. 
Hold up. You know 
the names of your teeth? 
Don't you? 
I don't even know the name of my father. 
Ow, I just bit my tongue. 
Ah! Number 12 just joined 
the party. 
I'd stop doing that right now. 
You just made it into Oleg's spank bank. 
Congratulations. 
What am I gonna do without my bite guard? 
My teeth don't know where to go. 
Well, maybe the should just backpack for a couple of years, so they figure it out. 
Listen, perfect teeth, this is a nightmare for me. 
The technical term for this is "advanced bruxism." 
And the technical term for you is "overly dramatic." 
Yesterday you freaked out 'cause we were out of toilet paper. 
Just hold it till you get to work like everybody else. 
Now, maybe I sing while others wait. 
Uh-oh. 
We got real problems now. 
I choose Susan Boyle popular song from all clips on Internet. 
It's called I Dream Keep dreaming. 
Oh, you're back. 
We thought you ran away. 
Chestnut and I were just about to pick out another human from the shelter. 
I had quite a day. 
8:00 to 10:00... 
Grind, grind, pain. 
10:00 to 11:00... 
Pain, pain, grind. 
So I went to the drug store and bought an $8 bite guard, which didn't fit my freaky Tim Burton mouth. 
And when I tried to return it, the cashier, Rhonda, whose nametag said she was happy to help, but who was neither happy nor helpful, said that I couldn't return it because it had already touched my "teef." 
For someone whose jaw is about to unhinge, you're sure flapping it a lot. 
Why is this rag with my father on it here? 
Don't look at me. 
Chestnut bought it. 
He likes it when I read him his daily horse-oscope. 
Why is everybody so obsessed with the fact that he hasn't said anything? 
Haven't you ever been at a loss for words? 
Tampons, yes. 
Words, nah. 
Well, this will make me feel better. 
Whenever I'm in pain, I need a treat. 
You know, whenever you're in pain, that is my treat. 
Sushi! 
I hope you like crab roll. 
I never had sushi. 
That doesn't even make sense. 
No sushi, no dentist... 
Who are you? 
A poor person. 
Sushi's lazy. 
If I come to your restaurant, get up off your ass and cook the damn fish. 
I wish we could afford to go to this little sushi place in Tribeca where my father always took me. 
We had this little joke. 
Every time we'd walk in, I'd always say... 
And we would just laugh! 
So you're not funny in Japanese either. 
I got this at a corner deli. 
The cashier was Japanese. 
She said it was good. 
Oh, I'm sure it's great. 
'Cause the disenfranchised immigrant serving the spoiled white girl would have no reason to lie. 
Get ready for something heavenly! 
That's not heaven. 
 Spit it out. 
 Ugh! 
Ugh! 
What a disappointment. 
Your first time. 
Well, that's kinda the way it goes with me and first times. 
Here, clean yourself off. 
That's exactly the way it goes! 
It's not that bad. 
It's not that bad. 
It's not that bad. 
No. 
For a dentist office in the subway, it's pretty good. 
Seriously, how are you not running out of here? 
I have no choice. 
Now that I have no money or health insurance, I have to get used to this third-world situation. 
Third-world situation? 
This is an underworld situation. 
Okay, there's bulletproof glass. 
With a bullet in it. 
All right, so the glass works. 
It says to sign in. 
Look, why don't you just take some of our cupcake business savings and go to a good dentist office? 
You know, one where you won't get a staph infection just from looking at the floor. 
No, we can't do that. 
That's our future. 
Once we start doing that, it's a slippery slope. 
"Nicole Richie"? 
I don't want anyone to know I was here. 
I know this situation is less than ideal, but I am having a dental emergency. 
No, he's having a dental emergency. 
Come on, let's go over here and see if this man can help me. 
Hi. 
Welcome to Subway Smiles. 
I told ya, we'll get to ya. 
I'm sorry, girls. 
I'm a little shaky. 
I was just shot at. 
I have a problem with my teeth migrating. 
I have advanced bruxism. 
Ah. 
I have hep C. 
Everybody's got their something. 
What do you need? 
We need to be leaving. 
I just need a bite guard. 
Oh! 
I can do that. 
That's where I squirt foam into your mouth and make a mold. 
Come in the back. 
If you go back there with him, you'll need a bite guard and a rape guard. 
You want the gas? 
Is that necessary? 
You're gonna want the gas, sweetheart. 
Let's get outta here. 
One more song before we close. 
I sing Spice Girls' Aww, tell me what you want, what you really, really want. 
That boy's more stiff than Michele Bachmann's husband at a Chippendales. 
I will give you the money for trip to fancy dentist. 
Really? 
Oleg, you would do that? 
It's favor I do for you. 
And at some point, when I come to you for favor, you will say yes, like I say yes now. 
Well, I'd need to know what that favor might be. 
I can't say for sure. 
Will it be in a week or a month? 
I can't say for sure. 
Will it be sexual? 
Yes, it will be. 
This I can say for sure. 
Thank you, but no. 
I am such an idiot. 
I like it. 
Keep going. 
My bite guard is just sitting in the bathroom of my townhouse. 
If I could only get up on the roof, then I could break in through the skylight like I used to when I snuck out in high school. 
Hello, I'm Max. 
Have we met? 
When I was 15, I paid the security system guys extra to not wire the skylight, and then I snuck out and went to Ilana Shapiro's Sweet 16... 
 Cute. 
 In Greece. 
Hardcore. 
I used to sneak out of the house and huff spray paint with an ex-marine. 
And sometimes, I'd just sneak out, look up at the stars, and dream. 
And then you said that. 
See, I told you I can get this *** open. 
Turn on a light! 
Wait till I close the closet door. 
Why are the floors so bouncy? 
It's called "carpet." 
What? 
No way. 
No way. 
Is this Narnia? 
I'm about to say something I swore I'd never say. 
O.M.G. 
Again...O.M.G. 
It's lame, but nothing else really nails it. 
This is the room that O.M.G. 
was born for. 
Max, it's just my closet. 
Your clothes have a house! 
Look, look! 
You are rich! 
Like, I know you've said you were rich, but you are rich. 
You're embarrassing me. 
Are you crazy? 
This is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
What's this do? 
Oh, my God. 
You have a shoe rotisserie. 
I designed it. 
I call it my "Ferris Heels." 
I'd judge you if that wasn't exactly what I'd call it if I had one. 
Okay, we should really go now. 
Lemme just grab my bite guard. 
What? 
You have a museum in your closet? 
Come on, it's just a bathroom. 
Just a bathroom? 
It's the Louvre of pooping. 
Here it is. 
Ow. Ow. Ow. 
Oh, yeah. 
Do you two need to be left alone? 
We have to go. 
Can't risk staying much longer. 
Wow. 
Just when I thought your voice couldn't get any more grating. 
It'll loosen up. 
Oh. 
Seriously, we should go. 
Oh, um, I just have to do one more thing before we go. 
I think me and your tub are going steady. 
Oh, you found the jacuzzi button. 
I don't know who found who, but we're together now. 
I'm totally stealing some of these ridonculous bath soaps. 
This one's shaped like a vagina. 
Seashell. 
Sister, this is a mint green vagina. 
Did you go to the prom with your dad? 
That's my debutante dance, when I came out. 
Out? 
Like you came out that you were dating your dad? 
Gross. 
I think I can still fit a goose feather pillow in. 
Hey, what's this one of you and Chestnut and your dad? 
Oh, that's when my dad bought Chestnut for me. 
It was my first-period present. 
Your dad got you a horse for getting your period? 
O.M.G. 
Know how I celebrated getting my period? 
Stole a painkiller and half a beer from my mom's boyfriend. 
Wasn't a horse, but it was pretty awesome. 
How come there are no pictures of your mom? 
'Cause there aren't any. 
She cheated on my dad when I was five, and my grandmother got rid of her. 
Not in, like, a mob way. 
In a society way, which is worse. 
So who raised you? 
Well, Estella from 1989 to '96. 
Then, Dominica from '97 until she went back to Guatemala. 
Then no one. 
Funny. 
You didn't have a father, and I didn't have a mother. So we're 
Oh, we're alike? 
Look around. 
We have nothing in common. 
Hey, what's this button for? 
Music. 
Oh, lemme guess. 
Show tunes? Boy bands? 
Both: I love this song! 
 You are the girl   that I've been dreamin' of   ever since I was a little girl   you are the girl   that I've been dreamin' of   ever since I was a little girl   One! 
I'm bitin' my tongue   Two! 
He's kissin' on you   Three! 
Oh, why can't you see?  
 do do do do do do do   do do do do do do do   do do do do do do do   Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!  
 Dance! Dance! Dance! 
Dance! Dance!  
See? 
I knew what we had in common wouldn't last. 
Were you crumping for a second? 
Maybe. Were you 
tootsie-rolling for a second? 
Yes. 
Okay, get dressed. 
We really should go now. 
I have all the essentials. 
Tampons, toilet paper, comforter, body shimmer. 
Wait, what about the clothes? 
Oh, what am I gonna do? 
Walk around Williamsburg in a $3000 gown? 
Oh, my God. 
Wait a minute. 
Grab everything with a price tag on it that we can resell. 
Or that you think I'd look amazing in. 
Not the furs! 
They're wired! 
Why would you wire the furs? 
Everybody wires the furs, bitch! 
Security's gonna be here in ten minutes. 
Just grab everything you can. 
Wait! How are we going to 
carry it all back to Brooklyn? 
Jealous? 
Look, two seats. 
I think you got more stuff than me. 
Well, you spent five minutes saying good-bye to the tub. 
This was my fa purse to take dancing. 
How'd you keep it on your shoulder when you went all mad crump? 
Look. 
$200! 
It's not enough we're sitting on the subway in furs... 
You gotta make it rain? 
This is so exciting. 
It's going right into our cupcake fund. 
 Or  Or what? 
Where was that place you always went with your dad? 
Toro with black truffle. 
You are about to have a sushi toro-gasm. 
Will you calm down? 
It's just Oh, sweet bejesus, that's delicious! 
If this is sushi, what was that other stuff we ate? 
Wrong. 
On every level. 
We need more of this. 
Like, all of it. 
Can we have some more toro? 
Thank you so much. 
And, uh... 
I get it now 'cause I'm rich. 
I don't know how you're pulling it off. 
What do you mean? 
Giving up everything that you had. 
The maids, the closet, the dentist, the sushi, the tub. 
All of it. 
The tub. 
I almost can't give it up, but I only had it for an hour. 
You're kind of a badass. 
Max, you just called me a badass. 
I'm drunk on black truffle. 
It's my dad! 
Wait, he actually exists? 
Like the townhouse and the tub? 
The tub. 
Hi, daddy. 
How are you? 
I miss you so much. 
I'm good. 
No, really. 
I'm still staying in Brooklyn with my friend, Max. 
She's great. 
Oh! 
Oh, okay. 
Hold on. 
Love you, daddy. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Me? Why? 
I wouldn't know what to say. 
Take it! 
He's only allowed five minutes. 
Yo, what's up, Martin Channing? 
Oh. 
You're welcome, but I di Well, thank you. 
Yeah, she's great. 
Real trooper. 
Well, bye. 
What? 
Okay, I'll tell her. 
Daddy? 
He's gone. 
So that's what a father sounds like. 
What did he say? 
He wanted me to remind you to wear your bite guard. 
See, he can't be as bad as everyone says. 
He just can't be. 
Oh, my God. 
The 200 didn't cover it. 
Start checking the purses! 
Oh, hey. 
Do you take hats? 
Any cougars in the house? 
And in case you don't know, "cougar" means older lady with a large sexual appetite. 
Lady past prime with tight clothes who wants sex from young men. 
Max, what is the one thing worse than karaoke? 
Oh, no. 
That's right. 
Open mic night. 
Cougar also have face lift. 
From behind, look 22. 
She turn around, 72. 
It's true! 
It's funny 'cause it's true. 
Bad news. 
They heightened security because we tripped the alarm. 
The entire townhouse is locked down. 
We can never go back! 
My tub! 
Why does anything that gives me pleasure wind up behind bars? 
Forget about the tub. 
Everything was inventoried. 
We can't sell the furs. 
I should've thought of that! 
Yeah, you should've. 
'Cause you know they always inventory the furs, bitch! 
One steak sandwich and a cheeseburger with muenster cheese. 
We're out of muenster. 
Oh, since when? 
Well, let's see, the diner opened in '82. 
So '82. 
Hi, sorry but we're out of muenster. 
Seriously, dude? 
I wanted muenster. 
Sorry, we have cheddar, Swiss or American. 
I hate cheddar and Swiss blows. 
Well...Then American? 
American cheese? 
What am I, at grade school? 
Yeah, go to the principal's office. 
I can't have another idiot up my ass right now. 
It's at capacity. 
Max, I got this. 
Would you like to see the menu again? 
This is crap, okay, I wanted muenster. 
Well, I wanted to be running a Fortune 500 company instead of waiting on a toxic man-child like yourself. 
But, we can't always get what we want. 
So, order something else, put it in your pie hole and get on with your damn life. 
Welcome to waitress. 
We've been expecting you. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Here you go, table ten, Earl. 
Have any exciting plans for tomorrow? 
Just trying to not die in my sleep, Max. 
How about you? 
I'm going to visit Caroline's horse. 
He was adopted by a rich white lady who could give him everything we couldn't afford to. 
Which is everything. 
White people will adopt anything. 
I figured out the best way to go see Chestnut. 
We take the J train to the 4, the 4 to Grand Central, change trains to Riverdale and walk three blocks to his fancy new stable. 
Sounds exotic. Do I need a travel shot? 
No, but there's a dicey underpass at Grand Central where we might get shot. 
I am so excited to see my baby again. 
Me too. 
In the Lifetime movie version, we get there and Chestnut likes his new home better and then we cry. 
Excuse me, Hi. 
Sorry to bother you. 
I'm Rhya, I'm a little embarrassed. 
I just got my period. 
Mazel tov. 
Do either of you have a tampon? 
Not me. 
I just go off into the woods and don't come out until it's over. 
I have one. 
I'm so sorry to bother you guys. 
No problem, "Sisterhood of the Traveling Panty Shields" Actually, no, I don't have one. 
Here's a quarter, there's a tampon machine in the ladies' room. Thanks. 
Pick up, table six. 
I couldn't help overhear. 
I have tampon. 
Oleg, why do you have a tampon? 
Same reason I carry a lighter, even though I don't smoke. 
Feels good to be the hero. 
Sorry, again, but do you have any more change? 
It's 75 cents. 
It's a quarter. 
75. Says so on the machine. 
It better not or I'm about to rage against the machine. 
What? 
Han, I need to see you in here now. 
But that is the ladies' room. 
You're fine. 
Women bring their little boys in here all the time. 
Everybody decent? 
Man in the ladies' room. 
I apologize for personal intrusion. 
You don't have to cover your eyes. 
It's a ladies' room, not a solar eclipse. 
Max, why do you want to see me in this inappropriate meeting place? 
This is why. The tampon machine. 
Oh, this is not man topic. 
I do not wish to discuss time of the month when ladies must chase the cotton mouse. 
Chase the cotton mouse? 
Geeze, where'd you get your sex education? 
Lambchop's playalong? 
Han, you changed the price of tampons? 
Yes, this is not appropriate talk. 
No, this is not appropriate action. 
They've been a quarter forever. 
Look how old this machine is. 
Harriet Tubman used to get her tampons here. 
I'm a businessman. 
Emphasis on the man. 
I do not belong in here. 
Hey, hey! 
Don't make me chase you, you little khaki mouse. 
Look, han, everyone knows there are certain things that people need in an emergency that you never raise the price on. 
Things like what? 
Off the top of my head, tampons and 40-ounce beers. 
Max, why are you so upset? 
It is only two more quarters. 
Han, that's a 200% price hike. 
That's outrageous. 
You're taking advantage of women. 
If men were the ones who got periods, tampons would be thrown free from floats like Mardi Gras beads. 
I went to Mardi Gras once... I was 11. 
My mom and her new boyfriend wanted to go, and they needed a designated driver. 
Earl, I need a man's opinion. 
Is it my right to raise the price of any product in my diner? 
What product are we talking about? 
Tampons. 
Oh, brother. 
Uh, you gotta just relax and butt out. 
Trust me. 
I been in this situation a long time. 
Remember Aunt Flo? 
That was my aunt. 
Han, just because you can take advantage of a business situation, doesn't mean you should. 
It is law of supply and demand. 
Fine, then I demand you roll back the price on the supply. 
Come on han, don't be so 1% about it. 
You think occupy Wall Street was a big deal? 
Wait till you see occupy tampon. 
We only protest once a month, but it's an intense five to seven days. 
Got it. Found the milk. 
And I found it even faster than the butter. 
You know they're not hiding it from you. 
It's a grocery store, not a sorority scavenger hunt. 
Grocery shopping is so fun. 
When I was little, I always wondered where this stuff came from. 
What's that? 
Birthday card for my mom. 
Aww, let me see. 
"Get better soon"? 
I thought you said it was a birthday card. 
It is, that's the only one that seemed appropriate for our relationship. 
Do you really want your mom to get a get well card on her birthday? 
Okay...Here's one with a 
strawberry, that's fine. 
It's really about the 50 bucks inside anyway. 
That makes me sad. 
Sad? I can fix that. 
Have a treat, it'll perk you right back up. 
Max, you just stabbed a bag of candy. 
That's okay, they'll just think a gang came through and did it. 
A candy gang? 
What, like the sour patch kids? 
Just step away and pretend you didn't do it. 
That's what you do. 
We just need to grab ten boxes of Duncan Hines cake mix and we're done. 
Why would we need to do that? 
Why do you think? To make the cupcakes. 
I thought the cupcakes were homemade. 
They are, I make them in my home. 
You've been using a boxed cake mix? 
Relax, I only use it when I'm tired. 
And I add a secret ingredient of my own to the mix that makes them irresistible. 
So you have no shame using the store-bought mix? 
I've no shame about anything. 
Shame is overrated like Ke$ha. 
In fact, they should rename shame "keshame" I just bought a Ke$ha album, I'm so keshamed. 
Shouldn't there be someone to do this for us? 
Oh, he's probably in the aisle cleaning up after the candy gang. 
There was no candy gang in here tonight. 
That was a sneaky customer, now wasn't it? 
Hey, look. 
For Chestnut, I can't wait. 
I got him the kind with tops on them, like Bugs Bunny. 
He'll be so excited when he sees the two of us tomorrow. 
I know. 
I was talking about me and the carrots. 
All right now, your total is $70.49. 
Wow, that seems like a lot. 
I don't make the prices, now do I? 
No, I was just commenting. 
Well, it's not CNN, now is it? 
 Here, give her the coupons. 
 The coupons? 
Yeah, here. 
Max, you use coupons? 
I had no idea. 
You're looking at me like I'm on To Catch a Predator. 
We don't need to use those, I have my tip money right here. 
What are you talking about, I have coupons. 
Here, take them. 
I...I have... 
I can't, I don't want to. 
I've fallen so far, I can't fall any further. 
Don't make me. 
There's no need to go down a keshame spiral. 
Hi, she has coupons. 
Oh, now you tell me you have coupons? 
Should have told me before, now shouldn't ya? 
I didn't wanna tell you at all, she made me. 
Now didn't ya? 
Look, it's not a big deal. 
Lots of people use coupons. 
Coupons are for... 
poor people, yes. 
Like us. 
People who stand at the cash register and say things like, "Wow, $70? That seems like a lot." 
Your new total is $12.70. 
Wait, it just went from $70 to $12? 
Just like that? 
The same food for less money? 
The exact same food? 
How is that even possible? 
You used coupons, now didn't ya. 
Max, coupons are genius. 
I'm late, I know. 
I just got a text from Chestnut. 
"Where are you? 
I'm wearing my best suit." 
He spelled suit with a four, but that's pretty good for a horse. 
I have a good reason. 
15 chicken pot pies. 
Regular price: $1.47. 
Coupon price: Free! 
'Cause I bought 15 and used the double coupon in-store sale combo. 
Listen to me with the lingo already. 
Reminds me of my first day interning on Wall Street. 
Chicken pot pies? 
You don't even like them. 
What does it matter if I like them or not? 
They were free. 
It's free money. 
Who doesn't like free money? 
I don't know about free money, but this is like watching someone free base for the first time. 
Chestnut's fine. 
It's not a big deal. 
Ooh, oh, I just got another text from Chestnut. 
"I'm so lonely, I just tried smoking." 
We can go tomorrow. 
In the Lifetime movie version, we just missed the day we were appointed by the court, and Chestnut's new parents move him out of town. 
And we cry. 
I get it, it's just that after last night, I woke up fascinated by the concept of coupons. 
So I did some research. 
I found this woman online who calls herself the Williamsburg Coupon Queen. 
Only she calls them "cue-pons." 
Is that the correct way to pronounce it? 
Eh, I'm gonna go with her way after all, she is the queen. 
Canned pumpkin? 
Ten cans, double coupon, five cents each. 
Great, 'cause I'm always lying in bed at night thinking I wish I could crack open a can of pumpkin. 
Oh, and I found a coupon for you to send your mom an edible arrangement for her birthday. 
A pretty pineapple daisy says so much more than cash in a card. 
And it's for 40% off the regular price. 
That's perfect because my mom was 40% off a regular mom. 
And Max, I do have something else for you in this bag. 
Something that'll make you very happy. 
Canned yams for when I get tired of canned pumpkin? 
Better, look. 
Look out, Han Lee. 
I'm about to get my tamp on. 
Well well, if it isn't everything that's wrong with the current economy, in a boys' v-neck sweater. 
Oh, what do you think you are doing? 
Oh, just putting straws in the container... 
In case, uh... 
Just in case a woman might suddenly need a straw and not have 75 cents. 
Those are not straws. 
They do not belong in public. 
Didn't your mother ever teach you that is secret, no-no private lady thing? 
You can't even say the name. 
Come on Wall Street, if you can sell it, you should be able to bring yourself to say it. 
I will never speak of it. 
Just say it. Tampon, tampon, tampon. 
What's the big deal? 
In Ukraine, there are pop songs about it. 
She's so pretty, she's so grouchy. 
That is inappropriate counter display. 
You take it down. 
You take down the price and I will. 
No, it is free market. 
I charge what I want. 
I am the boss. 
Max, someone left a stack of newspapers filled with cue-pons, and look, a double for Duncan Hines. 
Could this day get any better? 
Oh, and tables four, seven and eight want their checks. 
Okay. 
Have 'em ready right here. 
Max, no, that is private! 
Here's your check. 
And a little something extra, compliments of women without three quarters everywhere. 
Thank you very much. 
I don't know about your flow, so I gave you a regular and a super. 
Max, have you no shame? 
Nope. 
Ladies, at that time of the month, I invite you to think of this man. 
This man, Han Lee, right over here. 
The man who thinks your menses should be more expenses. 
Okay, okay, I will lower the price back to a quarter. 
And that is end of discussion, period. 
Oh. 
Tampons for everyone. 
Max, you are the Norma Rae of feminine hygiene. 
It's so windy. 
Choosing coupon shopping over going to see your son again? 
That's a keshame. 
In the Lifetime movie version, this is where they take you away as an unfit mother. 
And I don't cry. 
I'm sorry, but I just saw that all these cake mix cue-pons expire today. 
I'll be real quick. 
Ten minutes, in and out. 
If I had a cue-pon for every time I heard that from a guy. 
Here, start going through these papers and look for the cake mix double cue-pon. 
If I combine these with the in-store bonus, not only will we get the lower cue-pon mix price, but they will actually give us $23 back! 
I'll give you $24 to stop saying cue-pon. 
Come on, start pulling out the ones for the cake mix. 
It'll be a breeze. 
No, that was a breeze. 
My cue-pons! 
The fact that you're more worried about your coupons than your hair shows how far you've fallen. 
Oh, my God, I can't believe it. 
Max, it's the Williamsburg cue-pon queen. 
Where'd she leave her crown, in the minivan? 
This is so exciting. 
I have to go pay my respects. 
We don't have time for this. 
Just throw the cake mix into the cart or we'll miss the train. 
There, calm down, have a treat. 
I'll be right back. 
Excuse me, your highness, but aren't you the cue-pon queen? 
Mm-hmm. 
I'm Caroline. 
Freddie, and I can't talk right now because if I lose my place... 
 you'll lose your mind! 
 I'm gonna lose...My...Mind... 
I know. You say that on your show. 
I won't bother you, but I think you'll be excited when I tell you that it's only my second day and I already learned how to make money on the purchase of cake mix. 
All I have to do is buy 40 boxes and we get the... 
store bonus, yeah. 
Cake mix... That's a rare cue-pon. 
Where'd you find it? 
Yesterday's circulars. 
Didn't you see it? 
I missed it. 
Go to the truck and get the stockpile of circulars. 
Look at him go. 
You're sweeping the shelves. 
On your show, you said sweeping the shelves was out of line. 
Max! 
These are mine, I was here first. 
I think she's probably gonna be here last, so let's go, we don't need these. 
We do, if we don't get 40 boxes, they won't be free. 
I've met actual queens and this isn't royal behavior. 
Max, she just body-checked me. 
Push me again and I will report you to the American embassy. 
Max, get in here. 
Oh, we got a problem? 
Oh, we got a problem. 
Oh, hell no! 
What do we do? 
You step away and pretend you didn't do it. 
That's what you do. 
24, 25... 
you're making me wait, now aren't ya? 
Just till I get to 40. 
26, 27, 28. 
Come on, I'll buy it for you. 
Come on, take up the bitch on his offer and let's go see Chestnut. 
Max, shh, I'm counting. 
If we don't have the exact right mix-to-coupon ratio we won't get our free money. 
Okay, where was I? 
Amateur. 
Real mature, your highness. 
We have places to go. 
Okay, 40. 
Take it away, Tanya. 
Wait, what is this? 
This isn't Duncan Hines, it's Pillsbury. 
Where did this come from? 
I put it in. 
You can't do that. 
It has to be all Duncan Hines. 
I needed Pillsbury. 
Well, you can't have it. 
 I need it! 
 Why? 
 I need it! 
 Why? 
That's the secret ingredient. 
I throw a spoon of Pillsbury in the Duncan Hines. 
Pillsbury? 
That's what makes it you? 
That's what makes it more delicious. 
Tanya, stop, flag on the play. 
Here, take this back and get me another. 
You know what, I'm just gonna go see Chestnut while I still have time. 
No, Max, please take this back and get me another one. 
You're the one who wanted to use the store-bought mix instead of making your own from scratch. 
So go back and get me another mix. 
I used the mix because I don't know how to make my own. 
No one ever taught me. 
No one taught me how to bake. 
No one taught me how to use tampons. 
No one taught me anything. 
You still think I should send my mom a better gift? 
And no one taught you how to check out, either. 
I'm going. 
Max. 
You need to get another mix, now don't ya? 
I'll go get it, won't take a minute. 
Who's the queen now? 
Hey, my dude. 
Look at you and your fancy coat. 
Retirement looks good on you. 
Told you I'd come by to see you. 
Hooked you up with some carrots. 
Bugs Bunny status, like I know you like. 
I, uh, I don't know if you got my text. 
Probably not a great signal in here, but... 
Your mom might be a little late. 
She's coming though 'cause I know she's dying to see you. 
All right, man, who am I kidding? 
She's not coming. 
I know that's hard to hear, and trust me, mothers not showing up, I've been there. 
But, I know wherever she is, she is thinking of you. 
Okay, that's not true either. 
Here's the thing. 
Your mom is a flake. 
And you got two options, you can sit around feeling sorry for yourself or you can say, "Hey, my mom's not here." 
"I can watch TV all day and then go kick in a neighbor's window because I feel like it." 
Hey. 
Hey, look at me. 
The fact that she's not here is not your fault. 
It's hers. 
There, I just saved you, like, 14 inappropriate sexual encounters. 
Hi. 
Hey. 
Hi, Chestnut! 
Hi, baby. 
Aw... 
I missed you. 
I missed you so much. 
Did you miss me? 
So you got all the cake mix? 
Yes, plus the $23. 
And I got you your Pillsbury as well. 
Paid full price... it killed me. 
You are a freak with the coupons. 
I know. 
I don't know what came over me. 
When I found a way to make free money I forgot about everyone else. 
Oh, my God. 
Like my father. 
Max, I have Ponzi DNA. 
Yeah, cou-Ponzi DNA. 
Must have been hard learning to do everything on your own. 
I mean, I don't know how to do any of that stuff either, but, I had a staff of 20. 
Yeah, I got staph at 20. 
You know, you may think your secret ingredient is a spoonful of Pillsbury, but it's not. 
It's you. 
It's everything you've been through that makes you who you are. 
Someone who fights for a box of tampons and fights for a horse's feelings and even fights for a box of cake mix when a friend in the middle of a cue-Ponzi panic, asks her to. 
This is the part in the lifetime movie version where I get up to pee. 
I don't know who you're kidding. 
You watch the entire movie and then you cry. 
Listen to her, Chestnut. 
She thinks she has me all figured out. 
What she doesn't know is that when it comes to the cupcakes, I have another secret, secret ingredient. 
Oh, don't tell me it's a pinch of Betty Crocker. 
I can't tell you. 
It's a secret ingredient. 
Okay, it's chocolate methamphetamine. 
No, it's true. 
Our slogan should be: They're so good, you'll rob your grandmother. 
Evening, ladies. 
Gals' night out? 
Chasing guys, eating pie, having fun. 
This table is sticky! 
Run a damp rag across it! 
Would it kill you to clean a little? 
What kinda place is this? 
The kind that serves soup cold. 
And what's with your crazy earrings? 
What are you, some kinda gypsy? 
Whoa! 
Hold up, ladies. 
You don't get a bitch pass just 'cause you're old. 
Yes, that's right. 
I said it. 
You come in here with your gangster granny attitude, think you can get away with dumping all over the lowly gypsy waitress. 
No way. At this diner, we don't 
discriminate due to age. 
If you're gonna act like an ass, I'm gonna treat you like an ass... 
No matter how close that ass is riding to the floor. 
Now, I'll wipe off the table we'll take it from the top. 
Hi, I'm Max. 
Who wants tapioca? 
That's more like it. 
Save the disappointment for the grandkids. 
Earl, I need another book of checks. 
The last one fell between the refrigerator and the oven. 
I'd reach for it, but that falls between "I don't do that" and "Oh, hell no." 
Look overthere, Max. 
Men and women in suits. 
This neighborhood is definitely on the rise. 
I remember a time when a black man couldn't get a cab around here. 
And that time was Wednesday. 
Max, I was just talking to the smart couples in booth two. 
I know they're smart because they're the first people in here who ever ordered the croque monsieur as croque monsieur and not "crock monster." 
They wanna meet the woman who made the cupcakes. 
I told them you'd be right over. 
 Go! They're so nice. 
 No, they're not nice. 
They're trendy, blood-sucking locusts who come into this neighborhood to pillage and destroy everything I care about. 
I felt the same way when the Hilton sisters crashed my 21st birthday. 
What? 
You made these cupcakes? 
Yeah, what's the problem? 
Spit it out, I've got a life. 
We just wanted to tell you that your flavor palate is... 
amazing. 
I don't know who you are or where you came from Neither do I. 
But these are fabulous. 
Well, welcome to the neighborhood. 
I knew I liked you guys. 
So what did the trendy locusts want? 
You are so judgmental, you know that? 
They wanted to tell me the cupcakes are "fabulous." 
Thank you. 
Maybe now you'll finally start to get it if someone besides me tells you how good they are. 
I believe the word was "fabulous." 
Pick up, Max. 
Oleg, from now on, you may call me Countess Max of the Fabulous Cupcakes. 
And you may call me Sir Oleg of the Amazing Party in My Pants. 
Caroline, the happy, shiny people in suits asked me to give you this note. 
Oh, what a great idea! 
They suggested we sell Max's cupcakes at the cool new coffee place in their building. 
But you already sell cupcakes here in my diner. 
Han, we're building a cupcake business that will one day get us out of here. 
That's what we're trying to do with our lives. 
But I thought we had something special. 
Yes, but we're not exclusive. 
The diner's cute, but I want more than this. 
Oof. 
First girlfriend all over again. 
+ Hey, Johnny. 
Max has the tables against the wall. 
Oh, we're good in your section. 
Caroline, I want you to meet my buddy Carlos. 
Hi. 
Well, I'm working the counter. 
What's happenin'? Come on, dude. 
You have a literature degree from NYU. 
I didn't mean to say that, but when I get nervous, my Rico Suave comes out. 
It won't happen again. 
And here's two menus. 
What's happenin'? 
Dude, I'm nervous. 
Hey, guys, I'm in that section over there. 
Oh, we're good in Caroline's area. 
Well, if you like hot coffee in your pants area, you're in the right place. 
Actually, I like that. 
Coming right at you. 
Johnny's in your section. 
Yeah, why? 
He comes in here every night to see you. 
He's your friends or...crush or whatever he is. 
Shh! He's not a crush. He's a... 
I don't know what he is, but whatever he is, he's in your section. 
 Max! 
 Ooh! What are you doing? 
You're not supposed to be in here. 
I know, I'm a bad boy. 
Look, the reason I'm not sitting in your section is because my buddy Carlos is crushing pretty hard on Caroline and he asked me to do what I can to hook them up. 
Oh. So now you're a bartender, 
a street artist, and a pimp. 
Ain't nuttin' wrong with me pimpin' some boy on the side. 
Keeps me in spray paint and whatnot. 
So? 
From pimp to pimp... 
Help me out with your girl. 
My girl don't come cheap. 
Is it hot in here? 
Yes, and we're in a freezer. 
Yes. My freezer. 
I was, uh, just talking to Max. 
Um, I'll see you out there. 
So is this what you like in the men? 
No. He's just a 
customer that went rogue. 
He is weak and girlish. 
A woman like you needs a real man. 
You know what they say. 
Once you go Ukraine, you will scream with sex pain. 
That probably lost some of its sensual appeal in the translation, but thanks for the offer, Oleg. 
Cute, but I'm not interested. 
Besides, he's not my type. 
Just say it. 
You're not interested in him because he's Puerto Rican. 
Where did you get this idea that I would only date white guys? 
For your information, I've dated all kinds of men. 
I once had a Spaniard in Monte Carlo. 
Isn't the title of an Abba song? 
Are you sure about this? He's cute. 
And trust me, you could use a little salsa in your white rice. 
Max, I just lost every dollar I had. 
The last thing on my mind right now is guys any type of guy. 
Except this guy. 
Hi, Chestnut. 
I'm much more concerned with our business and getting my head back above water. 
Men will come sooner or later. 
Well, according to my research most men come sooner. 
Oh, I thought we should stop by that new coffee place tomorrow and introduce ourselves and your cupcakes. 
I'm not gonna walk in there. 
I feel like I'm selling out. 
Okay, let's reframe the phrase selling out and make it sold out, as in "Max, we sold out of the cupcakes" and are now successful." 
What's that you say? 
I can now afford to buy the wax dental floss again? 
Fine. 
But I'm only doing it so you'll eventually get your mind off the business and get laid. 
Why do you think I need to get laid so badly? 
If I'd just gone through all the tension and trauma that just happened to you, I'd be climbing telephone polls to take the edge off. 
Trust me, sex is the last thing on my mind right now. 
Oh, and speaking of reframing things, I have a surprise. 
I redecorated my room. 
I scoped out some cheap fabric in bedding places down on Houston Street. 
What do you think? 
I think you've made a vagina. 
What? 
Sister, you may think that sex is the last thing on your mind, but you turned your bed into a vagina. 
Do you think my vagina has curtains? 
I don't know how long it's been. 
I'm tired. I'm going to bed. 
Okay, but I still have to make the cupcakes to bring by that place tomorrow. 
I don't wanna keep you awake so why don't you sleep in my bed tonight and I'll pass out on your vagina? 
Okay, but you better buy me breakfast in the morning. 
I love this place. Looks 
like Paris in the '20s. 
More like poseurs in their 20s. 
Man, they've really cleaned this place up. 
You've been here before? 
Yeah, it used to be a liquor store owned by this old Irish guy who had freckles on his penis. 
Sometimes he'd corner you and flash it, but then he'd always comp you a free lotto ticket. 
Okay, well, let's try and keep that sort of charming nostalgia out of our sales pitch. 
Oh, that's the owner. 
I scoped it out before you got here. 
And remember, I'll do the talking. 
Why don't I get to talk? 
Freckled penis. 
And besides, I have more experience. 
All those who pitched business models to Warren Buffett as a member of the Phillips Exeter Entrepreneurs Club raise their hands. Holla! 
Well, if you care enough to raise your arms about it, fine. You talk. I won't say anything. 
Hi, what can I get for you? 
Hi, I'm Caroline and this is my business partner Max. 
 And you are? 
 Semhar. 
 Oh, jeez. 
 Such a pretty name. 
It means "light of the tiger" in Sanskrit. 
Oh, jeez. 
It's my yoga name. 
Help me, God. 
Well, Semhar, we just opened a local neighborhood cupcake company. 
Our card. 
We're introducing our exciting product to local boulangeries. 
Please try a sample. Max. 
Would you like coconut-coffee, chocolate-curry, or blueberry-lemon zest? 
My absolute fave is the coconut-coffee. 
Let's start with that, shall we? 
Thank you, but no thank you. 
Well, can I ask you why? 
They're not pretty enough. 
Excuse me? 
They're not pretty enough. 
Perhaps if you tried one, you'd see how amazing our flavor palate is. 
Hold off, Flava Flav. 
What do you mean, they're not pretty enough? 
They have a charming homemade look, but my customer would prefer a more upscale, prettier product. 
Just FYI, some upscale residents in this very upscale building where your upscale store actually is located recently told us they were fabulous. 
I understand. 
But they're not pretty enough. 
Listen, battlefield earth. 
This is Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and no amount of exposed brick and paint can change the fact that, right where you're standing, I've seen Tommy O'Hanlon's wing-wang more times than I care to remember. 
And I must say, it was way less offensive than your attitude. 
And you can shove that up your upscale. 
Let's go. 
 Namaste. 
 Namaste. 
+ What's with the empty hands, Max? 
No cupcakes tonight? 
No, they're bugging me. I 
decided to take the night off. 
Be careful with decisions like that. 
In 1987, I took a night off from earth, wind, and fire and the next day, they earth, wind, and fired my ass. 
Hi. Sorry I'm late. 
Mid-afternoon nap in your vagina? 
I wish! No. 
I went to a cheap bakery supply store in Greenpoint and got us some supplies. 
Here. 
It's the basic cake decorating kit. 
And best of all I found us a fun, reasonable two-session cupcake decorating class at a bakery. 
We can learn how to make pretty roses. 
No way. 
The cupcakes don't need to be pretty. 
They compensate by having a great sense of humor. 
Pretty cupcakes is just another option for our business. 
People want pretty, we do pretty. 
Or people want homemade, we do  Wait, where is our homemade? 
 I didn't make any tonight. 
You didn't make any? 
What, you get one piece of constructive criticism and you stop making them? 
Max, it's business. 
And maybe Semhar has a point about making them pretty. 
First of all, what does she know about pretty? 
The woman has dreadlocks. 
Her head looks like the stuff you empty out of a vacuum cleaner bag. 
Not pretty. 
Forget her. 
What's happening with you? 
What's your problem with pretty? 
Don't wave your divas live hand at me. 
I just think society's way too concerned with other people's idea of what's pretty. 
You don't think you can do it. 
That's what this is about. 
This isn't about society. 
You're afraid you can't do pretty. 
Look, I don't do pretty the way you don't do Puerto Ricans. 
What are you talking about? 
I'll do Puerto Ricans. 
All right. 
Then go do one and leave me alone. 
Max, it's a skill. That's all. 
It's not shameful to not know how to do something. 
Didn't you have piano lessons growing up? 
Seriously? 
Ice skating? 
Closest I've come to blades on ice was when a pregnant girl pulled a knife on me at a hockey game. 
Look, you and I have a business, and this is a skill we need. 
We're going to that class and we are gonna master how to make pretty roses. 
And I know how much you hate anything trendy, so I found us a family-owned Italian bakery in Brooklyn. 
Italian's good. 
Maybe they'll know how to dump the body after I kill you. 
First of all, welcome to Spice and Sugar. 
We did a little twist on the traditional sugar and spice putting spice first because... 
We're Italian. 
And we always got the spice up front and a little in the rear. 
Holla! 
Now are you embarrassed you ever said holla? 
My name is Stephanie, and this is my cousin Serena, and this bakery has been in our family for years and then we took it over and made it... 
Hot. 
All right, let's go around and introduce ourselves and tell us why you came tonight. 
Let's start with the cute guys. 
Always! 
I'm Steve, I thought this would be a fun idea for my bachelor party. 
I'm getting married to Michael...right there. 
So cute. God bless! 
And I'm Michael. 
 I'm Michael as well. 
 Michael. 
Oh...So many Michaels. 
 And you are? 
 Michael. 
No, I'm Max. 
Oh, she's funny. So cute, God bless! 
And I'm Caroline. I'm Max's partner. 
 Oh, so many gays tonight. 
 I know. 
No, I'm her business partner. 
We actually have our own cupcake business over in Williamsburg, and I must say, we're doing very well. 
Max is the baker and I'm the business head and we're here tonight to increase our skill level and take our business up to a level that's... 
Hot as well. 
If you're gonna talk that much, no one will have time to learn anything. 
I know, right? 
So, uh, where's your shop? 
Well, right now, we're just working out of our apartment. 
 So no shop. 
 Oh, that's sweet. 
 Cute. 
 Yeah, good luck, God bless. 
Can you say jealous? 
All right, let's start simple with a pretty little icing flower. 
Everybody pick up your piping bags, and with a straightedge tip But you guys can use your gay-edge tip. 
All right, everybody watch Stephanie. 
You're gonna take the nail head and you're gonna make a little "U" so that you get little petals. 
And we'll do this five times. 
And then, you have a pretty little five-petal flower. 
 Simple. 
 So cute. How fun! 
No, no. You gotta 
start by making a "U". 
I did. That's a "U". 
 Serena, is that a "U"? 
 Not a "U". 
Fine, I'll start over. 
That was a "U". 
And what, just because I don't have a quote-unquote shop I don't know a "U"? 
What's with the attitude? 
All right, let's leave. 
Next time the gays giggle, we'll just slide out. 
No, we're here to learn. 
That looks good. 
I suck. I'm starting over. 
Max, why'd you do that? It was good. 
Not good enough. 
You two not done yet? 
You have to master the little flower, or when we move on to roses you'll be screwed. 
 Right, cuz? 
 Oh, totally screwed. 
Screwed and not in the good way. 
Do you think we can convince them that slapping each other's face is the new high five? 
Steve, oh, my God. 
That rose is gorgeous. 
Good for you. 
All right, one more minute and we'll display our roses. 
Psst. Steve. Little help. 
I choke at timed tests. I 
got like a 40 on my SATs. 
Damn it, Steve! 
Look at this place. 
There's no way these girls could have this much cupcake success in this economy. 
I mean, the overhead on this building alone What are you saying? 
Not saying mob money, just saying maybe we'd have a shop too  if we had mob money. 
 Shh. 
Keep it down. 
You wanna wake up tomorrow with Chestnut's head in your vagina bed? 
Okay, time's up. 
Let's see what you got. 
What is that? There's 
like nothing there. 
That's not a rose. 
 It's minimalist. 
 Whatev. 
No, not "whatev". It's brilliant. 
And I would know because, when I was in Tokyo, I had a private Japanese flower arranging class with the head of the Ikebana institute. 
And he said I had a gift. 
In his words, "Caroline..." 
Whatev. Okay, what 
about your friend there? 
I kinda ran out of time. 
You had 20 minutes. 
I thought she said you were the baker. 
No, you need to be able to whip these out in like 20 seconds if you wanna be successful in your little bakery. 
"Um, I'd like a cupcake." 
"That'll be 12 hours." 
 Right? 
 Right. 
And they have to be prettier than that. 
Well, maybe you'll do better tomorrow. 
Remember. Your homework assignment 
is to bring in a cupcake with a pretty rose on it. 
Right. 
Like we're gonna come back here and spend time with these Robert de Nir-hos. 
Ugh! That one stinks too. Damn it! 
Max, forget it. 
It's 3:00 A.M. 
Go to bed. 
Don't. Don't say anything to me. 
I am so mad at you right now. 
 What did I do? 
 Everything. 
I used to love making cupcakes. 
It was the one thing I could zone out and do without thinking. 
And now all I'm doing is thinking. 
Thinking that I stink at making cupcakes. 
Well, stop it. 
Who cares what they think? 
They're bitchy baking bullies. 
We don't have to go back there. 
Oh, and then what? 
I'm gonna think my cupcakes weren't good enough for the rest of my life? 
You said we need the skill, then we need the skill. 
I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a quitter. 
I'm gonna make a stupid, pretty cupcake if it kills me. 
Or you. 
And you are going back there with me. 
And we're gonna shove our pretty cupcake right up Snooki and her cousin's asses. 
Now, shut up, don't talk to me, and go back in your vagina. 
Sorry you had to see that, Chestnut. 
+ Oh, not very pretty. 
But at least you tried, Michael. 
Just one question. 
Are you sure that you're gay? 
Oh, okay, Caroline. 
Let's see your pretty rose. 
I didn't do one. 
Society is way too concerned with other people's idea of what's pretty. 
Whatevs. 
Okay, what about your baker there? 
She bail too? 
No, here it is. 
 Mmhmm.  
 Max, that's so pretty. 
I'm so proud of you. 
Good work, God bless. Good for you. 
How long did it take you? 
About three hours and 40 minutes. 
But I did it! 
I just wanted to prove to you and myself I can make something pretty. 
And now that I have Mm! 
That cupcake wasn't me. I don't do pretty. 
But I did make each of you a cupcake that I think says what I feel about this whole cupcake class. 
This one says "Bite me". 
This one says "Screw U". 
You see that "U"? That's a "U". 
Holla! 
Well, good luck with that. 
People don't want cupcakes that insult them. 
Oh, my God, Max. That's our thing. 
I was wrong. You were right. 
We don't need to make pretty cupcakes. 
Everybody does pretty. 
We have to do what you do best. 
Insult people. 
Yeah, who's gonna buy that? 
We will. For our shower. 
And really let us bitches have it! 
Max, Caroline, I have announcement. 
You're actually much shorter and are walking on stilts? 
I have made a special menu for tomorrow's Valentine's night dinner. 
Han, that's so romantic. 
Yeah, romantic and wrong. 
This place isn't When Harry met Sally. 
It's "When Harry met Salmonella." 
Max, Club Sandwich. 
And heads up... I lost a band-aid. 
Theme menu means I can charge one bigger price, like in top restaurants. 
See? 
"Prick fix." 
Oh, Han, it's pronounced "prix fixe." 
Have you seen our chef? 
It's definitely "prick fix." 
Tomorrow night, Cupid will come to Williamsburg diner. 
Didn't have the heart to tell him Cupid is dead. 
Yep, hit by a mack truck crossing the Brooklyn-Queens expressway... 
His fat, diapered baby ass splattered all over the windshield. 
I love Valentine's Day. 
That's your reaction? 
I killed Cupid. 
You're either romantic or not. 
I'm not even going to try to convince you. 
Oh, he's dead. 
And the proof... 
When's the last time you knew anyone who fell in love? 
Real love, like Ice Loves Coco. 
How about them? 
They've been holding hands and romantic whispering all night. 
Their romantic whispering goes like this. 
"I own nipple clamps." 
Plink! 
Cupid's not dead. 
Plink! 
There goes his little arrow. 
Plink, plink! 
Clamp, ouch! 
Clamp, ouch! 
Clamp, clamp! 
Ouch, ouch! 
Max, since it's just after midnight, it's now officially Valentine's Day. 
I've got something in here for you... guess what it is. 
Well, judging from that smile on your face, I'd say it's a finger-sized hole in your apron. 
Candy hearts! 
Here, hold out your hand. 
Let's get our heart on. 
I'm way ahead of you. 
"Be mine"... classic. 
What's yours say? 
"Caroline Channing is lame. 
"I hate you for giving me this. 
Valentine's Day is the worst." 
Ooh, cinnamon. 
Mmm. 
Good evening, Earl. 
My, my, my, Sophie, seeing you in that dress makes my heart race. 
Two scoops of ice cream in a one scoop cone. 
Oh, Earl, you make me smile. 
I wish we had black people in Poland when I was growing up. 
Too bad. 
We really would have enjoyed segregation and Hitler. 
Oh, hi, building neighbors. 
Well, I was just driving by, and since it was raining, I thought I could offer you two girls a ride home in my town car. 
The last time someone offered me a ride, I ended up in a drainage pipe in Jersey. 
Sophia, you rent a town car? 
Yes, but only when it's raining, because, you know, I got hair extensions and nail extensions, and, you know, I... 
I'm too extended to walk. 
Hello. 
I saw you from kitchen. 
You turned pick-up window into painting. 
Plink! 
Velvet painting of nude at counter. 
Clamp, ouch! 
The girls tell me you own cleaning service. 
I would like to hire you to clean my house. 
Oh, yeah, this is possible. 
I will send girl. 
What is your address? 
I don't want some girl. 
I want you to come clean. 
Oh, you cannot get me to come. 
Oh, I can get you to come. 
No, I can no longer come anymore. 
No, Max and Caroline can come. 
No, no, we're not coming. 
So no one can get you to come? 
Well, some people can get me to come... 
Just not you. 
Hard to get... I like it. 
Go get the coats. 
I'll get this check. 
Here's the last check, Earl. 
Oh, Max, can you take care of that for me, please? 
Sure. Why? 
Uh, nothing pressing... 
Just having a heart attack. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
Wait, you're having a heart attack? 
Most definitely. 
I've had three in my life. 
We're old friends. 
Earl, you're having a heart attack. 
I'll be fine. 
Have you seen my tangerine? 
I had a tangerine set aside for my walk home. 
Forget the tangerine. 
Earl's having a heart attack! 
Sophie, we're taking the town car to the hospital. 
Earl, when did the pain start? 
When I saw Sophie in that dress. 
Oh, hell, no! 
Why is this line so long? 
Did the new iPhone come out? 
Let's just get him over there. 
Max, anything you can do to move this along? 
Move! 
Celebrity coming through. 
Morgan Freeman having a heart attack. 
He is having a heart attack. 
On a scale of one to ten, what's your pain? 
Uh, two, we were just in the neighborhood, looking for a place to have jell-o. 
I was talking to Morgan Freeman. 
Take him now! 
Sir, he has a history of heart trouble. 
All right, we'll get him in. 
Earl, go with the nurse. 
Damn, it's a man. 
We'll be right out here, Earl. 
Everything is gonna be okay. 
Have a seat and wait. 
Look at me, Gingerbread. 
If anything happens to him, I will staple your nut sack to that chair. 
That's right... it's me again. 
For the tenth time, he's fine. 
He had a minor attack, but he's in good hands. 
I would know... I had both 
of my heart attacks here. 
I want to go back there and see for myself. 
Family members only. 
Well, I'm his daughter. 
Oh, really? It says here 
he's 75 years old... 
Well, he started late. 
And African-American. 
He started late with a honky. 
I'm one of those combo babies. 
Here... 
You need proof? 
My last name is Black, see? 
Max Black. 
He's black. 
I'm Black. 
It'd be dumb if we weren't related. 
Can I just get back to playing Angry Birds? 
You are yammering on here about nothing while the love of my life is back there alone and scared. 
You said he was your father. 
Now he's the love of your life? 
He's both. 
We're from the South. 
Have a seat. 
I got us two lattes. 
It took forever. 
The guy in front of me missed his kidney transplant waiting for a mocha frappuccino. 
 Any news? 
 The same. 
But they won't let me back there. 
I even told him Earl was my father. 
Now's my chance. 
Nurse Chewbacca's on the move. 
I'm going back there. 
If you see anyone about to notice me sneak by, draw all the attention to yourself. 
Max, I don't know if I can do that. 
You're right. 
That's kind of my thing. 
 Okay, let me think. 
 You don't have time to think. 
Just throw the coffees against the wall. 
That's ridiculous. 
I graduated top of my class at Wharton. 
I can do better than that. 
Paging Dr. Bender. 
Paging Dr. Bender, please. 
Oh, my God! 
Those were not nonfat. 
Earl! 
 You in here? 
 Max, is that you? 
Ain't you sweet? 
But you didn't have to wait around for me. 
This is Narcissus. 
She's from the Fiji Islands and gives one hell of a sponge bath. 
Hi. 
Can we have a minute alone? 
Earl, do you think this is a good time to have a sponge bath... 
I mean, in your condition? 
Max, when they look like that, there's never a bad time for a sponge bath. 
 So are you doing okay now? 
 Pretty good. 
The doctor said it was a mild one, but I'm going to have to stay here a couple nights. 
Could you find out how much extra for me to get my own room? 
A private room? 
The last time I was in one of these places, the guy in the bed next to me thought he was a parrot and asked me for crackers the whole damn night. 
Done. I'll get you your own room. 
And don't worry about the expenses. 
I got a little money stashed away for a rainy day. 
I am not using your money. 
But let me guess, "rainy day" is a strain of weed? 
Now you're getting it. 
I'll see you later. 
Don't die, or I'll kill you. 
So what, now you want a private room? 
How's he going to pay for that? 
Oh, so that old man has to be the only man in America who has to pay his medical bills? 
Mr. Freeman's done 
a lot of successful movies. 
I don't think your sarcastic attitude is very professional. 
"Professional"? 
Um, an hour ago, your little thug friend here threatened to cut me so deep, I'd have a vagina. 
That offer still stands. 
She's upset. 
And vagina's her go-to. 
Well, the only reason I haven't called security is they were laid off two weeks ago. 
What is your name? 
Tig. 
And it's fake, so good luck with that. 
Sir, you're representing the Shecter family wing of this hospital. 
My family knows the Schecters. 
In fact, their son David interns here, and if I made a call, he would not be pleased. 
If you know them, why are we talking to this lump behind a desk? 
Suck it, red face! 
We're going over your head! 
How do you like me now, bitch? 
Hey, get your phone. 
See if he can swing Earl a private room. 
I think I still have his cell number. 
We went out a few times until I realized he was serious about going down that pro Bono route. 
 Did you two have sex? 
 No. 
Sweet, that's what you can offer him for the room. 
That's amazing. 
Someone found a florist that delivers after midnight. 
That's not so amazing. 
I know a guy named "Sticky Icky" Ricky who delivers exclusively after midnight. 
You know, I just realized this is the first Valentine's Day I won't get flowers from my father. 
Aw, that's cute, with a big old side of creepy. 
No, it's sweet. 
Every year from the time I was a baby, and even when I had boyfriends, I'd get flowers from my father with a card that says, "You'll always be my Valentine." 
I got a sweet Valentine from a guy I liked in high school. 
It said, "I'll give you five bucks to lift your shirt." 
Caroline... 
Hey, I'll be right with you. 
There he is. 
Cuter than I remember. 
Hey. Wow. 
When I heard your voice mail, I couldn't believe it. 
Yes, well, I wasn't sure you'd want to come down, because... 
you know... 
You dumped me two years ago? 
Well, "dumped" is a strong word. 
Tore my heart out, shook it in front of my face. 
That any softer? 
Hate to interrupt the "perfect white teeth" convention, but we're in a hurry. 
David, this is my friend Max. 
A friend of ours was admitted, and we were hoping to get him a private room. 
Oh, so you're not here to return my Dartmouth t-shirt you stole from me. 
You gave that to me. 
No, I didn't! 
I love that shirt. 
I feel like I lost custody of it in a divorce, and now I'm like a deadbeat dad. 
How about the room? 
Any chance? 
Please. 
Pretty please. 
Oh, well, since you said "pretty please," I'll see what I can do. 
We should be clear. 
We can't pay. 
We're broke... 
both of us. 
But I'm sure you heard that somewhere. 
Yeah... 
Everywhere. 
David, I hope your family didn't lose any money with my father. 
Did they? 
Nope, still filthy rich. 
And I can do my best to burn some filthy off that rich, by getting your friend a V.I.P. room. 
I'll just drop some names. 
By that, I mean my own. 
Shouldn't be a problem. 
I love Jews. 
Yeah, we're generous. 
Spread the word. 
Uh, if you wouldn't mind giving Narcissus my whereabouts? 
Did you see the look on that desk lump's big, red face when I pushed you by him? 
I did, but I think throwing him the finger was a tad out of line. 
Wow, Dr. David really hooked us up. 
Yeah, this is like an episode I.C.U. Edition. 
So, Earl, what do you think? 
Good lord, is that a Matisse? 
 I believe so. 
 Then, mama, I'm home. 
Here, ladies, put these suckers in your station. 
I think I might get a late Valentine dinner crowd. 
You also think you might get a late growth spurt, but that's not happening either. 
At best, you'll get three single girls waddling over at midnight to cry into some tapioca. 
True. 
I need to cut the crap. 
Valentine's dinner is bust. 
And look, I have sacrificed my manhood for no cash value. 
But your wings are adorable. 
Yes, but matching panties are suffocating the boys. 
Come on, close early. 
We've only got one table of twi-hards. 
I want to go see Earl. 
Oh, what the hell? 
I love my man Earl, too. 
So screw it. 
Let's fly over there. 
Ooh, this isn't like the hospitals in Poland. 
The lights are working. 
Okay, sit down. 
I'll take you in one at a time. 
All right, Cupid, you're first. 
Oh, don't wake him. 
Go back out. 
Angels. 
Oh, lord, no. 
Thank God it's you, Han. 
I saw the wings, and I thought heaven was filled with chunky Chinese cherubs and no jazz. 
Oh, okay, great. 
I'll see you in five. 
I'm gonna go meet Dr. David. 
Oh, wait a second. 
If you're going to go meet man, you need lip gloss. 
Oh, thanks, Sophie. 
Oh, no, no, no, no. 
Okay. 
I have Valentine gift I want to give you. 
Oh, hepatitis "C"? 
Happy Valentine's Day. 
Look at me. 
Now look at you. 
Now look at me again. 
Does this look right to you? 
Hard to get... I like it. 
Oh, hey. 
So how's your friend doing? 
Good. 
And thanks for that V.I.P. room. 
He feels like a million bucks, which I'm sure is what it costs, so I brought you a little thank-you gift. 
That is not my Dartmouth shirt. 
No, that's held hostage at the townhouse. 
This says Williamsburg. 
That's where I live now. 
No way. 
That's where I live. 
Yeah, I moved there just to piss my father off, but I wound up loving it. 
I wound up loving it, too. 
Hey, maybe we could see each other there sometime... 
You know, go out? 
Yeah, I don't think so. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry, what? 
Look, Caroline, it's been really great getting to reconnect with you, but... 
I don't see this happening again. 
Oh. 
I mean, it's my parents. 
With your father in prison, the whole scandal, I could never bring you home. 
Not even just to piss off your father? 
I mean, me dating Caroline Channing... 
What would people think? 
I hope you understand. 
Oh, hey, thanks for the tee. 
Nice of everyone to stop by. 
Didn't see Caroline. 
She busy tonight? 
Oh, no, she's here. 
She's out there running around, trying to swing a boyfriend situation with her doctor friend who got us the V.I.P. hook-up. 
What about you, Max? 
No sweetheart on Valentine's Day. 
I worry about you. 
Be nice if you had someone special. 
I already do. 
Ah, Max, I'm only going to be around another 30 or 40 years. 
You better widen the net a bit. 
Visiting hours are up. 
Friends have to leave. 
She can stay, nurse. 
She's family. 
Earl, I'm family? 
Yes, and the best kind of family. 
You don't want my money. 
Hey, Earl. 
You look really good. 
So did you and Dr. Dave 
do it in a hospital closet? 
All very "Grey's Monotony"? 
No, that won't be happening. 
I asked him out and he said he could never date me, because of my father and "what would people think?" 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry, what? 
I feel like I was just hit by the same mack truck that killed Cupid. 
Well, somebody's about to get hit by a truck... 
A Max truck. 
Hey, you, Dr. I-Forget-Your-Name. 
How? 
It's written on every wall. 
Okay, Dr. Exit. 
What is wrong with you? 
Doctors are supposed to be sensitive. 
I mean, it's Valentine's Day, and she has nothing. 
Couldn't you be like every other guy on the planet and just lead her on and not call her the next day? 
That is the decent thing to do. 
And for the record, she is so hopped up on candy hearts, you would have gotten some tonight, fo' sho! 
You just made the biggest mistake of your life. 
Well, I guess nobody knows me better than you, girl I've never met before. 
And now I would like to speak to the pro Bono part of you, who understands that nothing I just said should affect that man in the V.I.P. room. 
That was actually a very cool thing to do. 
Earl is fine. 
Don't worry. 
And as far as Caroline goes, I'm sorry, but... 
Her father hurt a lot of people. 
Whatever you put out there comes back to you. 
Ugh. 
What now... you gonna threaten 
to feed me my nipples again? 
No. 
Actually, someone just said something about the things you do coming back to you, and I decided the smart move was to apologize. 
Thanks, but it's not necessary. 
Actually, you're the nicest person I've dealt with tonight. 
Ugh. 
Rough job, dude. 
Here, Happy Valentine's Day. 
You want to go out sometime? 
Why would... 
Yeah, give me your number. 
I'll call you tomorrow. 
Sleeping in that hospital chair all night wasn't that uncomfortable. 
No, the chairs weren't. 
Your sad Valentine whimpering was. 
 So how you feeling this morning? 
 Pretty good, considering I survived the very first Valentine's Day I didn't get flowers from my father. 
Ugh. 
So you got one year under your belt. 
Don't get so cocky. 
You still have to make 23 more to tie me. 
You know, all this time, I've been feeling sorry for you 'cause you didn't know your father, but after seeing how you took care of Earl... 
I feel sorry for your father that he didn't know you. 
You would have been a wonderful daughter. 
Don't hold that thought. 
I don't want to cry till after we break open the tapioca. 
No, I didn't just win a beauty contest. 
No, these were left on the front doorstep. 
They're both addressed to Caroline. 
 Sorry, Max. 
 Oh, no, that's cool. 
Wouldn't want to break my winning streak. 
Oh, well, just look at it this way. 
She got the flowers. 
You got the knockers. 
All right, girls, well, I'm off to buy scratchers before all the Puerto Ricans get them. 
"You'll always be my Valentine. 
Love, Daddy." 
Aw. 
The other one from Dr. Dave? 
Change his mind after I tore him a new one? 
It's from my father as well, but it's written to you. 
"Thank you for taking such good care of my sweetheart. 
M. Channing." 
That is so sweet. 
Roses from a man. 
Now I'm starting to get it. 
Is it weird that I kind of want to have sex with your dad? 
Plink! 
Hi, ready to order? 
Do you have anything that's really special? 
Not according to my high school guidance counselor. 
I'll have the veggie plate. 
But instead of beets, I want kale. 
And instead of broccoli, more kale. 
I want the veggies steamed. 
And instead of dressing, I want lemons. 
Don't you need to write this down? 
I'm afraid if I start writing that down, it'll turn into a suicide note. 
I'm assuming this table's gonna have a lot more of those requests. 
Yes, I could tell by the hats. 
Earl, I have something new I want you to try. 
That's the exact same sentence that got me hooked on cocaine in the '80s. 
It's my new cupcake flavor. 
Delicious dark chocolate the ladies can't help but love. 
I'm calling it "The Earl." 
I know you got that right. 
Hi, I'm here. 
I was running late so I decided to hail a cab. 
And then I remembered I didn't have any money on me. 
And then I remembered I didn't have any money at all. 
So I walked the whole way here. 
The apartment's three blocks away. 
Yes, I know. 
Three blocks and 15 "Hola chicas" away. 
Well, you can't be late again. 
I'm already worried about me being late... 
every month. 
On my way here, a homeless man asked me for money. 
And I told him that I usually always give, but that my father was indicted in a Ponzi scandal and I've lost my family fortune and my Manhattan townhouse, so I've been sleeping on a couch in Brooklyn, but, in spite of it all, I'm still optimistic that you and I will achieve success in our exciting new cupcake business venture. 
And look what he gave me! 
You took money from a homeless man? 
I prefer to think of Bob near the bridge as our first investor. 
Pickup! 
Special sandwich. 
I can think of even more special sandwich. 
You, me and the hot blonde giraffe. 
Well, she recently lost her dignity, so you might have a shot. 
Hello today! 
I have nametag for you. 
Only your second day and look, nametag already. 
As new owner, I am killing it. 
Thank you. 
Oh, it says "Carolin." 
It's Caroline. 
With an "E." 
I'm Caroline. 
As new owner, I am sucking it. 
Just put it on. 
You can't tell an Asian he made a mistake. 
He'll go in the back and throw himself on a sword. 
Thank you, Mr. Lee. 
You may call me Han. 
H-a-n. 
No trap in my name. 
I'm thinking we should take the first step in our new cupcake business by writing "Max's Homemade Cupcakes" up on the specials board. 
No, I can't have my name up there. 
Everyone I owe money to thinks I live in Seattle. 
Oh, we used to own Seattle. 
Max, we've got to get the name out there. 
Create a buzz. 
Ooh, good idea! 
Let's create a buzz. 
Exactly, in order to launch I'm mocking you. 
When in doubt, I'm always mocking you. 
Seriously, Max. 
This new cupcake business is our lifeline. 
A way out for both of us. 
And I wanna thank you again for letting me move in. 
If there's anything I can do to help you You mean besides starting to wait on tables? 
I meant, anything I can do to help you through your breakup with Robbie. 
Oh. Thanks, 
but I'm fine. 
And we're working. 
Well, one of us is. 
Are you sure you're fine? 
'Cause I heard you crying last night. 
I don't cry. 
I sold my tear ducts to an organ bank for cash two years ago. 
I was on the couch. 
And I heard you crying alone in your bedroom. 
Really? 
What did the crying sound like? 
Like... 
I wasn't crying. 
Well, then what were you d Oh! So none of 
my business. 
That's right. 
And remember that. 
Got it. 
In fact, let's just say that anything having to do with my bedroom, my tables, or my life you should stay away from. 
Boundaries. 
Got it. 
And please don't tell anyone at work I let you move into my apartment. 
That is one boundary we both don't want crossed. 
Why? 
Hey, roomies. 
That's why. 
Hope those sheets are okay. 
Oh, don't worry about it. 
I know they're the best you could afford. 
Not really. 
The good ones are on my bed. 
Max, that oven is so hot. 
Could you do me a favor and open the back door? 
We've known each other two days and you're already asking for back door? 
Dear God! 
I forgot you're Equestrian Barbie. 
You came with a horse. 
No. 
Out, horse, bad! 
Bad horse. 
Chestnut. 
No need to yell, he's a champion. 
Champion stink bomb. 
It's smelling pretty ripe out in that yard. 
That's not Chestnut, that's Brooklyn. 
Okay, well, I'm watching "The Champion" drop some steaming hot "Brooklyn" right now. 
Max, I've been thinking about how you completely overreacted to your name up on the specials board. 
Do you think it's a fear of success? 
I am too poor to have a fear of success. 
At Wharton Business School, we learned that every new venture can bring up a certain amount of fear. 
Is there any way to do a yelp review of Wharton Business School? 
Maybe you're having a hard time imagining this cupcake business could ever even happen because nobody ever believed in you or your dreams. 
I'm guessing. 
I can make this happen, Max. 
For me, for you, for us. 
Just keep making those amazing cupcakes. 
And I'll do the rest till you believe. 
I believe everything you just said and that children are the future. 
Max, it's me! 
I know it's you. 
You sleep with a knife under your pillow? 
It's the only home security system I can afford. 
And I'm a cutter. 
I can't sleep on that couch. 
I think Ikea might be the Scandinavian word for sciatica. 
And there's weird sounds in the street. 
And I don't have my white noise machine. 
Well, that's Puerto Rican noise. 
You'll get used to it. 
Can I just lay down here and get a little sleep? 
I don't even let the men I sleep with sleep with me. 
I can't get into your issues right now. 
I just need to sleep! 
Fine, get in then. 
What is that? 
Potato chips. 
I sleep-eat. 
Cool ranch and bacon? 
Dude, they're delicious. 
Because of your breakup with Robbie? 
Just get in. 
I have to be in the city to babysit in five hours. 
Oh, great, you're like a nightlight. 
You're so blonde. 
Thank you. 
Max, someone's in the living room. 
Max, someone's in the bedroom! 
Robbie! 
What's up, babe? 
Robbie, what are you doing here? 
We broke up. 
Still? 
Yes, still. 
You hit on me. 
And then she caught you with someone else in these very sheets. 
Which I'm hoping she washed. 
Oh, I get it. 
You blew me off 'cause you like the ladies. 
Which is cool. 
I like the ladies, too. 
And right now, it's the two ladies I like. 
Robbie, if I were gonna go lesbian, she would be the last "les" I'd "bian." 
Listen, babe You really hurt her. 
Stop. 
She sleep-eats trans fats thanks to you. 
Here, stuff all of these in your mouth. 
Got it, your thing. 
I'll be quiet. 
Robbie, this isn't cool at all. 
Mm-mm. 
Showing up here after what you did? 
You go, girl. 
I have something to say to you and you had better listen. 
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
What are you, the relationship ghost? 
Robbie, just go! 
I can't say what I need to in front of the relationship ghost. 
I'll call you to come get your stuff and we can talk then. 
Leave the key. 
Straight up, Max, you're breaking my heart. 
You're the only woman that I feel this way about. 
Here. 
Ladies, I don't know what's going on here, but it would've been a lot sexier if I was in it. 
Are you okay? 
If you wanna talk, I'm here. 
Can I get a hit off that? 
You think these are good? 
God, we're poor. 
Morning! 
It's a beautiful day. 
These shades belong down. 
From now on, think of me as a vampire without all the annoying marketing. 
Bad news. 
A pipe broke in the street so the water's off. 
Good news, when I went out to get us two coffees, I spoke to Juan and Javier, two city workers. 
And they assured me the water'll be on no later than 3:00. 
I also stopped at the health food store and got us a fresh-squeezed juice to split. 
It's ginger-apple-strawberry. 
That was the name of the hooker who had this apartment before me. 
What is this? 
From me. 
It says "Thanks for letting me sleep in your bed last night." 
I prefer my usual cash on the bedside table. 
When I went to the cute coffee place, I spoke to the counter girl, Nabulangi If someone named Nabulangi is making an appearance in the first sentence, I have to sit down. 
And she said her manager'll be in at 11:00. 
So I thought I'd chanel it up, walk on over there, introduce myself and your fabulous cupcakes. 
That's exactly what I was gonna do. 
I'm just gonna go say good-bye to Chestnut and get going. 
You know, having only one cute outfit takes hours off getting dressed. 
Oh. That is a lot 
of fresh Brooklyn. 
Morning, Chestnut. 
It's a beautiful No. Way. 
Look, Chanel Number Two. 
Tell me it's mud. 
T-tell me it's mud. 
It's mud? 
What is that? 
A carrot? 
There's carrots in the mud? 
There's no water. 
Oh, get it off me, please. 
Please do something. 
Just get it off me, get it off me. 
Stop! 
This is dry-clean only. 
Max, please, please take me somewhere they have a hot shower, I beg of you. 
Calm down, it's just mud. 
Max, please Don't touch me! 
Thank you so much for taking me to shower at your babysitting job. 
Well, I didn't have much of a choice. 
You pulled the pillow knife on me. 
I'll just introduce myself to your boss and tell her what happened. 
Look, I don't want Peach to know you were here. 
This is a job. 
Not a meet-and-greet. 
Got it. 
You get in there, you take a five-minute shower, clean it up and go. 
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway till she's gone. 
No need, just follow me in. 
She never really looks at me. 
Morning! 
Hi, Max. 
Go! 
Hey, Peach. 
Uh, hair and makeup. 
What's the big occasion? 
Pilates. 
Max, good news. 
They found a way to make diamonds more sparkly? 
I got Brad and Angelina a playdate with another set of twins in the building. 
It starts in five minutes. 
Cool, what are their names? 
6B. 
Bye-bye, Brangelina. 
Mommy loves you. 
Guys? 
Before you leave, stop at this one. 
Angelina could use a little help. 
Contour that neck, she's a fatty. 
Peach, come on, that's baby fat. 
Still, kids can be cruel. 
Don't you listen to your mommy, Angelina. 
She never eats. 
Oh, no, she doesn't. 
Here it is. 
Caroline with an "E." 
I have your new and correct nametag. 
Oh, thank you, Han. 
Oh. 
I've seen something I should not have. 
I will just put correct nametag here on counter. 
So sorry, but many thank yous. 
What are you doing? 
I know you said you don't want it up there. 
But now that you see it... 
How does it feel? 
It feels like you're not listening to me at this job or at my other job. 
I said a five-minute shower and get out. 
Did you take a nap at Peach's? 
The thread count was calling to me. 
Peach found blonde hairs in her bed and thought her husband was cheating on her. 
Which he is, but that's not the point. 
You almost ruined a perfectly happy fake marriage, and there are innocent children involved. 
Well, I have some good news. 
Look, it's Nabulangi. 
I invited her in to taste your amazing cupcakes. 
And when she loves them, we'll have an in at her bakery. 
Come over and say hello. 
No, I can't now. I wanna call 
Robbie before we get too busy. 
Tell him when to come over and get his stuff. 
Max, wait. 
No, don't distract me. 
I wanna sound cool and hot and all like, "You can't have me anymore, sucka." 
Max Robbie, it's me. 
Classy burp on your outgoing message. 
Max, I No. 
I need you to come get your stuff tomorrow. 
I don't know how you've been surviving without your chin-up bar and Axe body spray. 
Max, hang up. 
I already called him. 
You called Robbie? 
You've done so much for me. 
I wanted to do something for you, too. 
So I called Robbie and I had him come over, and I gave him his stuff. 
Now you won't have to go through with all that mess. 
And I think you'd be pleased, I really let him have it. 
What is with you and boundaries? 
You're in my bed, you're in my boss' bed, and now you go and call Robbie? 
You're like you're like your big-ass horse. 
Charging in everywhere you don't belong. 
I thought I was doing you a favor. 
In spite of what you say about the sounds I heard coming from your bedroom the other night, I know you're upset. 
I was masturbating. 
I love my job. 
I need to see you outside. Now. 
Don't get involved with her. 
She takes money from the homeless. 
Not true, Bob's an investor. 
Be right back. 
Good cupcake, right? 
Max, I don't know how smart that was, blowing by our only potential business contact. 
You stole my breakup scene. 
The only remotely good thing about breaking up with a guy is telling him how much better you are than him when you give him back his stuff. 
I don't know if you noticed, but my entertainment budget is pretty low and I was really looking forward to that. 
And then you went and stole it. 
But I guess you couldn't help it, 'cause that's what you channings do, you steal things. 
Huh. 
Interesting. 
Okay, you wanted a breakup scene? 
You're in one. 
I'm breaking up with you. 
Oh, okay. 
The cupcake business is over, the dream is dead. 
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi will be devastated. 
I don't need you or your cupcakes to survive. 
I'll figure something else out. 
Because, aside from your constant Wharton putdowns, I'm a business genius and I will always land on my feet. 
Oh, really? 
'Cause today you kind of landed on your front. 
We're done. 
After work tonight, I'll get my things and be gone. 
Ooh, you gonna load up your dream-filled wheelie bag and ride away on sir muds-a-lot? 
Go ahead. 
Be as negative as you want. 
'Cause you're in charge of your own future again. 
Oh, joke's on you. 
I don't have a future. 
Max... 
Are you up? 
No. 
Max, are you mad? 
Yes. 
Are you up and mad? 
No and yes. 
Oh, your bed's so soft. 
That's my boob. 
I know I moved out, but I came back. 
I took the rest of our dead dream money and bought some cocktails for myself and some people. 
And myself. 
Did you bring me back any of those? 
'Cause I can't listen to this sober. 
Max... 
I have nothing. 
I really need the cupcake business. 
I can be different. 
No, you can't. 
No, I can't. 
But I can be better. 
Please? 
Please, let's do this. 
I know you have a fear of success. 
You do, because no one ever believed in your dreams. 
But I believe in your dreams. 
We have a dream. 
God, you are so drunk. 
So you probably won't even remember this. 
I'm sorry I said that stuff about your father. 
Did you hear me? 
Max, are you up? 
Hey, do you have any more of those poor people chips? 
What's up, hangover three? 
Why are these up? 
I thought we were vampires. 
Here, I took the rest of last night's cupcake money, and brought you a coffee and a fresh juice. 
Which means that, after two days in business, we are $23 down from where we were. 
So we're still building our cupcake business? 
Sure. 
All we need is how much? 
$250,000. 
Which is awesome. 
Max, I'm sorry I crossed all those boundaries. 
It's cool. 
Me and drunk Caroline worked it all out. 
In fact... 
She signed this paper. 
"I, drunk Caroline, am a..." 
What's that word? 
Punk ass ho. 
Thanks. 
"I, drunk Caroline, am a punk ass ho. 
"I promise to keep my big mouth shut, "and replace all of Max's poor people chips. 
I will no longer meddle in her relation-chips." 
You laughed about that until you threw up. 
Oh, and if you're wondering, no, the puke stains will not void this contract. 
God! 
I forgot again that we have a horse. 
Max, get him out of here. 
He doesn't know I'm a waitress. 
Chestnut. 
He is a champion. 
He learned that a lot faster than you did. 
﻿1  Earl, can you break some 20s? 
The big spenders at table two Wanna split their $11 check three ways Even though one person did all the eating. 
 I was in a threeway once. 
Same thing happened. 
 Max, table ten would like the check. 
And don't forget to pick up customer comment card. 
Customers very important. 
It's all about the fans. 
 Yeah, I'm not a fan of hearing what people have to say. 
For instance, what's happening right now Not a fan. 
 Max, feedback from customers is very important business tool. 
Perhaps we'll pump the brakes on sour waitress attitude. 
 There's only one tool that can change my 'tude, But I'm gonna need two double-a batteries And a 20-minute break. 
 ¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶ ¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶  Welcome, everyone. 
Thanks for coming to very important First official diner meeting. 
 This ain't right, man. 
2:00 a.M. Starts earl time. 
 Earl, here's your brandy. 
 Okay, we're good now. 
 If I knew we were gonna have staff meetings after work, I would've taken job at t.G.I. Friday instead. 
Over there, they roll fast and loose. 
 Well, this is how I roll. 
 Yeah, short and slow. 
 No, I roll fast and furious. 
Tokyo drift style. 
 Han, I'm starting to drift. 
Can we get to the point? 
Max and I still have to get home and bake cupcakes for tomorrow. 
 We received so many excellent comments from customers tonight. 
Okay, first comment. 
"dark-haired waitress..." 
 hey! 
 "was very rude. 
 Hey! 
 Max, customers are giving Their honest opinions about diner. 
We need to take it seriously. 
"i'd like to ride the blonde waitress like a tilt-a-whirl." 
 Shout out! 
 Next comment. 
"why does cashier wear earphones? 
I thought he was a dj." 
Both: ¶ go, earl, go, earl ¶  Holla! 
 Moving on. 
"this meatloaf tastes stale and dry." 
Both: ¶ yeah, oleg yeah, oleg ¶  It also says that cook could wear deodorant And shirt that covers armpit. 
 This is on card? 
 Yes. 
 You are lying. 
 Yes. 
 Remind me never to be a spy with han. 
 So this is how you tell me what you think of me? 
You hide behind outdated method of feedback? 
 What, I should've posted twitpic of my face like this? 
 Maybe I will send you a twitpic of my meatloaf. 
 Can you twits pick another time to do this? 
I've gotta go home. 
 I have to go home too... 
And cut the remaining sleeves off of all my shirts. 
And then go buy more shirts And cut the sleeves off those shirts. 
 You must wear sleeves. 
 Do not tell me what to do. 
I was working here when you were still a dumpling On your father's chopstick. 
 Now this is starting to sound like earl time. 
 Did it light? 
 No. 
Try another one. 
The gas is on. 
Ah! 
 Why are we throwing fire at an oven? 
Is this a poor people game? 
 Yeah, it's called light the broken pilot light Without blowing our faces off! 
 This is ridiculous. 
My heart is pounding. 
I didn't know baking cupcakes was an extreme sport. 
It's like the deadliest batch. 
 See? A slight hint of gas 
in the air Makes everything funnier. 
Now there's too much gas. 
If we threw a math in there now, I'd be out a nose or a pair or a pair of eyebrows And I'm not living through that again. 
 Again? 
 When I was a little girl, I was trying to make a hungry man dinner And I lit the pilot light too soon and whoosh! 
No eyebrows. 
Had to draw them on in magic marker. 
Only mexican girls would talk to me. 
 Max, we have a cupcake business. 
We have to tell the landlord we need a new oven. 
 We can't ask the landlord for a new oven. 
Then he'll ask us stuff like "who are you? 
"why is your name not on the lease, And where's the rent?" 
 Well, I'll buy us one. 
 Really? You're gonna buy us 
a whole oven? 
We're so poor I have a sock that I refer to as my good sock. 
 I've been saving something for an emergency, Like a burst appendix or a first date bikini wax. 
 I knew it! 
You have a secret stash of your father's missing billions. 
We're rich! 
Wait, it's other people's money. 
Yeah, but I didn't steal it. 
We're rich! 
 They're my expensive rings. 
 So if these are your expensive rings, What's all that other stuff you wear? 
 Cheaper copies. 
You never wear the good stuff out in public. 
 Got it, kind of like hiding the banana republic And wearing the gap. 
 See how special? 
They're all one-of-a-kind from thomas aristotle thomas. 
T-a-t. 
Tat. 
 What? 
 Tat rings. 
You've never heard of tat rings? 
 Oh! Tat rings. 
No. 
 I guess it's the kind of thing That only people in the know know, you know? 
 No. 
 Make all the jokes you want, But I only have to sell one of these And I can get us a new oven. 
Any ideas what kind we should get? 
 Uh, yeah, you're not the only one with a secret stash. 
It's the bluestar. 
It's the tat rings of ovens. 
In purple! 
That's right, I said purple. 
It's the muscle car of ovens. 
It's bad-ass! 
It's so bad-ass when I do karaoke I change the lyrics from purple rain to purple range. 
 Great, we'll get this one. 
 Uh, we can't buy that. 
It's too expensive. 
This is just something you fantasize about. 
It's kitchen porn. 
 Fine. 
Tomorrow we'll go to the cash for gold store And get a regular oven and get cookin'. 
I think the funny gas is gone. 
 Must be time. 
I'm going in. 
Let me do it, my eyebrows need to waxed anyway. 
 Hurry up! The gas is on! 
Throw the match in! 
 Did it light? 
 No, but my foot is on fire. 
I'll do it. 
Both: You're good. 
 I'm sorry, but how much longer do we have to wait To get cash for our gold? 
 I told you before I'm on the phone. 
Sit down, shut up, don't be rude. 
 I thought she'd be nicer from her picture On the bus stop bench. 
 Yeah, and where are the dollar signs? 
 Let me see, which ring should I sell? 
So much history in my lap. 
 I don't even wanna tell you about the history in my lap. 
 My father got me this one in london. 
I got this one in paris to reward myself For not crying during the turbulence On the flight to paris. 
 My mom got me a fresca when she hit me with her car once. 
 I got this one when I was 18. 
It was my very first tat. 
 Okay, stop! 
This was a bad idea. 
Let's get out of here. 
 I told you before. 
I'm on the phone! 
Sit down, shut up, don't be rude. 
 I'm only sitting down because look. 
She has her hand on a gun that's strapped under the counter. 
She is dying to plug us. 
 Max, what are you talking about? 
Why is this a bad idea? 
 I don't want you sacrificing your precious rings, frodo. 
Because if the business doesn't work out, It'll be my fault you have nothing. 
And call me selfish, The only life I wanna ruin is my own. 
 Max, the business will go up and down. 
That's natural. 
But this ring is about more than the day to day of the business. 
It's about us... 
And our future together. 
 Yo, did you just ask me to marry you? 
 You could do worse. 
 Now, ladies, gold. 
Now. 
 Come on. 
It's only one ring. 
And when it comes to us, I'm in this for the long haul. 
 Or until this lady shoots us. 
 Hi, I'm here to  come on! Let's go. 
Don't push me I'm out of nicorette. 
 Well, you're all business, aren't you? 
I can respect that. 
I'd like to exchange a tat ring. 
 I've never heard of a tat ring. 
 Thomas aristotle thomas? 
World-famous designer? 
 Yeah, talk down to me. 
That'll make the price better. 
All right, I'll weight it. 
 What's that smell? 
Is someone making soup in the back? 
 None of your business. 
I will give you $275. 
 It's worth $2,500. 
 Where? In 2005? 
 You're just taking advantage of people Because the world economy is crashing. 
 It's called cash for gold, not sympathy for flat chicks. 
 You know what? 
This is inappropriate. 
All right, I'd like to see your business license. 
Maybe I'll make a call to the chamber of commerce. 
 Oh, you will, huh? 
 Duck! Here comes the gun! 
 Maybe I'll make a call to my boys in the back. 
Sal! Richard! 
 Oh, hello. 
Let's get out of here. 
 Are you sure? Because 
I'm kinda feeling richard. 
 Max, I was just in the ladies' room And I had a thought. 
 Why am I doing my lipstick in a mirror that says "die carlos""  I know how to get the full value of the ring. 
We just have to take it to the store where they sell it, And return it. 
 Uh, and why didn't that occur to you before? 
 'cause I don't have the receipt. 
And I bought it three years ago... 
From another store... 
In another country. 
 The customer asked for crust off of a turkey club. 
 Did they say that or is this something you say That they said? 
 They said it. 
But I say I see "screw the bos"" sleeveless tee. 
 I'm sorry, someone call ripley's. 
There is a small mouse speaking. 
 And I bet for sure it comes with stinky armpits. 
 Why don't you see for yourself, ratatouille? 
 I've gotta go. 
Fight's starting. 
 You are stinky. 
So stinky my mother in korea called me and said, "what is that smell?" 
 I am surprised you're upset by man smell. 
Most women like you enjoy it. 
 Yo, max, I got 20 bucks on han. 
He's scrappy. 
 Your english is terrible. 
 My english is less terrible than your terrible english. 
 What? I couldn't understand 
a word you said. 
 What? So sorry I couldn't 
understand a word you said. 
 Excuse me, regular-sized people. 
I am on break until he apologizes. 
 I think the round's over. 
I couldn't understand a word they said. 
 He needs to apologize. 
I'm the boss. 
 Don't let him get to you, han. 
Every woman knows size doesn't matter. 
 I like your shirt. 
Reminds me of the side of the van I lost my virginity in. 
 That little man disrespect me. 
He insult my food, my english, my "hyjane." 
 Is there anything I can do to cheer you up? 
 A hug would help. 
 If I hug you, will you go back to work? 
 Yes. 
 Twosecond hug. 
I'm going in. 
 Aww. 
 How did you do that? 
Your hands never left my back. 
 I am david blaine of zippers. 
 I was trying to cheer you up. 
 You did. 
 Wow, it's so surreal being back here. 
I grew up here. 
It was like camp for me. 
I learned who all the best designers were, How to color coordinate, how to ride a bike. 
 They let you ride a bike here? 
 Bitch, I owned this piece. 
 If there's not an iguana in here, This place is stupid. 
 Oh, my god. 
They are such gorgeous tat rings. 
 Thanks! 
 Hate you! So jealous! 
 Thanks! 
 Bye! 
 Seeing you in your natural habitat is truly disturbing. 
 Hi! Can I help you? 
 Hi! I'd like to return 
a ring I got as a present here. 
 Tat rings are so amazing. 
I can't believe you want to return it. 
 Well, this one's from a guy I'm no longer with, So it's painful to even look at. 
 I understand. 
But I couldn't take it back without a receipt. 
 The thing is he used to hit her. 
 Max! You did not! 
 Caroline, it's not your fault. 
 That's awful. 
I understand why you wouldn't want this ring. 
I'm sure there's something I can do. 
It's not our fault. 
I mean...Your fault. 
 Caroline channing? 
 Jeffrey! 
 Surprised to see me working here? 
Well, I got fired from that other store Whose name I will never mention again After last year's cigarette butt incident. 
 I'm so sorry. 
I had no idea those menthol slim 100s were yours. 
I just thought so many butts on the ground Outside the store was gross, so I said something. 
 Well, that one comment from the great caroline channing About those butts fired my little butt. 
You'd be happy to know that I quite smoking After you got me fired. 
Couldn't afford it. 
I also couldn't afford my gym membership. 
Which is why my fired little butt got massive, Why no one wanted to date me, and why I spent gay pride alone. 
Fortunately, I wound up working here. 
 Yeah, it all worked out. 
Your butt looks tight. 
 It's halfway there. 
 So I got the price on the ring. 
 You're buying a ring? 
A tat ring? 
 Actually, I'm returning. 
 Oh, can I see the receipt? 
As manager of the jewelry department, I couldn't possibly return a ring that you bought At least three years ago without a receipt. 
You wouldn't want me to lose my job again, would you? 
I got this, donna. 
And so sorry to hear about your father being a criminal And you being penniless and all that ugliness. 
But it is kinda karma. 
You are where you are now, and I'm back on top. 
 Look, jeffrey, I know we just met, But there's no way you're a top. 
 Now what are we gonna do? 
 We should hunt down that super fake jealous lady Who hates you. 
Maybe she'll buy one. 
 Max, that's brilliant. 
If anybody's gonna buy a tat ring, They're already in the store. 
We can have a pop-up sale! 
 A popup sale? 
 You don't know what a pop-up sale is? 
 You didn't know what a pilot light was. 
 it's the new trend. 
Mini stores pop up and sell stuff, Then they're gone. 
 That's not a new trend. 
Drug dealers have been doing that for years. 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
 What are you doing, beautiful mind? 
 I'm mentally scanning the layout of the store For security cameras. 
I knew coming here and not going to parks as a child Would pay off. 
Okay, there's only one place we could pull it off Where there are no cameras. 
 Where? 
 Popup sale in the ladies' room. 
That's right, ma'am! 
I said pop-up sale in the ladies' room. 
 I don't do improv. 
So did we sell the ring yet? 
Those women weren't our target customers. 
We're looking for a very specific type. 
Too much style and money to burn. 
  hold the elevator! 
and I love new york! 
Both: Pop-up sale in the ladies' room. 
 I'll take you in two at a time. 
Let me go check with my associate And I'll be right back for adin and lublubah. 
 Such a good memory. 
 Hard to forget such beautiful names. 
Ready? 
 We have a pooper in stall two. 
 Who shops and plops? 
I mean, really. 
 Trust me, I smell the match. 
Classic shop and plop cover-up. 
 Where are the two kit kats we got from the vending machine? 
 I told you I was hungry. 
 Arabic women expect a gift when they buy something. 
 Well, stall number two Will probably supply a little present. 
 Hi, are you here for the pop-up sale? 
 No, I just have to pee. 
 Oh, geez. 
Come on, don't waste my time! 
One stall's open--in and out! 
Running a business! 
 That woman pushed ahead of us. 
Do not sell her my tat ring. 
 It's fun. 
You're here to pick up She's here to drop off. 
Open the shop. 
We're a good team. 
You set 'em up, I knock 'em down. 
 Why is ? 
 I don't know, it just is. 
Are you here for the pop-up sale? 
 A popsale in the bathroom? 
So lame. 
 So lame. 
Caroline? 
 Jen, robin! 
 Oh, my god. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Oh, my god! 
 Oh, my god. 
 Excuse me. 
When will pop-up sale start? 
We have lunch reservations for five at four seasons at 3:00. 
 Why are you asking me? 
 You two are doing pop-up sale, no? 
 No. 
I have nothing to do with this pop-up sale in the bathroom. 
 So lame. 
 So lame. 
 So lame! 
 So lame. 
 Come to lunch with us. 
 Oh, I've already eaten. 
 Our treat. 
 We are not taking no for an answer. 
 They're not taking no for an answer. 
Sell the ring. 
 Where is she going? 
I thought you two were a team. 
 Apparently not. 
 So sorry. 
I got caught up in a hostage nicoise situation. 
How'd it go? 
Did you get full price for the ring? 
 Oh, do you know me? 
Because I couldn't sworn you didn't know me. 
My new friends adin and lablueballs Thought it was weird that you just bailed on me. 
 Max, I panicked in the moment. 
I didn't want those girls telling everyone That caroline channing was in a bathroom selling her jewelry. 
I'm barely back on my feet after the whole scandal. 
I just couldn't bare it. 
 Here. 
I didn't sell them because I didn't buy the whole "in it for the long haul" thing from the beginning. 
And I was right because I'm always right About people in the long haul. 
 Max, I'm talking to you. 
 It's cool. 
We don't need to talk. 
 Max, about the rings, I'm sorry. 
I don't know what else to say. 
 You don't need to say anything. 
You already said a lot of words about the future and us, And then next thing I know, you were "oh, my god!" 
Off to lunch with your friends. 
 Max, I am in this for the long haul. 
Isn't there anything I can say to convince you of that? 
 Nope. 
And it's fine. 
It's not you, it's me. 
I'm the idiot who actually believed for a minute That we had a future. 
But it's okay. 
We'll just keep getting by like we are, for the short haul. 
Cool? 
 Max. 
Hey! 
 Hey. 
What's that smell? 
 I'm making cupcakes. 
 You lit the pilot light? 
 Didn't have to. Look. 
 No way! 
The bluestar in purple? 
What the how did it get How can how could you afford that? 
You sold your tat? 
 Sold them all. 
Spent it on the oven, next-day delivery fee and installation. 
 That woman gave you a better price? 
 No, she pulled a gun on me. 
So I went to every gold store in brooklyn, Leveraged their offers against each other Until I got enough to buy the bluestar. 
 You didn't have to do that. 
 After what I did, there were no more words. 
Only ovens. 
And our future means more to me than rings from my past. 
I told you, I'm in this for the long haul. 
For the record, I hated lunch with those girls. 
I'd rather split a kit kat in a bathroom with you any day. 
 I'm sorry I wasn't listening. 
I was staring at my new boyfriend over there. 
I wanna make out with it! 
Ooh. 
Ow! Hot! 
There's not a ding! 
 There's a ding. 
My rings bought a ding. 
You wanna hug me, don't you? 
 Yeah. 
 But you're not gonna. 
 Yes, I am. 
If you unzip my shirt, I'm gonna be pissed! 
Impressed, but pissed. 
﻿1 So that's three of our delicious homemade cupcakes. 
Nope, can't. 
You touched them. 
Sorry, flu season, no health care. 
You realized I replaced that purell with K.Y., right? 
Max, please say you're kidding. 
Of course, I'm kidding. 
I can't afford lube. 
I just use my tears. 
Max, seriously, don't mess with my hand sanitizer. 
I've already caught poverty this year and I refuse to catch the flu. 
I just have to keep cleaning my hands and not touch anyone. 
Caroline, I have check from table ten. 
Okay, just place it right there. 
 That's a big tip, wow   You know, in Indonesia, you'd be married now. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  2 Broke Girls - S01E17 - And the Kosher Cupcakes I'm gonna get sick, I know it. 
You're fine. 
Fine? Han just unloaded into my mouth. 
Congratulations, you both finally got some action. 
I can't afford to get sick and miss work. 
I need to get some antibiotics. 
You are poor now. 
Poor people don't just run out and buy antibiotics. 
We man up, grow a pair, stare germs in the face. 
Like this French fry from that guy who couldn't stop coughing. 
Max, no, no--oh! 
Mmm. 
Booyah! 
And I haven't ever been sick or to a clinic. 
And, no, planned parenthood doesn't count. 
Well, well, well, she weebles and she wobbles, but she don't fall down. 
Oh, Earl, you're so naughty and nice. 
And I'll be checking you out twice. 
Hey, Sophie, sit anywhere you like. 
Oh, uh, let's see. 
Where is lighting that will make me look most attractive? 
What am I saying? 
I look good everywhere. 
I am meeting man for first time that I met online. 
I wonder if he's here yet. 
Well unless you've been cruising singles who don't leave enough singles, I'd say no. 
You know, Max, if my date turned out to be big bust what, bigger than ours? 
Then you come over and say that something suddenly came up and that I have to go, okay? 
Oh, my gosh, this must be him. 
You must be Sophie Kuchenski. 
I'm Serguisz Bilowski. 
Both: Oh. 
Wow, I love your dress, I love that! 
Something came up and you have to go. 
No, no this is perfect. 
Would you like to sit down? 
Just let me run to the little boys rooms first. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
Who is that? 
That's Sophie's new boyfriend. 
I see, and where's his boyfriend? 
Hello. 
Nice to see you again. 
I'm wearing my velour especially for you. 
And right now, it's the only thing soft about me. 
Please go away before my date comes back from the men's room. 
You have brought other man in here? 
Yes, I met him on Polish dating site. 
On polemeetpole.com 
you didn't have to go online. 
You could meet my pole any time. 
No, this will never happen. 
You're not my type. 
Well, what is your type? 
Wow, they have those automatic hand dryers that blow you. 
I love being blown like that. 
Those look like two giant orange traffic cones. 
Are you trying to tell me not to park there? 
This is a lady. 
Show her some respect. 
Sophie has new man in her life. 
I am so mad I cannot see straight. 
Well, I'm looking right at him and I don't see straight either. 
Max, I think I'm running a slight fever. 
Feel my forehead. 
Look, you should have learned by now-- I don't feel anything. 
Caroline, I've written down address of drug store in South Williamsburg that has a doctor on site. 
Here, I will pay for it. 
Unless it is cancer. 
Then I'm out. 
And, Max, here is check for table seven. 
Booyah! 
How long is it gonna take to see a doctor? 
I'm definitely getting something-- I'm pre-sick. 
I'm stage one pre-sick. 
I need penicillin. 
I told you before, you have to man up and not give in to this sick stuff. 
I'm not like you. 
I have actual things I feel. 
Menachem Goldman. 
Menachem Goldman. 
This must be the orthodox Jewish neighborhood. 
Either that or we're in ZZ Top-ville. 
Max, have some respect. 
Hey, I got nothing but respect. 
They basically invented southern rock. 
I love the Jewish people. 
Whenever I felt sick before, I'd just pop over to the townhouse next door and visit Dr. Klein. 
So your love was contingent on pills? 
We're not that different. 
Actually, the Kleins and I were very close. 
I was invited to many a passover in their home. 
In fact, they called me their honorary Jew. 
Rivka Shemshelewitz. 
Rivka Shemshelewitz. 
Well, you're no Rivka Shemshelewitz. 
Mrs. Klein always said 
I had a bissel Jew. 
You had a Jewish vacuum cleaner? 
No. 
Bissel. 
It's a Yiddish word. 
It means little. 
And this one time I had a bissel flu and she brought me chicken soup every day. 
So why don't you just give Dr. Klein a call? 
I did three times and no return. 
I guess he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore because of my father's financial scandal. 
All those years I thought we were family. 
Guess not. 
I don't know, ignoring your needs and pretending you don't exist? 
Sounds like family to me. 
Caroline Channing, Caroline Channing. 
Finally. 
Let me do the talking. 
I learned a lot of Hebrew from Mrs. Klein. 
These are my people. 
Hello, shalom. 
Very good, you wanna squeeze in a couple more before sundown? 
Wow, you're as bad as me trying to be Irish at the blarney rose for a free beer. 
Yar, can I get me a cerveza? 
What can I get you ladies, besides skirts that are more appropriate? 
Sorry, I didn't know it was an orthodox neighborhood. 
You know what, we could just tie our coats around our waists. 
Max? 
Oh, and look at the breasts on this one. 
Coat on or off? 
Make up your mind. 
No, Bubala, I'm just saying, with those big breasts and that gorgeous hair it's like looking in a mirror. 
It's been a few years, but trust me, under this wig and smock, spitting image of you. 
Here you go, Esther Rachael. 
How else do you think I landed a handsome doctor like my Anshell? 
   Oh, doctor? 
Doctor? 
Doctor, if you could oh, oh, what is that Hebrew word for wait? 
You might wanna start peppering in some English. 
Now, Chava? 
Now you're telling me you're too sick to bake. 
I need 80 cupcakes. 
The bar mitzvah is tomorrow. 
You're dead to me! 
See you next week. 
 We could help. 
 We can? 
Yeah, give me the card. 
Hi, I'm Max and my friend and I here have a cupcake business and we'd be happy to bake as many cupcakes as you need for the bar mitzvah. 
I mean, you need cake, we make cake. 
It's bashert. 
Look, enough with the "it's a small Hebrew world after all." 
How does 250 sound? 
No way, 275. 
I have to bake all morning. 
It's like looking in a mirror. 
They're kosher, right? 
Are they kosher? Look at me. 
Like looking in a mirror. 
Good, I'll call you with the address. 
Esther Rachael, if I could talk to you husband about getting some antibiotics sorry, sundown. 
Okay, I've got the kosher cookbook, salt, flour, sugar, new mixing bowls, and I stopped at the goodwill and got us two appropriately sad schmatas to wear for tomorrow. 
Let's start. 
Start? 
I'm already half done. 
How could you be half done? 
You didn't have any kosher ingredients. 
Oh, they'll never know, we'll just tell them they're kosher. 
Oh, my God, we can't do that. 
Oh, my God, we just did. 
They have to be kosher. 
Do you want God to smite us? 
What's he gonna do? 
Take away all my good luck and your fortune? 
You think all those things labeled low fat are low fat? 
It is just a sales gimmick. 
I had a low cal ice cream bar once that popped my top Jean button. 
Kosher isn't a sales gimmick. 
It's thousands of years of tradition. 
We have to respect that. 
I don't respect anyone's tradition. 
That's kind of my tradition. 
Well maybe that's because you didn't grow up around a family. 
Hey, I grew up with a lot of families. 
The Manson family, the Jackson family, the Menendezes. 
Wait, is that Menendezes or Menen-di? 
Either way, they were like brothers to me. 
Max, we are doing these straight up kosher. 
Fine. 
But return those new bowls, I don't need them. 
I can just dump the bacon bits out of this old one. 
Max, please, let's just start the cupcakes over, drop them off, get me some antibiotics, come home, and put me to bed. 
All right, I'll make them kosher. 
I mean, it's the least you could do after you lied to that woman and let her think you were one of them. 
Hey, I don't know who my father is. 
I could be half Jewish. 
Although it's more likely I'm half bartender who demanded my mom figure out a way to pay her tab. 
 Hey! 
 Hello. 
Serguisz and I are on way up to my apartment. 
He's making me brunch. 
Cornish hens splashed with my special sauce. 
I love special sauce, I love that! 
Yeah, and I stopped by because I was hoping you girls might have some spare cupcakes for dessert. 
Only about 40 of them. 
Oh, good! 
I'll go up and get started. 
Sophie, can I have you keys? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Cute place. 
Ah, I have keychain just like this. 
We are birds of a feather. 
I love that! 
See, girls. 
This is what I like about my new boyfriend. 
He loves so many things. 
And vagina ain't one of them. 
Max! 
We don't know that. 
Sexuality is more fluid these days. 
It's okay. 
He's big, big gay. 
So... You know he's gay? 
Oh, know it? 
I prefer it. 
Yeah, my ex-husband was large male bully. 
Yeah, all rough sex and stains in shorts. 
Now all I want is a man who will spoon me and stay soft. 
But what about sex? 
Oh, no one does me better than me. 
That's the last of them. 
Look at us. 
I think we look very nice. 
Really? 
I think we look like the Olson twins. 
Well hello, girls. 
You look very lovely. 
Mazel tov to the family. 
What a mitzvah to be part of this day. 
How bashert. 
Oh, we're still on that ride? 
I'm sorry. 
It's just, I'm so happy to be in your warm and wonderful home. 
I was very close to my neighbors, the Kleins. 
In fact, they called me their honorary Jew. 
Stop now. 
This is like when you tell Earl you're practically black. 
We'll just get our money and go. 
Take our money and go? 
What are we, barbarians? 
Stay and celebrate a little. 
But, out here in the kitchen, away from the men. 
Sit, eat, come. 
Three of my favorite things to do. 
Good looks and funny. 
What a catch. 
Hadassa, hand me a spoon. 
All 100% kosher and so gorgeous you could plotz. 
This one's seen some Streisand movies, yes? 
Wait until you taste my kugel. 
Oh, I love kugel. 
Tell me, Esther Rachael, are you ashkenzi or sephardic Jews? 
Someone's been on the Internet. 
No way, this is a pasta and a dessert? 
Ooh, there he is. 
My only son. 
My little angel. 
The bar mitzvah boy who, today, becomes a man. 
Girls, this is Shmuley and his friend from next door, David. 
Say hello to the girls who made the cupcakes, boys. 
Both: Nice to meet you. 
Hadassa, Devorah, enough. 
Thank you, go. 
Enjoy the party. 
Have more kugel. 
I'll go ask my husband for your money. 
See, this is what I love, Max. 
The family, the tradition. 
The lasagna with the crazy raisins. 
And those two little boys, could they have been more precious? 
Yo, yo, yo, what up cupcake bitches? 
I'm fixin' to marry me a beeyatch who bakes like this, son. 
Uh, I don't know what's going on, but I'm pretty sure boys and girls aren't supposed to be socializing, right? 
Damn, sweetness, your lips are moving but your ass is doing all the talking. 
Uh... Is that Yiddish? 
Oh, boys, there you are, come on. 
Say goodbye to the cupcake ladies. 
Both: Nice to meet you. 
Did that just happen or has my fever suddenly spiked? 
That's the first time I ever saw anyone acting all pimp who still had pimples. 
Yo, yo, yo! 
And they're back. 
What up, Shawties? 
What's crackalackin? 
Yo, today my boy became a mans. 
That's right. 
Got my bar mitzvah done, son. 
Preach! 
So let's get to it. 
How much of my mitzvah money is it gonna take for you to pop that top and serve me up some super fine taytays? 
Dude, there is not enough money in the how much are we talking? 
Max! 
Yo, don't get all jealous, vanilla cone. 
How about you turn around and make it pop for daddy? 
How would you like it if I told your mother right on the other side of that door how you boys were in here disrespecting us? 
How is you gonna say anything with your mouth full? 
Damn, son! 
Come in here, ma. 
This way. 
Don't say anything to her. 
Let's just get our money and get out of here. 
Max, she should know. 
You wanna ruin their day and not get paid? 
Just keep it to yourself for five minutes and we're gone. 
I want you to meet my mother, Hinda Fagel. 
Ma, this is Max who made the kosher cupcakes. 
And I'm Caroline. 
What did the shicksa say? 
She said her name is Caroline. 
Who cares what her name is? 
She looks like the people that stole my grandmother's good hutch. 
But look at this one. 
It's like looking in a mirror. 
Oy, she's got a fever. 
Oh, Max, oh honey, you're burning up. 
Oh, no way, I don't get sick. 
I get sick. 
You're sick. 
You'll come, you'll lie down. 
Oh, I'm really fine. 
We'll just get our money and head home. 
Nonsense. 
You'll see my husband. 
The doctor. 
Stop, wait, where are you taking her? 
I'm the one who gets sick. 
What did she say? 
She says she wants your hutch. 
You poor baby. 
You have a fever of 102. 
Just have to rest, Bubala. 
I'm really fine. 
That towel thing feels awesome. 
It's a cold compress, it'll bring your fever down. 
My husband should be in any minute. 
Thanks. 
I think it's only right to tell you, I don't know a lot about my background, so... 
I might not be Jewish. 
Please, look at you. 
You could be my daughter. 
I would have liked that. 
Always wanted a daughter. 
I always wanted a mother. 
Oh, did your mother die young? 
Sadly, no. 
Ooh, you need a kiss. 
Oh, good your soup is ready. 
Ess a bissel, tatelleh. 
Bissel? 
I know bissel. 
Of course you do. 
You're Jewish. 
Okay, I'm Jewish, what the hell. 
Oh, we don't believe in hell. 
We don't? 
Awesome. 
Oh, thanks. 
Call me Bubby. 
Thanks, Bubby. 
No one's ever blown on my soup before. 
What's wrong with them? 
 That's my boy, that's my boy, hey, ho  Oh, there he go! 
That's what's up, hooker. 
First of all, you just scuffed his mother's freshly-waxed floor and secondly, you may think throwing away your family traditions is cool now, but in life, bad things can happen. 
And one day, when you find yourself penniless and sick, you'll need your nice Jewish family and you'll call them three times and they won't answer the phone no matter how much you need antibiotics. 
Damn, boo, I stopped listening after you said freshly-waxed. 
Playa! 
Max, I'm giving you some amoxicillin for you to take home. 
Now take it all, even when you start feeling better. 
Yes, Dr. Anshell. 
Look what I brought. 
Sweets for the sweets. 
Ooh. 
Uh, wait, wait, wait, before you eat those, remember how I said I might not be Jewish? 
 Yes. 
 Those might not be kosher. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying they're not kosher. 
What is she saying? 
Not kosher! 
 What? 
 Not kosher! 
Spit it out, ma! 
Spit it out! 
Just a minute, it tastes so good. 
 You like that? 
 Stop. 
 You like that? 
 Stop it. 
 You like that? 
 Sthat's it! 
Listen, hit me with one more dead president and you'll be six feet under with Biggie and Tupac. 
You understand me, Jew-Tang Clan? 
Skinny bitch came to play! 
What kind of girl brings non-kosher cupcakes into a kosher home? 
Not me-- I'm not that kind of girl. 
Yeah, hi, I think I'm that kind of girl. 
Max, what are you talking about? 
I made sure every single one of those was up to a rabbi's high standard. 
Yes, well, maybe my rabbi didn't have such high standards. 
I'm so sorry, I burned some and we were running late and I figured, four non-kosher out of 80. 
So close. 
Max, I told you how important all those traditions are to a Jewish family. 
Yes, you told me about tradition and family, but none of that meant anything until I felt that cold compress. 
And she was nice enough to put it on my head and I felt what that feels like. 
And then Bubby blew on my soup before she ate the non-kosher cupcake. 
Wait, Bubby ate a non-kosher cupcake? 
It's a shanda! 
It is a shanda. 
I'm hoping shanda means you're forgiven and we'll pay you anyway. 
We are not taking any money. 
That's right, you're not taking anything. 
Except for this compress. 
Feel better. 
Now go, get out of my sight. 
And don't wear short skirts. 
Esther Rachel, I wanna talk to you about your son Shmuley's behavior today. 
What are you talking about? 
What did my Shmuley do? 
I'll tell you what he did. 
He became a man. 
That's all he did. 
Right, Caroline? 
I'll say he became a man. 
What are you talking about? 
Shmuley! 
Stay out of it, this is not our family. 
You and I don't have a family. 
They still do. 
Let the police tell her about him. 
So about my Shmuley. 
What do you have to say? 
Mazel tov, he's a wonderful, wonderful boy. 
Oh, there you are. 
Shmuley, David, say goodbye to the cupcake girls. 
Both: Nice to meet you. 
Thank you. 
So I see no Max. 
She still out sick? 
It's her first night back. 
She should be here any minute. 
Did you wanna order something or wait for your boyfriend? 
Oh, see, this is sad story. 
Uh, he broke off with me to date other woman. 
And she had penis. 
Yeah, I can't compete with that. 
Hi, Earl. 
There she is, my long lost love. 
How you feeling, Max? 
I'm pretty good. 
Hey, Bubby. 
I brought you some chicken soup for taking care of me the last couple days. 
I enjoyed being your Bubby. 
I guess you were wrong, Max. 
You and I do have family each other. 
We're not family until we have to testify against each other in a manslaughter trial. 
Here, eat this. 
I don't want you to catch what I just had. 
Not gonna happen, Max. 
I took your advice. 
I manned up. 
I stared germs in the face. 
That's right, when you got sick, I got balls. 
Booyah! 
Like looking in a mirror. 
Max. 
Do you have any gum? 
My breath tastes like someone else's breath. 
You're asking me if I have any gum? 
That's like asking New Jersey if it has any sluts. 
Great. There were onions 
in my street meat. 
Listen to me. 
"Onions in my street meat." 
Last year, I was taking meetings on wall street. 
This year, I'm eating meat from the street by a wall. 
Let's see. 
Phone, chapstick. 
A pill! Could be birth control, 
could be ecstasy. 
Waiting for a day off to find out. 
Why wait? 
If I start touching your hair in an hour, don't let me have sex with anyone. 
Max! 
Max, what's this? 
It's addressed to Max's homemade cupcakes. 
Really? I thought 
that was just a thing I wrote the new pizza place info on. 
It's a $200 check from that office party we did. 
Max's homemade cupcakes in type! 
No way, I've never been typed out before! 
I've been cash, I've sweaty 20s pushed into my palm, but I've never been typed! 
We's all grown up! 
We's legit! 
Listen up, diner! 
I just hit the big time. 
No more serving up slop to you lowlifes. 
So everybody can suck it! 
My waitress days are over. 
Can I get some more coffee? 
Sure. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Earl, what are you doing? 
Employees are not allowed to drink diner liquor. 
Now, hold up, Han. 
It's April 16th. 
Do you know what day tomorrow is? 
Oh, of course. 
Happy Martin Luther King day. 
Enjoy a drink on me. 
It's not Martin Luther King day. 
Black people are allowed to be excited about other days too, you know. 
Is there a new Tyler Perry movie coming out? 
No, Kim Jong Il. 
It's tax day. 
And I always treat myself to a Brandy when I do my taxes because I need to be drunk when I see that refund amount. 
Chicken breast, side of hot sauce. 
Breast? Hot sauce? 
Come on, it's right there. 
Max, now that I have big love for Sophie, I no longer say inappropriate sexual things to other women. 
I save all my hot sauce for her breasts. 
Love has made you a real old lady. 
Here you go, Brandy man. 
Enjoy. 
Max, you got a stamp? 
I wanna drop this off in the mail on my way home. 
I have one in my purse. 
I'll just get it. 
Max, he wants to file this year. 
He doesn't have time for the search party to go into your purse and return. 
Hey, it's a purse. 
It's supposed to be messy. 
No, it's supposed to be a purse, not a retirement home for a pair of panties stuck to old lifesavers. 
I'm kinda off my meal now. 
I have a stamp right here, Earl. 
There, see? 
Order versus chaos. 
Also known as OCD versus "Oh, here's a CD I forgot I had." 
Would you prefer a flower, flag, or a love stamp? 
Ladies, I don't care which, I just wanna get these taxes in the mail before the deadline. 
 Earl, you do your own taxes? 
 I surely do. 
Proud to say I haven't missed a year since 1950 when I had my first job as Frank Sinatra's ball boy. 
Ball boy? 
Was he a good tennis player? 
No, darling, he didn't play tennis. 
The job was washing his balls. 
And that was good work for those times. 
Do you mind if I look over your 1040 to see if I can increase your return? 
Do you, Wharton, do you. 
Well, at first glance, I see you short-changed yourself on some deductions. 
There's 500 right there. 
Why don't you sign this now, and I'll save you what I can and then drop it in the mail tomorrow? 
Max, look at this. 
Blonde ambition here just saved me $500. 
Really? That's pretty cool. 
Oh! There's another 100. 
 No way, that's awesome. 
 Ding, ding, ding. 
It's like I won the slots without being surrounded by those pissed off ladies with emphysema. 
How could you not know there was a cupcake check in your purse? 
It just got mixed in. 
And anyway, who still sends important stuff through the mail these days? 
What are we, pioneers? 
No, we're businesswomen, and we need to keep track of every penny. 
Hey, should we frame it and hang it on the wall? 
That way when we're two billionaire bitches who hate each other's guts, we can look at the check and remember. 
Max, I'll never hate your guts. 
You don't know. 
Business pressure, you caught me sleeping with your husband, anger about your bad facelift. 
Oh, honey, I will never have a bad facelift. 
I've been collecting names of good doctors since I was 11, and I was terrified by my piano teacher whose nose was suddenly here. 
That's pretty cool of you to do Earl's taxes for him. 
I'm happy to. 
After all, finance is my field of expertise. 
Yeah, pretty cool. 
You know, all that stuff. 
Helpful hints and whatnot. 
Cripes! What more 
do I have to do, Rouge my boobs and stand in a storefront window in Amsterdam? 
Are you gonna help me with my taxes or not? 
Max, I don't know if it's a good idea. 
I've seen your purse. 
I can only imagine your taxes. 
Can you let go of the purse? 
It's just a messy bag. 
It's not like I lost your child in the outback. 
It's symptomatic. 
Here, look at my purse. 
You know what, never mind. 
It's too late for a purse smackdown. 
But for the record, even if you win now, my purse will kick your purse's ass. 
Later, after it spent two weeks learning your purse's schedule. 
Organized, clean, perfect. 
Look. 
Just look at it. 
Look at it, Max. 
It won't bite. 
Who are you, my mother's third boyfriend? 
And truthfully, before I saw that check, I wasn't even going to file. 
But now that our business is getting real, maybe I should start getting real about my finances. 
I mean, when we are two billionaire bitches, I don't want the government to swoop in and Wesley snipe us for back taxes. 
Okay, great. 
We'll do it tomorrow. 
And I promise, no more purse slams starting now. 
Who is that? 
CNN. They found a 34th Chilean 
miner in your purse. 
Okay, okay! 
Starting now. 
 Who is it? 
 Kim Kardashian. 
No. 
I'm not Kim Kardashian. 
No, I work for a living. 
Hey, Sophie, you come down for your cupcake nightcap? 
Yeah, thank you, Max. 
But tonight I'm going to take two. 
'Cause I'm getting ready to date and I wanna get back to my fighting weight. 
Sophie, what do you mean you're getting ready to date again? 
Oh, well, there's some really cute new guys down at the Polish club. 
And... oh, my gosh, 
one in particular is like a cross between Vin Diesel and Viggo Mortensen. 
Yeah, so rich and handsome you almost don't notice the wheelchair. 
Hard to resist a man in New York who's got his own ride. 
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry. 
Oh, then don't. 
It's just what about you and Oleg? 
He thinks you two are a couple. 
A couple? 
No, this is crazy talk. 
I mean, yes, we have had some hot, dirty sex in a few kitchens and toilets, and... 
On the floor of a sandwich shop in the subway. 
Plus twice we did it like dogs on the hallway stairs and on every smooth surface in my apartment. 
But I mean, come on. 
I mean, that's it. 
I'm a lady. 
Sophie, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but for Oleg, it's not just about sex. 
He feels things for you. 
I know for a fact he's buying you a special gift. 
Tell her, Max. 
Well, he mentioned something about a fur, and tonight when he was talking about you he did use the word "love." 
Love? 
Come on, don't ruin my cupcake buzz. 
I mean, this man has no future. 
Of course, he does have a giant penis. 
But no future. 
I mean, I've worked hard to get where I am. 
I need a man who has a dream and a drive. 
And I can buy a big giant penis online for $47. 
Really? 
Add to cart. 
Well, then you have to tell him you're not interested in going any further. 
Oh, all right, don't worry. 
I will. 
Yeah, I mean, I need this man in my life like I need breast implants. 
Which is like... 
Not at all, right? 
Here's another W-2, H&R blonde. 
Thank you. 
Max, you worked at a Mexican restaurant in long island city? 
Oh, my God, don't be so judgmental. 
Mira, look! 
I just found a receipt for shoe insoles and double-stick tape. 
Work expense. 
Again, senorita, not a write-off. 
Like when you asked if you could claim your pot dealer as an entertainment expense. 
So I was wrong. 
We've all got our talents. 
You're great at doing paperwork, and I'm great at baking and finding places to have sex at carnivals. 
Just add that to the pile I'm calling "evidence for your future audit." 
Not there, that's Earl's tax return. 
Can I see a copy of what you filed last year? 
Ugh... I didn't file 
last year. 
Or the year before or any year ever. 
Wait, you've never paid your taxes? 
No, I've never filed my taxes. 
I've paid taxes. 
I see it on my check. 
$8 to the state, 15 in federal income, 6.23 to Fica, 
whoever that lucky bitch is. 
Max, why didn't you tell me the severity of this last night? 
Um, maybe you haven't noticed, but I have issues around money. 
Every year, I say I'm going to file, and then I put it off and put it off until the day it's due, like today, and then I sit down with a 1040 and my W-2s, and right around the fourth question, I'm like, screw it! 
I'm gonna watch old soul train clips on YouTube before work. 
And then I feel like a loser until tax day is over. 
And then I'm like, who cares? I'm awesome. 
I'll do them next year. 
So what you're telling me is your finances are as messy as your purse. 
Careful now! 
Starting to get a little hot up in here. 
Fine, I don't care. 
I just want you to get your taxes done. 
Now throw away all of your useless garbage into this trash can. 
You know what, I'm just gonna go to that pop-up tax place near the diner. 
And I'll throw my "useless garbage" in the dumpster on the way out. 
Wait, you're gonna spend like $100 to have someone do your taxes when I'm sitting right here. 
The amount of money I'll spend down there is nothing compared to the amount of money I'd have to spend on weed to survive doing taxes with you. 
 Good afternoon, girls. 
 Hello. 
I hope Sophie and I's wild lovemaking didn't keep you up all night. 
We wanted to come down and show you the gift I just gave Sophie. 
Yeah, look, girls. 
Look at my gift. 
It's got a leg. 
Wow, I didn't think you two were the couple type. 
We are going into Manhattan for fruit cocktail and champagne. 
 Want to join? 
 Hell, yeah! 
No, Max, you're doing your taxes. 
Oh. My mother says 
I can't come out. 
Have fun. 
This means nothing! 
I can't believe you're putting your financial future into the hands of a hipster tax place called "The Tax of Life." 
You know how the old proverb goes. 
"You take the good, you take the bad. 
You take what's left, and there you have the tax of life." 
43! Number 43. 
And remember, if you need any help, I'm acquainted with your finances. 
And I'm acquainted with your attitude. 
Don't say a word. 
 I'm 43. 
 'Sup, 43? 
I'm Kyle. 
I'm your tax bro. 
Hi, I'm Max and this is my mute friend Caroline. 
I already started to fill out the 1040 and I have my W-2s from this year. 
Also some receipts. 
Well, let's get started! 
Do you have a health savings account? 
 Definitely not. 
 Oh, well, we can fudge that. 
 I'll put you down for 500. 
 Sounds good. 
Fudge that? Fudge? 
I wasn't aware there was fudging in finance. 
Domestic production activities. 
 Like condoms and stuff? 
 I guess. 
Talk about adjusted gross income, am I right? 
Am I right? 
Kyle, put me down for 250. 
250. 
Should I just put the cheese plate out for the IRS now? 
What about residential energy credits? 
I bought some of those curly light bulbs once. 
Oh, that's another 150 easily. 
Sorry, Max, I can't stop myself. 
Money, finances... 
this is my thing. 
If we were at a copper-plated jewelry sale, I'd let you take the wheel. 
I can't sit back and watch you risk our financial future. 
You'll be dragging me into this with you and your tax bro. 
Excuse me, tax bro. 
Oh, my God, you wanna claim a residential energy credit? 
You don't even have a 5695 up here. 
Hey, your mute friend's all over this. 
You should let her do your taxes. 
She's way better. 
No, that's cool, Kyle. 
I'm not gonna do this. 
One more year won't kill me. 
I'll just spend this money on pot. 
That's an entertainment expense, bee-tee-Dubbs. 
Max, don't give up yet. 
Let me help. 
Look, it's already 9:00. 
We ran out of time. 
At least take a form and file an extension. 
The post office is open till midnight. 
Max, you know you wanna change your finances. 
It's a step. 
You're right. 
Good idea. 
They have extension forms at the post office. 
We can pick one up when I drop off Earl's return. 
 What? 
 It's not here. 
It's not in my purse. 
Last time I saw it, it was on the coffee table before you came in with all your tax stuff. 
It must still be there. 
Uh, no, you made me throw all that stuff out. 
You threw out a 75-year-old man's tax return? 
You threw some papers out too. 
This is so not like me. 
The only thing I've ever lost is my virginity. 
What are we gonna do? 
No, it's okay. Relax. 
No big deal. 
We just have to go home and climb through the dumpster. 
No, seriously, what are we gonna do? 
Ready? 
No, seriously, what are we gonna do? 
Well, let's get to it. 
My garbage ain't gonna find itself. 
Max, I can't. 
If I go in there, I will literally be white trash. 
Look, you're the one who had to butt in and get all "Wharton" with Earl. 
If you had left him alone, it would be at the post office safe and sound. 
Fine. 
But to be clear, if we find a baby in there, you're raising it on your own. 
Hey, it's already off to a better start than I had. 
There's food everywhere. 
Oh, hell, no! 
It's Tuesday... trash pick up! 
Better get in and out or we'll be on a garbage barge to coney island. 
Come on, I'll give you ten fingers. 
My shoes. 
My dignity. 
My shoes. 
My hands are touching a dumpster. 
All right, on the count of three, I'll push, you hoist yourself up. 
But really pull yourself up, or you won't make it. 
It's hell. 
I'm looking into hell. 
1...2...3! 
Whaa! 
I wanted to scream, but it wouldn't come out. 
Okay, well, good luck. 
See ya. 
 Max! 
 I'm kidding! 
I'm coming around the back. 
I found a place to get a leg up. 
Now? 
You just saw that now? 
Aah! 
Why'd you scream? 
You knew it was me. 
That's the one I couldn't get out before. 
Oh, God, look at this mess. 
It's like looking for a dirty needle in a haystack, which I've done. 
Okay, start poking around. 
Look for familiar garbage. 
"Familiar garbage"? 
I hate it in here. 
I wanna die. 
It's not that bad. 
My mom and I once spent five hours in a dumpster looking for proof that her boyfriend was cheating on her, and all we found was a scratch-off worth a $1.50 
and a beach towel. 
And then, we used that $1.50 
to take the towel to the laundromat. 
12 years later, you and I use that very towel to dry ourselves off after a shower. 
Well, I'm standing on a stranger's cold sesame noodles with egg shells stuck to my ankles. 
You win, Max. 
What does that have to do with me? 
It means I'm officially standing in your purse. 
How about more real garbage, less Caroline garbage? 
Caroline garbage? 
You have been dumping on me all day. 
Me? What have I done? 
"Max, you didn't file...ever?" 
I didn't say it like that. 
And you didn't file ever. 
Is that my fault? 
Yes! This is all your fault. 
Before I met you, I didn't even think about a future. 
Now I have a future, and I'm standing in a dumpster! 
You are not the only one standing in a dumpster. 
And... get a new purse. 
If you had been able to find a stupid stamp in that horrid thing, I would've never even seen Earl's taxes and I wouldn't be standing in a dumpster. 
Max, no, no, no! 
I will never, ever recover from that! 
Red bulls? Red bulls? 
Are those our red bulls? 
Where? 
Yes! Yes! 
That's my garbage! 
That's my garbage! 
Get over here! 
If we find it, we'll have enough time to shower and get to the post office. 
Earl's taxes! 
Earl's taxes! 
Next! 
This is unbelievable. 
Everyone trying to get their taxes filed by midnight. 
Wow, I haven't seen this much last-minute licking since the cops raided that Thai massage parlor. 
 I'll grab an extension form. 
 You get in line. 
The line's longer than I expected. 
No, we have to file. 
She's nursing. 
Don't worry. 
We're fine. 
I'm a bum. 
She's got a baby hanging off her nipple and her taxes are done. 
Max, you can't compare yourself to other people. 
You'll do it your way. 
And there's a blind guy. 
No eyes, taxes done. 
I guess he wasn't distracted by YouTube clips. 
Don't be so hard on yourself. 
You're filing an extension, and then you'll get them done. 
You say I'm going to file, but will I? 
I say I'm going to clean out my purse, but do I? 
Sophie says she's gonna tell Oleg, but did she? 
An extension is just another excuse for me to put it off and create a bigger mess. 
Hey, Max. 
What's up? 
Bob. 
Wow, what are you doing here? 
Oh, I just filed my taxes like everyone else. 
Bob had a good year. 
Ha. 
Who was that? 
My dealer. 
Forget the extension. 
If my pot dealer can file, I can file. 
We still have half an hour. 
Run home and get my W-2s while I stay in line and fill out the 1040. 
Maybe I should stay and fill it out, and you can run home. 
No, I have to do this. 
Don't worry, if I get stumped, I'm surrounded by procrastinators. 
One of them will help... 
Eventually. 
Okay, here's a pen. 
I'm gonna go drop off Earl's return in the slot, and I'll be back as soon as I can. 
Okay. 
Uh, hi, can you hold my place while I get a tax form for this year? 
Oh, cutting it close. 
You're worse than me. 
 Go, I got your back. 
 And she's got your front. 
So I add up all these lines and put the total here? 
 Right. 
 What about student loans? 
Yes, and I paid mine off this year. 
Then claim it. 
That interest is a huge write off. 
Put down $436 on line 33. 
 Post office is closing! 
 No! 
My friend just texted me. 
She's almost here. 
Please, I have to file this year. 
Midnight is midnight! 
Boo! 
Oh, please, I have six children at home. 
This is nothing. 
Here! I'm here, I'm here! 
What time is it? 
30 seconds. 
Make room, make room. 
Stapler, stapler. 
 10... 
 Sign it! Sign your 1040! 
 9... 
 Where? 
8...7... 
6... 
Fold! Fold, you bastard! 
5...4... 
3... 
2... 
No stamp. 
 What? 
 Aw! 
It's cool. 
I got ya, boo. 
I did it! 
I filed my taxes! 
Everybody can suck it! 
Max, look out, you're so tired you're spilling batter all over yourself. 
Ugh. 
I knew it was only a matter of time before I became a battered woman. 
This is a huge disappointment. 
I heard that. 
You don't even know what I'm referring to. 
Oh, I just assumed we were talking about everything. 
I'm referring to our expensive new cupcake website. 
Not one job offer. 
You want a website that will make you feel better about yourself? 
Go to models-falling-down.com 
number one: Klum goes boom. 
It's 3:00 A.M. 
Who would be coming over now? 
I don't know, my dealer, my other dealer? 
That guy who always asks if I know where my dealer is? 
 Who is it? 
 You can't handle what's on the other side of that door. 
Yesterday, I saw a guy on a stoop frenching his cat. 
I can handle anything. 
Oleg, what are you doing here? 
And you put the, "oh, no," in kimono. 
Your upstairs neighbor Sophie is allowing me to have sex with her. 
And I came down to borrow some sensual oils. 
Preferably, ones that you can eat. 
How did you get out of apartment? 
You know the rules. 
I came down to borrow sensual oils. 
Yeah, but no peppermint. 
It makes his tongue swell. 
And let's face it, his tongue is the best part about him. 
You're right, I can't handle that. 
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET 
Those nice smelling men in booth two just asked me if I was on the down-low. 
What does this mean? 
Uh, brother, I'm gonna need a little more context. 
They said, "are you on the down-low, because we have a friend who is a big-time rice queen." 
Again, coming up dry. 
Rice queen, is it, like, a Korean dairy queen? 
Kind of. 
Here's table seven's check, Earl. 
Max, the guys at booth two just asked Han if was on the down-low. 
They think he's gay. 
That's a step up. 
Usually people think he's a lesbian. 
Here you go, Sophie. 
Uh, Max, Caroline. 
Yeah, about last night, I hope we can keep that just between us girls. 
I'm sure we have all done things in the dark late at night with men that we'd like to forget. 
Why stop at late at night in the dark? 
How about early morning? 
Or a nooner at the port authority bus terminal? 
Oh, good. 
And you too understand, Caroline? 
Actually, no, sorry. 
I haven't ever done anything with a man  that I'm ashamed of. 
 Oh, yeah. 
But your father did steal millions and millions of dollars. 
So... don't forget that. 
Han just sat your favorite gays. 
Max, their names are Steven and Michael. 
And it's not very P.C. To reduce 
people to a stereotype. 
 Hey, girl. 
 What's up, care bear? 
Yeah, they're not stereotypes. 
What would you say if they called you "the big-boob waitress from the wrong side of the tracks who had sex with everyone in high school"? 
I'd say, "that's why I love the gays. 
They get me." 
Come over and say hello. 
They're the first and practically the only people that ever hired us to do a cupcake job. 
Do I have to? 
Can't I just stand here and judge from afar? 
Come on, and let's not mention how bad we're doing. 
We want them to think we're a big success, so they'll recommend us for their friends' events. 
Yeah, because you know the gays, they party about everything. 
And there's another stereotype. 
 Hi, guys. 
 Happy leap year! 
F.Y.I., people 
are still talking about those cupcakes you made for our wedding shower. 
 Everyone. 
 How's business? 
Fabulous, amazing, killing it. 
Or it's killing us. 
We're not quite sure. 
I'll go grab some menus for you girls. 
 Max. 
 Sorry. 
I'll go grab some menus for you ladies. 
Love her... so Madeleine Stowe 
in revenge. 
Oh, she is. 
 I don't watch that. 
 We love it. 
It's all about a young blonde woman who's out to seek revenge on everyone for destroying her family. 
Yeah, too close to home. 
 Max, guess what. 
 Caroline, you're not supposed to tell me I'm on intervention until the actual intervention. 
I just got offered $600 to stay at Steven and Michael's apartment and watch their dogs while they're out of town  for two days. 
 Why would anyone pay $600 to watch dogs for two days? 
Well, because, you know, they want a certain amount of attention to be paid to the... 
Just say it, they're gay and they think their dogs are their children. 
Max, you have to stop doing this. 
I'll stop when they stop. 
This is so exciting. 
It'll be like a paid vacation at an amazing hotel. 
And I need to get as far away from here as possible. 
 Oh, where do they live? 
 Four blocks away. 
Well, have a good time. 
And while you're four blocks away having your vacation, I'll be home maybe taking a little masturbacation. 
What are you talking about? 
I wouldn't go on vacation without you. 
We'll split the dog money to cover the shifts we take off from the diner. 
Well, thanks, but I don't do that thing where you take off work. 
"Hi, I'm Max, I can't go "to a fancy apartment and have fun. 
"I'd rather work in a steel mill and sing Bruce Springsteen songs." 
Max, when was the last time you had a vacation? 
Never. 
Unless you count the summer I hid under the front porch from my mom's new boyfriend. 
We really need to get out of here. 
This is more than just spring break. 
It's a break from the diner, from the cupcake business, from being poor, from everything depressing right now. 
Things aren't that depressing. 
Oh. 
Yeah, well, I'm sure we have all done things with men in kitchens that... 
We are not proud of. 
Spring break is the greatest time ever. 
You just go crazy and do shots and throw all the rules out the window. 
Oh, I've done that. 
But when you're poor, you just call it Tuesday. 
Why are you walking like that? 
This is my spring break walk. 
These shoulders have shimmied like this all the way from Majorca to Ibiza. 
Try it, Max. 
Shake a little. 
 Shake. 
 That's cool. 
I'll just wait till I get the DTS later. 
Maybe I don't have the right key. 
Oh, hi. 
Sorry, I think we might be at the wrong door. 
That's a bummer for the door. 
It's over there, 12d. 
We're house-sitting for a few days. 
Cool, I'm Brendon. 
Hey, Brendon. 
I'm Ashley. 
 And... 
 I'm surprised. 
 And also Max. 
 I'd shake your hands, but I kind of stink. 
I've been at my microbrewery most of the day, so I am sorry if I smell like yeast. 
Hey, that's my apology. 
Whoa, all right, cool. 
Well, I will see you guys around, yeah? 
Yeah, totes. 
You have something you want to tell me, Ashley? 
I never use Caroline channing on vacation for security reasons. 
I was almost abducted at gunpoint for a ransom in Mexico city. 
Wow, gunpoint. 
Were you using the word, "totes" at the time? 
Can you take out the paper that has the alarm code on it? 
Wow, this place is amazing. 
It's, like, the cover of gay gay gay magazine. 
Max, you have to stop reducing them to that gay stereotype. 
Now, read me the security code. 
It's..."Liza." 
A lot of different types of people like Liza Minnelli. 
Oh, look, it's a poodle in a tutu. 
That's not gay, right? 
Lots of... 
Lots of different types of people have a poodle in a tutu... 
Named Barbra Streisand. 
Oh, there's the book of instructions. 
"Hey, girl. 
Hey, care bear. 
"Have fun with Barbra Streisand and Wynonna Judd. 
"Wynonna is a little temperamental "and tends to stay in the bedroom. 
"We didn't have time to purge her anal gland before left. 
Instructions on page two." 
I'm starting to understand the $600. 
"Don't worry, it's easy. 
We do it all the time." 
No wonder Wynonna's so temperamental. 
"Help yourself to anything in the fridge. 
There are portable saunas in the closet." 
Portable saunas? 
Love it, what is it? 
This is so cool. 
I'm hot like I'm at the beach, but I'm not stepping in any used condoms. 
Yeah, these are great. 
My friend Candice travelstead used one to make weight for prom. 
Are you done with that? 
Yeah, switch? 
On spring break, I always loved spending the day at the beach. 
Just the chilling and the girl talk. 
Yeah. 
Tell me again, about the sound the anal gland made when you squeezed it. 
Please, stop. 
I already told you twice. 
And now, wynonna Judd won't even look at me. 
Well, not without her lawyer in the room. 
I'm hungry. 
What do you eat on vacation? 
Anything we want. 
Let's see. 
I bet their refrigerator is stocked with all kinds of pates and cheeses and those parm crisp things. 
By the way, nice suit. 
You look like someone should be pouring a 40 on you in a rap video. 
Thanks. 
There's nothing. 
I mean, come on, what kind of gays are they? 
All anal gland and no cheese. 
I just expected everything to be better. 
You know, champagne on ice, thousand thread-count sheets. 
I mean, the towels... 
They're not even bath sheets. 
Wait, the towels aren't good? 
Because I already stole two. 
They're fine, they're just not what I was expecting. 
What's happening over there? 
You could use a little shoulders. 
You're right, enough, we're on vacay. 
Come on, let's go get dressed and find someplace to eat. 
Are you crazy? 
I am not leaving this thing. 
This is the happiest I've ever been in my life. 
Okay, we'll order in, pretend it's room service. 
They must have a menu drawer here somewhere. 
Plus, we'll never find a restaurant with a portable sauna section. 
"Food network party tonight "to celebrate the release of a cookbook. 
Food and drink provided." 
Free foodie food, free foodie drinks? 
 Yay, let's go. 
 No, I like it in here. 
It's amazing. 
Ashley wants to go. 
Ashley wants to go. 
Fine, but can I bring the dog? 
I've always wanted to be one of those girls who brings a tiny dog to a public place and just looks at everyone, like, "yeah, I have a tiny dog, so what?" 
You can be whoever you want to be. 
You're on vacation. 
I'm gonna go invite Brendon to come. 
You gotta have a crush on spring break. 
Well, I'm sitting in my crush. 
Hey, shouldn't you put something on? 
Uh, it's spring break. 
Aah! 
Barbra, get help. 
Go, Barbra Streisand, go. 
Hey, look at the book title, 306 degrees of heaven: Bacon. 
Heaven bacon. 
That's good wordplay. 
It's okay. 
Not much of a crowd. 
Party's a little disappointing. 
Bacon truffle, Barbra Streisand? 
Mm? 
Yeah, I'm feeding my tiny dog a truffle, so what? 
Miss, miss. 
Excuse me, what are these things for? 
Oh, it holds your drink while you get food. 
 No! 
 Yeah. 
Yeah, these are great when you see them for the first time. 
For me, it was on a yacht in the Mediterranean. 
You know what else these are good for? 
Frees up your shoulders to shimmy. 
You shimmy. 
I'm gonna walk over here and find us a bigger, shinier something to do later. 
Later? 
We're going home  to our amazing apartment. 
 Or not. 
Come on, Max, it's spring break. 
Let's not get tied down. 
I'll be over there. 
Yeah, we'll be over there. 
Oh. 
Hi. You're not allowed 
to have dog in here. 
Unless he wants to buy the book. 
What are you, some kind of foodie bouncer? 
Worse. 
I wrote the book. 
Yeah, nice sleeves. 
You get those in the tattoo gold rush of '09? 
I'm Zeke. 
What's your name? 
I'm Max. 
This is my tiny dog. 
I take her everywhere, so what? 
Hey, Max, you wanna try my thick-cut bacon? 
Maybe. Let's just 
take things slow. 
I'm telling you, it serves the best vegan stew anywhere. 
You really should put it in your blog. 
Oh, if I write one more article about something vegan, all of my devoted 10,000 readers will hold hands and jump collectively out a window. 
And I know you like to find what's new and what's next. 
Chocolate bacon? 
I just need a minute over there. 
Hi, couldn't help but overhear. 
If you're looking for what's new, I found these two adorable girls who run a cupcake business out of their home in Williamsburg. 
I know how that sounds, but trust me, totally fresh and not at all overexposed. 
And you're someone I should listen to because...? 
Sorry, didn't introduce myself. 
Ashley Emerson, style editor for Elle. 
Oh. 
If you're interested, I think I might have a card in here somewhere. 
Was holding on to it for Martha. 
Mr. Bacon action figure. 
A world of bacon sampler. 
And I want to apologize for the food network trucker hat, which has nothing to do with bacon and everything to do with me being a sellout. 
Guess what. 
Ashley just gave our card to a woman who's such a bitch she must be important. 
She's a food blogger. 
It's a long shot, but we need to get some exposure. 
Whoa, we are on vacation. 
No business talk. 
That was the deal, right? 
This is Zeke, chefslash author-slash-corporate sellout. 
We were, uh... 
We were thinking about going back to the apartment  to hang out. 
 Oh, sounds fun. 
Can I see you alone for a second? 
Well, not alone. 
I bring my tiny dog everywhere, so what? 
Come on, I heard of an after-party in Soho and an after-after-party in dumbo. 
So, let's go-ho. 
Have fun and get this vacation started. 
I'm holding a tiny dog at a bacon-book party and laughing with a guy who wrote a book about bacon. 
I think my vacation's already started. 
All right, well, have fun. 
I'm gonna go par-tay. 
Eh, did your thing, Ash. 
I don't want to say that I'm hot. 
But the bacon in my pocket is done. 
We said turns were five minutes, you bastards. 
Oh, hi. 
More sauna fun. 
Max, can I see you in the hall for a second? 
But it's my turn to sweat my balls off. 
Don't think the clock's not running while I'm out there. 
We're going on a real vacation. 
How quickly can you pack a bag? 
And don't worry about appropriate evening wear. 
Every four seasons has a Gucci near the Bulgari store in the lobby. 
None of those words made any sense. 
I think you've had a spring break stroke. 
No, seriously, there's a car waiting downstairs to take us to a private plane. 
We can be at Teterboro in 20 minutes and Tahiti in 8 hours. 
The Greek is paying for everything. 
What did they give you? 
What's the last thing you can remember? 
Nothing. 
I just had some cristal. 
Some cristal meth? 
No, I'm just really excited. 
I went to the after-party and this shipping magnate. 
Don't worry, it's not gonna be sexual. 
More like a father thing. 
Anyway, let's go... finally 
got us a good vacation. 
But we're having a good vacation. 
Max, don't take this personally, but you don't know what a good vacation is because you've never been anywhere. 
I mean, you walked into that apartment and your face lit up, like... 
Like it was amazing. 
And that's because you don't know that it's not. 
Trust me. 
I've been everywhere. 
And I'm telling you, this is the worst vacation ever. 
So let's ditch the bacon freak and the beer bro, get on that plane, spend one great day at the beach, and then come back and make $8 an hour. 
That sounds fun. 
You kind of skipped over the part where we get abducted and Nancy grace covers the year-long search for our bodies. 
It must be Constantine. 
He's gonna be upset. 
You never keep a Greek waiting. 
Oh, my God, Max, we just got an email on our website from that food blogger at the book party. 
She said if we drop off four cupcakes by tomorrow morning, she'll consider writing about them for her column that day. 
Well, what's it gonna be, Caroline or Ashley? 
Cupcakes or Tahiti? 
Your call. 
Is the Greek still waiting? 
He just pulled away. 
I'm sure he'll come back here for Ashley sometime. 
And when that happens, I wouldn't want to be her. 
Well, after tomorrow, you won't be. 
What can I do? 
You mean after your two personalities meet and kill each other? 
Max, I told you I needed a break. 
I just didn't know it was gonna be a psychotic one. 
You really need to chill. 
You can't keep freaking out because you're not where you want to be... 
On vacation or in our business. 
I mean, it's life. 
Lower your expectations. 
This microbrew is actually really good. 
Tastes better in the batter. 
Hey, crumble up some of that maple bacon for me. 
Sorry about that stuff I said about you never having gone anywhere. 
Why? 
I never have gone anywhere or done anything. 
And now I'm thinking that's kind of a good thing, because I can still get excited and make a face when something's new to me. 
'Cause, basically, everything is. 
That must be nice. 
All right, here, taste it. 
My beer-batter, maple bacon, spring break cupcake. 
Oh, my God, you made the "something new" face. 
I did, because you made something new. 
 It's delicious. 
 Do the face again. 
Oh, there they are, the world travelers. 
Shouldn't people be throwing confetti or something? 
I'm all out. 
I snorted mine in the power outage of '65. 
How was your vacation? 
Well, it turned out to be more of a daycation, but we had a great time, didn't we, Max? 
Yes, we did. 
Max, things sure are dull around here without you. 
Everyone walking around all P.C., 
nobody called me black. 
Hell. 
I haven't left once since you've been gone. 
When it comes to this job, you are my vacation. 
Aw. 
And that, Earl, is why I got all five of these gift bags for you. 
Welcome, again, to the Williamsburg diner. 
This way, please. 
I have looked up "down-low" and "rice queen" on Wikipedia. 
And, no, I'm not a secret homosexual or a man who chases only Asian men. 
I'm great, I'm straight. 
Get used to it. 
Hi, guys. 
How was your vacation? 
Great. Did you have fun 
at our place? 
Totes. 
Your saunas are sick. 
I know. 
Could they be any gayer? 
No. 
Just one thing. 
Wynonna's still a little upset about the anal gland event. 
What? 
I told you she wouldn't know it was a joke. 
How could she not know it was a joke? 
I mean, who would ask someone to squeeze their dog's pooper? 
We're paying you another 50. 
Dude, she went second knuckle deep in your beagle's back door for only another 50? 
150. 
Thank you. 
And just one other thing. 
Our business is actually not that great right now, so if you could recommend us to any of your friends,  that would really help. 
 Good for you. 
I'm sure business will pick up after that blog blurb. 
 Wait, blog blurb? 
 About your beerbattered maple bacon spring break cupcake. 
We just read about it. 
Yeah, in that foodie bitch's blog. 
Max, it worked. 
Let's go look at the blog on Han's computer. 
Excuse us. 
We'll be right back. 
We got a little break and a big break. 
Yeah, I did it again. 
Yeah. 
Welcome back. 
You missed the best two days of my life. 
Look, if you want to get all lesbian with me, just go for it. 
You don't have to pretend it's for the website. 
It is. 
And for the record, in 2009, when Katy Perry "kissed a girl and liked it," I kissed one and didn't. 
Ready? 
One... two... and... 
 Perfect. 
 Perfect? 
This photo does not say "Let us do your child's birthday party." 
It says "We're an AC/DC tribute band," and you can pay us in cocaine." 
Oleg, will you take a picture of us for our website? 
You realize you just asked a man who only takes pictures of his penis? 
Yes. 
But it's always well-lit, and perfectly in focus. 
You won't be disappointed. 
I take lots of website pictures. 
Yeah, but we're not wearing just bras and chicken masks. 
We have time. 
Maybe we should rethink the "coke whore" picture. 
Well, good night, ladies. 
Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite. 
And I remember a time in New York when that was more cute than accurate. 
 Good night, Earl. 
 Good night. 
Earl, I have come across a $6 inaccuracy in tonight's total. 
You must go over all checks again. 
Han, I'm just on my way home. 
But it is not yet 2:00 A.M. 
I hate to play the heavy, but you must sit down and go over checks again. 
Han, I am 75 years old. 
I don't even have enough time left to wipe twice. 
Well, well. 
Hello there. 
Such a gentleman. 
And what a well-behaved boy. 
Oh, there are the girls. 
Sophie, hello. 
You look pretty. 
Oh, I know. 
Oh, sorry, the kitchen's closed. 
 What? 
 Kitchen was closed... 
But can now be open again for such a beautiful woman. 
Hello. I am the chef. 
Oh, here we go. 
Ukraine's going to try to invade Poland. 
It's double d-day. 
Oleg, this is our neighbor, Sophie. 
I would like to have a plate with sausage on it while I look over the menu. 
Yowza. 
You are like someone super-sized Victoria's secret angel. 
I'd like to Gisele on your Bundchens. 
You're going to act like a dog, I'll treat you like a dog. 
Well, there goes his photography career. 
Do you still want the sausage? 
Yes, of course. 
Why should sausage suffer? 
You know how to handle yourself. 
 Impressive. 
 Mmhmm. 
That was like a game of "rock, paper, pervert." 
Sophie, thank you for coming in. 
Max and I wanted to talk to you about taking you up on your offer to work for your cleaning company. 
Yeah, she wants to do it for money to pay for our website, and I want to do it because I like rummaging through strangers' medicine cabinets. 
Have you cleaned houses before? 
Well, I had a house, and it was very clean. 
But whatever the task, you won't be sorry. 
Max and I are a great team, and when we set our mind to something, we accomplish it. 
 And if you consider giving us... 
 Oh, stop. 
This is not a dental school interview. 
Come on, this is scrubbing toilets. 
In or out? 
We're in. All the way. 
In my experience, when someone has to tell you they're all the way in, you'd better hope their tongue works. 
So dirty. 
We can start tomorrow. 
Just tell us where to go, and we'll be there. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, uh, you walk out your door, you take right, you go upstairs, you open my door, and you clean my apartment. 
Is audition. 
Can't I just take off my shirt like in fame? 
Excuse me. 
Here is your non-sexual appetizer. 
You and I will start small. 
You like? 
Yes. 
Good boy. Now go. 
Forced to clean Sophie's apartment? 
This is getting dicey. 
Next thing you know, we're locked in a crate on our way to the far east. 
Max, we're going to spend this money on our website. 
That's the future of our company. 
But the future is so far in the future, and I need this money now for real stuff, like gummi bears and eye liner. 
How do you think you get to the future? 
Uh, Marty McFly and a delorean? 
Besides, we don't need the website yet. 
We got the birthday cupcake job tomorrow without it. 
And where do you think we got that job? 
I don't know, the job fairy? 
What? I don't pay attention 
to the business stuff. 
I got the order at the web design company when I overheard someone say it was his son's fifth birthday. 
Gross. Using children 
for your own profit. 
Way to go, China. 
Well, here we are. 
Why is this big news? 
Come in. 
So, if this all works out today, I have two possible jobs for you. 
Two? That's amazing. 
This is the only way that I can make sure that you don't ruin my company's good name. 
'Cause I work hard to build "Sophie's choice." 
Now, uh, one of you take bathroom and one of you take out here. 
Who does which? 
Bathroom. I'm going to go with bathroom. 
I love a challenge. 
If not perfect clean, no job. 
Begin. 
Watch out, ladies. 
I'm about to go ham on this b-room. 
What is this "ham"? 
Hard as a mother. 
Max, I love when you're dirty. 
Oh. Very impressive. 
You clean like bull. 
Roar of cleaning. 
No big deal. 
I was lifting up couches when I was six to help my mom look for change and her boyfriend's tooth. 
I'm almost finished in here! 
This one like to make big announcements  about nothing, yes? 
 Yes. 
Hey, does that electric cigarette work? 
Yes, yeah. 
I smoked for seven years, and then I quit when I was 12. 
Yeah, I didn't want to die of lung cancer before I was teenager. 
Can I get a hit? 
Oh, yeah, please, try. 
I have many more in the drawers. 
I smoked the summer I shucked oysters on a gay cruise. 
Ooh, glamorous. 
Almost done. Two-minute warning. 
Be prepared to be amazed. 
Max, you shouldn't smoke. You'll get... 
What, electrocuted? 
This is silly. 
If I'm going to suck on something this hard and get no pleasure out of it, I should just date. 
I think you're going to be thrilled. 
Oh, she stinks. 
Spritz, spritz. She is sprayer. 
All mirror, no toilet. 
Well, you know, she's sort of new to this kind of work. 
She was born rich, but her father stole a bunch of money from people, and she was thrown out of her townhouse and disgraced. 
Yes, well, she clean like rich girl. 
"Hey, everybody, look, look what I'm doing. 
Oh, spritz, spritz." 
Oh! 
See, you not born rich, and you... you're like "roar." 
 Right? 
 Well. 
Cleaning's not her thing, but she has other strengths. 
Mm, I don't see them. 
Mm. 
Uh, so do we not have the job? 
No, I give you job, because one bull equal two girls. 
But why you need her, I don't know. 
You can make much more money on your own. 
Yeah, well, we're kind of a team. 
Listen, Max. Let me tell you something. 
She is like rock, tied to you, balloon. 
See, she hold you down. 
You cut her loose, and... 
Yeah, well, she's not weighing me down. 
I had lover who was rock. 
And I let him go, and... 
I'm finished, and I have to say, that bathroom? 
Nailed it. 
Don't push it. She saw it. 
She barely looked at it. 
I saw you in the mirror. 
Your eye never even looked down. 
Yes, that's because this eye doesn't go down. 
See, I'm trying. 
Yeah, I have blind spot from accident as child. 
When I was six years old, while working in Polish knock-off of McDonalds in warsaw, I fell on hot McStick. 
How did you fall on a hot stick? 
Not a stick that is hot. A hot McStick. 
It's meat on a stick, and it's very popular. 
They only have it, like, two times a year. 
It's like Mcribs. 
Sophie, I'm so sorry, that's awful. 
Yeah, but I bet that McStick thing is delicious. 
It is. 
Well, that must have been hard. 
I admire your courage. 
What are you, counsellor from UNICEF? 
You are acing this interview. 
Pffft... 
Do you know where we are? 
This whole building is models. 
Life is so funny. 
When I lived in Manhattan, I used to come to model parties here all the time. 
And now you clean up their poop. 
You're right. Life is funny. 
Here's the apartment upstairs tomorrow. 
 10 J. Here it is. 
 How do I look? 
Maybe he's the Abercrombie model from the Christmas ad in the white sleigh with the open fleece jacket and the eight-pack. 
I don't think it's him. 
Hi, I'm Big Bill. 
Come on in, girlies. 
How many packs did you say? 
Oh, what a lovely... oh! 
Oh, my God. 
Look, Max, he's a figure skater. 
Go ahead, take it all in. 
How could you not? 
It's okay, I'm a model. I'm used to it. 
Hey, I know you. You're the Big Bill. 
You're the guy from the gag greeting cards. 
Yep. I sold 2 million of 
that particular card. 
On the front it says, "You're on," when you open it up... 
 "Thin ice"! 
 Right. 
Oh, I've got to go in my bedroom and change. 
I'll be right back. 
Wow, Big Bill! 
No, big bye-bye. 
We're not staying here. 
If that's what's on the wall, who knows what's on the floor. 
Or trapped underneath it. 
This is an uncomfortable work environment. 
You were going to be on all fours scrubbing a toilet. 
It was always going to be an uncomfortable work environment. 
Okay, if we're staying, that's three times the amount of man. 
We should get double the money. 
I'm calling Sophie right now and telling her we should get more. 
Um, I would not suggest you complain to Sophie. 
It's not a good idea. 
Why? Do you know something I don't? 
She thinks you don't know how to clean, that you spritz, spritz. 
And what does she say about your cleaning skills? 
I'm a bull and I roar. 
I knew she didn't like me. 
She only has eye for you. 
Who cares what she thinks. 
Just clean better today. 
You do the living room. 
I'll do the bathroom. 
No, I'll do the bathroom, just to prove a point. 
I mean, reprove it. 
This is just like when they made me take the S.A.T.S again, 
away from all the asian kids. 
Oh! Oh, my God! 
Why are you freaking out? 
You've already seen him naked. 
It's not him. 
Have you seen the size of this toilet? 
That is a big-ass toilet. 
Literally. 
Max, I'm finished. 
The floor is so clean you could eat off it, and I'm sure he will. 
Come on in, I want you to see it. 
No, no, no, no, no, no. 
Go down, go down, stop. Never mind! 
Don't need you to see it. 
Everything's okay. 
How's it going out there? 
Either your water just broke, or you pee like a smurf. 
My shoes. 
No, you did not flush a whole roll of paper towels. 
No, you did not just use that tone with me when my good shoes are wet. 
Shut off the valve. 
The valve? 
Oh, God, what is wrong with you? 
How can you not know where a toilet valve is? 
I was rich. 
But you have to admit, the mirror? 
Nailed it. 
Wake up, you lazy bitch! 
 What? 
 Fire! 
I'm fired? Why, because of the toilet? 
Look at the oven, the cupcakes. 
I'm sorry. I fell asleep. 
I was just going to lay down for five minutes. 
I asked you to do one thing while I went out to get more milk... 
Take the cupcakes out of the oven. 
"Happy Birthday, kids. 
From Max's homemade cupcakes. 
"You can learn more about us and our blackened cupcakes on our expensive website." 
I'm sorry, Max. 
I just really needed a little siesta after all that cleaning. 
How are you so good at Spanish and so bad at cleaning? 
What is that smell? 
I grabbed my purse and ran. 
Caroline burned cupcakes. 
Oh, so sad. 
Look at all those burnt cakes. 
What happened here? 
Just a little mishap. 
I was so tired from cleaning that bathroom earlier, that I laid my head down for five minutes  and ended up falling asleep. 
 Aw... 
Such a shame. 
Oh, look Max. 
These cupcakes, they're hard as rocks. 
All you have to do is throw the rock away, and whee! 
I don't think Sophie likes me. 
What are you talking about? 
She loves you. 
No. I don't think she has a blind spot. 
I think she has a blonde spot... for me. 
Well, I think we've found the place where red bulls come to die. 
Man, why do I never get invited to parties like this? 
Look. Do you know what that means? 
Yeah, this building has a real shirt shortage. 
Oh, my God, do you think this might be the Abercrombie model's apartment? 
I doubt it's the Abercrombie model's apartment. 
Here's a note. 
It's addressed to "cleaning dood," "dude" spelled "d-o-o-d." 
It definitely might be the Abercrombie model's apartment. 
"Wake me when you get here ." He wants us to wake him. 
So, do you think he sleeps in the nude? 
Yeah, "nood", "n-o-o-d." 
Come on, let's go look. 
Oh, oh, oh, so what, seeing this guy naked is no longer an "uncomfortable work environment"? 
It's still uncomfortable, but in that exciting uncomfortable way. 
I think it is him. 
It's the guy who put the "abs" in Abercrombie. 
And he's naked. The good naked. 
Should we lift the sheet? 
Why not? I already lifted it in my mind. 
Max, I got this. 
You start cleaning up the mess out there. 
No, you start cleaning the mess out there... I got this. 
The bedroom's attached to the bathroom, and I always do the bathrooms, and he's my ideal type. 
And by "doing" the bathrooms do you mean flooding them, and by "ideal type," do you mean unconscious? 
Shh! We can talk about this out here. 
You're going to wake him. 
That's what we're supposed to do. 
But as usual, you don't want to do the job. 
What's wrong with you? 
You're acting weird. 
Well, why should I have to do all the heavy lifting while you just get to nap and see free model penis? 
All the heavy lifting? 
Where'd you get that from? 
No one. 
Sophie. 
I knew she didn't like me. 
It's not that she doesn't like you, she just doesn't think you're... 
What? Doing anything? 
She thinks I'm not pulling my weight? 
She thinks I'm dead weight? 
Not dead weight, more like... a rock... 
To my balloon. 
What is that, some kind of Polish haiku? 
What does that even mean? 
She thinks if I cut the rock loose, I'll go... fuuuuu! 
Wait, so you're siding with a woman you met a week ago over me? 
I'm not siding with anyone. 
I'm just saying... 
I know what this is. 
This is "Pick on the rich girl." 
It's a poverty smackdown. 
I heard you two talking while I was in her bathroom, spritz spritzing. 
You think you do everything? 
Fine, do everything. 
You can "balloon" all over this place, 'cause the "rock" is leaving. 
Who is it? 
You're the rock! I'm the balloon! 
Without me lifting you out of your negative rockness, you wouldn't even have a cupcake business. 
I'm the reason we even have cupcake jobs. 
Oh, oh, you're the reason? 
Who stayed up all last night baking 24 more cupcakes while you were sleeping? 
You did. And who delivered 
the cupcakes this morning while you were sleeping? 
I did. Me. The balloon. 
I floated over there and got paid for the job that I got us from the website that I'm trying to pay for. 
And now, I'm going to float down this hall and wake the hot model up 'cause, contrary to what you and your poverty gal-pal might think, I always do the job I'm hired for. 
Oh, no! I am going to wake him up. 
Free model penis is my reward for doing everything and being tied to a rock like you. 
Oh, see? I can't get away, 
because you're the rock and you're heavier than my balloon. 
Hey, stop! 
This is cleaning job, not gorgeous ladies of wrestling. 
Good thing I stopped by to check on you. 
 What is all this? 
 You explain it. 
I'm going to go wake the hot model up. 
He left a note. Just doing my job. 
As usual. 
So, you think I'm holding Max back? 
What kind of question is this? 
Yes. 
Well, you're wrong. We're a great team. 
And, yes, there are some things she's better at. 
But there are other areas where I excel. 
Well, I don't see them. 
That's probably because of your eye. 
Did you wake him up? 
Uh, no. I think he might be dead. 
Oh, no, not the hot one! 
Aw, he's my favorite. 
This is all I need on yelp. 
We should call 911. 
No, I got it. 
What are you going to do? 
I'm going to give him mouth-to-mouth. 
I didn't know there was so much tongue involved. 
This is not working. 
But, you know what? 
I know he's still alive, because his manhood is knocking on my lady door. 
He must have taken too many of those pills on the table. 
Pills? I got this. 
Max, go get some hydrogen peroxide. 
 Sophie, step aside, now. 
 Oh, all right. 
You sure you know what you're doing? 
My friend Candace travelstead od'd like three times in college, and I brought her back twice. 
There you go. 
Bring him up. 
Max, you hold his head back, open his mouth. 
Back up. 
I'm starting to see your worth. 
What? You're being subway creepy. 
I have to say, when you were punching that almost-dead guy in the stomach, that was a serious balloon move. 
The truth is, we're both balloons. 
Yeah, but mine is, like, way cooler than yours. 
It's like one of those silver ones that never goes out of air. 
They don't make those anymore. 
They're toxic. 
Exactly. 
Max, you know you won't let me come into the kitchen and help you bake, right? 
And you know that I know that without you, the job fairy would never show up, right? 
But if you ever need me to help you bake, I could. 
No, it's cool. 
You do your thing, I'll do mine. 
Hey, get your phone. 
We should capture this near-death victory moment as our website picture. 
Totally. 
On the count of three, think... 
"We made $200." 
One... two... 
Hold up. 
Sir, if you want to go home with that hand, get it off my ass. 
Okay, three. 
Sandwich, burger.

Why the big smile, Han? 
You going commando under those corduroys? 
No, Max, I am happy today because diner clientele has finally changed for the better. 
Look, two parties of cool hipsters are sitting at tables near wall. 
You think those are six hipsters? 
Okay, let's go over this one more time. 
Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready? 
 Ready. 
 Hipsters wear? 
Skinny jeans. 
 Homeless wear? 
 Dirty jeans. 
 Hipsters listen to? 
 Radiohead. 
 Homeless listen to? 
 The voices in their head. 
 Hipsters have? 
 Beard and a blog. 
 Homeless have? 
 Beard and so much sadness. 
I see sadness, there and there. 
I'll handle this. 
I told you before, I don't want you kind in here. 
Take a trendy hike. 
Better step it up. 
The apple store closes at ten. 
Max, why did you kick out the hipsters? 
'Cause I could not be in the background of another Instagram photo.

Here's the last check, Earl. 
And, Max, they stiffed us on the tip but they forgot their camera. 
Oh, I'll give it to Oleg. 
He can take one of his special pictures. 
That way, when they come back to get it, everyone will have been stiffed. 
Well, good night, ladies. 
I gotta get home before the snow starts. 
It's not gonna snow, Earl, it's 50 degrees. 
Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me. 
I couldn't tell when my first wife was coming, but I can sure tell when a storm is coming. 
All right, so what's the plan? 
What are we gonna do if it does snow? 
You're so white, I'm worried we're gonna lose you. 
I love the snow. 
Opening my balcony doors and watching it fall like fresh white linen and then running across the street to the park to make snow angels. 
Yeah, that's snow when you're rich. 
The only snow angels you'll see this year are the six crack addicts frozen to our stoop. 
Oh, not to mention the adorable frozen horse we have illegally living in the backyard. 
Max, don't overreact. 
Chestnut's fine. 
It's not gonna snow for weeks. 
All right, have it your way. 
But I wouldn't want to be the next tenants who have to figure out why a pissed off horse is haunting a Brooklyn apartment. 
I was cold and she thought she knew weather patterns. 
Oleg, take a picture of your junk on this customer's camera. 
Done. 
Aren't you gonna ask why? 
No need. 
I just saw Oleg's... 
Yeah, that might have been my fault. 
Kind of a shock seeing it for the first time. 
Max, I don't like you implying that I would ever be cruel to Chestnut. 
I'm not implying it. 
I'm saying it outright. 
It's winter. 
And it's not like I've not been thinking about it. 
But Chestnut belongs in a special home. 
You belong in a special home. 
I've done some research, and I found a retreat in the Grand Tetons where newly-divorced women come to hug horses to help them gain back their ability to trust. 
The only Grand Tetons Chestnut trusts are mine. 
Lady, you gotta get a reality check real quick 'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow. 
Earl also thinks the theme from shaft was stolen from a cassette tape he sent out in 1975. 
Shut your mouth. 
That happened. 
Max, it's not gonna snow. 
I know snow. 
We owned a ski chalet in Saas-Fee Switzerland and I think I know more than anyone in this restaurant about living in cold climes. 
Snow is coming. 
Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have a conversation about cold climes with Snowleg over there? 
Oh, Max, I almost forgot. 
The camera. 
I think you'll be very pleased. 
I made a little video as well. 
Why are you wearing two coats? 
Same reason I wear two condoms. 
In case one breaks. 
What the? 
Well, good morning, world's worst weather girl. 
I have never seen so much sunshine. 
You know what that means? 
Earl wrote shaft. 
Max, I know it snowed, you don't have to tell me. 
I'm surrounded by so much white stuff I'm like Al Pacino in the last scene of Scarface. 
What are you wearing? 
You look like a bag of crazy garbage grew arms. 
It's the hefty 2011 winter collection. 
I gave Chestnut my coat. 
This is the only way to keep the snow off me. 
Look at poor Chestnut. 
What is he wearing on his hooves? 
I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings. 
I grabbed them when we raided the town house. 
I thought ahead for me, but not for him. 
He is humiliated in those ladies clothes. 
He looks like j. Edgar hoover. 
I've been out here sweeping since 4:00 A.M. 
But it just keeps coming down. 
What is your problem, snow? 
I used to love you! 
Maybe we should ask your old doorman "insert generic Irish name here" to come help. 
I know their names. 
Day James, night James and black James. 
So your plan is you're gonna sweep the snow away till spring while the horse is trapped under this tarp? 
Which I'm pretty sure was covering the out of business Cuban restaurant down the street. 
They were out of business and I left a note. 
What did it say? 
"I'm loco, gracias." 
No, it said, "sorry I took your roof, hang in there.: 
Max, don't be so negative. 
Doesn't matter where it came from, it's working. 
I just need to secure this tarp a little. 
Stop, you were gonna climb on an icy chair in six inch heels and break your neck and then I'm gonna be stuck with a horse in leggings and you in a wheelchair with a chopstick in your mouth tapping out, "I'm sorry, I thought that would work." 
I learned to build when I volunteered with habitat for humanity. 
Looking back, they had so much more than I have now. 
Okay. 
I gotta go to my babysitting job and when I get back, you and I are gonna sit down and come up with a more realistic home for j. Edgar hoofer. 
Max, he lives here. 
And I'm telling you, this is working. 
What I'm doing is actually kind of brilliant. 
Now I'm worried about those houses you built. 
Hey, Peach. 
Max, I have the most incredible news. 
Lawyer finally found a loophole in your prenup? 
I wish, no. 
I just got an email and I have made it to the final round of casting for Real Housewives of Tribeca. 
Real Housewives of Tribeca? 
They're doing neighborhoods now? 
What's next, Real Housewives of from here to there? 
The producers are on their way over and I want everything to be perfect when they see Brad and Angelina. 
Uh, Peach, are you aware that your children are being eaten by clothing? 
The snowsuits are Burberry. 
And the padding hides Angelina's weight problem. 
Okay, you have to stop saying that. 
She doesn't have a weight problem. 
She's gained 25 pounds in one year. 
Yeah, 'cause she started at zero. 
Max, we all have to look our best, 'cause ready? 
The last spot in the show is between me and Misty Mastbaum. 
I thought she was your bestie. 
She is, but my bestie's a bitchy. 
She's crazy competitive. 
As soon as we were approached about the show, she adopted a three-legged corgi and named it Mr. Pickle. 
That's crazy bitchy. 
So now, I'm looking up handicapped animals to impress the producers. 
Oh, you want a handicapped animal? 
I got your handicapped animal. 
I know a homeless horse with gender identity issues. 
I was thinking something cute, but damaged. 
Like a one-eyed French bulldog. 
What if I told you that this horse was a celebrity horse? 
Tell me more. 
My friend, Caroline Channing... 
How do you know Caroline Channing? 
She's my AA sponsor. 
Makes sense. 
Go on. 
Anyway, she has this cute, but crazy damaged horse and since her life flipped upside down, he needs a good home. 
Well, I'd have to meet Caroline first. 
Bring her by on Saturday. 
Max, what an amazing idea. 
Misty is literally going to die. 
I am so thrilled you have a drinking problem. 
Did you have to put him in my bedroom? 
It was the easiest room to horse proof. 
You have so little of worth. 
You can stop googling. 
I already found a perfectly good place to put him. 
You're not still suggesting I give Chestnut to Peach Landis? 
Max, look at me. 
Look at me in the eyes. 
Are you high? 
No, I couldn't find my bedroom stash since you moved everything around. 
Chestnut needs a home with affection and Peach won't even hug her children. 
She pays you to do that. 
That's why it's perfect. 
She'll pay for the fancy stable and we'll go and hug Chestnut for her whenever we want. 
You just need to go meet her and it's done. 
I have the DNA of a rich girl, even though I'm lying in bed with you in a tenement and I bought my dinner tonight with dimes. 
Chestnut and I are old money. 
And old money doesn't parade itself around in front of cameras and beg for attention. 
Hey, you're not the only one with old money. 
I've had a dollar in my jeans I've been carrying around for three weeks. 
You're meeting Peach Saturday, and we're saying good-bye to the horse. 
Why is getting rid of Chestnut so easy for you? 
Didn't you ever have a pet as a child? 
Yes, I had a puppy. 
And after a week of living with my mom, he pulled the car over and put us out on the side of the road. 
She got rid of it? 
Look, pets are not my thing, okay? 
I already have something needy and Fluffy that'll die if I don't take care of it... you. 
Go, it's your turn to go check on him. 
No, I went the last time and caught him eating my bra. 
Don't exaggerate. 
He only ate half of it. 
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right, I should be more positive. 
One of my cups is half full. 
What's going on in there? 
I don't suppose there's any way you took a giant dump on your dresser? 
You can't blame Chestnut. 
He's probably nervous. 
After wearing your leggings, he's getting ready for his fame audition. 
He's a maniac, maniac on all fours. 
Oh, Max, here's something. 
The Ivy bridge riding stables in Brooklyn. 
Only five Miles away. 
It says on their website that their horses are featured in commercials and films! 
Can you say Chestnut, star of the war horse sequel? 
Did you take the weed from my bedside table? 
Look at me. 
Look at me in the eyes. 
Are you high? 
Honestly... a little. 
Close that and go to sleep. 
No, I'm still reading. 
Oh look at that, I just pulled down your browser history. 
Interesting list. 
Kitten plays a keyboard, kitten sneezes and farts at the same time? 
Give me that, that's private. 
Kitten folds a t-shirt! 
Oh, kitten rings a doorbell. 
I thought you said you weren't into pets. 
I'm not! 
It's a kitten ringing a doorbell! 
He's trying to get in like people. 
You have a secret soft spot for animals. 
No, I'm just into freaky kittens. 
There's one who puts on a snakeskin suit and goes on a business trip. 
That's not soft. 
That is freaky. 
Fine, you're telling me to get a reality check about Chestnut. 
But you need one too. 
You're gonna miss him when he's gone. 
Max, are you listening? 
Max, don't worry. 
I know it's all gonna work out perfectly at the stables tomorrow. 
I'm not worried. 
The man's not here yet. 
Damn it, turn us around Max, we have to enter again. 
This is the third time. 
Max, come on, we borrowed these coats from Oleg to make a dramatic star entrance. 
If you want me to fake it again, you have to buy me dinner and call me pretty. 
Fine, then help me down quickly. 
I don't wanna be mid-dismount when the stable guy walks in. 
God, ugh. 
You just sat on my face. 
Like I haven't done enough for you. 
Oh, hello, are you Tony? 
Last time I checked. 
Oh, jeez. 
I'm Caroline Channing. 
We spoke on the phone. 
And this is Chestnut. 
Max, step back. 
Oh, great. 
I'll just be over here like the awkward father in the background on Toddlers and Tiaras. 
Well, here he is. 
And as we discussed, Chestnut is a champion jumper his dressage is impeccable, he's ribboned three times at the Hampton Classic, and he comes from a historically elite line of distinguished show horses. 
And he pees like a civil rights fire hose. 
Max, step further back. 
Come on, let's cut to the chase. 
He's nice, brown, he looks sick in leggings, and he's free, so take him or leave him. 
When'd you say he was a jumper? 
From 2005 to 2010. 
He was in a class by himself. 
Well, maybe he was a jumper, but he isn't anymore. 
What? 
Well, he's a little out of shape. 
Well, you have a gut. 
Whoa! I'm just saying 
he's seen better days. 
I'm just saying your hair is falling out in fistfuls. 
 Whoa! 
 Okay, okay. 
Let's not get personal, we all want this to work. 
He's the one who's getting personal going after Chestnut like that. 
Okay, you tell me, when's the last time he's exercised? 
When's the last time you exercised? 
Wow, show business is rough. 
All right, it's Tony, right? 
Last time I checked. 
All right, Tony, you'll have to forgive her. 
She really loves him and wants this to work out. 
Bottom line is, even a free horse isn't free. 
I still have to feed him and take care of him and truth be told, this horse isn't gonna make me a penny. 
If my film guy comes in here, he's gonna pick that beauty over this one. 
Oh. 
So it's not gonna work out, girls. 
All right, well, we got other offers, fatty. 
Come on, let's go. 
You know, maybe next time before you let someone ride five Miles across Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian, cologne-soaked rent-a-fur, you should be clear that the film business, even for horses, is ageist and elitist. 
And, yes, we may have seen better days, but with hard work, determination and a little luck, one day we'll be back on top. 
Yeah, and I'm not impressed by your big star pony over there. 
He's just standing still. 
You wanna impress me? 
Have him meow and ring the doorbell. 
Don't take it personally, Chestnut. 
Those horses have had work done. 
+ maybe you wanna take the cinch sack off before you meet Peach. 
No it's snowing again and I'm a penniless beggar. 
I should look like one. 
Besides, she'll probably think it's a look. 
All right, I know this one on one with Peach isn't your ideal scenario, but it's what's best for Chestnut so man up and face reality. 
You're right. 
And my friend, Caroline Channing... 
What is it? 
You might be ready to face reality, but are you ready to face reality TV? 
The place is crawling with Peach clones and TV cameras ready to meet you. 
She totally set us up. 
Are you kidding me? 
Fabulous, this is awesome, just awesome. 
She's using the Caroline Channing freak show to get herself on another freak show. 
All right, you're right, let's go, you don't have to do this. 
No, if I made Chestnut parade around and be humiliated in public, then I have to be willing to do the same. 
Here, hold my coat. 
You always have those with you? 
Yes, I'm from Manhattan. 
 Okay, thank me for coming. 
 What? 
Thank me for coming, that's what people did all the time when I was a billionaire. 
Thank you for coming. 
No, thank you for inviting me. 
Wow, that's so cool. 
Don't freak out. 
I'm about to get my rich on. 
So when we go in there I'll introduce you? 
Oh, you don't have to. 
Rich people always pretend to know each other. 
Now open that door, and let's get my baby a home. 
Peach. 
I wanna thank you for inviting me into your beautiful home and showing me such kindness during this very difficult, difficult time. 
Ladies, I would like you all to meet my dear friend, Caroline Channing. 
Who, in light of her recent very difficult, difficult financial troubles, has asked me to adopt her damaged pet horse who was brought to my attention by my alcoholic servant, Max. 
Right over there. 
Caroline, thank you for coming. 
No, thank you for inviting me. 
I'm proud of you. 
No, I'm proud of you. 
I just got the chills again. 
Oh, Max, look at him. 
He's smiling. 
He likes this place. 
Yeah, it's almost worth you being humiliated on reality TV. 
Oh, I'll never be on that show. 
I didn't sign the release. 
What? 
Old money don't sign. 
You're gonna love it here, huh? 
Aren't you gonna love it here? 
A nice big stable. 
Maybe I will, maybe I won't. 
Maybe I should come home and live with my best friend, Max. 
What about Caroline? 
She can sleep under the tarp. 
So I guess you found your weed. 
No, this is just something we do when we're alone together. 
It's kind of our thing. 
You really love Chestnut, don't you? 
He's all right. 
He's no kitten. 
Okay, I'll see you soon, Chestnut. 
You want a minute alone? 
I'll be out front. 
Hey. 
This is probably gonna seem ridiculous to you because you're a horse and I'm just some lady that's been slipping you carrots for the last few months, but... 
I really got attached to you. 
This is way more than most horses get out of me. 
I wasn't even this upset when they discontinued tan m&ms. 
I, um... 
I really haven't had much go right for me in my life, and I'm pretty sure things are gonna keep getting worse but, you were a good thing. 
And when everything sucked, you were the best thing we had going. 
And you're fuzzy too. 
You're so fuzzy, and no one can argue that touching a warm, fuzzy thing isn't straight up lovely. 
So, thank you for everything you did for us, but... 
Especially for being fuzzy. 
Max, are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always be fine. 
Are you crying? 
Yeah, I'm crying, 'cause I wish I could live here. 
Don't worry, we'll come visit, and we'll find a way to bring him home in the spring. 
Come on. 
I have a pocket full of dimes. 
Let's go get some convenience store taquitos and wash 'em down with blue raspberry wine coolers. 
They're on sale at the bodega. 
Two four packs for five dollars. 
You know exactly what to say to cheer a broke sista up. 
And when we get home, I found a video of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.

﻿1 Pick up... chicken breasts. 
The way I know you want it, with the bone in. 
We really should hold a seminar about sexual harassment in the workplace. 
Why? He's already 
so good at it. 
I'm serious. 
How'd he like it if we did that to him every time we ordered? 
Well, let's find out. 
Ordering. 
One pastrami. 
Can you do me a favor, doll-face? 
Make it so big and thick, you can't get your mouth around it. 
Can you do that for me? 
Yes, and two matzo ball soups, hold the balls. 
Wait, I'll hold the balls, you just sit there and look pretty. 
And a cream of... 
nope, can't. 
Just grossed myself out. 
When is it going to get dirty? 
Max, come out. 
If I came out, it would not be for you, it's be for that hot dragon tattoo girl. 
Welcome, board members, to the very first financial assessment meeting of Max's homemade cupcakes. 
I was told there would be a cheese plate. 
After five months in business, we're showing a profit of $725. 
I have to say, I'm a little disappointed. 
Really? 'Cause, dude, 
we have so far exceeded where I thought we'd be in five months. 
Look, we have to find a way to make more money on the side to put into the business. 
Or we could quit now, while we're a success. 
What are you talking about? 
It's only gonna get worse. 
Or it could get better. 
Why would you even say that? 
Because it's life, and life gets worse, that's what it does. 
On life's resume, under special skills it says, "good at making things worse." 
 Do you always go to the worst-case scenario? 
Yup. 
On my resume it says, "good at going to the worst case scenario." 
Do you think you could try to be more optimistic, and not expect the worst all the time? 
Who's that? 
More optimistic, right? 
On the other side of that door is all the money you lost, and then we move back into your townhouse, and I masturbate in your tub for a change. 
It was twice, and you could have knocked. 
Who is it? 
Detective James, NYPD. 
Wait, don't open it! 
Don't open it! 
Oh, smoked it tuesday. 
Open. 
Sorry to bother you, miss. 
Do you live in this apartment? 
I'm gonna tell you right now, officer, our names aren't on the lease. 
We're an illegal sublet with no place else to go. 
Please, mercy. 
Sorry, officer, it's her first raid. 
Relax, the landlord didn't send me. 
   What do you know about the tenant who lives in the apartment directly above you? 
His name is Lou. 
Leo? 
Saul? 
Am I even close? 
His name's Nirham Chaduri. 
Oh, man, I wasn't even on the right continent. 
Is that Nirham Chaduri? 
Been dead for two weeks. 
Lived alone, nobody knew. 
Cats eat his face? 
Max, could you please not be so dark? 
Kittens eat his face? 
What? I'm just trying to put 
a more positive spin on things. 
Where are you going with that? 
That's my good China with huckleberry hound on it. 
I'm making a "hello" cupcake plate for our neighbors across the hall. 
Oh, no, you're not. 
It's weird not to know your neighbors. 
No, it's weird not to know your father, but by the time you're four, you get over it and move on. 
This is a mistake. 
Who knows what's lurking behind that door? 
Yes, something awful, like nice people, who might look out for us, or say, "hello," in the hallway when they see you. 
No matter what comes out of there, I will not be "hello-ing" it up in the hallway. 
You got lucky. 
Get back in here. 
Who is it, please? 
 Caroline, your next-door neighbor. 
Hi. 
Uh, is this a bad time? 
Not at all. 
One sec. 
Hi. 
I just wanted to introduce myself and my roommate, Max. 
There, and give you these cupcakes. 
That is so nice. 
Well, it's the leash... 
least... least I can do. 
Well, I gotta go. 
Well, if we ever get a dog, we know who can walk it. 
 Listen. 
 I know. 
It's only been a few days, and somebody's already moved in upstairs. 
And they are playing music! 
Music is coming through the floor into my ears. 
I blame you for this. 
When you knocked on that door across the hall, you might have opened a portal to hell. 
There, you hear the devil music? 
I think it's the bee gees. 
Exactly. 
And walking! 
Walking and music, we have to stop this right now. 
It's 10:00, people are allowed to walk and play music. 
Your lack of apartment knowledge is really starting to piss me off. 
We have to show him right now not to screw us. 
I need paper. 
 What are you doing? 
I mean, besides over-reacting? 
Writing a threatening note. 
If we don't shut this down now, next thing you know, someone's having an academy awards party in your living room. 
Is that what you want? 
Strangers passing out mini Oscar statues that say, "best nachos?" 
"I have an unregistered gun and can shoot you through the floor"? 
You're coming in really hot, Max. 
We're not giving him this. 
It'll start a bad dynamic between us. 
God, how I miss the quiet, dead indian guy. 
Okay, we're gonna hit and run. 
Oh, you mean "run," literally. 
Shh, listen. 
Reading the note, freaking out... 
Music off, problem solved. 
Respect! 
Never doubt, never doubt. 
Crossing the floor to the door, Closing the door, Coming down the stairs, What do we do? 
Move? 
What's he look like? 
He's got his finger over the peephole. 
Okay, game on. Back up! 
This is my building, I've got to take it back. 
 Max, this is life, not call of duty: Modern warfare 3. 
Move. 
What is meaning of this horrible, horrible note? 
Oh, you're not a man? 
What kind of question is this? 
Do I look like a man? 
No, but you clump around up there like a man. 
Max, please. 
Did you write this horrible, horrible note? 
I did. 
First day in my new home and I'm given this horrible, horrible note, with threats. 
Well, they're not actually threats. 
"I will gut you like a hog." 
To be clear, I only skimmed the note. 
Everything was happening so fast. 
Listen, we've obviously gotten off to a bad start. 
Please come in. 
Why would I want to come in with you horrible, horrible... 
ooh, cupcake land. 
Ooh. 
Yes, we have a cupcake business. 
We're just starting, but doing well. 
Max is the baker. 
Say hello, Max. 
I know people in the mob. 
That's Max, and I'm Caroline. 
You are? 
Sophie Kuchenski. 
Is that a polish accent I'm detecting? 
Yes. 
I visited Warsaw once, I love it. 
Oh, 'cause I hate it. 
Rats and pimps. 
Why have you not yet offered me cupcake? 
It's the least thing you can do, after horrible, horrible note. 
Oh, sure. 
Chocolate or vanilla? 
Yes. 
Why such sourpuss? 
Sorry about that. 
It's just, we work long hours at the neighborhood diner, and Max has another job as well, and then she comes home and she has to make the cupcakes. 
Mmm. 
So good. 
Mmm. 
How could someone so angry make something so sweet? 
She's not always like this. 
I'm usually like this, just ask the previous tenant. 
Oh, wait. 
You can't. 
You know, you two girls are like these cupcakes. 
One is dark and heavy and one is light and fluffy. 
I prefer the fluffy one. 
Well, I think we've made our point. 
No music, no clumping, I'll shoot you through the floor, thanks for stopping by. 
I'm so glad we can joke with each other already. 
Sorry about the note, can we start ov... 
you have the chanel allure lip gloss? 
Yeah. 
Mm, you know the chanel? 
Know? Love. 
I can't afford it any more. 
Oh, take one. 
I got handfuls in my bag. 
Really? 
Oh, that's so nice. 
Both: Ahh. 
Hey. 
Hey! Hey! 
Do I have to put you on a leash? 
Hey, we start again. 
You take a chanel, and I take more cupcakes to go. 
Oh, sure. 
Yes. 
techno music] I knew it. 
Bitch played us for cupcakes. 
It's 3:00 A.M. 
Why are you dressed? 
Never took off my clothes, 'cause soldiers don't. 
We have to be ready when the enemy attacks. 
Okay, you were right, I was wrong. 
Why do you have the broom? 
'Cause I ran out of finger bullets. 
Wait, you're gonna fall. 
I can't believe we have a broom. 
All this time I've been sweeping with an us weekly. 
I knew this would happen, but I didn't say anything, 'cause you were all, "Max is the worst-case scenario." 
Well, we showed weakness and now, look. 
And by "we," I mean "you." 
Deal with this, cupcake thief! 
Yeah, one more time, and hard. 
Okay, now she broke our house. 
We're in a war. 
She wants a piece of me, she's gonna get it. 
Where are my heels? 
I mean, who did she think I am? 
Someone she can just buy off with a tube of chanel? 
Well, your legs did kind of snap back over your head pretty quick when she offered it. 
more than a woman] I thought you were man with pizza. 
You have a porch swing in there. 
You have an electric cigarette. 
What is it you two girls want? 
Uh, I forgot. 
Just so thrown by the swing and the everything. 
Oh, you're taking advantage of us by still playing that music after we talked. 
You two are harshing my marshmallow. 
So I'm gonna have to call my friend the landlord tomorrow and tell him about the horrible, horrible note. 
Mmm. 
techno music] Oh, my God, she's a hooker. 
I've been using a hooker's lip gloss. 
She's not a hooker. 
Oh, good. 
She's too old, she's a madame. 
You've been using an old hooker's lip gloss. 
Max, look, my lip. 
Is this something? 
I feel like I'm getting one. 
For the last time, you cannot get a herpes breakout in under ten hours. 
 You're right, now I'm jumping to the worst-case scenario. 
Maybe her lip gloss wasn't a herpes breeding ground. 
Maybe she's not a prostitute. 
Maybe those young girls weren't being held there against their will. 
Yeah, maybe she just has sleepovers with women on swings in the their nighties. 
You know, like people do. 
Welcome to Williamsburg diner. 
How many in your party? 
What kind of question is this? 
One, I am my own party. 
I take booth. 
Now, now, who is that over there? 
Our new upstairs neighbor. 
Earl, does she look like a prostitute to you? 
Well, I don't like to judge a book by its cover, but if she was a book, she'd be the kind that other books pay for sex. 
Sophie just came in, Earl thinks she's a hooker, and now my lip is feeling very courtney love. 
I invited her here for a free meal, we have to make this work out for us. 
Last night, she threatened to call her "friend," the landlord, and that can never happen. 
We're illegal tenants, and I'd rather have a noisy roof over my head than no roof. 
Let me do the talking. 
You're too upset, and you might say something insulting. 
Like what? 
"Hi, thanks for the lip gloss "and the series of uncomfortable conversations with every lover I'll have for the rest of my life." 
You don't need to tell them, they'll figure it out eventually. 
Hi, thanks for coming in. 
I like the uniforms. 
You fill out the front nicely, and you with no boobs, short-short skirts. 
Smart girls. 
Uh, we just wanted to offer you a free dinner, as our way of apologizing. 
So are you ready to order? 
What kind of question is this? 
Did you see this horrible, horrible menu? 
We can't have nice conversation here. 
Tomorrow I take you to nice place, my treat. 
Oh, you don't have to do that. 
No, no, I, too, want to apologize. 
You know, after you two left the other night, some of my girls said that I was harsh on you. 
Yes, all those girls work for me. 
Excuse me, I have to go to the ladies' room right now and look at my lips. 
Thank you so much for inviting us. 
Are you enjoying that beluga? 
Mmm, so much. Thank you. 
I haven't had caviar in forever. Mmm. 
Legs over your head much? 
So, sourpuss, you don't like caviar? 
No, I'm more of a cheeseburger kind of girl. 
 Oh. 
 This place is busy. 
The waiters must make a fortune. 
Oh, yeah, 300, 350 a night. 
What do you girls make? 
60 to 80 on a good night. 
And how do you expect you will accomplish cupcake business on money like this? 
Well, we're just starting out. 
Yes, but at this rate, it will take forever. 
You know, I, too, have big dream. 
I am building summer house by lake in Poland. 
You want to see? 
Oh, you have pictures? 
No, I have house. 
This is model from the architect. 
And I take it everywhere I am, to remember where I'm going. 
It's cool. 
See, girls like you should be making more money. 
Maybe you could consider coming to work for me. 
 Sophie! 
 Oh. 
Thank you for sending girl to my apartment yesterday. 
Oh, did she do the job? 
Oh, like no one ever before. 
Down on all fours, under, over, under again. 
Oh!  
Well, my girls don't leave until you're satisfied. 
Maybe she can come two times a week. 
She can come whenever you want her to come. 
Are these two of your girls? 
Well, we were just discussing that. 
Well, this one here looks like she can take a lot. 
Uh, thanks? 
My friend Yanni is at the bar. 
Since his divorce, he's in great need of your service. 
Prosze. 
Oh, yes. 
Uh, excuse me, and, um, don't touch my house. 
I can't believe she would actually consider asking us to be prostitutes. 
I know. 
I mean, me, I get, but you, I don't see it. 
You heard the guy, I look like I could "take a lot." 
Max, it's not funny. 
Isn't it bad enough i may hurt bees from her chanel gloss? 
Of course we're not gonna do it, but come on, you'd be a terrible hooker. 
Thank you, I would be a terrible hooker. 
I have a heart, and soul, and dreams, and want to fall in love and have a family. 
Oh, just say it, you're bad in bed. 
Let's get out of here. 
I mean, really, who does she think I am? 
Someone who would just sell myself to have nice things? 
Let me just suck down a little more of this, and we're off. 
If we walk out of here now, we can just keep walking to the homeless shelter. 
 Well, I'd rather be homeless than a hooker. 
Here she comes. 
Sit down! 
Let's thank her and politely decline. 
Okay, back to what we were discussing. 
Uh, thanks. 
We appreciate the offer, but we are going to pass. 
So you don't want to accomplish your dream? 
Well, uh, I'm not exactly sure those two things line up, but thanks. 
I thought you were smart girls. 
We are smart girls, and smart girls don't have to sell their bodies to accomplish their goals. 
Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
It works for you, but us? 
Well, she's bad in bed and I have a sour puss. 
What guy wants to pay for that?  
You think I am prostitute? 
No, everyone has swings with girls in pajamas. 
My business card. 
Home cleaning service. 
She runs a cleaning company. 
"Sophie's choice." 
You realize what this means? 
 We insulted a hard-working woman who was trying to help us attain our goal? 
Yes. 
And I don't have herpes! 
I should have listened to you. 
Meeting neighbors is a big mistake. 
And meeting neighbors and calling them a prostitute? 
Bigger mistake. 
Plus, we have to kick in 60 for the check. 
What can we possibly say to her? 
That we're sorry, and please keep playing the bee gees day or night as loud as she wants. 
Not a good idea to be smiling right now. 
I'm just so happy I don't have herpes. 
Hi, is this a bad time? 
Yes. Yes, I'm in the middle of 
having sex for money with every man in Brooklyn. 
What do you horrible, horrible girls want? 
Here, you left part of your dream on the table. 
And we want to apologize. 
I'm new at this whole being neighborly thing. 
What does the fluffy one have to say? 
Thank you for being so generous, and for offering to help us make more money to accomplish our dream. 
And this is supposed to make me feel better? 
You called me prostitute. 
Actually, it's kind of a compliment that we thought you were stunning enough that men would pay to have sex with you. 
This is true. 
Come on in. 
more than a woman]  Thinking about those people...  
Saturday night fever is my favorite movie. 
Look at him. 
He's so sexy. 
He's not that cute, kind of oily. 
You're right. 
She would have made terrible prostitute. 
That's a nice TV. 
 Yeah, brandnew. 
I have all my girls over the other night for viewing sleepover party. 
It's also 3-d. 
 Does it come with 3-d glasses? 
Yeah, in the drawer there. 
 Here. 
 Max, it's not a 3d movie. 
 Who cares? 
It's 3-d glasses. 
Come on, you're always talking about wanting us to see things differently. 
Oh, so cool. 
This swing is a brilliant idea. 
Yeah, it's for my porch at lake house. 
But why wait? 
Dream is now. 
﻿1 Oh, you look pretty sharp tonight, Earl. 
visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com 
Going somewhere special? 
*** black and 75th. 
Who knows what the night will bring? 
Well, here's a twenty. 
Can you break this the way you just broke my heart? 
Pop-pop. 
Look at all this. 
People really tipped us well tonight. 
Yeah, well, don't get used to it. 
Thanksgiving is almost here, and as soon as people realize how much money they have to spend on holiday gifts, their wallets snap tighter than Kim Kardashian's legs after the wedding check cleared. 
I've always loved this time of year spiced pumpkin lattes, bringing my winter furs out, then bringing my winter furs to the dry cleaner's to get the red peta paint out. 
For me, it was jumping into a pile of leaves and finding a used condom. 
What's up, children of the corn? 
I will stay tonight and decorate diner for American holiday of Thanksgiving. 
Wow. I'm surprised you got 
the right holiday decorations. 
Last month, you put out Easter bunnies for Yom Kippur. 
So many Jewish holidays, I cannot Wikipedia them all. 
What, like I don't got a life? 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  visit tvshowslatest.blogspot.com 
My father and I had a very special Thanksgiving tradition every year. 
Oh, let me guess. 
You'd fly someplace like the Bahamas, lay by the pool, and he'd light other people's stolen money on fire? 
No. We'd rent out 
the Waldorf Astoria ballrooms and feed the homeless. 
Don't look at me right now. 
And after, we'd fly down to our home in St. Barts 
for two weeks. 
Okay, you can look at me again. 
I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria once beautiful hotel. 
$50 for a hamburger? 
For that money, it should eat me first. 
Okay, ready to go? 
Han, if you'd really like to do something in the diner to honor the spirit of Thanksgiving, you can open your doors and feed the homeless. 
Yeah, put your money where your cornstalk is. 
Caroline and I will work for free. 
Isn't it enough that when I see them on the street, I smile and pretend to fumble for change? 
No, it isn't. 
You can afford to open the diner for one night. 
You can't put a price tag on those kind of emotional rewards. 
Yes, I can. 
$18 for 16-pound turkey, and I will need many of them. 
There--price tag. 
Here, I will pay for turkeys. 
Jeez, dude, where'd you get that? 
I sell cigarettes from New Hampshire to schoolkids in New York. 
It is a good profit and beautiful drive. 
I love the leaves. 
All right. 
I'm feeling y'all. 
I'll bring the pie. 
My mother used to make the best chocolate pie. 
I remember one time she got so mad at this white woman she worked for, she took this chocolate pie into the bathroom No, hold up. 
That was from the help. 
I know it's not Burberry like we're used to, but I'm telling you, used moving blankets are gonna be in this year. 
Who's a trendsetter? 
We're really lucky November is so warm. 
Another thing I'm giving thanks for this Thanksgiving global warming. 
I think the three remaining polar bears would disagree. 
Max, it's time to teach me how to bake. 
Okay, well, if we're doing that, first I have to go get baked. 
I'm serious. 
It's the beginning of the holiday season, and with all the potential Christmas cupcakes and festive gift baskets, you're gonna need as much help as you can get. 
Festive holiday gift baskets? 
No way. 
I'm not into all that crap. 
Oh, no. Are you gonna be 
one of those, "I am too cool to believe in the wonders of Christmas" type of bitches? 
I am so many types of bitches, I've lost count. 
And the only wonder of Christmas I'm aware of is... 
I wonder how you're gonna keep up that attitude through Christmas this year. 
Why, because this is my first holiday without any money? 
Uh, yeah. 
Money isn't what makes the holidays special, Max. 
Uh, yeah. 
The holidays are totally about money. 
It's about spending money to buy things to stuff into the giant black sucking hole in the center of each of us that reminds us life is hard and then we die. 
And that's my Christmas card. 
Max, I'm aware this holiday season will be challenging, will I miss my 20-foot Christmas tree decorated by ten gay men? Yes. 
Will I miss those ten gay men outing my cousin Steven before he was ready? No. 
My holiday spirit is bigger than my money. 
So come on, teach me how to bake. 
We only have a couple weeks. 
Fine. Pour a cup of milk 
into the mixer. 
This will be fun. 
When I was little, I used to make my father cakes in my easy-bake oven. 
My easy-bake oven was repossessed. 
So, um, speaking of your father, are you doing okay? 
I mean, this is a hard time of year for people who have feelings, and just... 
With your father in prison, how are you doing? 
I'm doing great. 
I actually just found out that since it's Thanksgiving, they're allowing me to come see him for the first time. 
Well, that excitement will probably taper off after the full-body cavity search. 
I don't know. I might like it. 
It's been a while since I've had any cavities searched. 
All right. Pour the milk, slut. 
One cup milk. 
There, how's that? 
Good. 
Now into the mixer. 
There, how was that? 
Uh-uh. We're not playing 
"Rich girl gets a trophy every time she does something normal" Just cover the bowl with the towel so it doesn't splash out, and turn it on. 
Oh, it's not plugged in. 
Oh. Right. 
No, not without the towel! 
Christmas comes but once a year, and I think it just did. 
+ Wow. These high-end mixers 
are a lot of money. 
I thought if we came to a big department store, there'd be a lot of them, and the prices would be better. 
We can't afford these. 
How much did you think they'd be? 
I don't know. 
I guess I'm not used to looking at prices. 
I usually just point, pout, and it's purchased. 
Yeah, I had a version of that, only it was more like, point, and when they look the other way, stuff steaks down your pants and run. 
Come on, there has to be a mixer here we can afford. 
There is. 
Here. 
A $5 spoon? 
That's what we can afford? 
Yeah, if we put it on layaway, work hard for a few years. 
I'm used to being poor around your stuff, but not around stuff that I want. 
What happened to all your "money's not important" holiday spirit now? 
Max, it feels like you want me to be depressed about the holidays. 
No, no. I'm just saying 
that it's okay for you not to be all up and everything around me if you're not feeling it. 
It's all right to let your dark side out. 
Come to the dark side. 
Oh, my God. 
Look, they're hiring elves. 
Why would I go to the dark side when I could go to Santaworld? 
Let's go get in line. 
I've always loved Santaworld. 
Me too, as a David Sedaris story, not as an actual real-life option. 
Come on. 
If we get hired, we could use our employee discount to get one of the really good cake mixers. 
 And then it'd be like it came from Santa! 
Come on, Max, we'd be great elves. 
I have the holiday spirit. 
You're great with kids. 
And we're both so desperate for money, we'll wear other people's tights. 
Max, I've been coming to this store at Christmastime with my father since I was little. 
I'd get all dressed up in my fanciest winter coat and hat and then stand in line to see Santa with my hands in my muff. 
And they didn't throw you out? 
There is nothing Christmas-y about this hallway. 
It looks like the place Santa sends promiscuous elves to get the results of their S.T.D. test. 
Okay, that's the kind of comment that almost got us knocked out of the first round. 
You're lucky I edited your application. 
Why, what was so bad? 
You requested to work in Santa's sex toy shop. 
Max, that's not even a thing. 
Tell that to my candy-cane-shaped vibrator. 
Max! 
I call it "Santa's big helper." 
Please try and get into the holiday spirit. 
I know. If we get hired, 
we'll go right home and watch Miracle on 34th Sstreet. 
It'll be a miracle on 34th Street if we make it out of the bottom of this slave ship without elf scurvy. 
Hi. 
I couldn't help but overhear you mention Miracle on 34th Street. 
That's my absolute favorite Christmas movie. 
Mine too! 
My second favorite is it's a wonderful life. 
Mine too! 
I've got Schindler's List on Blu-Ray. 
 Hi. I'm Mary. 
 I'm Caroline. 
Hi. I'm Mary. 
It's cool. 
We don't need to talk. 
That's Max. She's kind of 
a Grinch about Christmas. 
Oh, like my brother Patrick He's always teasing me about loving Christmas. 
He calls me "Mary Christmas." 
   Get it? 
It's 'cause my name is Mary. 
I can't help it. 
It's my favorite time of year. 
 Mine too. 
 Yo. 
Disconnect before it's too late. 
Don't be so cynical. 
Especially Christmas eve. 
It's an O'Brien family tradition. 
All seven of my sisters and brothers we line up on the staircase in our brand-new Christmas PJs and have our picture taken. 
Bitch is 30. 
It's my father. 
Hi, daddy. You'll never guess 
where I am right now applying for a job at Santaworld. 
No, it's not depressing at all. 
The man's in prison, and he thinks this is depressing. 
Oh. Are you sure? 
It's really not that far. 
Okay. If that's what you want. 
Call me on Thanksgiving. 
Love you. 
He thought about it and doesn't want me to come. 
He said he can't face having me see him in there. 
 You okay? 
 Fine. 
Quiet, please, people. 
I have an announcement. 
Everyone in this corridor has been chosen to be an elf. 
Mazel. 
Yay, we're elves. 
Report to work at 3:00 A.M. 
the morning of Black Friday. 
Ooh! 
This is so exciting! 
 Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la  Okay, well... 
 I'll see you both then. 
 Okay, Mary. 
Great, 3:00 A.M. 
you, me, and definitely-a-Virgin-Mary. 
+ Good night. Get home safely. 
Ooh. Maybe I should not 
have said that to homeless. 
That is it. 
2:00 A.M. 
Freebie Thanksgiving dinner is now officially over. 
According to my calculations, we served over 300 turkey dinners and only had two knife fights. 
Thank you, Caroline. 
This experience taught me that rich or poor, home or homeless, we are all the same. 
Wait. Where's my wallet? 
They took my wallet, those dirty sons of Oh, here it is. 
Yes, we are all the same. 
Well, I have two things to say. 
First of all, I'm incredibly proud of us for spreading the spirit of Thanksgiving together. 
And secondly, someone left an adult diaper in this booth, and I am not dealing with that. 
What's with the sad face? 
You saw the bathroom? 
It's just--even though we fed the homeless, it doesn't feel like Thanksgiving without my father. 
But you made a lot of people happy here tonight, and you should feel pretty good about that. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Come on, elf. 
We better clear these tables. 
We have to be at Santaland in an hour. 
Why you have to be there in the middle of the night? 
Because it's Black Friday, and the doors open at 5:00 A.M. 
Yeah, we want to be there right on time to see the first person trampled to death by UGGs. 
We have to work all night and then all day tomorrow. 
 How are we gonna do this? 
 I got the answer right here. 
Max, I'm not doing cocaine. 
If we could afford cocaine, we could afford a mixer. 
Nine-hour energy shots, aka elf juice. 
I've never done these. 
Do they work? 
Millions of wired-off-their-asses college students can't be wrong. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Did you just drink that whole thing? 
Yeah, why? 
Nothing. 
I'm sure it's not too much. 
They suggest sipping it, but... 
Who are they? 
All right, we'd better go. 
We got to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
Oh, you should've sipped it. 
How do I look? 
Because I kind of feel like I look like a North Pole dancer. 
You actually look cute. 
You look good in red... 
And green red and green together. 
You can pull off anything. 
You're so beautiful. 
 I don't tell you that enough. 
 Whoa! 
Whoa, slow down, speed racer. 
I know. I can't stop talking. 
What was in that stuff you gave me? 
I don't know. 
The ingredients are in Spanish. 
Well, my corazon is beating muy rapido. 
Okay, and why aren't you in your elf costume yet? 
Because I was talking to those people over there, and there's a chance a slight chance, but a chance I could get moved to the strolling Christmas carolers. 
I overheard their ethnic mix is short a token blond. 
And I'm blond, baby! 
Forget it. You got me into 
the underbelly of the elf beast, and you are not bailing on me. 
But those period costumes are so much prettier. 
I will knock you from here to Rudolph's house if you abandon me. 
We are in this together. 
Now go get your bells on. 
Okay, I didn't want to tell you this because it's, well, gross, but the last elf who had the tights they gave me, well, let's just say her little lady elf friend visited unexpectedly. 
Ew. 
Talk about a period costume. 
You're right. It's disgusting. 
I can't do this anymore. 
I'm leaving. I don't want 
to do this anymore. 
I feel tired and wired at the same time. 
This was an awful, awful, awful, awful, awful idea! 
All right, calm down! 
Jeez, you're like a Christmas crack monkey. 
Look, we are not going anywhere, okay? 
You got me all elfed up, and now we need these jobs. 
So just go talk to someone and tell them why you need a new pair of tights. 
I can't. It's embarrassing. 
Look, either you ask her, or you rip out the crotch and risk showing six-year-olds your winter wonderland. 
Now I'm sad. 
You, the one with the dark hair,  I need you to come with me. 
 Where? 
And is there a drug test involved? 
Change of plans. 
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus. 
The other one had to leave blamed menopause. 
Menopause, please. 
I had my uterus yanked out on my lunch hour, and I was back at my desk by 2:00. 
Follow me... 
Unless, uh, you don't want that extra $2 an hour. 
Oh, no. You are not leaving 
me here alone when I'm crashing on elf juice. 
If I can't be an old-timey singer, you can't be Mrs. Claus. 
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm throwing you under the sled, sister. 
That extra $2 an hour will bring us closer to the really good mixer. 
And the way my life is going, this might be my only chance to be married to a rich guy. 
I'd double-check those tights if I were you. 
+ Ugh. 
These tights suck. 
Hi. Hi, elf. 
I just got assigned to the front of the line with you. 
Oh, crap. 
It's me, Mary. 
"Mary Christmas." 
You know, like... 
 My brother Patrick always says. 
 Yeah, you said that. 
Look at how cute we look...Jingles! 
I just named you Jingles. 
Get it? 
'Cause of all your bells. 
Oh, listen... 
Ah, this is my number-one favorite Christmas song. 
Ooh! What's your favorite 
Christmas song? 
Silent night. Get it? 
'Cause I want you to be silent. 
What's the matter with you? 
You're acting like an elfhole. 
Oh, hello, children! 
Who's next to see my husband, Santa? 
I am so mad at you right now. 
Oh-ho-ho! 
Uh, hold on, children. 
Mrs. Claus is just 
having an issue with one of her elf employees. 
What are you doing? 
What's wrong with you? 
You abandon me on Christmas the day after my father abandons me on Thanksgiving? 
You have balls. 
Christmas balls... 
Like on Santa's tree... 
Or a Hanukkah bush. 
Look, I've got my own problems, okay? 
Santa is kind of hands-y. 
And you leave me here with this one when I'm coming down the bad side of nine-hour energy mountain? 
I don't know what's at the bottom, but so far, not the miracle on 34th Street I was hoping for. 
 Well, elf  Her name is Jingles. 
One more word, Mary, seriously. 
Listen, Bipolar Express, you need to jingle all the way up that mountain, because all these kids are looking at us. 
Hello! 
 You got your list for Santa? 
 Yep. Got it right here. 
Well, he's waiting for you, so go right ahead in. 
 Yay, let's go! 
  Hi. 
Oh, you look so pretty in your hat and your coat. 
Thank you very much. 
I used to have a coat like that. 
But she gave it to a reindeer because he was very cold. 
Oh, you have your list for Santa? 
Let's see what you want. 
 Ooh, a pretty doll... 
 Had it. 
 An easybake oven... 
 Had it. 
 A Barbie dream house. 
 Oh, had that, too. 
Had all those things, and now I have nothing  nothing to stick in my big hole. 
 Okay. 
 Jingles, what are you doing? 
 Tell them, Max. 
No, no. I'm not Max. 
I'm Mrs. Claus 
Mrs. Beyonce Claus 
and I'm married to Santa. 
No, tell them what you told me that it's all just stuff we buy to stick in our big holes. 
I've been married for 50 years. 
I don't even think about holes anymore. 
Why is she talking to children about holes? 
 I'll get her. 
 Okay. 
 Caroline  No, Max, you were right. 
They should know the truth. 
Mrs. Claus, have a little, 
uh, elf control. 
Jingles, come into my little house. 
No, Max. They should know. 
There is no miracle on 34th Street, and it's not such a wonderful life. 
If it were, I wouldn't be standing here in crotchless tights in the middle of Santaland, with a father in prison, too broke to buy a mixer. 
Stop it, you're gonna ruin Christmas. 
Christmas is all about money. 
If you want stuff from Santa, you got to buy it, because there is no Merry Christmas! 
Get her out of here now. 
And you, put your knees together! 
I hope I didn't ruin Christmas  for all those sweet children. 
 No, you didn't. 
All they saw was a crotchless elf freaking out. 
But "Mary Christmas" will never recover. 
They'll find her in her studio apartment in two weeks hung from the chimney with care. 
Well, this is all kind of your fault. 
You told me to come to the dark side. 
I just told you to get in touch with your feelings. 
I didn't think you'd turn into Darth Caroline. 
Once I went there, I couldn't get back. 
Yeah, and chugging that elf juice didn't help. 
It wasn't just the drink. 
Before those presents came crashing down on me, reality did. 
I have no money and a father in prison who didn't even want to see me on Thanksgiving. 
Yeah, well, there are a lot of people way worse off than you. 
Yes, your father's in prison, but at least you have one and you know where he is. 
And you have a home and a job. 
And you have a freaking horse. 
So... 
Happy holidays. 
It is a wonderful life. 
You're right. I am so lucky. 
Well, since right now is the closest to the Christmas spirit we're probably gonna get, Santa wanted me to give you your Christmas present now. 
It's our new mixer. 
We're gonna old-school it. 
Aw, you spooned me. 
I feel bad. 
I didn't get you anything. 
Max, you got me everything. 
Before you, I was living on a subway, and now look... 
I'm living near a subway. 
So did you buy this? 
No, it's from Santa. 
Jingles, did you steal this? 
Yeah. 
I grabbed it when they were throwing us out. 
Wow, Caroline Channing. 
You keep this up, and you won't have to ask permission to visit your father in prison. 
But I did give $2 of our cupcake-fund money to the Salvation Army Santa. 
So God bless us, everyone! 
It's a wonderful life! 
It's times like this I really miss Darth Caroline.

How could ketchup get this hard? 
You just hold it in your hand like this, and say You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had. 
Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it. 
Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage. 
No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery. 
120 million dollars. 
Fine. If we win, I will get an eighth of my trust fund back. 
Come on. Now, who's got our ticket? 
I've got the ticket. I put it here. 
I figured it's for everybody else gets lucky. 
By the way, if we win, I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk. 
Also put a soda fridge in my garage for show. 
Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win? 
Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can, and set me up with some kind of  Hugh Hefner  situation. 
Here we go, for the big money. 
Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription. 
We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine. 
And the first number isÂ¡Â­6! 
And the second number is 47. 
Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair. 
Oh, can't wait Me and you handing out free cupcakes stuck between hipsters selling crochet iPad sleeves and salt peppers and salt pepper shakers. 
We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing. 
One person eats it and spreads it around their friends. 
So we are herpes. 
Hello, Sophie. 
If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes. 
Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limo over me. 
Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here. 
Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together. 
Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes? 
Won't you scutter your little butt over there and get me the menu the way you are supposed to? 
Hey, Max, Caroline. 
Come see me in my booth. 
Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window? 
What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines? 
I grew up reading Cosmo. 
I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones. 
It's the nipples, the end. 
I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow. 
We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair. 
We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair? 
Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business. 
And you can't spell "focus" without "us". 
Or FU. 
Hello, Sophie. 
Hello, Oleg. 
So, do you miss the sex? 
Oh, you know what? We should go. 
No. We are having a conversation here. 
And besides, the sex was not that good. 
Oh, it was that good. 
It wasn't that good. 
Please, I beg you. Let us go. 
You can go. I'm kind of into it. 
Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey. 
So why are you still standing there giving me those sad, cow eyes in that brown velure. 
Because it's a good look on me. 
And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here because you miss the sex. 
I miss summers in Minsk. 
I miss smoking in hospitals. 
But I don't miss the sex. 
Fine, then. What would you like to eat? 
I'll have my usual sausage. 
Ok, ding. It's ready. 
Max's homemade cupcakes. 
Max's delicious homemade cupcakes  Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes.  Max. 
come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair? 
I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes. 
Hi! 
I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral. 
Hey Dutch girl, why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke. 
I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized denim. 
Max, please. We are all business woman here. 
Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads. 
Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out. 
We've only been in business eight months. 
Heidi, how long have we been funneling? 
Everyday 24-7 for the past three months. 
And we already have a booth. 
Yeah we do. 
I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel. 
Actually we put the fun in the funnel. 
See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun". 
Or FU. 
Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind. 
Max's homemade cupcakes. 
Take this! 
See? Success! 
Scaring people into participating isn't success. 
It's Scientology. 
Calling Sophie we're taking that job. 
You'd better have a good reason you're late, because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair. 
I do. 
So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet, I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull. 
So after I thoroughly washed my hands, I know they never really come off though, right? 
Off your soul, I mean. 
I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job. 
And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite. 
60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top. 
Buttercream? 
This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner. 
I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy. 
Why? Is your business partner on a show of Nicklodeon? 
Look I don't do buttercream. 
Buttercream is a bitch. 
If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage. 
Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us, cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner. 
That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach. 
Oh, Peach is fine with it. 
Why would Peach be fine with it? 
Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five but that didn't happen and I got thrown. 
Peach is the connection I used to get us the party. 
You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job? 
I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us 
and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance. 
No way I'm not comfortable with this. 
Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable. 
It's the way you grow. 
No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods. 
Max Max. 
Max Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams. 
You mean Americans? 
I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk. 
No problem cause that's what waitresses do and apparently that's all we'll ever be. 
What? 
I have to prove the sex was not that good. 
Oleg on the food? 
Don't say it like that, That ham was already glaced before we go there. 
So I am guessing you are back together? 
Oh no no, the sex was not that good. 
Oh, it was that good. 
I went to get Mayo, and it all happened so fast. 
Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea. 
Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment, but I would like it on the record: I'm not a willing accomplice. 
So what is going on here? 
Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake. 
This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar? 
Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation? 
It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog, I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever? 
And original. 
I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog, we both have blogs and we both have babies. 
Only her babies are adopted from Africa. 
She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery. 
About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her. 
Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me. 
Yea, here is the thing. Thank you, 
but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor. 
I'm not comfortable asking to do that. 
But I did it for you. 
And now you will do that for me. 
And Max this has to go swimmingly which is a new word I just learned. 
So you are saying I can't get out of it? 
I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it. 
Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing? 
Fine. 
Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes, ain't no drama going on in that box! 
Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile? 
What? Are you planning to never talk to me again? 
You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking. 
That's true, my brother is deaf, not from birth, from firecrackers. 
Relax, we still have time. 
Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk. 
The buttercreams are not gonna melt. 
 Some people just like to create nonverbal drama.  En huh. 
Attention passengers. 
 There is an obstruction up on the track ahead.  No. 
I bet someone jumped in front of the train. 
Oh my God, what a tragedy, the buttercream! 
Attention passengers. 
We apologize for this delay. 
There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead. 
It's totally like a body. 
They can't get it off and what not. 
We should be moving shortly. 
What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago. 
How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose. 
Still? Still not talking? 
Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither. 
What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too. 
And she just keeps talking. 
I know, right? 
We probably hit the body. 
So it is all up in the wheeling and what not. 
Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there, I'm going to lose my babysitting job. 
 Are we babysitters or bakers?  I was talking to him. 
Stay out of this. 
Nina, if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes, so we all don't starve. 
No one is touching these cupcakes. 
Our entire future is riding on these mothers. 
I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell. 
Miss, you are making things so much worse in here. 
Are you telling me you don't smell that? 
It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear. 
This train is out of service. 
We are approximately two blocks away from the next station. 
We're gonna have to take you on foot. 
Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety. 
We are gonna walk? 
They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels? 
Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first. 
My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees. 
If I faint and fall down, the others rats will like eat me and what not. 
Rats? Max, are there rats? 
It's a subway. The floor is made of rats, 
but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles. 
Thank you for responding. 
Hold up. 
I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this, 
the rats would be the better option for you. 
We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it. 
How are your cupcakes? 
They are still holding together. 
Like us. We are still holding together. 
Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk. 
Folks, It's a bit of gap here. 
A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap? 
Because people need reasonably price basics. 
I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over. 
Hey miss, you are next. 
I put the line on, just grab it. 
You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel? 
Hey, just take these. 
Careful, sir, it's buttercream! 
I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes. 
Thank you. Right. Thank you. 
Ok, miss, you next. 
Hand me over the cupcakes and jump. 
I can't. I'm terrified. 
What if I fall? The rats will eat me. 
I can never come back from that. 
Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No. 
"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?" 
"Well, it's a long story." 
Girl, if you fall that third rail, it will fry you way before the rats get there. 
Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out. 
If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth. 
Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step. 
Hold these. 
Come on, I'm right here. 
I took the step, now you have to take the step. 
That's right. You did. I do. 
Here we go. 
Back up everybody. Yea! 
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go. 
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go. 
Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh! 
I saw a rat. We made eye contact. 
You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off. 
Sir, that is never going to happen. 
We are in Manhattan. 
I may be under it but I'm still in it. 
And when they pull out my half-eaten body, I will be wearing my heels. 
Mariah? 
Why? I only have one. 
What are you gonna do? 
Jump back over and do something and whatnot? 
Constance, we're sorry, we are late. 
I don't wait. I don't wait for anything. 
I already have the iPhone 8. 
Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway. 
Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now! 
Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look? 
Like they all had unprotected sex with each other? 
Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up. 
 Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.   There can't be. 
Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing. 
That is not attractive at all. 
Is... is that what food looks like? 
Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you. 
There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up. 
It's not a problem, we can fix it. 
I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser. 
And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch. 
I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term. 
You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these? 
Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father. 
Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream. 
I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you. 
But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either. 
Right, Peach? 
But I love Max. 
She's been with me since I bought the twins. 
I can't live without her. 
You are never coming to another one of my parties. 
Max, you're fired. 
It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful. 
Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch". 
And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted. 
Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good? 
You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it. 
Ok, fine. The sex was that good, 
as was the ham. 
It was that good because it was more than just sex. 
It was love. 
Oh... it is not love. 
Oh, it is love. 
Oh... it is not love. 
It was dirty, disgusting sex. 
Yes, it was. 
Oleg, do you really love Sophie? 
Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her. 
Her lips will be mine. 
Wait, you never kissed her? 
Not on the lips of her face. 
But that day will come. 
Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this, but that is pretty freaking romantic. 
I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black". 
Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"? 
You think her name is "Max African American"? 
Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins? 
They're in the car, don't worry, I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe. 
Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance. 
Pretended? That felt pretty real. 
Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them. 
Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back. 
That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow, 
and then everyday. 
Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow, or any other day. 
We have to focus on our business. 
Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this? 
No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right? 
You gotta take a step. 
Well, then how about just for another year? 
By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves. 
No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can. 
Oh, Max, I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English. 
Bye, Max. 
Wow, good for you, good for us. 
Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place. 
You have another job. You work for yourself. 
You're your own boss. 
My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion. 
﻿1 Max, can you watch my tables while I run to the restroom? 
I already am. 
I've been watching model girl pretend she's eating for 30 minutes. 
Oh, she's nice. 
She always tips on what she would've eaten. 
Guess what, everyone? 
I have a secret. 
You're a woman trapped in a man's body? 
No. 
You're a man trapped in a woman's body? 
You're a little boy trapped in a little girl's body? 
I am a man in a man's body. 
We're not talking about your night life. 
I have discovered something when going over the employee applications. 
Okay, perhaps I never worked at the Waldorf Astoria, but I did work with this guy, Waldorf, in Astoria. 
It's not you. Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday. 
Why wouldn't I know that? 
She tells me everything about her life. 
I know so much about her cycle, I'm feeling pressure to impregnate her. 
I can do that for you. 
It's weird. 
Why wouldn't she want to celebrate her birthday? 
She celebrates everything. 
Heads up, everybody. 
I just refilled the paper towels. 
Who's a team player? What, what? 
 ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  2 Broke Girls - S01E18 And the One-Night Stands February 27, 2012 Max. 
You know what we have to do. 
Aw, man. I knew this day would come. 
All right, what's the least amount I can do to keep my job? 
Just tell me when it's over. 
And when it starts. 
It's time to talk about Caroline's birthday. 
You have to throw her a party. 
I'd rather you just have your tiny way with me. 
I don't like birthdays. 
I don't even know when mine is. 
My mom narrowed it down to a two-week window in June. 
But you are Caroline's BFF. 
And it is BFF's job to throw friend a party. 
Han, I don't have enough money to throw a party. 
I don't even have enough money to throw a baseball. 
You have money. You be her BFF. 
I already have a BFF-- Jamarcus. 
And my last birthday, he threw me a sick surprise party. 
You must think BFF stands for "barely freaking friends", because there's no way you're down with someone named Jamarcus. 
Oh, really? 
Then why did we exchange ATM pin numbers? 
Oh... 
I'll just crop that, and we'll be good to go. 
Max, Edwin's ready to show us the design for our new website. 
Come see it. 
Dude, you and the webmaster have been talking "business" every day for a week. 
Is something going on there? 
Shouldn't the web be mastered by now? 
It's strictly business. 
All right, but it's costing us $200. 
Might as well get something out of it. 
Maybe let him browse your Yahoo? 
Looks like he might have a big ol' hard drive with a lot of ram. 
Yeah, he's cute, but I don't want a relationship right now. 
And I don't do one-night stands. 
All right, so don't stand. Lay down. 
That's not me the next morning, doing the walk of shame. 
I always see those girls with their messed-up sex hair, carrying their heels, clutching their coats to hide last night's outfit. 
Going into Kinko's to use Google maps so you can figure out where you are. 
You really put the "ho" in "Kinko." 
Oh. Sorry, Sophie. 
We're closed. 
Oh, no. I'll be quick. 
I just want a cupcake to go. 
I'm on my way to 24 hour fitness. 
Ja, and I put it on the cupcake holder on the treadmill. 
Uh, Max, my town car is parked out front and I was wondering if you wanted me to wait for you and Caroline to give you a ride back to our building. 
Oh, no. It's okay. 
We still have to clean up and take the garbage out. 
Oh. 
Oh, looks like the garbage is taking itself out. 
The game continues. 
Here is my number. 
I invite you to call me when you realize what a catch I am. 
Or any time you are drunk and willing. 
Max, I'm going to need the doggy bag as well. 
Not for the cupcake. 
To puke in. 
So I'll get this finalized, and then I'll stop by the diner tomorrow so you can sign off on the layout before we go live. 
This is so exciting. 
Oh, wait, Edwin. Shoot. 
I forgot to show you the new pricing chart. 
It's cool, I can draft it up right now and upload it when I get home. 
Yeah, webmaster. You work pretty fast. 
But I bet you can work slow, too. 
And really fast again. 
I can be done in a minute. 
Ooh, not what you want to hear. 
Max. 
It's fine. We can wait. 
You know what? You stay here. 
I have to go to the store and pick up stuff for your my what? 
Your cupcake business that you're making me do with you. 
Get home safe. 
Um, hey, where do you live, Edwin? 
Hell's kitchen. 
Oh, cool. 
You're going to want to take the "c" down, transfer to the "l," and if you get lost, there's a Kinko's on 6th and 14th. 
That's embarrassing. Max was just trying to 
yeah, I work on complicated web programs. 
I think I cracked that code. 
She wants us to hook up. 
Yeah. I'm sorry. 
Why are you sorry? 
That's all I've been thinking about. 
Yum, yum. 
Oh, my God. 
They are so hot. 
Don't give me that look. 
Oleg. 
Caroline. 
What are you doing here? 
What are you doing here? 
I live here, and I'm just coming out from going to get coffee. 
It was delicious. 
I drank every bit of it. 
Outside. That's why I don't have a cup. 
But you're wearing the same outfit from last night. 
You're wearing the same outfit from last night. 
And you have messed-up sex hair. 
You have messed-up sex hair. 
Webmaster? 
Sophie? 
She called me up and we made hand love. 
But I thought Sophie hated you. 
Well, she doesn't hate my hand. 
But you cannot tell anyone. 
That was her one condition. 
That and a copy of my recent blood tests signed by a medical professional. 
Deal. 
And you can't tell anyone about me, either. 
Especially Max. 
I'd never hear the end of it. 
Deal. 
Pinky swear? 
Actually, never mind. 
I don't know where your fingers have been. 
I just told you where they've been. 
Max I'm so excited for this party. 
I wore my loose clothing so I can dance all night. 
God, I cannot take this party pressure. 
I'm just going to go in the back and run a can opener across my wrist. 
Oh, Max. I'm sure you did a great job. 
You know, as long as you have a DJ, some champagne, and a psychic. 
No, no, and no. 
I got some balloons, a hummus tray, and possibly Earl. 
He still hasn't confirmed. 
Oh. 
You don't need psychic to know that this is going to be a horrible, horrible party. 
Well, thank God Caroline has new boy toy. 
She might not mind as much. 
What are you talking about? 
Yeah, I saw them kissing in front of the diner last night. 
Yeah, I sat there and watched for an hour. 
They were really going at it, hot and heavy. 
You know, like the Showtime network in the good old days. 
Oh, great. 
Now I have to invite him to the party, too? 
I only got a six-pack of Capri Suns, so people are going to have to share. 
Congratulations, it's official. 
Our website is now live. 
Congratulations, it's official. 
You're a whore. 
I hear you got your Kinko's card punched. 
What? 
Don't "what" me. 
I know you hooked up with the webmaster. 
Pick up. 
Oleg, you told Max? 
What's happening? 
Our deal's off. 
Oleg had sex with Sophie last night. 
No... 
It wasn't sex. Just hand stuff. 
Yeah, and nothing above the waist. 
I'm a lady. 
I got all hot and bothered watching Caroline and big Han. 
Okay... 
You know, I really think this is between Caroline and me. 
You mean between Caroline, you, and your strippers. 
Strippers? 
I have seen this man in a strip club. 
Han, you were in a strip club? 
Earl took me. 
Damn it, Han. 
You're going to sell me out after I spotted you $100 in ones. 
You went to Spreaders without me? 
Why would you take Han to a strip club? 
Yeah, is his lap even big enough for a dance? 
Earl, I'm so disappointed in you. 
That's it. I'm not going to your party. 
What party? 
Damn it, Earl! 
It's supposed to be a surprise for her birthday. 
Who told you it was my birthday? 
Han. 
Damn it, Han! 
I didn't want a party and I don't want to celebrate my birthday this year. 
Well, too bad, because your BFF is throwing you a big blow-out. 
Oh, Max. Now I feel bad. 
You feel bad now, wait till you see the party. 
Caroline's birthday. Woot, woot. 
Thanks, but you don't have to say that after everything. 
Max... 
I know you had limited budget, but music is free. 
Yeah, well, I'm a douche. 
Speech! 
Speech! 
I can't carry this party much longer. 
Okay, I'd like to say something. 
Wait, wait. 
Can't we wait till we cut the cake? 
Cake? 
People are still doing that? 
Yes. Our livelihood depends on it. 
There's only one party as bad as this one. 
That's the Donner Party. 
And even they had better food. 
I'd like to say happy birthday to a very pretty lady who I just had the pleasure of meeting, and I think I'm going to be seeing a lot more of her. 
Aw. 
I'll go get us some more drinks. 
Okay. 
Get rid of him. 
What? 
It was a one-time thing. 
I thought you weren't that kind of girl. 
I realized it had almost been a year since I had sex, and I decided I rather not be that kind of girl. 
But I don't want a relationship. 
Hey, I get it. Hit it and quit it. 
 hit it, don't babysit it  Max, please. 
Fine. 
How am I going to make him go away? 
It's not going to take a lot to convince someone to leave this party. 
I'd like to ask everyone to raise their cocktail, but I can't. 
So raise your Capri to the sun... 
For a very special lady who I'm sure I will be seeing more of. 
Get rid of him. It was a one-time thing. 
So was that the worst party you've ever been to? 
That was the worst party anyone's ever been to. 
So with the webmaster, how was the sex? 
Pretty good. 
But then he did that thing where he pretended he was going to choke me. 
When did guys start doing that? 
I don't know, but if I knew that was his thing, I would've asked him to choke me at the party. 
How did you get rid of him? 
What did you say? 
Did you let him down gently? 
No, I told him to hit the pike. 
It's a one-night stand. Guys get that. 
So that's it? He wasn't upset? 
Guys don't care. 
One-night stands-- they come, they go. 
Literally. 
But what if he wants to see me again? 
Relax. 
It is not going to come back to haunt you. 
Unless you start feeling an itch... 
Or a kick. 
Well, thanks for dumping him. 
And for the... 
I'm going to go ahead and call it a party. 
I knew you wouldn't want me to use any of the cupcake money, and I was broke. 
So I guess I am your BFF your broke friend forever. 
Max, it really doesn't matter what you would've done. 
The only thing I really wanted for my birthday was to see my father. 
And he's in prison, so that didn't happen. 
I may not be a good BFF, I may not throw a great party, but I do know where to find a free bus to prison. 
Hey, everybody. 
We got a birthday girl onboard. 
Sit yo ass back down! 
See? Now we got a party. 
This is nice getting out of the city. 
Kind of reminds me of the ride to the Hamptons. 
Yo. 
This your first time on the bangbus? 
We call it the bangbus because everybody here gonna get banged. 
And in addition 'cause we're on a bus. 
Hmm, makes sense. 
Hey, I'm Shonda. 
I'm Max. This is Caroline. 
So you're all going for, like, conjugal visits? 
Pretty fancy term for getting shawshanked on a three-legged cot. 
Shawshanked. I like her. 
I like your hair. 
Did you just get back from Cancun? 
No, no. 
I saved up, and I got these done for my man. 
He says they make me look like Alicia Keys meets Ed Norton in American History X. 
How sweet. 
Ah, yo. What's your man in for? 
My man's in for possession of a sweet, sweet ass. 
He makes that joke every time. 
He's not my man, actually. He's my dad. 
Oh, so you're a freak. 
That's all right. I don't judge. 
You see a name tag on me that says "Judy"? 
Oh, look. We just passed a Carvel. 
What's a Carvel? 
Carvel ice cream. 
You know, Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss. 
Come on, how could you not know Carvel? 
They have them everywhere. 
Oh, wait. 
Is that that white trash ice cream? 
How dare you! 
It is not white trash. 
And I wouldn't be so high and mighty. 
You're on a free bangbus to a prison. 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't realize you had such a strong emotional connection to ice cream. 
Not to the ice cream. The ice cream cake. 
When I was ten, I asked my mom for a birthday party. 
She said yes but then flaked out and forgot to call anyone. 
I'm starting to understand why you don't like birthday parties. 
So after I waited on the porch for an hour, I'll stole 20 bucks from her purse, thumbed it out to Carvel, and bought myself a Fudgie the Whale cake. 
Ate the whole thing with a pink plastic spoon, and it was way better than any party ever could have been. 
I heard that. 
There ain't nothing better than Fudgie the Whale. 
I love the chocolate crunchies. 
Bitch, everybody love the damn chocolate crunchies! 
Hey, Shonda. Who are you here to see? 
Who's available? 
I'm just cracking wise. 
You know I'm here to see Squirm. 
Search her. 
Damn. Is it my turn again? 
Next. 
We're not on that list. We didn't call ahead. 
Leave it to me. 
I've gotten into every club I've ever wanted to get into. 
Hi. Caroline Channing plus one. 
I don't see you on the list. 
Really? That's weird. 
We should be on the list. 
We're always on the list. 
Max, we're not on the list. 
We're not? I'm going to kill my assistant. 
Oh, I know. 
It might be under Deangelo Jefferson. 
Come on, girls. Don't waste my time. 
I'd like to see a manager. 
There's no manager. 
It's a prison. 
Well, then who runs this place? 
Well, the Aryan brotherhood is getting pretty strong. 
This is such amateur hour. 
Give me 50 bucks for the door guy. 
Are you seriously trying to bribe an officer of the law while inside a prison? 
That's a federal offense. 
Is it? 
Probably. 
Look, I should have you thrown out for even suggesting it. 
We do not accept bribes. 
Okay, fine. 
I'll let you take your sweet time searching me on the way in. 
These two are clear to go through. 
Max, you can't do that for me. 
It's really for me. It's been a while. 
Woot, woot. 
I'm so excited to see my father after all this time. 
How do I look? 
You look good. How do I look? 
Do I still have that freshly felt-up glow? 
Well, that ginger over there thinks you look good. 
He's full-on staring at you. 
Well, I should hope so. 
If you can't get a dude in prison to check you out, it's time for a makeover. 
No, he's looking and nodding like he knows you. 
Never seen him before in my life. 
Max? 
Max Black? 
It's me, Irish. 
I don't know, dude. 
I think you got the wrong girl. 
Max, I could never forget that face. 
Trust me, you've never seen me before. 
Oh, damn! 
Oh, my God! 
That's you. 
So you do remember. 
Of course. 
Get rid of him. 
It was a one-night stand. 
See, they do come back to haunt you. 
Shirt on. 
Max, can you believe it? 
Of all the prisons in all the world, you walked into mine. 
It's kismet. 
I got rid of yours. You get rid of mine. 
Listen, Irish. It was a one-time thing. 
You're a guy. You get that. 
How could you say it's a one-time thing? 
I love you. 
I blew up that chipotle for you. 
Listen, I appreciate the ink, but I don't really believe in love, and truth be told, I'm not even a fan of Mexican food. 
Caroline Channing. This table. 
Max, we have to go. My dad's coming. 
Okay. Nice to see you, Irish. 
Your body looks sick. 
Max, hold on. 
I'm not going to tell you again to back up. 
Max, I'm not going to lose you twice. 
I said, back up! 
Don't tell me to back up. 
That's the love of my life. 
Come on, dude. Hit the pike. 
Calm down. 
Don't tell me to calm down! 
Visiting hours are over! Everybody out! 
No, no, no, wait! I can't leave. 
Damn! 
Oh, wait. There's my father. 
I can see him, he's just coming in. 
Oh, daddy. Daddy... 
Hi! 
Well, thank you very much, ladies. 
My man was barely in when I got pulled out. 
I would like to apologize to everyone for taking the bang out of the bus, but in my own defense, everyone here knows a little something about crazy guys. 
Sit yo ass back down! 
Max, sit down before you start another riot. 
I'm sorry. I blew it. 
I screwed up your chance to see your father. 
I screwed up your party. 
I even screwed up the easiest birthday thing to do, like get a cake. 
I'm a terrible BFF. 
It's okay. 
Really, it's fine. 
With the year I'm having, it's not like you could've made everything better just by getting me a cake. 
Well, no. Not just any cake. 
Just as good as I remember it. 
Best 40 bucks we ever spent. 
And this birthday turned out to be all right. 
I did get what I wanted. 
I got see my father. 
It was only for a second, but I saw him. 
And he saw me. So thank you. 
Yeah, and I got to see Irish. 
Think he might be the one that got away. 
Well, the one that got put away. 
You know, you and I are better than BFFs. 
We're BBFs. 
Bangbus friends. 
Here you go, Earl. 
Table 12 throwing down a credit card on a patty melt. 
They really need those eight airline miles? 
Where they going... New Jersey? 
Credit cards are the downfall of America. 
Well, credit cards and Kim Kardashian. 
I like her big ass as much as the next man, but don't go give the damn butt a franchise. 
Max, I can take a lot. 
Please keep your sex life to yourself. 
I handled it when I lost my fortune, and I handled it when I lost my fortune. 
You said that twice. 
Because I think it bears repeating. 
But this is too much. 
That couple that just left... 
a $50 check, a $1.47 tip. 
47 cents? 
Uh, I wasn't even aware they were still making pennies. 
I smiled and bent over backwards, giving them service... 
all for $1.47? 
This makes me the lowest-paid hooker in New York. 
All right, give me that check. 
I'll handle this. 
Hey! 
Was something wrong with the service my girl over here gave you? 
No. Tipping's an option. 
So is me spitting in your food. 
You might want to remember that the next time you leave a waitress pennies. 
I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
This was our first and last date. 
Sorry, dude. 
Looks like this little tip just lost you the chance to give her your little tip. 
Max, come in, sit down. 
There's something we have to talk about. 
This can't be about my drinking. 
I don't have the money to be a real alcoholic. 
Can you sit in that chair, please? 
I never sit in that chair. 
Well, today we're doing things differently... 
breaking our pattern. 
 Hold up. 
Did you join scientology? 
And I went to Starbucks and got you a coffee and a vanilla bear claw. 
A Bear Claw? Awesome! 
I'll sit anywhere you want. 
My life is not where I want it to be. 
That $1.47 tip 
was a wake-up call reminding me that life will always undervalue you if you let it. 
Yes, I've been knocked down, but now it's time to fight back and grab life by the balls. 
I don't know if life likes having its balls grabbed. 
Some guys do, but those are usually the ones who want you to spoon them. 
I'd like to explain my vision for our future by walking you through... 
My vision board. 
 Oh, no. 
 It's a simple tool. 
You're a simple tool. 
You start with a thin, white board... 
Your thin, white, and I'm bored. 
Keep going. 
I can do this all day. 
I have a Bear Claw in me. 
I've been making vision boards for years, and I always achieve my goals. 
And you think it's that crazy little board and not your father's billions? 
 Max, it works. 
You put up pictures and inspirational words of things you want in your life. 
See? I have success, 
a cupcake business, and a picture of a beautiful new bed. 
Ah, the ones at the Asylum look different than that, so don't get attached. 
Sleeping on that couch is holding me back. 
I never get a restful night's sleep, and I need a good nine hours. 
What you need is a good nine inches. 
That should be on your vision board. 
It is... on the back. 
Nice. 
Now, unless you're willing to switch the bedroom every other week... 
No, that sounds mormon. 
Then I want to install a murphy bed in here. 
The bed folds up against the wall during the day, so you'd still maintain your signature Williamsburg "I don't care about anything chic or nice" decor. 
Who's going to build it? 
'Cause it's not me. 
I'm already being taken advantage of at my babysitting job. 
Peach has me lugging things back and forth to help with the twins' first birthday party. 
I've been sorting through clown resumes for a week. 
Peach is throwing a birthday party? 
Did you ask her if we can cater the desserts? 
She hires fancy people with real companies. 
We're not a real business. 
See? This is what I'm talking about. 
You mock the vision board, but look... 
here it is, our cupcake shop. 
I don't think we can both fit in there. 
Max, you have to start imagining what our life can be. 
You deserve a cupcake shop, and I deserve a new bed. 
All you have to do is dream it. 
No, all you have to do is do it. 
And for you to build a Murphy bed, it'll take a miracle. 
So unless you have Jesus or Jesus on that board... 
Not going to happen. 
Who is it? 
It's Jesus... 
From Williamsburg hardware. 
We got your do-it-yourself Murphy bed. 
See how I made that happen? 
Vision. 
So which one of them has the nine inches? 
Guess what I did today? 
Jesus? 
What do you think? 
I think the bed still isn't built. 
No, but it's almost finished. 
Look... 
Notice anything different about me? 
I have answer. 
You had boob job. 
Your "b"s have turned into "c"s, and for that, I give you an "a." 
No, I had my uniform altered. 
Yes, life dealt me a bad uniform, but with a little vision, I can shape it the way it works best for me. 
That should be a tip in your inspirational book, which I'm guessing is called cutting pictures out of magazines isn't just for serial killers anymore. 
And this is exciting... look. 
The other really important thing I did today... 
made us business cards. 
Now you can give one to Peach and throw our hat into the party ring. 
You're her babysitter. 
You already have a connection. 
Yeah, a connection to her babies' asses. 
See? That's your limited vision. 
Plus, Peach is interviewing this gay guy who used to work for Martha Stewart. 
I mean, gay, Martha Stewart... 
we can't top that. 
Just give her the cards. 
We have to start somewhere. 
See? 
"Max's homemade cupcakes." 
And look... 
"Max Black, owner/baker." 
"Owner/baker"? 
That's pretty cool. 
See? There it is. 
It's real. 
But the name sucks a big one. 
"Homemade"... 
it sounds like homeschooled, like we're churning out cupcakes that aren't comfortable around other people. 
Or it sounds delicious. 
And the cupcake on the card has a cherry on it. 
My cupcakes don't have a cherry... 
haven't since I was 13. 
If you could really get under his shoulder blades... 
that's where he carries all his stress. 
Don't say your real thoughts. 
Don't say your real thoughts. 
Max, we're using our spa voice today. 
Use my spa voice? 
Okay. 
I can't afford this. 
I want you to make sure the twins drink lots of water after, you know, to flush out the toxins. 
Toxins? 
All they drink is breast milk. 
I can't be sure what the woman I buy that from puts in her body. 
We're all so tense about the birthday party. 
If everything isn't perfect, how will they live with the shame? 
Um, Peach, um... 
Speaking of the... the party, 
uh, I-I started this, um, thing, and it's probably dumb, but... 
I don't need it. 
Like, I'm fine. 
I don't need it. 
It's just more like... 
like a... like a... 
Favor. 
Um, but, uh, the thing is, there's the cards, so I was thinking may... 
"maybly"... 
"maybly"? What's that? 
It's not a word, right? 
 I was not saying a word. 
 I'm sorry. 
I'm done with whatever this is that you're doing. 
I have to go meet the Martha Stewart queen and hear his party pitch. 
Just remember, at 3:00, the twins have their spray tans. 
Well, that's exactly how I envisioned that. 
Let me see what you're drawing, Johnny. 
A rat with a civil war hat. 
Is that your comment on how politicians view soldiers? 
No, it's an actual rat I saw wearing a hat. 
See, when you tend bar till 4:00 a.m., 
you see a lot of weird stuff. 
And when you waitress till 2:00, you see a loser drawing a rat on a napkin. 
Now sign it, please. 
Hmm. 
You realize my art won't be worth anything till I'm dead? 
Why do you think I keep inviting you here to eat week after week? 
Question... 
how does it feel to be the owner of an original piece of napkin art worth roughly... 
Less than the worth of the napkin? 
Well, I got to get back to work. 
All right, bye. 
Pick up... table ten. 
I watch you over there. 
Much sexual tension with deadbeat bartender. 
He's not just a bartender. 
He's a street artist. 
And all I did was bite a piece of celery. 
When I think of all the times I asked you to bite my celery... 
And nothing. 
Okay, my side work's done, and my tables are all caught up. 
So, tell me, did you give Peach the card? 
No, I didn't. 
 Why? 
 It was like my mouth wouldn't let me do it. 
That's crazy. 
What's so hard about going up to Peach and saying, "good afternoon, Peach." 
"Exciting news... 
I started a cupcake business." 
"Here's our card." 
"Please pass them out to all your friends, and help us launch our exciting new business venture." 
"Thank you." 
That sounds needy, like when someone asks you to come to their one-woman show. 
"Somebody date-raped me, and I didn't think I'd live through it, but I did, and now I'm stronger, and, uh, still needy." 
There is nothing needy about having a quality product and wanting it out there. 
Look at Earl... he has a CD on display. 
Yeah, but he's cool about it. 
He doesn't get all late-night infomercial and shove them down people's throats. 
Earl? 
How many CDs have you sold at the diner? 
Well, in this current economy... 
It's been pretty light. 
 May I? 
 Mmhmm. 
Hi. 
You guys look like music lovers. 
This is the best saxophone CD you will ever hear... 
recorded by our cashier Earl Samson. 
He's played with all the greats... 
Coltrane, Hancock, even Bacharach. 
His music career derailed due to a heroin addiction, but now he's clean and sober and, at 83, still following his dream. 
Only $9.95 a copy. 
Who'd like one? 
Thank you! 
Earl, four CDs. 
Is any of that true? 
Nope. She even made up 
my damn last name. 
That girl can sell. 
Oh! Max... 
Will you come look at Brangelina? 
I think the spray-tan lady went a little too far. 
I wanted them to look tan, not foreign. 
A little lebanese, but that'll clear up in a day or two. 
I'm having the worst day. 
Jessica Seinfeld stole the Martha Stewart boy. 
I am so upset with her. 
I thought we were pretending to be friends. 
And now I have no one to do the desserts. 
 Hello, Peach, exciting news... 
I have a cupcake business. 
They're really good. 
Give these to your friends and help launch a new business or whatever. 
That's it. I did it. 
Boom! 
Okay, the bed still isn't built. 
But the mattress came, and it's so good. 
Oh, no... this is not okay. 
We're not keeping a mattress on the floor. 
We're poor, not crackheads. 
And you tricked me. 
I did my part, so you better get this bed done. 
Max, you gave Peach the cards. 
I'm so proud of you. 
What did she say? 
No. Shut it. Do it. 
Relax. The bed will be assembled 
and hidden in the wall by the end of the day, 'cause I decided to do what cute girls have been doing for centuries. 
I asked a guy for help. 
You called a guy? 
Oh, is he going to climb up your long blonde hair and rescue you from your murphy-bed tower? 
Wait. 
You don't know any guys. 
Who did you invite? 
 Johnny. 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
Eh, I don't want to see Johnny. 
I had a weird thing with him at the diner last night. 
I thought you guys were friends. 
I don't know what we are. 
He was fake interviewing me with a celery stalk... 
'Cause you're both grown-ups. 
And when he put it near my mouth, I thought he wanted me to bite it, so I... 
 You bit it? 
 I bit it! 
 That is weird and humiliating and hot. 
Yes, yes, and, yes. 
Call him right now! 
He can't come over here. 
Look around! 
I have his napkins hanging up everywhere. 
He'll think I'm dexter. 
Don't answer that. 
 Don't you... 
 Come on in, Johnny. 
Yes, I did it. 
I need a bed. 
You are so selfish! 
Yes, I'm selfish, and you're Dexter. 
So, quick... help me take down the napkins. 
Oh, god, there are so many! 
How come I never noticed how many there were before? 
I don't know. 
Same reason you didn't notice your father stealing everybody's money. 
Really? Really? 
Now when I'm helping you? 
You're right. 
We'll trash you later. 
Why don't you just ask him what the celery moment meant? 
I don't want to ask him. 
You don't want to ask anybody anything. 
It's not like the business cards. 
What am I going to say? 
"Good afternoon, Johnny." 
"Exciting news... I have started 
an oddly sexual celery-biting business." 
Be right there, Johnny! 
Yo. 
So I brought tools... 
per your request... 
and beer, I made an executive decision on. 
So that's what you do with my art. 
Just one, and I put it up there. 
She doesn't even like it... she's like, 
"why would anyone hang up stupid napkin art?" 
Right off my back. 
Had a couple of these on the subway. 
So here's the wood. 
You can't help her... 
she needs to learn a lesson about doing things for herself. 
She thinks we're her daddy, and we'll go back on our word, and she'll get a pony. 
Well, you can see why she'd think that. 
I'm going to see if the horse wants a beer. 
Hmm, maybe put my glasses on him... 
get crazy up in this piece! 
When you're out there, ask him what the celery meant. 
Get busy, princess. 
Daddy's got company. 
Well, little lady, I reckon a cowboy'd get used to a pretty sweet setup like this. 
It's a hard life out on the trails. 
Yeah, it's hard for my people, too, since you stole all our land and gave us blankets covered in smallpox. 
I do declare, I'm sorry for the disease blankets. 
But they did keep you warm, I bet, until they killed you, that is. 
"I do declare" is not cowboy. 
That's Southern Belle. 
I think you're looking for "darn tootin'" or "dag nab it." 
Cowboys did not say "dag nab it." 
Yeah, they did. 
"Someone done gone stole my horse, dag nab it." 
I think you're thinking "doggone it." 
No, "dag nab it"... cowboy. 
Do you really think you know cowboy better than me? 
Which one of us has a horse? 
Which one of us has assless chaps? 
Should I go inside and help Caroline? 
No. I'm sure she's doing just fine. 
Can I ask you something? 
Sure. 
When you put the sss... 
we should get on the horse! 
 Okay. 
 Yeah! 
Use three-inch lag screw to secure ledger board to wall studs "aboot" every 12 inches. 
Ooh! Your canadian voice is so dull, 
I can't understand a word you're saying. 
There's got to be a video with a better voice. 
"How to build a Murphy bed... Morgan Freeman." 
Interesting bit of information about horses... 
they hurt your balls. 
Yeah, mine hurt, too. 
You would think after all these years of riding a horse, man would have evolved to have his balls on top instead of underneath. 
Life would be so much easier. 
Well, yeah, but I don't see a lot of old-timey ladies wanting to get with the top balls. 
Are you thinking about the celery? 
No, I'm still thinking about my balls. 
Now I'm thinking about the celery. 
That was weird, right? 
Not weird, really... more, um, intense. 
Intense good or intense bad? 
Intense intense. 
Whoo. 
Whoa. Oh. Did I just grab your... 
yeah, I don't know. 
"Maybly." 
"Maybly"! 
That's not a word, right? 
 I should... 
 I got to get down. 
Me too. 
My balls. 
So take your makeup brush, take your mirror, and you want to comb your eyebrows upwards. 
What are you doing? 
Okay, okay. 
I thought I typed in "Morgan Freeman." 
But I'm so tired, what came up was "more gay men"" but this damon guy is a genius. 
If he had a video on how to build a Murphy bed, it'd already be done. 
Wait. Where's Johnny? 
What happened? 
Did you ask him? 
No, he left. 
Out the back? 
Yeah, it got even weirder. 
He grabbed my boob. 
Or... he didn't grab my... 
he grabbed my boob. 
I just don't know whether it was on purpose. 
But I asked, like you told me to, and now I have a weird boob moment to go with my weird celery moment. 
That is very complicated. 
But I'm great with relationship stuff. 
So come on over here, and we'll hammer it all out while we hammer this all out. 
Come on, this is where you break down and finally help me build the bed. 
No, this is where I go to my already-built bed. 
And after Peaches today and... 
Whatever that was out there with my boob, I'm not showing anyone my cards anymore... 
business or personal. 
Go in! 
Go in! Oh! 
What is happening out here? 
That's the kind of pounding that's supposed to happen after you're in the bed. 
I can't do it. 
I tried. 
I really did, but I can't. 
I guess I can't do anything without my father's money. 
You were right. 
Trying is embarrassing. 
So I'm not going to try anymore. 
I'm sick of it. 
I'm going to sleep on that horrible couch and get bad tips and cry every waitress day for the rest of my life. 
Daddy, please. 
God, you're a baby. 
Okay, I'll help you... 
this one time only. 
And we're not going to bond when we do it. 
We're not going to high-five when we finish. 
And I don't want to hear two months from now, "hey, remember that night we built the Murphy bed? 
That was awesome." 
None of that. Got it? 
We need the power drill, 1/4-inch bit, some masonry screws, and a Bear Claw. 
Now delete "eyebrows," type in "Murphy bed," and let's build this mother. 
I can't believe we did it. 
Yeah, it looks pretty good. 
Oh, Max. 
You put the bakery up on your vision beam. 
Say anything more, and I'll take it down. 
Do you know this number? 
That's Peach. 
 Why would she call you? 
 It's about the cupcake business... 
my number's on the card. 
Put it on speaker. 
Hello? 
I found your card in my baby's room. 
I have no idea who you are or how it got there, but I'm throwing a birthday party in a week, and I thought cupcakes might be fun. 
Oh, they are. 
People love cupcakes. 
They bring a sense of whimsy and nostalgia. 
That's enough. 
Why don't you tell me some of the other events you've done? 
Oh, well, we're a start-up company. 
Oh, no, I need a real business. 
Bye-bye. 
Well, there you go... 
complete waste of our time. 
See? 
Trying is embarrassing. 
No. That was great, incredible. 
What? She hung up on you. 
Yes. But it proves one thing. 
The cards... they worked! 
This is so inspiring. 
First we build a Murphy bed, next a cupcake business, then, Max... 
Who knows what else? 
Uh, adjust the springs? 
No, that's perfect. 
﻿1 Pick up! 
Tables 12, 4, 11. 
Got it. 
Hey, when you get a second, stop looking at my boobs. 
Excuse me. 
Waitress? 
Dude? 
Hi, what can I get ya? 
We need some... 
Is that annoying? 
Is that obnoxious and rude? 
Would you find it distracting if someone did that to you while you were working? 
Oh, you don't have a job. 
Sorry. 
Damn, dude, she burned you. 
Oh. 
No, hipster. 
Do not think we're on the same team. We have nothing in common. 
I wear knit hats when it's cold out. 
You wear knit hats 'cause of coldplay. 
You have tattoos to piss off your dad. 
My dad doesn't know he's my dad. 
You think... 
This is the sound that gets you service. 
I think... 
This is the sound that dries up my vagina. 
The other waitress disappeared, the Russian one. 
We need horseradish. 
Please. 
That, ladies, is how you treat a waitress. 
Paulina! 
Oh, so... so good, oh... 
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you were on break. 
I just need some horseradish. 
 Here. 
 Oh, cool. 
Excuse me, where's my waitress? 
She's coming. 
Earl. 
Earl! 
I made your favorite, red velvet. 
My little cupcake brought me a cupcake. 
Let me pay you for that. 
Oh, no, no. 
It's on the house. 
It's your birthday. 
How old are you gonna be? 
75. 
Oh, Earl, if you were just three years younger. 
Max, Max, big news. 
The new boss fired that Russian waitress, Paulina. 
Turns out Chesty Kournikova was Vladimir puttin' it out. 
Hello today. 
I have paycheck for you. 
I need to talk to you. 
You fired Paulina, Han? 
I am no longer Han Lee. 
I have new American name to go with changing neighborhood. 
To go with the changing neighborhood. 
You need to remember this for your immigration exam. 
Correct. To go with 
the changing neighborhood. 
Bryce? 
Your name is Bryce Lee? 
Wait, wait, um, um, um... 
Don't hire a new waitress, okay? 
I've been doing all the work anyway, and I really could use the extra money. 
You need help. 
 No, I don't. 
 Everyone need help sometimes. 
I don't. I've been waiting 
my whole life, okay? 
I've waited on tables, I've waited in bars, I've waited on home pregnancy tests. 
I already hire new waitress. 
She work in all top restaurants in Manhattan. 
I gave her Paulina's uniform. 
 Hi. 
Mr. Lee, 
not to complain, but I think someone wore this uniform before me, like right before me. 
Is it possible that I could get another one? 
Maybe one that's a little less moist. 
Also this mustard color doesn't really go with my skin tone, neither do the mustard stains... 
And these various other stains, and smells. 
I hope that's clam chowder. 
So... 
I think it'd be better for everyone, including my immune system, if I just keep on wearing what I'm wearing, and not the apron, 'cause this is Chanel. 
So thank you, and let's waitress. 
 Whatever that is, it does not belong in this diner. 
It belongs in a show on Bravo. 
But she blonde, hair so shiny, good for business. 
Where do you even find these people? 
The Russian hooker, the one before that was a meth addict. 
You train her, I am boss. 
 Da boss. 
 Oh. 
Fine, but make her wear the uniform. 
Are you sure we can't get the meth addict back? 
She was really good at cleaning. 
But her teeth fall out. 
You are really judgmental, you know that? 
I'm only gonna say this once, so pay attention. 
I'm Caroline, by the way. 
And you're Max? 
Don't get attached. 
This is the Williamsburg diner, owned by Han Lee, who just changed his name to Bryce Lee, because I guess he wants people to take him even less seriously. 
Eight months ago he bought it from the Russian mob. 
Clientele used to be all eastern bloc criminals and crack whores, but then he took it over and ruined it. 
Hey, sexy woman. 
You look so pretty today. 
You look so beautiful, I forgot how bad your personality is. 
Thanks, Oleg. 
Hey, Barbie. 
He will hit on you aggressively and relentlessly. 
He doesn't realize he looks like that, and I don't have the heart to tell him. 
Could we have some menus? 
Oh, sure. 
Don't smile. 
'Cause it raises the bar, and then I have to smile, and I can't be doing that. 
It's exhausting and I have a bad back. 
That's Earl, we're in love. 
Do not talk to him, unless you want to feel whiter than you already are. 
Oh, and that stain? 
Not clam chowder. 
Go marry the ketchups. 
Marry the ketchups. 
I'm on it. 
Okay. 
Now divorce the ketchups. 
Stop. 
Just stop. 
There's no such thing as divorcing the ketchups. 
You've never waitressed a day in your life. 
Yes, I have. 
You expect me to believe you after watching that whole Temple Grandin routine? 
 I'm telling Lee. 
 Okay, okay, I may have enhanced my resume. 
Enhanced? 
What, are we in Paris? 
Please, I really need this job, okay? 
We lost all of our money. 
My trust fund was taken for legal fees. 
My dad is in jail. 
What? What are you, 
Martin Channing's daughter? 
Where's the paper? 
Martin Channing? 
The guy who ripped off the entire city is your father. 
He told us we were having a good year. 
You're Caroline Channing. 
You're like a billionaire. 
Was. 
Was a billionaire. 
They froze all our assets, everything's gone. 
I only have what I could grab, and I grabbed all the wrong things. 
 So do you know the president? 
 I've met him. 
 He's hot. 
 He's the president. 
 Have you been to Switzerland? 
 Yes. 
 Do you have a horse? 
 Yes. 
 Do you know Paris Hilton? 
 No, she's a hundred. 
Excuse me, uh, two hot chocolate, please. 
 Comin' up. 
 It... 
let me do that, please. 
I'm a really fast learner. 
I went to Wharton business school. 
I got 2,300 on my SAT's Can you make a hot chocolate, or not? 
Nailed it. 
We split the tips. 
Give me yours. 
You did better than I thought you would. 
Listen, tonight I thought of a way we could make some extra money. 
They've totally underestimated the price point on those red velvet cupcakes. 
In Manhattan the asking price is at least seven, so we could sell them for seven, and then pocket the difference. 
Nothing about that sounds wrong to you? 
It's not our fault that the idiot who makes the cupcakes doesn't know their worth. 
I'm the idiot who makes the cupcakes. 
New information. 
That's stupid. 
No one would pay $7 for one of my cupcakes. 
Really? 
'Cause... 
Well, at least we know you're not adopted. 
So how'd you even end up in Brooklyn? 
Oh, I went on monster.com. 
Typed in "place where nobody from the Upper East Side would ever go, ever," and this diner came up. 
You can't wear a fancy leather jacket outside in this neighborhood. 
You have to turn it inside out. 
Oh. 
Fur. Cool. 
Turn it back. 
So where do you live? 
Our townhouse was taken and bolted up by the bank, so... 
Is this where I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? 
I mean, I don't want you to, but just so you know, a well-adjusted person would. 
I'm dead inside. 
You make that pretty obvious. 
Anyway, I'm just gonna stay in the city with a friend. 
I live a couple of blocks that way. 
I'd walk you to the subway, it's just that I don't want to. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
  Why is the music so loud? 
Whoa! 
It's 3:00 in the morning. 
I'm sorry. 
It's cool. 
So what are you doin'? 
The band's practicing. 
But you're not playing any instruments. 
Yeah, that's how we practice. 
We, like, listen to other good music and play it in our head. 
It's like The Secret. 
Well, I have a secret for you guys. 
 Get out! 
 Whoa! 
 Uh, you guys better go. 
 We should go. 
Sorry, guys, I still have to make the cupcakes. 
Cupcakes? For why? You can 
just buy 'em at the store. 
You can do that in the morning, babe, come to bed. 
No, I can't. I have to 
be in the city by 10:00. 
Fine. 
You can have three minutes. 
Fine, you can have eight, one for each ab. 
Boom! 
Stand clear of the closing doors. 
Well, I can cross that off my bucket list. 
Hey. 
I have a taser! 
Oh! 
Oh, my God. 
I am so sorry. 
I didn't think it would hurt so much. It's pink. 
It didn't feel pink. 
I didn't know it was you. 
I thought I was being raped. 
That's not what rape feels like. 
Did you... 
did you sleep on the subway? 
 I had nowhere else to go, and I'm too afraid to sleep outside on the street. 
God, you're spoiled. 
Next stop, greenpoint. 
Ugh! Get your stuff. Come on, 
I'll take you to my place, but hurry. 
'Cause I have to be in the city in 30 minutes. 
Call me. 
Oh, my God, you've been robbed! 
This is how it always looks. 
Oh, my God, totally cute! 
All right, I'll be back at 4:00, and we can go to work together. 
Bathroom, bedroom, boyfriend sleeps till 4:00, yard. 
Oh, you have a yard. 
Looks like a really nice place to relax and do crack. 
It is. 
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late for my other job in the city. 
You have two jobs? 
Yes, I babysit for a Manhattan socialite diva. 
Now I have a set. 
Sorry I'm late. 
Oh, thank God you're here, there is a bridge and tunnel smell over by the babies that's stressing me out. 
Their diapers probably need to be changed. 
Again? I swear, 
the morning nanny just did that. 
Motherhood is for reals. 
Max, remind me, what's my Twitter password? 
Twitter password. 
Yes! 
Hi, Brad. 
Hi, Angelina. 
Max, I need to tell you something because we're family. 
Now get me room temperature water and come over here. 
We are victims of the Channing Ponzi scheme. 
Me, David, and Brangelina. 
How much money did you lose? 
Hold my hands. 
Nothing. 
But it really scared me. 
Open that? 
So do you know Caroline Channing? 
No, but she lost everything. 
She has no money. 
Can you imagine having no money? 
I mean, you wouldn't even have any money. 
You should twit that. 
And no one will even talk to her. 
I heard she went to six different friends' houses for a place to stay, and they all had to pretend they weren't home. 
 That's not cool. 
 Yeah. 
 That's really sad. 
 So sad. 
Breaks my heart. 
I guess motherhood has really opened me up emotionally. 
Max, I need to hold one of the babies, bring me one. 
No, the other one. 
That's not the good one. 
Hello. 
Oh, hi. Oh, I'm so sorry 
if I woke you up. 
Who are you? 
I'm Max's friend. 
Uh, don't tell her I said that. 
I have a feeling if she heard me call her my friend, she'd stab me. 
What are you doin' over there? 
Just washing my uniform, trying to make it a little more cute and a little less crusty. 
Oh, watch out! 
Oh! 
Sorry, oh, my... 
 Do you have a towel or a rag? 
 No, I... I got it. 
Oh, okay. 
I'm Robbie. 
I'm uncomfortable. 
You're getting me wet. 
That's the point. 
You're Max's boyfriend. 
It's cool. 
No, it's not. 
Back up, Jersey shore. 
You're pathetic, and that's coming from someone who's homeless and wearing white after labor day. 
And I've seen better. 
No, you haven't. 
Hey. 
Why didn't you wait for me? 
I thought we were coming over together. 
Oh. Um, I wanted to get here 
early to marry the ketchups. 
Listen, I heard something really upsetting about you today. 
What did he say, that I came on to him? 
Him who? 
Nothing. 
Him, Robbie? 
It's none of my business, but you deserve better than that guy. 
Yeah, it is none of your business. 
Ooh, I was just starting to feel sorry for you. 
I'm just saying, you're worth more than that. 
What, I'm supposed to believe you about this? 
The person who lied on their resume, and lied about the cupcakes... 
you're a liar. 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 You know what? 
Since you seem to know so much about everything, why don't you take your Wharton degree, and your ridiculous coat, and figure this all out yourself. 
Max. 
 Max, wait. 
 Oh, look, the arcade fire concert just let out across the street, good luck with that. 
She's coming back, right? 
She's not gonna leave me here alone with a restaurant full of people? 
Let me put it to you this way. 
You might as well be a night maid at the Schwarzenegger house. 
You got screwed. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, yeah. 
That feels so good. 
Now put your tambourine around it. 
Hi, honey, I'm home. 
I want you gone by the time I get back. 
Babe! 
Babe, I can explain. 
You weren't supposed to be home. 
People say I deserve better than you. 
Who? 
That blonde girl? She doesn't 
know what she's talkin' about. 
She went to Wharton and Switzerland. 
Yo, yo. 
Look at that. 
That girl is workin' harder than Stephen Hawking tryin' to put in a pair of cufflinks. 
Here, let me help you with that. 
I don't need any help. 
Everyone needs help sometimes. 
This isn't what I ordered. 
This is Caroline. 
She may have gotten your order wrong, but she does get some things right. 
Thank you. 
 No, thank you. 
What'd you see in that guy, anyway? 
He had these muscle thingies. 
 Oh, those things? 
 Yeah. 
I don't know what those are called, but they make smart girls stupid. 
 Max! 
I thought your tight ass wasn't coming in tonight, and my heart broke in half. 
You know what, Oleg? 
I needed that. 
So, um... 
I need a roommate, if you want to crash. 
Hmm. 
Not gonna lie, the subway's cleaner than your couch. 
Wow. 
I just felt myself starting to like you. 
Really? Because I really feel 
like we could... 
I knew that wouldn't last. 
Come on. 
Tomorrow we can go into the city and get the rest of your stuff. 
Everything's locked up. 
What, you have nothing that you care about that we can get? 
Well, there is one thing. 
The weirdest thing is that nobody stopped us. 
I'm gonna save a fortune, keeping him here instead of in the stables. 
When did you put this whole horse-in-my-yard thing together? 
I can't help it. 
I see an opportunity, and I make it happen, like with your cupcakes. 
Like what with my cupcakes? 
Ready? 
To open a bake shop, all we need is 250 grand start-up money, for the real estate, and the basic equipment... 
Yeah. Oh. 
 250 grand, that's all? 
 Yeah. 
Did freakin' Chestnut here kick you in the head while I was in Starbucks? 
 Hear me out. 
If we both worked two jobs and made $2,000 a week, we could open a cupcake business in a little over a year. 
In the past two days, we've made $387, and that's a good start. 
We can make extra money at other jobs, like publicists, advertising executives... 
Janitors, drug mules. 
We really need to work on your self-esteem. 
So... 
You, cupcakes, me, business background, us, success. 
What do you think? 
I think you have a horse. 
I think we have a horse. 
Don't get attached. 
*** Max, a woman in my section wants to know if we do anything gluten-free. 
What do I tell her? 
Tell her she's not allergic to gluten, she's just masking an eating disorder. 
Look alive, people. 
Club sandwich, burger medium, and a shrimp salad for the gamblin' man. 
I asked for salt and pepper. 
I wanted mayonnaise and mustard. 
You forgot my diet soda. 
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back with Oh, what? 
Never doubt me. 
Here's my last check, Earl. 
Look here, Max. That lady 
just slipped me her number. 
Like I need another menopausal white woman scratchin' at my window like a cat in heat. 
God, I love money. 
I know, I'm so sorry it broke up with you. 
Look! This week's new iPad 
just came out. 
Spread the words. 
Word. 
Word! 
I saw that on The Wire. 
Max, three weeks in a row you have not yet accepted my request to be a Facebook friend. 
Max? 
I am talking to you. 
Oh, I didn't hear you, I have my earbuds in. 
What are these? 
Okay, you had to bust a move, and get "the truth" on my ass? 
Fine, let's go there. 
Han, I'm never gonna be your Facebook friend. 
Oof! 
Hard to hear. 
Well, I accepted you, Han. 
Yes, thank you. 
You make my heart sing. 
Oof. 
Hurt me still. 
That was like watching someone club a baby seal. 
Why wouldn't you just say yes to his friend request? 
Because I never check Facebook, why would I? 
So some girl I worked at a movie theater with in 2005 can tell me it's raining and she's "totes bummed?" 
Caroline! 
Better check Facebook page. 
Maybe someone just post on your wall. 
"Han Lee has tagged you in 25 photos?" 
Want to borrow my seal club yet? 
Oh, that stings. I've lost 
like 300 Facebook friends since my father was arrested. 
Well, your father's probably made that many new friends in prison, so it all evens out. 
Okay, ready to go? 
Do we have to? 
It's so hot outside. 
When did heat get so hot? 
Stop fighting it, just give in to it. 
I don't know why I'm quoting a rapist. 
Can't we just stay a little bit longer? 
We don't have any A.C. at home. 
I have an A.C. 
you girls can use. 
You have an air conditioner that works? 
Oh, it works. 
That's like an A.C. that just had salami. 
There's more salami where that came from. 
And my feet hurt. 
Well, you gotta stop wearing those stilts, and get a pair of Skechers, like normal broke-ass waitresses. 
Skechers? 
How dare you. 
Besides, I can't afford new shoes. 
These cost $900. 
Well, then that's not pain, that's karma. 
Look, I will help you out, okay? 
I know a place we can go that has designer things at good prices. 
Like a Barney's warehouse? 
Kind of. 
The Goodwill? 
Welcome to my place! 
We're shopping at the Goodwill? 
You led me to believe we were real-shopping. 
I know. 
I couldn't wait to see your face when you saw this place. 
Do the face again. 
I love it! 
Okay, what's that smell? 
It's gonna be your smell from now on. 
Now, pay attention, I know where the good stuff is. 
I know where the good stuff is. 
Madison and 57th. 
Follow me. 
Clever bitches hide stuff they want to come back and buy, 'cause sometimes they don't have $3 to buy it at the time. 
Who doesn't have $3? 
You. 
Last week I hid a dope vintage blazer in the back of a nightstand, and here it is! 
Six bucks, clever bitch. 
Bang, bang! 
All right, well, we're here. 
I'm gonna make the best of it, but first I need a basket without a sno-cone in it. 
Hey, Trish. 
Not for day-to-day, but at the country club. 
You're kidding, but you're right. 
Hey, when you find something, check the pockets for pills. 
At a thrift store downtown I found a purple one once, and took it. 
Fell asleep for eight hours. 
That was my vacation that year. 
Yay, shoes! 
Oh, I can't believe I just said, "yay," in Goodwill. 
Look, don't freak. 
Shoes can be funky, but I have a special spray at home that makes them like new. 
Did you get it from a wizard? 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God, these Brian Atwoods were mine. 
I donated these to charity, 'cause I was photographed wearing them twice. 
Okay, they were $800 when I bought them, now they're $8? 
Like me. I'm $8. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm $8. 
I've been reduced. 
I'm sorry, it just all became so real to me. 
I mean, I can't believe it. 
Um, didn't you see me crying? 
Lots of people cry at Goodwill. 
You go to France, you eat snails. 
You come here, you cry. 
That's odd, you didn't even react. 
You need to react when people cry. 
I did, I rolled my eyes. 
Look, eventually, you'll learn to do that on the inside. 
Okay, well, just FYI, when I used to cry in front of my other girlfriends, they'd be like, "What you cryin' about, C-line? 
"Look at you, girl, you're fierce, you got your glam on." 
Are your girlfriends black drag queens? 
Oh, awesome strokes tee. 
I went to this concert, but I couldn't afford the shirt. 
Oh, we're done with me. 
I went to see them on this tour the summer after my junior year. 
It was a really warm night, and I snuck out of the house, and we all ma Ahem. 
Whatever. 
And what? 
What, did something great happen the night you got the t? 
Look at me, does it look like something great ever happens? 
Hey, cute tee. 
Had my eye on it. 
I was just bringin' my girl back to see it. 
She was in the bathroom. 
I had to throw up. 
So hand it over. 
You know the rule. 
Turn the back on the rack, you're under attack. 
That's not me, that's the law of the 'Will. 
Yeah, you better walk away. 
That was intense. 
Ah, just another Wednesday at the 'Will. 
You said to look in things, right? 
Max, look. 
On my first try! 
Ooh, slick. Whoever 
hid those is gonna be pissed. 
Quality check. 
Fabric sturdy, no mysterious crotch stains, nice work, Nancy Drew. 
And look, they're designer. 
Summer 2009. $350. 
And for me today... 
$5. 
That's a reduction I like. 
$5! 
Oh! 
$5, $5, $5, $5... 
$5, $5... 
Hi, Maria. 
How are you, Max? 
I'm good, how's your mom doin'? 
Good. She really appreciated 
the cupcakes you made her. 
Hi, Maria, I'm Caroline, Max's friend. 
Any way we can get the price down a bit for these? 
I think $8 is steep, considering their condition. 
I happen to know the heel has been replaced. 
I cannot believe you're trying to shoe her down. 
I can do $6. 
Deal. 
Oh, you happy? 
You haggled a charity. 
You're turning Goodwill into bad will. 
My t-shirt's gone. 
It's not here. 
I bet it was that Puerto Rican girl, who was who was eyeing it. 
Maria, can we call security? 
I'm sure one of the cameras must have captured the theft. 
Cameras? What do you think 
this is, target? 
It's gone, Caroline. 
She must have stolen it while I was watching you do your stupid $5 dance. 
I didn't turn my back on the rack, why am I under attack? 
See, this is why I shop alone, this is why I eat alone, this is why I'm leaving alone. 
Maria, I'll pay for these. 
You don't have to box them, you can just use tissue paper. 
Even as I'm saying this, I know it's not gonna happen. 
Chestnut... 
Hot as a mother, right? 
Better, right? 
# It's gettin' hot in here # # so hot! # 
# so take off all your clothes # # I am gettin' so hot # # I'm gonna take my clothes off # You might want to keep your voice down. 
This building has three registered sex offenders. 
# It's gettin' hot in here # # so leave all that strokes tee shirt drama behind # Come on, it's our night off. 
Let's go get drunk in air conditioning. 
We won't even have to pay for drinks. 
These "shotes" is gonna pay for our drinks. 
You are literally a $5 whore right now. 
Come on. 
# Ai-ee ai-ee # # ai-ee ai-ee # Hey, Johnny. 
I thought I told you to keep your dumb, tragic ass out of here. 
The only thing that isn't tragic about me is my ass. 
And who's the blonde, bony skank? 
Oh, dude, she's not in on this. 
Oh, I'm so sorry, miss. 
Hey, I'm Johnny, I'm Max's friend. 
I'm Caroline. 
I'm freaked out. 
This is something we do. 
 To remind us of our families. 
 Mmhmm. 
Excuse me for a second. 
These guys tip more if I high-five 'em when we talk about chicks. 
Vagina! 
Yeah! 
Wow. Girl, 
your bartender friend is cute. 
Look at those arms. 
Nice guns. 
He's not just a bartender, this dude is legit. 
He's a street artist, goes by "Jpeg." 
Hmm. 
Well, right now he's cutting up limes and cleaning glasses. 
Well, you're an heiress who's slinging burnt hash and stale toast. 
Touche. 
Douch-ay. 
These are from the gentleman with a sweet note, "Nice ass, nice rack." 
Whoo! 
Hoo. 
If that's your tequila noise, God knows what your orgasm sounds like. 
Same face, no sound. 
Oh, my God. 
I can't believe it, it's the girl from the 'Will. 
I got your back, gir-r-r. 
What is she doin'? 
She thinks Goodwill has made her tough. 
Um, hi. 
How are you? 
I just wanted to talk to you about that shirt at the Goodwill. 
See, my friend really wanted it, and, well, your friend has it. 
What are you sayin', bitch? 
Okay, I think we might have got off on the wrong foot. 
Do you want to feel my foot, bitch? 
Well, I guess we know what your favorite word is. 
Ow! 
Those are not extensions, bitch! 
Oh! 
I should break this up, I should break this up. 
No, no, no, give her like four seconds to learn her lesson. 
Oh, okay, ow! 
All right. All right! 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 Ow! Oh, oh. 
Okay, come on, come on. 
 Oh! 
 It's okay. 
Those are not extensions, bitch! 
Are you still laughing, 'cause it wasn't funny. 
It was so funny. 
It was like looney tunes funny. 
It was like Bugs Bunny getting shot in the face funny. 
Only in your version, Bugs Bunny tries to have a dialogue with the shotgun. 
I was trying to get your t-shirt back. 
I wanted you to have it, because you lit up at the 'Will when you saw it. 
I do not light up, okay? 
There's no light inside me. 
What you're seeing is probably radiation from the summer I collected uranium tubes by the train tracks. 
That was good money. 
Thanks for looking out for me, Caroline. 
You're welcome, Max. 
It's a t-shirt, it's gone. 
I don't get attached to things. 
Ow. My nail practically 
got torn off back there by "Cat Von D-Minus." 
I'm gonna have to sleep with it elevated. 
Is there a nail place around here? 
Well, this is New York, so there's probably gonna be one right... 
here. 
Love when that happens. 
Look, a two-for-one girlfriend special. Genius. 
Go with me tomorrow before work, it'll be cheaper if we both go. 
I really need one. 
Plus, you need one, too. 
Well, I can't. I have my own 
day of luxury already booked. 
I'm doing a laundry, and then the tasting menu at Wendy's. 
Come on. You and me, nails, 
and air conditioning. 
It'll be fun. 
You're doin' it, gir-r-rl. 
Me and my friends used to love getting manicures. 
'Cause they're black drag queens? 
# Ai-ee ai-ee # # ai-ee ai-ee # Oh. 
Hey, dude. 
It's about that time? 
Let me get the pooper scooper. 
All right. 
Let's do this. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
Let me ask you something. 
How is it that you, a horse, and Caroline are both living with me, and you're less of a problem for me? 
I mean, you tell me, you've known her longer. 
She picks a fight with a tatted-out white chick from the Bronx? 
What is up with that? 
I don't know, man, I'm just used to it. 
That's what you'd sound like, if you talked. 
I agree with you, by the way. 
Everything you say is right, Max. 
Thank you, Chestnut. 
You should kill her. 
Chestnut! 
I can't do that. 
It'll be easy. 
We could kill her and eat her. 
Chestnut! 
All right, buddy, here's your spot. 
Come on, do your business. 
Come on, Ches. 
Buh-buh-buh buh-buh. 
Buh-buh-buh buh-boo. 
Come on. 
Come on! 
Come on, Chestnut, I got a lot of crap to do today. 
And so do you. 
Jeez, don't be shy, buddy... 
I hope you're happy. I look 
like a Cambodian stripper. 
Um, they prefer to be called "ping pong ball artists." 
These cost $70.43. 
She forced me to get tips, and then tip her for the tips. 
See, and all because you never showed up, I didn't get the two-for-one discount, because I was waiting alone, for you. 
Max, I have really tried to be girlfriends with you, but you obviously have some issues. 
Follow me to the walk-in. 
Good, let's get it out. 
Here. 
I thought we were gonna talk. 
No, we just didn't have any chocolate cream in the case. 
Why didn't you show up? 
You told me you were gonna be there. 
Well, I had a lot of crap to do. 
Well, you gave me the impression you were going. 
I gave you the impression? 
I don't do impressions. 
Well, wait, that's not true, I do one, my mom. 
But to do that. 
I need a Christmas tree, a gallon of vodka, and a lit cigarette. 
So are we gonna be girlfriends or not? 
Look, I'm gonna give this to you straight up. 
I am never gonna be the type of girlfriend you're used to. 
I am not your gir-r-r, or your gir-r-rl, and I am definitely not someone's two-for-one girlfriend crap at a nail store. 
In fact, think of me as a dude. 
So-o-o, are we good? 
Yeah. We good. 
I get it. 
You're not a girl's girl. 
Okay, good. 
I can be a girl's girl. 
Oh, Caroline, please do not take advantage of me with your horse. 
What? 
My trash pick up company charged me extra, because my dumpster is full of all your horse droppings. 
How would that be possible? 
I see your good friend, Max, walking your horse every morning and dropping droppings in my dumpster. 
Hi. 
Hello. 
Did you walk my horse today? 
Yeah, and every other morning. 
That's so sweet. 
I wish I had known. 
Well, what was I gonna do, post it on your Facebook wall? 
"Ha, walked a horse again today. 
Totes gross." 
Besides, who did you think was doing it? 
I've always just had things done for me, I've never really thought about the people doing them. 
Yeah, and I've never had things done for me, so I just do them. 
Like now, how I'm making the coffee, and you're just standing here watching me. 
Still, I wish you would have told me, so I could say thank you. 
Well, it's not really my style. 
You are one complicated dude. 
Pick up, borscht. 
 Unbelievable. 
 What? 
Hey. 
How you guys doin'? 
Cute strokes tee. 
Probably look better on me, considering it's mine. 
You snooze, you lose, puta. 
Nice language! 
You kiss your obviously closeted boyfriend with that mouth? 
You know what? 
I wouldn't even want it now. 
Now that it's been on you, might as well have been a Kenny G shirt. 
And now I walk. 
You can't just let her win. 
Oh, forget it, it's over. 
Borscht! 
Pick up, pick up. 
Hi, I'll be right with you. 
Oh! 
 Idiota! 
 Oh. 
Esta camiseta me costo cuatro dolares! 
Te voy a cortar. 
Lo siento. 
Todo es mi culpa. 
I'm still a little clumsy, it's my first week. 
I'll bring you some soda water, but seriously, your boyfriend will come out before that borscht stain does. 
That was awesome. 
Yeah. 
I kinda just do stuff. 
Like I just did, while you were standing there watching me. 
Thanks, gir-r-rlfriend. 
Oh. 
What, is she coming for me? 
Run.
