Okay, everyone time to divvy up what's in the Lost & Found box. 
If my dignity's in there, tell it I say "What up." 
This is my favorite day of the month. 
Oh, God, I've fallen so far so fast. 
You haven't fallen that far. 
First item A scrunchie. 
I need that. 
Give me! 
I think I hit my bottom. 
Okay, next item. 
A pregnancy test. 
That's empty. 
What? 
I had two free minutes, and you never know. 
Can we move this along? 
I'm an old man, and I need to get to bed. 
You are late to meet woman for hot date. 
You know it. 
A wallet and... 
No money. 
What? 
If I was pregnant, I needed it for the baby. 
And finally for the sixth month in a row... 
The wig. 
All: The wig! 
Han, it's your turn. 
We have all put it on except you. 
If I had to take a picture in it, you have to take a picture in it. 
Okay, fine. 
Man, I'm a fun boss. 
Oh, sorry, sir. 
We're closed. 
I was just checking if I left my toupee here. 
Take the picture quick. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  I got it. 
Here it is. 
The new Martha Stewart Living. 
I ran so fast, the librarian said, "Stop running in the library," and I almost said, "This is different. 
I'm stealing." 
Why are you still even looking through Martha Stewart Living every month? 
'Cause we might be mentioned in it. 
Martha said she hadn't forgotten about us. 
That's what my mother said, but I spent a whole day and night in that school parking lot. 
Silver lining I still know the whole rap part to TLC's Waterfalls. 
Well, I'm still holding out hope we're in this, even though I've been hurt two months in a row. 
Oh, God, am I in an abusive relationship with a lifestyle guru? 
Okay, let's get this over with. 
"How to make him love your salmon." 
"How to make him love your stretch marks." 
Hey, he just doesn't love you. 
Activia ad, Activia ad, Activia ad. 
We get it, Jamie Lee. 
You poop lot. 
 "Get your oven Marthaclean," "Max's something cupcakes" scarf, scarf, scarf. 
Wait, Max's cupcakes? 
You just said, "Max's something cupcakes." 
I did? 
Wow, my ears are so not used to anything good coming out of my mouth. 
There. 
There. Look. 
Both: "Max's Homemade Cupcakes is a Williamsburg must-have." 
What's this? 
What's my face doing? 
 You're smiling, Max. 
 No way! 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
It's a blurb. 
Everyone, we got a blurb in Martha Stewart Living. 
Can I get some more coffee? 
Are you insane? 
Hey, everyone. 
What's the excitement? 
Is it 'cause I'm here? 
Sophie, look, Max's homemade cupcakes got a blurb in Martha Stewart Living. 
Oh, that's funny, 'cause I got a blurb in New York Apartment Life. 
Look. "Sophie's Choice 
Cleaning Service--" they clean like their life depends on it." 
Well, that's not exactly the same. 
No, 'cause, look, I got three plungers. 
Yeah, but I didn't want to brag. 
That must be Andy wondering if I'm coming over to have sex tonight. 
Could my life get any better? 
Oh, my God. 
It could get better. 
There are, like, ten cupcake orders here. 
Birthday, baby shower, bris. 
Can we do a bris? 
Sure. I'll just make 
a little rosette foreskin and write around the outside, "Congratulations on not terrifying women in 20 years." 
Hey, Andy. 
Hi, candy. 
Did you see it? 
Did you see the new Martha Stewart Living? 
Oh, sorry, no. 
I still have to get through my Glamour and Modern Bride. 
And I had sisters, so I'm allowed to know those names. 
"A Williamsburg must-have." 
Nice. 
You know I feel the same way about you. 
Aw, cute, but it really doesn't mean anything unless it's in a blurb. 
I couldn't wait to show this to you. 
I'm so glad you were here late doing inventory. 
Yeah, you know, it's the weirdest thing. 
The only thing I can't account for is one missing Elvis pez dispenser, Max. 
Um, I don't know what you're talking about, but... 
 Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
Can we please get back to the blurb? 
Sorry. 
You're right. 
I should have made a bigger deal about it. 
It's just I've been a little freaked out. 
We had some big drama here today. 
Drama in a candy store? 
Did the yogurt-covered craisins finally realize how stupid they are and commit mass suicide? 
No, but seriously they pulled some bodies out of the closed-down soup kitchen across the way tonight. 
So now we're completely off the blurb? 
Some guys broke in. 
A bunch of people got shot. 
Apparently, it was a drug deal gone wrong. 
Oh, my God. 
That's horrible. 
I know. Why can't a drug deal 
ever go right? 
Hey, they said it was a real bloodbath. 
I want to see it! 
Oh, okay, so I'm closing the magazine then? 
Max, you can't go in there. 
It's a crime scene. 
There's police tape. 
Is she magic? 
One of my mom's boyfriends used to rob electronic stores. 
He took me once for my birthday. 
Hmm, there should be a light switch around here. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, that's really gross. 
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen! 
Take a picture of me over here. 
I finally have a reason to join Instagram. 
People are gonna be like, "food, food, cat, food, nails, nails, murder?" 
Guys, I can't be in here. 
I get queasy if the meat juice touches my peas. 
Is this your first blood splatter? 
Jeez, someone's a princess. 
Man, they are never gonna be able to rent this place now. 
I'm gonna go over to my store and put blood on the walls so Max will like it more. 
Max, look around. 
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
Yup. 
The shooter stood here, and, based on the blood splatter, he was short and walked with a limp. 
And his name was Mad Dog. 
'Cause I want that to be his name. 
No, Max, you know how we've always wanted our own shop? 
This is it. 
This is Max's homemade cupcakes. 
Oh. 
Yeah, I see that. 
And we can put our red velvets over there by the random skull fragments. 
Besides, I thought our shop was gonna be in Manhattan. 
Manhattan's over. 
Williamsburg is the new hot area, and besides Martha's blurb says we're a Williamsburg must-have, so we must have this space. 
No, we must have the money. 
I mean, this place has got to be, like, $4,000 a month. 
Was. 
Was $4,000 a month. 
That was the pre-tragedy price. 
When people die, it's a buyer's market. 
You want to rent a room in that Shining hotel now, it's, like, 50 bucks a night. 
Well, obviously I wanna start a business in a place where there was a shooting spree. 
And, if we go with red, it's half painted. 
But where are we gonna get the money? 
This blurb is our money in the bank. 
Oh, yeah, that's another thing we don't have. 
A bank. 
There are places set up by women specifically to support other women's small businesses. 
I'm talking girl-on-girl financing. 
That's hot. 
But I don't care how much money they offer us. 
I'm not braiding anyone's hair. 
But are we ready? 
Okay, yes. 
This is a big leap of faith, but we're getting in lots of orders now thanks to the blurb. 
And what's the worst thing that could happen? 
Um, maybe these could be our brains. 
No, not gonna happen. 
We're gonna kill it. 
No disrespect to any spirits still trying to find their way into the light. 
I'll figure out a place, and we'll go first thing in the morning. 
Find something business-y to wear, less cleavage. 
Oh, these are all business. 
Great, I'm gonna go find Andy. 
What is it about real estate that makes you wanna dry hump? 
Max, I'm so excited. 
We're getting our dream. 
You look like you want a hug. 
I do. 
Good night. 
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes," you're up. 
Caroline, why didn't you pick up? 
They just called us early, and I don't know what to write on the paper. 
And I feel like an idiot, my boobs are suffocating, and the only "business" thing I could find was Han's blazer. 
It's itchy, and there's a piece of paper in the pocket with his name on it. 
Why would he have that? 
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes," time is money. 
Um, here. 
But our appointment's not for another 20 minutes. 
Have a seat. 
Cool place. 
Women's small businesses. 
Sisters doing it for themselves. 
Well, I'm doing it for the medical benefits. 
 Go. 
 Oh, now? 
Before she gets here? 
Um, well, I'm not really much of a business person. 
Great way to start a business loan application. 
Go! 
You have a minute. 
Okay, well, um, how much time do I have now? 
Slightly less than a minute. 
Okay, uh, my business partner could explain this better than me, but I'll try. 
We have a cupcake business. 
And we bake cupcakes in my roommate's bedroom. 
I can't hear you. 
You want to write it down, draw it, shape it in clay? 
I would have filled this out more, but that chick over there wouldn't let me cheat off her. 
She's not a girl's girl, know what I mean? 
Very professional. 
Under past loan repayment, you put, "Paid Todd back all the beer money I owed." 
To be fair, he was drunk all the time. 
I could have just said I did. 
Points for honesty. 
Let's get you a new loan application. 
Just got your message. 
The one time I don't come early. 
Speaking of that, I just had the most amazing orgasm. 
I mean, we've been having really great sex, but this morning, I could not get enough of his projected growth ratio investment analysis. 
Hello, Caroline Channing. 
Wharton class of '09. 
That's our business proposal. 
And I would be a little embarrassed about what just happened if I didn't know that we're all just girls here. 
Can we move this along? 
I got a busted toilet and a pregnant dog at home. 
Why didn't you tell me she was under there? 
Oh, sorry, I wasn't expecting a monologue from Confessions of a Call Girl. 
I'm afraid we're gonna have to deny the loan. 
Why? Because she had 
a good orgasm? 
Isn't that what the '70s was about for you gals? 
You have no business history. 
And that's a requirement for us. 
Well, I think we're done here. 
Yeah. 
I just said that. 
I thought you guys were about supporting small women's business. 
And this small woman's "bidness" needs support after the pounding it took today. 
Max, let's go. 
Okay, there's a bank in New Hampshire that doesn't check anything. 
And before someone else grabs our cupcake space, I say we get on a bus and go up there. 
They won't give out their exact address, but I know they're in a mini mall with a white castle. 
Better idea. 
I went to Craigslist, clicked on "etc" and found all kinds of opportunities to make some cash. 
I'm fighting the instinct to weep, but keep going. 
At first I thought I might call pit pig. 
He just wants his armpits smelled, but that's, like, 1,000 sniffs. 
Big commitment. 
Or there's the weirdo looking for pretty amputees, but that feels like a bigger commitment. 
So, check it. 
"Egg donors needed. 
Ten to twenty grand." 
No way, I could never sell my eggs. 
I mean, wouldn't you hate to think you had a kid out there and not know it? 
I probably do. 
In 2006, I invented the Four Loko and Robitussin smoothie. 
It's pretty much a blackout year. 
Seriously, for the right price I'd sell 'em all. 
Really? 
I mean, I know you've always been tough. 
To hear you tell it, you were part of an underground baby fight club. 
But don't you wanna be a mom some day? 
In the history of the world, give me one example of a really good mother. 
You're putting me on the spot. 
All I can think of is Hilary Duff. 
Look, you're complicating this with these things you call emotions. 
Like it or not... 
I'm an egg farm. 
Because we don't know one single person outside of New Hampshire who can lend us that kind of money. 
Yoo-hoo, girls, look out the window. 
Up here! 
It's me! 
Oleg and I would like two cupcakes please. 
I feel weird asking Sophie for money. 
And how do we even know she has any? 
Well, she's building her dream house in Poland between a former death camp and a new W. 
She's gotta be loaded. 
And Sophie's the kind of woman who understands our dreams. 
Come in. 
That's exactly what I thought would be on the other side of that door. 
Oleg, sweetie, we have company. 
I brought you an ass pillow. 
Nice to see you like this outside of work, girls, no? 
Both: No. 
Girls, did you see my big hanging thing? 
Yeah, we kinda just saw it. 
No, I'm talking about my new ch-andelier for my lake house. 
Yeah, I can totally see you drinking ch-ardonnay under it. 
Oh, Max, you are so funny. 
She's a real ch-aracter. 
Yeah, that's not a word. 
Okay, well, we just wanted to bring you some more cupcakes for free, per usual, and perhaps talk about a possible business venture. 
Oh, sorry, girls. 
I have two rules in life: Never drink from the same well as a gypsy and never lend money to friends. 
And, Max, you are my friend. 
Okay, well, we were just checking, but thanks anyway. 
But, Sophie, just hear us out. 
It's a wonderful opportunity, and we'll of course pay you back with interest. 
Okay, buh-bye. 
Let's go. We tried it. 
Now it's----time. 
You are not harvesting your body for money. 
What's the big deal? 
I sold two kidneys for a down payment on my house. 
Not true. 
You need at least one to live. 
Oh, well, they weren't mine. 
Well, you know what we have to do. 
Let's get the bawk out of here. 
And you're sure you're okay with selling your eggs, right? 
Totally. What do I care? 
I've got a million of 'em. 
I'm happy to lose a few. 
More room for beer. 
Lose some eggs, more room for beer. 
It's crazy that's not their slogan. 
So what'd they ask you on the application? 
You know, income, hobbies, "Did you ever have sex in Africa?" 
I wish. 
The closest I ever got was a dude once put his hand up my skirt in an Ethiopian restaurant. 
You know, now that we're here, I think it's kind of wonderful that places like this exist to help women who can't have babies have babies. 
Hey, you think they take points off for syphilis? 
Max, I think it's really noble what you're doing to get our dream. 
This is a very special day. 
How do you spell "chlamydia"? 
Well, no "k"s, and I personally wouldn't heart the "I." 
Oh, thanks. 
And do I gotta put here if my brother touched a kid? 
Max Black. 
Thank you for your interest, but I'm afraid we're gonna have to pass. 
Why? 
I didn't have sex in Africa. 
Yes, I know, that was your one plus, but under "family history," you put "drinking" and "secrets." 
I was being honest. 
Yeah, maybe too honest, because under "education" you wrote, "Jeopardy reruns," and we're really looking for college graduates. 
Jeez, I'll take "elitist" for 500, Alex. 
Sorry, we're looking for girls that come from Ivy league schools and have impressive family backgrounds. 
Maybe her eggs didn't go to Wharton and graduate at the top of their class like I did, but just look at her. 
Who wouldn't want a baby with such strength, beauty, and a rack so great it could breast-feed itself? 
You went to Wharton? 
We pay $20,000 for Ivy league eggs. 
Wow, we're taking blood already? 
I guess going to Wharton does put you on the fast track. 
Just part of the process to become a donor. 
I'm gonna go get some vials, and I'll be right back. 
It's so cool of you to do this. 
It says a lot about you. 
You know what says a lot about me? 
The fact that I know she tied you off wrong. 
I'm happy to do it. 
It's a small price to pay to make our dream come true. 
I'm doin' this to pay down some debt. 
I'm real deep 'cause of Powerball. 
Whoa, dude, how did you get through? 
I went to Harvard. 
I'm like crazy-good at math. 
Max, she's making me nervous. 
Close the curtain. 
And frankly, I'm a little resentful. 
I didn't get into Harvard. 
Are you sure you're okay with this? 
 'Cause you seem a little jumpy. 
 No, I'm fine. 
They're just taking a little blood. 
Or from the looks of it, they're taking all of it. 
There better be a nice juice and a cookie after this. 
Please relax. 
It's only eight vials. 
They gotta take a lot to make sure they don't get a kid with, like, another kid growing out of it. 
Max, this all just got very real. 
 Hold my hand. 
 You know I don't hold hands. 
Oh, you lesbians are so high maintenance. 
Please? 
You don't think I'm gonna give away my best egg, right? 
I'm not gonna give away the concert pianist and get stuck with the guy who breaks into homes and smells women's underwear? 
Well, either way, you got a kid with a passion. 
But you don't have to do this. 
No, I can do this. 
It's for our dream. 
But you don't have to do this. 
I can do this. 
Put it in. 
It's already in. 
I can't do this. 
I'm not trashy, I'm not some farm animal. 
Oh! Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God. 
I am so, so sorry! 
You know what would be cute here? 
A cupcake store. 
Hi, Max. 
Oh, it's chilly outside. 
Nipples everywhere. 
Have a seat. 
I'll be right over. 
Oh, that's okay. 
I texted my order in on the way. 
Hey, baby. I got your text. 
Did you get my erotic haiku? 
I did. 
Did you get the picture I sent of me and the dustbuster? 
No, I didn't. 
Oh, no, Grandpa Yorgish! 
Look. 
Earl framed our blurb. 
 He did? That is so sweet. 
 What? 
I always saw it as bigger on the wall in our shop. 
Look, the shop is an amazing idea, and, if it's not that space right now, it'll be another. 
I mean, there have to be mass murders all over Brooklyn, right? 
If we're lucky. 
And, even if it didn't work out, it's still the closest I've ever come to something great, and that's cool. 
And someday we'll find someone crazy enough to lend us money. 
I say that because, if you can convince me to believe a dream, you can get anyone. 
Pickup. 
Here you go, Sophie. 
That's $11.25. 
Oh, you take a check, right? 
This is for $20,000. 
Oh, is it? 
I thought it was for $20. 
Oh, well. Keep it. 
Maybe you could use it for your dream, or to get your legs waxed, or something. 
 Sophie, are you serious? 
 Yes. 
Sophie, this is really, really amazing. 
Oh, come on. 
I don't need a parade. 
Just keep the cupcakes coming. 
Max, do you know what this means? 
We are going to be a Williamsburg must-have. 
We're getting our dream. 
I feel like you want a hug. 
I do. 
Hi, I'm gonna be your waitress 'cause my mother drank. 
We need a sec. 
Feelin' kinda generous, take two. 
Then he said to me, "Dude, your vagina is weird." 
Dude, that's insane. 
It is so not weird. 
Your vagina's awesome. 
Okay, I'm ready. 
Now I need a sec. 
Well, it's over. 
I can't say it any more. 
The vagina's gone mainstream. 
What's next? 
A clothing line at target? 
Aw, Max, I'm sorry. 
It's your favorite word. 
And my favorite body part. 
But now everyone's saying it. 
Well, we can pick another word for it. 
Something cute, like cookie. 
Yeah, it sounds like a good idea until you walk past a bunch of girl scouts selling their cookies on the street. 
Well, we've gotta pick something, 'cause vagina's everywhere. 
Where? 
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh * This is invitation to Metropolitan Museum Annual Gala. 
We have the invitation. 
She'll be there. 
You are talking about us stalking Martha Stewart. 
So you want me to taste your cupcake in the ladies' room? 
What's inappropriate about that? 
That is our beer batter maple bacon spring break cupcake. 
Quite tasty. 
Do you girls have a card? 
Martha Stewart likes our cupcakes! 
Max, have you seen my phone? 
I wanna take a picture of this bad tip and put it on Instagram. 
Getting loose change used to be so depressing, but now I can share it with strangers. 
Let me sum it up. 
Twitter is stupid. 
And Instagram is Twitter for people who can't read. 
Where is my phone? 
I could've sworn I left it right here, next to yours. 
Oh, I'll just call it. 
Oh, that's not necessary. 
I'm sure it'll turn up... 
* My milkshake * brings all the boys to the yard * * and they're like * it's better than yours in my pocket. 
Max, why are you hiding my phone in your apron? 
Is that the big question, really? 
'Cause I think the bigger question is, why is your ringtone "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard"? 
If you have to ask that, you clearly have not seen my milkshake. 
Okay, here. 
I'm busted. 
I was checking to see if Martha Stewart called us yet. 
You checked it again? 
You check it, like, every 15 minutes. 
I know! 
I am acting like a little bitch. 
Max, Martha Stewart has our business card. 
She liked our cupcakes. 
She'll call. 
Look, in my defense, she asked for our card. 
She got us all hot and bothered. 
And then what? 
Nothing. 
Martha Stewart is cake tease. 
How dare you! 
Martha Stewart is not a cake tease. 
Nothing worse than a cake tease. 
Ask any man. 
Yeah, you shower, you powder your sack. 
For what? 
Look, Max, relax. 
She'll call. 
Everything's gonna work out. 
I mean, a year ago, we didn't even have a cupcake business. 
Look how far we've come. 
I haven't come at all, thanks to the cake tease. 
Oh, your cupcake is quite tasty. 
Do you have a card? 
Max, that's a good Martha Stewart. 
I know, 'cause I can't get her siren voice out of my head. 
Wow, Han. 
You look you were hit by a Mardi Gras and a Gay Pride float. 
I have just returned from the exciting Manhattan Restaurant Trade Show. 
Look at all this free swag. 
And I've got stress balls. 
Well, just go in the back and take care of yourself. 
Listen up, everybody. 
I have a big announcement. 
"- Well, more like a 5'1" announcement. 
I am changing the diner to state-of-the-art computer "power touch" ordering system for food and checks. 
I am not learning anything new. 
I work here because I have no skills. 
You don't have to learn it, Max. 
It's very smart machine. 
 It will help you. 
 Uhhuh. 
That's how it started with machines in The Matrix. 
Next thing you know, the human race was enslaved. 
Been there, done that. 
I'm with Max. 
We are doing it. 
It's important to move the business into the future. 
So get with it, you luddites. 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, girls, we got big trouble. 
If he starts using a new system, I won't be able to use my old system where I skim something off the top. 
Earl, skimming? 
I'm kind of shocked. 
I don't do it for me. 
You know how once a month you girls have really good night in tips? 
You're welcome. 
I have been lying awake at night trying to figure out how we made that 200 bucks with her skills. 
 Hey, girls. 
 Hey, Sophie. 
You know, every time I come here, Im 'surprised you're still open. 
Here you go, Sophie. 
Hey. 
Where's the little Asian woman that always hands me my menu? 
Asian woman? 
You mean Han? 
Mm-hm. 
Sophie, Han's a man. 
If you say so. 
Is there anything special tonight? 
Yes. 
Here I am... 
With treats for my sweet. 
Aww. 
Day-glo zebra? 
That's my favorite animal. 
Oh, and edible underwear! 
That's my favorite snack. 
Yeah, and they're crotchless, so less carbs. 
Oh, and my favorite microwavable lube. 
And what's this? 
Toothbrushes? 
Oh, that's going to hurt you, but okay. 
No, I want to leave them at your house, now that you and I are exclusive. 
Exclusive? 
Wait, hold phone. 
Are you telling me that you and I are not exclusive? 
Exclusive? 
Oh, come on. 
Stop it now. 
Go on Jay Leno. 
Caroline, did you think Sophie and I were exclusive? 
Well, you have stopped showing us your penis. 
Exactly! 
If that's not exclusive, I don't know what is. 
Exclusive! 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, come on, stop it, before I... 
Oh. Oh. 
It happened. 
I split my spanx. 
Martha Stewart, please. 
It's Michelle Obama. 
What's this about? 
My sheets shrunk and I am pissed. 
Hello? 
Max, it didn't work when you were Mick Jagger with a busted muffin tin, or Alicia keys with a wonky shower curtain. 
And it really didn't work when you were Steve Jobs back from the dead with thoughts on her panini press. 
Stop sober dialing Martha Stewart! 
Who says I'm sober? 
Max, give me your phone. 
* My milkshake * brings all the boys to the yard * Now give me my phone. 
Okay, take it, done. 
I'm over her. 
When is she gonna call me? 
My milkshake would totally bring her to the yard. 
Max, this isn't you. 
I mean, you're strong. 
You're a badass. 
You beat H.P.V. 
With Tylenol. 
And it wasn't even the name brand. 
What's wrong with you? 
I was a virgin before Martha, okay? 
No one ever told me I was good at anything before her. 
And you never forget your first rich white woman. 
With or without Martha Stewart, we're gonna build our cupcake business and be a success, I just know it. 
How? 
How do you know that? 
I know because you have the talent, I have the vision, and because I feel it. 
I feel it here. 
Oh, blegh! 
Your heart? 
No. My pearls... 
my lucky pearls. 
By lucky, do you mean ugly? 
I've worn these every day since I was evicted from my townhouse. 
This pearl necklace brings me luck. 
You... 
you think your life is lucky? 
This morning you used toilet paper as a coffee filter... 
And then used it as toilet paper. 
I know this sounds silly to you, but there is something about putting on these pearls every day that makes me feel strong, confident, and like anything is possible. 
And as long as I have these lucky... 
Oh, no. 
Oh, no! 
No, no, no, don't freak out. 
Don't freak out. 
We'll get them. 
My pearls! 
My lucky pearls! 
Yes, yes, we have identified the problem. 
Just pick them up. 
Whoa! Looks like 
somebody found breakfast. 
No, Chestnut! 
I'm still using that. 
Well, nothing's gonna work out now. 
Here comes the bad luck. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
Your luck couldn't get any worse. 
Aah! 
Or could it? 
Okay, Earl. 
This is the L-520 Order System touch pad. 
Look how simple. 
See? 
I'm telling you, I can't figure this tricky little thing out. 
Earl, it's an on/off button. 
Oh, slow down. 
It does both? 
Let me just charge this up for you right here. 
Oh. 
This thing has been plugged more than the Kardashian sisters. 
I better check the old wiring in diner first. 
Max, now I feel like everyone's staring at my chest area. 
Well, welcome to my life, every day since I was nine. 
That necklace meant something special to me. 
Didn't you ever lose anything sentimental you had for a long time? 
My mother, but then she found her way back. 
Look, I am done waiting for Martha to call. 
I say we go down there with some cupcakes, remind her how much she liked them, and suggest she puts us on her show. 
No, I mean, I can't go without my pearls. 
And it's more than just the luck. 
It's who I was before I lost everything. 
You know how I always say, "hi, I'm Caroline Channing," and then touch my pearls? 
I'm not just introducing myself. 
I'm reminding myself. 
Well, let me remind you of something else. 
Yesterday you told me we were going to rule the world with cupcakes. 
Yeah, that was the pearls talking. 
Okay, well, now I'm talking. 
There is no luck. 
There is only work. 
And right now, you're working my last nerve. 
So I am going down there myself. 
And if Martha won't help me, I'ma bust her kneecaps with a rolling pin and then say, "Now that's a good thing." 
Okay, what if we just send Martha an email, so we're not just standing in her office, begging some receptionist? 
 That won't do anything. 
 Yes, it will. 
I craft amazing business emails. 
I went to Wharton. 
Please don't, Max. 
That's all I have left. 
Max, Caroline, I found something at the restaurant trade show you might be interested in. 
The only restaurant trade I'm interested in is if we can exchange you for anybody else. 
You won't be laughing in a minute. 
Look, it's a cupcake from the new state-of-the-art cupcake ATM machine. 
Sprinkles cupcakes plans to be put them everywhere. 
Soon, everyone will be able to just push a button, day or night, and get the cupcake. 
So, I guess what I'm saying is, you might be screwed. 
Delicious... 
And no attitude. 
Well, more bad luck. 
I thought you were kidding, but the machines are taking over. 
We can't compete with that. 
The business is done. 
Game over. 
Man, you are never gonna make it in the future. 
This is where the humans fight. 
This is where we march down to Martha Stewart and demand a damn blurb, so we can compete with the machines... 
Just like in "Terminator 2: Rise of the desserts." 
Fine. 
Let's go see Martha. 
She's our only hope. 
My lucky necklace is gone. 
We can no longer just wait for magic to happen. 
Uh, thank you, by the way, for never telling me that our former plan was magic. 
We'll just reintroduce ourselves and our cupcakes to Martha and impress her all over again, even though I'm wearing a necklace that I hate. 
It's limp, anemic, and lackluster. 
I have an Olsen twin around my neck. 
Here. 
What are you doing? 
So Martha will recognize me. 
Hi, excuse me. 
Two questions. 
Which floor is Martha Stewart on? 
And should I lose this necklace? 
Well, your silence speaks volumes. 
Hi, I'm not crazy, so you can just tell me the floor number. 
Elevator right over there, 15th floor, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. 
Just got a little damp. 
Thanks for your help. 
Feels better. 
Smart, getting necklace advice from a guy with no neck. 
Wait. Is that... 
That's the cupcake machine that Han was talking about. 
Ugh, no! 
I was hoping it'd be ugly, but it's pink and really cute. 
It's like a gay R2-D2. 
Well, a gayer R2-D2. 
Who wouldn't want a cupcake from this? 
No one. 
 We have to mess her up. 
 What? 
Why are you carrying spray-paint in your purse? 
For the same reason I carry a tampon. 
'Cause you never know. 
We are not gonna destroy someone else's property. 
Well, we have to do something, 'cause it's that machine or us. 
Oh, I know. 
We can open the little door and put a poop in it. 
Not one of mine. 
Jeez! 
What am I, a pig? 
Well, I'm not doing it. 
No, we just get some puppy poop from the street. 
No! 
We are not that desperate. 
And I'm out of wetnaps. 
No, see, we already met Martha. 
We're just stopping by to say hi. 
You've already met Martha. 
You're just stopping by to say hi. 
Yes. 
Martha Stewart asked us for our card. 
Martha Stewart asked you for your card. 
And where should I tell Martha she asked for your card? 
In the ladies' room. 
Martha Stewart asked you for your card  in the ladies' room. 
 Okay. 
Don't make it sound like that. 
It happened. 
We cornered her in the ladies' room and... 
Okay, don't make it sound like that either. 
We went to a gala on the off chance that she would be gracious enough to try one of our cupcakes and she did. 
She was very gracious. 
Yeah, maybe cornered was the wrong word. 
It's not like we went there to hunt her down. 
It's not like you went there to hunt her down. 
It's not. 
Okay, I hear your tone. 
I see what's going down here. 
You think I'm some kind of a problem. 
Well, for the record, Martha came on to me. 
All right. Okay. 
This is not going as well as we had hoped. 
Don't know how it could without my magic pearls. 
Okay, look. 
I get that you're not gonna let us up there. 
And I don't blame you, what, with this one talking about magic. 
But just so you know, we are not lying. 
It happened. 
And after we hunted her down... 
because, yeah, you got us on that, we did... 
Martha told us she liked our entrepreneurial drive. 
Well, that does sound like Martha. 
Okay, I'll send these up. 
Have a seat. 
Ahh, thank you so much. 
And here, uh, please take one, just so you can see for yourself why Martha asked for our card. 
Well, I was gonna get a cupcake from that cute machine downstairs later. 
Oh, don't. 
I heard someone found something nasty in that... 
In about an hour. 
Max. 
And this is our beer batter maple bacon spring break cupcake. 
Mmm. 
I can see why Martha... 
Ow! 
What the... 
I cracked my tooth! 
What? 
Oh! 
What is that? 
Is it... 
is that glass? 
No, it's a pearl. 
I'm so sorry. 
Sorry? 
You're sorry? 
I've been wearing Invisaligns for 11 months! 
Well, there goes our big break. 
Never would've happened if I had had my necklace. 
The one with the lucky pearls that broke into the batter and that woman just spit into her hand mixed with saliva and blood? 
That lucky necklace? 
Yes. 
Might as well face it. 
You and I are on our own. 
And not just because of Martha either. 
Because there is no such thing as good luck. 
Never seen it. 
And all lucky charms are stupid, except for the lucky charms, which are magically delicious. 
Look at it over there. 
Gay R2-D2 just laughing at us. 
You were right, Max. 
You and I are on our own. 
We're just a little start-up cupcake company in a hard, hard world. 
And we gotta take matters into our own hands. 
Cover me. 
Wait, wait, no. 
No, don't do it now. 
 The guard is right there. 
 Hey, you! 
Stop that! 
 What kind of freaks deface a cupcake machine? 
 Run, run run!. 
Okay, stop, stop, stop. 
We lost him. 
You know you only tagged the wall, right? 
Yes, I have no luck. 
No one has any luck... 
With the possible exception of Lindsay Lohan's lawyer. 
Look, it's Martha! 
She's getting in that car. 
Give me the cupcakes. 
I'm going after her before she talks to that lady whose mouth we broke. 
Max, don't jiggle the cupcakes! 
Aah! 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Max, are you all right? 
Are you all right? 
I'm fine. 
No broken bones, which is surprising, because when I was kid, we couldn't afford milk. 
Actually the only time my mother bought milk was when my face was on the side of the carton. 
Are you sure you're all right? 
Yeah. 
I guess there is such a thing as luck. 
And tomorrow night when you come in for takeout, Sophie, all Max has to do is hit this little thing. 
Well, if I'm allowed to hit little things, you're next. 
Change makes everyone so tense. 
Kitchen is now closed. 
I have plans. 
Big plans. 
Sophie, I understand your relationship with Oleg is complicated, so let's simplify it. 
Are you having sex in our building tonight, and do I have to wear earplugs? 
I will be alone... 
But wear them anyway. 
Hi, um, sorry, we're closed. 
I do not wish to eat. 
I just got collect call from Oleg. 
She said we are closed. 
Oh? 
And who are you? 
I'm the last person you will see before you learn how to walk again. 
Stay away from Oleg, or I'll pull your intestines out through your nose and give them to her to wear as new necklace. 
Fine. 
I will leave. 
But only because you have eyes of a python, and I have possible U.T.I. 
Sophie... 
Why don't you just admit it, you and Oleg? 
What? 
It's not like I want him. 
It's just that where I come from, you never throw anything away. 
Here you go, ladies. 
Enjoy the extra tips from your credit cards, because when Han flips that switch, the only tip I can give you is, don't wash your hair every day. 
It dries it out. 
Okay. 
Here comes the future. 
One, two... 
This old building sucks me so hard. 
Congratulations, ladies. 
This is your lucky night. 
Speaking of luck, here are your pearls. 
I found most of them, but I think Chestnut ate a few. 
You can dig for those later yourself. 
Max. 
And it won't look the same, because you have to string them on this cheap-ass wire I got at the hipster bead store... 
Beading Off. 
We can add this Earl bonus money to our cupcake business total. 
Yeah, that 150 will really put a dent in the 250,000 we need. 
We'll get there, Max. 
Because you and I have something Martha Stewart and machines don't. 
Unpaid bills? 
Mushrooms growing on our bathroom rug? 
No, each other. 
Aww, a year later you're still trying to get me to feel things. 
Do you wanna know the real reason I thought this necklace was so lucky? 
I was wearing it the day I met you. 
So, I'm gonna have some extras do you wanna make one for yourself? 
Nah, I've had plenty of pearl necklaces, and I find them more sticky than lucky. 
Max, ms@marthastewartinc.com. 
"Haven't forgotten about you, girls. 
Martha Stewart." 
Just when I thought I was out, she pulls me back in again. 
Look at all these customers from the Brooklyn midnight ride. 
I smell diner success! 
Really? 'Cause I smell baked crotch. 
Can balls fart? 
Because I feel like I'm smelling that too. 
Where is Oleg with my orders? 
If my tables don't get food soon, they're gonna... 
Oh, my God, they're raising their arms. 
Ugh! Well, we know it wasn't a charity ride 
to raise money for deodorant. 
Oleg, where are my burgers? 
I'm a little in the weeds right now. 
You mean you smoked a little weed right now? 
It's medicinal. 
Helps with my chronic erection. 
Can someone who's not in the grateful dead tell me how we're gonna get food? 
Follow me. 
You do plates, buns, coleslaw. 
I'll do burgers, fries, and any guy who has no future. 
Can you imagine if we were born inside shells, and then even bigger animals cracked us open to eat? 
Fries on the plates! 
Is anybody writing this gold down? 
All right, Oleg. I want in. 
Where's the... 
or the... 
or the... 
Oh, my God, am I deaf? 
Wait, where is it? 
I put it somewhere. 
Ooh, a French fry. 
Hey. I don't know where you guys are 
in your bike training. 
Are we doping or deserting? 
I can help you either way. 
We're thinking about dessert. 
Cool, how about a Max's Homemade Cupcake? 
Eh, I don't think so. 
How's that cherry pie? 
Nice. The family of mice that lives in it 
just renewed their lease. 
So, a Max's Homemade Cupcake? 
You keep saying "Max's Homemade Cupcakes" like it's a thing. 
I've never heard of it. 
I haven't either. And we know a lot. 
And yet you put that headband on this morning. 
 So who's Max? 
 Yeah, who's Max? 
Who's Max? 
She's Lance Armstrong's left nut. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
Caroline, you know I'm not one to gossip, but just about 30 seconds ago, I saw Max drop some major attitude and blow a chance with a possible cupcake customer. 
That's your gossip? 
That Max has an attitude? 
What are you gonna tell me next, that Elton John is gay? 
Anyways, I'm just saying about Max, bitch needs to take it down a notch. 
Bitch needs to mind his own business. 
Max, did you blow a possible cupcake customer tonight? 
You know I don't mix business with pleasure. 
We have to keep pushing our cupcakes. 
Every table, every time, "Max's Homemade Cupcakes." 
I did. 
I said my name to that table more times than my mother said it my entire life. 
But you can't just say the name. 
You have to really sell it.  
You should see me out there. 
"Hope you saved room for one of our delicious Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
They're moist, delicious, creamy..." 
Stop. 
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I am not a whore. 
Oh, you're a cupcake whore, and right now I'm your pimp, so... 
How many did you sell tonight? 
Two. Don't hit me, daddy! 
Okay, how many did you sell tonight? 
I sold... two. 
Okay, we're bad whores. 
No, we are tired whores. 
It's not the end of the world. 
We're just letting a few El caminos drive by because our wrists are sore. 
I love you for that. 
You just put everything into perspective. 
So I says to Caroline, "it's so bad for business." 
And right now they're in the kitchen having huge fight. 
I really worried that... 
Lady Chatterbox says your business is in big trouble. 
Please, everything seems big to Han. 
Ready to go, Sophie? 
And girls, sorry to hear your business broke up and you aren't speaking. 
We scared him. 
Now he's gonna run under the stove. 
I'm gonna make some calls to help you. 
Get you some big party jobs. 
That's so nice of you, Sophie. 
We really appreciate it. 
You girls can make some big money. 
As you know, Duza Day is coming up. 
Um, no, I do not know. 
What the hell is Duza Day? 
Oh, Duza Day is huge holiday in Polish community. 
When a Polish girl reaches six feet, you give her big party. 
I had mine when I was seven. 
Is this private giggling or can anyone join? 
 What are you watching? 
 My favorite show. 
Abby & Brittany, the show about those cute conjoined twins with two heads, one torso? 
Already watched it. 
They fought about a necklace.  
Now I'm watching Cupcake Wars. 
If our team wins Cupcake Wars, we're gonna use the $10,000 prize to finally open up our own storefront. 
Wait, $10,000? What kind of show is this? 
I thought Google eliminated the need to ask questions out loud, but fine. 
It's a show on food network where teams make cupcakes and compete for money. 
And why are we not on it? 
Look at that dumb-dumb! 
She just dropped the pastry bag. 
Hey, they're called hands, learn how to use them, dumb-dumb! 
And that is why we're not on it. 
Not everyone's as judgmental as you. 
Oh, everyone's as judgmental as me. 
And I don't need some snarky bitch pointing at us on her TV going, "oh, look at that blonde dumb-dumb and her hot friend trying to do something." 
Max, why don't you ever let yourself dream? 
Because in my dreams, spiders are always eating my eyes. 
This might be the big push we need. 
We can go on Cupcake Wars, or we can keep being cupcake whores. 
Think about it. 
We wouldn't have to go car-to-car anymore, we could actually open a brothel. 
Wait, if brothel's on the table, why don't we just forget about this cupcake thing? 
'Cause that's a job I can do without pants. 
Seriously. Let's at least go to 
the food network and apply. 
That's not how it works. 
You fill out an application online, submit a two-minute home video, and then wait eight to ten days for a response. 
Huh, caught you dreaming. 
All right, so maybe I thought about it for, like, a second, when we first became a team. 
But then I remembered the world's a dead-end and nothing good happens ever to anyone. 
There's a gun in that drawer. 
Do you want to just kill ourselves? 
Oh, Max. 
You finally called us a team. 
We are so going on that show. 
Seriously, I don't know how Abby and Brittany do it, because I'm uncomfortable with you even sitting this close to me. 
Well, if we're making an audition tape to be on a reality show called, "the world's most uncomfortable t-shirt," we have already won. 
Yes, I could have gotten us a more expensive shirt at American Apparel, but then we would just look like people pretending to be poor. 
And 13, and probably in the sex trade. 
I cannot believe you used your flat iron to put these letters on. 
Well, I can't believe you once used it to make a panini, but... that's what happens now. 
Where's the scissors? 
I gotta give this thing  some flave. 
 Max, what are you doing? 
Crew necks are for squares and mormons. 
Oh, cute! Should we do mine? 
I don't know. 
If you have no car, why open the garage? 
So, I thought we'd shoot it over here in our adorable, scrappy, low-income kitchen. 
Why are you talking like that? 
Because that's our brand. 
I've watched a ton of Cupcake Wars, and it's a lot about branding. 
And what are we? 
The girl who knows how to make cupcakes and the girl who doesn't? 
Max, I'm not worried about that. 
You'll just tell me what to do, like you always do, and we'll be the two scrappy girls with so little you can't help but love them. 
I hate them already. 
Okay, that's Oleg. 
You did tell him he's filming us for an audition and not making a porno, right? 
Yeah, I made it very clear. 
Why are your tops still on? 
And why isn't the plastic down? 
You're gonna get oil everywhere. 
Oleg, Max told you we're not gonna make that kind of movie. 
I know, but so did every girl that I worked with on "Backdoor Brides." 
And then again on "Backdoor Brides Two." 
But five minutes later, it was "Here comes the bride." 
Oh, good. 
You still have your tops on. 
Yeah, they don't have to make girl-on-girl porn film for money. 
I got you big Duza Day party. 
300 cupcakes! 
Oh, my God! That's $1,200. 
No, it's for free. 
You do it for connections, and for the hot and cold pierogi buffet. 
Oh, Sophie, I don't know if we should be taking free work right now. 
We're doing this TV thing, and if we get it, we don't know what our schedule will be. 
Oh, I didn't know I was talking to Cagney and Lacey. 
Yeah, well, suit yourself. 
We're sorry, Sophie. 
You have every right to be mad. 
Would a cupcake help? 
Always. 
Well, I just texted the third girl not to come, so let's get this over with. 
This is so exciting. We're gonna be great. 
 We got this, girl. 
 Okay, stop. 
On every reality show, people say lame things that we can never say. 
No fist bumping. No high fives. 
You can't tell me to "bring it," "shut it down," or "put our cupcake business on the map." 
You can't tell me to "go, girl"" or "bring my 'a' game," and we don't "got this." Cool? 
Cool. 
 But we do got this, right? 
 Yeah, we got this. 
Okay, here we go, girls. 
Arch your backs. Sorry, force of habit. 
Action. 
Hey, what's up? I'm Max, 
and this is my partner, Caroline. 
And we're Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
And by homemade, I mean, "Ho!-Made." 
You go, girl! 
 We are an online bakery... 
 Well, we have a website. 
And we're based right here in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
And this is where the magic happens. 
This is our kitchenslash living room-slash-my bedroom... 
Slash my wrists, 'cause I'm trying to bake all night while she's sleeping over there. 
And here is our purple stove. 
Just because you're poor, that doesn't mean you can't have style. 
Or a horse that just came in unannounced. 
Oh, this is Chestnut. 
He's our test audience. 
But we don't feed him chocolate. 
'Cause that would kill him. 
They have a horse! 
So pick us because we're hard workers, we love the show, and we're females getting their own, on their own. 
And cut! That was so great. 
Chestnut walking in out of nowhere, we could not have planned that. 
Oh, but I did. 
That's our gimmick. Try to beat that. 
Two girls with a horse. 
And how is this not a porn film? 
* I knew it, we got it * * I knew it, I saw it! * 
Is this how you imagined it when you were laughing at all the dumb-dumbs on cupcake wars? 
I cannot believe I am auditioning to be on Cupcake Wars. 
I am on the show I watch! 
Life is totally awesome. 
Good morning. I'm the Cupcake Wars 
talent coordinating producer, Janis. 
You are awesome. Your show's awesome. 
Who would I talk to about getting a mug to take home? 
Not a gift shop. 
Janis, hi, I'm Caroline, and this is my partner, Max. 
Loved your tape. Great characters. 
 We are? 
 We are. 
Look, we're about to start with the team intros. 
The other team is up first and then you. 
And remember to B.Y.O.B. 
Oh, if I had known I was allowed to bring a bottle in, I wouldn't have chugged it in the bathroom. 
Max, that's not what she meant. 
The food network is very pg. 
Janis, B.Y.O.B.? 
"Bring your own brand." 
Just like you did on your home tape. 
You're edgy with big boobs. 
You're the "try hard." 
I'm sorry, I'm the what? 
That's your brand. 
The muscle and the hustle. 
The double-d's and the ditz. 
I went to wharton. I'm not a ditz. 
Well you ain't the double-d's. 
Can you believe she openly commented on m'goods? 
All right, we're ready for team one. 
Step up. 
You have 30 seconds. 
Okay, cute aprons. But what's their brand? 
In five, four, three, two... 
 Hi, I'm Felicia. 
 And I'm Blanche, and we're representing the Crescent City. 
We're talking about New Orleans, y'all! 
Cute accents, but no one has a scrappier story than us. 
Back in 2005, when hurricane Katrina hit... 
Say what? 
And the levee broke and flooded our whole neighborhood. 
Say what? 
Our community was devastated, and we thought, "hell yes, Katrina hit us hard." 
"But hell no! We're not giving up." 
We needed to find a way to keep on keepin' on. 
Katrina? Their brand is Katrina? 
Even m'goods can't upstage that. 
We want to win Cupcake Wars so we can finally open a storefront in our little neighborhood. 
Make our business official. 
Yeah, and find a way to put money back into our community. 
That's what we're all about at... 
Neighbor Cakes! 
Boom!  
Great, great. 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes, you're up. 
Why did we name the company after me? 
"Neighbor Cakes" versus "Max's narcissistic cupcakes"? 
We're fine. Don't freak out. 
Just do our thing, like we did at home. 
No need to panic. 
In five, four, three, two... 
Yo, what's up? 
I'm Max, of Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
They're "Ho-made." Ha! Get it? 
'Cause she's a ho! 
She's got the boobs, and I've got the brains, right, Max? 
Uh, kind of. 
We bake at home in our apartment, which is... 
Is a disaster area. Really, it's a mess. 
And we don't have our rent. 
The rent is high. * not gonna lie * 
* we hung out to dry, neither has a guy * Yo, what up, Cupcake Wars? Right, Max? 
I don't even know what's happening. 
We bake because I lost all my money and her mom drinks. 
Oh, I'm Caroline... and, cut. 
Okay. Well, okay. 
Did I just freestyle rap? 
Yes. 
And you also called our apartment a disaster in front of two ladies whose apartments washed away. 
Hi. Everything okay over here? 
Yep. Ditz and double-d's, on track. 
B.Y.O.B. 
Great. Can we all gather 
to reveal the secret ingredients? 
 What's it gonna be? 
 It could be anything. 
I once saw a St. Patrick's 
day theme where a team made a beer and lucky charms cupcake. 
That's right up your alley. I hope it's that. 
Today's theme is... 
 Soul food. 
 Whoo! 
Ooh, we got this, sister! 
 Sister, this is gotten. 
 Whoohoo! 
Some of the ingredients include okra, molasses, collard Greens, sweet potato, buttermilk, chicken, and ham hock. 
Ham hock? 
Isn't that a character in The Hobbit? 
In three, two... 
Here we go, girl! 
Sister, we are screwed. 
We can do our sweet potato mash cupcake. 
Ooh, with peanut molasses drizzle. 
Gumbo cupcake! Gumbo cupcake! 
What are we gonna do? 
I don't know. 
 What are you looking at? 
 The camera. 
* New Orleans, New Orleans * * we got this, gumbo cupcakes * Good luck, Caroline. 
Stop it, Max. What's wrong with you? 
 It's happening. We're the dumb 
 dumbs! 
We are not the dumb-dumbs. 
I went to Wharton. 
All we have to do is pick three ingredients. 
And we're ready to pop them in the oven! 
How can they already be going in the oven? 
 Oh, that gives me an idea! 
 What? 
Put me in the oven! 
Okay, okay. We just have to start. 
It'll come to us. 
Bring it all. Ugh. 
Just my luck to get soul food when I don't even have a soul. 
* New Orleans, New Orleans * * we got this, gumbo cupcakes * That is not catching on! 
So, what are you thinking, Max? 
* New Orleans, New Orleans * I was wrong, it is catching on. 
Stop thinking that. 
Start thinking about the ingredients, while I do the baking. 
I've seen you do it a million times. 
We just need milk, right, Max? 
We got this. * gumbo cupcakes * 
Here's the milk. 
So, I'll just pour this milk into this mixer. 
It looks like I'm baking, right, Max? 
Whoa! Watch what you're doing! 
It's flooding! It's flooding! 
Oh, great, you said "flooding." 
What's next, "FEMA?" "Superdome?" 
This is a disaster. 
We are the worst team ever. 
We are not. What are you doing? 
Putting shrimp in my pocket to take home. 
We gotta get something out of this. 
Just start tasting this stuff so we can figure out what we're making. 
That tastes like a foot! 
And now I'm using some flour. 
We use flour when we bake. 
Right, Max? 
Oh, that is hot. 
Ooh, that's too hot. 
That is hot as the devil's ass! 
Oh, my mouth is on fire. 
Where's that foot thing? 
Ahh, oh, ahh. 
Move over, I'll help you. What is this? 
It's vanilla. 
It's sweet, Max! It's sweet. 
Now we just have to pick something else. 
There, ham. 
We're making a vanilla ham cupcake. 
That's it! Vanilla ham! 
You're a vanilla ham! 
Good, insult me! 
Yes, you're coming out of it, Max, here we go. 
We're not going anywhere. 
I'm on my show and I'm losing. 
Forget we're on the show. 
Pretend we're in the diner, and Oleg is stoned, and we have all these ingredients and we just got slammed with people who all want cupcakes. 
What do you tell me to do? 
Well, first, I tell you to leave so I can get stoned with Oleg. 
Okay, if I was stoned, what would I know about soul food? 
Ludacris! 
Is always talking about how much he loves waffles with chicken. 
Chicken and waffle cupcake! 
Yes! Chicken and waffles! 
You better watch it, girls. 
Here comes chicken and waffles from big boobs and try hard. 
As Ludacris would say, move, bitch, get out the way. 
Let's go, girl. We gotta bring it. 
We gotta shut this down. We 
are bringing our "a" game. 
It's time to put our cupcake business on the map. 
We got this. Oh, my God. 
I said them all.  
Empty the mixer. We still have time. 
Oh! 
Look at the blonde dumb-dumb. 
Congratulations, Max! 
Sophie, we didn't get it. 
Oh, congratulations, Caroline! 
Sophie, I told you, we didn't get picked. 
What am I supposed to do, walk around with a purse full of confetti? 
I'm so sorry, ladies. 
But you know what they say, when God closes a door, you work here. 
It just wasn't our day. 
We got flustered at first, but we did end up making a great cupcake. 
Oh, say it. 
We got hit by hurricane Katrina. 
True. Hard to believe, 
but the other team had a better brand. 
Oh, please. 
Blaming it on a disaster from years ago. 
Well, Sophie, you weren't there, so I don't think you... 
Oh, I don't want to hear it! 
I mean, you had huge opportunity with Duza Day. 
But you passed on the real job waiting for your big break on the TV show, just like everyone else in America. 
So you tried to take a shortcut to success and you end up with a mouth full of confetti. 
Sophie's right. 
We went on television with the ridiculous expectation that we'd make it overnight. 
But that's not who we are. 
We're gonna have to do it the hard way. 
Slow and steady. The 
tortoise and the whore. 
Well, what can I say, "caramel?" 
By the way, that's your whore name. 
Looks like it's back to selling cakes one car at a time. 
I'll just put these "Ludacris Specials" in the display case. 
You do that, "Cinnamon." 
Oh, no, I actually have a whore name, and that's not it. 
What is it? 
Max. Duh. 
Uhm... what's happening right now? 
Max, are you smoking crack? 
It's not crack. It's lipstick. 
I can't afford crack. 
I'm at the end of my good lipstick and I can't afford to buy a new one so I'm going all Breaking Bad. 
"Breaking Bad"? 
We're more like broke and sad. 
You're freebasing lipstick and look, this heel is starting to wobble. 
Here, stick this in and hold it. 
I swear I've said that before, but I don't think it was about shoes. 
Yo, dollface. 
It's been ten minutes! 
His chowder, my spaghetti. 
Where's the food? 
"Where's the food"? 
Where's your neck? 
I wasn't listening. 
I was looking at your boobs. 
Well, I do what I can but they'll never be as big as yours. 
Pick up. 
Meatball. 
Hey, hot stuff. 
Where's the hot stuff? 
Oh, Max. 
You were right. 
This heel is much more--no. 
No, wait! 
No, it's not. 
It's gonna Those are the biggest balls those guys have had in their laps since they started steroids. 
I can't believe you masking taped the shoe to your leg. 
I know but these are Christian Louboutins and even all busted up like this they still have the classic red bottoms. 
You know what else has red bottoms? 
Baboons. 
Walk around with a couple of them on your feet and I'm impressed. 
Well, at least now you can't see those stupid bows. 
Who put bows on their shoes? 
What's the gift? 
Your stinky feet? 
You don't think I hate the bows? 
I bought these as an impulse purchase over a year ago. 
I didn't know I'd be shackled with them for eternity. 
Oh, Caroline. 
I never noticed you had a club foot. 
I would have set you up with my brother. 
I broke my shoe in the diner. 
Oh, I can help. 
I always carry my gym shoes in my bag. 
I'm sorry they're so conservative but the weight room is a real meat rack. 
Sophie, that's so sweet of you. 
But I still have one pair of my own shoes to wear. 
Oh, well take them just in case. 
You should take them. 
You'll make $20 just walking to work. 
And some of your mail got mixed in with mine. 
This is like the third time that mail lady did that. 
All right. 
Nighty night. 
Max, you will not believe what just came addressed to you. 
Let me explain. 
I'm not a scientologist. 
I just went that one time because I heard some rich guy was looking for a wife. 
No, we've been pre-approved for a credit card. 
What? 
How the hell did we get pre-approved? 
It says all we have to do is go online and apply and we can be approved in under two minutes. 
Slow down, Quasimodo. 
I can't have a credit card. 
Someone gave me a bag of Chips Ahoy! cookies once 
and I ate the entire thing without breathing. 
Well, you're not a child any more. 
You have more discipline. 
The cookies were yesterday. 
Okay, what is that thing? 
What is that spinning wheel? 
It's just processing our application. 
No, it's not. 
It's finding out everything about us. 
Now it's finding out your dad stole millions of dollars. 
Now it's finding out I got fired from eight Dairy Queens. 
Now it's finding out why I got fired from eight Dairy Queens. 
Oh, my God. 
Max, we're approved. 
We've just been approved. 
What? What is wrong with them? 
Does Dairy Queen report nothing? 
Get back on there and disapprove us. 
Okay. 
Calm down. 
We need this card for our business. 
All we have to do is communicate with each other about every purchase, you know? 
Keep an open dialogue. 
So, opening dialogue. 
For our business, I would like a pair of Louboutins. 
Opening dialogue. 
No. 
And I felt stupid miming that. 
I hate the arts. 
Look, you can't get everything you want. 
I would like a box of lizards. 
Love lizards, always have, but you don't see me putting that on a credit card. 
I need a new pair of shoes for business meetings. 
You know what they say, "dress for the job you want, not the job you have". 
Okay, fine. 
If you're getting the shoes, then I'm getting what I want. 
I hope you're happy with an apartment full of lizards and lipstick. 
Also, some of those lizards will be wearing lipstick. 
Earl, you are looking particularly gorgeous this evening. 
Well, I would say, "don't flatter me" but let's face it. 
Everything came together tonight. 
Is it another woman? 
Should I be filled with anger? 
I mean, more than I usually am? 
I just want to look nice for my son when he comes in. 
What? No way, 
I'm going to meet your kid? 
Well, one of them. 
"One of them"? 
How many do you have? 
So far? 
Oh, Earl, I love you. 
This is my son, Darius. 
He's the number one Chrysler salesman in all of Detroit, and he's my very favorite, if he's the one I'm thinking of. 
Excuse me, but aren't you Max of Max's Homemade Cupcakes? 
Earl, look. 
Our credit card came in the mail today. 
See? 
"Max Black". 
No more using the card I found at Six Flags. 
Thank you for never checking your statement, Agnes Chin. 
Girls, take my advice and be very careful with that thing. 
Credit cards are more trouble than a priest at a Wiggles concert. 
Yes, Earl. 
I can't believe it. 
A credit card for our business. 
So when are we getting the shoes and lizards? 
Max, remember. 
We have to be grown-ups about this. 
Of course. 
"Two lizards, please. 
No, make it three." 
Hi, I'm looking for Earl. 
And no, I'm not here to return a bag of skunky weed. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm so excited to see you. 
Come on in, I'll take really, really good care of you. 
Oh, you need to know I just separated from my wife, so I'm a little vulnerable. 
She's not usually this nice to customers. 
She's just excited. 
She's about to come into some lizards. 
Yeah, again. 
I've been out the dating pool for a while, so everything sound like a sexual innuendo to me. 
He is not a customer. 
Look at him. 
Don't you see the resemblance? 
Oh, my God is he your father? 
Yes. 
He's my father. 
And my mother is a piece of chalk. 
Daddy! 
Thank God, it is the one I thought. 
There's my little boy! 
So, Darius, what was Earl like as a dad? 
It must have been great, huh? 
I bet he packed the coolest lunches. 
A joint for recess, and a gin and juice box. 
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
He was a great dad. 
I mean, he was always there. 
Except for my childhood. 
You've gotta laugh! 
Earl is sitting right there. 
Well, it's a joke. 
Take it easy there, fun size. 
Han, take no offense. 
He's just pulling your leg a little. 
Darius has always been funny. 
Why am I thinking about Terrence? 
I don't know. 
I'm the funny one, Dad. 
I don't recall there being a Terrence in our family, but then again, I don't know how far you've thrown your seed. 
You've gotta laugh. 
Do you? 
Darius was voted the funniest salesman at the Chrysler dealership. 
Yes, I was. 
And that's why I quit my job. 
To pursue my dream to become a comedian. 
See? 
See, he's funny. 
Always making jokes. 
That's not a joke, Daddy. 
No, no, that's why I'm in town. 
To audition at the comedy club tomorrow night. 
I already got my stage name. 
"Darius The Hilarious". 
I think it's a good choice, right? 
Is it? 
Well, obviously, Big D, we will all be there to support you. 
Will we? 
Hold up, Darius. 
How did all of this happen? 
Well, I mean, I knew a guy at Cadillac who knew a guy at Toyota who knew a guy at Subaru who sold the club owner a Dodge. 
And then he hit a kid with it. 
The kid should have dodged. 
You gotta laugh! 
There's a dead kid in the mix and we got to laugh? 
It's not his fault he's not funny. 
We put his sense of humor on a high shelf. 
Hey, Max, you know, Daddy always told me you were special, and now I see it. 
And it's not just because you think everything I say is funny. 
You feel like family. 
I do? Oh, I always 
wanted a brother... 
Who was a brother. 
Max, do you expect me to wait on all the tables tonight? 
Well, I am kind of in the middle of my family reunion right now. 
And where is Mr. Hilarious' soup? 
Look at blondie, here. 
She's like, "Oh my God, do black people even eat soup?" 
"It's like, whatever." 
That is a dead-on Caroline. 
Is it? 
Here is your order ticket from tonight. 
This pile is for the people who found hair. 
These are the hairs that the people found. 
Oh, you sound Russian. 
That's funny because you're not rushin' to make my soup. 
No, no, no, no. 
I'm kidding you, man. 
I get it. 
You're just too busy back there not putting on deodorant. 
You gotta laugh. 
Do you? 
Max, I might be crazy but now I feel like the heel of this shoe's starting to Oh, gosh. 
Now I got to go wipe this down. 
You know, I was going to wear this for my audition. 
And that's gotta go well. 
Yes, it does. 
Because son, there are two jobs in Detroit, and you just quit one of them. 
Don't worry, Daddy. 
I'll make you proud. 
All right? 
You'll see. 
Daddy's been wrong before. 
He didn't think I could make it on Soul Train, but there I was, in the bottom left corner on Soul Train. 
I feel so terrible. 
Well, you know we have to buy him a new shirt. 
Max, I've made seven dollars so far. 
We can't afford to buy him a shirt. 
We can go shopping for a reasonable shirt. 
We have to. 
He's family. 
Is he? 
And I have to say, I don't like that brand of put-down humor. 
And that blonde stereotype? 
I mean, I don't even say "whatever". 
But, you know, it's fine. 
Whatever. 
Max, slow down. 
I can't walk any faster in Sophie's giant sneakers. 
I can't believe she benches 250 in these. 
Oh, my God. 
My hand just touched the subway floor. 
How do I know someone didn't pee here? 
Oh, honey, I've peed here. 
This is New York. 
It's made of pee. 
And pee hand is what you get for refusing to wear flat shoes. 
No way. 
I'm living so close to the gutter as it is. 
I can't risk being any shorter. 
Here's where we're meeting Darius. 
"Subway Style". 
Every time I walk by this place I wonder "who would ever shop here?" 
Now I know--us. 
First my heel breaks, and now I'm shopping underground. 
How much lower can I get? 
Brunch on the earth's core? 
Mmm, oh. 
Excuse my mouthful. 
Mm, I wasn't expecting ladies. 
We usually just sell to pimps and pastors. 
What can I help you dolls with? 
Actually, we're just here meeting a friend. 
We're going to help him pick out a shirt. 
Oh, that guy? 
He's already in the dressing room trying one on now. 
Now, listen, if the price is too high, you and I can, uh, negotiate. 
Or you. 
I still can't believe we're using our tip money to buy him a shirt. 
We're only going to spend like $40. 
And you heard the man. 
It can go down. 
If you go down. 
Oh, hey ladies. 
There you are. 
Look, I switched it up a little bit. 
Do you like me in pink? 
My boyfriend does. 
He says it makes my cheeks look rosy, all four of them. 
You gotta laugh, you gotta laugh! 
Darius, we're family, so I'm just going to tell you like it is. 
That material feels a little funky. 
I mean, that kind of humor might have worked over at Toyota  It's Chrysler. 
 Whatever. 
But this is New York. 
There are a lot of people, be them gays, or blondes, who might take offense to that. 
I mean, I don't, but, whatever. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
I was just playing. 
That's not the kind of stuff I'm gonna do in my act tonight. 
No, I wrote some real jokes with a comic back home. 
And, he's Jewish, so you know it's gonna be funny. 
And not cheap. 
Again, see? 
That's the kind of stuff... 
Caroline, come on. 
It's so wrong it's right. 
Look, I have the jokes right here. 
Let's take them on a little test drive and see how they do. 
All right? 
So back it up, ladies. 
You going to need some laughing room. 
This is going to be hilarious. 
Anybody here have a Smart Car? 
Because I don't think it's smart to drive half a car. 
That was new, I'll keep working on it. 
All right, let's try another one. 
You know what, maybe we weren't back far enough. 
Yeah! 
Yeah, that feels funnier already, right Caroline? 
All right. 
You know who doesn't drive a Smart Car? 
Smart people. 
They don't do it. 
You gotta laugh. 
Seriously. 
You've got to. 
I've got a lot riding on this. 
I just got it. 
Oh, my God. 
He stinks. 
He stinks on ice. 
Darius is gonna bomb tonight and worse, he's going to bomb in front of Earl. 
And Earl's pretty sure that's the son he's most proud of. 
You're right. 
What are we gonna do? 
Now I know you lovely ladies came in for a shirt, but can I interest you in a nice suit? 
Look at this one. 
It's a classic. 
You can't get this color above ground. 
That's it. 
Darius needs a suit. 
All the professional comedians wear suits, and like you said, you have to dress for the job you want. 
And with jokes like that, he needs the funniest suit they have. 
Do you have anything from the Sinbad collection? 
I do. 
Max, I don't think the suit's gonna be enough. 
I think he needs something else, you know, like, a puppet. 
A puppet? 
That's exactly what he needs. 
I went out with a guy last night. 
Asked me if we could go Dutch. 
I said, "I don't know." 
"What's Dutch for cheap-ass bitch?" 
You kick him to the curb! 
We'll be right back, because Mama's gotta go put her feet up. 
Uh, miss? 
Can we get another round when you get a chance? 
Another round? 
And keep them coming until we can no longer see. 
Put it on my card. 
You got it. 
Man, that feels good every time. 
Hey, Max. 
Just because you're buying me drinks doesn't mean I'm going to put out. 
My celery stick is my microphone at the comedy club! 
I'm here, I'm here. 
Did you get the puppet? 
Oh, I've got the puppet. 
Hey, come on in. 
Hey, girls. 
How you doing? 
Darius The Hilarious is pumped. 
I'm totally in my zone right now. 
And I can't miss in this suit. 
Well... 
Darius, that's what we wanted to talk to you about. 
 You know we're big fans. 
 Big, big fans. 
You're amazing, your act's incredible. 
Your Darius The Hilarious. 
Max and I love the Smart Car stuff. 
It's hilarious, per your name. 
But, well, it is New York. 
Not a lot of people are smart, or have cars. 
Yeah, you know New York. 
Not exactly the cutting edge. 
So, after Max and I left you, we had a thought. 
We got you a puppet. 
And, yes, I was stoned. 
But Caroline was laughing just as hard as me. 
You got me a what? 
A puppet. 
We got you a puppet. 
But I don't use a puppet. 
Until you do. 
Just imagine, at the end of your act  or in the beginning... 
 Or all the way through. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Darius The Hilarious and his partner, Justin Beaver! 
"Damn, girl. 
And I mean dam." 
"As in, I built one." 
And you don't even have to be funny because Justin Beaver does the work for you. 
Show him, Max. 
"I'm straight". 
You gotta laugh! 
Do I? 
I mean, honestly? 
Making fun of Justin beaver's Sexuality? 
I find that a tad offensive. 
This next act comes to us from the Motor City. 
Please give it up for Mr. Darius The Hilarious. 
All right. 
How's everybody doing tonight? 
Who out there has a Smart Car? 
Because I don't think it's smart to drive a half a car. 
You gotta laugh. 
Oh, no. 
I ran out of fake laughter. 
Yeah, I mean, Smart Car. 
Have you seen this thing? 
It's like you driving around in a backpack. 
You gotta laugh. 
Do we? 
Why don't we have a Smart Car write some jokes for you? 
Yeah, well, I can see why you would defend the Smart Car. 
It's the only car your feet can reach the pedals in. 
Yeah, but that's so true. 
He's very short! 
As is the car. 
It all lines up. 
Look at this gray-haired scrub, man. 
Apparently black do crack. 
Hey, Don King called. 
Said he want his whole head back. 
Max, look. 
Look how proud Earl is. 
Hey, hey, hey, blondie. 
You mind not talking until I finish? 
Wait, a minute. 
You're probably just thinking, "Oh, my God. Shoes, shoes, 
hairbrush, shoes." 
Oh, my God. 
I actually was thinking about shoes! 
I'm sorry, there's a problem with your card. 
It's been declined. 
Max. 
Darius told me what you did and that was awful nice of you. 
Now, here. 
I am reimbursing you for all of the clothes and for that damn puppet. 
Although I swore I would never pay for beaver. 
Do you think he'll ever make it, Earl? 
Who's to say nowadays, Max? 
America's Got Talent. 
Do they? 
All I know is he's my kid, and you went out of your way to try and help him. 
Well, I just wanted you to be proud. 
I am, Max. 
Very proud. 
I just talked to Visa. 
I think they were disappointed they had pre-approved us. 
Look, I killed it. 
I had to. 
It was telling me to buy a Harley. 
Okay, open dialogue. 
I used the credit card for one more thing yesterday. 
Open dialogue. 
So did I. 
It's the fanciest lipstick Payless had. 
Aw. 
And here. 
Max, are there lizards in that bag? 
I wish. 
They're as good as new and no bows. 
Max, where'd you find a cobbler? 
A cobbler? 
I took a time machine. 
I was supposed to kill Hitler, but I thought your shoes were more important. 
Okay, let's cut up your card. 
We should keep one for business emergencies. 
We just have to have to put it someplace where we'll never be tempted to reach for it. 
Oleg, would you put this down your pants? 
No problem. 
Look at all these people just sitting here and not tipping, working on their computers. 
This guy has a brand-new Apple. 
I've been eating the same apple for a week. 
I blame Steve Jobs. 
These people are more like Steve-I-have-no-jobs. 
All right, that's it. 
Earl, I need to get the wireless router. 
Oh, is that what this is? 
I thought it was a cookie-warmer. 
Attention deadbeat diners. 
You can't just sit here all night and only order coffee. 
This is not a Starbucks. 
And I know that because we don't sell Norah Jones CDs or bananas. 
This is the router for the free Wi-Fi. 
And that is a waitress who needs to make some tips. 
Seriously, guys, I need actual cash. 
This guy just offered to pay me in ideas. 
If I pull this plug, the Internet will go down. 
And you--that sad email you're in the middle of writing to your ex-boyfriend, the one you shouldn't send anyway--gone. 
And you that vaguely pornographic anime film you've been illegally downloading for the past three hours gone. 
And you--that screenplay you've been writing, you can keep working on it, but we all know how it ends: With you moving back in with your mother. 
Now, who's gonna order? 
Great, I'll go get some menus. 
Here, Caroline, put this back. 
Ooh, my cookie-warmer. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Table ten just ordered cocktails. 
Yeah, 'cause we're that kind of a place. 
Does anyone know how to make sex on the beach? 
Easy. 
I put on my speedo and wait. 
Those girls have been drinking for hours. 
Just press every button on the gun and add rum. 
Look at them. 
Not a care in the world. 
Having a great time. 
 I hate them. 
 I hate them, too. 
I hate them more. 
I hate that you hate them more. 
So jealous. 
Okay, ready for party of four. 
Excuse me. 
Pardon me. 
Excuse me. 
Hey, baby! 
Looking good. 
Mm, always. 
I'll be in my booth. 
Sophie, you cannot take up a whole booth alone. 
There are people waiting. 
You must leave. 
Go stand in the corner now! 
Before I bend you across my knee and spank you in front of the whole class. 
Well, I was going to stand in the corner anyway. 
But tomorrow night, smaller table. 
Go stand in the corner now! 
Okay, I'm over being jealous of them. 
Still? What are they 
sitting on vibrators? 
Let it go. 
They're not having that good of a time. 
No, Max, we're not having that good of a time. 
All we do is work. 
When's the last time we took a day and just had fun? 
I mean, those two idiots remind me how much fun it was when I'd go out to lunch and have cocktails with my girlfriends and watch them pretend to eat. 
I think you're talking about day-drinking, and I think I like it. 
All right, let's do something fun. 
I'll put on my bolo tie and my best vest and take my girl out to eat. 
So, what is this lunch spot you're taking me to? 
Is it French? 
Do you think the chef will send an amuse-bouche to the table? 
No, but this morning I shaved a smiley face into my bouche, and it's very amusing. 
You know what? 
It's just so fun to get dressed up and have someone wait on us for a change. 
I even bought new panty hose from dooahnay rayahdey. 
You mean Duane Reade? 
Oh, is that how you pronounce it? 
Well, we're here. 
Better get in line. 
Oh, there's a line. 
Popular place. 
What's the name? 
"Soup Kitchen." 
That's a cute name. 
Very Williamsburg. 
Like, "let's take our upscale urban bistro" "And make it seem like it's just a soup kitchen "open to everyone, but it's not really a soup kitchen." 
Oh, that's nice. 
They let them use the bathroom. 
And sit at a table. 
Oh, my God! 
This is really a soup kitchen. 
This is your idea of treating me to lunch? 
We're not homeless. 
No, but we are soup-less. 
And it's not just homeless people who eat here. 
Okay, maybe they're the target audience. 
Look, there's a lot of other people who can't afford to go out to eat. 
You're right. 
Why are there so many hipsters here? 
Because this place isn't just for people who don't have jobs, it's for people who don't want them. 
Well, it does smell good. 
Excuse me. 
We'd like to take a look at your lunch menu. 
Menu changes every day. 
Also, there is no menu. 
There's, like, four things. 
Oh, okay. 
So what do you recommend? 
Oh, what do I recommend? 
Don't share needles, and and use condoms. 
But you didn't hear that last one from me. 
Are nuns even allowed to be sarcastic? 
If they are, I have some serious thinking to do about my future. 
This sloppy Joe is the most amazing terrible thing I've ever eaten. 
I love that it's basically pre-chewed, so all you really have to do is swallow. 
So good, I used to have these every day when I was a kid. 
Well, then I guess your childhood  wasn't all that bad. 
 Mm. 
We couldn't afford the real Manwich Mix, so my mom's boyfriend, Dirty Carl, used to bring us leftover meat scraps and then bash 'em together with old ketchup packets he'd found in cars at the junkyard. 
Now I understand why you think this is a nice restaurant. 
Have you noticed the more you drink, the better this place gets? 
I've noticed the more I drink, the better everything gets. 
Why don't we drink every day? 
Some of we do. 
I'm having a great time. 
Thank you, Max. 
Well, yesterday, you were so bummed about your life, I thought I'd take you somewhere you could feel good about yourself. 
Okay, I've been wanting to say this the whole time. 
I feel like we're the hottest people in this room. 
 Is that terrible? 
 Yes. 
Speaking of hot people... 
Wait. 
Are we drunk or do we finally have one brain  and the same taste in guys? 
 I don't know, but this is suddenly my new favorite restaurant. 
Let's go get ourselves some of that man-wich. 
I kind of like "drunk Caroline" way more than the other Caroline. 
I kind of like her better, too. 
Excuse me, sisters. 
Do you know the guy who just came in here? 
 The cute one. 
 He's so cute, right? 
His name is Andy, and he just opened a candy store across the way. 
Shut up! 
Candy? 
I love candy. 
Question: What would make this day even better? 
Candy? 
You should totally go for the hot guy. 
Or you can go for him. 
Let's think about this. 
He's clean and not a drug addict, so he's more my type. 
Well, he's got a store full of candy and a penis, so he's more my type. 
You know what? 
Go for it. 
You've got dibs. 
Aww, that's so nice of you, Max. 
Yeah, and while you're doing him in the back room, I'll be pocketing some candy. 
Oh, no. 
It's closed. 
Hey, Max, you know what'd be fun? 
If we threw that trash can through the front window? 
I was gonna say we should leave him a note. 
And what would be fun about throwing that can through a window? 
Have you ever done it? 
It's fun! 
Oh, the sign's turned around. 
He can see us. 
He's smiling at us. 
Should we go in? 
If I learned anything as a child, it's when a stranger offers you candy, you say yes. 
Hi. 
We thought the sign said you were closed. 
Yeah, I turned it around. 
I wanted you guys to come in. 
 Come with me  and you'll be  in world of pure imagination  If this isn't your thing, I also have some Sabbath and some Beastie Boys. 
So, if this is "Candy Andy's Sweets and Treats," are you Candy Andy? 
Oh, please. 
We hardly know each other. 
Call me Candrew Andrew. 
I'm Caroline, and this is Max. 
Max, say something. 
Can't. 
It's all too wonderful. 
Look at all the candy crammed in this little space. 
It's like we're inside Willy Wonka's colon. 
Thanks. 
Yeah, it's kind of the look I was going for too. 
And I know it's accurate because I had the Oompa Loompas help me. 
They were expensive, but what are you gonna doom-pa-dee-doo? 
Normally I'd ring the bell after something that golden, but I don't want to scare you. 
Well, now I have to hear the bell. 
 Anything you want to Now that's all I want to hear. 
Do you do free samples? 
You do, by the way. 
Let me hook you guys up. 
On the house. 
Marry this guy right now. 
It's a small store. 
I can hear you. 
Good. 
Moves things along faster. 
Hey, come by the Williamsburg diner sometime. 
We work there. 
We'll give you free samples of food you shouldn't have to pay for anyway. 
So, what brings you in to this neighborhood? 
Oh, we were having lunch at the this ...is a really adorable space. 
Thank you. 
You know, candy is my passion. 
Yeah, I said it. 
Always has been. 
Even as a kid, I would have my G.I. Joes 
sell sweet tarts to my Transformers. 
Gum drops, gummy bears, gummy worms, gummy hot dogs, gummy pizza. 
Ooh, I just had a gummy-gasm. 
So what was your favorite candy as a kid? 
Actually, I didn't eat a lot of candy as a child. 
Okay, I'm gonna overlook that because you're pretty, but maybe we could talk about your terrible childhood over coffee sometime. 
Yeah? 
I'd leave you two alone, if this place wasn't filled with candy. 
Okay, so what's your favorite flavor? 
Coconut. 
And I'm walking to the "C"s. 
The candy's alphabetical? 
 Now I'm marrying you too. 
 Okay. 
Let's see. 
Coconut watermelon slice. 
How's that sound? 
Um, not so good. 
Actually, please don't say anything more about candy. 
Is it hot in here? 
No, it's awesome in here. 
Boston baked beans? 
Didn't know they weren't real beans till I was 20. 
Please stop. 
Is it cold in here? 
Is it hot and cold in here? 
Max, I feel weird. 
Relax, it's just your lady parts waking up from hibernation. 
Again, small store. 
Can hear everything. 
I am so sorry. 
Pardon me. 
Oh, uh, are you okay? 
I'm fine. 
Max, I am not fine. 
I'm gonna be sloppy joanne in about two seconds. 
Tiny, tiny store. 
Do you need to use the No. We're fine. 
We'll just be going. 
Nice to meet you. 
Nope, I'm not gonna make it. 
Where is the Right--right there. 
I'm sure she'll be all right. 
I'm just gonna step outside. 
The sound of someone throwing up makes me Oh, dude, I've been trying to not throw up this whole time. 
Whew, what happened there, right? 
Feeling better? 
Did she tell you she projectile-puked soup and sloppy seconds all over a really cute guy and his floor? 
Let me put it this way, Caroline. 
In my heroin days, that would have been a perfectly acceptable first date. 
I don't understand it. 
We ate the exact same thing. 
How could you have not have gotten sick? 
You must still have "rich girl" stomach. 
I'm used to poor food. 
What made you sick made my skin clear up. 
 Hi, girls. 
 Hey, Sophie. 
I'll be in my booth. 
Oh. 
Well, this is weird. 
It's okay. 
You didn't know. 
Don't let it happen again. 
Okay, good-bye now. 
Sophie, what do you think you're doing? 
What? They were sitting 
in my booth. 
It is not your booth, it's my booth. 
If it was your booth, wouldn't it have a booster seat? 
Oh, Sophie wants to dance? 
We gonna dance. 
Max. Hi. 
It's Andy. 
From the store. 
The guy who let you walk out with a push pop in your pocket. 
That wasn't a push pop, Andy. 
I was happy to see you. 
Well, you're gonna be even happier in a minute. 
Yay! 
But these come with a catch. 
Invites for Caroline and you to a party at my candy store. 
But maybe don't wear that uniform. 
People are gonna think you're a giant sugar daddy. 
So, she's still going at it, huh? 
Such a skinny girl. 
How much more can come out of her? 
Nah, she's just a little embarrassed. 
Something about self-esteem. 
I don't know. 
She throws it around like it means something. 
Well, I'd love her to come. 
No pressure. 
But if you can talk her into it, there'll be unlimited candy for you for the rest of your life. 
Look at him, stealing my bit. 
The candy man came with invitations to a party at his store. 
What, you think I wasn't listening at the door? 
I heard everything. 
All the vomit jokes. 
I heard them all. 
Jewelry, already? 
Your new husband likes to throw the cash around. 
He is not my new husband. 
And now he never will be. 
Ooh, bubble tape. 
I finally meet an adorable, sweet guy. 
A guy so sweet, the word "sweet" is next to his name on actual real estate. 
And I completely destroy any chance I have with him. 
You didn't destroy anything. 
And it's good to let him know right off the bat that you have a gag reflex. 
Oh! 
Oh, that's lovely. 
Happy Valentines' Day. 
I am not going to that party. 
I can never see him again. 
Well, do you mind if I still go? 
Being in a candy store after midnight is on my bucket list. 
Funny, I thought that was the impossible one. 
You should go. 
Have fun. 
I think you're missing out, because you two are perfect for each other. 
You're like Hansel and Gretel. 
They were brother and sister. 
So? 
 So, no Caroline, huh? 
 Uh, no. 
 She couldn't make it. 
 Hmm. 
Well, I'm feeling very sad, but you'll never know it. 
You're fine. 
You don't seem to be short on other female party guests. 
Oh, come on. They're fiends. 
Some of them I know from the neighborhood. 
Some I worked with on Wall Street. 
Wall Street? 
Did you have a little candy tray you walked around with? 
I wish. 
That would have been awesome. 
I was stuck in an office pushing stock in pharmaceutical companies. 
Wait. 
You know people who have access to pills? 
And just when I thought you couldn't get any better. 
Yeah, one day, I went into the firm, and there was no firm. 
Bankrupt. Boom. 
End of job, no money. 
Nothing. 
And after I drank nonstop for a week, I figured, hey, now I can do what I've always dreamed of. 
Open a candy store, be my own boss. 
So I used all my savings and opened up this place. 
And pretty soon, Candy Andy will rule the world of sweets and treats. 
That sound braggy? 
No. 
All right, kick everybody out, and let's go back to my place. 
Ah...Max, no offense, 
but I'm more into your friend. 
Um, Andy, no offense, but I'm more into the candy than the Andy. 
I want you to come to my apartment and say hey to Caroline. 
I was right. 
You two are perfect for each other. 
Yeah? 
I mean, it would be nice to hang with her in pants I don't care about. 
She's not here. 
She must have taken the horse for a walk. 
Wait, you have a horse, and I'm just hearing about this now? 
I have a candy store and it's out of my mouth, in the first 30 seconds. 
Be right back. 
I have to pee. 
She'll be okay with me being here, right? 
Yeah, she was just embarrassed. 
She'll get over it. 
What are you doing? 
Knock first! 
Why are your legs up in the air like that? 
And why were you holding the shower head down by your Oh! 
I'm sorry. 
I thought you'd be home feeling bad for yourself, not feeling your bad self. 
What are you doing home already? 
Why aren't you at the Candy Andy party? 
Oh, don't look at me like that. 
It's not like I'm the only person in the world who masturbates. 
Also, Andy's here. 
We wanted to surprise you. 
But then you surprised us. 
It's not a big deal. 
That kind of situation happens to a lot of people. 
Who? Who has that 
ever happened to? 
I know this might be a delicate area right now, but I'm thinking you should probably pay more than half of our water bill. 
Hey, girls. 
I need some hot tea to warm me up. 
There's no hot water in our building when I tried to take a shower. 
That's because it's all in Caroline. 
Max! 
You are too tense. 
Here. Take this 
and relax a little. 
Eh? 
This doing anything for you? 
Well, I'll be in my booth. 
Hello, Sophie. 
What are you doing in my booth? 
It's not your booth, it's my booth. And look. 
All the other booths are taken. 
So you'll have to sit at small table, as is customary for lone diners. 
This is my booth. 
It's okay, you didn't know. 
Okay, bye-bye now. 
Hello, Max. 
Check out my new booth. 
I think it's better. 
Oh, no. 
I don't want to see him again. 
Look, he's already seen you at your worst. 
You vomited and masturbated. 
That's your full range. 
Hi. 
Look, I know you're really embarrassed about well, everything. 
And there's really nothing I can say to convince you not to be. 
So... 
Who's embarrassed now? 
And to further my embarrassment, I will now do gymnastics in public. 
That is not embarrassing. 
It was amazing. 
All right. 
Well, then come back to my house and watch me masturbate. 
Or we could just get coffee. 
Yay, I'm so happy! 
Thanks, Max. 
No, not for you. 
For me. 
I'm getting unlimited candy and maybe some pills. 
I can't believe you guys are still staring over there. 
Some mothers tend to breast-feed for a lot longer these days. 
It's called detachment parenting. 
When the kid is that big, it's called dating. 
I mean, he's gotta come up for air at some point. 
No, he doesn't. 
Isn't he too old to drink from the teat? 
The kid is my height. 
Don't get any ideas. 
Well, it's happened: I've lived too long. 
I'm ready to order. 
I can't. 
I mean, I respect it all, but I'll throw up. 
I'll go. 
I can't afford HBO, and it's the closest I can get to seeing Game of Thrones. 
Hi, what can I get you? 
He's obviously good drink-wise. 
I'll have tea and a turkey club. 
Anything for him? 
Coffee for the milk? 
Burger? Fries? 
I'll have fries. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh! Late night phone call. 
Ring-a-ding-dang. 
Someone's gonna get their freaky freak on. 
It's my father. 
I don't judge. 
Hey, Daddy. 
Me? I'm fine. 
A little bummed: It's truffle season, and no one I know knows what a truffle is, but... 
Oh! Our estate auction? 
Yeah, I think I heard something about that. 
But honestly, Daddy, I haven't given it a second thought. 
No, you don't have to worry about me. 
I am not at all emotional about it. 
Wha Thank God it's not flip-flop Friday. 
Well, wait, I'll ask her. 
My father wants to know if you'll come out to the prison  and finally meet him. 
 Sure. 
Great. We'll see you 
tomorrow. 
Bye. 
I'm not going. 
What? Why'd you say yes? 
'Cause you never tell a man in prison no. 
He could hang himself with his belt. 
Do not give me that look. 
It happened to me twice already. 
Oh, God, has anything not happened to you twice already? 
Max, come on. 
It's really important to me that you meet my father. 
Well, you never met my father, and you don't see me dragging you to every rail road boxcar in the country trying to find him. 
Come on, it's gonna be a really hard week for me. 
Has any week ever not been hard for you? 
Everything I've ever owned is being auctioned off to the public. 
I'm humiliated. 
Would this be a bad time to tell you your one long face hair is back? 
Well, there's something they can't take away from me, and apparently, I can't either. 
Well, well, here comes the sun, and the moon is looking great too. 
Oh, Earl, your flirting is just the right amount of dirty, and that's not easy. 
Sophie's here. 
Quick, how's my hairnet? 
I'm about to go over and ask her out on a romantic date. 
A date? 
Isn't that a waste of time? 
I mean, you guys already have sex so often, I took a pregnancy test. 
Evening, Sophie. 
As you know, we have now been together for 468 sexual encounters. 
I believe it is time I take you out on a romantic date. 
Aw, I don't know. 
Who has time to go out any more? 
Can't you just come over and ruin my sheets like you usually do? 
Oh, just say yes. 
I'll take you anywhere you want. 
Then take me to the Channing Family auction and buy me something gold. 
How is this romantic? 
How is this romantic? 
It's gold. 
Wait, is that the catalog from Caroline's estate auction? 
Yes. 
I found it in the trash out behind our building. 
Caroline threw it there 'cause she doesn't wanna see it again. 
You better give it to me before she comes out here and lights you on fire. 
She kinda does that now. 
Sophie, let go, seriously. 
No, you're never gonna win, Max. 
You know, when I was born, the doctors tried to pry my dead twin sister from my hands, but I never let go. 
She was my first doll. 
Hey, Sophie, you don't happen to have any tweezers, do you? 
Like, the really good industrial kind? 
Oh, you know about the hair? 
Oh. 
'Cause I was gonna have to take you out for a beer and talk about it. 
Max, what is that thing that you have behind your back? 
What? No, nothing. 
Yes, right here. 
Is that the auction catalog that just fell between your legs? 
No, you're watching an episode of I didn't know I was pregnant. 
What is this thing doing here? 
Isn't it enough I have a 2-foot face hair? 
Nice, Han. 
She's upset again. Happy? 
Sorry, I thought we were playing some kind of hiding game. 
Oh, reach for me like that again and we'll be playing a different game called "guess which part of Han I cut off." 
Yeah, that's right. 
You better walk away. 
Now, can I have my catalog back? 
You brought this in here? 
I can't believe it, Sophie. 
I can't believe you think it's okay for you to just sit here and casually flip through this catalog that contains everything I love from my old life. 
I just think it's really insensitive and stuff. 
I mean, what are you thinking? 
What is wrong with you, I mean, besides your obvious choice of bad fabric and color. 
Oh, no. 
You back up your truck, bearded lady. 
I'm insensitive? 
I'm the thief who stole all those people's money? 
And you don't think this color is happening? 
Pick up a copy of Polish Vogue. 
All right, okay, okay. 
It's all getting a little tense. 
I think we're all clear about what needs to happen right now. 
Plink. 
Wow, this prison's a lot better than the last one. 
It's more like a country club. 
I mean, I think I saw a list for mixed doubles where we signed in. 
Max, I know your idea of a country club's an abandoned car in the woods, but look around. 
There's security cameras and bars on the windows. 
All right, so it's a rough country club, where the strongest golfers make the caddies their bitch. 
Max, my father's in prison. 
Be more sensitive and stuff. 
Look, I get it. 
You're protective. 
He's your father and you love him, but I'm sorry, not everybody feels that way. 
 Daddy. 
 There she is. 
Aww, uhh! 
How's my little girl? 
I'm great, Daddy. 
 Yeah. 
 I like the new uniform, and it isn't at all prison-y. 
Yeah. I don't know 
what's worse: Being locked up or looking like you work at a banana republic. 
Now, wait a minute. 
This can't be Max. 
The stories I've heard, I was expecting more of a truck driver. 
Hey, Brian, you might wanna look the other way. 
I think Max is here to break me out. 
Isn't that right, Max? 
Martin Channing. 
Shall we? 
Okay, fine, your dad is awesome. 
Well, our projected cupcake business growth ratio isn't where I want it to be, but with autumn here, we have a lot of hope in the launch of our new pumpkin spice flavor. 
Honey, I love you very much, but we're almost out of time, and I can't talk any more about cupcakes. 
Just wanted to pick your brain. 
Now, Max, I asked you to meet me here today because I wanna ask you a favor. 
You want me to smuggle something in? 
Something out? 
I'm good either way. 
I want you to take Caroline to the estate auction. 
Daddy, no. 
Why would I put myself through that? 
Why would I ever go where everybody knows who I am and be publicly humiliated? 
I know it will be hard for you, but I promise it'll be worth it. 
There's one thing at that auction that I really care about that I want you to have. 
What? 
The painting of me as a baby? 
The sculpture of me as a five-year-old? 
The tapestry of me at 14? 
I have a pretty good police sketch of me at seven. 
I want you two to go there and get the loving cup you won jumping with Chestnut. 
I know how much that meant to you. 
Even if I could bring myself to go through all that, we need every penny we have for the cupcake business. 
Tell him, Max. 
Martin, you know I'd do anything for you. 
Anything. 
But it's true. 
We're broke. 
 Time is up. 
 Seriously, Daddy, I use the box our soap comes in as a wallet. 
Man, that is hard to hear. 
Max, you're my girl, right? 
Am I? 
I want you to find a way to get that cup. 
No matter what she says, make sure she gets that cup. 
You follow me? 
You want me to follow you? 
Can I even go back there? 
No, you can't, miss. 
Oh, follow you, like follow your thought. 
It's important for her, and it's important for the both of you for your futures, all right? 
Get the cup. 
What are you getting? 
The cup, Martin? 
I love you, sweetheart. 
Love you too, Daddy. 
And don't worry: We'll get that cup. 
I'm not getting that cup. 
What? Then why did you say 
you would? 
You can't tell a man in prison "no." 
He'll hang himself with his belt. 
It happened to you twice already. 
We have to go get that cup. 
Why? 
There's money in the cup. 
What are you talking about? 
He said we needed it for our future, then he winked. 
It was either that, or he was hitting on me, which, I'm not gonna lie, I wouldn't hate. 
How would he even hide money in a cup, Nancy Drew? 
Well, what does a loving cup look like? 
Is it like a bowling trophy? 
How dare you. 
Does it have, like, a wood base? 
Yup, I used to hide my stash in my mother's bowling trophy, and you're telling me the man who invented a way to defraud most of New York isn't as clever as a stoned 12-year-old with a butter knife? 
Well, it was weird how it was all about the cup and so little about the pumpkin spice cupcake. 
Right? 
And you don't think your father who spent a fortune to turn you into a sculpture, presumably nude, wouldn't try to figure out a way to take care of his only daughter? 
The man's a criminal genius, and he found a way to put money for your future in the cup, and clearly, that's why he dragged me out to prison, because he knows you'll do what I say 'cause I'm the boss of you, and pretty soon I'm gonna be your stepmom. 
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I hear what you're saying, but I just have one big question. 
How much are we willing to bid? 
No, about my disguise. 
I know I'm a brunette, but do I have bangs? 
Actually, I need two: One for me, and one for my friend Zooey Deschanel. 
What? You look like her. 
Everybody does. 
It's the least expensive look you can do and still get laid. 
God, this is from storage. 
I haven't seen it in years. 
Wow, you had all these closets, and no one in your family is gay? 
Look! It's the Louie the XVI 
I used to have in my playroom. 
My cousin Peter and I used to climb in here and play French Revolution. 
I'd be Marie Antoinette, and he'd help me put my hair up in a high chignon. 
Oh, now I'm feeling bad for his wife. 
So where do you think the cup is? 
Let's look over there. 
Oh, this is from the summer house. 
Max, you know the expression "born with a silver spoon in your mouth"? 
This is mine. 
Miss, do not handle that. 
I'm asking you to put it down right now. 
Hey, you might wanna relax the attitude. 
You really think my friend Jennifer Love Hewitt, international movie and Lifetime channel superstar, is gonna steal a used spoon? 
Sorry, I didn't recognize you. 
Now I see it. 
I thought I was Zooey Deschanel. 
Eh, six of one. 
All you Hollywood brunettes look alike. 
The auction is starting, ladies and gentlemen. 
Hi, Max. 
I'm so excited to be here. 
Oh, hello, Caroline. 
Sophie, I apologize for the other day. 
I was really tense, and I didn't mean it. 
I think you have a unique sense of style. 
You do so much with so little fabric. 
I do... 
And I see you took my advice and got Polish Vogue. 
How nice is this? 
We are finally on a romantic date. 
We just came from lunch at Rainbow Room, and I'm wearing my best Fila tracksuit. 
Yah, now, he's going to buy me something golden. 
Yah, I want to be covered in gold. 
I want a golden shower. 
Let's see. 
If I was a loving cup, where would I be? 
Some place with a lot of cash shoved up inside you. 
How much do you think is in there? 
Well, let's see. 
The wooden base of the cup is about this big, and I know you can get 20,000 in an Altoids tin, and this is about three times that size, so 60,000. 
$60,000? 
That's like a million dollars! 
So I could have $60,000 in an hour? 
Well, we. 
We could have it. 
Did I say I? 
How weird. 
And sold. 
Wow, you're getting everything. 
Yes, we are. 
Aren't we, Miss Pickle? 
I'm Hamish McDonough, by the way. 
Oh, I'm Max, and this is my friend Katie Holmes. 
We won't speak of it... 
But I just have to say: Well done! 
And if you ever need anything, don't hesitate. 
Oh, you have your own shop? 
"Just The Two Of Us" antiques. 
Is that you and Miss Pickle? 
No, dear, I'm not insane. 
Next item for auction: A 19th century ivory and gold bedside table, Oh! 
Oh, say it again. 
This is highly unorthodox, but I shall repeat the item. 
A 19th century gold and ivory bedside table I'm a very lucky man, yes? 
We start the opening bid on this item at $50,000. 
I'm out. 
 50,000. 
 Here. 
Do I hear 60,000? 
 60,000! 
 60,000 over here. 
Do I hear 70,000? 
70,000. 
Do I hear 80,000? 
Yes, you do! 
80,000 going once, going twice, sold. 
Hamish, you killed it. 
Yolo! 
And the next item up for bid is a silver-plated tin loving cup, property of Caroline Channing. 
How much do you think this is going to go for? 
Kitsch is always a wild card, but it has no real value. 
No real value? Please. 
I won that when no one thought I could. 
I jumped 14 hurdles in the rain with walking pneumonia. 
It's worth something. 
Yeah, 'cause it has money in it. 
We start the bidding at $50. 
50. 
51. 
Sir, it's in increments of $10. 
Then, I'm out. 
Sorry, the Rainbow Room really sucked me dry. 
Hm, guess what else is pretty dry right now? 
Do I hear 60? 
60. 
What are you doing? 
You said it had no real value. 
I know, but wouldn't it be camp to see Miss Pickle taking a bath in that for my Christmas card? 
Do I hear 70? 
My cup is not a puppy bath. 
 70. 
 80. 
Back out now, ladies. 
I'm a paddle bitch. 
Well, I'm a bitch bitch. 
100. 
 125. 
 150. 
 175. 
 Hamish came to play. 
So did we, I broke my hymen getting that thing. 
Is that why it's called a loving cup? 
 200. 
 I have 200. 
Do I hear 225? 
Look, Hamish. 
I know you have no interest in what I would normally offer you to get what I want. 
Don't be so sure. 
I was bisexual till I was 62. 
Look, Katie Holmes really wants this, and she's been through a lot. 
True. It's yours. 
I'm out. 
200 going once, going twice. 
 Sold. 
 Yes, I'm rich! 
Did you just say "I'm"? 
I think you're hearing me wrong. 
Okay, before we use all this money on the business, we should take a vacation. 
How 'bout it? 
You, me, Chestnut, jet skis. 
Okay, here we go. 
No, no, no. 
Don't open it now. 
There are cameras here. 
We can just go over there and open it right next to that thing where you and your little queen cousin played dress-up. 
Seriously, how could I not have known that? 
When we played Cowboys and Indians, he played the Indian's makeup artist. 
I have to say, Max, it'll be nice to have some money again, but what's really nice is that now you see who my father is, a man who, despite all of his flaws, never stopped thinking about what he could do to take care of his little girl. 
It's empty? 
Son of a bitch. 
Martin, we just have one question. 
Where's the money? 
I'm sorry, what? 
Where's...The money? 
What? 
She's asking where the money is. 
Oh! Uh, what money? 
The money in the cup, Daddy. 
The money you hid in the cup that was supposed to be for my future? 
Where's my 60 grand? 
Which, for anyone who might be watching my lips, we were going to give all to charity. 
Sweetheart, why do you think I would hide money, besides the fact I'm here for hiding money? 
Well, that might have been my fault. 
No, it's not her fault, Daddy. 
It's yours. 
You were supposed to take care of me, and you didn't. 
You didn't think about me at all, and it's not just me. 
You hurt a lot of people. 
Do you ever even think about them? 
Yes, I do. 
Now, every day, but I also think about what I did to you every day, all day. 
I mean, back then, when I figured out a way to get free money, all I could think  about was the money. 
 I hear that. 
But I really did wanna give you something for your future, sweetheart, which is why I asked Max to make sure that you got that cup. 
And I know it's only tin, but it's the most valuable thing I could give you, because it'll remind you that no matter how hard the circumstances, you could get over any hurdle, even the ones I put in front of you. 
Okay, well, we should go. 
Our time's up. 
Yeah, but--what? 
You just got here. 
Well, I think I'm done for today. 
Boy, I've dreaded the day you looked at me like this. 
Now that it's here, it's even worse. 
I only hope that one day you could look at me again the way you did the day you won that cup. 
I love you, honey. 
I love you too, Daddy. 
Oh. 
Sorry. 
You meant her. 
See you next week? 
Wow, having a father is rough. 
 Are you okay? 
 I will be, because despite what everyone else may think, he's not just a thief. 
He's my father, and I love him. 
Look, if it's any consolation, I now see how that could've happened to him. 
I'm not condoning it, but I see how people can get caught up, 'cause I am pissed as hell that next week I won't be riding a horse who's riding a jet ski. 
﻿1 Hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick. 
I want to look in the mirror and make sure I'm still dead in the eyes. 
You think you can handle my section? 
Uh, yeah, I think I can handle it. 
Hey, Earl, I don't know if you noticed, but I'm running the whole diner right now. 
What, what? 
The customer at table ten appears to be choking, and I would help, but the last time I gave a white woman the heimlich, I did six months in the Birmingham city jail. 
Oh, my God, are you choking? 
Oh, my God, I feel like you're choking! 
Is anyone here a doctor? 
What am I saying? 
I forgot where I am. 
Has anyone here ever seen Scrubs? 
What do you do when a girl is choking? 
I just back up a few inches. 
What do we do? 
What do we do? 
This woman is choking! 
Thank you so much. 
You're welcome. 
And feel free to tip me what you think your life's worth. 
I feel 3 bucks coming my way. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Here you go, guys. 
I'm the only waitress. 
Sorry you waited longer for the burger than you did for that Cosby sweater to come back. 
Max, look at my face. 
I'm very upset. 
Oh. 
Is that what that means? I just 
assumed you were constipated. 
Caroline is late again. 
And she better not use your new cupcake shop as an excuse this time, 'cause sister, that crap ain't gonna fly. 
First of all, stop talking like you're in a Tyler Perry movie. 
And secondly, Caroline's here; She's in the kitchen. 
Oh, really? 
'Cause when I was in there, you told me she was out here. 
You play me, fool. 
Stop talking like you're in a Tyler Perry sequel. 
And secondly I'll ask Earl. 
Earl... 
 Oop! 
 Ow! 
What happened? 
Why did you scream? 
I accidentally sat on one of my boys! 
Have you seen Caroline tonight? 
Of course I have, man. 
I just saw her go down the hall to the ladies room. 
There. Happy? 
You've solved the big mystery, Shortlock Holmes. 
Wait, she didn't pick up any of her Caroline? 
Can't talk now, Han. 
And how many more times do I have to ask you to fix this damn pie carousel? 
I mean, the temp just isn't cool enough, and those tapiocas are gonna turn bad. 
If you do want a lawsuit, just keep ignoring me. 
Max, can I see you in the kitchen where I was just a couple minutes ago after I got out of the ladies room? 
Yeah, get on that temperature thing. 
There's so much mold growing in there that cherry pie's gonna need a pap smear. 
That was some ballsy, bold, in-your-face awesome lying. 
I learned it by watching you, Dad. 
Had to lie. 
We need every minute we can steal away from here to get the cupcake shop ready. 
We still have to do the second coat of paint, figure out tables and chairs... 
What? 
Didn't have time for lunch. 
Oh, I don't care. 
I'm surprised you're using a spoon. 
I just stick my face in it. 
So, my brilliant idea of how we get this all done is we should get an intern to help. 
What? No. 
I can't be a person that has an intern. 
I can barely be a person that doesn't have an intern. 
Max, all businesses use interns. 
We just have to post an ad online at NYU or Columbia, and we'll have 20 applicants battling it out to do our grunt work for credit. 
You make it sound like The Hunger Games: College Edition. 
Sorry, I'm against getting people to work for free. 
I'm with you, Max. 
My people were interns for 436 years. 
I am just getting used to the idea of having my own business and now you want me to be someone's boss? 
I am not the boss. 
I'm the person who talks behind the boss's back. 
Pick up. 
Thanks. 
Isn't Han a tool? 
 Total tool. 
 Yeah, a tiny tool. 
Like the kind you fix your eyeglasses with. 
See? 
That's my wheelhouse. 
Look, I don't want to ask someone to work for free. 
We can do it all ourselves. 
You want to do it all yourself? Great. 
I'll write everything you need to do on a to-do list. 
Why don't you to-do that? 
And I will to-tear it up. 
What're we tearing up? 
'Cause if it's that ass, I already got that covered. 
Hi, Andy. 
That's so sweet and dirty. 
Easy, easy. What are you, 
shipping off to war? 
Here. Take this giant bag of 
skittles and look the other way. 
I'm not that easy. 
Ooh, new mystery flavors? 
We getting together after you get off work? 
It'll be really late. 
Max and I still have to go to the cupcake shop and tape up the windows so we can start the trim tomorrow. 
Okay, I'm not very good at painting, but I can do this while you paint. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, roll that paint on that wall. 
Oh... 
You are so freaking cute. 
Ugh, white people. 
Look, why don't you guys just get an intern? 
That's what I did when I opened my shop. 
You two are like evil warlords mining the souls of innocent zombies. 
Oh, and keep your eyes peeled at your store. 
The janitor told me he saw some rat droppings. 
But all you gotta do is set up some traps. 
Oh, gross. 
Who's gonna do that? 
The intern? 
So, Ruth, you are a sophomore at NYU, majoring in finance? 
You know you're not gonna get paid. 
No money at all. 
Yup, it's in internship. 
I mean, it's all good, right? 
It's all good until you need money. 
Well, we're a startup company, and we're launching our very first retail store, so there's a lot of details that you'll be responsible for. 
There's a lot of carrying things, maybe some trapping things. 
Oh, it's cool. 
I have a car. 
You have a car and you want to be an intern? 
How 'bout if we switch places? 
I'll be the intern with the car, and you can sit on a broken folding chair next to Donna Trump over here. 
Well, Max and I need to have a little meeting right now, so if you could go over to the waiting room, that'd be great. 
Okay, Ruth? 
I just wanna say I know my name is weird, but like it's too late, right? 
Max, why are you trying to convince her to not be our intern? 
Why are you not saying, "You may get rabies and bubonic plague from our rats?" 
Don't mention the rats. 
You're chasing them away. 
And we do not have rats. 
We have rat droppings. 
Let's not jump to conclusions. 
You're right, the rats are probably just coming in here to use the bathroom. 
Look, we need an intern. 
Now, who do you like so far? 
The one with the big boobs. 
I knew it. All you big boob 
people stick together. 
Hi, girls. 
Are you having a beauty contest and didn't invite me to give the other girls a chance? 
We're interviewing people to be our intern. 
Who doesn't get paid. 
Well, this is for you. 
You didn't have to do that. 
You already gave us the money for the shop. 
I know, I'm too wonderful. 
But it's for good luck, and sounds like you're gonna need it. 
Oleg says that it's rat central station around here. 
Not rats, Sophie, just rat droppings. 
Oh, just rat droppings. 
Oh, okay, no problem there. 
Are you out of breath because you jogged here all the way from 1974? 
Sexy, huh? 
You should see his badunkadunk when he jogs. 
Well, here they are. 
60 rat traps. 
Girls... 
I don't want to interfere with your business, but what the hell is goin' on here? 
There's no fancy tables or pretty chairs. 
I mean, this place is so unappealing, even I don't look good here. 
No worries. 
We have some adorable old-school ice cream tables and chairs on hold at a kooky, fun Staten Island junkyard. 
Wow. 
I can't believe you didn't just shoot a blood clot trying to make dump furniture sound cute. 
Okay, girls, well, call me when you have a real business. 
Yeah, and I'm I'm gonna take this, you know, so that the rats don't poop in it. 
Come on, badunkadunk. 
Oh, and, uh, Max... 
Oh, she's good. Yes. 
I knew it. All you big boob 
people stick together. 
Well? 
Here we are. 
The final three. 
Well, you know the one I like. 
I'll give you a clue. 
One, two. 
Standing in front of me I see two beautiful, qualified young women. 
Is she really going all Top Model right now? 
If only. They pay. 
I'm out, Tyra. 
Ruth, congratulations. 
You've been selected to be our intern. 
Max, will you get Ruth started on something? 
Yup, I got the internship. 
Um... 
You know what? 
I got it. 
It's not like you're getting paid. 
Big boob people are so much easier. 
As a kid, people told you everything you did was amazing, didn't they? 
I was given a lot of positive reinforcement. 
I think it gave me the confidence that's gotten me through this last year. 
Well, it's time you heard the truth. 
You stink at stuff. 
Like painting. 
Fine. 
And you stink at stuff too. 
Like telling an intern what to do. 
Ruth had to go to that concert. 
She had the tickets for weeks. 
It was Ashley D and Ashley B's joint birthday. Duh. 
And so the intern's out having fun, and here we are, the bosses, painting the walls at 3:00 a.m. 
Well, I'm painting. 
You got a kind of autistic ballerina thing going on over there. 
Can I ask you something? 
I don't like Maroon 5. 
No matter how many times you ask, the answer will always be no. 
Not that. 
Would it be okay if I told Andy not to come over tonight 'cause I'm so exhausted, or is it a little too early in the relationship to be all, "I don't think I can have my legs up around my ears tonight"? 
It's fine. 
You don't think he'd enjoy a night off from constant Maroon 5 badgering? He would. 
Feels awkward. Can't. 
My legs can go up there. 
They're fine. 
I don't want to have that conversation right now. 
Hey, look, I get it. 
There are conversations you don't want to have. 
Like, "hey, Ruth, here's $0. 
Put down some rat traps." 
We have a box right here that's not touched. 
Look, we're not talking about your relationship anymore. 
We're done. 
Relax. It's probably not even 
a rat, it's probably a mouse. 
Not a big deal. 
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, 
I see it! There it is! 
 The mouse? 
 That is not a mouse! 
That is a car that a mouse drives! 
Where did you see it? 
It was in the middle, right? 
 Shh! 
 Why are you whispering? 
I don't want him to hear me. 
How do you know it's a he? 
He looked at me kind of rapey. 
There! 
He just ran behind the thing! 
 What thing? 
 That thing! 
This thing? Waah! 
What? Did you see it? 
I don't think so. 
Oh, you'd know so. 
It has a saddle. 
Oh, my God. 
He just opened the door with the strength of his whiskers. 
He's gone. 
He went into the kitchen. 
Oh, what should we do? 
Should we call the cops? 
He doesn't have a gun. 
Let's just get out of here. 
We'll call an exterminator in the morning. 
Too late, he's coming back! 
 Aah! He's charging us! 
 He's gonna bite me! 
Waah! 
You can stop now! 
You painted him to death. 
I just got a glimpse of you at a Barneys sample sale. 
What a mess. 
Who's gonna clean that up? 
The intern? 
Oh, Andy... 
I know. 
I'm good at this. 
What? 
Is there another rat? 
What are you doing? 
I forgot Andy was here! 
And your sex voice is the same as your murder voice. 
So are you just gonna stand there? 
Are you offering me a three-way? 
Well, it looks like we're about to be a full-blown orgy. 
It's 2:00 a.m. 
Who could this be? 
It's Ruth. 
 Ruth? 
 Yes. I'm late, right? 
Why is she here? 
I texted her and said you needed an enema. 
Okay, now, this is some industrial-strength girl talk. 
I had to do something to show her who was boss. 
I learned it while interning at Condé Nast. 
We've all gotten someone an enema in the middle of the night, it's a rite of passage. 
For someone to get their passage right? 
Beat me to it. 
There. Go open the door. 
You know what has to happen. 
Max has to put Ruth in her place so she can learn how to be a boss. 
Oh. That's all? Good. 
'Cause I thought from your tone you were gonna force Max to have an enema. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I had the tiniest pot cookie and had to pull over to take a nap. 
Anyway, here is your enema. 
Enjoy. 
They only had the triple pack. 
Wait, Ruth? 
Max has something she wants to say to you. 
Max, what did you want to say to Ruth? 
Um, thanks for the triple? 
Three times the fun. 
You sure you don't want me to help you with that? 
Oh, no, it's okay. 
You took the rat traps out of the box, you need a break. 
Plus, we couldn't afford the game Mouse Trap when I was a kid, and this is the closest I'm gonna get. 
So, when do you make the cupcakes? 
Um... 
I guess I could make them now. 
Fun. 
I'll go get the coffees, right? 
Sure, of course. 
Do whatever. 
You got a life. 
Who am I to tell you what to do? 
Well, here's our Martha Stewart blurb, all blown up and ready to roll out and paste up on that wall. 
 Where's Ruth? 
 She's in the kitchen. 
 I was just in there. 
 Then she's in the bathroom. 
Oh, my God, you're Haning me! 
She took a coffee break. 
What? She didn't need a break. 
She just started 20 minutes ago. 
Your rich is really coming out, and it is not pretty. 
Forgot my phone. 
I mean, get it together, Ruth, right? 
Watch and learn. 
Ruth, can you put the rat traps down, one in each corner, and then you can get coffee later after interning. 
Thanks. 
She's kind of a tool, right? 
Max, were you saying something? 
Nope. 
Ouch! 
Right? 
Oh, look at this cage. 
I think my mom used to dance in it. 
Here they are. 
These are the ones I had the guy hold for us. 
Only $600 for all of them. 
What do ya think, Daddy? 
I like 'em, doll. 
Wrap 'em up. 
And can Daddy get something he wants? 
So cute. 
Over the counter? 
And that way when I'm hungover and taking a nap, people can still find the cupcakes. 
We could have Ruth clean it and then paint and reupholster these. 
By the way, where is she? 
She was supposed to be here an hour ago. 
Text her and find out where she is. 
Why are you so interested in where she is, what she's doing? 
Are you obsessed with her? 
Max, I don't want to make a purse out of her skin. 
I just want her to do her job. 
Never mind. 
I'll just text her. 
Well, be careful. 
Don't delete any of my penis with a hat pictures. 
Even if I did, it's not a big deal. 
Oleg will always pose again. 
Yeah, but I'll never get that little pilgrim hat back. 
"Where are you? 
We needed you here yesterday." 
All in caps, 'cause bosses talk in caps. 
Total tool. 
Look at that. 
Texted right back, 'cause I'm the boss. 
She says... 
Yesterday was super hard so she's not feeling great and she can't come in today? 
That's it. She's fired. 
Here. 
You have to fire her. 
She said she was sick, Condé Nasty. 
She's not sick, she's just taking advantage 'cause you're too friendly with her. 
She works for us. 
Yeah, for free. 
Why don't you just hollow her out and live inside of her, you monster? 
Um, I don't think we were supposed to get this. 
"The dumb one wants me to pick up all this crappy furniture. 
"Right? As if. 
I'll be at the bar in ten. 
Order me a Bellini." 
Oh, who's the monster now? 
She just called you the dumb one. 
Uh, she called you the dumb one. 
It's your phone, you're the dumb one. 
She knows I don't talk in caps, so that's to you. 
You're the dumb one. 
 Fire her. 
 No, you fire her. 
No, you fire her. 
No, you hired her, you fire her. 
I wanted to go with Molly big boobs. 
She'd be here right now with four chairs on each boob. 
Why can't you just fire her? 
It's clear she called you the dumb one. 
All right, fine, I know she called me the dumb one. 
But I can't fire her. 
I want to, but there is a block. 
Right here. 
It comes up, and then goes, "nope!" It goes right back down. 
I am not supposed to fire someone. 
I am the someone who's supposed to be fired. 
So I guess I'm the boss, then. 
Sounds like a plan. 
I'll be in my mom's cage. 
All right, come on, you lowly worker. 
Help the boss pull these chairs out. 
Don't yell at me, boss. 
I'm blocked. 
Wish you had your enemas now, don't you? 
They followed us! 
We walked into a trap! 
It's a vendetta! 
Ugh, I can't believe this! 
Our intern's out having cocktails and I'm trapped on top of rat mountain! 
He's coming after me! 
Whoa--whoa! 
Oh, my God! 
Max! Help! 
No, you bastards! 
Get off her! 
Aah! 
Get off! 
My foot's caught under this thing! 
Aah! 
Max, that was amazing. 
You just lifted that giant thing up with one hand. 
I know. 
And now I'm gonna fire that bitch! 
Wow. You suck at this too. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I was having a dream that I was sleeping in, then I woke up, and I was. 
Who's the boss? 
Tony Danza? 
No, Max, who's the boss? 
I am. 
Have a seat, Ruth. 
Here? 
Good call. 
In addition to being a boss, I am also a waitress. 
But when I do my job, I don't call people dumb. 
All right, I do, but at least it's to their face. 
Oh, you're talking about that thing? 
I meant Caroline. 
No, I know you meant me, because I'm not dumb and neither is Caroline. 
And one thing I figured out is that in business, maybe I have to be a little more ruthless. 
Meaning no more Ruth. 
You're fired. 
So, I'm not getting college credit? 
I'll probably get kicked out of school again, but no worries, right? 
I'm really proud of how you stuck up for yourself. 
You're fired. 
Sorry, I can't stop. 
Look, Max. 
We're on our way. 
﻿1 Mm! 
I like the lemon. 
So good. 
And with the vanilla frosting, it would make a lovely cupcake wedding cake. 
Mm. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God! 
The chocolate! 
You do realize you're not alone, right? 
I know. 
I'm gonna get some water, and then I'll be back to taste everything! 
There's no wedding. 
 What? 
 It's a scam. 
I know her game. 
There isn't a Denny's on the Eastern Seaboard I haven't hit up and said it's my birthday for a free sundae. 
Well, what if you're wrong, and she is the real deal? 
A cupcake wedding cake could be a lot of money. 
We have to crack her B.S. 
Before she eats our cupcakes, and then us. 
Follow my lead. 
Oh! What are we tasting now? 
Coconut. 
 What's your fiance's name? 
 Doug Franklin. 
 Where'd you meet? 
 He's a fireman. 
 He rescued my cat. 
 Aw. 
No "aw." 
That's an insurance commercial. 
 So where's the wedding? 
 Barefoot on the beach. 
That's a tampon commercial. 
Ooh! Hi, baby! 
Max, you're wrong. 
They're kissing. 
Nope, he's either an out-of-work actor she hired, or he has cake in his mouth. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  I have an announcement to make. 
You found your first "down there" hair? 
No, it's the last chance to put in your business card to win a luxury weekend vacation. 
It's Han's big promo. 
Well, he's finally announced it. 
Han's a big promo. 
Well, he's a little promo. 
Good luck, you now have a chance to win a fancy two-room suite in the country, and there's a fireplace because Daddy don't skimp. 
Aw, I miss our fireplace in the country. 
My father and I would sit together, and I'd roast marshmallows, and then he'd burn what I now realize must've been incriminating documents. 
Hi, everybody! 
The raffle girl is here. 
Oh, I get to pull the winner! 
She pulled me twice today, and I won both times. 
Sophie, the way you look tonight, we are all winners. 
Oh, Earl, that is so sweet. 
I would kiss you if it was legal. 
All right, I'm going to put in one of my cleaning company cards. 
All right. 
Who's gonna be the winner? 
Yeah, yeah, shake it like a Polaroid picture, baby. 
Yeah. 
Oh. 
Oh, no, that doesn't feel like my card. 
Sophie, that's cheating. 
Hey, keep out of it, Glinda the good bitch. 
And the winner is... 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes? 
Oh, my God! 
We won! 
Congratulations! 
I've never won anything in my life! 
Except for that time I got stoned and accidentally won that hot dog eating contest. 
Wait, how did this even happen? 
Did you put our card in? 
Actually, I put your card in, and I took a few out. 
I figured you girls could use a vacation. 
You girls been working harder than my liver on payday. 
Oh, Earl, you're like Santa without the weird fixation on children. 
It was so nice of Earl to enter us. 
Oh, stop. 
He's like my father. 
Wow, this place actually looks nice. 
Ooh, an outhouse! 
 Max, that's a sauna. 
 Oh. 
Either way, I'm peeing in it. 
But Max, can we leave the shop? 
I mean, even though business has been slow, what if Dottie wants to come back and order cupcakes for her wedding? 
First off, she ate them all. 
Second, there is no wedding. 
She's a B.S. Bride. 
I guarantee you, right now, she's crawling through an air-conditioning vent at a Krispy Kreme. 
Andy in the house! 
Sorry, I was watching a Living Single marathon before I came over. 
You are not gonna believe this. 
We won a weekend getaway. 
Isn't that exciting? 
We really needed this. 
That's great! 
We do need this. 
Thanks, babe. 
And I was hoping to get a little special one-on-one time with you this weekend. 
So when do we leave? 
Oh, we! 
We can leave tomorrow. 
We--we--we all the way there. 
Look, Han said it was a two-room suite. 
Andy can come with us. 
It's still our trip. 
He doesn't have to know he's the third wheel. 
Well, you know I'm always a fan of lying, so I'm in. 
It's still our trip. 
She doesn't have to know she's the third wheel. 
Well, you know I'm not a fan of lying, but okay, I'm in. 
I love a road trip. 
My mom and I took one in third grade for, like, a year, but we'd just drive around locally and Oh, my God, I lived in a car. 
Hey, let's play a card game. 
I spy something red. 
Is it that gas station? 
Nope. 
 Is it that truck? 
 Nope. 
Is it boring? Yes! 
My turn. 
I spy something annoying. 
 Is it me? 
 Yes! 
I knew the joke was on me, but I love to win. 
You are not annoying. 
You're adorable. 
I spy a big man-gina. 
 Is it me? 
 Yes! 
I like to win too. 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
Hello? 
Bad cell area. 
Max, I think that might've been Dottie, the B.S. Bride. 
I couldn't hear the words, but she sounded unnaturally confident. 
Maybe the B.S. 
stands for "big sale." 
No more business calls, okay? 
I thought we were getting away for fun. 
We are, but our business is nowhere near where we need it to be, and when it comes to ignoring a call, it's kind of hard. 
Hey, you know what this area of the mountains is known for? 
Wineries and incest? 
Alien abductions! 
I know all about it. 
People disappear from here all the time. 
Max, there's no such thing as an extraterrestrial. 
Okay, first, that's something an extraterrestrial would say. 
I've always wanted to be abducted. 
And my guidance counselor said I had no goals. 
And here we go. 
Again, I don't believe in names, but feel free to call me "Roger" if it helps you. 
Get out! 
Get out! 
The bed floats! 
This is awesome! 
Usually, you gotta bring the ropes to the bed. 
This way, you get to eliminate a whole step! 
The bed's sculptural beauty is actually surpassed by the joy of resting in it. 
Some say it's like being rocked to sleep in the arms of God. 
It's a sex bed, Roger. 
May I light the fire for you? 
Oh, no, thanks. 
I can do it. 
I was an Eagle Scout. 
Man, there's just not enough occasions where I can brag about that. 
The room is cute, but really tiny. 
We're gonna need a bigger space, unless we're Hobbits. 
Is this the door to the adjoining room? 
Well, that is an adjoining room, but it's not included in your package. 
Oh, damn it! 
We should've known Han's package was gonna be smaller than he said it is. 
I'm sorry. 
All the other cabins are booked. 
I'll bring you some bedding for the couch at an additional price. 
Ohm Shanti. 
Well, I guess you guys are the couple, so I'll sleep on the couch. 
I can sleep anywhere. 
First two years of my life, my bed was a pile of unopened mail. 
A big, roaring fire is gonna be so romantic. 
Come over here closer to me, you big Eagle Scout. 
Well, now you sound like my Scoutmaster. 
Hey, don't start anything you can't finish in a minute. 
Max'll be right out. 
Something tells me she's not a consistent hand-washer. 
You do your thing. 
I'm just gonna sit right here, and watch my man build a fire. 
Oh, great, this is cedar! 
It's gonna smell so awesome. 
I love falling asleep to the sound of a fire. 
Oh, my God. 
I know, no business stuff, but I just got a text about a big order. 
That's fine, just remember this weekend Oh, I know, me and you. 
Me and you, me and you Max! Max. 
Turns out the B.S. Bride 
isn't B.S. 
She wants pricing on a wedding cupcake cake, and a groom's cupcake cake, for 300 guests. 
Great! 
Almost as great as these little fuzzy shoes! 
They were in a sealed plastic package. 
I'm the first one to ever open them. 
They're like condoms for your feet! 
 New shoes, new shoes  Where are you going? 
To the sauna. 
Hopefully, I'll be abducted on my way, but know that even though I'm gone, I'm happier up there with my alien lover. 
True, they don't have lips, but they do have crazy-long fingers. 
I'll go with you. 
Not to talk about work, but she can't go alone. 
There might be bears. 
There were always bears at my chalet in Aspen, in the woods, lying on the floors, everywhere. 
You know, until PETA attacked the house. 
So this is a fancy sauna? 
Not impressed. 
People pay for the privilege of sitting in decades of ass sweat? 
How come your towel's staying up so much better than mine? 
I can think of two reasons. 
I'm gonna get some water, and then start peeing. 
When you come back, we have to discuss the B.S. Bride's cake. 
We can't screw this up. 
It's all we have. 
This heat is amazing. 
Mother of God! 
That's hot. 
There are bears out there. 
 They're coming this way. 
 What? 
Max, get in here! 
Close the door! 
Fine, but they'll just open it and come in. 
Bears can't open doors and walk in. 
These ones can. 
Hey, girls. 
You mind if we join you? 
You guys are gay bears, right? 
 Max! 
 It's cool. 
My prom date is big in the bear scene now, but in high school, they just called him a jock who cried sometimes. 
Yep, we're bears. 
Big, hairy, not scary. 
I'm Deke. 
This is Dirk. 
Yup, we're Deke and Dirk. 
Pause for reaction. 
I'm Caroline, and this is Max. 
Are you girls lipstick lesbians? 
No, we're just friends, and we can't afford lipstick. 
Especially at this gift shop. 
Have you seen the prices? 
$25 for chap stick? 
Please. 
No one's lips are that chapped. 
And he would know. 
This one's the king of face creaming. 
A little bit dirtier than what it is. 
I'm actually a dermatologist. 
Oh, my God. 
Do not tell me I'm lucky enough to be in a sauna with two dermatologists. 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
I'm an astrophysicist. 
Oh, smarter than the average bear. 
 Loving her. 
 Mmhmm. 
So you know about space stuff, smarty bear. 
Do you believe in aliens? 
Oh, I do, and I believe they're living among us. 
I'm looking at you, Christina Ricci! 
So talk to me, Deke. 
What can you give me? 
He has plenty of free cream samples back in our room. 
And it's the good stuff. 
You should come by! 
We're in cabin four. 
No way! 
We're in cabin three. 
Ah! 
How about those rope beds? 
You know it's kinky when the bed is already tied up. 
First, we were all "um, we're gonna fall," but then we thought, "what the hell? 
It's our man-iversary." 
Aw, you're married? 
Happy anniversary. 
Now, let's get back to those free creams. 
Oh, and here's our card if you're ever in the neighborhood or need a big order. 
You brought a business card to a sauna? 
I don't wanna know where you kept that. 
 Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
 Mm. 
Or in your case, cub-cakes. 
 Loving her. 
 Living for her. 
Wanna come back as her. 
There you go, your dinner for two. 
Two soups, two salads, two entrees, two desserts. 
I hope you three enjoy. 
Maybe could we order another meal? 
No problem, just call. 
Extra charge, of course. 
Ohm Shanti. 
Ohm Shanti means "screw you" in yoga, right? 
I am so starving. 
Oh, my God, this looks amazing! 
Oh, and the bread is still warm! 
And there's one of those crazy-ass pretzel rolls. 
Is it a pretzel? 
Is it a roll? 
No idea, it's crazy. 
Max, put some of this butter on it. 
Try and stop me, bitch! 
Here, take half. 
Thanks! 
Mm. 
Yo. 
Oh, my God, Andy! 
I totally forgot. 
Not about you. 
I forgot my manners. 
If my Danish governess were here, she would hit me with her wooden spoon. 
I'm so sorry. 
Go, sit. 
You eat. 
Enjoy the pretzel roll. 
It's gone. 
You snooze, you lose. 
No, you sit. 
I'm good. 
I'll order more food. 
No, sit! 
Sit. 
I'm the bad one. 
This soup is "duh-mazing." 
Just a word I made up for when something's so amazing, you're stunned, and all you can say is "duh." 
Duh-mazing. 
Yes, I'd like to order anoth Yes, I'll hold. 
I think the hold music is just Roger singing. 
Okay, hang up the phone. 
Go sit and eat. 
Come on. 
Hurry before Max eats the table. 
No, you eat. 
After all, it's our special weekend. 
I want you to enjoy it. 
Well, okay, but only because it's a special occasion. 
Good! 
I'm gonna go take a hot shower. 
Besides, it's always better to make love on an empty stomach. 
That must be why there are so many people in India. 
Max, I got a favor to ask you. 
Do you think you can go visit your bear friends next door, maybe give us some private time? 
It'll be your birthday gift to me. 
Oh! 
It would be my birthday gift to you because it's your birthday. 
Yeah, just for, like, two hours. 
Okay, one hour. 
I'll skip the foreplay, and that'll be my birthday gift to myself. 
Cool, then I'll just go do that, then. 
I mean, Caroline went to all this trouble to get you a trip for your birthday, I assume. 
I know, and I was really looking forward to some birthday sex since we haven't really connected that way since the shop started giving you guys so much trouble. 
But the shop's been in trouble for weeks. 
Yeah, so maybe I'll only need, like, a half hour with her. 
I need my book. 
I'm gonna take a bath instead. 
That tub is so amazing. 
I'm just gonna soak in it and blissfully forget all my problems. 
As well as some other things. 
Max is gonna go visit Yogi and Boo Boo next door and give us some private time. 
She can't do that. 
It's their man-iversary. 
They need their private time. 
Yes, but you guys are celebrating a special thing, too. 
What? 
What are we celebrating? 
Andy's birthday. 
Oh, damn it! 
Now, I went and spoiled all the special sexual things you had planned for him. 
Damn it, Max! 
Now, you did give it all away. 
We were gonna do missionary, and... 
...the other one. 
Okay. 
Okay, I'm sorry. 
I forgot. 
I don't know how. 
I knew today was your birthday. 
It's tomorrow. 
So yippee! 
She hasn't missed it. 
All's right with the world. 
I'm gonna go visit the berenstains. 
This weekend wasn't about my birthday, was it? 
Come on, come on. 
Get your hand out of his honeypot and get over here. 
I'll be gone in a second, and then you guys can jump-start your sex life again. 
What do you mean "jump-start"? 
How could you tell Max that we haven't had sex? 
You haven't even discussed that with me. 
Come on, aliens. 
If you're ever going to abduct me, this would be the time. 
Don't take the attention off the fact that you forgot my birthday. 
Oh, God, I wish I was a cartoon, so I could run right through this door, and leave behind a body-shaped hole. 
 Oh, hey, Max. 
 Hey. 
Mind if I hibernate for a minute? 
Oh, sure, come on in. 
We were just gonna eat and then dye our chest hair. 
Close that damn door now. 
Thanks, it was just getting a little tense in there. 
 She forgot his birthday. 
 Mm, ouch. 
Well, he forgot mine once, and now it's his ankle tattoo. 
Max, please, I insist. 
You don't have to ask me twice. 
You gonna eat the pretzel roll? 
Andy, I'm sorry about your birthday. 
It just went out of my head. 
I feel bad. 
And I feel sick. 
Can you stop swinging the bed? 
Sorry, I'm nervous. 
Yeah, you're nervous a lot, which is why our other bed isn't moving at all. 
No, no, no, no, no, don't go. 
Come back. 
Come back to the sex bed. 
Let's get some sex going! 
Come on! We can 
get this bed moving now! 
See! 
See? 
Hey! Oh, hi! 
Oh, it's your birthday! 
It's your birthday! 
It's tomorrow. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
I can do better, see? 
Here we go! 
Now, here we go! 
Wanna see me twerk it? 
Oh! 
Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
If I'd had any food, I would throw up. 
Okay, yeah, have a seat. 
Let's have some bread. 
Has it really been that long since we had sex? 
Sweetie, after that dance, it's hard to believe you've ever had sex. 
It hasn't been that long. 
The shop opened on the 12th, so it's... 
What? 
No, it's just interesting you had no problem remembering that date. 
Let me ask you a question. 
Where do you think you're going? 
What do you mean? 
I'm here. 
No. 
Where do you think you're going? 
Like, where do you see your life in a year? 
Well, pretty soon, Max and I will be out of this rough patch, and full force with the business, doing weddings and big events, and then Max and I will probably open another store, get a bigger apartment. 
Okay, and am I in there somewhere? 
Oh, come on. 
I was getting to you. 
Were you? 
When? When were you 
getting to me? 
After your business is a success? 
No! Now. 
Come on. 
Sex time in the sex bed. 
Wanna do it on the floor? 
This is so comfortable! 
You put a belt on this, you could wear it out. 
Just don't try that at your in-laws' house with a matching turban. 
Dirk, my father worked 40 years in the factory before he lost his arm. 
 He doesn't get "camp." 
 Okay. 
Now get up here, lady. 
We're having cookies and milk. 
You guys rock. 
I promise I won't stay here all night. 
Don't wanna get trapped in the middle of your country bear jamboree. 
Please, honey. 
You are perfectly safe in this bed. 
We haven't had sex in a year. 
Why would you tell her that? 
Well, she told us about her friends not having sex. 
I thought it was on the table. 
But we haven't even discussed that. 
Mother ship, make it happen! 
This is the time to abduct me. 
Hi. Max, you can come back. 
Andy left. 
He said he'd find his own way home. 
 He left? 
 Because you're not having sex? 
Max, you told the bears we're not having sex? 
Why would you share that? 
Exactly, Caroline. 
And why would you tell Max that, when you never even brought it up in our Gestalt therapy? 
I was planning on addressing it with you this weekend. 
You think I'd spend $500 on this room for milk and cookies? 
I think we're all forgetting how good that soup was. 
Well, I'm sorry if I haven't been feeling very attractive lately. 
I tell you how handsome you are every day. 
Don't you guys look exactly alike? 
Are you okay? 
I'm all right. 
You wanna get in bed and cuddle for a little while? 
No, it's yeah. 
Come on. 
Yeah, get in here. 
There you go. 
There you go. 
Whoo! 
Oh, good. 
You're alive. 
When I heard you left and walked through the woods, I wondered, "was there anal probing?" 
By an alien, not a grifter. 
You texted you wanted to see me? 
Well, someone did. 
Happy Birthday! 
Now, come on, blow. 
I don't really feel like doing that. 
Welcome to our world. 
Andy, I'm so sorry about everything. 
It's okay. 
I had a lot of time to think on the bus, and the other bus, and the bus I had to take when that bus broke down. 
If it makes you feel any better, I have rope burns all down my back. 
Andy, I'm sorry about your birthday. 
We told each other those dates a month ago. 
I wouldn't expect you to remember mine. 
May 28th, 1987. 
10:30 in the morning. 
10:30 at night, so you're not perfect. 
Look, you have a really busy life, and you're really ambitious, which I admire, but I wanna be more than someone you get to eventually. 
And you deserve that. 
It's just I have to put the business first right now And I get that. 
I just--I think we should take a break. 
You wanna take a break? 
Maybe, yeah. 
Are you saying take a break 'cause you really mean "break up," but you're trying to be nice? 
Maybe, yeah. 
I'm sorry if this seems sudden, but I know me, and maybe it's better sooner than later. 
I'm back! 
And I brought my bridesmaids! 
Looks like business is picking up. 
It's gonna be hard not to see you. 
Yeah, it will be. 
I work 10 feet away. 
This way, ladies. 
We're gonna taste every cupcake they have! 
This is the time to take me! 
Come on, final offer! 
E.T.? Alf? 
Christina Ricci? 
﻿1 Girls, I have made a big decision. 
You're having a sex change? 
I totally support you, but be careful, Han. 
Female to male is very tricky. 
Well, you would know. 
Meow! 
He must have already started on the hormones. 
Now, here's my big decision. 
We're moving from those icky glass ketchup bottles to modern, new squeeze bottles. 
Wow, that is some fresh, outside-the-box thinking. 
It's like being an intern at Apple during the summer of '76. 
That's right. 
Call me "Han Jobs." 
Oh, I will only call you "Han Jobs." 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  I can't believe everybody else is gone, and we're stuck here doing this. 
Eew, this has a really toxic plastic smell. 
Give me that. 
Max, are you huffing a ketchup bottle? 
Mmhmm. I'm hoping 
it kills the brain cells that'll remember I'm stuck doing ketchups on a Friday night. 
Max, give it to me! 
Whether you believe it or not, you're above that. 
And you know what? 
We're above this. 
Forget this. 
Let's go out. 
I mean, I'm newly single, and you're not picky. 
True. 
I'm ready to let my hair down and have one of those crazy yet fiscally responsible kind of nights. 
You mean steal other girls' drinks when they go to the bathroom? 
Seriously, what can you do in Williamsburg if you have less than $20? 
Hang out on the sidewalk and look good till you turn 35. 
Then turn to your friends and say, "I have to move home." 
Hey, you know what? 
The Raveonettes are playing the Lorimer Lounge. 
We got a little tip money and lot of deez. 
So let's just watch the magic unfold. 
I haven't seen the Raveonettes live since I saw them in Denmark. 
That is crazy because I first heard of them when I was dry-humping a guy named Mark in his den, so... 
Twinsies! 
Wow, my life has really changed. 
The last time I was in an alley behind a club, I was in an SUV with one of the Olsen twins. 
I still don't know which one. 
Hey, speaking of the Olsen twins, I once woke up next to a garden gnome. 
Well, so much for our plan. 
Yes, we've still got "doze," but no tickets. 
There's gotta be a way for us to get in. 
What up, ladies? 
Hi. Moo. 
Whatever. 
You need tickets? 
Well, Bessie, we might be interested. 
How much? 
You can have 'em for free if the blonde one milks me. 
How bad do you want those tickets, Caroline? 
Ha, not that bad. 
Bye. Moo. 
Whatever. 
Sorry, Max, but I can't come back from pulling a strange man's teats. 
You think that, and then you do it, and it's not so bad. 
Wow, New York without money is like no magic. 
There's magic all over the city with or without money. 
You just have to make your own. 
By drinking. 
Oh. Purse beer. 
Sorry there's no purse nachos. 
I ate them all. 
Best I can do is, uh, the cheese dust down near the birth control. 
Okay, this is ratchet. 
We're just standing here like a couple of beckys. 
 Where's your magic now? 
 Oh, you wanna see magic? 
Abracadabra. 
Let me in, dumbos. 
Abra-ca-damn-dabra! 
You know, I don't know what that trash bin said to you, but you make a cute couple. 
I think it'd be a shame to break up before you got to see what your kids would look like. 
Well, it's been a rough couple of years for us, what with me considering grad school and him being a trash can, but what can I say? 
 It's love. 
 I understand. 
Americans love their garbage. 
How else would you explain The Real Housewives of... Everything? 
You're welcome for Euro Disney, by the way. 
My name's Graham. 
I'm with the band. 
Max. 
I'm with the blonde. 
You two can come and hang backstage if you like. 
Your boyfriend can stay outside and get trashed. 
Hey, ratchet-ass becky, we're in. 
Earl, I'm worried. 
I haven't seen Max since she left with that guy last night. 
I've called her a million times. 
She picked up once, and she was either having sex or fighting a bear. 
Don't you worry. 
Max can take care of herself. 
I once saw her push a truck out of her way with her mind. 
Hey, everybody. 
Hey. 
Pardon. 
Pardon my appearance, but I was just in the park running after the high school boys' track team. 
I told her it was fine with me. 
I know she will never catch one of them. 
Oh, says you. 
I'm going to the prom with Brandon. 
Yeah, if his--if his dad will lend him the car. 
Sophie, I always love when you wear that outfit. 
It makes me wanna Xana-do you. 
'Sup? 
Pip-pip and cheerio. 
Max, thank God. 
I was so worried. 
Wait, why do you look extra pretty? 
Probably the new shades I didn't pay for. 
Or the hours of him going Downton on my abbey. 
Hold up. 
No spoilers. 
I haven't started season three yet. 
Earl, you watch that show? 
Yes, I do. 
I enjoy any show where the help is white. 
So you slept with that guy? 
Oh, I really slept with that guy. 
You go, girl. 
Don't stop till you get enough! 
I'm surprised you spent the night. 
Don't you usually leave before they realize there's nothing in their wallet? 
Last night you were complaining about no magic. 
Then I woke up this morning to a view of the park and hot cinnamon rolls. 
Now I'm back at the diner but full of cinnamon rolls. 
Boom. Magic. 
Suck it, David Blaine. 
Well, at least you had fun. 
The only fun I had last night was when that cow dude passed out on his feet, and I tipped him over. 
So are you gonna see him again? 
Sunday. 
And I realize you haven't heard these words since you lost your money, but you're invited. 
So you're asking me to be the third wheel on a two-night one-night stand? 
So I guess a private plane and two tickets to the Grammys in L.A. 
won't do it for you either? 
'Cause, bitch, we're invited! 
The Grammys? 
That's so exciting. 
Oh, and my self-esteem could really use being mistaken for Taylor Swift right now. 
Which tells you how low my self-esteem is. 
The guy is sending a private plane for me. 
A private plane! 
That's how good I am in bed. 
 We're going to the Grammys! 
 What is all of the excitement? 
Han, we need the weekend off. 
We're going to the Grammys. 
The Grammys? 
On the real-real? 
Do you think you'll meet 2 Chainz? 
That's my boi! 
No, he can't be your boi, he's my boi. 
2 Chainz is the man. 
He sings my anthem. 
We represent the lollipop guild? 
I'm talking about his ode to big booty hos. 
Birthday Song is my song. 
No,Birthday Song is my song. 
Every morning in the shower I rap  All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho  Wow, that actually makes you look whiter. 
I'll give you the weekend off if you get him to sign my concert T-shirt. 
Well, we're never gonna meet him, but done. 
All my dreams are coming true! 
This is so exciting. 
I am finally going a plane ride. 
Max, you've never been on a plane? 
I've never been on a plane. 
Max, even snakes have been on a plane. 
Good morning, Madame. 
Welcome aboard. 
It's a lovely day for a flight, yes? 
I am Agnes, and if there is anything that you need at all, you can just let me know. 
Hmm? 
Cool. Cool. 
Please don't lag behind. 
I just got French bombed, and I have no idea what she said, but I think we should tip her. 
Oh, my God. 
I can't believe... 
I'm back on a private plane. 
Max, thank you so much for having sex with that stranger. 
Aw, it was my pleasure. 
Literally. 
Welcome aboard, I am Agnes. 
I can take those for you. 
Do you have luggage? 
Oh oui. 
Thank you very much Agnes, my name is Anne, she's Max. 
Oh, you are very pretty ! 
Oh, thank you. 
I'm not Angelina Jolie. 
I get that a lot. 
You speak French very well. 
 Bravo, normally people have the right words, but with a terrible accent. 
 But with you, it's like i were talking with my sister. 
Oh i don't know if i'm able to talk as well as your sister,  but i speak better than the majority of Americans  who think that the french is... 
"Le French fry." 
That's all I know. 
And every time you ice me out with her, that's what's coming your way. 
Okay, so how does this work? 
Do we need tickets? 
Where do I sit? 
Because I don't wanna embarrass myself in front of French stewart. 
Max, there are no seat assignments. 
You can sit anywhere. 
Oh, cool. 
Like A.A. 
I love a G5. 
This reminds me so much of the plane we used to have. 
Wait, Max, this plane looks very familiar. 
Max, this was my plane. 
Well, it's my plane now. 
 Wait, if this was my plane... 
 Which it isn't. 
There'd be something I hid down here for an emergency. 
Money? Gold? 
Kettle corn? 
Yep. 
My Chanel lip gloss. 
Abra-ca-damn-dabra. 
You were a billionaire, and for an emergency, you hid lip gloss? 
Just in case something went wrong. 
I wanted to look good if I was going down. 
You know they don't care what you look like as long as you go down. 
What the hell is wrong with me? 
I'm glossing like a rich gal. 
This has gotta last me two years. 
Would you like a towel? 
How much? 
Max, they're free. 
Oh, like the doughnuts at A.A. 
Jeez, that's hot! 
You should warn a bitch. 
So sorry. 
It's her first time on a plane. 
 She's excited, wait till she drinks the Champagne (AOC;) I hope she's not angry at me, but wait a minute, i'm getting the Champagne immediately... 
Every time. 
We only are waiting for one more passenger, and then we'll be departing. 
Champagne? 
Merci beaucoup. 
Ooh, the last time I had champagne was at a Filipino wedding I crashed at a Doubletree. 
Another passenger? 
I wonder who it could be. 
Probably my mother. 
Every time something great is about to happen to me, she shows up and ruins it. 
In 20 hours, we went from beer in an alley to Dom on a plane. 
That's pretty magical. 
Yeah, this could not get any better. 
Max, it did just get better. 
That's 2 Chainz. 
I can't believe it. 
Good morning. 
How y'all doing? 
Cool. Cool. 
All right. 
Monsieur Deux Chainz, good morning. 
Coffee, water, champagne? 
No, I'm really tired. 
I just wanna crash. 
Not the plane. 
Do you have any sleepy time tea? 
"Sleepy time tea"? 
That is so gangster! 
Oh, we're moving. 
Max, buckle your seat belt. 
We're about to take off. 
I'm a little scared. 
What's it gonna feel like? 
Oh, that's it? 
That feels familiar. 
Guess I have a private plane in my nightstand. 
I can't believe this. 
I'm standing in a flying living room eating ham. 
That's prosciutto from Italy. 
It's ham from right over there. 
And I'm about to go ham on this ham. 
It's been two hours. 
When is 2 Chainz gonna wake up? 
I want a picture. 
You want him to wake up for a picture? 
I'll handle that. 
Anything? 
Nothing. 
Do it again. 
Wow, that sleepy time really knocks you out. 
He must have two-bagged it. 
He's totally out. 
Let's just do it. 
Wait, we're just gonna take his picture,  nothing else, right? 
 Yes. 
Okay, 'cause I can see how these things can get out of hand. 
 Okay, I'm first. 
 No, no, no, I'm first. 
It's my plane. 
Well, actually it's my plane. 
Was your plane. 
It's mine now. 
I had morning sex for it with a leg cramp. 
Wait, do another, do another. 
Good one. 
New Facebook default. 
In fact, this is my new default pic for everything including my tombstone. 
Since you did boobs, I'm gonna put my booty in his face, 'cause all he wants for his birthday is a big booty ho. 
Closer. 
I can't get both of you. 
Get closer. 
I never get tired of waking up like this. 
Oh, Mr. Chainz, 
I am so mortified. 
I didn't wanna bother you. 
I just gonna be cool. 
Oh, that ship sailed with the butt pic and then crashed with "Mr. Chainz." 
I just wanted a picture because I am such a huge fan. 
And I wanted to wish you luck tonight at the Grammys because your music means a lot to me. 
And I totally related when you said  When I die bury me inside the Gucci store   True. 
 ♪ When I die  bury me inside the Louis store   Unh. 
 ♪ All I want for my birthday  is a big booty ho  all I want for my birthday is a big booty ho  Yeah. 
Hey, what's the party, players? 
I heard "booty" and I heard "ho," so I had to do a pop-in. 
Always some weird white guy coming to crash a party. 
Chainz. 
Stop. 
No way. 
I can't believe it's you flying this plane. 
Caroline, it's been so long since I've seen you. 
 Bring it in. 
 Oh, Max, this is Bill. 
 The pilot. 
 The pilot? 
Why is he walking around? 
Brace for crash! 
Brace for crash! 
It's okay, it's on autopilot. 
Autopilot. 
That's how I live my life. 
Pilot Bill is an old pal. 
He used to fly my friends and I around in college. 
Yeah, good times. 
This is my friend, Max, and it's her very first time on an airplane. 
Hey, mine too. 
J.K. 
Listen, Max, why don't you take a stroll down there and check out the cockpit? 
The cockpit? 
If it's anything like the gay bar on 14th street, I'm not dressed right. 
It is so good to see you. 
And, God, I'd forgotten how beautiful you are. 
Oh, thank you, Pilot Bill. 
You know, I never thought I had a chance with you before because you had so much money and I was 20 years older, but now you're broke and I had a facelift, so we're kinda on the same level. 
Oh, a facelift? 
That's why your face is so tight and pink? 
I thought maybe you were in a fire. 
But you look good. 
 Sure, let's go out. 
 Great. 
I'm gonna grab a coffee. 
I'll be right back. 
What you doing going out with a guy like that? 
Well, here's the thing, 2. 
You don't tell the pilot flying the plane you're on that you don't wanna go out with him. 
Got you. 
You just keep flirting with him until we land. 
I gotta make it to the Grammys. 
So, Max, you've really never been on a plane before? 
Well, technically it's my second time if you count Rock-O-Plane ride at the carnival. 
Guess I was rockin' that plane too hard, 'cause halfway through the ride, my mini-747 fell off its gears, and I crashed to the ground. 
There would have been a lawsuit, but the carnie paid me off with a snow cone, and also no one cared about me as a child. 
Well, go ahead, put your hands on the wheel. 
 Give it a spin. 
 No, I'm good. 
Wow, we are really up there. 
I have never been this high. 
And trust me, I have been high. 
Yeah, I hear that. 
No one liked to get high more than me. 
I did everything pills, weed, coke, and what's that called when you crumble the coke on your weed? 
Anyway, I loved to get high. 
But that's all way behind me now. 
I've been clean and sober ever since that Denzel Flight movie came out. 
It's still in the theaters. 
Yep, saw it last week. 
Maybe I will put my hands on the wheel. 
You know, just in case. 
It's the carnival ride all over again! 
I broke the plane! 
I broke the plane! 
Okay, everything's under control. 
Just sit down, sit down. 
Put your seat belt on. 
And, uh, Caroline, here's my cellular. 
Of course, you can always still get me at my mom's, so  Go save the plane! 
Yeah. Yeah. 
We'll be fine. 
I was not meant to die as the second banana in a cross-country booty call. 
_ _ What did she say? 
I have no idea. 
I heard "love" and "why now?" 
So just in case. 
I should tell you I took $10 out of the cupcake fund for a Big Mac and never told you. 
I should tell you I took $100 out of the cupcake fund to keep my hair this naturally blonde. 
Okay, everybody. 
We got a bit of a situation. 
Looks like my new girlfriend's friend broke the plane. 
No, I'm just kidding. 
We had some engine trouble. 
We're going to have to make an emergency landing in Kansas. 
Go, Chiefs! 
Hey, blondie. 
Why don't you keep us in the air? 
How about you go give the pilot a little love? 
Okay. 
Okay, thank you. 
Well, good news. 
We're not stranded here. 
I just got off the phone, and according to my new boyfriend, Captain facelift, your new boyfriend, the brit, is flying us hg tomorrow on a commercial flight. 
Coach. 
What? 
I don't do coach. 
And I am pretty positive 2 Chainz would have taken us on that other plane they sent if you hadn't rapped for 30 minutes in that corn field after we landed. 
I don't care what you say. 
I burned that corn field up. 
Here, let's eat something. 
They delivered the food. 
Slim Jims, Cheez-its, Pizza Pringles, and two ham and cheese sandwiches. 
Ham? 
Where's the prosciutto? 
There is none. 
Mais pourquoi? 
Because we're at a motel in Kansas. 
And the lady at the front desk called me a snob for ordering the Pizza Pringles. 
I can't believe I'm not at the Grammys, and I'm stuck here eating a lousy vending machine sandwich. 
Well, it's better than doing those ketchups in the diner. 
And crash-landing in a corn field with a rap star with our heads still attached that's pretty magical, right? 
Yeah, and 2 Chainz did say he enjoyed meeting us and that we're two fine, big booty hos. 
That's pretty magical. 
Han's gonna be so jealous when he finds out I met our boy. 
Oh, my God, we forgot to get Han's T-shirt signed. 
Or did we? 
When you don't have enough money to fix your own mistakes, you've gotta make your own magic. 
Max, it's 2 Chainz with a "z" not an "s." 
Damn! The one time 
I know how to spell something, and it comes back to bite me in the ass. 
Ooh, it's starting. 
Ready to go to the Grammys? 
Don't get any ham on the dress. 
We have to return these to get our money back. 
You think Beyonce's saying that right now? 
Hey, if we can make our own magic,  we can make our own Grammys. 
 The Grammys... 
Max Black, who are you wearing? 
Who are you wearing? 
My roommate's rent. 
You're right, this is pretty magical. 
But wait, I think it can get better. 
Beyonce, Faith Hill, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Mumford & Sons, Keith Urban, The Black Keys, Jack White, and look who's opening up the night Taylor Swift. 
See? 
Way more magical. 
You know, this kind of feels like the private plane. 
Yeah, the one I have in my nightstand. 
﻿1 Max, look, the mailman came. 
Where am I looking, your chest, yo hair? 
Gimme a hint. 
It's here. 
Our eviction notice. 
It's amazing you can send this much shame for just 46 cents. 
What, you miss three out of six months and you're out? 
We're batting .500. 
That's hall of fame stuff right there. 
Hi, girls. 
I just stopped by to get a cupcake to eat on the way to the gym. 
Here, have a seat. 
I'll get you your usual. 
Max, where are the lemon meringue cupcakes? 
Stopped making 'em. 
And the fudge berries and the purple velvets. 
We have so many left over every day that even the homeless lady I give them to at night was like, "Girl, your shop in trouble, ain't it?" 
So what, Max? 
You think we should take business advice from a woman who thinks our nation's currency should be the McNugget? 
She makes a good point. 
Uhoh. 
I think it's getting a little too real in here for me. 
I'm gonna go push up my boobs and glue my tooth back on. 
Seriously, what are we gonna do about this? 
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. 
Aww, you ripped up an eviction notice. 
That's the one thing my mother and I used to do together. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Max, I know our shop's in trouble. 
It's all I think about. 
Even in my sexual fantasies, I'm giving Ryan Gosling a rent check. 
I just wish we had a sign that told us what to do. 
See? Customers. 
That's a sign to stay open. 
Here, pretend to be busy. 
We'll send those right out. 
Thank you for calling, Oprah. 
Hi, I'm Joanne Morse. 
I wish I was rich enough to have somedy talk for me. 
Max, are you blind? 
She's deaf. 
Oh. So cool. 
I've wanted to be deaf ever since she moved in. 
I'm a representative from Tenner Commercial Real Estate. 
We're acquiring this property and would like to offer you a corporate buy out. 
I understood that better when she said it. 
Thank you very much, but we're not interested. 
I speak a little sign language. 
You just said "Thank you very much, but I'm not wearing underwear." 
I knew that tutor was screwing with me. 
And I'm the one not wearing underwear. 
We're ready to offer you $25,000 to take over your lease. 
Hell yes, bitch. 
Max, no. 
What are you doing? 
This shop is our dream. 
Well, our dream is turning into a nightmare and no one's coming to wake us up. 
This is our future. 
I'm sorry, thank you very much, but we're gonna pass. 
Our business is booming. 
Oh, yeah. 
Look at him. 
Yeah. 
Come on and vogue. 
Yes. 
Yeah, dance to the music. 
Yeah. 
Remember when Madonna was alive? 
Those were the good old days. 
We'll give you some time to think about it, but with your delinquent rent history, if you stay, we would need six months' rent up front. 
So I'd take the $25,000. 
It's a good deal. 
$25,000? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
Uh, uh, we... call... you. 
Okay? 
Yeah. 
Sophie, it's none of your business. 
This is our decision. 
You said you were looking for a sign. 
What's more of a sign than sign language? 
No. 
End of story. 
I would not sell this shop for all the McNuggets in the world. 
I still believe in our dream, and it does not end with an offer from the def real estate jam. 
Women. Am I right? 
Earl, I need some advice. 
Caroline and I were offered money to buy out the cupcake store, and as my spirit animal, Kenny Rogers, once asked, "When do you hold 'em and when do you fold 'em?" 
Well, Max, there are two things in life you've got to hold on to: Your dreams, and your receipt when you're leaving Best Buy. 
Oh, you do not want to be a black man without a receipt. 
Mm-mm. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
Max, did you just give me the cold shoulder? 
Oh, my God, I've been doing that for a year and a half and you finally got it. 
I'm sorry for storming out earlier, but we just can't give it up that easy. 
I can, and have, and will again. 
Maybe it's better if we just get out now. 
I heard a customer saying a Whole Foods is going in over there. 
You know who goes to Whole Foods? 
Rich ladies with those freaky toe sneakers. 
And I cannot be seeing no freaky toe sneakers. 
Whole Foods? 
That's the sign I've been looking for. 
No wonder they wanted to get rid of us. 
With a Whole Foods there, they can raise everybody's rent. 
That's fine, we don't pay it anyway. 
I knew it was gonna be the hot new neighborhood. 
I knew it! 
This is it, Max. 
First comes the Whole Foods, then come the gays, then the celebrities. 
Well, the gays will come anyway as long as there's a park. 
Seriously, Max, it's just a matter of time before we're telling Anne Hathaway, "Forget that fake smile and just go wait in line like everybody else." 
Han, they're opening up a Whole Foods right near our cupcake shop. 
Another Whole Foods? 
They won't be happy till it's "Whole Country," am I right? 
I saw that on a meme. 
Now we have to stay in that neighborhood. 
We just have to come up with six months rent up front. 
Well, I'd love to help you, ladies, but I forgot my PIN number in 2008. 
Wait a minute, 2008. 
That's my PIN number! 
You want my money? 
Ehr mah gerd. 
I've been looking at a lot of memes. 
Oh, that's who you look like. 
Grumpy cat! 
Max, I know we've borrowed from everyone we know, but I'm so convinced that this is the right thing that I'm willing to stoop to something I never thought I'd do. 
Look, you're sweet and you're adorable, but you're way too bony to bring in more than 40 a night. 
And even if you got an animal sidekick, it's still not gonna get us there. 
It would get me there. 
We can make an appointment, go into the city, and ask my aunt Charity for the money. 
She's president of a cosmetic empire and she's filthy rich. 
And how is she literally the only thing you've never talked about? 
Because she hates me. 
That's what family is. 
People who hate you, but can't kill you 'cause they're the first ones questioned. 
I'm surprised you're still waiting. 
Most people leave after two hours. 
Well, it's not a problem for us. 
We'll wait two hours, three, a whole day. 
That sounds about right. 
Stephanie. 
Coming. 
That's not my name, but I'm afraid to tell her. 
So why doesn't your aunt like you? 
I don't know. 
She just doesn't like me. 
For example, one time, when I was ten, and we were at our Hamptons beach house I already don't like you. 
I wanted my night-night cocoa in my special seagull mug Now I hate you. 
And my aunt Charity, who was babysitting because everybody else was in Europe at the dressage competition... 
Now I've beat you up and left you for dead. 
Told me my seagull cup was broken and I knew it wasn't. 
And when I wouldn't stop crying, she locked me in my bedroom, and when the servants weren't looking, pulled my hair. 
Love her. 
You can go in now. 
It's not that big a deal, Kevin. 
We're launching a lipstick at Target, not a missile at Iran. 
Aunt Charity, hi. 
Caroline, look at you. 
Gorgeous, beautiful. 
You stuck with that nose. 
Good for you. 
And who's this with the great lips? 
Aunt Charity, this is my friend and business partner, Max. 
Nice to meet you. 
Did she tell you I pulled her hair? 
Oh, it was legend around the family townhouse. 
My brother came into my room. 
"Did you pull my princess's hair? 
She said you pulled her hair." 
I mean, come on. 
She's 10, I'm 23. 
What, I'm just gonna reach up and pull her hair? 
I mean, how would that happen? 
Ow. 
I mean, who would just pull a child's hair? 
Ow. 
I mean, come on. 
I'm gonna pull her hair? 
 Ow. 
 Pull her hair? 
 Ow! Ow! 
 Pull her hair? 
Ow! Okay, 
you just pulled my hair. 
Oh, my God, here we go again. 
Get the lawyers. 
Come on, have a seat. 
Have a seat in the big girl chair. 
You're a big girl now. 
Aunt Charity, thank you so much for seeing us. 
I know your time is very valuable. 
I have all the time in the world for you. 
You're family. 
Stephanie, I'm not doing anything important. 
Bring me those documents to sign. 
I haven't seen this one since I was 25 and my parents cut me off. 
You sleep with one Pakistani lesbian, you're out of the family. 
Here, you with the big lips, try these. 
Tell me which ones you hate. 
Aunt Charity started her makeup empire at 26 when she invented bubblegum-flavored lip gloss. 
Oh, my God, that was you? 
I loved that. 
I was wearing that during my first kiss. 
And thank you, because I got an "A" in that class. 
Every girl who loves lipstick loves me, except for this one, who hates me Because I was so mean and I broke her night-night cocoa cup. 
Aunt Charity, I never said you were mean. 
I was ten, and I just got a little confused about what happened to my seagull cup. 
But I'm an adult now. 
When I go night-night, I barely even think about that cocoa cup. 
Caroline, I was 23. 
I don't remember anything about a cup. 
All I remember about that weekend was that Versace was murdered and my dress would obviously be late. 
Now, why are you here? 
Tell me. You have my full 
and undivided attention. 
Where and where? 
Well, Aunt Charity, as you may or may not know, I now have a start-up business. 
Hey, is it me, or does this look like a dog penis? 
She's fun. 
Seems professional. 
Good choice. 
And, as you know, I've always respected your business acumen. 
 Even when I was a little  How much? 
Fine, businesswoman to businesswoman I need a number. 
Give me a number. 
25,000. 
And all these lipsticks, including dog penis. 
And I'm not asking for a handout. 
 This is a business opportunity. 
 No. 
Maybe--no. 
Look, Caroline, if this were truly a business transaction, you'd have cupcakes here to show me, but you don't. 
I know all about your business. 
Stephanie googled you. 
She has the strength to Google? 
Has she googled "How to eat"? 
See yourselves out. 
I'm going to my dermatologist for a little procedure. 
I want to take two years off my face just so people will think, "Is she 38 or 39? 
It's so hard to tell." 
But just so you know, you were my last chance to keep my dream and our business alive. 
You're resourceful. 
You'll think of something. 
Now come here. 
In spite of it all, we are family. 
Give me a hug. 
Ow! 
Wow. 
She's kind of a monster, but she gave me free stuff, so I'm torn. 
Aunt Charity's a smart businesswoman. 
She won't be able to deny a good product. 
I can't believe I'm making cupcakes so you can go back for round two with that woman. 
Auntie Charity might be the anti-Christ. 
I'll do anything to keep our business going. 
And if these cupcakes don't work, we'll tell her you're Pakistani and let her go after it. 
Even if you do convince her to give us the money, that's bitch money. 
We don't take bitch money. 
Max, you pick up pennies off the pee corner. 
Not true. 
Dimes and up. 
Hi! 
We'll just be a second. 
 Oh, no. Oh, no. 
 Cool hair, David Bowie. 
Okay, she's definitely not seeing anyone today. 
Sorry to burst in, Aunt Charity, but we wanted you to have some of our cupcakes. 
It took two layers to take off two years, but it was worth it. 
Just so you know, the third layer is bone. 
Either I'm high, or my chair melted. 
Okay, you're high. 
She's on morphine lollipops for the pain. 
Really? 'Cause I'd like 
to be on one for the fun. 
 I got that boom boom boom   I got that boom boom boom  I got that boom boom boom  Okay, it's time to change your face mask. 
You know what? 
Let me do that. 
I can help my aunt Charity. 
I'll do anything to help someone in my family because families help each other. 
Well, why don't you help yourself to an adult-sized pair of boobies? 
Like my boobs, like my nose. 
Okay, here's the new face mask. 
You peel the soiled one off, then swab the affected area with Q-tips. 
And I left modeling because I thought it was degrading. 
 Question, Stephanie. 
 Yeah? 
Do these come in orange, or lime, or is it just the white flavor? 
Ah, screw it. 
After a couple of licks, it won't matter. 
I'm happy to do this for you, Aunt Charity, and not just for the money, but 'cause we're family. 
I hate you. 
Always have. 
You can't mean that, Aunt Charity. 
Up until you were born, I was the family princess. 
And then you came in, and you got the boom boom boom and you took my boom boom boom. 
So I locked you in a room room room. 
Well, I'm sorry you think I took your boom boom boom, but you really did take my seagull cup and lock me in a room. 
Room room. 
I'm not giving you any money, little girl. 
Just so you know. 
Well, maybe you'll feel differently after you taste one of our cupcakes. 
Here, why don't we take a minute for a little bite? 
Nope, I don't want it. 
It'll show you what a good business investment we are. 
Here, come--come here. 
Just--oh--just taste it. 
Here. 
Come on, taste take a bite. 
This is pretty disturbing. 
I would intervene right now if I wasn't feeling amazing. 
Yummy, right? 
Oh, no, no, no, no. 
No, no, no, that's your face. 
I think you're chewing your face. 
That's the best cupcake I have ever had, but I am still not giving you any money. 
Why not? 
It's the least you could do after you broke my seagull cup. 
Oh, my God, are you still talking about that seagull cup? 
I haven't thought about that in 15 years. 
If we're gonna be talking about that stupid seagull cup, I'm gonna need another lollipop. 
Where does she keep them? 
Oh, here, they're in this cup that has a seagull on it. 
Wait. 
Where have I heard of seagull cup before? 
That's my night-night cocoa cup. 
I knew it wasn't broken. 
You hid it and kept it all these years? 
Yep. 
Why would you want to hurt me like that? 
It's obvious. 
She's obsessed with her brother, and she saw your being born as his love being taken away from her. 
Damn, this thing makes me smart. 
Well, I hope you're happy now, because I lost a lot more than my night-night cocoa cup. 
I lost my money, my father, and now I'm about to lose my dream. 
And you know what? 
We're done. 
You know what? 
We are not done. 
I am not a quitter. 
I said I would put your new face on, so I'm not leaving here until I do. 
Her face is gone. 
She's basically the Phantom of the Channing. 
All right, that's close enough. 
And stop calling me spoiled. 
Since I lost it all, I've worked hard. 
I've cleaned toilets, I've killed rats, I've done everything I had to to be a success. 
Tell her, Max. 
 I got that boom boom boom   ♪ I got that boom  Okay, fine. Let's go. 
Stop. 
Fine, I'll give you the money. 
Not--not just because you're my niece, but because you forced yourself in here like a pushy businesswoman, which is you shoved your cupcake down my throat. 
That is exactly what I would have done. 
25,000, signed Char-ity Chan... 
Oh, no. 
Aunt Charity, are you all right? 
Oh, and she didn't finish signing it. 
Well, it's my last name too, so... 
...ing. 
I can't get it out from under her head. 
Pull her hair! 
Now's your chance. 
Ow. 
Bob, I don't feel you are getting across my passion about this, so I'll just sign it. 
That check should have cleared. 
That time, you said, "Your face looks like a butt." 
I appreciate how hard you've tried to stay in business, but do the smart thing. 
Take the money. 
Start fresh. 
All you have to do is sign this. 
Well, we will have to discuss it. 
 My partner has a be  Just sign it. 
Good discussion. 
Caroline Chan Max, a little help. 
...ing. 
So, as of this moment, this space is no longer Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
Congratulations and good luck. 
Well, there goes Joanne and that deaf lady. 
We are keeping the arrow. 
I can't believe my aunt would stop payment on that check. 
And I can't believe she'd show up here after she did. 
Aunt Charity, do you know what I'm thinking about you right now? 
What? I look 38 or 39, 
it's hard to tell? 
Oh, don't look so wounded. 
You know I had to stop that check. 
You took advantage of someone in a morphine haze. 
If you think that was being taken advantage of, you've never blacked out at a pep rally. 
Yes, I stopped that check, but here. 
This seems important to you. 
Seemed. 
Seemed when I was rich. 
Now I have real problems. 
Yeah, and where are them lollipops at? 
 You took away my future. 
 And my lollipops. 
No, Caroline, I took away my money. 
And by forcing you to find you own way, I may have given you a better future. 
Cute shop. 
Too big, too soon. 
You'll figure it out. 
Aunt Charity? 
You look 42. 
We all know I don't. 
The shop's over. 
Wow, I thought for sure we'd be a success. 
Well, who says we're not? 
I mean, we had some fun, right? 
And we have a cool-ass red arrow. 
And we have this big check, which is just enough to pay back Sophie and everybody else we owe money to. 
That's true. 
So in a way, we're kind of success. 
I mean, we did go from broke to broke even. 
We nailed it. 
I just wish we had a clear-cut sign that letting go of this place was the right thing to do. 
Ehr mah gerd! 
My night-night cocoa cup. 
You wanted a sign? 
That's your sign! 
No matter what hits you, you'll be okay. 
Well, I feel sorry for whoever owns this dump. 
﻿1 Oh, yeah, baby. 
Oh, take it all! 
Oh, oh, no, you take it, baby. 
No, baby, you take it all! 
 Oh, no, you take it, baby. 
 No, baby, you take it! 
Dear God, will one of you just take it and get it over with? 
Max, there is no way you could be sleeping through Oleg and Sophie. 
Does that actually work? 
It does, with a little help from this. 
Gimme. 
Whoo! 
I was hoping that'd be fruitier. 
I mean, they're here. 
They're there. 
Then, they're here again. 
It's like we're a village under attack. 
Yup, just a matter of time till someone sends in a drone. 
And it's not just that moaning. 
I think I heard a big ball rolling around up there. 
If a ball is rolling around up there, Oleg should stop and see a doctor. 
This couldn't be any more intrusive. 
Oh! 
Uhoh. 
Sorry about that. 
A bowling ball? 
And why do they need a bowling ball? 
Maybe they ran out of holes. 
Have you guys seen a ball? 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Pick up, Max. 
And sorry about the hole in your ceiling. 
Oleg, I'm not even gonna ask you to keep it in your pants anymore, but could you keep it in your apartment? 
 Oh, hey, Sophie. 
 Hey, Max. 
Oh, spring is in the air. 
This is the time of year in Poland when the snow would melt and all our dead relatives would float back to us. 
I've never been to Europe, but it sounds beautiful. 
Max, where is Caroline? 
And don't tell me she's in the ladies' room, because I already peeked under all those stalls. 
She wasn't there. 
But I saw things. 
Well, congratulations on finally seeing those things. 
She's 20 minutes late, and, as the boss, I will not have it. 
Wow, someone woke up on the wrong side of his crib. 
You're late. 
This is unacceptable. 
Don't mind him. 
He just saw his first vagina, and he's furious. 
Okay, here's the thing. 
I had to take a nap because Oleg and Sophie were having sex all night long. 
Not true. 
We took a break to watch a porno. 
Punctuality is the number one rule in my employee handbook, which I've adorably named the Han-book. 
Relax, Han. 
Nobody's gonna die if I'm not here to drop off a tuna melt. 
In fact, they're more likely to die if I do drop it off. 
Late, and with an attitude. 
You think you're too good for the diner? 
Of course she thinks that. 
I think sourdough bread is too good for this diner. 
Well, what other career option do you have, Caroline? 
Hmm, let's see. 
Cupcakes? 
No, wait, your shop didn't last six months. 
 Don't go there, Han. 
 Oh, I'm already there. 
And now I'm back. 
Why so moody, Han? 
Are you man-struating? 
Is it that time of the man-th? 
That shop was our dream, Han, and this is just a dumb diner. 
 You're fired. 
 Ooh! I'm fired? 
Max, Han just fired me. 
You lucky son of a whore. 
I'm serious, Caroline. 
You called my diner "dumb." 
Well, at least my diner's still open and successful, whereas your cupcake shop was so dumb, it failed. 
Ooh, he did not go there. 
I went there, and then I came back, and then I went there again. 
You know what? 
I don't need this. 
Well, actually, you do kinda need this 'cause we broke. 
Broke or not, I don't have to stand here and take this. 
 I quit. 
 Oh, really? You quit? 
You must be dumber than my diner because I already fired you. 
Han, I know you've had it up to here, but you need to relax. 
Can you believe Han fired me? 
I mean, where does he get off? 
Probably in Buffy The Vampire Slayer chat rooms. 
Have you been standing here by the door this whole time? 
I didn't even pee. 
I was afraid I'd miss you. 
So, hold on. 
So, basically, you had the same day as a puppy? 
Han's lucky I work there. 
I bring class and sophistication to that place. 
There's no toilet paper, and I just used the last coffee filter. 
You are sophisticatin' the hell out of that toilet right now. 
And you know what? 
You can tell Han that the only way I am ever going back there is if he apologizes. 
Okay, but first, he wanted me to tell you this. 
The only way you're ever going back there is if you apologize. 
Well, an apology from me is not happening. 
Oh, yeah, baby. 
Ooh, take it all. 
Oh, oh, no, you take it, baby. 
Oh, baby And that is not happening again tonight either. 
Again? 
That could've hit us. 
Now, that's unsafe sex. 
I think it's pretty neighborly of us to return someone's sex bowling ball. 
You know we have to bury those mitts now. 
And we have to tell them to stop whatever it is they're doing up here. 
Probably a 7-10 split. 
And now they're not making noise. 
It's like when you go to the zoo, and the lion goes inside. 
It's Max and Caroline. 
Your ball came into our yard again. 
Hi. 
Yeah, it's not a good time. 
Uh, we're role-playing, and, obviously, I'm Beyonce. 
 Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh  Yeah. 
Hey, Jay Z? 
Look at all the single ladies. 
Oh, yeah, baby. 
Jay Z and I have a lot in common. 
He bought the Brooklyn Nets. 
I bought my hairnets in Brooklyn. 
I'm not surprised that you're Jay Z and Beyonce, but I am kinda surprised that they bowl. 
Where should I put this? 
Oh, well, I'll tell you what I told him. 
Put it anywhere you want. 
So that's basically our ball at this point. 
Look, you two may be crazy in love, but your love is driving us crazy. 
Crazy in love? 
Oh, come on. 
We're not in love. 
Oleg and I are just shtup buddies. 
Shtup buddies? 
I wouldn't say that's all we are. 
Oh, no, you're right. 
We also share a CVS points reward card. 
Is it really a reward if it comes from CVS? 
Can't you two ever do it over at Oleg's apartment? 
Or are all the lanes reserved? 
I have no idea where he lives. 
Wait, you've never been to Oleg's apartment? 
No, with my busy work schedule, I don't have the time to get the battery of shots that I would need. 
Hey. 
Hey, hey. 
You'd be surprised by my apartment, Sophie. 
It's more than just the place the quadruple orgasm was born. 
Yeah, well, that sounds nice. 
Oh, yes. 
Beyonc Uh-oh. 
Yeah. 
Um, Beyonce's hair just fell out. 
I gotta go get my hot glue gun. 
 Uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh   uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh  Girls, I may have oversold my apartment. 
What, by saying she won't need to get shots? 
Yes. 
Maybe you two could help me fix it up a little, give it a feminine touch. 
Well, I'm out. 
You know what? 
I'll do it. 
But I'm very recently out of work, so I'm gonna have to charge you. 
If you didn't, you'd be the only girl who ever went to his apartment without getting paid. 
You got a deal. 
Oleg's apartment's this way. 
I can smell the axe body spray. 
I'll just throw a couple of these pillows around, and then we'll be gone. 
I can't believe I'm walking up to Oleg's apartment. 
I always thought I'd be dragged here unconscious with electrical tape over my mouth. 
Afternoon, ladies. 
This is where the magic happens. 
Well, I'm sure you've made some women disappear here. 
Okay. 
Just off the top of my head, I think we're gonna need a couple more pillows. 
If you keep your apartment like this, do you get to pay 1980s rent prices? 
You haven't even seen the best part yet. 
Look. 
Goin' up the stairway to heaven, baby. 
Oh, yeah. 
There it is. 
That's my bed. 
Where are we? 
Studio 69? 
That's 1,500 tracer bulbs. 
I tore most of them out of the new Cineplex 14 in Queens. 
First of all, I am smelling something that can only be described as anti-antiperspirant. 
And, secondly... 
No woman wants to walk into this. 
According to this, 685 already have. 
Actually, it's 1,685. 
After a thousand, the counter resets. 
Look, if you don't want Sophie to feel like she's next in line at the DMV... 
More like the S-T-D-MV. 
Then we have a lot of work to do. 
Okay. 
Make it look romantic. 
When she comes in, I want her to feel special, like she's the only woman that's ever been here today. 
Let's just sit down and talk about this. 
Oh, my God. 
Max, is she dead? 
No. 
She's Alexis. 
You have one of those anatomically-correct real dolls! 
It's rare to see one without a short, fat man standing next to it with a button penis. 
They sell for $6,000, but I got her for half off. 
She was previously loved. 
Max, you are not doing that. 
The hell I'm not. 
This is my one chance to see a woman naked without having to spoon her after. 
Respect. 
Well, you've made a lot of strong choices here, but I'm not sure they're all working together. 
For example, that sex swing is fighting the goat. 
Now, why don't we start by you going and getting us some rubber gloves? 
Lots of them, and the strongest bleach and soap products you can find. 
Oh, and a Hazmat suit. 
Don't worry about the size. 
I can belt it. 
But you're gonna keep my good stuff, right? 
If I see any, I'll consider it. Go. 
What are you going to do with Alexis? 
Rehab, and then a women's shelter in Montana. 
Go! 
I've got a lot of work to do. 
But first... 
And I do it. 
And I do it. 
Can you please turn that off, Max? 
I'm starting to feel a little dizzy... 
And I can't fall on the floor, 'cause I might stick to it. 
You don't have to do this! 
Just call Han and apologize, and we can get outta here before the syphilis sets in. 
No, he said some really hurtful things to me, and I'd rather stay here and work for Oleg and Alexis. 
At least I'll have my dignity. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go climb the sperm-ship Enterprise. 
Let me just get these curtains open so I can see better. 
Seeing better? 
Is that the way to go? 
Oh. 
I'm walking on a water bed. 
This is harder than it looks. 
How many times has that been said on this bed? 
Oh, my heel! 
I swallowed! 
I accidentally swallowed. 
You know that's been said. 
Max, we got a problem. 
See that girl? 
Oh, what? 
The usual drill? 
You hold her arms, and I punch her till she tips 20%? 
As much as I enjoy that when we do it, no. 
She's here to apply for Caroline's job. 
What? 
Han's really going through with this? 
I thought it was all talk, like when a Chihuahua barks at a big dog. 
Me too. 
I thought it would blow over. 
You know, like Han did in the wind that time? 
But, no, he is serious. 
No way. 
I got this. 
Hi, is that your resume? 
Let's take a little look-see. 
Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. 
Oh, you worked there? 
Cool. 
Yep. 
I'm a very hard worker. 
Good. 
Can you block a punch? 
'Cause the owner hits us. 
He broke my femur. 
When I complained, he broke the other one. 
Run before he sees me talking to you. 
Earl, I gotta get Han and Caroline to make up. 
I don't have access to the pills I need to keep working here without her. 
Any advice or pills? 
Well, let's see. 
We are kind of like a family here, except I can see you unsupervised on the weekends. 
And you didn't use my college fund to buy a married man a Corvette. 
And in my family, when my kids would fight, I tried to get them to talk to each other, because honesty is key. 
But if that didn't work, I'd lie to their faces lock them in their room and tell them that the other one had three weeks to live. 
You know, what used to be known as good parenting. 
Max, I've got 12 overqualified candidates coming in for the waitress position today. 
Thank you, crumbling economy! 
You know, Han, here at this diner, we're kind of like a little family, and oh, I can't do this. 
Caroline has three weeks left to live. 
I'm serious. 
She drank Oleg's water bed. 
It's just a matter of time. 
Nice try, Max. 
I'm not going to give her back her job. 
She should've checked herself before she wrecked herself. 
Come on. 
Hire her back. 
Be the bigger man. 
And note, I did not make a short joke, because this is important, and also because I'm still working on something with Peter Dinklage's name. 
No way, Max. 
I am holding firm. 
You know, firm Han is kinda hot. 
 He is? 
 Yeah. 
I'm kinda feeling firm Han. 
I have no interest in feeling the firm part, but I'll hang out with the rest. 
You want to hang out with me? 
I'm generally free mondays through Fridays, mornings and evenings, and my weekends are wide open. 
I may have a wedding to go to in June, but Breathe. 
Come over tomorrow. 
Caroline will be at Oleg's. 
We can get stoned and watch a movie. 
The last time I was stoned was from a contact high I got at a concert. 
Well, those wiggle shows do get crazy. 
Look at us, Max, hanging outside of work at your place like a couple of homeys. 
Yeah, and where is my homey? 
Oh, it's this way. 
I can smell the axe body spray. 
Now, what movie should we watch? 
I brought Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Shrek 3-D, and that Cameron Diaz cancer movie. 
Is there one where Shrek has cancer? 
Wow. 
This is completely the same place I always live at. 
Max, it's so pretty. 
I thought your place would have furniture made out of razor blades or something. 
I wish. 
That sounds bitchin'. 
What are you guys doing here? 
What is Caroline doing here? 
You said she was going to be at Oleg's. 
I am at Oleg's. 
You guys live with Oleg? 
You told him this was our apartment? 
As a wise person once told me, sometimes, you gotta lie to keep your family together. 
I'm not letting anyone leave until you talk to each other. 
I don't understand. 
Are we not smoking weed? 
Oh, I already did. 
I don't know what his problem is. 
He fired me for missing 20 minutes of work. 
Why doesn't he fire himself for missing puberty? 
Let it go, Han. 
She spent her morning dusting a strap-on. 
I didn't fire you because you were late. 
I fired you because you crapped all over the diner, and you forgot that diner lifted you up when you had nothing. 
Well, I lifted you up when you couldn't reach the canned corn. 
So, we're even. 
Fight over. 
What the hell did you do to my apartment? 
It looks like you could film a douche commercial in here. 
Oleg, this is what you asked for: Romantic. 
Romantic? 
My place went from Fifty Shades of Grey to fifty shades of beige. 
Where's my sex swing? 
Where's my sex chair? 
Where's my poster that says, "Poke her in the front, lick her in the back"? 
Oleg, relax. 
All your stuff's either in the basement or the closet. 
And I think would know more about what a woman would like to come home to than a man whose last girlfriend was made in the Philippines. 
It's me! 
Hide your kids! 
Hide your wife! 
Sophie! 
She can't know you're here. 
Go, go, all of you. 
Han! 
Get in the closet! 
Putting a guy who's in the closet in the closet? 
That's like gay nesting dolls. 
I'm not gay. 
I'm a metrosexual. 
This is where the magic happens? 
Oh. 
Oh, no. 
Do you live with your mother? 
What? 
You don't like? 
I thought you would enjoy the girl's touch. 
What girls? 
The Golden Girls? 
Sophie hates it. 
I should've just thrown a boiled ham on the bed. 
Oh, no. 
My hair's stuck in Oleg's clothes. 
Please don't let it be a pant zipper. 
Oh. 
Han, Alexis. 
Alexis, Han. 
Ew, take it away from me. 
It's so heavy Oh, no, oh, no. 
Help. 
Get her off of me. 
Why? 
You're finally getting some. 
Take it... take it! 
I got it, I got it.. 
Oh... Oh... 
Oh... Whoa.... 
Look! Han's fallen 
and he can't get it up! 
What the hell is going on here? 
I mean, this is freaky even for me. 
Sophie, I can explain. 
I hired Caroline to redo my apartment so it wouldn't be the dirty bachelor pad you were expecting. 
But you are the dirty bachelor that I'm expecting. 
And why would you hire Caroline? 
She doesn't know about sexy stuff. 
She couldn't even figure out what we do with the bowling ball. 
Sophie, you should've seen what was in here. 
I mean, he had this anatomically correct real doll he named Alexis. 
Yeah, well, she's very pretty. 
He had a sex swing. 
Ooh, a sex swing. 
What are you gonna tell me now? 
That he had a water bed? 
I did. 
It had 1,500 tracer bulbs. 
It was hot. 
Well, who has it now? 
I wanna be with him. 
Oh, hell, I'm tired of all this role-playing, so I'm just going to say it. 
Sophie, I am in love with you. 
Oh. 
Well, I haven't said this to a man in a very long time, but I like you a little bit. 
I don't know what she's talking about, Caroline. 
I think it's pretty. 
You make everything prettier, even the dumb diner. 
Your diner's not dumb. 
I miss the diner. 
And it misses you. 
You can have your job back. 
Is it just 'cause I'm stoned, or did anyone else feel that deep connection between them? 
Could you all leave? 
I wanna be alone with Oleg... 
And Alexis. 
Now are we going to smoke weed? 
Yeah, I'm dying to see you high. 
Well, as high as you can get. 
﻿1 Get the birthday candle ready, 'cause... 
Here comes Chestnut's carrot cake! 
I know we want this to be special, but Chestnut is a horse. 
Any day he's not being made into an Ikea meatball is a birthday. 
And remember, even though it's his tenth birthday, we have to pretend he's six or he'll be in a bad mood all week. 
Surprise! 
Happy Birthday, Chestnut! 
Max! He was supposed 
to do that! 
What? 
I know what he wished for. 
That one day, he and I live in a world where our love is recognized and we have the same rights as gay couples. 
There you go, baby. 
Hey, look, his shoe just fell off. 
Or maybe he kicked it off 'cause he's getting ready to par-tay. 
What are we gonna do? 
We don't have any money. 
I wanted a massage last week, so I just sat next to someone on the bus who looked like he'd touch me. 
I may have an idea how we can get 'em. 
A guy I picked up at Oktoberfest is a blacksmith. 
At least I think he was. 
I remember a leather apron and something being heated in a fire. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Well, I found my blacksmith. 
He now shares an artisan barn with a lady who makes clothing out of bees. 
I guess that's why our cupcake shop didn't work. 
We weren't providing a service that everyone needs. 
I looked at our boy, and not only does Chestnut need four new shoes, he has a hoof fungus. 
A hoof fungus? 
That's so ghetto. 
I'm pretty sure he got it from me because we shower together. 
And the cost of new shoes and vet fee? $1,400. 
Max, I feel awful. 
I'm a bad mother. 
You're not a bad mother. 
I know bad mothers. 
I came out of one. 
Ladies, what's happening over there? 
You know a gathering of more than two white people makes me nervous. 
Earl, one of them's Asian. 
Ah, same thing. 
Who would I talk to about the diner? 
We're interested in renting this location to film a TV show. 
We think your diner would be a great place to kill someone. 
I get it. 
'Cause every time I come in here, I die a little. 
Here's my card. 
Tom Woo, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. 
Shut your face, Tom Woo! 
I love all the Law & Orders, especially SVU. 
Their stories are ripped from the headlines, and I don't read the newspaper, so that's where I get all my news. 
Cool. 
Let me go get the director. 
That's him over there. 
Look how cute the director is. 
He's my rugged guy type. 
Not really rugged at all, but buys expensive, rugged-looking clothing from Saks 5th Avenue. 
Hi. 
DJ Kingsley. 
Nice beard. 
You grow out that stubble or just set your razor to "Jason Statham." 
Excuse me, sir. 
You've got a great face. 
Have you ever done any extra work? 
Well, I was in the 1973 classic Scream, Blackula, Scream. 
Pam Grier kicked me in the nuts and called me a "jive turkey." 
If you'd consider it, I'd love to have your look in the episode. 
Hey, what about me? 
You can shave my head, drag me behind a car, or anything else I've already done for free. 
Sure. And you must be 
an actress. 
You're way too pretty to just be a waitress. 
Thank you! 
In fact I have done a little acting. 
In high school, I portrayed Fantine in Les Miserables. 
Just hearing you say that makes me "miser-obble." 
Well, how about it? 
You wanna hang with me and be an extra on Special Victims Unit? 
It pays 112 a day plus whatever you normally make in tips. 
Oh, so about 115? 
I'm in. 
Mama needs a new pair of horseshoes. 
So where's the boss? 
I'm the boss, but I'll get the guy who owns the place. 
Oleg! 
They're shooting a TV show here, and the back of my head or the side of my boob is gonna be in it! 
Good for you, Max. 
I was on Ukraine's version of Big Brother once, better known as Just living in Ukraine. 
Han! Law and Order: 
Special Victims Unit wants to shoot in the diner, and if you don't say yes, you'll be my special victim when I cut your unit off. 
Please say yes, Han. 
They're gonna pay us to be in the background. 
But do you know how to act? 
Actually we do. 
My acting's method, whereas hers is more meth head. 
Hey, come in. 
And remember, if he says no, he doesn't mean it. 
He just wants you to flirt with him a little bit. 
Not so fast, Max. 
Hello, I'm Han Lee, the owner and proprietor. 
Oh, "proprietor." 
That's word's bigger than you are. 
What kinda compensation do you want? 
Whoa, whoa, my Asian brother. 
Slow down! 
Let's enjoy the dance. 
We'd like to shoot here. 
It's got the right amount of funk and skank. 
If we do real good in this and get a spin-off, that'll be the name of our show Funk and Skank. 
Okay, but I don't wanna be Skank. 
Oh, clearly I'm Skank. 
And may I say I'm honored I have such a worthy opponent to barter with. 
Dude, I'm from Pasadena. 
I can't believe this! 
I never thought I'd be in a TV show where no one was yelling, "You are not the father!" 
Let's go. 
Bring in the waitress extras. 
Ooh, I love these uniforms! 
I feel like Brenda from 90210 when she was dressed as that '50s waitress at the peach pit. 
Well, when we're the big stars of Funk and Skank, we won't have to wear any uniforms. 
But wait, aren't Funk and Skank cops? 
Uh, no, they're hookers. 
How about a compromise? 
Cops by day, prostitutes by night? 
You know, copstitutes. 
Either way, we're New York's finest. 
Okay, everybody, ready! 
Here we go. 
Look at Earl over there. 
Good luck, Earl! 
Camera on the door. 
Scene eight, take one. 
And action! 
Shooter comes in. 
And cut! Good! 
Reset. 
Earl, that was inspiring. 
I hope everyone who sees you goes out and ignores a crime. 
It was like that scene was about the cash register guy. 
You really brought something extra. 
I smell an Emmy. 
Oh, that's weed. 
Hi. Sorry we haven't gotten 
to you guys yet. 
Why don't you hang out in the office? 
I hear there's good Sushi. 
You look pretty. 
I think the director kinda likes me. 
Well, I don't know about him, but his penis does. 
Okay, camera on the door. 
Scene eight, take two. 
And action! 
Shooter comes in. 
Bang! Bang! 
Cut! 
Excuse me, how did you get through? 
Oh, please. 
I once got through the Berlin Wall. 
You think two kids with walkie-talkies can stop me? 
Damn, this room's got a sweet spread. 
Free Sushi? Uh-yes. 
Free dessert? Uh-duh. 
This is great. 
We've gotta figure out a way to get paid to sit around, eat free food, and do nothing more often. 
Oh, I think you cracked that code a long time ago. 
Would it be tacky if I packed some Sushi in my purse for later? 
Already packed mine, already packed yours. 
This is the VIP lounge. 
See? The shrimp 
have already been de-turded. 
Oh, hi, girls. 
You finally got new uniforms. 
You look stupid. 
These are actually from the costume department of a little show called Law & Order: SVU that Max and I are costarring in. 
Costars? Honey, please. 
You two are just extras. 
Um, extra paid and full of purse Sushi. 
 They're ready for you two. 
 Oh! Be right there. 
Just gonna put my purse in the fridge. 
Thomas. Tom. T-pain. 
Can we chat? 
What is it, dude? 
Your crew got soy sauce all over my computer. 
And according to our agreement, you must pay all the damages. 
 How much do you want? 
 $300. 
It's a piece of crap. 
But it was a gift from my father. 
And you know how important family is in our culture. 
Again, I don't. 
I was raised by two white women. 
Oh, hey, hey. 
Yes, uh, who do I talk to about becoming a star? 
This is so exciting! 
God! That woman keeps 
pushing my head down. 
I feel like I'm on a date with her. 
Okay, so you guys are here behind the counter, doing your waitress thing. 
Shooter aims for the cook but hits her, our featured waitress. 
Hey, didn't I already see you on SVU? 
Oh, yeah, I remember. 
They found your head in a mini fridge in the Hudson. 
I knew I recognized you. 
Wait, we've already killed you? 
Sorry, babe, you're out. 
Aw. 
Well, you gave great head. 
Tom, we gotta bump someone up to the featured waitress. 
Pays 1,000 more bucks. 
Max, that could be the extra money we need for Chestnut. 
Could one of us do it? 
Can either of you act like you've been hit with a bullet? 
Well, it just so happens I have been hit by a bullet twice once at a 7-Eleven and once running away in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven. 
So yeah, I think I got this. 
I'm thinking maybe a blonde would be better. 
Caroline? 
Well, I did have a pretty convincing death scene as Fantine, and I died like well, should I just show you? 
You are such a nerd. 
That's great, Caroline. 
Special effects, put the blood device on Caroline. 
She's our special victim. 
Really? I got it? 
Yes, but a little less "French Revolution," and a lot more "Face down on the floor." 
You can't take a shot. 
You can't even do a shot. 
Don't be mad, Max. 
I'm doing this for Chestnut. 
And it's not my fault he liked my death scene. 
He liked your death scene with his penis. 
Wow, Max, show business really brings out the worst in you. 
You haven't seen me at a wedding. 
Hello! 
You just put your hand down a woman's blouse without asking? 
Every day. 
Well, here. 
Can I help you? 
No, it's a union thing. 
Aren't you in there a little long? 
Yeah. Let me just 
Caroline, that special effects rig you're wearing is very sensitive, so don't let anything near your chest. 
Except me. 
And don't be nervous. 
The camera's gonna love you. 
How could it not? 
DJ, stop flirting with me. 
I'm gonna die soon and you'll never get over me. 
Promise you'll die soon? 
Max, I'm about to be shot, and I can't die with bad blood between us. 
We're good. 
You're living my dream, girl. 
 Do me proud. 
 I will. 
No! Don't hug with it! 
Caroline, you set the thing off. 
We weren't rolling. 
Really? That's too bad, 
because that was gold. 
That's a wrap, everybody. 
We'll pick it up tomorrow. 
I'm so sorry. 
It just went off. 
Prettiest screw-up all day. 
After you get cleaned up, why don't we have dinner at my hotel? 
Dinner? 
Yeah, I'd like that. 
Let's say 8:00. 
My assistant will give you the address and my room number. 
You know, this is exactly how you look in all my dreams where I shoot you. 
The director just invited me to dinner at his hotel, but it's in his room. 
 Do you think he  Yes. 
 Is that why he  Yes. 
 Will you come with? 
 Yes. 
Maybe you're wrong. 
Maybe he thought my audition was really No. 
Caroline, next time, maybe a little less. 
Now, remember. 
This director slips you anything that looks like a sweet tart, it's probably that date rape drug that knocks you out and distorts your memory. 
Or at least that's what it does to the guys I give it to. 
It's never gonna get to that. 
I have my own date rape drug. 
I talk about myself incessantly till guys get bored and pass out. 
So if that doesn't work, what are your limits? 
A little over the sweater, under sweater, a little front door, back door, a little secret staircase? 
I don't know what that is, but no one goes up my staircase, not even for Chestnut. 
At the most, I'll do kissing. 
You are thinking like an extra. 
You need to think like a star if you're gonna buy Chestnut shoes, then therapy, then a way out of scientology. 
Oh, hi. 
You brought company. 
Yes, she's my ride. 
We share a subway card. 
Well, she uses the card. 
I jump the turnstile and she pretends to chase me, yelling "Don't worry, I'll get her!" 
Well, come on in. 
Stay for a glass of champagne, Max. 
Oh, and don't worry about taking the subway home alone. 
My driver can take you. 
Now I'm torn. 
Because as much as I don't want you to have sex against your will, I do wanna roll up to the McDonald's in a limo. 
There's no rush. 
Come on, let's sit down and hang out. 
It was really nice of you to invite me up here to have a casual, work-related dinner. 
Max there, Caroline there, and me, well, here. 
Can't turn it off, still directing. 
Oh! You know, 
I love this hotel. 
I came here once to do a photo shoot for a "20 under 20: Teen millionaires to watch" spread, and I remember I had just gotten my haircut, which was a big decision, 'cause I was kinda known for my long hair. 
And he wanted to take an inch off, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you're known for your long hair... 
People are expecting to see you with long hair. 
So was that okay? 
Oh! 
Yeah, sure. 
It--it's just Max is here, and I don't want her to feel left out. 
Sorry. 
Got it. 
That was nice. 
You're a good kisser. 
Are you eating a cinnamon altoid? 
I'm eating a cinnamon altoid. 
Well, then I just tasted you. 
Look, DJ, I think you have the wrong idea. 
Oh! 
Hold that thought. 
I would never interrupt this for a work call, but it's my wife and I wanna say "good night" to the kids. 
That guy's a player. 
I'm not talking my way out of this one. 
We're screwed. 
Yeah! 
He's got a high tolerance. 
Your long-hair speech almost roofied me. 
What do we do, Max? 
I don't want to offend him. 
We need that extra money for Chestnut. 
This is the oldest tale in the book a woman forced to trade her body to get her child shoes. 
It's Shakespearian, it's Dickensian, it's Kardashian. 
Look at the bright side. 
You already thought he was sexy, so you were probably gonna sleep with him eventually. 
And now that he's married, you know he won't cheat on you with somebody else because you're that somebody else. 
You a side bitch! 
No, Max, I can just tell him how I feel. 
Besides, he probably already got it. 
You heard me tell him he read the signs wrong. 
Apparently the sign he read said "Three-way up ahead." 
Pretty good, right? 
Hit show, wife, kids. 
Still find time to get to the gym. 
So you guys need to drink a little more before we do this? 
'Cause I don't. 
All right, I'm just gonna say this before that towel comes off. 
I think you've misread the signals here. 
Really! 
That sucks. 
I'm sorry. 
These things happen. 
It reminds me of that time I had tea with that prince in Dubai and he thought he bought me. 
Turns out he bought a different blonde. 
Oh, men! 
 Good morning, DJ. 
 Morning! 
See, Max? 
No hard feelings. 
I told you it was gonna work out. 
Hi! I'm ready 
for my fake blood pouch. 
Um, I think you got the wrong breasts. 
But for a rough guy, you got a soft touch. 
Yup. 
There's been a change. 
Uh, Max is now getting featured, and you're in the B.G. 
Background. 
 These are real? 
 Yep. 
Nice job. 
You hear that, Max? 
Now I'm in the B.G. 
I didn't do DJ, so I'm in the B.G. 
Max! 
We have time for one full take before lunch, then we'll come back and do the rest of your coverage after. 
Hey, maybe you and I could have a little lunch together in my trailer. 
Well, I do love a trailer. 
Okay, let's stay on schedule, people. 
My kid's reading a poem at school. 
By the way, your rack looks fantastic. 
You seem like a great dad. 
DJ, is this about last night, 'cause I wouldn't wear a towel? 
No. 
No, we're good. 
I don't wanna see that. 
Bury her deep. 
"Bury her deep"? 
Did he just say, "Bury her deep"? 
Caroline, you need to work back there. 
Is this how Hollywood treats women? 
This is how Hollywood treats everyone. 
Everybody ready. 
Max, if you do this, you'll be getting paid for sex. 
Well, it's about time. 
Places, everyone. 
You don't have to do this. 
Chestnut is my horse. 
And action! 
Max, you're wiping the counter. 
The killer comes in. 
You look up. 
Don't do it. 
We can find money somewhere else. 
Cut! 
Tom, I don't wanna see her. 
 Caroline. 
 Here they come. 
Come on, everybody. 
Back to one. 
And action! 
Max, you're wiping the counter. 
The killer comes in. 
You look up. 
Pick up! 
Max, seriously, it's not worth it. 
Cut! 
Get her out of there. 
Reset, reset. 
Sorry about all that, people. 
Now, let's give me the bullet I've been waiting for my whole life. 
I haven't felt this unwanted since I tried to teach those inner-city school kids how to knit. 
Seriously Caroline, you have to stay here, away from the shot, or neither of you is gonna be paid. 
Hey, Tom, you know what this scene needs? 
A little more cashier. 
Oy, that crew is doing a lot of damage to this diner. 
Well, I'm doing some damage to this fancy French water. 
150 for the floor, 20 for the napkins they used, and... 
And 55 bucks for that gorgeous picture of the city. 
This is ridiculous. 
How much longer do I have to wait to be discovered? 
Do what every other American would do skip the hard work and put out a sex tape. 
No, I'm gonna go out there. 
Where's my lipstick? 
Here, hold my Shake Weight. 
And my Fresca. 
Oh, hi. 
Who do I talk to about getting a part in this thing? 
I mean, I already let the guy who puts out the cookies touch my boobs. 
We don't have a guy who puts out cookies. 
Yo. 
Okay, everybody ready! 
Camera up! 
Oh, he looks important. 
 Oh, no, no! Stop, stop! 
 No! Let go! 
 Ooh! 
 Not the blood switch! 
Ahhh! 
Someone shot Max! 
Cut! 
Tom, get rid of Max too. 
Get me another girl. 
Typical! 
Shoot on my chest and you're done with me. 
Hi, you looking for a new girl? 
Last time I looked like this, I was coming out of an acid trip and my friend Daniel was missing. 
I gotta admit, getting shot felt kinda gangsta waitress. 
I'm like Notorious BLT. 
So here's the deal. 
We'll pay you for the day yesterday, but not for today or for the featured extra. 
 Say what? 
 Not so fast, my brother. 
Here is the latest tally for my diner damage. 
What's this last $1,000 charge? 
That is for the damage done to Max and Caroline. 
According to crew scuttlebutt, the director tried some funny business last night. 
This is not cool, dude. 
It is most decidedly not cool, pal. 
So maybe there is someone in a union I can talk to about this particular damage. 
Not to mention the child labor laws you violated by working with Han. 
Don't talk to anyone. 
I'll get 'em paid. 
This sucks. 
I knew we should've shot at a Denny's. 
Han, that is the sweetest, coolest thing you just did for us. 
It is, and Caroline is totally gonna put out for you tonight. 
That's kind of her thing now. 
Well, I don't want anyone to take advantage of you two. 
You're my girls. 
And tonight, on a very special episode of Funk and Skank, the cute, tiny Asian guy turns out to be the girls' pimp, and the copstitutes are able to buy new horseshoes. 
﻿1 I can't believe Han is making us tidy up this damn diner. 
It's like putting a pretty church hat on a whore. 
Come on, harder, faster! 
Do it faster and harder. 
Ding! What is, "Things Han 
says to a male hustler," Alex. 
No time for jokes, Max. 
The health inspector will be here soon, and I need to get that "A" rating. 
This diner getting an "A" for cleanliness would be like me getting an "A" for a bra size. 
Oh, it will happen. 
I did a thorough job. 
Is he making omelets or crystal meth? 
Oleg, you let Han put you in two hair nets? 
Three. 
I don't want to talk about it. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Sorry I'm late. 
I was having my nails done. 
It's the first time I stopped moving in two years, and I fell asleep. 
You had money to get your nails done? 
Was prostitution as disgusting as you thought it would be? 
Han paid for it. 
Oh, so it was worse. 
There she is. 
There's my show pony. 
Let me see them digits. 
I want you to be the first thing the health inspector sees when he enters. 
You're just so blonde and clean. 
Hey! Where's my manicure? 
How come I don't get anything? 
Oh, I haven't forgotten you. 
Here's 50 bucks. 
Beat it until the inspector leaves. 
Some would be insulted. 
I'm gonna ask for $75. 
And, you are going to get it. 
I have exciting news. 
At the nail salon, I heard about this amazing seminar we should go to. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
I went to a seminar once. 
I was almost married to 300 Koreans. 
It's a branding seminar for business owners to define who they are and get them primed and ready for their window of opportunity. 
I think I'd rather be married to 300 Koreans. 
Then I could get my nails done whenever I wanted. 
Max, this is the real deal. 
The woman who runs it is a branding genius. 
She created the Nike "Just Do It." 
Oh, that woman didn't make up "just do it." 
high school boyfriends have been using that for centuries. 
You're still here! 
What's it gonna take, another $10? 
Hey, I don't need a seminar. 
I found a brand that's gonna get me rich--obnoxious! 
Okay, Earl, how is cleaning your area coming along? 
I've got decades of napkins over here with all my old ideas on them. 
Apparently, napkins were the old Twitter. 
Hello. 
Could you tell the owner the health inspector has arrived? 
Oh, you are a woman. 
Thank you for noticing. 
Are you Han Lee? 
Hey, Han, is this the So where would you like to start? 
Sadly, the men's room. 
Ground zero. 
I will join you in a second. 
Is it Miss or Mrs. Rotello? 
It's Miss. 
Thank you for asking. 
I'll see you at the toilets. 
Ground zero just got a lot nicer. 
Han, I think that health inspector wants to inspect you. 
Stop! If she hears you, 
she'll give me an "F." 
I think she wants you to give her an "F." 
Max, I paid you $90. 
Now, go! 
 Here, Max. 
 What's this? 
That's how we'll make the $600 we need for the seminar. 
I made flyers for a yard sale at Kinko's. 
Wow, Kinko's" and "yard sale" in the same breath. 
Where do I keep finding this inner strength? 
That must be Sophie with her yard sale stuff. 
Hi, girls! 
Hey, Sophie! 
Where's all your junk? 
Oh, where it always is In my trunk! 
Well, look here. 
I got a bunch of stuff that Oleg wanted to donate to your yard sale. 
Aw, that's so nice of him. 
Oh, yeah, he doesn't know about it. 
Yeah, it's all the stuff he's been leaving around my apartment. 
He's getting way too comfortable, so... 
Sell it all! 
Yeah. 
You probably can get a couple of bucks for his passport. 
Yeah, he paid $80 for it. 
Maybe he's leaving things around because he wants to take things to another level, maybe even move in. 
Oh, girl talk. 
Ooh! 
Shouldn't you serve me a cosmo like they do on television? 
Don't have any cosmos, as we're broke and it's not 1998, but... 
How about a pink cupcake? 
Oh, even better. 
Maybe now that Oleg has told you he loves you, you're starting to have intimacy issues about getting close. 
Oh, come on. 
Save that garbage for your yard sale. 
Yeah, the man is just up there too much. 
I mean, he's down there when he's up there, but, yeah... 
It's way too much, yeah. 
He's got to change, or he's out. 
Hey, thanks for the cupcake, Max. 
And, Caroline... 
I don't know what you add, but, yeah. 
Our yard sale is not quite all set up yet. 
You're early. 
Our flyer said 1:00 to 5:00. 
Oh, I don't do flyers. 
Miss Trudy, my card. 
This is my wife, Miss Trudy, and the bird's name is Scott. 
Dennis Endicott The Third, thrift shop scout and Brooklyn's crazy kitsch genius. 
"Lord of The Things." 
So, I have lots of classic couture pieces. 
You won't be disappointed. 
Well, I have been before. 
Miss Trudy? 
We went all the way to Pennsylvania for a Facts of Life bean bag toss game. 
 No Blair! 
 No Blair. 
Just two tooties. 
Life just sucks it hard sometimes. 
Am I right, Scott? 
So, on that chair are my things, and you'll notice that there's a lot Oh, I already did. 
14 for all of it. 
$1,400, perfect! 
Hundred? 
Darling, $14. 
But this is all vintage. 
Vintage, or just out of season? 
Wait, is that a Nugget Buddy? 
Miss Trudy, they have the cowboy. 
He loves the cowboy. 
I bet he does. 
Oh, I am so relieved. 
When we don't find anything good, he gets really mad... 
At me. 
I'm sorry, that's not supposed to be out. 
I can't break up the set. 
You have all ten Nugget Buddies? 
Yep, and every other Happy Meal toy since 1993. 
My mom used to take me there a lot. 
Well, she used to leave me there a lot, but same diff. 
$600 for the whole collection. 
 Sold! 
 Whoa, whoa, not sold. 
Max, come on, this is our future. 
Well, those are my past. 
No sale. 
Let's go, Scott. 
This is "tootie-gate" all over again. 
And you when we get home, you better put on the punishment pillow. 
Don't worry. 
I kind of like it. 
Well, so much for a horse in a hat being the weirdest thing in this yard. 
Explain to me again how an item I paid $3,000 for just two years ago is worth less than something that came with a dipping sauce! 
A Happy Meal toy reminds people of a sweeter time, a simpler time, a pre-Kardashian time. 
Attention, attention! 
I have something very important here. 
The results of your DNA test proving your mother was Asian and your father was a pine nut? 
No, we got our letter grade from the city health inspector's office. 
Whoo! 
We got a "B"! 
That's the first "B" I ever got I didn't have to French kiss for. 
A "B"? 
No, no, no, no! 
This boy don't play with no Bs. 
I'm calling that little tease, Miss Jean Rotello, right now. 
This isn't good. 
Asians don't do well with Bs. 
At Wharton, I got a "B," and the Japanese kid who sat next to me killed himself. 
Oleg, I'm kind of getting used to this look now. 
You kind of look like Bin Laden's ghost. 
Good night, girls. 
I'm going to go over and spend the night at Sophie's. 
No, maybe not. 
Why would you say that? 
Because she can't stop herself. 
It's just, she might like a little space sometimes. 
She needs space? 
Did she say that? 
 Not in so many words. 
 No, those were the words. 
Look, Sophie loves having you around. 
It's just, she told us that you're getting a little too comfortable there when she came over to sell all your stuff at our yard sale. 
 I know how that sounds  And yet, you keep going. 
Oleg, Sophie is just feeling a little smothered. 
She feels smothered? 
Have you ever tried motorboating those cans of hers? 
Once, but I was very drunk at the time. 
Just make a few changes, and everything will be right back on track. 
And stop talking now. 
Make some changes? 
That's all I've done for her. 
I changed my furniture, I changed my ways. 
I changed my underwear more than once a week. 
That's it. 
No more changing for Han... 
And no more changing for Sophie. 
I'm done changing. 
I'm back, baby. 
Spread the word! 
I think he's gonna be spreading more than the word. 
I want to kill someone! 
Why, did they cancel Suite Life of Zack and Cody? 
No, I just got off the phone with the restaurant inspector She answered her phone at this time of night? 
Come on, it's not like she was out on the town. 
Han! 
I think that "B" you're holding might stand for "Bitch." 
And she told me I got a "B" because of the conditions of the back room off the dishwasher area. 
I didn't even know we had a back room, did you? 
No, but of course there's a mysterious back room in this new upside down world, where a piece of cheese is mayor and Donna Karan is a no one! 
Oh, there it is. 
I always thought that was the property of the bar next door. 
If we share a door with a bar, my breaks are about to get longer and drunker. 
Wait here, girls, while I push this rack away. 
P90X, don't fail me now! 
I'm pretty sure this is what my soul looks like. 
Now I'm going to have to hire an emergency crew to come clean this by Friday to get my "A." 
Oh, damn it. 
I guess Caroline and I can do it. 
Are you insane? 
Max, I can't. 
I haven't worked on the railroads like you. 
Come on. 
Han needs his "A," and we need the money for that seminar. 
Isn't this one of those "windows of opportunity"? 
 $600. 
 Forget it, girls. 
Look at these walls. 
I need professional steam cleaners. 
I have steam cleaned before. 
I mean, how else do you get malt liquor and blood stains out of a rented prom dress? 
Ugh, it's so humid and damp in here. 
Now I know how balls feel. 
Let me just move this cord out of Oh! I just got a shock! 
No. 
A shock is coming home to find your mom in the tub with your tenth-grade crush. 
I should push these light cords back up over Uh, it's a roach nest. 
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay! 
It's okay! 
Good news, they're already dead. 
Bad news, as I pull them out of your hair, they're decomposing. 
Are you crying? 
I can't do this. 
Not even for the seminar. 
I'll sell my Happy Meals. 
Max, you don't have to do that. 
 But we need the money. 
 Okay, great. 
Hey, Nugget Buddies. 
As soon as the man with the bird gets here, you'll be leaving my loving care and going out into the big, bad world. 
Shoes will step on you, kids will tie you to firecrackers, and some real sickos may stick you in a trunk and drive you across state lines. 
Hi, Sophie. 
Oleg cheated on me, and I'm so  maaad! 
Oh, I have to break things! 
But everything upstairs in my apartment is too nice! 
So... Run a tab, girls! 
Aah! 
I gotta break more things! 
Wait, don't break that box! 
That's my Happy Ohh. 
I feel better. 
I really do. 
Okay. 
All right. 
I think we just saw what it would look like if someone cheated on The Incredible Hulk. 
Hey, girls. 
Sophie's back. 
Spread the word! 
Max, look, your Happy Meal toys. 
Look, I know you're upset about your toys, Max, but come on, it's kind of fun. 
There is only one kind of wet that I have been at 3:00 in the morning that I would call "fun." 
This is not it! 
Oh, look! 
Under the newspaper, there's some sort of stained glass window there. 
Aw, pretty! 
Oh, you're finally getting the money you wanted and you're so chipper. 
I'm "chipper," to use your word, because we're working to earn money to move our business brand forward. 
Stop saying "brand." 
And this "seminar" better be worth it. 
Why are you saying it like that? 
"Seminar," with quotes around it, like it's a silly idea or something. 
I didn't say "seminar" with quotes around it. 
You did. 
You said Ooh! Ooh, sorry! 
Sorry! 
I was trying to illustrate that you put quotes around it. 
I am too tired to put quotes around things, but if I were gonna put quotes on a word, that word would be, "seminar"! 
Oh, and "branding"! 
And I would put big, giant, dumbass quotes around "branding seminar"! 
Max, you did that on purpose! 
Oh, maybe it was just an accident! 
Stop! Stop! 
You're spraying the light cord! 
Hello! 
Water and electricity, not the best combo! 
Like some other not-great combos I can think of. 
Us? 
You mean us? 
What, now we are not a great combo? 
Oh, wow. 
Sorry I suggested we go to a quote-seminar-unquote. 
Sorry I'm trying to move us forward. 
Sorry that you think you know how to do everything. 
Sorry that you resent the fact that I know how to do business. 
Sorry that you think you know how to do business, and maybe that's why our first business failed. 
Sorry that you took two weed breaks every single day instead of making work calls, and maybe that's why our business failed. 
Sorry that I didn't take more weed breaks, because I really could have used them working with a know-it-all like you! 
 And sorry  It's my turn! 
No! Sorry that you, also, 
had to stick your nose into Oleg and Sophie's business, so that he cheated, and she got mad and then, by an almost irrefutable line of direct action, you killed my toys! 
Sorry that it doesn't matter how many things I ever did right because poor itty-bitty baby Max's Happy Meal toys got all broked! 
Don't push me, Max! 
You're such a fan of branding, "Just Do It." 
"Have it your way." 
"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." 
"Got Milk?" 
Got any other stupid business ideas? 
Stop! 
Stop, stop, stop it, stop it! 
I am done! 
No, I'm done! 
No, we're both done! 
Fine, we're both done! 
 Done! 
 Done! 
No, I'm really done, Max! 
I'm tired of trying to make things happen! 
I'm tired of pushing us into cupcake shops! 
And I'm tired of you pushing us into cupcake shops too. 
Shops that we couldn't afford in the first place. 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God, Max! 
Max, are you all right? 
CPR, what is it? 
Do you do pinch the nose and breathe into the mouth? 
Wait, wait! 
I think you're supposed to pump the chest first. 
Well, I'll never get through those! 
Max, I'm about to put my mouth on yours, so if you're kidding you better wake up right now. 
Max, please don't die. 
Please don't die. 
You're my best friend. 
Sit up! 
Sit up, sit up! 
 Are you all right? 
 What happened? 
You grabbed that wire, and I think you got a little electrocuted. 
I always knew I'd be electrocuted, I just thought it would be in the chair. 
God, I'm so hot. 
I need air. 
Come here. 
The window, come on. 
Come on. 
Come on, over here. 
Here, kneel. 
Open! 
Oh, damn, there are shutters. 
Here, hold on to the wall while I get this. 
Are you okay? 
Take a deep breath in. 
Breathe in. 
Max, that was so scary. 
For a second, I thought you died. 
Maybe I did, 'cause I kind of remember a place with flames. 
And you were making out with me. 
What is that delicious smell? 
The pizza place next to the bar next door. 
Oh, God, has a pizza ever smelled so good? 
Hey, what are you guys doing? 
Is that, like, a store or something? 
 No. 
 Holler. 
Wait, Caroline... 
This is our window of opportunity! 
Max, what a great idea! 
A cupcake walk-up window? 
You're a genius! 
I just might be since I died! 
So much less overhead. 
And this time we'll be starting at the bottom, so we'll have nowhere to go but up. 
Thank God! 
I am so much more comfortable at the bottom! 
Hey, I have this weird feeling inside. 
I'm McHappy. 
Hey, girls. 
Turning tricks in a window like they do in Amsterdam? 
No, we think we found our new business. 
Sophie, this is the new Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
Speaking of windows, that's Oleg's car, right? 
Oh. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Well, some people open windows, some people smash them. 
﻿1 Earl, time to play "Marry, Sleep with, or Kill: Diner edition." 
Ladies, booth one? 
Sleep with, sleep with, slept with. 
Nice. 
Okay, Max, the dude at table ten. 
Is there a "Throw food in the cage and run" category? 
Hey, jump in. 
We're playing "Marry, Sleep with, or Kill:" Diner edition." 
No, if I slept with anyone in this diner, I'd kill myself. 
Even in a fictional scenario, I cannot permit myself to go there. 
Girl, you'd take the fun out of the punch bowl full of cocaine. 
Okay, fine. 
Sleep with Earl, marry you. 
Not us! 
Jeez. 
What are you, a freak? 
I feel uncomfortable, Caroline. 
Like, I don't know how to look at you anymore. 
Now, I can only see you in a creepy lady tux. 
You said it was just a game! 
I'm not in love with you. 
Back off! 
It was just a joke, Earl. 
The things we say in jest, darling. 
The things we say in jest. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Oh, my God, look at the RSVP list for our opening party. 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes is at capacity. 
Hey, we might even be overbooked, because in my experience, even when guys say they're not going to come, they do. 
Caroline, booth two has been waiting for service for ten minutes! 
And Han knows how frustrating that is, 'cause he's been waiting to be serviced for years. 
Not that it's any of your business, Max, but I have a very active sex life. 
So then, Han, will you be bringing a date tomorrow night? 
Ah, no. 
You do understand that sex involves two people, right? 
And that one of those people has to be you? 
What is all this dirty talk? 
This is a diner, not a dirty talking place. 
Sorry, Han, I know we still work here at night. 
I'll go right over to the booth. 
We were just talking about our big opening party. 
All you ever talk about is your big opening. 
Now who has the potty mouth? 
Max, I need your guest list names. 
Oh, okay, I'm still waiting for them to confirm, so just put me down for ten. 
Okay, but I need their names asap. 
I'm running a tight door. 
I got a bouncer from a local club to donate his time. 
I told him it was a charity event for eczema. 
What? We'll make a big donation 
when we're successful, but, for tomorrow, every now and then, scratch a little? 
Hi, everybody! 
I got great news. 
What? You finally found 
the thing we lost in there? 
No. I knew we should've 
tied a string on it. 
No, look. 
I got a fax from Poland. 
My dream house is done! 
Isn't it amazing? 
It is amazing. 
I haven't seen a fax in, like, five years. 
Sophie, it's so pretty! 
Look at all this sweet gingerbread woodwork on the porch. 
Oh, I'm so excited. 
I'm going to be on Air Poland flight right after big party. 
You are going to Poland? 
That's news. 
And when were you going to tell me? 
Um, now, yeah. 
Um, I'm going to be gone for a month. 
Oh, okay. 
It will be good to have some time away from the old ball and chain. 
Yeah, he's not talking about me. 
We use a ball and chain in our lovemaking. 
That's the thing I can't find. 
All right. 
Okay, yeah. 
Well, buh-bye. 
I'll see you tomorrow night at my big going away party! 
Sophie, the party's for our cupcake business. 
Oh, see, this is why I don't like you so much. 
Guys, thanks again for donating your time. 
It's fundraisers like this that will help put an end to undescended testicles. 
Hi! 
I'd like to meet the owner of this awesome and totally cool cupcake shop? 
Oh, nevermind! 
That's me. 
Max, you got a blow-out! 
Yeah, I'd figured I finally see what all the fuss about getting blown is. 
Oh, hi, we're not quite ready for guests yet. 
Girl, I'm your doorman, Nevel. 
Oh, I'm confused. 
I thought my doorman was Straight, white, and boring? 
He was. 
Then, boring came down with the flu. 
Now, you've got gay, black, and definitely not boring. 
So what's the charity tonight? 
 Eczema. 
 Undescended testicles. 
People with eczema and undescended testicles. 
Lord, child. 
That is a cross to bear. 
Get me the door list, and let's make those poor, itchy boys some money. 
Another fake charity? 
You've got some balls, even if they aren't descended. 
Max, we so lucked out. 
Nothing says "successful party" like a bitchy, gay doorman! 
Give me your guest names. 
I'll write them down. 
Okay, fine. 
Put down Tommy, Dylan, Robbie, Johnny Robbie and Johnny? 
Wait, Max, are these all your ex-boyfriends? 
Perhaps. 
Max, the invited guests were all supposed to be business contacts. 
See, this is why I didn't tell you sooner. 
You're a control freak. 
And for the record, these guys have all had contact with my business. 
You're using our launch party to get back at ex-boyfriends? 
Uh, yeah! 
That's what success is for, to say "suck it" to people who dumped you. 
"See my blown-out hair? 
Suck it! 
"See my cool cupcake shop? 
Suck it! 
See these in this blouse? 
You wish you could suck it." 
And here, it is not just boyfriends on my list. 
I also invited the lady from Staples who gives me attitude. 
She can suck it too. 
Fine, but how is inviting Johnny and his new wife a victory? 
Oh, like this. 
"Hi, Mrs. Johnny. 
Nice to meet you." 
You got him, but I got these "And all this, so suck it." 
I'm not so sure this is healthy. 
Are you kidding me? 
This is the healthiest thing I've done in my life. 
I even thought about inviting my mother to come and suck it, but then she'd realize maybe I didn't commit suicide two years ago like my note said. 
I'm about ready to open. 
Shouldn't we be putting up some testicle banners, or scrotum posters, or something? 
Also, there's a cute blonde boy out here asking for you that I'm about to eat alive. 
That's Andy with the free bar stuff. 
Go, I'm gonna stay here and practice my "suck it" face for a while. 
How's this? 
That look is so much more "suck it" with the straight hair. 
I know, right? 
 There's my cute boyfriend. 
 Hey. 
How did everything go at Spike's Liquor? 
Well, I got a little bit confused about what charity we're pretending to help, so I told them my sister's homeless and my balls are up inside me. 
Now, we just gotta hope Spike's not the chatty type. 
Oh! They just dropped. 
Hey, Andy, question. 
What does this face say to you? 
I don't know, like, "I'm cool." 
So close! 
Guess again. 
Okay, like, "I'm better than you." 
No, like, "I'm it, and you can suck it." 
Yes! Yes! 
They can suck it! 
Is that what you're wearing tonight? 
Yeah. 
No? 
A sweater? 
I always saw you in a suit tonight. 
Run home real quick and put on a suit. 
Hurry, people are starting to come. 
Uh, Max is still making the face. 
I know. 
I can't stop. 
I've waited my whole life to make this face. 
Max, look. 
Our business is open. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Not quite. 
In five, four, three, two. 
Both: Whoo! 
 Name, please? 
 Sophie Kuchenski. 
Guest of honor. 
 How many in your party? 
 See, I knew it was my party! 
Max, there's a line all the way down the hall and I've given out, like, a hundred business cards! 
You know what that means? 
Being poor can suck it! 
Girl, the Fire Marshal just dropped by, and told me we can't let anymore people in till some of these folks go out. 
Nevel, none of my guests are even here yet. 
It is very important to let in any guy who looks hot, but you know would screw you over. 
Is there any other type? 
I'll go get some more cupcakes. 
Hey! 
How's it going so far, babe? 
Andy, what are you doing? 
I told you to come back in a suit. 
Yeah, I know, but I like what I'm wearing. 
So you're telling me you'll just go and do what you want, no matter how much I try to control you? 
Yeah. 
That is so freaking hot. 
Caroline! 
Caroline, I can't get in! 
Caroline! Less kissing, 
more noticing me! 
See, I know her, and my name's on the list. 
Han Lee. 
Honey, if I was a fat girl, and your name was Sara Lee, you still wouldn't be getting in. 
We are at capacity! 
Hey, Robbie. 
On the list. 
Go right on in, child. 
Uh, hello? 
Do you need a dictionary to define the word "capacity?" 
I have clear orders: Only very hot men who look like trouble. 
Mm-hmm. 
Excuse me, you know where I can find Max? 
 Yes, she's in the back. 
 Cool. 
Robbie, it's me, Caroline. 
Oh, sorry. 
Did we have sex? 
What? No! 
I'm Max's roommate. 
Oh, Max had a roommate? 
I was pretty much wasted the whole time. 
I remember, like, nothing, but I'm in the program now, so it's one day at a time. 
 Well, Max is through there. 
  Cool. 
But we did have sex, right? 
No! 
We did not have sex. 
You offered, but I wasn't into you. 
Yeah, right. 
 Hey, Max. 
 Robbie! 
Why are you making that face? 
You have a toothache or something? 
No, it's I'm successful now and this is my shop. 
Wow. Cool. 
So listen, I'm an alcoholic now, and I did a lot of stuff that wasn't cool, and I came here because the program says that I have to make almonds. 
"Almonds"? 
You mean "amends"? 
Cool. So, look, 
I cheated on you behind your back, like, every day. 
Well, um, we don't have to go into all this now. 
It's kind of a big night for me. 
And I stole money from you too, like, every time we had sex. 
But we had a lot of sex. 
I know. 
Well, I stole a lot of money. 
Well, this just went from "suck it" to "it sucks," so lift up your shirt. 
I gotta get something out of tonight. 
Money well spent. 
Just found out I paid for more sex than an Arab businessman. 
Maybe this wasn't the healthiest thing I could've done tonight. 
So what do you wanna do? 
Should I tell Nevel to keep Johnny out? 
Too late. 
Way too late. 
Max. 
Hi. 
You look even better than I remember. 
Well, I should. 
I just got blown. 
Suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it. 
Max, this place is so awesome. 
It's like you're telling everybody who ever doubted you to suck it. 
No, we're not petty like that. 
Hey, it's a little loud in here. 
You wanna talk in the hall? 
Uh, wait, let me take a look around my big, successful shop. 
Yeah, I can go. 
Keep your eye on Max. 
That guy in the Brad Pitt glasses broke her heart, and I don't trust him. 
Max, you look insanely good. 
Thanks. 
Now, maybe you could repeat that to your wife, and where is she? 
We never got married. 
Max! Max! 
I can't get in! 
Wait, what do you mean you didn't get married? 
Johnny! 
Hey, Johnny, I'm back here! 
I didn't know if I was gonna tell you, but then I got your invite Max! Johnny! 
I'm back here! 
Should we just go say "hi"? 
Uh, no, not right now. 
Max! Max! 
I can't get in! 
Max! Johnny! 
Max, I've been thinking about you a lot. 
Stop. Before you 
say anything else, I just have to say I need candy. 
 All right, what were you saying? 
I called off the wedding because she wasn't the one, and you wanna know how I know that? 
Max! Johnny! 
I can't get into the party! 
Come here. 
Help me out! 
Seriously! 
That doorman is a biatch! 
Okay, so, uh Wait, what are we doing? 
Making out in a room full of candy. 
Right. 
No, no, this can't happen. 
I was gonna give you my "suck it" face. 
Okay, give it to me. 
I deserve it. 
Your "suck it" face is hot. 
It's the hair. 
Ow! 
    Greatest night of my life! 
Disclaimer: This is not my T-shirt, though I am all about the Girl Power. 
Disclaimer: It's not my T-shirt either. 
Some nerd left it in the dryer at the laundromat. 
It's mine. 
Girl Power! 
No way. 
No way! 
Do I smell chocolate chips? 
And is Uncle Andy making pancakes? 
You do, and I am. 
Dude, I don't know you, but chocolate chip pancakes are the balls. 
How did you two sleep? 
Did we sleep? 
Great! So what's 
gonna happen now? 
I meant today, at the shop, our big first day in business! 
You thought I was talking about you two? 
Plbbt! I don't care 
about you two. 
Plbbt! Nobody cares 
about you two. 
Well, first, we have to clean the party mess up. 
Andy and I did it last night when you didn't come back. 
Um, can someone here mellow out and put some pancakes in her pancake hole? 
No, Caroline, I get it. 
It's been a rocky ride for Max and me. 
See, when we met, I had a girlfriend. 
Which he never told her about, and And keep eating. 
And because of that, Max and I never really got together, and then that girl and I broke up, and by the time I saw Max again, I was Engaged to be married? 
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna get married. 
Wait, to that same girlfriend? 
Different one. 
Different one. 
Yeah, but that didn't work out either, and I've had a couple girlfriends since Oh! Only a couple! 
Yeah, none of them seemed to work out. 
None of them are Max. 
Hey, save me a pancake. 
It looks like Caroline has plans to eat them all. 
Well, Max, as far as the "suck it" plan goes, it looks like somebody sucked something. 
Pancakes, pancake hole. 
He's a good guy. 
Yeah, he seems cool. 
Kinda falls in love a lot, but hey... 
And I did not tell him to say that. 
He never does what I say. 
It's hot. 
"But hey" what? 
Oh, we're continuing? 
Um, I don't know. 
Maybe I'm partial, but Max, you're an "A." 
He kind of seems like a "B." 
Minus. 
First of all, look at me. 
I am clearly a "D," and I don't think he falls in love a lot. 
Man, I love, love, love pancakes. 
If I could, I would marry a pancake. 
What time is it? 
10:20. 
Well, it's the first day open. 
All those people are probably tired from the party. 
Yeah. 
Oh, and look! 
We forgot to light it up. 
People don't know we're open. 
In five, four, three, two. 
Both: Whoo! 
 Go to work. 
   First day! 
 Yep. 
No one's here. 
Remember: All we have to sell is 70 cupcakes a day to keep on track. 
70 cupcakes? 
That's not so hard. 
Maybe we should do the light again. 
In five, four, three, two. 
Both: Whoo! 
What time is it now? 
Tomorrow, we only need to sell 140 cupcakes. 
140 cupcakes! 
That's not so hard. 
How many did we sell today? 
Four. 
And all were to Johnny. 
I think I've made a terrible mistake. 
It's only been three days. 
Business will pick up. 
No, with Johnny. 
It's different now that he's available. 
Maybe I'm the kind of person who only wants something they can't have, and then when they get it, they don't want it anymore. 
Okay, but do you feel that way about the cupcake shop too? 
No, I love our cupcake shop. 
Wow, that's the first time I've ever said I loved anything out loud, except for Robitussin. 
It's Johnny. 
Well, I know what I have to do. 
Max, you can't change your mind about him now. 
He's our only customer! 
By the way, I've always loved him. 
Hey, guys. 
Um, could we talk in the kitchen? 
Yeah. 
Wait, before you go, I just wanna say that no matter what goes down in life, we are always open to your business. 
We're either gonna have crazy kitchen sex or I'm getting expelled. 
We're not having kitchen sex. 
It's way too dirty in here from other people having kitchen sex. 
So I'm getting expelled? 
It's weird, right? 
Between us? 
Yeah, I don't know what it is. 
Maybe it's an absence of a lot of candy... 
But it's not the same. 
Max! Johnny! 
I thought I heard you. 
Max! 
I can't get out! 
Maybe we're only at our best when you have another girlfriend. 
Maybe give me a call when you get that going in, like, ten minutes. 
Or I could just call you on my actual wedding day. 
Oh, cool! 
Yeah, just call me 30 minutes before the service, and I'll be there. 
Or better yet, call me at, like, your 50th wedding anniversary. 
Yeah, now that's hot. 
Max! 
Johnny! 
I'm cold! 
Kiss good-bye? 
Seriously, guys, I can't feel my toes! 
See, it's hot again 'cause we broke up! 
I'll see you at my 50th, if not before. 
First the party, now this. 
When I have a party, you won't be on the list. 
You're right. 
I deserve that. 
No, I was doing a power move. 
Please, I'm begging you to come. 
We'll see. 
I might be a little too busy with my big, successful cupcake shop, so suck it. 
﻿1 Can I get another refill? 
Yes. 
Can I get an explanation of why you're wearing overalls when there are no goats around? 
Oh, wait... 
Now he's drumming. 
Overalls, free coffee refills, and drumming. 
We can stop looking, we found the world's most annoying hipster. 
Max, this isn't a diner where everything comes with attitude and E. coli. 
This is the cupcake shop. 
You own this place. 
Ugh, success really cuts your balls off! 
We get it. 
Your tribe's in trouble. 
Hey, she's kidding. 
Just help yourself to a fresh mocha almond refill. 
And by the way, sick beats. 
You threw him a peace sign? 
What are you, a Japanese teenager? 
It's a gesture of goodwill. 
Okay, but if I see you doing an open heart, I will kill you. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Hey, there's Andy. 
I don't want him to see me. 
Did you just openly wave to my ex-boyfriend? 
Yeah, I always wave at him. 
He didn't die just because you stopped letting him touch your boobies. 
Well, I don't wave to the guy at the record shop that you had sex with. 
I had sex with the guy at the record shop? 
I should keep a diary. 
Oh, God, he's coming back. 
See what you started with your wave? 
I'm sorry. 
My hand is friendly. 
Ask any guy in high school. 
I was gonna try and sneak by, but that just seemed so juvenile, so here... 
"Do you guys still like me? 
"Check 'Yes' or 'No.' " 
So how's she doing? 
 She's good. 
 Really? 
Oh, by the way, the guy at the record store says hi. 
Well, you tell him I said, "who are you?" 
And I also came in because I wanted to make sure everything's cool with you and me, Max. 
I mean, you haven't texted me a pic of an unlikely animal friendship in, like, 48 hours. 
Don't worry, we're cool. 
I just haven't been able to top the picture I sent of the monkey tickling a parrot. 
I get it. 
You have high standards. 
Whereas, me, I see a black dog spooning a brown dog, and I pull the trigger. 
Well, save that amateur crap for your mom, perhaps with an aunt and uncle CC. 
Ha, that is so me. 
Well, sir, you have raised the bar. 
I look forward to our next freaky/adorable animal pic. 
Well, are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
Since we broke up, he got fat. 
It's only been four days. 
Wynonna Judd gets fat in an hour. 
I'm too exhausted to even think about Andy. 
Let's just change and get to the diner. 
Look, all we have to do is make it through eight more hours, and then we can get a good night's sleep. 
Max, you're taking your pants off in public! 
Oh, my God! 
I'm so tired, I forgot where I was! 
They're halfway down. 
What do I do? 
I'm too tired to make the call. 
And I'll have the BLT with the French fries. 
Miss? I think our waitress 
is asleep. 
Yeah, she's tired. 
We haven't slept a lot lately. 
When she wakes up, she'll take your order. 
 But we're really hungry  Leave her alone! 
So I come to your job and wake you up? 
Hi, can I take your order? 
I can see how tired you are, Max. 
And if I could turn the clock back to '75, I'd help you out with a nice bump of cocaine. 
But I don't do that anymore. 
Earl, you quit coke in 1975? 
No, when I was 75, last year. 
It just felt like time. 
Now all I can give you is a nice bump of this. 
Max, I need you to explain something to me 'cause I can't figure it out. 
That's hard to believe, since you're 90% head. 
It's not a laughing matter, Max. 
I broke my mother's pelvis coming out. 
At least you finally came out. 
Oh, so you're awake enough to ridicule the boss, but not awake enough to wait on tables. 
Exactly. See, 
there's that big head working. 
And don't exaggerate. 
Caroline and I are doing a great job. 
 Wake up. 
 Hi, can I take your order? 
All I knows is. 
if I was doing my job as bad as you two tonight, I'd take my own life. 
That's not off the table. 
Come on, Han, cut us a break. 
We're working two jobs, we got two hours of sleep. 
We just want to get home and climb into bed. 
You're sleeping together? 
I mean, it's been a "will they or won't they" since they met. 
Hi, everybody. 
Sophie's here! 
And look at my new coat. 
It's double-breasted. 
Pretty nice, huh? 
It was a gift from me. 
It's the only thing he ever gave me that didn't threaten my reproductive health. 
Think that fox took its own life when it saw what kind of coat it was gonna be on. 
What is the occasion? 
What is the occasion? 
I'm hot and it's cold. 
And it's also the anniversary of the first time Oleg and I 70ed. 
The way I do it, it's one more than 69. 
Max, I just hung up from a very panicked phone call, and you'll never believe what happened. 
The guy from the record store called to say I have super gonorrhea? 
You actually think a guy that you don't even remember called to tell me that you have super gonorrhea? 
Yes, that's how tired I am. 
Are you gonna make me wait forever? Do I have it or not? 
It's not super gonorrhea, but it is super-bad news. 
This woman just called to confirm her order for 1,000 cupcakes for tomorrow. 
I've been so tired, I completely forgot. 
I'd rather have super gonorrhea! 
Are you insane? We can't do 
1,000 cupcakes by tomorrow. 
Wehaveto  do it. 
It'll ruin our reputation if we don't. 
I know we're tired, but if we stay up all night, we'll have $4,000 by tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. 
They have to be done by 10:00 a.m.? 
I'm so tired, remind me Is a.m. the morning one? 
We can't do it. 
It's impossible. 
My brain's too foggy to crunch the numbers, but I'm sure it's doable if we leave right now. 
We're in the middle of waiting tables. 
Well, we'll just have to come up with an excuse. 
Give me your hand, bend over, and pretend to be sick. 
It'll work. I've used this 
to get out of eight jobs, six final exams, and one wedding. 
Han, we have an emergency. 
Caroline's sick. 
She's so sick, she can't even stand up. 
We won't be able to stay and finish our shift. 
We have to go right to the emergency room. 
We don't know what's wrong with her, but it's coming out of both ends. 
It might be super gonorrhea. 
Bye. 
That's so unfortunate. 
And on the night they were finally gonna do it. 
Whoa, those are some big-ass coffees! 
Yep, 64-ouncers. 
They told me they're bigger than the human stomach. 
And the coffee's already working, 'cause I figured out if it's midnight now, we have to be done at 10:00 a.m. 
So if it's 40 minutes per batch from beginning to end, baking 4 dozen at a time, that's 48 cupcakes times 20 trips to the oven, which equals nine hours, which equals $4,000. 
Give me that. 
Let's see if I can do math too. 
Ask me something. 
16 times 12. 
I'm just going to enjoy my coffee. 
You enjoy, I'll preheat the oven. 
 What's the temp? 
 325. 
There, that's the coffee talking. 
Andy just sent me a picture of a deer nursing a turtle. 
This is why they tell teen turtles never to post up on Facebook. 
Oh, I didn't realize you two were still texting. 
Well, we're mostly just sending pictures of unlikely animal friendships. 
See, there's a bear napping with a bunny. 
And what's this? 
It's a labradoodle high-fiving a koi fish. 
It's pretty self-explanatory. 
No, underneath that. 
This-- "How's Caroline?" 
I thought this was just an unlikely animal friendship. 
It is, mostly, but every other text, I get the idea that maybe he's not over you. 
He's the one who broke up with me. 
Well, maybe he regrets it. 
Maybe you two are like Chris Brown and Rihanna, minus the punching and the duet. 
I'm kind of surprised. 
I thought you guys were good together. 
Andy is great. 
And on the surface, he was there for me and very supportive. 
But then he kind of got fed up when it was so much about me and my career. 
And when push came to shove, he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being. 
Oh, my God, we are Rihanna and Chris Brown! 
But I'm Chris Brown. 
Speaking of Chris Brown, I'm gonna start to batter. 
How's that stove? 
Warm, but it's really wobbly. 
Yeah, it wobbles, it smokes, and one time it burned me. 
That's why I nicknamed it "Mom." 
What is this wood thing under the leg? 
it's the shim. 
I think it's making it worse. 
Don't! 
That's holding the leg up! 
Oh! Aah! 
But I guess you figured that out now. 
You heard me say it was the shim! 
I don't know what a shim is. 
I thought it was just one of those things you say. 
What did you think it could be? 
I thought it was a cool word blend. 
You know, like she/him for a transsexual--a shim. 
You thought a tiny transsexual was holding up our stove? 
Yes, Max, I'm that tired. 
I thought a tiny transsexual was holding up our stove. 
This is a disaster, and our oven at home's too small. 
What are we gonna do now? 
Oh, good, you're still here. 
Don't anybody leave. 
Our night just got worse. 
Don't come any closer, super gonorrhea! 
I'm sorry to say we lied to get off our shift. 
But we have to bake 1,000 cupcakes by tomorrow, and our oven broke at the shop, and we need to use yours. 
You lied to me, and now you want a favor? 
Yes. Han, we know 
it's a big favor, and it probably looks even bigger to you, but I'm sure you can see past our lie. 
And if you can't, you can get up on that chair, I could put you on our shoulders... 
Long story abnormally short, will you help us? 
Well, those 12 short jokes really primed me. 
Fine, you can use the oven and any of the supplies you need. 
Thank you. We really need 
to fill this order. 
I'll stay and help. 
I also had something to fill, but I'll just text Sophie and tell her I'm working. 
I'll help too. 
I can't bake, but I can sit and lift the spirits. 
As long as there are spirits. 
It's open bar, right, Han? 
Okay, I'm in too. 
Earl, make me a sea breeze, easy on the breezy. 
You know, because of my childhood, I won't be able to process the fact that you've all just done something nice for me, so if I run into you in ten years and start crying, this is what it's about. 
900 and counting. 
Comin' through. 
 Where do you want them? 
 Put 'em over here, next to the world's slowest helper. 
It took you longer to make that one cupcake than it took James Cameron to make Avatar. 
Well, I been doing this for two minutes, and I have to say... 
Not for me. 
But you know what is for me? 
Another free cognac. 
Ready for another sea breeze, Han? 
Not before I get this right. 
And you don't want to see me on two sea breezes. 
What happens, you become Lindsay Llo-Han? 
Okay, let me show you how it's done. 
There, you feel how that is, Han? 
Uh, yes. 
Now just squeeze that bag. 
Good. Little harder. 
Good. Little harder. 
Whoa! Oh... 
I'm humiliated. 
It's okay, Han, it happens to a lot of guys their first time. 
Get yourself a tissue and clean yourself off, like everyone else. 
Han, you're off the bag. 
I'm moving you to batter. 
It's not a demotion, it's just that you stink at this. 
I wanna give you something easier. 
Max, you just got that all over your apron. 
I'll wipe it down. 
Mine's a mess too. 
Ooh, pretty slick move. 
You wanna try for my bra next? 
Yeah, baby, I'll take off your bra. 
What the hell was that? 
What? 
It's my guy voice. 
That's your go-to guy voice? 
Is his identity being protected on Dateline? 
Well, what's your guy voice like? 
I'm doing it right now. 
I'm gonna take a quick pee break. 
I don't know, I think you might be making the drinks too strong. 
We're not drunk, Oleg, just punchy. 
I'm just drunk. 
It was so nice of everyone to stay that long. 
Everything's baked except for those. 
We've gonna make it, Max. 
Andy sent me a cat and a dolphin kissing. 
I hope they go all the way. 
I'm dying to see their baby. 
A cat-dolphin? Yes! 
I don't think that's healthy. 
Well, if they're in love, it's really none of your business. 
Why are you texting him in the middle of the night? 
In fact, why is he still up? 
Is he talking about me? 
You look upset. 
Do you want me to stop texting him? 
No. It's fine. 
It's just I'm tired and we're almost finished, and I just wanna go home. 
Got it. 
I'm so hot. 
Let me just get this hair off my neck. 
Max, why are you wearing only one earring? 
What are you talking about? 
I'm wearing two. 
That's weird. Where is it? 
Is it in my hair? 
 No, no. 
 Did it fall down? 
Yeah, check your boobs. 
That's where you found the remote. 
It's not it's not anywhere on me. 
Well, when's the last time you saw it? 
I don't know, but it couldn't have gone far. 
I was in this area pretty much the whole night. 
You mean over the batter? 
No, no, no. 
Nothing, nothing, nothing! 
No, no, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing! 
No, no, no, no, no! 
Nothing, nothing, no! 
It's not here, which means it's in one of those already-baked cupcakes. 
Let's go. We have to start 
pulling these apart. 
Really? Come on, 
don't be ridiculous. 
Look, worst-case scenario, one of the 1,000 cupcakes has an earring in it. 
We'll tell them it's a surprise. 
No, the worst-case scenario is someone bites into it, rips their lip open, and sues us. 
Let them sue us. 
We don't have any money. 
And that's why we'll go to jail. 
Yep, I'll be locked up raw and forced to be someone's girlfriend. 
I mean, I'm a bad girlfriend out of prison. 
It's not gonna be any easier with big Joan. 
Calm down. If we go to prison, 
I'll be your girlfriend. 
Until someone hotter comes along, 'cause that's the way it goes in prison. 
Start looking. 
I am not going to smash 900 cupcakes. 
Then we'll just have to start over. 
Oh, no, I would rather hitch a ride West and become a sister-wife. 
This is crazy. 
Can't I just text them and tell them we can't do the job? 
No, you can't text them. 
We need the money. 
And stop with all the texting. 
Maybe if you were thinking less about texting with my ex-boyfriend, you wouldn't have lost your earring in the first place. 
You should have just said it. 
You have a problem with me texting Andy. 
I do not have a problem with it! 
Oh, good, 'cause he's my friend too. 
You'd think your loyalty to your best friend and business partner would be more important than some stupid animal friendship! 
I mean... 
I'm surprised I even have to tell you that, Max. 
It's kind of girl code. 
Oh, I am way to tired to hear "girl code." 
Shut it down. 
Girl code, Max. 
Girl code. 
Shut up, Caroline. 
Shut up! 
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response. 
Yeah, that was the goal, bitch. 
I don't have time for this. 
I have to find an earring that you lost in one of these thousand cupcakes, bitch! 
The thousand cupcakes that you forgot to tell me about! 
And the girl code means that when a girl breaks up with someone, you don't interfere with their boyfriend, because she needs some distance! 
Well, why didn't you tell me that when I asked you 14 hours ago? 
Hey, Max. 
I got your text. 
I'm here to help. 
Um, that was a pre-girl-code text. 
I thought we maybe needed a backup after Earl passed up and I made Han cry. 
Andy, on the list of things I feel guilty about in life, calling you to help in the middle of the night is number two. 
It would be number one if I hadn't pushed that girl down the stairs to get into the 98 Degrees concert before her. 
Well, it was 98 Degrees. 
People had to die. 
Okay, let's stop all this joking and get down to why I really came here. 
Come on, Caroline, love me. 
Did you just say, "Caroline, love me"? 
No, I said, "Caroline, glove me." 
What kind of loser would say, "love me"? 
Unless you do. 
So how you doing? 
I'm okay. 
A little tired. 
You know, I've been thinking about you a lot. 
Pretty much all the time since we broke up. 
Um, maybe I overreacted to your whole obsession with work thing, you know? 
 Well, you are here at 4:00 a.m. 
'Cause I needed help making 1,000 cupcakes in four hours. 
One might call that obsessive. 
One might. 
Or pretty much everyone might. 
And, Andy, just know that even though it didn't work out, I do glove you. 
I glove you too. 
Now, get the cupcakes out before they burn. 
I don't have the energy to do this all again. 
Ah, there's the girl I broke up with. 
Everything's ready to go out there. 
I've had my hands in more boxes tonight than a gynecologist at a free clinic. 
It's not that funny. 
Stay up another 27 hours, it'll be the funniest damn thing you ever heard. 
Well, that's the end of it. 
Yeah, I think it is. 
Max, I'm talking about more than the cupcakes. 
Yeah, I could tell by your Bradley Cooper tone. 
So what, it's not gonna work out between you two? 
No. And I think 
we have to break up. 
I thought you already broke up. 
No, I'm talking about you and me. 
You're dumping me? 
Wow, last guy who dumped me, I burned down his house and moved. 
Still wanna continue this conversation? 
Max, it wouldn't work. 
I would always be asking you about Caroline. 
Look, I get it, it's weird. 
People don't usually stay friends with their friend's ex, but then, cats don't usually become friends with dolphins. 
But sometimes, for no apparent reason, it happens. 
Yeah, I just wish I was as grown up as a cat or a dolphin. 
I hear ya. 
So what's next, breakup text? 
Nah, that's just gonna lead to makeup text, and then we're back in a vicious cycle. 
All right, I'll just stop by your place, pick up my CDs, my T-shirts, and the 3 grand I left there. 
Max, you've never been to my place. 
See, this is why I'm breaking up with you you're a liar. 
See you in small claims court, bub. 
Well, we did it, Max. 
We made $4,000. 
And as far as Andy and I go, I think we're in the right place, because when he said he'd been thinking about me since the breakup, I realized I'd only been thinking about the cupcakes. 
Oh, please, God, shut up. 
Thank you. 
I was dying to shut up. 
Ooh. 
Look, it's a text from the place. 
They loved the cupcakes. 
Wait, why do I have my phone in your apron? 
No, my phone was in my apron. 
Unless I handed you the wrong apron after I wiped them down. 
What? What? 
Oh... Your earring. 
I had it in there the whole time. 
Oh, we're idiots! 
We're two very different kinds of idiots, but we're idiots. 
And yet, somehow we work. 
We're the most unlikely animal friends. 
I don't know about that, but a picture of me nursing you would definitely go viral. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
Where you going? 
I'm too tired to pull my bed down. 
 I'm sleeping with you. 
 No, you're not. 
You have super gonorrhea. 
Max, I can't wait to go home and ilegally download that documentary about performance art. 
And I can't wait to go home and watch "Here comes Honey Boo Boo." 
But first you have to see this. 
Her name is Marina Abramovic. 
In the 90's she and her boyfriend did this piece called "Confrontation" where they just slapped each other's faces for days. 
Oh yeah? 
My mom and her boyfriend did that too, but they called it, "Who smoked the last cigarette." 
No, really, it was pure art. 
She's a genius. 
How about you and I do a little art right now? 
Ah. 
What are they doing? 
I think they might be doing a scene from Fifty Shades Of Grey. 
Ah, okay, stop. 
Okay. 
That's for suggesting to Call Me Maybe. 
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh * Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh * What's up, my man? 
You look pretty down. 
My mother in Korea is working my last nerve, you know, Earl? 
Well, uh, I didn't expect a back and forth here. 
Uh, Max, do you wanna move in? 
Han, you can't let your mommy keep bullying you. 
Stand up to her. 
You're a 53-year-old man. 
Max, I am 29. 
What? 
I am 29. 
What do you got, a case of the Benjamin Buttons? 
Caroline, Han says he's 29. 
What? 
Han, are you sure? 
Yes, what makes you think I'm older? 
 Well, everything... 
your hair, your clothes, the $5 check you gave me for my birthday. 
Hi, can I help you? 
Ooh, that sounded so sincere. 
Well, when you're in my section, you'll meet the real me. 
I have one question. 
Do you wanna live? 
Actually, today, I could go either way. 
You see this? 
Go around the diner and have everyone fill it with the contents of their purse, and if you do, nobody gets hurt. 
Okay, okay, okay, but, uh, I don't know how much you're gonna collect here. 
I mean, most of these customers pay with coins or fresh tomatoes from their garden. 
Uh, Earl, listen up. 
We're being robbed by that man in the suit, and he wants everyone to empty their stuff into this bag. 
Uh, Max, I've been on both sides of this situation, and the best thing to do is play along. 
Okay, Caroline, I'm gonna tell you something, and I don't want you to react. 
I knew you were gonna get pregnant. 
Damn it! 
All right, fine. 
 We'll get through this together. 
 No! 
Look, we're being robbed, and that guy in the suit might have a gun. 
No, no...just do what I say, 
and stay calm. 
I need you to empty your purse into the trash bag. 
I can't believe this is happening just when I saved $2. 
Max, I can't die, and I certainly can't die in this ugly uniform. 
I mean, it looks good on you. 
Are you having a heart attack? 
I'm peeing. 
What do you mean? 
I'm really freaked out, and I'm peeing. 
I can't stop! 
Just stop, stop! 
Clench it. 
Okay. 
No, can't. 
Step out from behind the counter. 
Sorry, sir, I can't. 
 Why? 
 Well, um, I'm peeing. 
Still? 
Out of the way, girls. 
I'll take down this... 
whoa! 
Get away from him. 
Miss, you need to get out from behind the counter now  before I... 
 Uh, please take her, not me. 
 What's happening? 
 Han, we're being robbed. 
So sorry. 
Please take everything that is in my manny-pack. 
Would it be possible if I took my prayer beads out? 
They've been in my family for hundreds and hundreds of... 
I don't think so, homeboy. 
You're in my house now, bitch. 
Here's what's left in the bag. 
Nope, sorry. 
I don't see your dignity. 
Max, don't. 
Isn't it enough that I'm wearing dishwasher whites that have been around since the invention of B.O.? 
Oh, look at that, something ate right through the swiffer, and I don't think it was the bleach. 
How will you ever live with the shame? 
Can you believe that is the man who saved us? 
Yeah, I did not see a gun coming. 
I saw nunchucks, ninja smoke, maybe some hairpulling, but not a gun. 
Well, good night, ladies. 
I thought we all acted very brave tonight. 
Well, some of us. 
Oh, yeah, I had a trauma, and I urinated. 
Ha, ha! 
That's hilarious. 
Yeah, you might need some counseling. 
I could drop you off at a therapist on the way to my "I was a human shield" support group. 
Am I ever gonna live this down? 
It happened, like, ten minutes ago. 
Okay, let's move on. 
Oh, look, someone left a coupon for free movie popcorn. 
Oh, I'd love to escape to a movie after my... 
well, I'd just love to escape. 
How much are movies now, like 200 bucks? 
Unless you go with me, in which case, it is free. 
I'll take you tomorrow. 
I've been sneaking into theaters since I was two. 
I crawled into The Little Mermaid with a sack full of Cheerios and a baby bottle full of Diet Coke. 
You know, Chestnut, the only thing that got me through that robbery was you. 
I kept thinking, "who will take care of you?" 
Because you can't count on blondie selfish-pants who used me as a human shield and then peed herself. 
Do not tell Chestnut I peed myself. 
He's the only one from my circle who still talks to me. 
As I was saying, Chestnut, I would have taken a bullet for her, but she put herself first, and that's okay. 
It's fine. 
Max, I'm surprised you're even affected by this. 
I mean, weren't you shot as a baby? 
I feel like you told me that. 
No, I told you I drank shots as a baby. 
My mother hated to drink alone. 
Okay, what free movie should we see? 
Maybe something with a Fanning in it? 
 I'll see anything unless it's in 3-D. 
I mean, if something's gonna be flying at my face, I'd better get a free prime rib out of it. 
So what do we do, Max? 
What do we do? 
Hide in the back alley till the coast is clear, and when the door opens, make a break for it? 
No, 'cause it's not the 1940s. 
We just go right up in the usher's face, make an excuse, and then boldly walk with purpose. 
Okay, well, just show me how. 
You can direct me. 
I've done a lot of plays. 
I could do my "Eliza Doolittle" before she was civilized" walk. 
Hello, governor. 
Wow, that was just ugly. 
I wish I hadn't seen it. 
All right, just watch me. 
Walk, walk, walk, hair flip, walk, walk. 
Walk, walk, walk, hair flip, walk, walk. 
Good, but easy on the hair flip, Willow Smith. 
Oh, hi, girls. 
Oh, I heard what happened. 
Max, you got pushed in front of a gun. 
You must be very pissed. 
Caroline, oh, what a nice outfit. 
On a scale of one to ten, you're an eight. 
Get it? 
Urinate. 
How do you even know what happened? 
Oh, well, Oleg told me when we were upstairs playing "hide the penis," and we laughed so hard, we almost peed ourselves, but we didn't because we're not you. 
Actually, we're going to a movie. 
Oh, well, that's nice. 
I hope you're gonna wear your big girl pants. 
 Max. 
 What? It's silly and funny. 
She's like a Polish fart cushion. 
Look, if it makes you feel any better, there can't be any pee jokes left. 
What are you seeing, something rated "pee pee 13"? 
Fart cushions are funny. 
 There's the guy. 
 I'm getting a little nervous. 
I'm starting to sweat like those people on Locked Up Abroad. 
I don't know why. 
I haven't swallowed a heroin balloon. 
Okay, let's go. 
Pretend we're out of breath. 
Out of breath, not out of your mind. 
Hey, sorry. 
Can we just run back into the theater for a second? 
I left my iPhone in there, and the prescription for her anti-seizure medication's on it. 
Yeah, which theater were you in? 
Theatre five. 
Went to the 11:15. 
Got out at 1:20. 
A little long. 
Could've cut ten from it. 
Wow, your walk with purpose is getting almost as impressive as Han's "bang, bang," you're in my house now, bitch!" 
I know. 
What about Han? 
Before yesterday, we thought he was 53 and unarmed. 
Guess we learn something new about people every day. 
Yeah, like having to learn that when you get nervous, I'm disposable. 
That was very uncharacteristic of me. 
Hi, um, Hallelujah. 
Cool name, by the way. 
How are you doing today, Hallelujah? 
Bitter. 
They wouldn't let me put an exclamation point on my name tag. 
Um, is there any way you could make a fresh batch of popcorn? 
I could, but it takes ten minutes, and your show starts in two. 
Actually, it takes 31/2, and I can miss a few trailers. 
I used to work at a Cineplex Five. 
Oh, so now you just know everything about life? 
Come on, the opening scene sets up where he gets his superpowers from. 
Hey, Hallelujah here is doing the best he can. 
I mean, based on his name, his parents clearly had bigger dreams for him, and it is not his fault you guys showed up two minutes before the show starts. 
Maybe next time, you'll show up ten minutes early without the attitude and the fidgety exhaling. 
You think Hallelujah doesn't hear that? 
 He does. 
 Sorry to be such a problem. 
We'll just take whatever you've got ready. 
No, girl. 
I got you. 
I'm gonna make you a fresh batch. 
Hallelujah, could I have some fresh too? 
You'll get the burnt ones and like it, nerd. 
Let's sit down here. 
Ooh, I'm not sticking to the floor yet. 
Fancy theater. 
Oh, hey, guys. 
Hope I wasn't too hard on you out there. 
Nice cape. 
Thanks. 
I had it in my backpack. 
 I wasn't sure. 
 Hmm. 
You made the right choice. 
She likes my cape. 
Technically, she likes your sister's cape. 
Okay, so I don't know anything about these superhero movies. 
It's a remake of a prequel to a sequel? 
 I'm already confused. 
 Okay. 
So there's always a nerdy guy... 
And he's either been wronged or bitten or exposed to something toxic. 
It gives him superpowers. 
He's in love with a pretty girl who his rival tries to kill but then won't because they have to make another movie. 
Also, partial nudity, product placement, dope explosions, and a killer score by Hans Zimmer. 
Okay, your knowledge of these superhero movies is kind of turning me on right now. 
Wait. 
Are you kidding me? 
The hero has red hair as a child? 
Um, weird, 'cause when he grows up, he has black hair. 
Was there some sort of chemical spill, which, by the way, wasn't in the original comic book! 
 What am I, dumb? 
 Okay. 
Okay, come on. 
Come on, let's go to another movie. 
What are you talking about? 
Well, you obviously hate this. 
You're yelling at the screen. 
Yelling at the screen is the best part of going to the movies, and more white people should learn that. 
Oh, wow, look at that. 
That car just exploded in front of those two girls, and one didn't use the other's body to block her from the flying debris. 
Are you ever gonna let this go? 
I don't know. 
I mean, it's kind of a big deal. 
You put my life in danger. 
Well, I've apologized about it twice. 
I don't know how much more I can do. 
Yeah, I could have died, but you apologized twice, so I guess we're good. 
I don't like this movie. 
It's violence against women. 
Let's go see that Katherine Heigl rom-com sequel. 
Talk about violence against women. 
I am gonna go spend some time with Katie Heigl. 
At least she won't make me feel guilty. 
See ya. 
Enjoy three Walking On Sunshine montages. 
I don't wanna go to a movie by myself, and you're right. 
I'm sorry. 
I hate the way I acted. 
I'm a spoiled rich girl, and I always put myself first, and I know that's something you would never do. 
Shut up. 
Max, I think I just saw Han. 
It is Han. 
What's he doing here? 
Why is he sitting all the way in the back? 
I don't know, maybe he's afraid of blocking absolutely no one's view. 
And who is that guy and girl he's sitting with? 
Is Han in a threesome? 
Does he secretly have game? 
Please. 
The only game Han has is "One, two, buckle my shoe." 
Wait, he's leaving, and so is the guy he was sitting next to. 
Did Han just get more interesting? 
We have to follow him. 
He can blast a wall apart with his thoughts, but he can't get out of handcuffs? 
Even I could get out of handcuffs! 
Have fun being lied to. 
You're right. 
You're always right. 
Are you seeing anyone? 
That was hard to watch. 
Why is he going to the bathroom with that stranger? 
Is Han also a republican senator? 
Usher. 
Are all men's rooms this depressing? 
We are such different people. 
I was just gonna say how nice it is. 
I don't hear sex sounds, and he's not on the changing table, so maybe drugs are involved. 
You think Han's an Asian drug dealer? 
What's he selling, crystal math? 
Oh, look. 
Han's coming. 
 Aw, gross! 
 No, no! 
I meant he's coming this way. 
Hey, you're running. 
Don't run, it's Han. 
For him, every step we take is like a 100-meter dash. 
Sorry, you're the one who doesn't want Han to see us. 
I just don't want that kind of relationship with him. 
You mean the kind of relationship where you see someone you know at the movie theater and say hello? 
Yeah, I definitely don't want that. 
Ladies, may I see your tickets, please? 
Tickets? 
Max, do you... 
Can I see your tickets, please? 
I saw you go into another theater. 
Caroline? 
Hi, honey. 
Hello? 
Honey, I forgot my ticket. 
He has my ticket. 
Han, this nice usher man thinks I snuck into the theater, so just show him the tickets. 
Uh, uh... 
You two are together? 
 Yeah, why? 
 Oh, it's nothing. 
It's none of my business, but he just seems too old for you. 
 He's 29. 
 What? 
Uh, I'm gonna have to see you and your girlfriend's ticket. 
Uh, I thought I put the ticket in here. 
Tickets. You put two tickets 
in there, honey. 
Um, okay. 
I cannot find it. 
Damn. 
Sir, you know that sneaking into a theater's a felony, right? 
It is? 
Han, what's that face? 
It's the same face I made when I peed... 
Oh, honey. 
How will I live with the shame? 
Well, at least your fanny pack isn't the most embarrassing thing about you any more. 
Well, well, well, look who it is. 
Hair flip and go. 
I don't know what you're doing, but it feels weird. 
Now, look who's walk, walk, walking with purpose away from me again. 
What? 
It wasn't a big deal. 
Really? 'Cause I went 
to movie jail with Han. 
 Cool. 
 We have a mug shot. 
We're a notorious gangster couple now down at the Cineplex. 
That's right, Han-nie and Clyde, but you know what, I'm fine. 
I'm thrilled, actually, because you walking away gave me one thing. 
An obstructed view of my sweet, sweet ass? 
No, the satisfaction of knowing that you are just as selfish as me. 
What a selfish thing to say. 
You can walk, walk, walk away from me, Max, but you can't walk away from knowing that you split the scene. 
What? I thought you 
were behind me, and besides, we couldn't both get caught. 
Who would live to tell the tale of the great Caroline Channing, the girl who couldn't walk fast enough? 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
Don't turn this around. 
Now, I see it, the whole "Max" of it all. 
When we got caught, you only thought about saving yourself, and you weren't defending poor Hallelujah. 
You just wanted fresh popcorn for yourself. 
What can I say? 
I guess you're on to me. 
You said you'd take a bullet for me. 
You'd never take a bullet for me. 
Probably not. 
No one ever takes a bullet. 
It's just something people say that they don't mean, like, "how was your day?" 
Or, "we'll stop if it hurts." 
Wow, so this is who we are, huh? 
Two selfish girls who always put ourselves before everyone else and are willing to do anything to survive? 
Guess we are. 
Man, we're gonna crush the cupcake competition. 
But, Max, even though we're ruthless, every now and then, on our own behalf, we do put ourselves second, and I guess that's what makes us best friends. 
I don't think I've ever done that. 
Yes, you have. 
You let me stay on your couch when I had no place to stay. 
I guess I did. 
And I gave you... 
Go ahead. 
Well, there must be something where I didn't put myself first. 
Let me know when you find it. 
Sophie, just look at you. 
You couldn't look more scrumptious. 
Oh, maybe I could with a little chocolate drizzled on me. 
Oh, good, there you are, Han. 
I just have one question that I have to ask you. 
What is your favorite musical? 
Is it The Wiz? 
Whiz, Max! 
I found another one, right? 
How do you even know about this? 
Oh, Oleg told me while we were having phone sex. 
And by phone sex, she means we were using the phone in the sex. 
Don't worry, Han. 
A lot of older men can't control their bladder. 
I am twenty-freaking-nine! 
Ooh, what? 
I'm humiliated, Max. 
Hey, listen to me. 
You didn't sell Caroline out. 
A lot of people would have, but you just stood there like a man and peed your pants. 
That's true. 
I did. 
By the way, Han, why were you at the movies in the middle of the day? 
Sometimes people bug me, and I need some time away. 
You know what, Han? 
You're cool. 
We're gonna hang sometime. 
Not now, not in a week, but in the future. 
Just sayin', I got my eye on you. 
﻿1 Well, here it is. 
My last tip. 
Only $2. 
And to think, I held in a fart for those cheap bastards. 
This night sucks. 
We don't even have enough to buy supplies for tomorrow. 
We'll just have to go to that store where everything's free. 
Oh, good. 
They're open. 
And we have to sneak all this stuff out. 
Han's staying late to do inventory. 
Damn it, why does he always have to be so Asian? 
Let's see, what do we need for our cupcake shop? 
Eggs, sugar A stripper pole? 
Do you want to make money or not? 
How are we gonna hide these eggs? 
You could put some of those "Grade A large" where there's "Grade A itty-bitties." 
Rude, but I don't hate it. 
I can probably fit four to six in each. 
So positive! 
I love that you're a "cup's half full" kind of person. 
So come here often? 
This is my first time. 
 Well, you're very pretty. 
 Oh, thank you. 
Heads up. 
Han's coming your way. 
Should I fake a stroke? 
And P.S., if I don't get up 
in three minutes, it's a real one. 
No, I'll deal with him. 
You keep going. 
Keep it up, and we'll finally have an answer to the question "What comes first? 
The chicken or the Oleg?" 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Here you go. 
I just found the greatest thing online. 
The ultrasound of the Kim and Kanye baby where someone photoshopped a "666" on its little baby butt? 
Wait, this kid's half Kardashian. 
Its big baby butt. 
Wow, that baby's already famous for doing nothing... 
Just like its mom. 
No, what I found is a site where we can apply for a small business grant. 
There's a couple of categories: Womenowned business No thanks. 
I've been to jail. 
I was already owned by a woman. 
There's also a minority-owned category. 
You don't know who your father is, and you do have an exotic look. 
Any chance he could be Native American? 
Yes, in fact, I think his name was Chief Running Away. 
Wait. 
Maybe we don't even need your father. 
We are white, which according to the last presidential election, is the new minority. 
So now all we need is a letter of recommendation from someone who owns another start-up business. 
I was thinking of a recommendation from Candy Andy's Sweets and Treats. 
I've already written it, so he just has to sign it. 
Will you ask Andy? 
I can't, he's my ex. 
And I'm saving up my favor for a booty call on a cold night. 
I hate asking men for things. 
Favors, last names, to stop. 
Excuse me, could I get some more Sweet'n Low? 
Why don't you look in your purse? 
It's where I saw you put them. 
I'm so embarrassed. 
Don't be. 
I wasn't when I stole them last night. 
What did Andy say? 
He's gone. 
 For lunch? 
 Forever. 
The man is gone. 
His store is empty. 
Oh, my God, this is so sad. 
I know. 
There goes the candy. 
And my booty call. 
 He didn't even leave a note? 
 Or a razzle? 
Forget the candy. 
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that my ex-boyfriend left without so much as a peep? 
Great. 
Now I want peeps. 
Hey, Max. 
Is today the day we're gonna get married? 
Sure, Amir. 
'Cause my dream in life is to be detained for four hours on our honeymoon flight. 
Max, you do know I was born in this country, right? 
You were born here? 
How old are you? 
About Zero Dark Thirty? 
Yeah, you were born in a Walmart, right? 
Where do you think the expression "Clean up on aisle 12" comes from? 
Hey, Caroline, you bummed you drove your boyfriend out of town? 
For the record, I did not chase Andy away. 
We ended our relationship well. 
Right, that's why I helped him move out in the middle of the night. 
Man, you messed that up. 
So self-involved. 
Wow. 
Coming in a little hot, Amir. 
Yeah, guns ablazin'. 
If I was allowed to carry them. 
Oh, Amir. 
You're the bomb. 
Look at us. 
We're like Homeland, if it was a rom-com. 
You don't have to read it, Han. 
It's just a standard letter of recommendation. 
Don't be a bitch. 
Just sign it. 
I'm not comfortable putting my name on a document I haven't read. 
I understand, but don't be a bitch. 
Just sign it. 
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes is an up-and-coming powerhouse business." 
I can't sign this. 
This has more lies than my OKCupid profile. 
Don't be a bitch. 
Just sign it. 
That one's on me, girls. 
If I sign this, it's lying. 
I could get deported. 
And I'm one home inspection away from a poodle adoption. 
A poodle? That's cool. 
You can share sweaters. 
Hurry up, bitch. 
The deadline to mail that is tonight. 
Well, if you just wanted to steamroll someone, why didn't you get your boyfriend, Andy, to sign it? 
They split. 
He left last night without a peep. 
Damn it, now I'm thinking about those peeps again. 
Oh, I was worried you two wouldn't make it. 
You always have your mind on business, and Andy was such an easy spirit. 
I think you mean "free spirit." 
Easy spirit is a shoe worn by people whose spirits have died. 
I have two pairs. 
Okay, fine. 
Give it back. 
I'll find someone else with a business. 
What about Sophie? 
She owns a small business, and she loves to give, not as much as she loves to receive. 
I'm not so sure Sophie's cleaning business is totally, well, legal. 
I mean, when we worked for her, on the memo line of our paycheck, she wrote "colonoscopy." 
And for the record, Sophie's cleaning business is totally legit. 
Her organ-trading might not be. 
Forget it, Caroline. 
We might deport you ourselves. 
All we need is a FedEx box. 
Um, Caroline. 
Come over here. 
I think I can help you with that. 
Thanks, Earl, but you don't have a small business. 
The size of my business has never been in question. 
And I may not have a business, but... 
Han Lee does. 
Max, look. 
Earl forged Han's signature. 
That's what his signature looks like. 
When I forge it, I just draw a picture of Hello Kitty. 
You want to know your future? 
Oh. 
No, no thanks. 
You sure? 
I have a message about your love life. 
$10. 
Are you asleep? 
Max? 
Max, I really need to talk. 
Oh, just come in and get it over with. 
Everybody else does. 
Max, I'm sorry, but I really need to talk. 
I went to the fortune teller near the diner, and she told me that I'd never find love in my life. 
Fortune-telling's a scam. 
"You'll never find a man, your moon's in Uranus, no man will ever be in Uranus." 
I could've told you that the second day I met you. 
Please, Max, just listen for five minutes. 
Come over here. 
I'll make you some tea. 
Tea? 
Who am I, Pippa Middleton? 
Toast me an eggo waffle and maybe I'm listening. 
Well, we were saving that waffle for a special occasion, but okay. 
Chestnut, we're eating your birthday waffle now. 
I don't know why I'm pissing him off. 
He's gonna be the only man in my life. 
I can't believe you blew $10 on a psychic. 
Why didn't you just buy a Skinnygirl Margarita like all the other lonely white chicks? 
I spent $50. 
I bought a crystal that protects me from bad juju. 
Hey! There's no reason 
to get anti-semitic. 
You spent money on crystal you can't snort? 
What is wrong with you? 
I freaked out. 
I didn't want it to be true. 
Is it true, Max? 
Am I never gonna find love? 
Was Andy my one chance? 
Did I screw it up because I wanted success? 
Was everyone right? 
That is a lot of questions for one waffle. 
And where is that waffle? 
You're a bad waitress at home too. 
Who could that be? 
I don't know. 
Let me consult the spirits. 
Who is it? 
It's Sophie. 
Yeah, it's me, the shady lady with the illegal business. 
Yeah, and Caroline, you owe me an apology or I will take out these hoops, and we will get into it, girl. 
Yeah, and I warn you, I did some extreme fighting in Warsaw. 
Extreme fighting? 
That's awesome. 
Yeah, they would throw a big hunk of cheese in a trough and let all the village girls just go at it. 
Sorry, Sophie. 
It just seemed like a better business decision to go with the forgery. 
What is that? 
Is that a waffle? 
Okay! 
You are forgiven. 
Damn it. 
I didn't even get a bite. 
I'm awake and sober for nothing. 
Sophie, do you believe in psychics? 
Oh, no. 
That's all fake. 
You know, I knew a family of gypsy psychics who couldn't even predict that they would all die in a barn fire. 
Hey, girls. 
Sorry to interrupt, but Sophie promised to rub antifungal cream on my thick, yellow toenails. 
Oleg, come over here. 
I'll do it in between bites. 
This is what you're afraid you're missing? 
Because this is a relationship. 
Seriously, Max. 
That's something I really want. 
And now I'm never gonna have it. 
Get in there, baby. 
I have two feet. 
Interesting. 
She's a psychic, but she needs a bell to tell her someone's here. 
Max, please don't make me do this. 
I don't want to hear any more bad things. 
Nothing bad's gonna happen. 
She's gonna tell you you have a bright, love-filled future or I'm gonna kick her in the crystal balls. 
Hello, girls. 
I'll tell you your future as soon as I finish eating. 
It'll only take a minute. 
Since I quit smoking, I eat like a prisoner. 
Come, sit, ruminate on your wishes and dreams. 
Well, my wish is that you give my friend her money back, and my dream is that I'm a backup dancer for Missy Elliott. 
Great. A wise-ass. 
Do you want to know your future or not? 
Um, you already told me my future. 
That's why we're here. 
You said I'd never find love. 
When did I say that? 
And you, tough guy, don't say, "Well, you're the psychic." 
Maybe she is a psychic, because I am a tough guy and I was gonna say that. 
You know, it's hard to remember. 
I see a lot of sad, single girls. 
But looking at you right now, it makes sense. 
And here. 
Take your phony crystal back. 
And I'm not so sure this is a real crystal. 
It looks like one of those vegan deodorant things. 
And we want our money. 
Oh, okay. 
What just happened? 
I put a curse on you. 
Max, you said nothing bad was gonna happen! 
Well, I'm not a psychic, and neither is she. 
Laugh, Buster. 
Nothing in life will go your way, and you will live under a dark cloud. 
Will this dark cloud merge with the current dark cloud above me or fly alongside of it? 
Look, we don't want to trouble you, but if you could remove the curse and possibly that noodle on your blouse... 
Oh, no. 
Did you just Cursed you too. 
Tell you what. 
I'll lift both curses for 50, or else your whole life will come crashing down all around you. 
The only way I'm giving a strange woman 50 bucks is if I'm walking out of here with a genital piercing. 
I do that as well. 
Don't believe in curses, never have. 
Not since Jennifer Martin told me I was going to hell for sleeping with her boyfriend. 
But I didn't. 
I just ended up going to homecoming with him. 
Max, we have to go back and pay her. 
Our lives are hard enough. 
We don't need things to come crashing down around us. 
Relax. Nothing's coming 
crashing down around us. 
Don't jump, Paul! 
Paul, don't jump! 
Paul? Who's Paul? 
Oh. 
And what is he doing on the roof? 
Okay. 
That was Paul's life that came crashing down, not ours. 
Max, I think we all know that I'm a highly educated woman who doesn't really believe in curses, but I am putting every penny we make tonight in the "lift the curse" fund. 
And I'm gonna tell you one more time, we're not spending another 50 bucks on some stupid curse. 
A body fell from the sky! 
Paul got a bad batch of shrooms. 
It had nothing to do with the curse. 
Everyone knows you don't take psychedelics above the second floor. 
Poor amateur bastard. 
And we need our money for essentials, like food and the penguin statue I saw at the Dollar Store. 
The one that says "Chill out." 
So chill out. 
Caroline, I feel bad about not signing your letter of recommendation. 
So I wrote one myself and signed it. 
Here. 
That's so nice of you. 
"The extremely hardworking Caroline Channing, "who has devoted her life to business and nothing and no one else." 
Han, this is supposed to be about getting a loan, not being alone. 
I totally get it, girl. 
I'm alone as well. 
We have our eyes on the prize, so our beds are empty. 
But occasionally, I pay for it. 
Did Han just intimate that he occasionally gets a hooker? 
Lucky bastard. 
He probably gets a child's discount. 
Max, look. 
The future's already happening. 
Even in Han's letter, I'm alone. 
The only chance for a love life I have now is going halfsies on a hooker with Han. 
We have to reverse the curse now. 
News flash: Everybody is cursed. 
You lost your money last year. 
Literally nothing good has ever happened to me. 
Han hasn't grown since the fourth grade. 
Oleg's toenails look like Fritos. 
And Earl was born black at the eighth-or ninth-worst time to be a black man in America. 
Look around, it's the valley of the damned. 
Name one person who isn't cursed. 
Hey, guys! 
I just found a $100 bill on the sidewalk! 
Drinks for everyone! 
Max, pop open the fancy brandy. 
"Fancy Brandy" is gonna be my stripper name if you ever let me put in that pole. 
Sophie, guess what? 
We went back to that psychic to complain, and she put a curse on us. 
Oh. 
You're cursed? 
Uh... 
But it's stupid, like you said, right? 
Yeah, yeah. 
That's stupid. 
Yeah. 
Did she mention me? 
No. 
She just cursed us and said our whole lives would come crashing down around us. 
And 30, 40, 50. 
The curse is lifted. 
Oh, I don't think you got me. 
What about my curse? 
Talk about phoning it in. 
Couldn't you wave a feather or spin your head or throw up or something? 
That's extra. 
You know what? 
I'm in a good mood tonight. 
I got through the whole day on 15 cigarettes and one sheet cake. 
I'm gonna give tough guy a free reading here. 
Oh, free, as in the $50 you just shook us down for? 
Should never have quit. 
Okay. 
Future coming right at you. 
I see that you will have a happy life. 
Me, happy? 
All right, get your hat, mother. We're leaving. 
And I see a large sum of money coming your way. 
Over $10,000. 
Max, it's the grant. 
We applied for $12,000. 
Is that it? 
Sure. 
And in spite of your bad childhood... 
She knew you had a bad childhood. 
Come on, every childhood is bad. 
You're stupid. 
You can't reach stuff. 
It's rough. 
In spite of it, I see great love and children in your future. 
Max. 
Me? 
No, wait. 
You must be picking up on her vibes. 
Check again. 
No, great love and children will be part of your future. 
She will die alone. 
Okay, well, that's all I can take. 
I'm not gonna sit here and wait for the other Paul to fall. 
 Let's go, Max. 
 No, no, no, no. 
No, no. Wait. 
She obviously got it wrong. 
Didn't you? 
Nope. 
Still dying alone... 
With nothing but her great success. 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
What? 
I see great success in your future. 
You do? 
Oh, thank God. 
I'm gonna have success? 
How big a success? 
Oh, honey, it's so big, you won't even know you're alone. 
All right, go. 
May you live a long and healthy life. 
And put on your hat and gloves. 
I'm predicting snow. 
It's not going to snow. 
At most, it's gonna rain 30-year-old dudes. 
Maybe she isn't so psychic. 
Stop fighting it, Max. 
You're gonna find love and be happy, and I'm gonna be successful. 
You hear that, New York? 
I'm gonna be successful and alone! 
And robbed and raped if you keep calling that out. 
And it all started when I dropped that grant application into that mailbox that those guys are unbolting and taking away. 
What's going on? 
It's called emails. 
We're getting rid of this. 
No one mails anything anymore. 
Yes, they do. 
I did yesterday. 
And our $12,000 depends on it. 
Sorry, doll. 
This box has been out of commission for a week. 
According to a psychic, her box is gonna be out of commission forever. 
We had to tell him. 
You expect me to lie to a city employee? 
So I guess we're not getting that grant. 
The psychic was wrong. 
Maybe nothing she said is gonna come true. 
I told you, it's a scam. 
Max, look. 
It's snowing. 
And she predicted snow. 
Oh, crap! 
Am I gonna have kids? 
So she was right on snow, but not on the money. 
So what is it? 
Am I or am I not gonna die old and alone? 
Why are we even talking about this? 
We're probably not gonna make it through the winter. 
And by the way, if you die first, I am totally eating you. 
Oh. I know. 
And besides, no one person can get it all. 
You're right. 
No one person can, but what about two? 
You'll have the love and the kids and I'll have success. 
Maybe we can share, like we share our tips or that wheat thin we found in your pillowcase. 
Are you asking to bang my great love? 
Which is fine with me, because I'm already bored and sleeping with his poker buddy. 
In fact, let's switch. 
You can have my great love, and I'll die alone. 
Max, you don't want to die alone. 
I am dying to die alone. 
﻿1 Oh, my God! 
We have customers? 
What's going on? 
Why are there so many hipsters here? 
Are we selling stupid hats and telling them they're more talented than they actually are? 
No, that's already a store. 
It's called "Fedorable." 
You've been working so hard to get us customers in, I wanted to contribute by finding a way to get in the neighborhood hipsters. 
So... Here's our new flyer. 
You made up a new flyer without talking to me about it first? 
I renamed all the cupcakes after people from the '90s! 
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
We've got all your flavor flavs." 
Hipsters love '90s nostalgia more than they love pretending not to love anything. 
"Come in and lick a Beavis. 
Eat a Butt-head." 
The pistachio is now called the Dennis Rodman because it's such a dumbass flavor. 
Cute. Wait, what's going on 
over there? 
Why are all those cupcakes smashed? 
Those are the Nancy Kerrigans. 
I don't know if it's in good taste to make fun of her personal tragedy. 
 I sold eight of them. 
 Screw her, you're a genius! 
Ooh, ooh, can I name one? 
How 'bout we call the day-olds the Hugh Hefners? 
That's not '90s. 
He's in his 90s, and he's stale and hard. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Can I get a Jonathan Taylor Thomas to go and two of the Spice Girls? 
Any one but "Baby." 
Sure. 
Dude, you should come to the '90s trivia contest every Monday at the Bar Bar. 
You could win, like, big money. 
Yeah, and then I could pay for the lobotomy I'd need to forget that I ever participated in a hipster contest in a bar. 
Cute hat. 
You're very talented. 
I'm putting this flyer up in the window. 
Oh, look, there's a street performer trying to get people to dance with his marionette outside our shop. 
Uhoh, not cool! 
No hipster wants to crump with a puppet. 
See, he just chased them away. 
We'll just ask him to move, but we have to be nice. 
Nice? Nice... Oh, yeah, 
that's the thing you are to the welfare lady while your mom's in the bedroom hiding the new TV. 
Hi, how are you? 
We own this cupcake Shh! 
Not while he's dancing. 
Oh, I'm sorry, would you like me to wait? 
Oh, this dude's a serial killer. 
Uh... Oh. 
Uh... 
Do you want me to... 
Yup, total serial killer. 
Just a matter of time till we're hung on strings in his basement. 
And I probably just got puppet herpes. 
Well, I hope you enjoyed your kiss with charming Pierre. 
Now, if you wouldn't mind... 
Oh, Pierre's a prostitute? 
It's a little weird for him to do it out in the open, but if he can't afford a car, he can't afford a car. 
Oh, you're one of those a woman without wonder. 
Not true. 
In fact, I'm wondering how you manage to pay rent. 
Okay, could you two just move along? 
I have another show in five minutes. 
That was a show? 
Look, you can't do your little skits here. 
She doesn't mean to be negative. 
She's right. I was planning 
to be all positive till your doll raped her leg. 
Pierre is not a doll, okay? 
He is a marionette. 
Hand-carved by me. 
And I don't do "skits," okay? 
I received a national endowment for my work. 
What? The government 
pays for stuff like this, and I can't get my back tooth fixed? 
Well, I, for one, really appreciate the art of puppetry. 
I can tell you do, and... 
So can Pierre. 
You know, he doesn't just approach anybody. 
I'm Caroline. This is Max. 
And you are? 
My stage name is J. Petto. 
Oh, so cute. Geppetto, 
like Pinocchio's father. 
No, it's "J," period, "Petto." 
Disney owns the rights to the name Geppetto, so once again, the poor, starving artist gets screwed! 
So sad. 
Can you move? 
See, this is our cupcake shop, and you're blocking the entrance. 
Uh, this is a public space, and I know my rights. 
Showtime! 
I was trying to be nice, but you are the rudest puppeteer I've ever met. 
And I'm including Shari Lewis, who told my father to shove it on my fifth birthday! 
Let's go, Max. 
Hey... Doll man. 
You don't want to mess with us. 
I make one call to the cops, they do a background check, and I'm pretty sure you'd go from "J. Petto" 
to "J. Petto-phile." 
Miss, I dropped my David Hasselhoff. 
Well, it's not the first time he's been on the floor. 
Hey, you can't talk to me like that. 
I studied puppetry in Paris at the Palais Aah! 
Oh, my God, he slipped on David Hasselhoff! 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
I'm just a little embarrassed. 
Oh, no, no. 
I landed on Pierre! 
Pierre? 
Here, have a seat. 
Would either of you like a coffee or a free cupcake? 
No, I'm just gonna pack up and go. Thank you. 
Come back anytime for a free cupcake. 
But no need to bring your dolls. 
They're not dolls! 
I'm a man! 
It's crazy how many hipsters came into our shop today from our new flyers. 
We ran completely out of all the butterfinger Buttafuocos, the Joeys, and even the Mary Jos, which I did not think would sell. 
I reworked the smashed Nancy Kerrigans and called it the Mary Jo. 
Oh, girls, I'm so happy for you. 
You know, I remember when my business first started to take off. 
The first thing I did was to buy the little village that I grew up in and then burn it to the ground! 
I was just so angry they wouldn't let me be a cheerleader. 
No, baby, that was the movie Carrie. 
You fell asleep watching it last night. 
Oh. Yeah, I gotta stop 
watching movies late at night. 
Once, for a whole year, I thought I framed Roger Rabbit. 
I'm looking for the owners of Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
Oh, that's me. 
Wow, word is really spreading. 
How can I help you? 
You've been served. 
Max, I just got served. 
Did he go after your bangs? 
'Cause that's where I'd start. 
This is a lawsuit. 
It says, "Max's Homemade Cupcakes is being sued "for injuries sustained in our shop by Myron Shales, a.K.A. 'J. Petto.'" 
Max, it's th puppet guy. 
He's suing us? 
We should be suing him for gross... 
I don't know what the legal words are but just for being gross. 
We can't afford to be sued. 
We can't even afford the lawyer on those bus ads who has a gavel in one hand and a chicken in the other. 
I hope everything was satisfactory. 
Can I get you ladies anything else... 
Like a strong work ethic? 
Han, it's not funny. 
We're being sued. 
Okay, let me see those. 
I studied law in Korea, but I never made it through graduation. 
I realized it wasn't my passion, and I pulled out. 
Did they know it was in? 
Let's see... Uh-huh... 
Uh-huh. 
Yeah, you're being sued. 
What law school did you go to, Cal State-the-obvious? 
Did you graduate magna come rarely? 
I told you, I pulled out. 
But don't worry, accidents like this happen in stores all the time. 
That's why all businesses have insurance. 
Well, not all businesses. 
How could you not have insurance? 
You need to get protection. 
And I'm not talking about condoms. 
We're not idiots, Han. 
We had the insurance discussion. 
I was like, "Max, we need insurance." 
And she was like, "Do we have any money?" 
And I was like, "No." 
And she was like, "What are the chances something will happen?" 
And I was like, "A million to one." 
And she was like, "I like those odds. 
Let's go get gummi bears." 
And I was like, "Okay." 
But we'll talk about this at another time." 
And here we are talking about it now. 
Remember, we have no choice. 
We have to get him to drop this lawsuit. 
Okay, 3B, here. This is 
the puppet guy's apartment. 
You say puppet guy, I say serial killer. 
You say apartment, I say the brightest dot on the "Megan's law" website. 
Max, that is not charming. 
Stay on message. 
 We're charming, we're sorry... 
 We're drunk. Well, I am. 
How else do you think I'm gonna pull off charming? 
Let's just get in and out of there. 
That puppet creeped me out. 
I don't want to have to see it again. 
Oh, I am not drunk enough for this. 
I've never been drunk enough for this. 
Is J. Petto home? 
I'm kind of surprised. 
I did not think he'd have a girlfriend. 
Hello. 
Well, I hope you enjoyed meeting Yvette. 
She plays the lute, you know. 
Oh, yes, she was very charming. 
And small. She must make 
your penis look huge. 
I'm sorry? 
Charming, Max, charming. 
Hi, we just stopped by to bring you some cupcakes. 
We feel so bad about what happened. 
Can we come in for a minute? 
Um, well, I wasn't expecting company, but come in. 
We're all just hangin' out. 
Oh, oh, this isn't weird. 
This isn't weird at all. 
It's like we're in a dead body car wash. 
I had a nightmare that I had a nightmare like this once. 
Just so you know, I'm not allowed to talk about the lawsuit. 
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about how I really feel right now. 
Speaking of the lawsuit, you seem well you know, physically which is great, because the suit said you had a shattered arm and a broken hip. 
Oh, yeah, I'm not suing you for my shattered arm and hip. 
It's it's for Pierre's. 
I crushed his little body when I fell. 
He must have thrown himself under my body to protect my fall. 
Dexter, party of one. 
I have to rotate his arm and hold it every 15 minutes to get his full range of motion back. 
That's what the sling's about. 
I know he's not alive. 
Do you? 
We're very sorry for his injury, but this is absurd. 
You can't sue us because your puppet broke. 
Yes, I can. 
This puppet is my livelihood, and he's heavily insured. 
Great, the puppet has insurance, and we don't. 
 Max! 
 What? 
You don't have insurance? 
You have a business but no insurance? 
Look, we can't go to court. 
It would wreck us. 
Can we leave the lawyers out of this and come up with a more creative solution? 
I mean, you're clearly creative. 
Look, you even made a skeleton king. 
That's not a skeleton king. 
That's Pazuzu, prince of darkness. 
Let me just put this out there because we should really move things along, and also, I'm afraid. 
How much is it gonna take to make this go away? 
Do you want to take a second to consult with one of your roommates? 
I think I saw a lawyer doll. 
He is not a lawyer. 
He is a maitre d'. 
And a damn good one! 
You women just don't get it. 
This is why I broke up with my Toronto-based girlfriend over Skype. 
Right? 
$1,000 by Monday. 
But if she makes another comment about my intricate, hand-carved marionettes being dolls... 
It goes up. 
Fine, $1,000 and no strings. 
 Except for the ones on all  Max, don't say it! 
Valley Of The Dolls, Return To The Valley Of The Dolls, Chucky, Bride Of Chucky, Hello Dolly, Dollywood, and the Dalai Lama! 
Those are the things I was holding in. 
Oh, wait Doll and Oates! 
Now what? How are we gonna get 
1,000 extra dollars by Monday? 
Wait, Max, we can go to that bar and exploit your special gifts. 
If I have to strip, I have to strip. 
Not that kind of bar, the hipster trivia bar. 
Can't I just strip? 
At least I'd still have my dignity. 
It's all here. $1,000. 
So that's it. 
No more lawsuit. 
Actually, that's not it. 
As it turns out, we're gonna need 500 more. 
For what? Did your dues 
for the serial killer's union and the pedophile guild come up at the same time this year? 
Pierre's in crisis! 
But his psychiatrist could tell you more about that. 
If there's a psychiatrist in this apartment who hasn't locked him up, I don't trust his opinion. 
I'm Dr. Pangloss. 
Pierre broke more than his hip in your cupcake shop. 
He broke his spirit. 
He lost his dream! 
He no longer wants to perform. 
This is where he cuts us in half and sews my top to your bottom. 
On the plus side, we'd look amazing. 
Yeah, well, you heard it. 
Pierre's ready to give up his art, and he needs a little more money. 
Forget it, puppet nuts. 
We don't have $500. 
We don't have 500 anything. 
Well, think about it. 
That's my tea kettle. 
Yvette! 
Uhh! I'll do it. 
I'm not so sure the hostility is quite working, so why don't you go wait in the hall? 
And I'll try to talk some sense into him alone. 
You are the only person in the world who would insist on being alone with this man, but okay. 
Please just listen. 
We are broke. 
To get any more money, we'd have to strip. 
Well, Gigi and Lana started off as strippers, and now they're in the Folies Bergere, so... 
You know, even for a middle-aged puppeteer, you're a freak. 
See you in court! 
Nothing. 
He's gonna sue us, and we have no other tricks up our sleeve. 
Well, maybe not my sleeve, but how about my coat? 
 Pierre? 
 Right there. 
I'm sorry, we're not open today. 
I know you took him. 
Give me back Pierre! 
We're not open. 
We've had a terrible tragedy. 
Well, not us, but a new friend of ours had a gruesome accident, and we are just devastated. 
You wouldn't be that cruel. 
Relax, I could never be that cruel. 
But Max could. 
Well, well, well. 
Look who it is, Pierre, your lover, J. Petto! 
He's not gay. 
He had a girlfriend named Lulu. 
She was a--she was a courtesan in the court of a French king. 
They broke up over a brief flirtation she had with Yvette. 
And I know they're not alive! 
Now, what do you say we stick to the original no-strings deal? 
'Cause if you don't, Max will show you what "no strings" really means. 
Do it! Go! 
Bring it! 
I can always re-string him. 
I'm a master of my craft. 
Yes, we thought you'd say that. 
So you leave us no choice. 
Max... 
What? I 
I'm not changing my mind. 
And I'm coming back with the police. 
Oh, I wouldn't get the cops involved... 
Now that your boy here is in a... 
Compromising situation! 
How dare you! 
And she does not like the feel of a condom! 
You two are sick! 
Hey, we don't judge. 
We think whatever two consenting dolls, or maybe three consenting dolls do and it's gonna be bad 'cause he's a grower, not a shower. 
And once a few of these pics are posted online, there goes your children's party business. 
Now, call it quits, and you can delete these pics. 
Fine. Yes. Okay, you win. 
You win. You win. 
Oh, we're not falling for your word again. 
If you want your doll back For the last time, he is not a doll! 
Bring us a notarized letter saying you release Max's Homemade Cupcakes of all further legal action, and we'll give you back Pierre, perfectly intact. 
Minus his virginity, of course. 
But don't worry, you'll still have yours. 
Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can. 
Ugh, 30 years in the cutthroat world of puppets, and I'm undone by two crazy cupcake bitches! 
Did you hear that? 
30 years? 
30 years of following his dream, and he's still broke? 
Is that gonna be us, Max? 
Is our dream just as stupid as puppets? 
Sorry, Pierre, I forgot you were here. 
He's sound asleep. 
Three-ways really take it out of you. 
Here, dress her. 
She has to get a cab. 
She'd rather sleep in her own bed. 
And do you know why we're not gonna turn into him? 
Because 30 years ago, when J. Petto said, 
"I'm gonna be a puppeteer," he didn't have a best friend to tell him, "You shouldn't do that. 
It's a stupid idea." 
And unlike him, you have me to tell you when it's a stupid idea. 
And I have you to tell me not to mace myself, no matter how bad I want to know how it feels. 
So the cupcake shop isn't a stupid idea? 
No. And it's actually starting 
to take off. 
'Cause no one embraces a stupid idea like a hipster. 
But, Max, we do need insurance. 
 But do we have the money? 
 No. 
What are the chances someone else is gonna fall? 
A million to one. 
I like those odds. 
You know, this is a really cute dress. 
Forget the dress. 
Look at his cute pants. 
We really should give them to Han. 
﻿1 My new sheets from the "Under A Dollar" store feel so luxurious, like they could maybe cost over a dollar, maybe even 2 or 3. 
Yup. It was a good day 
over at the "Under A Dollar." 
Steak, bed stuff, and my new steak eatin' chair. 
Doesn't it worry you that you got that meat and furniture for the price of an Angry Birds update? 
Yeah, it worries me that it'll never happen again. 
Sheets and steak? 
Never dared to dream it. 
These sheets smell amazing too, thanks to that one little fabric softener ball, also under a dollar. 
I dated a guy with one ball once. 
He was all self-conscious, but I told him, "No big deal. 
It's just as ugly as two." 
I am going to get such a good night's Oh, sheet! 
"Thread count: Yes. 
Washing instructions: Do not wash." 
Are you sure you want to sit in that? 
Woman, don't talk to me while I'm eatin' my steak! 
"Instructions: Do not sit." 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ow. 
Yay, Root Beer Barrel! 
Ow! 
What? 
A candy trail. 
God, are you just getting to me now? 
You do work in mysterious ways. 
I'm not God, but I believe I did answer your roommate's prayers last night. 
Andy! 
So how'd this happen? 
Where'd you guys find each other again? Rematch.com? 
Empty-vajay date? 
No, last night, I thought, "Well, these sheets are already ruined, so I might as well really ruin them with sex," so I called Andy. 
And I was obviously flattered, so I came over. 
Well, I hope you guys spent more than $1 for condoms. 
 Hey, there are two things I never skimp on: Condoms and candy. 
And Max, did you see what I left over there on the kitchen counter for you? 
Condoms? Candy? 
Condoms full of candy? 
Well, now, you're going to be disappointed, because it's just candy. 
Ooh, all my favorites! 
I wonder if I can get diabetes before breakfast. 
Thanks, Andy. 
Ha ha! That candy 
was just a decoy, so you didn't see my push pop when I got out of bed. 
So... Are you and Andy 
back together? 
No. It was just 
a one-time thing. 
Look at you. 
You're like the Greek goddess of booty calls. 
Aphro-whitey. 
Kind of proud of myself. 
My very first booty call. 
Well, actually, it was a booty tweet. 
Booty's up with the times. 
Technically, booty call's been around since the old-timey times. 
Alexander Graham Bell's very first phone call was "Hey, you up?" 
Hey, so, um, I gotta go. 
Is that cool? 
Oh, super cool, sure. 
What do we do, kiss? 
High-five? 
Max, what do you do in this situation? 
I usually wave at him with my arm clenched, 'cause I'm hiding his wallet in it. 
Well, nice seeing you. 
I don't usually do the salute, but okay, that can be your thing. 
Earl, here's my last check. 
Can you tip me out? 
I have a possible booty call. 
Well, Caroline, you've reached a new place of familiarity with me. 
Unfortunately, I've not reached that same place with you. 
Can you cover my tables? 
I've been doing that since you started working here, so yes. 
Good, 'cause I'm gonna text Andy for another booty call, and maybe this time we can go out and have a booty breakfast. 
As the President of the casual sex society, local chapter, I call bull on your booty. 
What? 
It's a booty call. 
Not with you it isn't. 
You think that booty breakfast will maybe lead to a booty dinner then maybe booty engaged and booty married and have a couple booty kids and a booty retirement home and then booty die together. 
That's not true. 
He'll die before me, then I'll take a dance class. 
What are you doing? 
Do you have to pee? 
No, I feel something... 
 down there. 
Yeah, you woke it up. 
Now it's hungry. 
But you don't take it back to the same restaurant. 
What is that and why is it wearing a bow tie? 
Maybe because an actual tie would drag on the ground. 
Speaking of "dragging on the ground," maybe you could drag an antelope back to your cave and have sex with it. 
See, I have a sense of humor too. 
That's one of the attributes on my online dating profile. 
Han, are you all dressed up because you're expecting a date? 
Oh, I'm expecting a lot more than a date. 
Our profiles matched us perfectly. 
This might be the one. 
Which one? The first one? 
The only one? 
The one that accidentally steps on you? 
She was supposed to be here a half hour ago. 
Well, you know, subways run late, especially if you don't get on them because you don't really exist and are a money-scamming man in Nairobi. 
Hi, I'm looking for Han Lee, the owner. 
There she is. 
Pretty, blonde, and clearly not a man. 
Who's laughing now? 
You shouldn't jump to conclusions. 
I once had a date with a blonde woman. 
Turns out, the curtains matched the penis on that one. 
Hello. Are you Ashley? 
I'm Han Lee. 
Hi. Nice to meet you. 
I left something in my car I'll be right back. 
Is she coming back? 
Han, Jesus is coming back before she is. 
Han, you're too good for her. 
I don't understand. 
We were 97% compatible on the website. 
Let me see your profile. 
 Who's that? 
 That's me. 
No, that's the hot Asian star from Hawaii Five-0. 
What? 
We kinda look alike. 
The only thing you have in common with this guy from Hawaii Five-0 is that you are 5'0". 
And Han, "Athletic"? 
In school, I ran track. 
Running under the hurdles doesn't count as track. 
Han, this is totally lame. 
Let me help you find the right girl. 
You give me so much joy at your expense, I feel like I need to give back. 
Thank you, Max, I'm insulted and honored at the same time. 
Seeing Han and Ashley together for that one second made me realize I want to be back in a relationship. 
I'm going to text Andy. 
I knew it. I called that. 
I booty called that. 
Your casual sex card is being revoked. 
Unfortunately, Andy is still an active member, very active. 
What are you talking about? 
I'm saying he has an active member. 
He told me he's seeing someone. 
He's seeing someone? 
Actually, he's seeing a few someones. 
How many someones? 
Oh, it's back. 
Do you think this itch has anything to do with those many someones? 
Do you think he gave me something? 
Well, if he did, you just gave it to the counter. 
What did poor people do before WebMD? 
They died. 
Ooh! What is that? 
It's all red and chunky. 
I hope that's not what you have. 
Max, that's salsa. 
 But look. 
 Oh! What the hell is that? 
What the hell does Jen from New Rochelle have? 
It's a rash. 
Jen says "It was bad for awhile, then disappeared." 
So Jen came down with a case of "My father"? 
A rash. 
That doesn't sound so bad. 
I could live with a rash. 
Except Dr. Web thinks 
it might be herpes. 
Trust me, I don't have it. 
Jen's obviously a whore. 
Well, does it look like this? 
I don't know, I can't quite bend over far enough to see it. 
Fine. 
I'll look at it. 
What? No! 
What? 
Jen showed me hers. 
I'm sure mine is just a rash. 
Cathy from Colorado says, "I thought it was just a rash, but guess what? 
Rashes are always herpes." 
I can't have herpes. 
Sex is the only fun thing poor people can afford. 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, 
oh, my God, oh, my God. 
Just let me see it. 
Max, I could not continue to live here if you ever saw it. 
Well, then definitely let me see it. 
It's okay, I have one too, except mine has a "Welcome" mat. 
I know, I'll just take a picture of it. 
And that's how Kim Kardashian became famous. 
It's bad enough I'm taking a picture of my vagina, I'm doing it with an iPhone 3. 
Too dark. 
Needs a flash. 
All right, but watch out for red-eye. 
Ohh... There she is. 
Yeah, that's definitely something. 
 Let me see it. 
 Wait, it needs a filter. 
Lo-Fi, no. 
Valencia, no. 
Oh, maybe just a border. 
Just give it to me. 
Oh ho, that's not good. 
I just want to go on the record. 
It doesn't always look like that. 
It's actually quite pretty. 
Well, now it has a good personality. 
Oh, that's probably the Center for Disease Control coming to get me with their van. 
I'll get it. 
The walking helps. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. 
Hi, girls! I got Chinese food. 
You want to hang out? 
Sophie, this isn't a good time. 
Uhohh, someone's got the herp walk. 
Sophie, we don't know what it is. It could just be a rash. 
Yeah, it could, but it probably isn't. 
 Yeah, let me see. 
 Stop it. 
What? It's okay, 
I was a nurse back in Poland. 
You've heard of "Doctors Without Borders"? 
Well, we were "nurses without credentials." 
Yeah. Our motto was: 
"What? We want to help." 
Quit! Stop it! 
Max, don't show Sophie Oh, my God! 
Oh, I mean, come on, slap a filter on this thing. 
Okay. I'm done. I'm done 
with nurses without credentials or doctors without faces. 
Tomorrow, I'm going to a free clinic. 
Well, is real bad. 
You better run, don't herp walk. 
Whoa, this thing says one out of six people have herpes! 
Uh-ohh. 
Max, anyone in here could be the "one in six." 
Are you sure you don't want to get tested while we're here? 
Nah, I'm bad at tests. 
Besides, if you can't afford a doctor, it's better to just spend whatever money you got on weed to help you forget whatever you got. 
Caroline Channing. 
That's so embarrassing. 
Could she say my name any louder? 
Caroline Channing! 
 I guess she could. 
 Miss Channing, now, you wrote here the reason for your visit is an "Uncomfortable sensation in your nether regions." 
Could you be more specific? 
Is there a more private area we could discuss my private area? 
Oh, I'm sorry! 
Let me bring out my hot air balloon and we'll take a tour of the city... 
While we discuss your uncomfortable lady sensation. 
Shirley, the only lady sensation I'm seeing in this office is you. 
Oh, well, I appreciate that, girl. 
I try to lighten the load with a little humor. 
Well, I don't need the jokes. 
Thank you. 
Oh, they not for you. 
They for us. 
I need to be tested for... 
herpes. 
Girl, you sound like you're doing a perfume ad for herpes. 
Just give her the phone. 
Mm. 
Well, this is either herpes or something I ain't never seen before. 
Now, the HSV-2 is not a standard pap. 
It is a specific blood test, and it is $250. 
Well, the only way I know how to get money for that test in the next hour will probably give me an STD. 
Can we maybe work out a cheaper price? 
We're waitresses nearby at the Williamsburg diner. 
I can give you free food for as long as I work there. 
And now that I may have this, I mean, where else am I going? 
Blood test or denial? 
Blood test. 
I'll just ask Andy for a loan. 
But it's actually more of a buy, since he already ruined the property. 
Classic "You break it, you buy it." 
Hey, Max. 
Good to see you. 
I hooked up with that guy once. 
Um, do you know what he was here for and how long he's had it? 
You know what, give me one of those sexual history forms. 
This sexual history list is hard. 
Can't it just be a top ten? 
Well, Andy's not here yet. 
He's probably busy getting busy with his ragtag team of gutter skanks. 
"Gutter skanks"? 
Didn't I see them open for Cannibal Corpse? 
Look, you need to relax. 
Why don't we just get a drink, or nine? 
Two double Jack and Gingers. 
Oh, yeah, Jack. 
Number 38. 
Oh, and that Ginger. 
Number 39. 
Max, look, Jen from New Rochelle put up a new update on WebMD. 
She says her life has gotten so much better after joining a site called "His-and-Herpes." 
Hi, Andy. 
Have a seat. 
Remember, you don't know that he gave it to you, and you don't know that you have it, so be cool. 
Don't worry, Max, I got this. 
And Andy, I got that! 
Oh! 
I thought it was annoying when people took pictures of their food. 
When were you gonna tell me, Andy? 
When my vagina burst into flames and became an actual burning bush? 
Wait, that's yours? 
Worst selfie ever, right? 
Wow, I didn't recognize it. 
Was it out in the sun? 
You owe me $250 for the blood test, Andy. 
And $9 for that drink. 
Look, everybody just calm down. 
Andy, you may or may not have given her herpes. 
She may or may not be overreacting. 
I may or may not have slept with that bartender. 
He is my type, and yet, he has a job, so he's not, and he goes in the "Maybes." 
Look, Caroline, I'm really sorry, but I am totally clean. 
Since we broke up, I have only had safe sex with a special ed teacher and a dental hygienist. 
I mean, that job has "hygiene" right in the title. 
Wait, oh, there were a couple of times where I did have unsafe sex with myself. 
But only when I couldn't sleep. 
And a lot of other times. 
I will go get tested tomorrow, but please, in the meantime, try not to go to the worst-case scenario. 
I'm not going to the worst-case scenario, but if we both have it, no one else is going to want us, so we should just get married. 
"You gave me herpes, now you have to marry me." 
You want to save that gold for our wedding vows? 
Well, if you don't use it, I will. 
I can't wait till tomorrow for my test results. 
I'm going to call the clinic. 
You've left, like, ten messages. 
You're acting like the clinic's crazy ex-girlfriend. 
Well, I'm leaving another message. 
Hand me my phone. 
What? I have to stay healthy 
in case you have it. 
Someone's got to pick up your welfare checks. 
Well, this is my life now. 
Working at a diner with herpes. 
The very best I can ever hope to be is a mentor for a younger girl with herpes. 
Hi. 
Maybe you can help me. 
Well, with that smile and my bad heart, I'll die trying. 
I'm looking for the overly-emotional girl that works here as a waitress. 
Oh, my God! 
What are you doing here? 
Am I dying? 
Are you the angel of death? 
I think I found her. 
Can we have a seat for a minute? 
Max, Max, she wants to sit down. 
Come here and hold my hand. 
Oh, I'll hold your hand after I find out what you have. 
No need to be all dramatic. 
I just came to tell you that your blood test came back, but I am not allowed to give you the results without a doctor. 
You're not? 
No, I am not. 
That's a neg-a-tive, a neg-a-tive. 
Wait. Are you saying 
it's negative? 
I could not tell you that. 
I also could not tell you that it was probably an allergic reaction to soap or laundry detergent. 
Oh, my God! Max, it was 
that fabric softener ball from the "Under A Dollar" store. 
Oh! 
I'm not a cheap whore. 
I'm just poor. 
Shirley, it was really cool of you to come all the way in, because we were really very upset, so upset that a caring medical professional like you would probably help us out with something for our anxiety or parties. 
Nice try. 
But I'm not here just out of the goodness of my heart. 
I'm here for my free fries. 
I'm starving. 
I haven't been able to eat since you showed me that phone picture of your bits and pieces. 
 Fries coming right up. 
 And thank you so much. 
Oh, it's nice to give out good news. 
What about you? When can I 
give you some good news? 
I'll be in tomorrow, I'm just waiting for a call back from John Mayer. 
Hi, I'm looking for Han Lee. 
Oh, that's the girl I set up Han with. 
No visible Adam's apple. 
Go for it. 
Oh, Max, she's very pretty. 
Are you sure she'll go for me? 
I think she might. 
Let's go say hi. 
Hi, you must be Jen. 
Jen, this is Han. 
Han, this is Jen from New Rochelle. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
Jen from New Rochelle? 
Max, no! 
What? 
It could just be a reaction to her laundry detergent. 
I'm clean! 
Totally clean! 
Shirley was as surprised as I am. 
Oh, Max, I'm so happy for you. 
Yep, I dodged a bullet, but from now on, I'm going to be a little more discerning. 
I'm not 13 anymore. 
So I just texted Andy and told him it was a false alarm. 
 I didn't have it. 
 What did he say? 
He said, "Hey, you up?" 
But I'm definitely not gonna go. 
Am I? 
All right, here's the thing. 
This is about something bigger than Andy. 
Actually, Andy's quite Oh, I know. 
Came out to get a drink of water. 
Saw it, loved it. 
Look, I'm going to keep this simple. 
You are using Andy to fill a hole. 
Yes, Max, that's how sex works. 
Ever since the business closed, you've got all this free time, and you don't know what to do with yourself. 
I hear you. You're right, 
ever since the business closed, I do have a huge hole. 
I know. Came out 
to get a drink of water. 
Saw it, loved it. 
Max, I know we said we were gonna do the cupcake business again, but now we have to make it real. 
I mean, I'm a businesswoman. 
I need to have a business, or apparently, I'm gonna put someone else's business into my business. 
So Max, tomorrow, we start again, and this time, we have to give it our all. 
Clear vaginas, full hearts, can't lose. 
Hey, girls. 
I came down with a solution to your herpes problem, Caroline. 
Just don't tell anyone! 
Sophie, I don't have it. 
That's it! 
That's the way to do it! 
Problem solved. 
All right, bye-bye. 
﻿1 What's up, peanut? 
Max, I'm not paying you to just stand there. 
Well, you're not paying me to eat as many French fries as I can before the plate leaves the kitchen, but I do that too. 
Go wait on that pretty girl. 
Oh, wait. 
Is she a boy? 
She looks a little like a pretty boy. 
She's probably looking at you and thinking the same thing. 
But are you attracted to the girl she is or the boy she appears to be? 
You're confused, aren't you, Han? 
Yes, my mind tells me one thing, but my body tells me something else. 
Max, go on break. 
I've got the booth. 
Oh, no. 
You can't wait on her. 
That's Tina, a lesbian who turns straight girls. 
I call her "Tina the Turner." 
Practically every heterosexual woman in Williamsburg has hooked up with her. 
Max, everyone? 
Not me. 
Who do you think turned her? 
But you won't be able to resist her charm. Trust me. 
That's nonsense. I'm very 
comfortable with my sexuality. 
I once texted "yes" to Mr. Chaz Bono 
on Dancing With The Stars. 
Okay, good luck. 
Just don't let me catch you guys making out on the table. 
Or do. 
It's a free country. 
Hi, are you ready to order? 
Sure. I love your hair, 
by the way. 
Earl, Caroline's about to fall in love with a lesbian. 
Well, color me "I saw that one coming." 
How'd it go? 
Fine, she complimented my hair, she ordered a soup, I gave her my number. 
I gave her my number? 
Okay, hit the showers. 
That's what I get for sending a straight woman to do an emotionally dead woman's job. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  It was so nice to wake up this morning without the stress of owning our cupcake business. 
The only decision I have to make today is: Do I change my underwear or just turn these inside out? 
Four years ago, I was hit with a similar conundrum: "Do I buy underwear or do I buy beer?" 
I've been free-balling it ever since. 
Max, what are you doing? 
What's happening over there? 
Oh, you mean the arrow from the shop? 
I put it on so you'd know where the insults were coming from. 
I'm talking about the cupcakes. 
Our cupcake shop is gone. 
Why are you still making those things? 
It's the only constant in my life, and the routine distracts me from the relentless darkness that lurks in every corner of my thoughts. 
Besides, we still need to sell these at the diner to make extra money. 
Well, you can do it. 
I'm not speaking to them. 
They totally led me on. 
Those cupcakes were a tease. 
Well, I want to pay rent this month. 
And then again next month, and so on and so on until the exquisite release of death. 
Oh, rent. Here we go again. 
Does that bitch ever stop? 
If that's death, it's for me. 
Tell him to honk and I'll be right out. 
Morning, Chestnut. 
Oh, what is it about those big, beautiful eyes that makes everything feel better. 
I guess I just have a warmth. 
Oh, you mean the horse. 
Is this still good? 
It is not. 
Eh, like I have a choice. 
Wow, that was a blast from the past my old temp agency. 
Flu's got their staff laid up. 
They need bodies. 
Wanna do it? I bet 
they'll let us temp together. 
You think? You think 
they'd let us temp together? 
Oh, God. 
Last week, I owned a cupcake business, now I'm temping. 
Why don't I just ask Chestnut to kick me in the head? 
He won't do it. 
I've asked him like seven times. 
Look, we've both casually fantasized about our deaths within ten minutes of waking up, so maybe we should do something to distract us. 
And Xeroxing will make us feel whole? 
Let me tell you something. 
When you're photocopying your ass on a Xerox machine, you are never more alive. 
Hello, old friend. 
Here it is, my temping blazer. 
Ahh, you can still smell the "No way out." 
Why is that in a bucket? 
'Cause I don't want to accidentally wear it. 
Well, is there a pantsuit in the oven I could wear? 
It doesn't matter what you wear--you're a temp. 
They'll be impressed if you don't poop your pants. 
And even if you do, not a deal breaker. 
All right, I'll go, but if we're temping to make our rent, that's the last batch of those. 
I don't want to see, hear, or think any more about cupcakes. 
Ding dong, the cupcake's calling. 
We found the cupcake costumes from your store out near the dumpster. 
Are you guys drunk? 
Yes! 
Yeah, we've been out clubbing all night. 
Oh, I just swallowed one of my balls. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Well, now, you know how I feel. 
I threw those costumes away on purpose. 
Max and I are no longer making cupcakes. 
What'd you say? 
Cupcakes are a waste of time and money. 
You take that back right now! 
No, you don't You're lucky that I have a giant cake holding me back right now. 
Fifth floor, end of dreams. 
Oh, yeah, I worked here before. 
You know the toaster oven in our kitchen? 
It came from here. 
Hi. Caroline Channing, 
reporting for my first day. 
I went ahead and printed out my address, Social Security number, and other important information to make your life easier. 
Hey, I'm temp number two. 
Where your bathroom at? 
I'll get Eli. 
He's my boss. 
Sign these stating that if you're injured on the job, it's not our fault. 
How would we injure ourselves in an office? 
Let me just give you a "for instance." 
Some girl, let's say her name is Sarah, is walking through the office with her number 2 pencil facing up-ways. 
Well, she trips over her shoes and falls, and that number 2 pencil goes right through her eyeball and into her brain. 
And now she's gotta eat applesauce through a straw the rest of her life. 
See, that's not our fault, that's her fault, as per the judge's decision in Sarah Drake vs. Westship insurance. 
Sign those. 
I'll get Eli. 
Thank you. I'm sorry, 
I didn't get your name. 
That's 'cause I didn't give it to you. 
What are you doing? You never 
give anybody your real name. 
That way, when you make your little data entry mistake, they can't track the real you down. 
You didn't see me at the Enron trial, did you? 
And that light in your eyes? 
Dim it down, way down. 
Show me. 
Wow. That's actually 
really good. How'd you do that? 
 I thought about our future. 
 Great! 
Eli's in a meeting, but you gotta watch this sexual harassment video. 
Watching a video seems like a waste of time when we could be doing something more productive. 
A waste of time? Let me 
just give you a "for instance." 
There's this Dominican guy, he's installing a new water jug in the office, and he looks at one of the female employees and says, "Speaking of jugs," and then he reaches up and cups the employee's breastesses then starts twisting on the nips and what have you. 
Now, how do you handle a situation like that? 
That's actually how my longest relationship started. 
I'd love to give you that promotion, Beverly, but first, you'll have to do something... for me. 
Don't do it, Beverly! 
Don't do it! 
Spoiler alert. I've watched this 
in here before, and it does not end well for Beverly. 
Well, not to blame the victim, but who wears a black bra to work? 
These shelves would be so much better if they were alphabetized and color-coordinated. 
Forget that cabinet and look at the top shelf on Beverly. 
I'm a little jelly. 
That's right, Beverly. 
Now, bend down and pick up that file. 
Oh, Doug, you're up to your old tricks, and she falls for it every time. 
Let's pause here and write down these rules we've learned from Beverly and Doug. 
Oh, I love the smell in here. 
Reminds me of interning on Wall Street, you know, minus the dignity and the future. 
But why would the paper products be near the toner cartridges? 
Whoever organized this place must have been stupid or lazy or both. 
Aboth. 
Forget all that shelf stuff. 
You are not here to improve office layout, you're here to keep quiet, pretend like you're working, and steal five to ten vitamin waters from the break room at the end of each day. 
Hey. 
Are you watching dirty videos in here and didn't invite me? 
They're making harassment videos in 3-D now? 
I was looking for the new temps, but I think I wandered into a beauty pageant. 
Uh, the votes are in. 
It's a tie. 
I'm Eli Green, the office manager. 
You must be our new temps. 
I'm Caroline Channing. 
And I'm Carmen... Sandiego. 
No relation. 
Oh, my God, this is great! 
The cat's eating the dog's food. 
The dog's just like, "Wha-a-at?" 
Yo, psst. "Cat eats dog food." 
YouTube it now. 
Kinda busy with my work. 
It's called "Minimum Wage" 'cause you're supposed to do the minimum. 
Mmm. Coffee tastes 
so much better when it's from today and you haven't paid for it. 
The dog's just like, "Wha-a-at"" classic. 
You like that video? 
Look up "Cat vs. Toddler." 
You're welcome. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Is this a modeling agency? 
Did I get off on the wrong floor? 
I don't care where you get off as long as it's not here. 
Hi, Eli. So any idea 
when they'll decide who's getting the junior executive promotion, or Not yet, but I did just mention your name  to the big guys, Ryan. 
 I'm Leon. 
Hey, Caroline. 
Hi. Question: 
I already finished the first quarter claim reports... 
Are you doping? 
We need to stretch this out. 
And since I had time, I took the liberty of reformatting the expense template, so what would you like me to do now, Eli? 
Say my name, say my name. 
Hey, Caroline, you're not just hot, you're on fire over there. 
You should be throwing your hat in the ring for that executive job. 
Really? 
And this girl's just like, "Wha-a-at?" 
That temp place is soul-sucking, and I didn't even know I had a soul to suck. 
If that's a suicide note, just add my name to the end. 
Come on, it's not that bad, and I got four free fresh coffee drinks, and one had a caramel drizzle. 
Caramel drizzle? 
That's definitely my name at my next temp job. 
I don't know if this is such a temp job. 
I'm filling out this application to apply for that junior executive position. 
Oh, no, you're not. 
We're only going back one more time to get enough Wite-Out to do the Kim Kardashian white manicure. 
Max, you saw me there today. 
I'm good at this, and it felt amazing to be working somewhere where my skills are valued and supported. 
Oh! Are you not feeling 
supported here? 
I'm sorry, I'm a boss, not a bra. 
Should I praise you more? 
Really killing it with the leaning on the counter doing nothing. 
Kudos, Caroline. 
Huzzah. 
Hey, where's my "huzzah"? 
I was standing around doing nothing too. 
And don't forget about me. 
I was sitting around doing nothing. 
In Korea, you all would be left on the curb and taken away with the garbage. 
Is that how you got to America, Han? 
Earl, Caroline's being an idiot. 
Oh, are we doing this in front of her now? 
Hey, would you still apply for that job if I told you we sold out of the cupcakes tonight? 
Last one. 
Oh, so what, they're good one day and you want me to take them back? 
Who am I, Robert Pattinson? 
So you just cut lil' coconut here out of your life? 
That's cold. 
Max, this job offers medical benefits. 
There are doctors who don't have medical benefits. 
And financial security. 
Maybe I want to wake up every morning not wanting to kill myself. 
Well, that's weird, but whatever. 
I went to Wharton. 
Pay attention, everyone. 
I know you're all very busy working hard Congratulations,  you've just won a free iPad. 
 What theI don't know Attention, everyone! 
While doing work and nothing but work, I may have downloaded a virus that meows, so be on the lookout. 
Carry on, Eli. 
Thank you, Carmen. 
Happy to say, tenth floor has finally picked our new junior exec, and that person is sitting right here. 
 Yes! 
 No, Caroline. 
 Yes! 
 No! 
Champagne on me! 
Yes! 
Here, I got us a fresh bottle, 'cause I'm the boss. 
Miss Black, would you pop that cork for me? 
I'd be happy to, Miss Channing, you bitch. 
Ooh! 
Okay. 
Okay, okay, now I'm gonna make a proper toast. 
I don't know how. 
Their toaster oven's in our kitchen. 
To Max--I promise not to sexually harass you no matter how much I'm required to as your superior. 
To Caroline I cannot promise the same thing, 'cause sister, you fine. 
Oh, crap! I spilled champagne 
on my good bucket blazer. 
Yes, right there on your breasts, Beverly. 
I'm doing Doug from the sexual harassment video. 
The Doug? 
Love your harassment work! 
Especially that sad H.R. scene 
where you get fired and cry but still manage to touch yourself a little. 
Wow, Beverly, your breasts are so big, I might need the whole box. 
That's enough. You're making 
this rag feel even dirtier. 
 Hey, hand me that. 
 What? 
 My new Westship Company poncho? 
 Yep. 
Now it's my booze bib. 
Oh, I love this. 
Somehow it's small enough to fit in your purse, but large enough to sleep under during an "Occupy Wall Street"-type situation. 
Max, I'm pouring you more champagne because I have something really exciting I want to tell you. 
I talked to Eli about hiring you full-time. 
You are now a junior executive's executive assistant! 
I will knock you to the ground! 
Max, think about it. 
It comes with health care. 
You wouldn't have to decide between birth control pills and morning-after pills. 
Are you trying to take away a woman's right to choose? 
Come on, it could be so fun. 
Coming to work together, getting free coffee the good kind, the blended kind not to mention Xeroxing our asses and feeling more alive than ever. 
Watch, I'll show you what a fun boss I can be. 
Let's Xerox our asses. 
Well, how could I say no to copying my butt? 
The only thing better than one of my butts is two of my butts. 
 I'll go first. 
 Too late! 
Do you want legal size paper or three-hole punch? 
Three-hole punch? That's how 
my longest relationship ended. 
Ready, you corporate sell-out. 
Fry me. 
Hey, why is it still flashing? 
Whoops! I put in 100 copies 
instead of one. 
Don't worry about it, we'll use them as Christmas cards. 
See? That's why 
I need an assistant. 
Thanks, but I'm not gonna take this stupid corporate job. 
I'm gonna stick with cupcakes, even though you just quit. 
I didn't quit the cupcake business. 
If you remember, it quit us. 
At least this job makes sense. 
You get a regular paycheck, benefits. 
You don't spend two whole years of your life giving it everything, and then walk away feeling like a failure. 
Get off that now. 
I'm worried you're giving yourself butt cancer. 
Wait, you think you're a failure? 
'Cause I think we did amazing. 
The shop closed, Max. 
Our dream blew up in our face. 
Lots of things blow up in your face. 
It's part of being a woman. 
You just... 
Towel off and keep going. 
You're really going to do this? 
This was just supposed to be a temporary distraction till we got back to the cupcake thing. 
No, Max. 
Cupcakes were the temp job. 
No, cupcakes were our dream. 
Well, I was wrong. 
Maybe it's better not to have a dream. 
Good morning, everyone. 
Eli, they said you wanted to see me in here? 
Ms. Channing, my name 
is Michelle Yi, I'm with H.R. 
Aw! Is this 
my official welcome? 
Oh, hello. 
Well, here, I brought some first-day bagels and plain cream cheese. 
Sometimes chives can be a little breathy, am I right? 
Is this the woman who sexually harassed you? 
Yup, that's her. 
Oh, good one! 
Really funny. 
Me harassing you? 
Come on, you're not even my type. 
Caroline, this isn't a joke. 
Trust me, I've been through four of these. 
Wait, what's going on? 
Ms. Channing, please 
don't address Carmen directly. 
 Max. 
 "Max"? 
Is that a pet name she has for you, Carmen? 
Yes. She also calls me 
"Caramel Drizzle." 
Can you tell me what exactly happened with Ms. Channing 
last night? 
She fondled my breasts. 
Ms. Yi, 
it's not how it sounds. 
We were drinking, and I was pretending to be a man. 
"Drinking." 
"Pretending to be a man." 
Don't write that down. 
Don't write that down. 
And Carmen, when Ms. Channing touched you, 
how did that make you feel? 
Dirty. 
Dirty and underpaid. 
She felt dirty? 
Come on, Ms. Yi, 
you don't know her. 
She's the dirty girl. 
She is a dirty, dirty girl. 
And does that turn you on? 
No! It's almost impossible 
to turn me on. 
Oh, good. 
Now I don't feel so bad. 
Trust me, she's making this stuff up. 
I'm sorry, Ms. Channing. 
We're gonna have to terminate your employment. 
This is outrageous! 
Nothing she said ever happened. 
Then how do you explain this? 
That is a copy from a Xerox machine badly in need of toner, which is just one of the many oversights that would not have continued had I been made an executive here. Good day. 
I don't know what she's talking about. 
That butt couldn't be any toner. 
Write that down, write that down. 
Can I get a peek at that? 
How are you tonight, Caroline? 
Angry, frustrated, humiliated. 
Just another Tuesday at the diner. 
Hello, Carmen. 
Or is it "Caramel Drizzle?" 
Just so you know, that stunt will go on my professional work record. 
Oh, please. 
This diner's on your professional work record. 
And your record's clean. 
Eli expunged it because I gave him a couple of my ass Xeroxes. 
He's laminating them and using them as place mats. 
My idea. 
For what, Max? 
Why'd you get me fired? 
Why'd I get you fired? 
Well, let me give you a "for instance." 
I once knew this girl who was so used to not failing that the first time she did, she got so scared, she forgot who she was and tried to be somebody else, and then she touched my breastesses. 
Look, it's cool if you don't want to join in on the cupcake dream, but at least wait till you find another. 
Don't hop on the first one that comes along. 
It's a dream, not a man. 
See? 
You are a dirty girl. 
I'm a dirty, dirty girl. 
Hey, cupcake quitters. 
Look, do you see what you've driven me to? 
Supermarket cakes. 
Sophie, you don't need to eat those. 
You can have one of ours. 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes is back in business. 
It would be cruel to kid me. 
Nope. We're doing it 
differently this time. 
We are? How? 
I have no idea. 
But for starters, you're my new junior executive executive's assistant. 
I will knock you to the ground. 
Mmm. Ohh. Yeah. 
Well, Mama happy now. 
﻿1 This is it, Max. 
The first private party we've booked in our cupcake shop. 
What? 
You said it was a private party, and this is a party I  keep near my privates. 
Fine, but they can't smell it on your breath, So eat a mint after. 
No need. 
It's peppermint Schnapps, 'cause I think ahead. 
I think this calls for a "First party" dance. 
 First par-tay  who gonna have a first par-tay?  
 we gon' have a first par-tay  That's the exact same dance you did When the Humane Society sent you free puppy address labels. 
 Address labels  Who got doggies on an envelope?  
 who got doggies on an envelope?  
 I need another sip of this   wish I had something stronger  Max, I'm sorry. 
I can't help it. 
I'm just so excited my genius marketing ideas are finally starting to pay off. 
Quiet! Quiet! 
Quiet! Quiet! 
If you aren't listening, Cupcake Max can't teach you how to decorate. 
It's weird how sex is so great, and yet, it makes these. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ho ho ho! 
Talking to you, Max. 
I know. 
What's up, Andy? 
I brought some Christmas candy from my shop for the diner. 
Oh. 
Look, Max, Santa did come. 
From just a kiss? 
Well, you didn't see what she was doing with her hands. 
I taught her that. 
That's my gift to you. 
Merry Christmas. 
Hey, is everything okay with your shop? 
'Cause the landlord came into my store today and mentioned you guys hadn't paid your rent. 
If there's a problem, I'd be more than happy to help. 
Well, the fact is, we just don't have Don't have a clue why our online payments just never go through. 
Technology, right? 
You used to be able to shake the mailman's hand. 
Now it's all holograms and lasers. 
Grandma's right, those were the days. 
It was a more honest time. 
Okay. Well, I gotta go. 
A kiss for Caroline. 
Oh, that was a new kind of kiss. 
I liked it. 
Max taught me. 
What's with the lies? 
Just tell him the truth. 
We can't pay our rent, life sucks, and you need wine before oral. 
No need. 
We still have two other private parties set up for this month: The Quinceanera for that pregnant girl, and then her baby shower. 
Plus, the holidays are coming, so we should get our decorations up asap, or Santa won't know where to find us. 
Oh, he'll know where to find us. 
We'll be the two evicted girls eating fruitcake out of a Dumpster. 
Oh, look, here comes one of the reindeers now. 
You look like a Korean coat rack. 
Everybody can stop looking. 
We found the Grinch. 
No wonder it's so angry, it's working for minimum wage. 
Oh, you're hanging the Christmas decorations. 
I already put up the mistletoe. 
Where? 
Let's just say it's very well-hung. 
Well, all my checks are in, so I have to run and make a cupcake delivery. 
Here, take this and put it in the till. 
I did a cupcake run last night too. 
Wait, who orders cupcakes at 2:00 a.m.? 
Um, my friends. 
You don't have any friends. 
I have so many friends. 
Who are your friends? 
Some people I know. 
Then how come I've never met them? 
Well, they don't like you. 
But they don't know me. 
They don't like what they've heard about you. 
But who would they have heard things from but you? 
Maybe from my other group of friends. 
They don't like you either. 
Later. 
Max, you can turn around. 
That's right, I followed you. 
Sorry for following you. 
It's just, you have the hair and jacket of a woman. 
In a good way. 
Did you actually think that was me? 
My beard is much thicker. 
Well, where are we going? 
Why are we in this seedy building that smells like marijuana? 
Oh, my God, is this where your mom lives? 
You think my mom lives indoors? 
Okay, look, for the last few nights, my dealer calls me after she sells pot to people, and then I sell those people the munchies they need. 
Max, this is New York. 
That's illegal! 
No, giant sodas are illegal. 
This is me selling cupcakes to make our rent. 
And besides, it's not a big deal. 
Pot's legal in Washington, Massachusetts, Colorado, and California. 
Well, thank you for the stoner's summary of the last election, but we don't live in any of those places, and I do not approve of pot at all. 
It makes people lazy and lethargic, and drains all one's ambitions. 
God, you're fun. 
Look, on the other side of this door is money to help us make the $600 more we need for rent. 
It's totally up to you. 
Should I knock, or not knock? 
What's good, Max? 
Hey, Keefer. 
This is my friend Caroline. 
Pleasure, my goddess. 
Come on in. 
I just broke out some dank nugs. 
Oh, thanks, but we actually just had some dank nugs. 
First of all, that's your new nickname, and, Keefer, I don't want to rush you, but me and dank nugs have to get home. 
Okay, cool, I'll be right back with the cash. 
Second-hand smoke, second-hand smoke. 
Second-hand nerd, second-hand nerd. 
Here you go, they were feeling kinda generous. 
Nice to meet you, nugs. 
Nice meeting you too. 
Peace. 
There. 
A hundred bucks. 
Oh, my God, Max, that's a hundred-dollar bill! 
How easy was that? 
And we didn't even have to open the shop. 
I mean, what is the problem with doing this? 
You're right, I overreacted. 
We're not selling pot. 
We're selling cupcakes. 
We didn't break any laws. 
There's nothing illegal about it. 
Move! Move! Move! 
I didn't know! 
I didn't know! 
Go! Go! Go! 
Keep going, now! 
 Police! 
 Go! Go, now! 
Put the meth down! 
Put the meth down! 
'Sup? 
Move! Go! Go! 
Get him out! Let's go! 
Bring him out! 
Go! Go! Go! 
I told you not to get involved with drugs! 
I told you! 
 Shut it, Carol! Shut it! 
 Oh! 
I can't believe that just happened. 
I know, it's like, "let it go, Carol." 
We're done with drugs. 
I was right. 
And now you know why my friends don't like you. 
And remember, we do private parties, wedding parties, birthday parties All right, there's a dozen. 
What's the special occasion? 
My cat died. 
We also do funerals, divorces... 
And sad Friday nights alone. 
Thank you. 
Okay, so that's 48 more dollars. 
Now, all we need is For 72 more cats to die. 
Max, there's no need to kill imaginary cats. 
Let's just send out positive energy, and the universe will provide. 
Swing and a miss, universe. 
Surprise! 
I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by and say hello. 
Under any other circumstance, I'd say, "never do that again," but today, I'm saying, "how many cupcakes do you want"" and I'm thinking of a number between 10 and 20. 
I'm kind of trying to watch my waist. 
Well, you're closer to it than most people. 
I'm gonna start you with 12 cupcakes. 
Full price, 'cause you're family. 
Oh, my God! 
The phone ringing and a customer at the same time? 
See, Max, it's all happening. 
Between the money we just got last night and that pregnant girl's Quinceanera / Baby shower, we're gonna make our rent. 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
Oh, hola, Estella. 
Si, the Quinceanera / Baby shower. 
Que? 
Oh, no. 
Deported? 
Oh, you can't afford it. 
My mal. 
Well, sorry, it didn't work out. 
Gracias for calling. 
Well, that's disappointing, but we should have seen it coming. 
She couldn't afford condoms either. 
It's cool. 
I'll just call Keefer and try to do a couple more cupcake runs. 
No, that's not cool, that's dangerous. 
It'll all work out. 
You know what? 
I'm just gonna go over and ask Andy if he'll float us some cash till the holiday rush kicks in. 
He did offer. 
We should put up some Christmas lights, a menorah for Chanukah, and for Kwanzaa... 
While I'm gone, why don't you Wikipedia Kwanzaa? 
Well... 
Here's the first eight. 
And how many cupcakes would you like "to go"? 
I'm thinking of a number between 40 and 50. 
How come you never push the food at the diner like this? 
Oh, that's where I know you from. 
Start eating. 
I didn't do it. 
It's so not hot. 
He's my boyfriend. 
I mean, it's not like borrowing money from family. 
You don't sleep with your family. 
Not all families are the same, Caroline. 
Besides, we're fine. 
The universe will provide. 
Well, the universe better provide in, like, a second, 'cause look, there's the landlord. 
He just went into that Moroccan place. 
What are we gonna do? 
 Hide! 
 What? 
Well, I should go. 
It's too late for that! 
Lock the door, hit the lights, and crawl over here, and stay low! 
Stay down till we're out of sight. 
Ow! 
Ow. Ow, it hurts! 
Oh, please. 
Like this is the first time you've been on your knees in the bathroom. 
Caroline, you don't have to stay on the ground anymore. 
I feel like this is where I belong now. 
Yo, Baker girls. 
Max, he's in the shop. 
 Okay, go, out the window. 
 Really? 
If he can't see us, he can't evict us. 
Go. 
It's a little high. 
Are you sure? 
You've heard "When God closes a door, he opens a window"? 
He's running from his landlord. 
Go. 
Okay, here goes. 
I love you, Max. 
What about me? 
What should I do? 
Put the money for those cupcakes on the counter. 
Who are you? 
Uh... 
No hablo ingles? 
All right, all right, good news. 
I just found $3 in my pocket. 
Oh, and a peanut M&M, so we don't have to spend money on dinner. 
Caroline, why are you putting it off? 
You know what you have to do. 
Go over to the couch and put your hands in that crack. 
It's every poor girl's rite of passage. 
Oh! 
What? 
I think something just licked me. 
I'll just check our purses. 
Here's yours. 
Uh, no, no, no. 
I already checked that. 
There's nothing in mine... 
Except that baggie of pot that Keefer gave me as a Christmas present. 
Max, this is not a Christmas present. 
This is a giant, illegal, fat sack of weed. 
Yeah, with a Rudolph sticker, which makes it a Christmas present. 
See? 
His nose and his eyes are red. 
I want this out of my sight. 
You gotta get rid of it. 
Well, it's gonna take me at least 45 minutes to smoke all that. 
Max, I'm serious, I'm not comfortable with that fat sack of weed. 
Stop saying "fat sack of weed." 
You're like someone's dad overusing the word "awesome." 
I'll just put it up here, next to the half a Vicodin I was saving for new year's. 
Oh, no! 
The pot! 
The pot is in the pot! 
It's in the butter I was using to make cupcakes. 
Maybe this is the universe's way of telling you to stop doing drugs. 
Or is it telling us to sell them? 
Max, we are not that desperate. 
We're not making pot cupcakes. 
I'd rather just see what the holidays bring. 
Well, this isn't Bethlehem, it's Brooklyn. 
There's no frankincense and myrrh, there's only frankenberry and "myrrh-ajuana." 
These turned out great! 
Good idea, universe. 
I knew you smoked weed. 
Oh, my God. 
I can't believe the smell. 
It's like a skunk skunked a skunk. 
I know. 
It's like a port-a-potty on the last day of Coachella. 
Oh, no, Chestnut's smelling this. 
I got my horse stoned. 
Oh, relax. 
He's just trying to fit in at school. 
Do you think the neighbors can smell it? 
Do you think they're gonna call the cops? 
Chill out! 
How can someone be this paranoid before they're high? 
Here, taste this. 
Max, I don't do pot. 
I tried it a couple times in college. 
It totally changed my personality. 
Then please have some pot right now. 
Come on, it's business. 
I need you to taste it and tell me how it is, 'cause I can't tell. 
At this point, everything I put in my mouth tastes like pot. 
Hey, it's pretty good. 
In fact, it's kind of delicious. 
We should charge 15 apiece for these. 
That's $540. 
That's our rent. 
A few more bites of that cupcake, and that math would've taken two hours longer. 
Oh, my God! 
It's the cops! 
It's probably that same SWAT team! 
I told you not to get involved with drugs! 
I told you! 
Shut it, Caroline! 
Shut it! 
Relax, it's Sophie. 
Hi, girls. 
I got my period. 
Yeah, I got killer cramps. 
It's like I got a tractor in my uterus. 
Sophie, we're sorry you're not feeling well. 
Yeah, you know, it's times like these I think God's a bitch. 
Ugh! 
Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
What's that smell? 
Nothing. 
It's nothing. 
Maui wowie! 
Oh, you girls have been holding out on me! 
Oh! 
All right! Okay! 
This is what I'm talking about! 
Oh, my God, good-bye, killer cramps! 
Hello, pot party! 
I am picking up what you are laying down. 
Mmm! 
I think we found our new product spokesperson. 
Here it is. 
I've been here once before with Keefer. 
Judah's a really chill guy, kind of a tech genius. 
Think we can probably sell them all here. 
Are you okay? 
You haven't spoken the entire way over here, which is either a side effect of the pot, or my early Christmas present. 
No, I'm fine. 
I feel exactly the same. 
It hasn't changed me at all. 
Ooh! 
Careful with the box, 'cause you're smearing the cupcakes. 
Oh, what does it matter? 
We're all gonna die. 
Is this that other personality you were telling me about? 
No, it's still me. 
Not that I matter. 
None of us do. 
We're all gonna die. 
Oh, crap. 
Hey, Max! 
I was so happy that you called. 
And we're so happy you're addicted to marijuana. 
You know it always leads to heroin Which leads to death. 
We get it. 
You're the one not-fun stoner. 
Hey, guys, the chicks are here with the edibles. 
 Edibles! 
 We're having a little bit of a celebration. 
Okay, so cupcakes. 
They're 15 apiece, good quality. 
And guys, we have to sell all of them, or tomorrow, we'll be eating out of a Dumpster. 
Does anyone have any uppers? 
I have to sit down. 
I mean, life. Ugh! 
I'm so tired of pretending it's all gonna be okay. 
It's not. 
You should get that mole checked out. 
I don't feel good about it. 
Dude, this chick is freaking me out. 
Just take it easy, Dave. 
We'll just get some food in her. 
I got a buddy on the way with pizza. 
Guys, I'm sorry about her. 
It's like bringing your mother to a strip club. 
Not for me. That'd be like 
taking my mom to work. 
Strippers, how about their lives? 
They got no way out. 
Can I talk to you, before you start performing an acoustic ballad about strippers with moles? 
What's the point, Max? 
Go, if you're gonna hit me, hit me. 
What is happening with you? 
I didn't even know blonde people could be sad. 
Max, I have to tell you something. 
Come here. 
It's a secret. Come here. 
We're not gonna make it. 
But you're the one who's always telling me everything's gonna be fine. 
Yeah, I was lying. 
Where's the weed, homeslizzy? 
Perfect timing, Andy. 
These are the girls who are selling edibles. 
No, that's my girlfriend, Caroline. 
That sucks for you, dude. 
What are you doing here? 
She is really getting the hang of that. 
And around 4:00 a.m., 
you finally called me from an IHOP in Greenpoint, and I came and picked you up. 
You were covered in syrup, yelling, "the Mayans were right! 
The Mayans were right!" 
There's my little stoner. 
Andy, I don't get stoned. 
It was just last night. 
I know. 
You told me all about it when you called at 4:00 a.m. 
Sorry, and I'm mortified to ask, but did you and I have phone sex? 
That was you and me. 
Stoned Caroline's got game. 
Hey, Max told me about the rent. 
Why didn't you tell me you guys needed help? 
I guess I just didn't want to have to admit to you or to myself that we're in real trouble. 
Plus, being a charity instead of a girlfriend is so not hot. 
Uh, there is nothing you can do that is not hot. 
Oh, then whatever you do, do not look at the video Max has of me, rolling around in the IHOP parking lot, covered in syrup. 
I want you to have this. 
Cash it, don't cash it. 
Do whatever you want, but just know that my success doesn't mean anything if I can't share it with you. 
Thank you. 
Andy, that is so amazing, and I really appreciate it, but I can't take it. 
Well, it's a win-win. 
At least it got your hand in my pants. 
And remember, if you ever need it, it's there. 
I'm talking about my penis. 
Andy offered to pay our rent, but I said no. 
That is the whitest thing I've ever heard. 
It was really sweet of him, but I didn't want to take money from a man I'm sleeping with. 
Wait, are you telling me there are women who don't take money from men they're sleeping with? 
What's gonna happen, Max? 
I don't know. 
But we do have Christmas decorations, so let's put them up. 
Wait a minute. 
You're the one pushing Christmas? 
Who are you, me? 
No, I still have my dignity. 
Speaking of Christmas, here are the 21/2 wise men. 
 What's up? 
 Caroline called me last night. 
Told me that you two couldn't pay your rent, that you were losing the shop. 
That girl can talk. 
She called me too, and said you didn't have your rent, and also that, for sure, the rising waters of the ocean will swallow us and kill us all. 
So we put together what we had, and... here. 
Consider it an early Christmas gift from all three of us... 
Even though I gave 350, Earl gave 100, and he gave 50. 
Thank you, but we can't take it. 
Yes, you can. 
We're family. 
500 whole dollars? 
Thank you, guys. 
And we have something special for you. 
What makes it special? 
The love she puts into 'em, man. 
You can smell the love all around her. 
Mmm. 
You know, Max, I think we're gonna make it. 
I like not-stoned Caroline. 
We're gonna keep you off the drugs. 
You mean because I'm more positive? 
No, 'cause we may have to sell your urine for next month's rent, and I'm gonna need that pee clean. 
Mmm, so good. 
﻿1 Well, you, me, and the cupcakes are ready, now, we just need people. 
Ooh, here we go! 
This one looks like she might come in. 
Yeah, keep walking, ugly! 
Ugly? 
She's like a supermodel. 
Did she come in and buy something? 
 No. 
 Then, she ugly. 
Okay, yes, business is slow, but we don't have to drop to that level. 
Ooh, this guy is definitely coming in. 
Keep walking, fatty! 
And he ugly. 
Both: Welcome to Max's homemade cupcakes! 
Hello. 
How much are your cupcakes? 
$4. 
No. 
Both: Whore. 
Jinx, you owe me a coke! 
We both called an old lady a whore. 
I know! 
That is so good for business. 
I'll give you $3. 
I'm sorry, they're $4. 
There's no one in here. 
You'll take what you get. 
I'm in love with that whore. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Hello. I'm calling 
from Max's Homemade Cupcakes to acquaint you with our new "Mornings with Max's" special. 
No, sir, that is not what our special is. 
And I haven't even done that with my boyfriend yet, so don't be rude. 
Give me that phone. 
Ya fat, ya ugly, ya fugly. 
Max, we have got to get more business going. 
The money Sophie gave us to open the shop will only cover next month's rent. 
Wait, we already have next month's rent? 
Why are we worried? 
We're doing better than everyone else in America. 
Well, well, well, if it isn't Prince Charming. 
But, Earl, is Prince Charming, or is he just a diva in purple? 
So psyched. Finally got 
a personalized hello from Earl. 
He called me Prince Charming. 
I'm in, baby, I am in. 
I wouldn't get too excited. 
He probably just forgot your name. 
He calls every Puerto Rican guy that comes in here "La Bamba." 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
 Yes, I'll hold. 
  Of course we do sugar-free and gluten-free. 
I'll be right back, I just gotta take this call. 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, I understand, 
but, like, how diabetic? 
I feel a little sick to my stomach. 
Why? You haven't even 
eaten here yet. 
No, I'm nervous. 
I came here to tell Caroline something kind of big. 
What? You have 
a secret family on Long Island? 
 No. 
 You have HepC? "D"? 
 One of the new heps? 
 No. 
I don't have any of the heps. 
Wow. Now, telling her 
I'm in love with her is just going to sound boring. 
You're gonna tell her you love her? 
Here in the diner? 
Why, was the dump closed? 
Hey, we need more coffee, La Bamba. 
Andy, this isn't where you tell someone "I love you." 
This is where you tell someone their sex change looks passable. 
What's the big deal? 
If I feel it, why shouldn't I say it? 
I think she'd be all over that. 
Nope. If it didn't happen 
to Kate Hudson in some stupid romantic comedy, then it won't work for Caroline. 
Sorry, what? I left 
and went into another theater in my mind while you were talking. 
I know, it's so creepy, but she likes it. 
Really, if you could arrange for it to rain, or run after her to the airport in the rain, but somehow end up on top of the Empire State building on Valentine's Day, that'd be best. 
Well, I just sold three dozen cupcakes, we just have to mark "No sugar" on one of the boxes. 
So what did you want to say to me? 
No, nothing, just came by to say hi. 
I gotta go download a couple movies. 
Hey, Oleg. 
Where's my food? 
Cheeseburger with fries, pick-up. 
Han, you look so tall in the window. 
Tell me the truth, are you standing on another tiny person? 
No. 
On the box. 
Oleg had to leave. 
Sophie came back from her trip to Poland, and he's worried, 'cause she's very, very depressed. 
Why, did she see you in that hair net? 
Come on, listen, when Sophie went to see her new house, there was no house. 
Her Polish contractor ripped off her money. 
Poor Sophie. 
I feel terrible. 
I know what it feels like to be ripped off. 
I once bought a Fendi purse, but when I looked inside, it said "Rendi." 
What kind of god would let that happen? 
Max, I went to a party with that. 
We should stop by after work, see how she is, and bring her some of her favorite cupcakes. 
Or you could give her that $20,000 she loaned you. 
Loaned us? Sophie gave us 
that money as a gift. 
Not what I hear. 
Pick-up! 
And we're out of spaghetti. 
There's no sauce. 
No, Han, there's plenty of sauce. 
 I know, but I can't reach the shelf. 
Hey, are we sure that money Sophie gave us was a gift? 
Yes. She gave it to us 
to support our dream. 
I know when I had money, I gave it out freely, and never expected anything in return. 
Like when I gave my maid that gorgeous Rendi. 
Well, I don't know about people not expecting stuff back. 
One time, a guy bought me a slushy, and for the next three weeks, he owned me. 
No, he really owned me. 
Eight days in, I almost got traded to a trucker. 
And I wouldn't even mention her gift. 
It will only insult her, and I promise, nobody is expecting us to give the money back. 
Come in, girls. 
Did you bring the check? 
No, because it was a gift a big-ass gift, but we brought our love and we brought cupcakes. 
Well, I doubt she'll eat them. 
She hasn't even touched her kapusniak, which is the dish traditionally served to Polish women who have been wronged by their contractors. 
Such a specific culture. 
But that's not the worst thing. 
She is so depressed, no sex, which is big problem for me, because I find depressed women very hot. 
A lot of guys do. 
Why do you think I haven't paid for a drink in six years? 
I'll go in and tell her you're here. 
She's just lying there on the bed, lifeless, hot... 
The big tease. 
Sophie, the two girls who you loaned the money to are here to see you. 
It was a gift. 
A generous, generous gift, but still a gift. 
Are we sure about that? 
'Cause I was slushy boy's bitch for three weeks, and I did things. 
Look, Max brought you cupcakes, your favorite: Vanilla with a bacon fat drizzle. 
No, I can't eat when I've been betrayed. 
What kind again? 
Sophie, I am patient man, but I am also horny man. 
Any idea when you will snap out of this? 
Oh, why don't you just unzip and climb on top of me now and get it over with? 
 Oh, no. 
 Well, we should be going. 
No, girls, stay. 
If she's not even going to put up a fight, what's the fun? 
Are you sure? 
Bacon drizzle, little bit of heaven. 
No, I don't want them. 
Okay, let's put the cupcakes here, in case you change your mind. 
 Is this a gun? 
 Ooh! 
Yes. I'm not going to 
stab myself to death. 
Do you know how much this outfit costs? 
Sophie, you're going to get through this. 
And by the way, you look amazing in black. 
Oh, well, no more bright colors for me now. 
I'm in mourning. 
See? 
Black bra, black garters, and look, black panties. 
Um, you're not wearing any panties. 
I'm not? 
Oh. 
I'm sorry about that wild mess down there. 
Sophie, I feel bad you got ripped off. 
Here are all my tips from tonight: $27. 
For eight hours? 
Oh, now, I'm depressed for you. 
You want to borrow my gun? 
You know what? I think 
you just need to eat something, and pretty soon, you'll be back to your old self: A woman who gives gifts and expects nothing in return, 'cause that's what a gift is. 
Sophie, is that doing anything for you? 
Yeah, well, I'm not hating it. 
Here, this soup smells amazing. 
Oh, no. I don't have 
the energy to eat. 
Sophie, open your mouth and put this in. 
Oh, come on. 
Now you're as bad as Oleg. 
There. Better? 
That's cold. 
Sophie, just say the word, and I will rob a bank for you. 
Sophie, I understand you're hurting, but we've already spent most of the money on the shop, and business just isn't good. 
It's not the money. 
Everybody thinks it's the money. 
It's more than that. 
My lake house was my dream, and I lost my dream. 
Oh, thank God! 
Well, I'm glad that's cleared up. 
Not about the money. 
Max, come on, she's had a shock, we should let her sleep. 
You girls are so lucky. 
You still have your dream. 
Well, Sophie, what if you were part of our dream? 
I'm sorry? 
Whose dream? 
Our dream. 
Your dream? 
Where's that cupcake? 
Look, Sophie's the only reason we have a shop. 
We should make her, like, a partner. 
Mmm! Partner! 
But you and I are already partners. 
I feel like we're kind of partnered out. 
What about a silent partner? 
Mmm! Silent partner! 
Yeah, I like that. 
Mmm! I'm getting 
my appetite back, and also, my sex drive. 
Go or stay, girls. 
Either way, I'm going in. 
I'm sorry I said Sophie could be part of the store. 
I just felt bad for her, lying there, all in black, too sad to even make her junk pretty. 
It's fine. "Silent partner" is 
just a figurehead role anyway, and it's nice to know you have such a big heart. 
It's not my heart. 
What I saw down there changed me. 
It looks like something an animal built to live in for the winter. 
Wait, what is Sophie's chandelier doing here? 
Is this the Polish version of a home invasion? 
They break in and leave something tacky? 
Good morning, partners. 
I didn't know the dress code, so I went business casual. 
Look, the chandelier that I bought for my lake house. 
Oh, now our dreams are together. 
Sophie, it's not the look we were going for. 
Oh, I know. 
Much better, right? 
That is definitely not our style. 
It looks like a Tim Burton movie just spit up in here. 
I think it's kind of pretty. 
But what do I know? 
I once spent my last 50 bucks on a frog pinata. 
Had to have it. 
Max's Homemade Cupcakes. 
Yes, we're an upscale bakery, and Now, we sell hoagies. 
Oh, no, no, no, sir, we do not sell hoagies. 
Yes, we do. 
How many would you like? 
Let me get a pen. 
What's happening? 
Are we finally gonna trash Caroline? 
No, I need your help. 
I watched four chick flicks back-to-back, then I made a list of possible ways to tell Caroline I love her. 
I was gonna make more, but I got my period. 
Okay, run the choices past me. 
Whichever one makes me want to hurl the most, that's your winner. 
I could play a song for her outside of her apartment, but keep in mind how hard it is to find a boom box in 2012. 
Yeah, plus, if you do that outside our apartment, you'll be shot. 
By me. 
Okay, what about sharing cocoa and a hot dog on the ice rink in Central Park? 
Yup, that's it. 
Makes me want to take my head off and throw it into the street. 
Cool. 
Oh, and, Max, I think I'm the only straight guy on earth who knows the difference between Dylan McDermott and Dermott Mulroney, and that, my friend, is love. 
Oh, what's that funky-ass smell? 
Do they finally sell pepperoni febreze? 
Max, this already isn't working. 
The stinky salami, the gaudy chandelier? 
It's like a haunted Quiznos in here. 
Hey, I'm sending Oleg to Queens to pick up a flat of Fresca. Yeah. 
There's nothing better with a hoagie than an ice-cold Fresca. 
That's what I wanted! 
Look... 
They'll go great with the pickled eggs! 
This just went from my dream to a nightmare. 
Oh, my God, Caroline! 
It is you! 
Stacy, no way! I haven't 
seen you since graduation. 
We went to Wharton together. 
This girl is a genius. 
   Always top of the class. 
So what are you doing here? 
Buying a cupcake on your way to running the world? 
No, I own this shop. 
Oh. You own 
this little cupcake shop? 
And many other bigger shops. 
This is our new Williamsburg location. 
And yes, I know, the chandelier is all wrong. 
I told the designer, none of our Pacific Northwest locations will have the chandeliers. 
Of course, you'd own a cupcake empire at 25. 
 Oh, and this is Max. 
 Hi. 
I just transferred from our Boise location. 
What's that horrible smell? 
It's something called a "hoagie." 
The workers like them. 
Right, Max? 
Si, gracias por la hoagie. 
Well, I have to go. 
I'm consulting upstairs at BBD&L. 
 Oh, upstairs.  
 Yeah. 
Always knew you'd land on your feet. 
Let's go for drinks, and you're paying, mogul. 
I hope she likes water. 
Now what am I going to do? 
Stacy's in the building. 
Well, you could move to Narnia and run that branch, you pathological liar. 
Max, this is not how I want people to see me, or smell me, quite frankly. 
We have to get rid of the salami, the chandelier, and the Sophie. 
This is our dream, not hers. 
Okay, fine, I'll tell her. 
Hey, Sophie, can we talk to you? 
Good news, girls. 
Now we sell scratchers. 
But I have even a better idea. 
You two should dress up as big cupcakes and pass out free samples. 
Sophie, Max has something she wants to say to you. 
Wait. 
Girls, I have something to say first. 
Two days ago, I was on the verge of suicide. 
Yeah, seriously, I hadn't eaten all afternoon. 
But your generosity with your dream has given me a reason to get up and get a wax. 
Yeah. 
Oh. Max, there was something 
you wanted to say? 
I was going to say You look delicious. 
I look like Honey Boo Boo's mom at the prom. 
This is so humiliating. 
Now I know how Tyra felt when she went undercover as that fat person. 
Please tell me this is our bottom. 
Well, it's your bottom. 
I went to happy hour once and woke up naked in the penguin habitat at the Bronx zoo. 
And I did things. 
Hey, girls. 
What are you two doing just standing there? 
God gave cupcakes legs for a reason. 
You need to hit the streets, shake your cake maker, and show people your goods. 
Hey, don't look at me, it's vanilla. 
I was looking forward to going up to complete strangers on the street and saying "eat me," but she won't leave. 
Well, if you're not going to go out and get the customers, then I'll have to bring the customers to you. 
I gotta do everything around here. 
Seriously, I can't believe we're just standing here when we could be chasing fat people down the street, yelling, "you ate my brother!" 
Look at you two. 
What I wouldn't give for a giant glass of milk. 
   Look at you, though. 
You look so cute. 
No, don't look at me. 
I'm totally embarrassed in this thing. 
Yes, she's cute and embarrassed, in a larger-than-life, colorful, public setting. 
Ah, right. 
So, Caroline, listen, I wanted to Look, girls, some young professionals. 
Oh, my God! 
She's bringing Stacy. 
She can't see me in this. 
I was her valedictorian. 
Take this. 
Oh! Ugh! 
Oh! Wait. 
Help me up, Max! 
Help me up! 
Oh, great. 
Now you're like my mom. 
Here, give me your left hand. 
 Okay, give me your right hand. 
Get up! Get up! 
Five second rule. 
Ugh!  
What are you two crazy cakes doing? 
You lost your customers. 
They ran away. 
Oh, thank God. 
Oh, I don't get it. 
You won't push the hoagies or the pickled eggs. 
You must really have a fear of success. 
Well, at least we missed Stacy. 
Well, you know what else you missed? Andy. 
He was about to tell you he loves you. 
What? 
Just now, in the hall, and at the ice rink. 
He's been trying to tell you all week. 
But I've been too preoccupied with work, like Sandra Bullock in The Proposal. 
So he was gonna tell me at the ice rink? 
The one in Central Park? 
Yes, while having cocoa and splitting a hot dog. 
Oh, my God! 
That's, like, my dream "I love you" scenario. 
Why didn't you tell me sooner? 
Because when it comes to other people's creepy love stuff, that's when I'm a silent partner, and you need to stop with this creepy rom-com stuff. 
Life isn't like a movie. 
Sometimes you're not a success right away sometimes you have to just eat it and be a cupcake, and sometimes you have to take your "I love you" whichever way it comes. 
You are so right. 
I don't have to wait for the moment to be perfect, like it was for Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama. 
My life's not a romantic comedy. 
I can do it my own way. 
Like Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding. 
Andy, it's me! 
I'll be right out. 
No, this can't wait any longer. 
I don't need a big romantic comedy moment. 
 No   Oh! 
Oh. 
Oh, sorry. 
I thought it was the office! 
Not the office. 
I'm stuck. 
Oh, I want to go, but I can't. 
And I'll never be able to go again. 
Well, I'm on the toilet and you're in a cupcake. 
Can't get creepier than this, so, Caroline, I love you. 
I love you too. 
Oh, please, push me out. 
How'd it go? 
Was it romantic? 
He told me he loved me on the toilet. 
Oh, man! 
That's my dream scenario! 
 Hey. 
I'm only gonna do this for an hour, to show you how it's done, and then I'm out. 
This is your dream, not mine. 
Cupcakes! 
Free cupcakes! 
Come on, get 'em! 
Get 'em while they're hot! 
﻿1 Whoever tipped me in Monopoly money can go directly to jail. 
A dollar? 
Fake money and they're still under-tipping. 
Oh, look. 
I love it when people dress Guinea pigs up in adorable costumes. 
Han, you look like Babe Ruth. 
Well, baby Ruth. 
Maybe you two can kiss my sweet ass, because this outfit's a home run. 
I'm putting a team together for the restaurant league. 
Well, Han, I would play, but you know, I've got this hip thing, meaning, I'm too hip. 
What about you two? 
I'm telling you, I'm a great ball player. 
No, I'm a great ball player. 
I know how to cup and tickle mine at the same time. 
I'm talking about America's favorite pastime. 
Oh, so am I. 
Well, I'm in. 
I have a really good arm. 
Go over there, Han. 
Let's have a little catch. 
All right, here we go. 
All right. 
Go deep. 
Go deeper, Han. 
A phrase no other woman will ever say to him. 
Throw it, and don't be afraid to bring the heat. 
Ooh! 
Too much heat. 
Ball one... and two. 
Game over. 
I seem to have forgotten a crucial part of my uniform. 
Need a cup, Han? 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  You ladies can wait in here. 
Brian, before my father comes in, how are his spirits? 
You know, for someone who's looking at 60 to 100 years in prison? 
Pretty good. 
I'll bring him right in. 
Hey, Bri, anyone get killed today? 
You ask me that every time, Max, and every time I tell you, it's a white collar prison. 
Got it. Anyone get shanked 
with a Mont Blanc pen? 
Yo, B, one more thing. 
On Lock Up: Raw, they always spray the guards with a mixture of urine and feces, so Max, please, can we go one day without you mentioning that? 
I wonder why my dad wanted us to rush out here and see him today. 
He probably wants a conjugal visit. 
 Max! 
 Relax! 
With me. 
There they are, the light of my life  and her bouncer. 
 Hi, Daddy. 
Hey. 
Max. 
Oh, we startin' this? 
No foreplay? 
Oh. 
Listen, I'm sorry to make you come all the way out here on the--God help me--subway, but I actually need a favor. 
Help me break out. 
I'm kidding. 
Daddy, it's so amazing you can joke, but maybe not around Max. 
She's already offered to skin a guard alive and walk you out of here wearing him. 
Well, we know it works. 
All right, listen. 
This woman who used to work for me is being paid a million dollars to write a tell-all book about me. 
A million dollars? 
How much can I get for a tell-all book about Caroline? 
Chapter one: "Sleep farts." 
Max, please, can we go one day without you mentioning that? 
The woman's name is Sandra Rosenthal. 
Caroline, do you remember her? 
Yes, the one who lied on her resume. 
The one who couldn't even add, and worse than that, she wore brown with black together. 
I like brown and black together. 
I know. 
Wait, why would anybody pay that woman so much? 
What is she saying she has on you? 
Well, she's claiming she was fired because she had insider information about the Ponzi scandal, and that we were sleeping together, which we weren't. 
Of course you weren't. 
You would never sleep with someone who wore brown with black together. 
Man, I haven't seen this much hatred toward brown and black since the '50s. 
Anyway, I wanted you to hear it from me first, because she's about to go on Piers Morgan Live, and she can say whatever she wants. 
No, she can't, because I'll be there to refute her lies. 
I'll defend you with dignity and class and my new lipstick I just found on the subway. 
Wow, Piers Morgan. 
That dude's legit. 
He's got a show, he's got Piers 1 Imports. 
I don't know what I'd do without you, princess. 
You're the only person I can trust. 
Now, get out of here, 'cause I gotta speak to Max privately for a second. 
Oh... sure. 
 Okay, I  Just go. 
Daddy wants to talk to me privately. 
 Love you, sweetie. 
 Love you, Daddy. 
Brian, I'll just be right outside. 
So, Max... 
You know I'm all talk, right? 
I need you to tell Caroline something I couldn't bring myself to say. 
This woman is also claiming I have a small penis. 
Wait. 
So I stayed behind to see it? 
No. 
I want you to tell Caroline so she'll be prepared, 'cause I'm pretty sure that's the lie that got the book sold. 
How big of a lie? 
Oh, a really big one. 
So what did you and my father talk about? 
I don't want to tell you. 
I'm uncomfortable. 
You're uncomfortable? 
This must be bad. 
You've never been uncomfortable in your life. 
Is it drugs? Cancer? 
Oh! Did he fall in love 
in prison? 
I'll be fine with it. 
You can tell me. 
When we had money, I was very active in the Park Avenue Straights for Gay Doormen Alliance. 
Is this some kind of weird gang, or did a game just let out? 
Max, come on. 
Tell me. 
Fine, the woman's gonna say your father has a small Sir, your vuvuzela is very loud, and very 2010. 
My father has a what? 
He has a small Seriously, the game's over. 
And how on earth you have a wedding ring is beyond me. 
What is she gonna say about him? 
I can't hear you! 
She's going to say... 
Your father has a small penis! 
He thought it'd be less awkward if I told you. 
Was it? 
I can't believe that Sandra Rosenthal woman. 
There's another lie. 
Why, have you seen it? 
No, I haven't seen it! 
I never want to see it. 
Have you seen your father's penis? 
If I did, it was waving good-bye. 
Max, I've thought a lot about it, and I can't sit there while that woman waves my father's penis in Piers Morgan's face. 
You're lucky it's not Anderson Cooper, 'cause he'd be giggling up a storm. 
I have a plan. 
My goal on this show is gonna be to discredit that woman and tell people, even though my father did a bad thing, he did some wonderful things as well. 
Look, here he is working with UNICEF. 
Here he is rebuilding Haiti. 
Oh, this is just a cute picture of him water-skiing at a charity event on Lake Tahoe. 
What's the charity? 
White men without golf clubs? 
So that's my plan, and hopefully, going on that show will put an end to all these ridiculous rumors about my father. 
Hey, Caroline. 
Yeah. 
The word on the street is your dad's got a weenis. 
Sophie, how did you hear about that? 
Oleg told me. 
It came up on my Google penis alerts. 
I like to keep current, see what the trends are. 
You don't want to be that middle-aged guy wearing the same penis you had in high school. 
Great, now, it's all over the Internet and my shoulders are all up around my ears. 
Look, I'm too tense to even shake my head "no" at that liar woman, which was gonna be my key move. 
I need a massage, but I'm broke. 
Caroline, I'll give you a massage. 
Get ready for a sad ending. 
And beginning, and middle. 
There. 
Oh, yeah. 
How does that feel? 
Like baby spiders are dancing on my shoulders. 
You're the first Asian I've seen that can't give a massage. 
Hey, Caroline, I'll treat you and Max to a massage at my fancy spa. 
Cool! 
I've never been to a spa. 
The closest I've been is sticking my arm in the free blood pressure machine at Walgreens. 
Wait, that's for your arm? 
Thanks for the massage, Han. 
It was very nice Oh, you're still doing it. 
I had no idea. 
That was a-mazing! 
I mean, a guy rubbed me for an hour and didn't expect anything back? 
This massage stuff could catch on. 
I could not let go during my massage. 
Oh, was letting go an option? 
I was close, but I didn't want to get halfway there and have the management throw me out or something. 
I'm just so tense. 
Piers Morgan asks some difficult questions. 
Last week, he asked the Spring Breakers cast their thoughts on the North Korea situation. 
Shh! 
Sorry. 
Max, this is a quiet room. 
We have to be quiet. 
Hi, girls! 
Oh, I'm getting myself some fancy water. 
Look, they got lemon, orange, and cucumber. 
Ha! It's like a slot machine 
over here. 
Shh! 
Oh, I just had the best bamboo massage. 
Oh, they kept whacking me with it until I confessed to stealing that bread when I was seven. 
Oh, what a load off. 
Caroline, you still look a little tense, but I guess having to talk about your father's junk on national television will do that to a girl. 
I will not be speaking about my father's "junk" on television. 
No, I can't have lunch tomorrow. 
I'm doing Piers Morgan Live. 
You won't believe what just happened. 
You joined a demonic cult? 
Sandra, the liar writing the tell-all book, just walked in. 
She's getting a day of beauty too? 
This is like the gayest training for a fight ever. 
Sandra? 
Right this way. 
Lay face down. 
I'll give you a few minutes and I'll be right back in. 
Perfect. 
I really need this massage. 
Promoting my new book is exhausting. 
I'm sorry if that sounded braggy, but I guess that's how you sound when things are going so great for you. 
Ugh! That poor masseuse 
is gonna be forced to listen to her yammer on about her dumb book. 
But then again, mine had to hear me constantly say, "don't be afraid of the boobs." 
We should be hearing about that dumb book so I know what I'm up against. 
If there was only a way to get in that room. 
Oh, anyone can get into any room if they really want to. 
I mean, do you think that I was invited to the audition for the 2004 boat show? 
Yeah. 
Go. 
I'll take care of that masseuse. 
Sophie, you're not gonna hurt her, right? 
No. I'm gonna try 
tipping her first. 
I'm back. 
Yes, I was just out in the hall with you, now, here I am in the room with you, the same person. 
Just keep your head down, don't look up, and relax. 
You're not gonna talk a lot, are you? 
No, but you should feel free to. 
Whatever's on your mind or in in that book. 
What? 
What was that? 
That? 
That's just me, alone, creating a healing space with energy and sound. 
Lots of sound. 
So you're writing a big book. 
Do you want to tell me all about that? 
Well, it's about this guy, Martin Channing. 
Oh, he is very nice and very respectable. 
You won't think that after you read my book. 
I am really gonna stick it to him. 
Okay, now, you're just pushing me. 
Ugh! 
Uh, how did you uh... How 
how did you do that? 
It feels like you have three hands. 
That's how good I am. 
This is supposed to be a hot stone massage. 
Comin' right up. 
The hot stones. 
Oh! 
All right, here come the ho-o-ot stones. 
Oh! 
Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, that's nice. 
I'm really loosening up. 
Oh, well, then let's loosen you up some more. 
More stones. 
More stones! 
Yeah, I'm got paid a lot of money for my tell-all book, and I am really gonna tell all. 
Oh! Not there! 
Not there. 
What? 
What is going on in here? 
Well, what is happening here, Sandra, is you're about to go on national TV and tell America lies about my father. 
He never slept with you. 
Oh. Did he never sleep with me 
in your bedroom, on your pink canopy bed? 
You know what? 
That never happened. 
That's insane. 
You're crazy. 
Well, it's my word against yours. 
You're gonna be very embarrassed on TV. 
But not as embarrassed as you're going to be in the spa lobby, when I tell everyone that I was touched inappropriately by Caroline Channing. 
You are not gonna tell anybody that. 
Who's gonna stop me? 
Hey, girls. 
I was listening outside the door. 
Everything okay? 
Max, I don't know if I can do this. 
What if Sandra's telling the truth? 
She did know about my pink canopy bed. 
How would she know that? 
Because everyone knows Barbie comes with a dream car, a pony, and a pink canopy bed included. 
There he is. 
There's Piers Morgan, live. 
Do you think it's too soon to ask him to give me a discount at Piers 1? 
He looks dignified, like he's not gonna ask about a penis. 
But what if he does? 
Max, I can't do this. 
Give me your phone. 
You need to remind yourself of the person your father used to be. 
Look, here he is working with UNICEF. 
And here he is water-skiing on "Lake Rich Person." 
Look at that smile. 
Is that the smile of--hold up. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
What's coming out of the left leg of his swim shorts? 
I think your father's junk is trying to tell me there's gonna be six more weeks of winter. 
What are you saying? 
I'm saying, someone had a tip slip, and that is not a small tip. 
And as a waitress and a loose woman, I know a small tip when I see one. 
 Here. 
 Oh! 
Sorry, sorry. 
She just showed me a picture of Anne Hathaway's new haircut. 
Well, this is good, because it proves that woman is lying. 
Yep, you just have to show this to Piers. 
I told you, I'm not going near my father's penis. 
All I have to do is point out that that woman has no finance skills. 
Unlike her, we are taking the high road. 
Max, are you sending that to yourself? 
I'm here with Sandra Rosenthal, who's just signed a huge book deal to do a kiss-and-tell on disgraced financier Martin Channing. 
Welcome to you, Sandra. 
Hello, Piers. 
Thank you for allowing me to tell my story. 
It's a story, all right. 
Wow, so we're right into it. 
Okay, well, let me catch up. 
My other guest is Caroline Channing, daughter of Martin Channing, who, to put it mildly, is claiming that your book, Ms. Rosenthal, 
is a bunch of bull. 
That's right, Piers. 
It's pure rubbish, As your people say. 
That was perfectly American. 
Right, then, let me start with you. 
Well, to catch everybody up, Ms. Rosenthal's 
large book advance really has to do with something that turned out to be, by your words, very small. 
Comments, Ms. Channing? 
Psst! Psst! 
I'd rather not comment about that, Piers, because I have class, but I do have a question for Ms. Rosenthal, 
who was hired by my father because she claimed she had a degree in finance. 
Ms. Rosenthal, if a train 
carrying 27 passengers leaves Grand Central Station at 9:00 a.m., 
travels 800 miles to Chicago, arriving at 5:00 p.m., 
how fast was it traveling? 
Well, I Simple math, Piers. 
 100 miles an hour. 
 I'm sorry? 
That's your answer. 
Sorry, I'm a bit of a mathlete. 
Impressive. 
I've got a math equation for you. 
If a 3-inch train is entering a tunnel, do I even know it's there? 
Ladies, this isn't Maury Povich. 
Psst! Psst! 
Piers, I am simply trying to illustrate that she should have been able to answer it, had she been qualified for her job in finance. 
Everything that I am writing in the book is true, Piers. 
There is nothing that I have said that she can prove is untrue. 
Wait a minute, why is there a woman under my desk? 
Oh, is there, Piers? 
Yes, my father defrauded a lot of people, and he's paying a price for that, but I'm not gonna sit by silently while she exploits him with lies for her own gain. 
Piers, there's so much about my father I want you to know, like he What is this? 
Well... I know what this is. 
I've got one. 
But whose is it, and why am I looking at it? 
It's my father's. 
He had a bit of a tip slip. 
Madam, I don't know what you're looking for in a man, but this... 
Is far from inadequate. 
In fact, it's so far from inadequate, that I'm bringing this interview to an immediate close. 
Your book and you lack any credibility. 
That's it. 
"Can you hook me up with a discount at Piers 1 Imports?" 
Hey, you know, they'll probably come to you one day and want a tell-all book. 
Remember, we already have chapter one, "sleep farts." 
Chapter two: "My new Stepmom Max." 
Max, am I gonna have to defend my father forever? 
Probably, but don't worry, I'll be there to help. 
Thank you. 
'Cause it's a wife's job to defend her husband. 
It makes me sad to think he's gonna be in prison for the rest of his life. 
Don't think of it like that. 
He's not just in prison. 
He's in Africa working with UNICEF, he's in Haiti, he's water-skiing on "Lake Rich Person," and he's on the desktop of my computer. 
I should delete that. 
Where'd I leave my phone? 
Oh, God, are you guys looking at the picture of my dad? 
We are. Respect. 
So very much respect. 
Eh, I've seen better. 
Every day. 
Give me that. 
Oh! 
Hey. 
What are you doing back so early? 
Did Chestnut forget his wallet? 
No, we saw that cat we don't like. 
I tried to spray it with a water bottle, but it just laughed at us, so we ran. 
What are you doing out here? 
Enjoying the day. 
The coming of autumn is my favorite time of year. 
I love the leaves. 
Oh, gross! 
A condom! 
Wow, I guess autumn really is coming. 
Who would throw that over our wall? 
 That cat. 
 What? 
He's not only arrogant, he wants us to know he has sex. 
All I know is, if I had nine lives, I wouldn't wear a condom. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh o ooh ooh ooh  Hey, you know, we should start figuring out what to do with Chestnut this winter, now that it's already peak condom dropping season. 
You're right, Chestnut is the most important thing. 
But more importantly, what do you think of this vintage sweater I chose for my date with Andy? 
It's nice. 
But won't it be hard to pull off over your head in the cab? 
I'm assuming you'll do it in a cab. 
Max, it's a first date. 
That's not appropriate. 
Is it? 
I mean, I've never dated poor. 
What is acceptable on a first date? 
Well, I'm pretty classy, so anal? 
I'm not that poor. 
Well, you better give him something to keep him interested because he owns a candy store, and I want free candy forever. 
There he is. 
Can you bring him out in the yard, so he can see me in my sweater next to my horse? 
Okay, freak. 
But next time a guy comes knocking for me, you have to take him to my bedroom, so he can see me in my slayer shirt next to my glo worm filled with pot. 
Hello, sir, I'm here to pick up your daughter. 
And what exactly are your intentions? 
I don't know. 
Maybe take her on a romantic hayride, knock her out with chloroform, and sell her kidney for a new iPad. 
Son! 
Come outside. 
Miss Channing wants you to see her looking like the girl who got cut from the J. Crew catalog 
for being too white. 
Miss Channing? 
Max, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. 
Caroline is Caroline Channing Caroline Channing? 
Yeah, she used to be a billionaire, but now all her money is in here. 
Oh, wait, some of these are buttons. 
Oh. 
Okay. 
Yeah, I just thought she was a regular Williamsburg girl. 
No. 
She doesn't try that hard. 
And I was wrong. 
Oh, hi. 
I didn't hear you knock. 
Well, you two have a good time. 
And, young man, if you don't swing by your store and bring me some Pixie Sticks, you'll never see my little girl again. 
Way ahead of you. 
Yes! 
Yeah, definitely anal. 
Oh, baby. 
Look who's a half hour late for work. 
Must have been a pretty hot date with the candy man. 
So did you touch his whatchamacallit? 
Did you bring him to Almond Joy? 
His butterfingers got nowhere near my mounds. 
Now, if we could be adults for a second Well, your mounds are more like Sno-Caps, but continue. 
Well, nothing happened. 
Even after four hours of me breathing heavily and saying... 
"I'm having a really good time." 
Look, I don't want to be this girl, but I think think he might be gay. 
He's gay because he's not turned on by four hours of coffee breath? 
What's up? 
 I'm having a really good time. 
I must go to the men's room right now. 
That proves nothing. 
Oleg is always looking for an excuse to put it somewhere. 
Why do you think we don't serve bagels any more? 
Andy is not gay. 
And I'm not just setting you up for a life of confusing, self-questioning non-sex for the free candy, although that does sound like me. 
He is really into you. 
He might be into me, but he doesn't seem to want to get into me. 
Maybe he just wants me as a friend. 
No way. 
You are, like, 80 pounds and a coke addiction shy from being qualified to be a gay guy's female friend. 
What's so important you two have to be in here gabbing like schoolgirls when there are customers waiting? 
If you must know, Caroline and I were discussing if someone we know is gay. 
I once had a homosexual experience in college. 
With another girl? 
No, there was a boy who was interested in me. 
He was captain of the football team. 
He would come to my dorm room and ask me to do his homework, and then he would leave. 
Oh. 
Never mind. 
I never had a homosexual experience. 
Keep wearing those sweaters, Han. 
It'll happen. 
And if you think your life sucks now, it just got worse. 
Look, a new hipster strain. 
Ironic Amish. 
No way. 
I'm taking care of these two butter churners right now. 
Look, I'm telling you what I told Mumford & Sons, get out. 
Go. 
Go, you hipster Amish wannabes. 
But we really are Amish. 
Yes, we're here on Rumspringa. 
And I'm here on a little bit of vodka. 
It's sort of like what you might call Spring Break. 
We get to leave the ways of the Amish and experience the modern world. 
Well, I beggeth thy forgiveness. 
Haveth a seat-eth in the booth-eth. 
Have a seat in the booth. 
Earl, I got two Amish in my booth. 
Well, you let them know right up front that we don't accept travelers checks or livestock. 
So Amish, huh? 
Yes, ma'am. 
From Pennsylvania. 
"Ma'am"? 
You know what, that's kind of hot. 
I always thought I'd have to wait 20 more years to be a cougar, but, rawr, here I am. 
Why don't I bring you boys some coffee, on me? 
We can't drink coffee, ma'am. 
Coffee is the Devil in a cup. 
We can do whatever we want, Jacob, we're in New York. 
Yeah, Jacob. 
Listen to, uh  Jebediah. 
 For real? 
Did you see the size of her nursers? 
Those guys are for real Amish. 
I love the Amish culture. 
You love every culture. 
You salute the flags at IHOP when we walk by. 
Oh, my God. 
That's it. 
Max, question. 
What are the Amish known for? 
Oh, no. 
It's sixth grade all over again. 
Just give me an "F" and move on. 
Barns. 
They build barns, and we We need a barn for Chestnut. 
Come on. 
And let me do the talking. 
I am very good at manipulating young boys. 
I once got a ten-year-old I was babysitting to buy me a box of Pop-Tarts with his allowance. 
So this is our place. 
Not much, but You have so many possessions. 
Are you rich, ma'am? 
Yes. 
And I have to say, this "ma'am" thing is still working for me. 
Um, okay, Jacob. 
That's enough with the lights. 
There will be plenty of time for fun with electricity tomorrow, but it's late. 
Let's discuss sleeping arrangements. 
You two can sleep out here, and Max and I will sleep in her bed. 
Does that work for you? 
Both: Okay. 
Oh, sorry. 
I left my bra. 
Your your b-b-bra? 
Jacob, stop acting like a child. 
I'm sorry about him. 
Don't be. 
At least it was her bra. 
Mine would have killed the kid. 
So I was thinking we could drive our truck to my Uncle's lumberyard in the morning and get the wood for the barn. 
Okay, but there seems to be plenty of wood right here. 
Oh, hello. 
Don't be embarrassed, Jacob. 
It's perfectly natural when you're exposed to new things. 
The first time I saw a picture of those fat twins on scooters, I was hard for days. 
Why don't you two go outside and play with the horse? 
Both: Okay. 
And thank you for letting us stay at your place. 
Your home is dope. 
You don't even know what that means, Jebediah. 
It's hipster talk, Jacob, and it's awesome. 
Are we sure this is a good idea? 
You saw how turned on he was. 
He was practically raising a barn in his pants. 
We're fine, they're fine. 
Just a typical male reaction to a couple of hot cougars like us. 
Ra. 
Rawr. 
You know what isn't a typical male reaction? 
Not calling or texting a girl you're interested in. 
Well, why don't you just text Andy, then? 
What should I text? 
"Why so gay, question mark"? 
I don't know. 
The only thing I've ever texted to a guy is, "there's a cop behind you, walk past me." 
Just say "hey." 
Okay. 
I can do that. 
"Hey." 
Huh, it autocorrected to "gay." 
Even the phone's getting that vibe. 
There, sent it. 
"Hey." 
Do you think I could grab a beer? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
Look, they're working for us for free. 
 One beer each. 
 Awesome, awesome, awesome. 
Max, you can't give underage kids beer in our home. 
Why? 
Isn't that what love is? 
Jebediah, beer is the Devil's saliva. 
Neighbors come a-calling after midnight in Williamsburg? 
Where is this William? 
I'd like to compliment him on his burg. 
Hi, girls, I just came down for a cupcake Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
Hold on. 
Who are the two cute puppies in the kitchen? 
Look at you two. 
You are the cutest little things. 
Yes, you are Ooh, and this one has an erection. 
Jacob, don't look directly at her. 
She's like an eclipse with boobs. 
Sorry, girls. 
I didn't mean to interrupt your lovers' session. 
Sophie, they're just here to build a barn for Chestnut. 
Oh, sure. 
Wink, wink. 
"Building a barn," is that what we're calling it now? 
Wink, wink. 
Caroline's telling the truth, Sophie. 
It's strictly business. 
Oh, so you're paying for them? 
Okay. 
Ooh la la. 
How much do they cost? 
Because, yeah, I also need a barn. 
Wink, wink. 
Well, here's your cupcake, Sophie. 
Good night. 
Oh, but I want to play with the puppies. 
It's very late. 
You can come back in the morning. 
Oh. 
This is like when they cancelled Christmas in my village. 
Look, look at his pants. 
That one misses me. 
Nighty night, puppies. 
That must be Andy. 
Emojis? 
He sent me emojis? 
All I get back are tiny, little pictures, when I spent the time and energy to write "Hey"? 
Rainbow, dollar sign, muffin. 
Could be worse. 
I once got naked guy, naked girl, tombstone. 
I wasn't sure what it meant, but I immediately got tested. 
Yep, Chestnut, pretty soon you'll be safe and sound, with a roof over your head, and you and I can finally be safe from the unending torment of that condom-throwing cat. 
All ready for my second date. 
Slut, party of one. 
Slut, party of one. 
You know it. 
Plus, I'm taking him to that bar where only cheap girls go to get laid. 
You know, the one you like. 
Oh, The Just Slip It Inn? 
And if that place plus this outfit doesn't put his pedal to my metal, it's clearly never happening. 
Well, that outfit's sexy, but not foolproof. 
Oh, it's not? 
Follow me, please. 
Jacob. 
And I'm not saying I'm that hot, but I've never seen anybody drop wood and get wood at the same time. 
Bye, baby, mama's going to get day-laid. 
Hey, Max. 
Would it be okay if we take our shirts off? 
We're sweating, and Yes. 
I mean, that's sure, whatever. 
If you want to. 
Oh, crap. 
I don't have any ones. 
Could you spray me with that water bottle? 
Oh, right. 
Oh, I'm going to spray you. 
Is that really what you think is going to happen? 
I'm going to spray you, and then I'm going to get turned on, and then I'll start spraying stutter stud over there, and then we're all having sex? 
No, Max. 
I got him. 
Here you go, puppies. 
Oh, now I wet the shy one. 
Oh, and, boys, I'm going to need you to come up here next and fix something because it broke. 
What's broken? 
Uh That. 
 Hot   hot  Look at the couple behind us. 
I mean, save some for the men's room stall, am I right? 
I'm having a really good time. 
What? 
I'm having a really good time! 
I think we need more drinks. 
Would you like a Jack and coke? 
Or maybe just a Jack? 
Oh, no, if you're calling me, then the date's not going well. 
I'm not crazy, right? 
He did hunt me down and beg me to go out with him? 
Nothing again? 
Well, maybe he's not feeling that place. 
Well, then he's the only one, 'cause it's so horny here, I'm about to have sex with the couple at the next table, and they're both redheads, which is so gross. 
Hold on a second. 
Um, hey, guys? 
Yeah? 
Perfect, thanks. 
I mean, why did he even ask me out again? 
Well, I kind of might have said something Max! 
Now I'm even more humiliated. 
You forced a gay guy to go out with me? 
Who am I? 
The girl with lupus at the prom? 
Andy is not gay. 
He hasn't said one mean thing about strangers while I've been around him. 
Well, then he's paralyzed from the waist down and hides it by walking. 
Okay, that's it. 
I'm leaving. 
No, don't, I'll come there. 
Maybe it'll help. 
You two were really hot when I was standing between you. 
True. 
Okay, and hurry. 
I don't want to go home with the redheads. 
Why do they even let them in here? 
Leaving here is probably a good idea anyway. 
If I stay any longer, I'm going to do something I'll have to pretend to regret. 
Whoa. 
How weird running into you guys here. 
My favorite bar that I come to all the time just 'cause. 
Hi, Andy. 
These guys are our friends. 
We're Amish. 
Awesome band name. 
Why did you bring them? 
I was afraid to leave them home. 
Sophie was running out of things to break in her apartment. 
So what are you guys drinking? 
Beer. 
Shut it, Jacob, or I will smite thee. 
Wait, uh, I'll go with you. 
FYI, I'm leaving with the redheads in five minutes. 
Hi, can I get a pitcher of tap, please? 
Would you like to dance, Caroline? 
Oh, thank you. 
But that is so not my thing. 
And besides, that's not so much a dance floor as an STD Mosh Pit. 
Awesome. 
So she called you, right? 
I saw her talking on the phone using lots of hand gestures. 
I figured it was about how bad the date is. 
Okay, I'm going to try and put this as politely as I can, but what the hell is wrong with you? 
Make a move. 
Max, I really like her, but... 
What is the but? 
But she's Caroline Channing. 
And you're Andy something. 
So? 
Yeah, I'm Andy something who owns a small candy store, and she was practically a princess. 
Was. 
Was a princess. 
Now she has five pairs of underwear and hasn't done laundry in eight days. 
Max, honestly, I mean, I use those stupid emojis to buy time to figure out what I wanted to say. 
That's why emojis exist. 
So guys like me don't have to say, "I'm not good enough. 
I sell gum." 
She's the same girl you met in your candy store. 
No, she's not. 
That was just a regular, pretty Williamsburg girl. 
Now, she's refined, rich Caroline Channing. 
He thinks you're rich and refined. 
 It's a real boner blocker. 
 What? 
He found out who you were, and he's intimidated. 
You have to act cheap and unrefined. 
It's the only way. 
Here we go. 
I also ordered you guys some nachos. 
No jalapenos. 
I know that's the Devil's garnish. 
Great, nachos. 
They're so low-rent like me. 
But first, I'm going to chug some draft beer like I always do. 
And now I'm gonna freak-dance. 
Slut, party of one. 
Come on, Jacob. 
I'm going to tear that ass up. 
Y-y-you are? 
  See? 
That's not special at all. 
Oh, my God! 
Call the paramedics. 
I danced an Amish boy to death. 
Look at poor Jacob. 
I feel awful. 
It was just panic attack coupled with his first orgasm. 
Paramedics said he'll be fine. 
I think that's what they said. 
It was hard to hear over all their laughing. 
More emojis from Andy. 
Christmas tree, fireworks, Martini glass. 
Okay, that's it. 
I'm done. 
Well, here he comes. 
What is this supposed to mean? 
Oh, that? 
That means... 
I love emojis. 
I think my work here is done. 
Max, I'm going to go with Jacob in that thing we wouldn't let take our grandmother. 
And I just wanted to say good-bye and thank you for everything. 
Well, you built us a barn, we almost killed your friend I'd say we're even. 
Well, Jacob says he's going to go home, but I met this girl in the bar whose roommate overdosed yesterday, so there's a spare room, and I've decided to stay. 
Cool. 
So got any words of wisdom for a kid trying to make it in the world? 
No, do you? 
Look, just know you're going to struggle for a while. 
Someone's going to ask you what time it is, and when you look at your watch, he's going to put his penis on you. 
But like Dan Savage says, it gets better. 
Although it hasn't for me, so maybe that only applies to questioning teens. 
In short, there's really no point to anything, but sometimes, you get to eat candy or have sex, and that's when it all feels right. 
Oh, no. 
Caroline, the cat. 
I'm on my own. 
Fine. 
Oh, no, you bastard, not tonight. 
It is not going down tonight. 
All right, you win this one.
