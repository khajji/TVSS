1 Hi, how can I help you? 
And by that I mean, "What's the least I can do to help you." 
I'll have the burger with the fries. 
She'll have it with the salad. 
But I want the fries. 
Ah, you want them, but you don't need them. 
Fine. The salad. 
I have to pee. 
 Hi, what's your name? 
 David. 
David, you should go. 
I'm sorry? 
You want her to have salad, she wants you to have hair. 
Neither one's gonna happen tonight. 
Yeah, it's not gonna work out between you and French fries. 
Oh, maybe it will for a week or a year. 
Depends if she was molested as a kid. 
But one of these days, she's coming after you. 
Probably in the dark, probably with a knife. 
And she's gonna cut off one or both of your balls. 
And you won't think a side of fries matters when you have zero balls. 
She'll have the fries. 
Yes, she will. 
Look at us. 
We saved another woman's dignity and another man's balls. 
Yeah, we're like dr. Phil 
but more qualified. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Season 3, Episode 4 "And the Group Head" Well, here I am, the owner, waiting on tables. 
Does Barack Obama unclog the White House toilets? 
What's wrong with this picture? 
Well, off the top of my head, I ordered a coffee ten minutes ago, and you still haven't gotten it. 
Hey, man, I'm in the weeds here. 
Well, if you got weed, cancel the coffee. 
Uh, ladies, you're late. 
And little man Tate over there is in a mood. 
Why, is he teething again? 
Uh, hello. 
You were supposed to be here ten minutes ago. 
In Korea, your heads would be on sticks outside the Samsung factory, and you would still have to work. 
There is no coffee prepped for your shift. 
F.Y.I., tiny dancer, 
prepping coffee is that lazy-ass day waiter's job, So don't blame us. 
It's not our fault you hired an incompetent wait staff. 
Hurry up. 
You two need to make coffee. 
And you need to hire a new day waiter. 
And maybe while you're getting new things around here, how about a brand-new coffeemaker? 
One that isn't from an Edward Hopper painting. 
Am I the only one who's been to a museum? 
Uh, excuse me. 
I've been to the art section of Bed, Bath & Beyond. 
What if I told you I already got you what you want? 
A high-end cappuccino machine? 
Listen, blonde ambition. I know 
you only want me to get one, so you can use it at your cupcake window. 
How dare you? Unless you're 
comfortable with that. 
No, I meant the new day waiter. 
He's in the kitchen. 
Go train the new guy. 
What happened to the guy we told you to fire? We loved him. 
Okay, we'll go train the new guy now. 
But about that coffeemaker, what if go halfsies with you? 
We can't afford to go halfsies. 
We can't even go quarter-sies or eight-sies or whatever's after eight-sies Sixteenth-sies. 
Shoot yourselves. 
Did he say train the new guy or new gay? 
Hi, you must be the new day waiter. 
Ah, you must be the late girls who are supposed to train me. 
Yes, I'm Luis. 
Did he say Luis or Louise? 
I'll be out in a minute. I have 
to let this cream dry on my face. 
Oh, I always wait for the cream to dry. 
It's the polite thing to do. 
I'm Max. 
Oh, Max is funny. 
Look at her. 
Oh, funny to mask the pain. 
I see you. 
Oh, and you're both pretty. 
Look at blondie. 
What have you had done? 
Oh, me? 
Nothing, but thank you. 
I'm Caroline. 
Well, nice to meet you, but we won't be friends. 
I don't get attached. 
All my life, I've been a waiter, 27 years. 
I've been a waiter 27 years too, and I'm only 26. 
And I don't get personal, so don't ask me how old I am. 
I am 53. 
But my face is 5. 
You look amazing. 
I've only been waiting tables two years. 
My main focus is our cupcake business. 
We just opened a walk-up window... 
Honey, honey, I don't need to know your life. 
You don't need to know mine. 
Did my father put a gun in his mouth at my seventh birthday party? 
Yes, but I don't bring that to work. 
And I'm in love with you. 
Don't do that. 
Don't fall in love with me. 
You know those gays that don't like women? 
I'm one of them. 
Is that the theme song from Sex and the City? 
You know it is. 
I'm a Charlotte. 
So am I! 
There's not a lot of us. 
I'm all the dead girls from American Horror Story. 
Well, let's get this train on the tracks. 
Follow me, Charlotte. 
I'm not giving up on our cappuccino machine. 
I'm gonna work Han hard until he gives it to me. 
Yes, I just heard how that sounded. 
Okay, Luis, here's how the tables work. 
We got the four-tops. 
We got the two-tops. 
 Are you a top? 
 Oh, please. 
No one is pushing this $25,000 face into a pillow. 
I'm ready to order. 
Luis, why don't you take that table? 
It's part of your training, and I don't want to. 
Earl, that's the new day waiter. 
He's also the new gay waiter. 
Oh, I love the gays. 
They turned an old crack house in my neighborhood into a cheese shop. 
I heard that cheese shop has really good crack. 
What's the soup of the day? 
What does it say on the board? 
And you're trained. 
Max, Han said no, and we need that cappuccino maker for our shop if we're ever gonna compete with the Starbucks around the corner or the other corner, or the other corner. 
Or the one that's currently being built in my ass. 
What? 
It's prime real estate. 
Everything else in Williamsburg is taken. 
Caroline, you need a cappuccino machine? 
I can get you one cheap. I know a guy. 
And if you need clean urine or a micro pig, I also know that guy. 
Oh, my god. 
Who was that? 
Oh, that's... that's Oleg. 
He's the cook. 
He is gorgeous. 
I'm so excited. 
Our new machine will be here any minute. 
Our lives are about to get a lot more cappuccino-y. 
Or should I say a latte more cappuccino-y? 
No, you should not say any of that. 
And as for that "special price"" Oleg said he'd give us? 
In all my three-ways, I'm up to bat first, and I don't kiss. 
Ugh. 
During the day, it is hot in herrr. 
Thanks for the weather report, Ursher. 
Here it is. Shut the windows 
and shut up. 
Well, this is starting exactly like I imagined. 
Shut it! 
 Oleg, where did you get this? 
 Shut up! 
 Are those sirens? 
 Shut up! 
Does it come with instructions? 
The instructions are to shut up. 
We don't want it if it's stolen. 
I still feel guilty about shaking down that redbox for I don't know how she does it. 
I did not steal it. 
I knowingly bought it from a man who stole it, and I'm selling it at a profit. 
It's the Armenian way. 
You're not Armenian. 
I know, I'm just saying, it's the Armenian way. 
It retails for $600, but I'll give it to you for free if you do me a favor. 
Free? 
Okay, I guess Max can do you in that closet over there. 
What? 
Now that I see it, I have to have it. 
All right, I've been saving this pill for something. 
Talk to Sophie. 
See if she wants to get back together. 
But don't tell her I'm interested. 
 Do it discreetly. 
 Deal. 
And, Oleg, I'm touched and a little surprised. 
I didn't know you knew the word "discreetly". 
Oh, yeah. I have a word-a-day 
calendar near my bed, next to my big pump jar of pineapple lube. 
For when you're horny and hungry. 
Max, why'd you take it? 
You don't have to have sex with him. 
I know, I'm celebrating. 
Hey, I can't find any of the instructions on here for our coffeemaker. 
In fairness, I haven't been looking. 
I got sidetracked by this buzzfeed list of misspelled tattoos. 
This girl got "You go grill" on her neck. 
She must really like to cook outside. 
Did you put yourself in a time-out? 
No, I'm looking for Sophie. 
She's not upstairs. 
Look, this is a long way to go to get something for free. 
I was happy to walk into Sears and stuff a cappuccino machine down my pants. 
I'm not doing it for the free cappuccino machine. 
I'm doing it for the money we'll make from the free cappuccino machine. 
And maybe to help Oleg and Sophie get back together. 
You know, it's a page out of Shakespeare, and I'm Puck. 
Puck from The Real World? 
Am I the only one who's read a book? 
Oh, here she is. I'll do the talking. 
It's kind of in my wheelhouse. 
You have a wheelhouse, and we're living in this dump? 
Morning, Sophie. 
You caught me. I'm doing 
the walk of shame. 
You know what that means, right? 
I was having sex all night with a stranger. 
I had sex with a guy all night once. 
At least that's what he said. 
I fell asleep at 10:00. 
Sophie, come in. We wanted to ask 
you something kind of important. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, I'll tell you. 
I don't think you're gonna make it in the cupcake business. 
Not what the psychic in the subway told me, but duly noted. 
Actually, it's more of a personal question. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, I personally don't think you're gonna make it in the cupcake business. 
 No, the question is about Oleg. 
 Oh, yeah, he agrees with me. 
God's sakes, just tell her before she tells us we're gonna wind up in some disgusting apartment, hiding from our pimp. 
Okay, okay, Sophie. 
Do you ever think about getting back together with Oleg? 
Oh, God, no. 
I'd rather accidently have sex again with my cousin. 
I hate when that happens. 
Why, did... 
Did he ask about me? 
Oh, no, no. I was just wondering. 
He never even mentions you. 
Oh, good. 
'Cause I moved on, baby. 
Oh, no. No, I... 
I left my spanx on that Staten Island stoop. 
And they're the good ones, you know, with the pee hole in them. 
I gotta go grab 'em. 
All right. Bye-bye. 
Okay, good. Now we've got the power on, 
but how do we steam the milk? 
Maybe it's on this touchpad thing. 
Holy Mother of God! 
I just steamed my vagina. 
Max, Caroline, your shift started three minutes ago. 
Who cares about sidework? 
I probably can't have children. 
What is wrong with her? 
She just had her carpet steam-cleaned. 
You two still haven't figured out this machine? 
Move away. I'm asian and a man. 
I'm good with this kind of stuff. 
Well, Han, actually, it's pretty dangerous. 
Hey, Han's a man, according to recent lore. 
Let him save the day. 
Okay, let's see. 
Here's the steam one. 
And here's the button for... 
Ow! 
My neck! 
It burned my neck! 
And that was my best feature. 
Luckily you're not taller. 
You would've burned your vagina. 
That cappuccino machine might have just given me a grande hysterectomy. 
Caroline, I know this might not be a good time. 
I heard about your recent clambake. 
But what did Sophie say? 
I'm sorry, Oleg. Sophie's moved on. 
She's seeing other men. 
Yeah, but not in your neighborhood. 
She's classy. 
She had the decency to do it on a stoop in Staten Island. 
She went to the Island without me? 
We were going to travel the world together. 
Oleg... 
Oleg, are you crying? 
No, I have a booger situation. 
Says the man who cooks the food. 
Hey, what's this area back there? 
 Uh, it's our closet, why? 
 I should check it out. 
I'm always looking for places to have sex with women who are not Sophie. 
Is Oleg in here? 
I thought I smelled him. 
That delicious mix of man and butter. 
Oleg's in the closet. 
Oh, honey, I could've told you that. 
Really, Luis, Oleg is straight. 
Wait till you see what happens when I place an order for a bone-in rib eye. 
It's true. 
He shows us his penis every... 
Ah-ah-ah-ah, boundaries, girls, boundaries. 
So is it a nice one? 
Well, it did open a door for me once. 
Hey, Luis, maybe you can help us. 
Since you're a lifer, you have to know how to work this thing. 
No, no, no, no, no, no, I work for a diner. 
I don't work for you. 
Don't bring me into your drama. 
Oh, I have to get this. It's my mother. 
She's on death watch. 
But we used to have the same machine when I worked at Starbucks. 
Mami, como esta su Lou Gehrig's? 
No, I am not working at Starbucks. 
That's not what I was gonna say. 
Just for two hours. 
We can quit after we learn how to work this damn machine. 
Hey, I am not a quitter. 
I get fired. 
That's my wheelhouse. 
I can't believe we got hired so quickly. 
And I can't believe I'm a medium apron. 
And I can't believe I'm working for a corporate coffee place. 
This might be the lowest point of my life, and my mom once lost me in a craps game behind a casino. 
Hi, we're here to be trained. 
I know. 
That's unfortunate. 
 My name's Devon. 
 Well, that's unfortunate. 
Let's get this over with. 
I have a lot of other places I need to be. 
Like your mom's basement? 
Hey, you don't have to give me attitude. 
I don't have to, but it's my pleasure. 
Sorry, Devon. It's just that it's hard 
for her, 'cause your name is Devon. 
So what are you girls? 
Writers? 
Folk duo? 
Just bitches? 
Nailed it, loser. 
Max, pace yourself. We need this job 
for another hour and 50 minutes. 
Okay, but for real, how long do you gotta work here before the health insurance kicks in? 
And is there dental? 'cause I got 
a dead tooth doing nothing for me. 
The insurance kicks in after 30 days. 
But it's a PPO, not an HMO. 
Oh, we just got an HMO at our other job. 
He's a Charlotte. 
Okay, here we go. 
Look, this is the machine we use for everything. 
It's incredibly easy to work unless you're stupid, in which case, tell me now. 
Devon, we're not your mean stepdad. 
Just show us how to use the machine. 
Listen up. 
Unlatch the portafilter from the group head. 
Press here for an ounce of grounds. 
Tamp it in, pack it down, turn it on. 
I didn't get that, did you? 
Honestly, all I heard was "group head". 
So you tamp, pack, turn the knob, wait 3, blast for 30, then you pour the shot. 
Place the steam wand halfway in the pitcher at a 45-degree angle until the milk is 103 degrees. 
So what you're saying is it's easier to make meth? 
Syrups, powders, whipped cream is right here. 
You ever work with one of these? 
I think I can handle it. 
I went to Wharton. 
 Well, I went to Harvard. 
 And I went to juvie. 
And we're all here wearing an apron. 
A grande double cap, non-fat. 
Grande double cap, non-fat. 
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. 
A venti triple cap, no whip. 
Venti triple cap, no whip. 
Meow, meow, shmeow, meow. 
Grande double soy latte. 
Grande double soy latte. 
Got it, Max? 
Nope. 
 Where's those drinks, Max? 
 Working on it, getting close. 
And I finished all over myself. 
That's so me. 
Come on, Max, it can't be that hard. 
You two, switch. 
I gotta put out more napkins. 
That women's breakup support group is here, and they tap us out. 
Think they're crying now? 
Just wait till we run out of cake pops. 
I'll have a tall cap, triple-shot half caf. 
Small scrap nipple slap half half. 
That's not what I said. 
Tall cap triple-shot half caf? 
Girl, you're good at this. 
You should work at Starbucks. 
I am good. I think 
I'm getting the hang of this. 
Now I just have to... 
Holy Mother of... 
Ouch! 
This thing hates women so much, we should call it Texas. 
Or Ohio. 
Or, to be honest, most of America. 
I'll have a tall drip, extra hot. 
 Uh, what's your name? 
 Gregg, with three "g"'s. 
Yeah, you're gonna be this picture of a penis. 
 That's rude. 
 Now it has a hat on it. 
It's saying, "good day." 
Do you want me to talk to your manager? 
Yeah, in about 20 minutes, after she learns this machine. 
Hi. 
I'll take a non-fat venti drip for Vera and a tall latte for Fran and a gingerbread latte with 11 splendas. 
Can you two explain what this is? 
 I'd say it's pretty obvious. 
 That's a penis wearing a hat. 
Why? 
Because it's bald and a little insecure. 
 Dudes, you're, like, fired. 
 Come on, Devon. 
We just need 20 more minutes to learn that machine. 
Please? 
No. 
Return your aprons and caps. 
And do not even think about putting sandwiches in your pockets. 
What? 
A girl can't get a morning bun? 
No and no. 
And take this "crappuccino" you made with you. 
Oh, yeah, that is not quite right. 
And it hit my dead tooth. 
 How you doing with that milk? 
 Great. 
Mine's more whipped than Nick Cannon. 
Hola, chicas. How's it going 
with your new machine? 
Not that I care or am invested at all. 
Oh, I think mine's coming. 
I think mine's coming. 
You don't even know if you're coming or not? 
That's so you. 
Have you seen Oleg? 
No, not since he came out of the closet. 
 Why are you looking for him? 
 How is this your business? 
Because you said, "Have you seen Oleg?" 
You got me. Look at you. 
So much spice, so much pain. 
You got me. 
Hey, everybody. 
Hola, Oleg, and Oleg's sister? 
This is Sasha. 
We met last night and a few times this morning. 
 But do me a favor. 
 Don't tell Sophie about this? 
No, do tell her. 
I've moved on. 
I filled that hole she left. 
Come on, let's get you back to your uncle's house before he wakes up. 
Oh, it happens to a lot of gays. 
They come out, they freak out, they go back in. 
But I see him. 
And I'll be here until he sees me. 
Hola, mami. 
Uh-oh. Charlotte's 
headed for a fall. 
I did it. 
I made a perfect cappuccino. 
75% of my body is burned, but I did it. 
So how is it? 
We are so putting the small scrap nipple slap half half on the menu. 
﻿1 Okay, Max, I figured out our new schedule. 
And I figured out the cheap toothpaste we've been using is really diaper cream. 
On the plus side, that rash cleared up on my gums. 
We'll do our diner shift from 6:00 till 2:00, then sell cupcakes here from 2:00 to 4:00, make the cupcakes in the morning from 7:00 to 11:00, and then pastry school from 12:00 to 4:00. 
 Forget anything? 
 Just poopin' and sleepin'. 
Now, I have to go rewrite the schedule. 
Let's go, Max, you have a huge, huge day tomorrow. 
 First day of pastry school. 
 Stop saying it's huge. 
Whenever I think something's gonna be huge, it just turns out to be all balls. 
Season 3, Episode 10 "And the First Day of School" I splurged and had my blouse cleaned. 
Dry cleaning bags remind me of when I had money. 
Really? They remind me of when 
my mother tried to suffocate me. 
Allegedly. 
Let's go. 
Wait, wait. 
Max, you can't go yet. 
I need you to stay and help with something. 
Han, I told you... it's bend and wipe, 
then up come your big boy pants. 
Yeah, Han’s right. You can't go. 
Stay here a few more minutes. 
Why? Oh. Are we having 
an intervention for Max? 
Hey, everybody. 
Oh, I hope I'm not late for Max's first day of school surprise party. 
Sophie, we hadn't surprised her yet. 
Oh, but she's right there. 
You just blew it, Han. 
Aw, a surprise party. 
 Isn't this sweet, Max? 
 I don't trust it. 
Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me, his penis was on a hot dog bun. 
One meat lover's pizza. 
And one meat lover. 
Max, come on. 
Get it while it's hot. 
You're opening that box. 
Hm, who's got a ten to tip the cute pizza delivery guy? 
Sophie, this is Luis, the day waiter. 
Oh, you're Sophie, Oleg’s ex. 
Sister, I know all about you. 
Oh, do you? 
Do you know all about me? 
I'm his good friend. 
You know, I'm having trouble hearing your accent. 
Did you say "good friend" or "girlfriend?" 
Please, mami. 
I wish. 
I like the entertainment. 
It's better than the magician at my friend Stephanie's 16th birthday that made her virginity disappear. 
Max, we're all so proud of you. 
Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life. 
Aw, crap. 
I gotta do this again? 
All right, but this time, I'm not seeing Trouble with the Curve. 
 You are about to do something very big. 
 Yes, she is. Such a big step. 
Big step for both of us, 'cause I'll be using my business acumen working in the office to help pay the tuition. 
Shh. 
I'm talking about Max. 
So we all chipped in to get you something for your first day of school. 
It's my first day too. 
Caroline, please, I can't hear Han talking about Max, okay? 
Here you go, darling, a book bag for school. 
So what, then? Is my surprise 
party after this one? 
What is happening? 
People doing nice things for me and smiling? 
Am I transferring foster homes again? 
And there's more stuff inside. 
That was supposed to be a surprise too. 
Oh. 
Surprise! 
Max, open it. 
Look inside. 
Yeah, Max, see what's inside for your big day. 
Big day for Max. 
Big day for me as well. 
 A metrocard? No way. 
 From me. Unlimited rides. 
Oh. Unlimited rides? Is that 
what your tramp stamp says? 
I was gonna get mad, but that was a damn good one. 
What's this? 
Han's house? 
A simple "thank you" would suffice. 
Thank you for your house, Han. 
It's a pencil case, and I love it. 
And I was sitting here, thinking how you were all ignoring my part of the big day. 
And then, you give me this pencil case to use in the office and prove me wrong. 
That's for Max. 
What the hell is wrong with you people? 
Max doesn't even need pencils. 
She'll be baking. 
Well, she'll be baked. 
Take a look. 
Joints. 
Earl, that's so sweet. 
These should last me till recess. 
Wait, where's the chef's coat Sophie had monogrammed? 
Han, that was supposed to be a surprise. 
Oh, I know. 
Karma's a bitch. 
Oh, well. 
Look. 
My name's on this. 
The only thing my name's ever been on before is a urine sample. 
Thank you, everyone. 
So there is nothing in that bag for me? 
Nothing? Wow. I'd even take Oleg’s 
penis in a hot dog bun right now. 
I'll be right back. 
 Getting on. 
 Please move. 
 On! 
 Move! 
 On! On! 
 Move! Move! 
I love the subway. It's the perfect 
place to get out aggression. 
I just punched someone in the kidney. 
 It was me. 
 I know. 
Oh, oh, bad smell, like someone hooked up with a falafel. 
 It was me. 
 I know. 
 Max. 
 Sorry. 
Subways, planes, and mosh pits, I let it ride. 
I love the smell of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse. 
I am so excited to be out of that waitress uniform, and back in my chic business clothes, and, you know, going to my office, where I'll probably save the day using some of my Wharton magic. 
You know, I think I like you better without hope. 
Max, you know this school is expensive, right? 
You're going in with a good attitude, right? 
No, that's what Earl's pencils are for. 
Don't worry, I'll do my best. I 
mean, look, I have a book bag. 
The only thing my mother ever sent me to school with was a note that said "Check me for lice." 
It was so sweet of everyone to give you that, even though I didn't sleep all night about it. 
And it looks kind of expensive. 
Check for a designer label. 
 Why? It's the thought that counts. 
 Since when? 
Let me see it. 
Second Avenue station. 
This is second Avenue. 
No, no, no, Max! 
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good. 
Don't let go. 
What if the train starts to leave and my arms pop off? 
How will I go to pastry school? 
I'll be one of those people decorating cookies with a bag in their mouth. 
You are the devil. 
The devil. 
You have nothing. 
Pull, Max, pull! 
Pull it from the devil! 
Can't. 
The devil works out. 
My bag. 
My blouse. 
My weed. 
Oh, great, look. Class has started. 
My new life already blows. 
Oh, look. There's chef Gorgeous. 
I don't want him to see me like this. 
I'm gonna go to the restroom and see if cold water can get out any of the stain. 
Go, Max. 
But I don't have my chef coat or book bag. 
I know I only had them for a couple of hours, but it was the best part of me. 
You'll do great. 
First, do me a favor. 
Check me for lice. 
This course is designed to introduce you to the skills and techniques required in the production of yeast bread, short pastry doughs, custards, pate a choux, and cake batters. 
Chef Max, you are late. 
Wait, are sure class doesn't start at 10:17? 
Sorry, I got robbed on the subway by some jerk. 
Hey, hey, hey, I'm right here. 
I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna strip my way through pastry school. 
That's an option? 
All right, chefs. 
Let's focus. 
Did he say he wants to "foke us"? 
___ Morning, Bebe. 
Hi. Oh, my God. 
What happened to you? 
And I should tell you my doctor says I'm not allowed to hear bad news for another month. 
I apologize for my appearance. 
We got robbed on the subway, and then someone hit me with hot coffee. 
Then, I went to wash cold water on the stain and somehow wound up entering myself in a wet T-shirt contest. 
Um, that's a lot of energy for me, so I'm just gonna need to sit here for a second and be quiet. 
I know we're being quiet, which I'm all about, but cute dogs. 
Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels. 
I rescue them. 
You know, people rescue greyhounds and pit bulls, but everyone ignores the cocker spaniel. 
They're like, "Ew, eye goo. 
Shoot it." 
I have three cockers. 
Do you have any pets? 
I have a horse, Chestnut. 
He's a thoroughbred. 
Well, what can I do first? 
What's this? 
Why am I holding a juice menu? 
Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice for the students and the staff. 
What a treat. Fresh juice is such a scam 
unless someone else is payin'. 
I'll take the Greens number three. 
Uh-huh, well, put it on the list when you get the other ones. 
Wait, I'm supposed to get the juice? 
Oh, boy, it's like I'm a bad news machine. 
Oh. Okay. 
Happy to do it. 
Surprised, but happy. 
Uh, maybe I could change into one of those cute chef jackets. 
Oh, chef Nicholas only permits pastry chefs to wear these. 
But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this. 
I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl. 
I have some workout clothes you can wear. 
Don't worry. 
I haven't worn them yet. 
But I will someday. 
Hi. 
Hi, everyone. 
I'm here to take the fresh juice orders and also to say this is not what I came to work in. 
What I came to work in had less eyes. 
Caroline, welcome. 
How is it going in the office so far? 
So great, and so not what I came to work in. 
I'm usually wearing Chanel, not le chien. 
That's "dog" in French. 
Oh, 'cause it's "dork" in English. 
Well, it is lovely to see both of your faces. 
Class, we start with the basics. 
No, no, no, you in the back... 
Juice, miss? Care for a juice from 
someone who scored 1560 on her SATs? 
You can score more than 500? 
Why the hell are you wearing that? 
I didn't think your chest could get any sadder. 
It's Bebe's. 
Max, taking juice orders is not what I came here to do. 
I hear you. 
I'll have the Ruby red. 
I always keep the edge clean, so when I'm squeezing it, it's not gonna have cream popping all over the place. 
Words to live by. 
I have the opposite problem. 
Yo, my cream's poppin' right now. 
What are you doing? You told me 
you were gonna take school seriously. 
It's not me. That guy's a bad influence. 
Look at him. 
He looks like someone who sells drugs on Sesame Street. 
You're gonna get in trouble, and I am not wearing a cocker spaniel so you can get kicked out of class. 
Right. I hear you. 
Now, where's my juice? 
Hey, chef Max. 
Check out my technique. 
Awesome gross sound bonus. 
Chef, if you find this so funny, why don't you take a fiver? 
Isn't this how your saying goes? 
I don't have a saying, but if I did, it'd be more like "Eatin' ain't cheatin'." 
Anyone else who finds something hilarious can also go into the hall. 
 Chef Max? 
 Nope, nothing 'ilarious. Teach on. 
Enough with the dirty jokes. 
We are all here to become master bakers. 
Master-baking is something I work really hard at it. 
 To be a master baker... 
 I'll be in the hall. 
 Hi, I'm Deke. 
 Did you say "freak?" 
 Deke. 
 Did you say "geek?" 
Deke, as in "Big Deke." 
Mine's bigger. 
We should be lab partners. 
Come on. It'll be bitchin'. 
Max and Deke, making cakes. 
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, with a special performance by Creed. 
Okay, now stop, stop, stop. 
I am trying to be a good student, so you just stay away from me. 
You are a bad influence. 
And I know I nailed that speech 'cause kids at school used to say it to me all the time. 
 Time to change your tampon? 
 Yep. 
Day two. 
Serious flow. 
Killer Fanny pack. 
Where's your tribal poncho? 
Ah, keep my needles in this. 
You're a drug addict too? 
God. You are irresistible. 
It's... it's insulin. 
I'm a diabetic. 
A diabetic pastry chef. 
Wow, you're even more self-destructive than me. 
So diabetes, how is that? 
Disappointing. 
I put in for syphilis. 
Stop laughing. I have to carry 
27 juices 2 blocks wearing this. 
Why'd you let the dog lady talk to you like that? 
She's my friend, even in that shirt. 
Well, there goes another $12. 
I have spent more money dry cleaning this blouse than I have on health care. 
Health care? You mean that box of 
band-aids we got at the 99 cent store? 
I just have to look good tomorrow. 
Today was mortifying. 
They called me "Sad dog" at the juice place. 
"Sad dog, your juices are ready." 
Sad dog, pick up. 
Can you take these to table ten? 
I'm backed up on the booths. 
Can you? I'm kind of just 
sitting here a minute, enjoying not being told what to do. 
I get enough of it at that school. 
Look. 
If you're gonna do the martyr thing, do it right. 
Stick your hand in boiling oil or even more painful, binge-watch Shahs of Sunset on Bravo. 
I need to talk to you in the kitchen now. 
Leave, someone's about to get schooled about school. 
This looks like it's going to get dirty and ugly. 
May I film it? 
And if so, may I then sell it on the Internet? 
 Look. You can't just do this for me. 
 You're right. So we're out? 
No, we're not out, you said you were gonna do this for me. 
I know, but you just said I can't just do it for you, and I agree. 
 I mean, who was I kidding? 
 Me. You were kidding me. 
I went in there thinking I was gonna use my business skills, and whatever hope I had of a flirtation with Frenchie McFrench went out the window when he saw me wearing that t-shirt that said, "Don't forget to spay and neuter me." 
Fine, I can quit. 
It's fine. 
 It is? Really? 
 No, it's not fine. 
 Who am I kidding? 
 Me. You were kidding me. 
Well, you've gotta figure out something there to keep you interested, because you can't go to pastry school just for me, and I'm not gonna not go to pastry school for you. 
Okay. You're right, Max. 
Of course I'll do it for you. 
I just had a bad day. 
I mean, we both did. 
You lost your man's briefcase and your drugs, and I lost my dignity and a possible love interest. 
Surprise! 
See, that's how it's supposed to go. 
 We got you a new book bag. 
 Yeah, and a new chef's jacket. 
And a switchblade. 
Yeah, 'cause we're not buyin' another chef's jacket. 
Max, you know what this means? 
That I got two surprises, and you got nothing? 
No, that everything's gonna work out at that school. 
I mean, in the blink of an eye, just like this, things can change from bad to good. 
Well, not totally good. They still 
haven't gotten me anything. 
Caroline, you didn't not get anything. 
Here, your very own pencil case. 
But no pencils. 
My pencil dealer got busted. 
Aw. 
Thank you, guys. 
I'm touched. 
I was not expecting it. 
Really? 'Cause you kinda 
bullied us all into it. 
So that's a 780 on verbal, and a 780 on math. 
And with my degree in finance, jackass-ing around the city getting juice could be seen as a waste of my talents. 
And as the valedictorian at my graduation said... 
and I'm stealin' from myself here, "I've seen the future of finance, and it's us." 
 So you want me to get the juices? 
 Just for today. Please? 
Meringue cookies are a simple way to practice our pastry bag technique. 
Hm, interesting technique you got going there, chef. 
Dude, we gotta ditch these deadbeat partners. 
I'm stuck over there with grandma. 
No, I'm staying with the big guy next to me. 
He's not gonna get me in trouble. 
He never talks. Get outta here. 
 Go back to your own table, Fat Albert. 
 Okay. I'm going back. 
And the Fat Albert thing was 'cause I'm black, not fat, right? 
'Cause I go to the gym two, three times a year. 
I hear talking, but no baking up front. 
No, no, no, you only hear baking. 
Just furiously master-baking up here. 
The meringue needs to have nice peaks. 
You are looking to make moist, pointy peaks. 
I like to pinch them. 
Chef, seriously, man-to-man, we got a problem. 
I don't think Max should be stuck with that big guy. He's not cool. 
I was just over there, and the only pointy peaks he's interested in are hers. 
Talkin' boobies here, chef. 
Chef John, chef Deke here seems to think you are sexually harassing Max. 
Oh, please. 
If I was harassing anyone, it would be you, chef. 
I mean, come on. 
 Be right back, Big Mary. 
 You know it. 
 Where's my juice? It's been an hour. 
 The mood swing elf's getting them. 
Look, I'm coming in there to flirt with chef Nicholas, and when I enter, I need you to say, "Caroline, you look amazing." 
No. 
I actually physically can't say that. 
I would rather walk in there and yell, "I have crabs, and three of them just escaped." 
Call 9-1-1. 
Call 9-1-1. 
Something's happened to the adorable mixed-race one. 
Deke? 
He's diabetic. 
He needs Insulin. 
Has anyone here ever administered a needle? 
Uh, administer means the same thing as "shove it in," right? 
Good, good, good, Max. 
Come, come, come. 
Okay, uh, his syringes are in his fanny pack. 
I've actually never done this without Iron Maiden playing in the background, but I'll give it a shot. 
Just put it anywhere in my hot bod. 
God help us. 
 Oh, I hate needles. I can't look. 
 Oh. 
Get it together, ladies. 
This is why I'm not allowed to hold babies. 
Max, I think you and Deke should be lab partners from now on, in case something like this happens again. 
 Is that okay? 
 I guess if I have to. 
Max? 
I guess if I have to. 
Oh, mon Dieu! 
What, did you not take your Insulin on purpose? 
I really wanted to be your partner. 
Bebe, I can't find a chef jacket anywhere in here. 
And I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to wear one, but I'm really cold, and I can't walk around like this all day. 
Maybe I can help. 
You can't stand there wet and cold. 
Take my jacket. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
You don't have... 
oh, that'll work. 
I'm sorry about the no shirt under, but I just get so hot when I'm teaching. 
Yeah, hot. 
So hot. 
Oh mon Dieu. 
I was just giving it to Caroline. 
I mean, she needs something to wear, and... and now, she has it. 
Chef, I will see you later. 
Caroline... 
Max, I think I found something to keep me interested. 
This is weird. 
So I'm the good student now? 
And you're the one sleeping with the teacher? 
We're not sleeping together. 
Why? Do you think he wants to? 
I don't know, but you better hurry it up before Big Mary gets him. 
﻿1  Max? 
 No. 
Don't come over here with that "I'm the boss, "you're the waitress" look. 
Cause I could just as easily give you the "I'm the murderer, "you're the victim" look. 
The muscular woman at table two is sending her bagel back. 
She said she ordered a plain one. 
I'm sorry, did you say she wanted a multi-grain? 
No, plain. 
Whole grain? 
No, plain. 
Garlic? 
No. 
The plain! The plain! 
It took me two years, but I finally got him to say it. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Are you telling me you don't hear that cat? 
We have to let it in. 
It's clearly a stray, or this Marine I met last week at a blood drive. 
Last week there was a man outside our door screaming, "I've been stabbed," and all you did was yell, "Shut up." 
Because he said, "I think I've been stabbed." 
You're either stabbed, or you're not stabbed, my friend Listen, it sounds like the cat's saying hello. 
Hello, hello. 
Listen, it's talking. 
It's saying, "Help. 
Can I come in?" 
Really? 
'Cause I think it's saying, "I'm fine. 
Go back to sleep." 
Come on, it clearly just said, "Let me in. 
Ignore the blonde. 
She's a bitch." 
Look, you can't just let in everything that shows up at our door and says hello. 
Yeah, I can. 
I've done it. 
Max, we can't. 
We can't become cat ladies. 
And it always starts out innocently, rescuing a stray, but then you have to get another one so that they can entertain each other while you're at work. 
And then somewhere along the line, four more sneak in, and you think, "We're good. 
We're cool. 
We're the cute girls with six cats." 
And then, one day, there you are on Animal Cops, screaming, "Don't take my babies! 
These 27 angels is all I got!" 
That's how it goes, Max. 
Once you get one, you get 27. 
Not true. 
Really? 
How many garden gnomes do you have under your bed? 
27. 
What? 
They understand I'm only keeping them there until I get a yard. 
Come on. 
I want a kitty. 
Kitty for Max. 
Kitty for Max. 
Max, we already have a horse. 
We can't afford another animal. 
We're broke. 
Come on. 
Chestnut needs a friend. 
He is dying to trash us to someone, and all he's got is that rat who is super self-involved. 
Who the hell is that? 
It's so late. 
It's probably the cat, or the guy who's raping girls in Brooklyn. 
Open the door, and roll the dice. 
Oh, please. 
Please, somebody tell me they killed that damn cat. 
And where did it learn how to say hello? 
Told you. 
It's been keeping me up all night. 
This poor cat has been crying at our door every night trying to get in, trying to get a little warm milk, maybe a skosh of tuna. 
Max, that's our dinner tomorrow. 
Wait. 
Be careful. 
A cat is not always a cat. 
Oh, please continue. 
In Poland, we believe if you die outside, you're reincarnated as a cat. 
Am I the only one who thinks Poland sounds like a real freak show? 
So never let a cat in, because it's just a person that's been reincarnated and will bring in all the bad jus. 
I think you mean juju. 
Oh, do I? 
Nighty-night. 
Look, we just have to put up with it, and after a while, it'll go away on its own. 
Go away on its own? 
It's a stray cat, not my father. 
Good night, Max. 
Fine. 
No kitty for Max. 
No kitty for Max. 
See, Max, I told you the cat would stop. 
Max? 
Max. 
Can we keep it, ma? 
Can we keep it? 
Earl, you don't want a cat, do you? 
A cat? 
God, no. 
Cats steal your weed. 
See, Caroline? 
Nobody wants the cat. 
We're keeping it, and I think we should start celebrating right meow. 
Max, you didn't even try to convince him. 
Come on, Earl. 
Don't you want a cat? 
Kitty for Earl. 
Kitty for Earl. 
I'm too old to have a cat. 
I'm about six months away from crapping in a box myself. 
Oleg, how do you feel about cats? 
Loved it. 
Saw it nine times on Broadway. 
Very clever show, but a little expensive. 
The most I've ever paid to see a pussy dance. 
So far we're keeping the cat. 
Hey, Han, do you want a cat? 
You could finally have a friend your own size. 
Come on, you could ride it to work. 
No, I can't have a cat. 
They're lazy, moody, and judgmental. 
I don't need another you. 
Plus, they don't show affection. 
Sure they do. 
You just have to know how to get it out of them. 
Cats love to be lightly spanked on their bottom. 
I don't understand why a cat would like that. 
It's so mysterious. 
Kitty. Kitty. 
Kitty-kitty-kitty. 
Kitty. Kitty. 
Kitty-kitty-kitty. 
Hmm. 
Well, I can't have a cat. 
I work all the time. 
Why did I like that so much? 
I don't know. 
Something with boobs was touching you. 
People with boobs touch me. 
She means aside from your mom. 
Then, no. 
Well, we've asked everyone we know, and now I'm depressed, because this is everyone we know. 
Let's start asking people in the diner. 
We need to find it a place to live. 
Why? 
Why can't it live right here in my arm in between my hot and naturals? 
Kitty. Kitty. 
Kitty-kitty-kitty. 
I have to admit, that does feel kind of good. 
Excuse me. 
I overheard you two asking people if they want a cat, and I'd really love one. 
Really? 
Well, we have your cat. 
Whoa. Whoa. 
Not so fast. 
I got a couple of questions first. 
Do you smoke? 
Yes. 
 Drink? 
 Yes. 
Prescription drugs. 
Occasionally. 
Forget the cat. 
Will you take me home? 
Kitty, you're gonna love this lady. 
She smokes, drinks, does prescription drugs, which we all know means Oxy. 
Hi. 
Oh, my God. 
These she is. 
She's purr-fect. 
Come in. 
Welcome home, you. 
See, Max? 
It's great. 
What the hell is going on in here? 
Look at all these cats crammed in this little space. 
It's so sad. 
The only thing missing is Sarah McLachlan singing in the corner. 
What? 
It's fine. 
There's not that many. 
They're attacking! 
Sorry. 
He loves blondes. 
And apparently pooping on the carpet. 
No, Twinkles, no. 
Oh, okay, quick introductions. 
That's Bethany, Radford, Cellars, Franklin, Eleanor, Pudding, Mustachio, Mitzi, Meredith, Baxter, Bernie. 
She remembers all of their names? 
I don't even remember the name of the guy I lost my virginity to. 
Best I can do is "Coach" something. 
Well, Catherine, I think it's lovely that you have such a big, loving hairy family, kind of like the Kardashians. 
There's only 24. 
Oh. 
31. 
Let's go before one of these rabid cats bites us and we become half-human, half-cat hybrids who wander the streets but are never cold. 
We're just gonna go have a little conversation in the hall. 
And F.Y.I., 
the mother looks like she's eating the little one. 
Just a thought. 
I'm only saying that 'cause it's in her mouth. 
Mitzi, release! 
Let's go! 
In less than five minutes, it went from 24 to 31, and I saw two cats in the corner doing it doggie style, so in two months, we could be looking at 50 cats. 
Max, you can't get pregnant doggie style. 
Right? 
We can't go back in. 
There's so much hair in there, I saw a cat using a lint roller. 
Okay, but if we don't leave her here, we only have one other option. 
No, Kitty is not going to a shelter. 
Why? 
Lots of cats get adopted and end up in beautiful homes. 
Look, I didn't want to say this, but she's not pretty enough. 
What are you talking about? 
She's not pretty enough. 
Come on, she doesn't have classic good looks, but she's adorkable. 
We cannot take her to a shelter. 
She'll die there. 
And, yeah, everyone says they want one with a nice personality, but they really just want a hot, sexy, young kitten who still gets excited about balls in her face. 
Everything okay, ladies? 
No, everything is far from okay. 
My boots are now UGGs, thanks to all the cat hair in there. 
Ow! 
Stop it! 
Sorry, that's Gina. 
She's bipolar, and she refuses to take her meds. 
Ow! Ow! 
Stop it, Gina! 
I'm sorry, Catherine. 
This isn't gonna work out. 
It's nothing personal. 
It's just that you're crazy. 
Truly, I'm heartbroken. 
Ow! Ow! 
I already have a name picked out for her. 
Veronica Two. 
Ow! Stop it! 
Ow! Ow! 
I got to go! 
Who wants to eat? 
Um, just so we all know, Veronica One committed suicide, right? 
Kitty, we're gonna find you a nice home. 
Want a cat? 
Free cat? 
Want a cat? 
You are going to love it here. 
Park Slope is like the Beverly Hills of Brooklyn. 
Here comes a good one. 
Hey. 
Want a cat. 
Excuse me? 
Cat? 
Yeah, I'll take some crack. 
She said "cat." 
We're looking for a nice home for a cat. 
Oh, so no crack. 
No. 
Well, why would I want a cat? 
I'm a crackhead. 
Well, Kitty, as hard as this is, I think it's time to let you back out there into the world. 
At least we leave you in a rich neighborhood; you'll have a better shot at life. 
Max, you are okay with this? 
Well, I was more okay when I did this with my cousin's baby. 
There you go. 
Oh, yeah. 
Move him to the next house. 
South-facing sun. 
Pre-war building. 
She'll love it. 
There you go. 
You live in Park Slope now. 
You can adopt an African baby and wheel it around in a $900 stroller. 
Can you believe that was my plan "B"? 
Run! 
Run away. 
Go. 
Ah, screw it. 
She lives here now. 
Ooh. Look. 
They have a piano. 
You can make videos. 
You'll be a YouTube star. 
Bye, Kitty. 
Wow, I'm shocked you didn't stop me. 
Stop you? 
If I had known that was option, I would have had you stuff me in there. 
I wonder what Kitty's doing in her fancy town house right now. 
She's probably snuggling with an older gay guy who likes to read. 
You know, 'cause gay guys are the only ones who still read. 
They're probably on the couch right now with A Tale of Two Kitties. 
I'm proud of us. 
We selflessly gave that cat a better life than we could ever afford for ourselves. 
Oh, don't try to get in on that. 
I did the right thing. 
You tried to leave her at that crazy lady's pussy riot. 
Hi. Excuse me. 
Would it be okay if I put this flier next to your window? 
No. 
Sure. 
We lost our cat, Jinxy, like, a week ago in this neighborhood. 
Have you seen her? 
No. No. 
I haven't seen a cat in a long time. 
I was just saying to her yesterday, "I haven't seen a cat in a long time." 
Um, how come you didn't have a collar on her? 
And where's her I.D. tag? 
Even my mother had an I.D. tag on me. 
Well, it was a flea collar, but... 
Why did it take you so long to put the signs up? 
Um, what's happening? 
Um, here's what's happening: We are more than happy to put up this flier of your cat, which we have never, ever seen. 
I mean, seriously, where did all the cats go? 
Queens? 
Staten Island? 
'Cause they're not in this neighborhood. 
Okay. 
This was weird. 
Is there any way this cat isn't Kitty? 
Nope, that's her. 
Same green eyes, same notch in the ear. 
Hello. 
Hello. 
Oh, God. 
Oh, God. 
Hey, girls. 
What's shaking? 
Not me, 'cause I'm all held in. 
Sorry, Sophie, the cupcake window isn't open during the day. 
I don't need your life story. 
I just need a damn cupcake. 
Sophie, do you remember that cat that was crying outside our building? 
Yeah, you put it down? 
We thought it was a stray, so we tried to find a home for it, but couldn't. 
So you put it down. 
No. 
We left it in a really nice neighborhood. 
Oh, so a rich person put it down? 
It turns out it wasn't a stray at all. 
We just met its owner. 
This is the cat, Sophie. 
Her name's Jinxy. 
Oh, wait a minute. 
Wait a minute. 
You remember how I told you that if you die outside in Poland, you come back as a cat? 
Yeah, that's kind of hard to forget. 
That's not Jinxy. 
That's my friend Nancy. 
Look at her. 
Same green eyes, same notch in the ear. 
Same whiskers. 
I don't think that this is Nancy. 
Oh, yes. 
She and I got in a big fight and how she's come back to haunt me. 
She died waiting for an apology from me, and now she's back. 
Guess what. 
She's not gonna get it. 
Jinxy! 
Jinxy! 
Jinxy, come on, girl. 
Look, I said on the phone, this area is where we randomly spotted her. 
I wonder how Jinxy got all the way to Park Slope. 
Just wait. 
She's here, I promise. 
Jinxy! 
Jinxy! 
Nancy. 
Nancy! 
Nancy! 
Nancy! 
Nancy! 
Come on, Nancy! 
Nancy, it's Sophie! 
I'm here to apologize! 
Um, what's happening? 
Oh, my God. 
It's Nancy. 
I mean, Jinxy. 
I mean, Kitty. 
Ooh... 
Hello. 
Hello. 
Hi, baby. 
Kitty, kitty. 
Kitty-kitty-kitty. 
What she's doing, they like it. 
I know, because I liked it. 
Anyway, we found your cat. 
Isn't that great? 
Actually, she's my boyfriend's cat. 
I'm keeping her. 
Max, just close your eyes and look away, like you do whenever those people ask you if you have a minute to save the earth. 
Just stick it in here. 
"Just stick it in here"? 
That's what I say when my hand gets tired. 
Maxy. Maxy. 
Maxy, Maxy, Maxy. 
Now do me. 
First of all, I own the diner now. 
Secondly, don't ever do that again. 
I guess I'll just have to spank myself. 
No surprise there. 
I hope you're happy. 
I found Jinxy's owners on Facebook. 
Not one pic of Kitty, not even a status update saying, "We found our cat." 
But she is more than willing to talk about her reverse French manicure and posts pictures of a meal I know she's gonna make herself throw up later. 
Come on, Max. 
There's got to be one photo of Kitty. 
Oh, wow. 
You found one? 
No, that manicure is heaven. 
Max, photos or not, we need to focus on the fact that the cat is back with the guy who loves her. 
The guy who loves her? 
He doesn't love Kitty. 
If he did, why aren't there any pictures of her at his first wedding? 
What, he couldn't spring for a cat tuxedo? 
They're, like, 20 bucks. 
I know because I have one on my garden gnome. 
This is not a loving home. 
Pics, or it didn't happen. 
Okay, Max. 
Okay, just say it. 
I put the cat in an abusive home. 
You put the cat in an abusive home. 
I have a gift for you. 
No way! 
No way! 
Oh, yeah, it's Jinxy. 
It's Nancy. 
Jinxy was her slave name. 
Oh, Nancy, I missed you. 
I missed you so much. 
What did you do? 
How did you get her? 
Well, it was really complicated. 
I went to their apartment, and I said, "You don't love that cat," and they said, "You're right. Take it." 
Oh, my God! 
Is this what happiness feels like? 
So what made you change your mind? 
Because two years ago I was outside your door, saying, "Hello. Hello." 
And you let me in, and it changed my life. 
That's kind of different, though, because I didn't want to let you in, and I did want to let the cat in. 
But you did let me in. 
You let me in, and you gave me food and shelter and love. 
Not the way I wanted to give to the cat. 
Max, are you trying to equate a person's love with a cat's love? 
Not really. 
A cat's love is eternal. 
Hey, girls. 
I'm heading over to the bodega salad bar. 
They just added hot ribs and a sneeze guard. 
You need anything? 
Sophie, we got the cat back. 
She was in a house where she wasn't wanted. 
Oh, yeah. 
That is so Nancy. 
Sophie, do you want to see the cat? 
She's in the apartment? 
No, no, no. 
No, no. 
I can't see her right now! 
It's too much! 
I'm happy for you, Nancy! 
But I can't do this right now! 
Wait, where did the cat go? 
Oh, no, Chestnut. 
I left the back door open. 
Oh, my God. 
Look. 
She's on top of Chestnut. 
They like each other. 
Why wouldn't they? 
She's a foxy redhead, and he's a stud. 
You did the right thing. 
Kitty, kitty. 
Kitty-kitty-kitty. 
Why do I like that so much? 
'Cause something with boobs is touching you? 
﻿1 Max, that car has been parked outside for a week now. 
Do you think they're selling drugs? 
Let me rephrase that. 
Are they selling drugs to you? 
No. They're not 
buying, either. 
Hi. We have a new 
mochaccino cupcake. 
Oh, no. No, no, no. 
That car's not with us. 
Well, that's the third customer that didn't stop because of that rap car. 
To be fair, this place wasn't Walmart on Black Friday before the car showed up. 
I'm gonna go ask it to move. 
Cool. I'll tell your horse 
you died brave. 
Stupid, but brave. 
At least take this pan, and cover the part you wanna get shot in the least. 
Hi. Can I talk to you 
for a second? 
I need to see your head at all times. 
First of all, they're obsessed with me. 
Second of all, I handled it. 
Have I been shot? 
Season 3, Episode 14 "And the Dumpster Sex" Well, I did it. 
I saved the neighborhood. 
You had a car towed. You didn't 
burn down the Bed, Bath & Beyond. 
It wasn't the blue one with the tinted windows, aka, the murder car? 
Aka, the murder car? 
Tell me that's the name of the make and model, like, "The Toyota murder". 
Are you sure you're not thinking of the Honda stabbing? 
Caroline, some guy stopped by asking for you with a festive bandana and a teardrop tattoo. 
A festive bandana and a teardrop tattoo... 
are you sure it wasn't my mother? 
He said he wanted to talk to you about his car, so I gave him your number. 
 Han! 
 I thought he was your friend. 
I don't have friends with tattoos. 
I don't even have friends with split ends. 
You gave a stranger my number. 
Your number, your email, and your address. 
What? 
You're a busy girl. 
I didn't know the best way for him to reach you. 
Oh, my God. 
Max, am I in trouble? 
Pick-up, dead meat. 
What does that mean? 
It means it's never a good idea to have a car with tinted windows towed. 
That's rule number one. 
I thought rule number one was, "Always wipe front to back." 
 Max, I'm worried. 
 Me too. 
I thought it was back to front. 
What's up, Nat King Cool? 
Hey, my brother from a Jewish mother. 
Hey, my daddy that just smoked a fatty. 
Oh, look, Max, it's your boyfriend. 
He's not my boyfriend. 
We just made out. 
I make out with people all the time. 
I made out with a guy in the diner last week. 
That wasn't making out. 
He was choking, and you gave him mouth-to-mouth. 
Yeah, but it led to sex. 
Go away. 
Hey, Max, I came in to ask you something. 
They're natural, and they hurt my back. 
I also wanted to know if you want to hang tomorrow night. 
We could watch TV with our shirts off. 
Maybe. And I'll buy you 
some dinner if you put out. 
Ooh, so like a date. 
I'm willing to throw $10, $15 at this thing. 
You want to throw $15 at my thing? 
Great. 
I usually charge $5. 
You came all the way here to ask me out? 
I'm old-fashioned. Plus, 
I dropped my phone in the toilet. 
 See ya tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
Now go. 
I have a job to not do. 
 Okay. 
 Go, idiot. 
Okay, dummy. 
Okay, Han, I can't hold you up anymore. 
Max, I think I just saw the murder car go by, out the bathroom window. 
 What exactly did you see? 
 A car. 
No, seriously, I think it followed me home. 
Well, three years ago, you followed me home, so we're even. 
There you go, Nancy. 
Okay, I'm off on my date. 
You can't leave me here alone. 
There's a murder car out there. 
 Relax. No one is after you. 
 Oh, really? 
What about the person who yelled, "Watch yo back, bitch", when we were walking home? 
That was me, to that girl scout. 
If you tell someone you're carrying thin mints, you best be carrying thin mints. 
Max, you're coming back tonight, right? 
I'm kind of afraid. I've never 
been here alone at night. 
If you don't want to be alone, why don't you call Han? 
Very funny. 
I did. Han's busy. 
He's going to a country square dance on Second Life. 
It's an online game, but he says it's more of a lifestyle. 
Don't you have to have a first life to have a second life? 
Max, please stay. 
Call Deke and cancel, or else you might come home to find me in a pool of blood. 
Oh, I always wanted a pool. 
Oh, no, it's them, here to kill me. 
It couldn't be. I haven't paid 
them all the money yet. 
Oh, hi, girls. 
You know, I just came from the dentist's office. 
Did you know that Michael Jackson died? 
Oh, and Farrah Fawcett too? 
Oh, no, I've got to sit down. 
Well, since you're here, do you want to stay and have a girls' night? 
Oh, that's sounds like fun. 
It's just me and you. 
Max has a date. 
And Caroline's afraid to be alone. 
Well, if you don't want to be alone, then why do you act the way you do? 
I got to go meet Deke. 
We are going out to get wasted, hopefully to the point of blowing chunks on each other's shoes. 
But imagine it a little less romantic than it sounds. 
Well, Caroline, it's just me and you. 
 I know. I thought it'd be fun if... 
 Well, we tried. 
Good night. 
Don't go. Dangerous 
people are after me. 
You know, in Poland, when the Cossacks came, we would boil water and then throw it in their faces, and then make soup. 
Anyway, have a good one. 
Wait. 
Hello? 
Rula? Yes. 
No, I have absolutely nothing to do tonight. 
Well, Nancy, looks like it's just you and me. 
Yep, you and me and this magazine from 2009. 
Ah, 2009... The last year 
I had anything. 
Let's see, Nancy. 
What are we gonna read here? 
"New York City, more dangerous than ever." 
Okay, that's it. 
We're done. 
That's just a horn, right? 
Or is it a signal? 
No offense, Nancy, but we really need a dog in this situation. 
Oh, guess what. We happen 
to be in my neighborhood. 
Oh, you are smooth. 
Also, you aggressively steered me here and stopped at a bodega to buy me condoms. 
So you want to come back to my place, and... 
 Brown chicken brown cow?  
Brown chicken what? 
You know, "Bowm chicka bowm bowm," but I made it... 
 Brown chicken, brown cow  So you thought of that in your head, and your brain was like, "That's okay to say"? 
No, my brain was like "don't say it, don't say it, don't say it, don't say it". 
And then it was... 
 Brown chicken, brown cow  Well, this is me. 
What do you want me to say... 
"Congratulations. You live in a building"? 
No, that would be lame. 
I don't live in a building. I live here. 
 Where? All I see is a dumpster. 
  Yeah, it's my apartment. 
I converted it, and I live inside. 
It's totally green. 
I mean, it's horrible for the environment, but it's the color green. 
Oh, you're not kidding. 
You live in a dumpster? 
This is usually the part where the girl says she has to be up early tomorrow or call the police. 
So do you have to go? 
Yeah. 
I have to go inside the freakin' cool dumpster. 
And if you think it's cool now, watch this. 
My dumpster's a grower, not a show-er. 
Holy crap. 
This is amazing. 
You have a sink in here and a stove. 
Is it heated in here, or did you teach the rats to shovel coal into the engine? 
Yes, but there's also solar panels on the roof and a microwave and a bathroom right here. 
You have a microwave next to your toilet? 
You're a genius! 
That's the smartest way to eat a burrito. 
I think of everything. 
And if you don't like your neighbors, you push your house to a new street. 
Or you could just kill them and throw their bodies in here. 
Added bonus... no rent. 
And the Chinese restaurant next door always tosses their garbage on my roof. 
Free delivery, yo. 
You don't have to tell me. 
I read all about this place in "Dumpster Living." 
I'll take it. 
All right, but it comes with a very handsome stuffed animal of a man with hair that gets him followed by security at Macy's. 
I'm not just saying this 'cause you live in a dumpster, but I'll take some... 
 Brown chicken, brown cow  Right now. 
So what was your first time having sex in a dumpster like? 
A lot like the other times I've had sex in a dumpster. 
Next time I'm gonna be naked. 
Next time I won't be wearing this hat. 
I hope you don't mind. 
 I sleep like this. 
 Aah! Get off me. 
Oh, so nice to have a live body under me for a change. 
Stop! You're crushing me! Mm. 
 This is really nice. 
 Yeah, it is. 
I got to go. 
You got to go? 
Yeah, I live, uh, all the way over by the diner. 
Plus, I got to pull these boots on. 
And I got a horse and a cat, possibly a dead roommate, so... 
Right. You got to 
be up early. 
Yeah, but not like that. 
It's just, like... 
Where's the door handle? 
Is it the coffee pot? 
I can't get out. I'm used to 
climbing out of these things. 
Ah, it's right here. 
Oh. Sure you 
don't wanna stay? 
Chinese restaurant just delivered. 
There's that horn again. There 
is no way this is not about us. 
Max, it's me again. Why do you even have 
a phone if you're not gonna pick it up? 
And also, you are a grown lady. 
Why is your outgoing message a fart? 
And I am sure you're in the middle of having very silly sex, but it is a nightmare around here. 
Chestnut, Nancy, and I are all convinced that the murder car is still circling and about to take us all out. 
So self-involved. 
This water is taking forever to boil. 
The best I could do now is offer the killers warm tea before they dismember me. 
That'd be funny if you got jokes. 
Okay, guys, here's the plan. 
If they come in that door, we go out this door. 
If they come in that door, Chestnut, you block them, and, Nancy, you go for their eyes. 
You know what? Let's just 
say our good-byes now. 
Boil, boil, boil. 
No time! 
Whoever you are, I have a pot of pretty hot water! 
Wha... oh! 
What is all this junk? 
My legs! 
My beautiful legs! 
Ow, ow. Ow, ow. Ow, ow. 
I burned my toe cleavage. 
And it's the only cleavage I have. 
If it helps, your toes do look bigger. 
Thank God I have these flip-flops I used to wear in your shower before I gave up. 
Yes, hi, I have a complete emergency. 
My legs are burned. 
Okay, I hear you. 
I'll put you right behind the guy whose legs just came off. 
Thank you. 
I appreciate that. 
See, I just got burned with pretty hot water, and I wear a lot of peep-toe shoes. 
 Insurance provider? 
 I'd like to use my Obamacare. 
Oh, Obamacare? 
Why didn't you say so? 
Come right in. 
What is the problem? 
We're all entitled to Obamacare. 
That's what that Rachel Maddow guy said. 
I'll need more information than that. 
Password, Malia? 
You clowns need to figure out your insurance information and come back to me in about two hours when I'm on my sofa, drinking whiskey out of a coffee mug. 
 Max, let's just sit. 
 They have to take us, by law. 
I know because I used to complain about that. 
Max, can you take that flu season pamphlet and fan my feet? 
No. 
I'm not touching anything in here, 'cause I was never vaccinated... 
Or loved. 
 Who is it? 
 It's Deke. 
You're not gonna answer it? 
No, right now, I am very concerned about your legs. 
Aw. You're lying. 
What happened between you and Deke? 
Why did you even come home tonight? 
Was the sex bad? 
Did you hit him? 
No, the sex was fine. 
Actually, it was better than fine. 
It was great and I wanted to stay. 
 So...? 
 So I left immediately. 
Max, don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you found someone who finally makes you happy and you're trying to ruin it. 
Oh, that's what this feeling is. 
Well, I got to get rid of it. 
 Why? 
 I wasn't raised to be happy. 
I was raised to believe canned meat is as good as it gets. 
Ow, ow. Ow, ow. 
Ow, ow. 
Earl, I spilled hot water on my feet. 
You can't imagine how much pain I'm in. 
Well, I kicked heroin in a 7/11 bathroom for three days. 
But sorry about your burnt tootsies though. 
Caroline, sorry I didn't text you back. 
I would've come over last night, but my second life wife had a baby. 
I just can't believe you had fake sex nine months ago and didn't tell anyone. 
Excuse me. 
I'm looking for a skinny blonde that works here. 
Uh... She died. 
 She right over there. 
 Ooh, she came back to life! 
Hallelujah! 
Hey, I got something for you. 
No! 
 It's a mix tape. 
 No! 
I made it for you. I'm sorry 
my brother threw that cupcake at you. 
He's gluten-free and upset about it. 
So can I take you out sometime? 
Uh... uh, very sweet, 
and you seem great, but I'm already in a relationship with a guy in a red bandana. 
No worries. 
Just thought I'd ask. 
What did you just do? 
You never say no to a guy with tinted windows. 
That's rule number two. 
Well, his number's on here. 
I can always call him back. 
Then we can both be in relationships we don't want to be in. 
 Relationship? 
 Deke. 
You're gonna see him at pastry school tomorrow. He's gonna wanna know. 
Guys never wanna know. In fact, 
they are dying not to know. 
Max, why'd you leave last night? 
I wanna know. 
I mean, you were all like, "Wham-bam, thank you, man." 
And yeah, my brain was like, "don't say it, don't say it, don't say it, don't say it," but I said it. 
What's going on? 
Uh... The sex was bad. 
What about the scratches on my back? 
I was trying to get away. 
I'll just leave you two alone. 
Ow, ow. Ow, ow. 
I'll just be over here, looking at my mix tape. 
Oh, track one, "Make It Nasty." 
You're right, Max. 
The sex was bad, really bad. 
And it was worse when we did it the second time. 
And that third time was a disaster. 
I mean, I only lasted 47 minutes, and you screamed. 
Okay, walking away has to be less painful than hearing this. 
 Ow, ow, ow, ow. 
 No, stay, Caroline. We'll go outside. 
Max, come with me for a second. 
I wanna show you something. 
Just whip it out here. 
You wouldn't be the first guy to do that tonight. 
Nor will he be the last. 
Okay, what do you wanna show me? 
Is that your dumpster? 
Look, you said you couldn't stay over because you lived all the way over by the diner, so I moved it here to figure out what your next excuse would be. 
Um, I'm racist. 
Yeah, me too. 
White girls are a hassle. 
What else? 
You have a bird on your shirt. 
You love it. 
I do. 
What else? 
 I got nothin'. 
 Good. 
So what do you say you stop being such a stupid face, and get your sweet dumper into my dumpster right now, where a brown chicken and a brown cow are waiting patiently for you. 
Look. 
If you want me in that dumpster, you'll have to get me there the traditional way. 
Duct tape my wrists, throw a bag over my head, and toss me in. 
 Awful, huh? 
 So bad. 
Want to do it again later, and then sleep over tonight, and then do it again? 
Sure. 
Are we ever gonna do it naked? 
Yeah, when you move into a place big enough for me to take my pants off. 
Look, I got to warn you. 
I don't know how to be happy. 
Then why do you have that big smile on your face? 
I'm faking it. 
Why is it shaking? 
Are we still having sex? 
Thank you, sir. 
Enjoy your cupcake. 
Hey! 
Max? 
Don't tow us. 
This is Deke's house. 
He lives in a dumpster? 
Yeah, but on purpose. 
But you're coming home tonight, right? 
Max, Max! 
Han? 
Han, what are you doing tonight? 
﻿1 And... time! 
37 minutes. 
We got from the apartment to the subway to the pastry school in record time. 
I mean, I'm not wearing a bra and my thong may be on backwards. 
There's no wrong way to wear a thong, as long as it's uncomfortable. 
And with you, the bra's just for decoration. 
I have to wear one 'cause you get a ticket for not putting the kids in a car seat. 
See you in class, guys. 
I gotta say good-bye to my wife. 
 Did you think I was gonna kiss you? 
 Yes! 
I'm the wife, you're the husband, who I caught wearing my clothes one day, but I don't say anything about it... 
 Morning, guys. 
 Oh, hi, Bebe. 
Surprised to see me, right? 
Everyone always thinks I'm not gonna make it through the night, but here I am, even surprised myself. 
What's it like working in an office with someone who's about to snap like a breadstick? 
Not as much fun as you'd think. 
But Bebe's sweet, and working here is putting you through pastry school. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Bye. 
 I want a divorce. 
 I already filed. 
Season 3, Episode 11 "And the Life After Death" Hey, wife, I need $5 to pay for a spatula I broke yesterday. 
I was having a Gordon Ramsay moment. 
I'd have sex with him, by the way. 
Why? He'd just be yelling at you 
and telling you you're doing it wrong. 
Yeah, sex. 
Take it. 
It's in my purse. 
Yo, Bebe, you got any extra pills you're not taking? 
No, I'm taking them all. 
 Oh, my God, no. 
 What? I just wanted one. Or two. 
Just to take the edge off. I have 
a whipped cream final at 3:00. 
No. In the obituaries. 
I know this person. 
"Antonia Florentino, 80, died peacefully in her sleep." 
That's a suicide, right? 
She was my nanny. 
You still have a nanny? 
Lucky... 
She took care of me most of my childhood. 
 I loved her so much. 
 So sorry... 
That's kind of how I felt about my old neighbor, Carla. 
I mean, she didn't take care of me, but when I was a kid, she used to let me drink out of her hose. 
The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me and a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the Teen Choice Awards. 
Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now? 
'Cause I only do it in my car. 
Max, you know what I just realized? 
This is the first time I've been here since my nanny died. 
You just said that at Chipotle. 
And then you said it again ten minutes later, also at Chipotle. 
Show some sensitivity. I was 
crying because my nanny died. 
And also because our grief brunch was at Chipotle. 
Caroline, your nanny passed? 
My sympathies, sweetheart. 
That's a shame. 
But there is nothing better than a black funeral. 
I'm still hung over from my grandpa's in '84. 
Earl, my nanny was white. 
Your nanny was white? 
Child, you were rich. 
Have you seen Han? 
The funeral's in Philadelphia tomorrow, and I need the day off. 
Well, I think I saw him earlier, but then again, it might have been a cat. 
Hey, we both need the day off. 
I'm going with you for moral support/ my first cheese steak/ I want to ride the liberty bell like a wrecking ball. 
I just read the craziest article in this Popular Science about white dwarfs, black holes, and Uranus. 
Oh, no. 
Let me start over. 
Han, we need tomorrow off. My nanny died. 
She was like a mother to me. 
But she was not your mother. 
And diner rules clearly state you can only take off for the death of a family member. 
Well, the rules also say "No drinking on the job", but... 
Okay, yes, you can go. 
Because in my culture, it's important to honor the elderly. 
I shared a bunk bed with a 97-year-old till I was 22. 
Were you on the top or the bottom? 
Oh, I was always the bottom. 
Oh, no. 
Let me start over. 
Hey, Caroline. 
I got your nanny death text. 
So I'm wearing black out of respect. 
And also, I got my period. 
 Thanks, Sophie. That's lovely. 
 It is? Which part? 
You know, back in Poland when my nanny died, I was so heartbroken, I could barely eat her. 
You ate your dead nanny? 
Well, a goat's a goat. 
It doesn't matter what you name it. 
It's still good goat meat. 
All right, I'll be in my booth. 
I'm going to order a tuna melt and three Midol, please. 
Wait, how are we gonna get there? 
Oh, Bebe said she had a car, we can just ask her. 
I don't want to get in a car with her. 
I don't even want to get in a conversation with her. 
I can drive you. 
We just have to stop at my sister's in Bucks County, pick up an unmarked package, and swing by Connecticut to drop it off. 
Oleg, is there anything illegal about this delivery? 
No, it's just some shoes... 
Stuffed with cocaine. 
Also the shoes are made of hashish. 
I'll call Bebe. 
Okay, but I'm sitting in the back 'cause I don't want the crazy to get on me. 
Bebe, I can't thank you enough for driving us to the funeral. 
We're only going 20. 
You can go faster if you want. 
Yeah, we just got passed by a tree. 
And I'm especially thrilled your nervous cocker spaniel with gas and hot spots got to join us. 
Okay, now you're going 100. 
We can go slower if you want. 
Sorry. Extremes... 
That's my thing. 
One time I moved to Tokyo for a day. 
Max, it just hit me again. 
I know. It's like 
she feeds him broccoli. 
No. That Antonia 
is really dead. 
Well, the good news is, according to Yelp, she's dead about two blocks from the famous Philly cheese steak place. 
 Max, show some respect. 
 Well, I didn't know her. 
In fact, I only know her as the lady who brought me and cheese steaks together. 
Even though we've never met, it'll mean so much to Antonia’s family that I came out of respect. 
It'll mean so much to my therapist that I left my safe zone and only brought one of the dogs. 
Max, do you think in addition to my eulogy, I should read something from my childhood journal? 
I don't, but I think you're gonna do it anyway. 
"Christmas morning, 1997. 
"Antonia woke me up with a cup of hot cocoa" "and my favorite peppermint stick, and then we opened presents." 
Christmas morning, 1997. 
I threw cold water on my mother's face. 
New Year's day... 
Still no movement. 
This is the only picture I still have of us. 
It was our first Halloween together. 
I was four. 
Look at that cute little baby chick costume she made me. 
 Aw, so cute. 
 Car. 
I never had a Halloween costume. 
I used to put my hair in a messy bun and stumble from door-to-door telling people I was my mother. 
This Halloween, I went as my doctor, Michael. 
And I dressed up my buddy here as his lover, Joseph. 
We lost. 
Antonia was always there for me... 
Halloween, Christmas, Easter... 
Every holiday. 
Really, every day. 
 She was really like a mother to me. 
 Where was your real mother? 
Hey, what kind of dog is that? 
I mean, besides "sad"? 
Her mother had an affair, got pushed out. 
That's her hot spot, so don't lick it. 
It's okay, Max, I don't need any protection. 
You don't need protection? 
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated? 
Bebe, yes, my mother was unfaithful to my father, so she was sent away. 
But I had Antonia and she took care of me. 
She was my family. 
That must have been hard. 
Everybody needs a mother. 
I'd be crazy without my mother. 
She drives me to all my appointments. 
But you drive. 
Yeah... 
But I'm not supposed to. 
It's okay I asked Bebe to wait in the car, right? 
I mean, she'll be okay. 
We cracked a window. 
Yeah, and she's got a bowl and a chew-toy. 
Come on, let's sign in. 
Max, I have to keep it together when I meet the family. 
I can't be all emotional. 
Look, my hand's shaking. 
This is terrible. 
What? It was 
a terrible signature. 
And there were only five other names on the page. 
Get rid of it. 
"Get rid of it"? 
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated? 
"Caroline Channing." 
Here, Max. 
Oh, look. 
The flowers and everything are so beautiful. 
There you go. 
You signed "Phil E. Cheese Steak"? 
You told me not to mention it anymore, so it's just a reminder. 
Okay, Max, there are gonna be a lot of people who will want my attention, so please be patient and stand next to me for the occasional supportive lean. 
And if someone starts to get too weepy, push them out of the way because I can't get tears on this dress. 
It has to be back to Barneys by 9:00 A.M. 
 You're here. 
 Here we go, Max. 
I was talking to him. 
Of course you were. 
It's a very sad day for us all. 
That was rough. 
Oh. Max, look. 
This is Antonia. 
 Wow. She looks really nice. 
 She was. 
I didn't know she was in the military. 
But it does explain those fabulous bed sheet corners. 
Wait, you didn't know your nanny was a marine? 
That's too bad, 'cause I'd be all, "Yo, other little rich kid! 
My nanny can snap your neck." 
Oh, look. There are 
her sisters, Cecelia and Angela, and there are her nieces and nephews. 
And there is not me anywhere. 
You know, my picture must be in the coffin with the other V.I.P.s. 
If you're a V.I.P., 
can we get some bottle service? 
Good afternoon, ladies. 
I'm Anthony, Antonia’s nephew. 
 It's sad day, huh? 
 Yes, it is. 
 Think I just got a little less sad. 
 Oh! Anthony! 
Stop. We're family. 
I'm Caroline Channing. 
You're Caroline "Hot," is all I know. 
You ladies need cash envelopes or you guys cool? 
I always need a cash envelope. 
I'm sorry, envelopes for what? 
Well, at Italian wakes, the mourners give the family a donation after they view the deceased. 
So it's pay-per-view? 
That was a good one. 
Hey, you want to go get a pop later? 
We're leaving right after, but yes, Anthony. 
 Thank you. We'll take an envelope. 
 All right. 
The body's right through there. 
 Go right ahead. 
 Anthony, stop. 
I'm really nervous. I've never 
seen a dead body before. 
I've seen a bunch. A couple 
of them were my fault. 
I don't have any cash. 
Do you have any money? 
Let me check my wallet. 
This is a real Ziploc, not one of those knock-offs. 
Make sure you seal the envelope, so people think it's all quarters. 
Max, we're next. I'm afraid. 
Hold my hand. 
Hold hands? What are we? 
On a Christian mingle fifth date? 
Please, Max. 
I'm nervous. 
 Oh, God. 
 Thank you. 
Okay. Now give it back. 
What? That was just 
my longest relationship. 
Plus, I need it to put this change in the envelope. 
Oh, she looks so peaceful. 
Hi, Antonia. 
It's me, Caroline. 
Should I kiss her? The family 
is right there watching. 
The lady before us kissed her. 
Go for it. Doesn't look 
like she'd fight you. 
Okay, on the count of three. 
One, two... 
No! Max, hold my hand again 
while I... 
What do we do? 
Wait, leave it! We were 
giving it to them anyway. 
Not all of it. 
That's our cheese steak money. 
Leave it. Come on. 
I am so, so sorry about that. 
My nerves got the best of me. 
You understand. 
 I'm Cecelia, Antonia’s... 
 Sister. I know. 
I see the resemblance. 
I'm Caroline. 
Caroline who? 
Oh. Caroline Channing. 
Caroline Channing who? 
You're having a hard time processing. Understandable. 
It's been a very emotional day for us all. 
Who is this girl? You, I feel 
like I've seen somewhere. 
Are you Ricky's girl from Rochester? 
I could be. 
What's in it for me? 
Antonia used to take care of me when I was little. 
Oh, Antonia was your baby-sitter. 
Very nice of you to come. 
Well, she was hardly my "baby-sitter." 
She took care of me every day for ten years. 
Caroline. 
Caroline Channing. 
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are, sweetheart, though it seems to be what you're hammering me about. 
If you'll excuse me, I need a cigarette. 
And then I got to remove some of those pennies off of my sister. 
It's a coffin, not a wishing well. 
This funeral turned out to be very depressing. 
Well, yeah. 
Dead body in the room, generally a buzz-kill. 
Unless it's an Irish wake... Then 
you're playing beer pong off the coffin. 
No, I mean, how is it possible that the family doesn't know me? 
Did Antonia never even mention me? 
Let's focus on the positive. 
Anthony really liked your ass. 
I know what Antonia and I had. 
This is what we had. 
Peep, peep. 
That's what we had. 
Well, that's a lot. 
But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that, and it's a shame too, because I had a great eulogy. 
You do? 
Yes. I do. Would you like 
me to share it with you? 
I most certainly would. 
You are not seriously eulogy-bombing that old lady, are you? 
She asked me about my great eulogy. 
She's a hundred. She probably thought 
you said you had a great urologist. 
Do you have a pen? I'm getting 
the name of her doctor. 
No, ma'am, I didn't say, "urologist." 
I said, "eulogy." A great eulogy. 
Why would you give the eulogy? 
Because I'm Caroline Channing. 
 Who? 
 Caroline Channing. 
Caroline Channing...? 
Antonia was my nanny. 
My family was rich, but then my father robbed everyone, and we became the scourge of society, overshadowed a little bit by Mel Gibson hating the Jews that same week. 
Surely, you remember? 
Honey, I don't even remember how I got here. 
I can't believe this. 
I constructed my entire "happy" childhood on the fact that even though my mom left and apparently didn't love me, Antonia did. 
And now I get here and I realize no one loved me, I was just a paycheck. 
One of the many kids she baby-sat. 
I don't even know why I bothered to come. 
I'm gonna go to the restroom and then we can just leave. 
Excuse me. Hi. 
Max, Ricky's girl. 
I know this is a hard time for you, but it's a hard time for my friend as well. 
And even though you never heard of her, I was wondering if you could just go over there, and say you just remembered her, and that Antonia talked about her all the time? 
I know it's a 180 on your original story and a lie, and I'd offer to pay you for your trouble, but my 401k is laying in that box on top of your sister. 
Look, I only permitted you two to stay 'cause your Ricky was so nice to Uncle Joe when he fell off the roof last year. 
But now, you gotta go. 
Okay. 
Be that way. 
But don't expect Ricky to pick up Uncle Joe for dialysis. 
Max, what are you doing? 
The family asked me to put it up. 
They just remembered you. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm so pathetic, you have to put up my picture to make me feel better? 
In a way, yes. 
It belongs up there. 
Who wouldn't want to know that kid? 
Nice to meet you, Antonia. 
Please don't haunt us. 
Now, let's hit the road and get some freaking cheese steaks! 
Max, please take that down. 
It's so embarrassing. 
Nobody here knows anything about me. 
They didn't know me either, chicken. 
Hey, who you callin' chicken? 
Me. That was 
Antonia’s nickname for me. 
 You know who I am? 
 Of course I do. 
Antonia's little chick, her peep. 
She loved you. 
And she loved making you that costume. 
Took the whole kitchen table up with all those sequins, but she knew you deserved to sparkle. 
She loved you so much, I couldn't begin to complain. 
I'm so sorry. 
What was your name? 
I'm Meg O'Hara. 
I was her roommate. 
And lover. 
We were together 30 years. 
The military! 
I know, right? 
I mean, come on. 
That's me with my arm around her on that tank. 
And the family still had no clue. 
Vintage lez... 
Very cool. 
I know Toni would have wanted you to have these. 
Oh, thanks for coming, chicken. 
You're probably the only person in the world who loved her as purely as I did. 
Max, look. 
Christmas. 
And my birthday. 
And the Teen Choice Awards. 
I'm sorry for your loss. 
Thank you. 
Philly cheese steaks for everybody! 
And you really haven't lived until you've driven two hours in a Chevy with nine cheese steaks and a gassy animal. 
What? I ate mine 
in the car. 
Hey, Earl, you missed one hell of a funeral. You should have come. 
There were some hot octogenarians, and I got a definite "jungle fever" vibe from one of them. 
Girl, at my age, you don't go anywhere near funerals. 
You accidentally doze off, you spend six hours digging yourself out of the ground. 
Hey, how you holding up, chicken? 
I'm okay. Thanks. 
And Max, when I die, I don't care who else is at my funeral, as long as you're there. 
Of course I'll be there. The murderer 
always shows up to throw off the cops. 
Also, save the money on a casket and just toss me in a hole wearing Dior and a smoky eye. 
Unless I'm fat... 
Then burn me. 
Well, I don't want a funeral. 
When I die, just shove my corpse into a Cannon and blow me directly into the Trump Casino. 
﻿1 Oh, hey. 
You ready? 
I can't. I just can't. 
Everyone feels like that the first few times you eat here. 
It's like heroin. 
It makes you sick, and you think, "I'll never do that again," and here we are. 
No, we put our project on Kickstarter, and we're getting major funding right now. 
And I can't. I just can't. 
Kickstarter... 
that's the website where strangers give money for crap that no one in the real world would invest in, right? 
Exactly, but our project isn't crap. 
It's bananas. 
We design candles with arms. 
I can't. I just can't. 
Don't you have a passion project... 
something you've always wanted to do? 
Yeah, you can't just want to be a waitress your whole life. 
Actually... I do 
have a Kickstarter idea. 
I'd like to start kicking your asses! 
You know we work for tips, right? 
Yeah. This one 
got away from me. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  okay, listen up, it's Tuesday, and like Martin Luther King, I have a dream. 
Tonight you will do side work. 
Hold up, girl. I have ten 
minutes till my shift starts. 
Max, that is not appropriate. 
I'm your boss. 
Don't call me "girl." 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay, you want to play? 
I'll play. 
Hey, sir. Hey, big Manny man. 
Why don't you show me your penis? 
Han, you know I don't have a penis. 
It's the only thing we have in common. 
Where's Caroline? 
In the back at our cupcake shop. 
Why you don't open your walk-up window till you close here at night? 
She's getting a jump on our side work. 
What? We can't do 
ours and yours. 
Relax, Marjorie. 
Keep it up, Max, and one day I will show you my penis. 
And you'll be sorry. 
Yes. Yes, I will. 
That's it! New rule! 
No more making fun of the boss! 
Han doesn't want us calling him names anymore. 
It's like, if you don't want to be called names, don't look like that. 
 When a fire starts to burn, right...  
Why is the window open? 
What is all that? 
It's me, if I had lived. 
 When a fire starts to burn, right...  
Oh, my God. 
Did you see that rack? 
See it? I have to carry it 
around all day. 
I've been wearing the same clothes every day for two years. 
Now, I know that's your dream scenario, but to me, it's a horror show. 
Go get new clothes. 
Just go to the place around the corner and buy some cheap ones. 
Max, they sell clothes by the pound. 
That's why it's called the fashion pound, and that is why it is awesome. 
Look, I'm willing to cut a lot of other things, including my wrists, but I need quality clothes. 
The only reason I've been able to wear these pants every day is because they're quality. 
Well, that and a lot of febreze, which reminds me... 
I used to smell like money. 
Now I smell like pennies. 
And, Max, you need a hit. 
'Breze me. 
Hi, girls. 
Did you see the high-fashion model shoot? 
I was too short to be a model in Poland. 
Well, I guess you can't have it all, right? 
Do I smell febreze? 
That's my second-favorite scent. 
Oh, and there's my first-favorite scent. 
Hey, Sophie. 
I'm sorry. Have we met? 
I'm not good with faces that I never want to see again. 
What happened? 
I thought you guys were gonna be friends. 
Yeah, messed-up, passive-aggressive friends who occasionally sleep together, like Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell. 
Oh, okay, I see what you're doing. 
You're pretending like we don't have movie-character names for our private parts. 
Well, good-bye, miss, and give my regards to Mrs. Doubtfire. 
Okay, E.T., go home! 
Here's your mail, girls. 
Max, Sophie had a new purse. 
Everybody has something new. 
Even the homeless lady on the bus had a new barrette, and even though her feet were split open, I still felt jealous. 
Oh, this is not a bill. 
Now, that's a first. 
"We are offering you a new phone, "as older flip-model phones such as yours have been degraded." 
They're slut-shaming phones now? 
I don't want a new anything. 
And I like my old flip. 
Where's my damn letter from the pants company, saying, "girl, those things are tired..." 
here's a new pair for free"? 
If you want something for free, why don't you just go on Kickstarter like everyone else? 
You can't use it for clothes. 
Can you? 
And if you can, can I? 
Why not? It's no stupider 
than candle arms. 
Now, if the candles had real arms and could slap the idiots who bought them, I'd invest in that. 
Max, we have nothing, and if anybody is giving us something for free, we're taking it. 
You are getting that free phone, and I am begging for free clothes. 
Things are looking up. 
You might want to Kickstart some underwear. 
Well, obviously, they don't have anything. 
Let's go. 
Max, stop. My pants 
just ripped some more. 
I have to fix them again. 
Hey, quality, why don't you just take them to Office Depot and get them tailored? 
Let's shop. 
Ow. 
Uh-oh, they're ripping again. 
I feel a breeze up in my febreze. 
How can I help you? 
Oh, hey. Hi, uh, Cchiandra. 
Where can I get a new flip phone? 
Mm, let me think. 
Guatemala. 
I'll miss you, phone. 
This is breaking my heart. 
Come on, boo. 
It's a phone, not Bruno Mars. 
Now, I need that letter. 
Oh, here it is. I have it. 
It's in my purse. 
What's her story? 
Why is her hand on her ass? 
Her staples popped. 
Lap band? 
Happened to my cousin. 
She had a diet 7 up and exploded. 
Then she got M.S. 
According to judge Joe brown, it was not related. 
Uh, here, I'll just take this one. 
Slow down, now. 
Take a look around. 
You got a whole world of possibilities. 
Pick 'em up, get a feel, hold it in your hand for a while. 
Chiandra, it's a phone, not Bruno Mars. 
Oh, "Texting is easy" with the new finger friendly keyboard." 
My fingers are already too friendly. 
Ask my fourth-grade boyfriend. 
Wow. These sample texts 
are getting kind of racy. 
"Bad news... I think 
the condom broke last night." 
Why would anyone put that on a display model? 
That's mine. 
I left it there by accident. 
But that's not your problem. 
Now, tell me, what are your phone needs? 
Uh, my needs are simple. 
I need a phone that can draw a mustache on people and occasionally will call my mother and hang up. 
And she needs one with a good camera, because I have to film my video pitch for new pants. 
I have a hole in my butt. 
You know you're supposed to, right? 
Max, I might be a virgin again. 
I love my new phone! 
It's so cool and red. 
It feels like anything could happen! 
But it probably won't. 
My first call. 
What do I do? 
What do I do? 
Oh. Hello? 
Oh, hey, girl, good for you. Bye. 
Chiandra's not pregnant. 
Max, why are you taking calls from Cchiandra? 
We have to do my video. 
I had to take her call. 
She gave me a bunch of free apps... 
Angry Birds, Doodle Jump. 
If you want to look like a dog, I could do that. 
Look, here's me as a St. Bernard. 
See my neck keg? 
Okay, I've done some research, and here's some things other people want money for. 
One woman wants money for a new leg. 
Scrolling. 
Wait. If she only has one leg, 
shouldn't she be on can't-Kickstarter? 
Oh, I'm no longer working with them. 
They denied my project. 
Apparently, I'm not artsy enough and have too many legs. 
So now I'm on go fund yourself. 
Oh, perfect. 
I've been telling you to go fund yourself for years. 
The future of my pants hinges on the video pitch. 
The tone needs to be sad and pathetic. 
Uh, preparation done. 
What's sadder than former billionaire Caroline Channing asking for money for pants? 
Oh, they're not gonna know it's me. 
Are you being funded by Al-Qaeda? 
If they're buying, I'm taking. 
And action. 
Hi. I can't tell you my name, 
and I can't show you my face because I'm too ashamed. 
Sadly, I find myself in a situation where I am no longer able to provide myself with the garments I need in order to be the best in my day-to-day life. 
I'm aware that this is not a problem for everybody. 
Stop, stop! I need to take 
a picture of myself having the most fun I've ever had. 
Your nose is coming out of your eyehole. 
No. 
No, no, no, Max, don't stop. 
I'm in a groove. 
No, you're in a bag. 
Please let me take a picture of you in a bag and then turn it into a dog and then call it a doggie bag. 
Go, Max, I'm running out of oxygen, and I think there was cheese in here. 
And action. 
If I achieve my goal... 
specifically, a new pair of quality pants... 
then I promise I will give back to the community, wearing said pants. 
All I need is $1,500. 
Stop! Whoa! $1,500? 
How many pounds of clothes are you getting? 
Look, it's for one pair of amazing dries van Noten silk brocade pants... super cute. 
And, yes, it's a lot, but my investors will get something in return. 
For $5, they will get the feeling of goodwill in their heart. 
Pbbt! 
For $10, I'll send them a selfie in the new pants that they bought. 
For $20, I'll send them a selfie without pants. 
Nobody is gonna give you money for the stuff you offered. 
"Goodwill in their hearts"? 
This is the Internet. 
We're animals. 
You're right. 
I have an idea. 
Camera up. 
And action. 
I'm sure a lot of you are probably thinking, "look at this spoiled, indulgent, clueless girl." 
Well, I am. 
And you're also probably thinking, "God, I want to slap her." 
Well, guess what. You can! 
For $500, you can come here and slap my spoiled, clueless face. 
And cut. 
Pretty good, huh? 
Genius. Now, here, 
take the camera. 
I want to film my video to raise $500 to slap you. 
Earl, look! 
I just got 20 more dollars from one of my backers! 
Now, let me get this straight. 
You just ask people for money, and they give it to you... 
without using a weapon? 
Well, Earl, I guess desperation cuts like a knife. 
Man, being white is easy. 
Um, we're ready to order. 
Caroline, I just unlocked the candy hammer. 
Can you go over there and take those girls' orders? 
I can't. I just can't. 
Oh, no way! I just hit $1,000! 
That's almost both legs paid for! 
Uh, hello? 
You're dinging and donging right in front of my face. 
Can't you at least put your phones on vibrate? 
I don't like to mix business with pleasure. 
You two need to be off your phones and working. 
Now. And no back talk. 
Totally. 
Totally. 
 Totally. 
 Totally. 
Oh, I know what's going on. 
You're group-texting insults about me! 
We are not. 
I got your text! 
Han does look like those Minion things in despicable me! 
Oh. 
And I thought bullying would end when I hit four feet. 
Oh! Oh, my God! 
I'm getting my new pants! 
I just got a $500 pledge! 
Somebody wants to slap me! 
Somebody wants to slap me! 
Just one person? 
Hey, han insists we can't leave tonight without doing our side work, so I made him into a chihuahua wearing a diaper. 
Check your phone. 
Caroline? 
Someone got some new pants! 
 When a fire starts to burn, right   And it starts to spread   She gonna bring that attitude home   They don't want to do nothing with they life   When a fire starts to burn, right  I wasn't finished! 
No, I was. 
Max, I didn't want to tell you this, but I was secretly worried my Booty was gone. 
Turns out, it was just the pants. 
It's still there. 
Take a picture of it. 
Okay, let me see. 
Perfect! 
Now, let's send a group-text to our diner family, and I'd like you to copy me on that, because I want to send it to my dad in prison. 
He'll be so proud. 
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure he's not seeing any asses there. 
You know what I love about these pants? 
How they make my butt look... 
can you see it through the window? 
I got new pants. 
Hey, Earl, you got my text, right? 
You mean that picture of Caroline in her pants that said, "I'm so sick of her"? 
I know, right? 
If she ever gets a new shirt, just kill me. 
I hear you, Max, but I just can't believe you included her on the text. 
Yeah. 
What? 
Oh, my God. 
I didn't take her off the chain. 
I mean, if you're gonna trash a child, you got to take her off the chain. 
Look, Earl, they're here! 
Look what your $10 is buying you! 
Uh-uh, not looking. 
Don't want to know. 
I'm taking myself off the chain. 
Uh, hey, Caroline. 
Uh, did you get my text? 
Not yet. 
The front of the diner is a bad reception area. 
Uh, no, no, no, no. 
Don't reach for that. 
It's probably just an Amber alert. 
Why are you acting weird? 
Oh, are you jealous of my new pants? 
No, but I may have texted something about you that I didn't mean, so just please don't look at your phone. 
Uh, okay. 
If it's something bad, I don't want to see it anyway. 
She's gonna look at it, isn't she, Earl? 
I would. 
She just did. 
You're so sick of me? 
'Cause it's funny! 
"I'm so sick of you!" 
You know, said funny. 
You know how I am. 
Ask Earl. Earl, help. 
Oh, I am off the chain. 
Oleg, help. 
I'll be in my car. 
Oh, look, look! Here's han! 
He knows how I'm always just joking. 
Han, nod your head and don't ask why. 
Oh, no, last time you asked me to do that, I wound up on a date with an albino. 
And who didn't call who back? 
I don't know how they're so confident. 
Max, you said you were sick of me. 
Oh, why are you so upset? 
I say worse things to you all the time. 
Yesterday I said you were sad and pathetic. 
But that was to my face. 
I can't believe you talk about me behind my back. 
It's bad. I am sorry. 
What can I do? 
Hit me. Punch me. 
Tell my mother where I live. 
Congratulations, Max. 
Now you're like all my old girlfriends, talking behind my back. 
Stop looking at that. 
Delete it. 
This is not what I think. I'm 
not sick of you. Really? 
'Cause when I see it in writing, it feels like you are. 
It's not me. It's this phone. 
It brought out the ugliness that was kind of already there. 
There! 
I killed it because it hurt you. 
I swear I didn't mean it. 
You have to believe me. 
It's fine, Max. 
I feel like I'm gonna throw up. 
There... 
I French-fried my phone. 
What else can I do? 
I mean, really, it is technology's fault. 
It's turning us against each other. 
Caroline, I swear, I will never accidentally say anything about you again that I never meant. 
I have to get ready for work. 
It's fine. 
Stop saying that. 
Please stop saying it's fine. 
"Fine" doesn't mean fine. 
The scale goes great, good, okay, not okay, I hate you, fine. 
If "fine" meant fine, that'd be great, but it doesn't, okay? 
You're right. It's not fine. 
It sucks. I'm hurt. 
You're the one person I care most about. 
No, you are the one person I care the most about. 
Well, right now it doesn't feel that way. 
It has to feel that way! 
You are my best friend, Caroline! 
I love you. 
Oh, my God, now I'm really gonna throw up. 
Max, is that the first time you said "I love you"? 
Don't look at me. 
I'm embarrassed. 
Now what do we do? 
So you're not sick of me? 
You are the only person in the entire world I am not sick of. 
Caroline... 
There's a woman here who said she paid to slap you. 
If I had known it was an option, I would have thrown my name into that hat. 
Well, time to put this on. 
That's my $500 pledge. 
I'll go. What? 
I'll take it. I deserve it. 
You've already gotten a slap in the face from me. 
But she's expecting to see me. 
No, she's expecting to see a clueless woman wearing a paper bag. 
And even though I wasn't planning on becoming that woman for another 20, 25 years, I owe you. 
Seriously? 
You're not gonna stop me? 
Nope. 
And, Max... I love you too. 
I'm so sick of you. 
﻿1 Thank you. 
That was, like, our tenth gay guy tonight. 
Let's hope our gay buzz lasts longer than Adam Lambert’s. 
Oh, it will. 
I'm all over it. 
And by "it," I mean I'm all over grindr. 
Max, why are you on that app? 
You're not a gay man looking for anonymous sex. 
Don't put me in a box! 
You told me to find ways to drum up business. 
Well, I'm drumming it up by showing off this guy's "bid'ness." 
I pretended to be a rough and ready Puerto Rican guy who still likes to cuddle. 
That there's gay chum, my friend. 
Ooh, I hooked a big one. 
Get the net. 
Hi. Was a muscular 
Puerto Rican guy just here? 
When is there not? 
Would you like to purchase a delicious cupcake while you wait? 
Well, maybe, while I wait. 
My phone says he's right here. 
Here, this is on the house, because the muscular gay guy, that's him. 
It's cool that you're transitioning, but you really should let people know you're not Puerto Rican. 
Well.... He said he was 22 
and butch, so I'm mad too. 
Season 3, Episode 8 "And the 'It' Hole" Earl, I need my checks for tonight. 
 Beautiful? 
 Check. 
 Sexy? 
 Check. 
 Cool? 
 Check. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I was ten minutes early for my shift, so I thought "well, I have 20 minutes to kill," and I wandered into this cool surf shop and saw this guy polishing a surfboard. 
A surfer here? 
You don't hang ten in Williamsburg, you hang yourself. 
I'm with Max, the only waves we get in Brooklyn are heat waves and crime waves. 
 Earl, you never go out to the beach? 
 You crazy? 
I'm ain't gonna get eaten by some shark. 
Ain't nobody got time for that. 
The chances of you being bit by a shark are, like, .0001%. 
Not if you're black. 
Sharks are racist as hell. 
That's why they call them "great whites." 
Marc, the surfer, and I really hit it off, and he is so cute, like a young Matthew McConaughey, but with real hair. 
So nothing like Matthew McConaughey. 
I hope he texts me. 
I love surfing. 
I never go in the water, 'cause I know if I start drowning, I'm not gonna fight it. 
When I used to summer in St. Barths, 
there'd be these sexy Italian surfers, and they'd invite us to sunbathe on their boards. 
I mean, they robbed us, but it was amazing. 
Caroline, if you're looking for that kind of guy, I have a cousin who loves the water. 
It's the only place he can move his legs. 
 Oh, sweet. No thanks. 
 Well, think about it. 
You'll be at the front row of every concert, and he doesn't move around a lot when he sleeps. 
Here, give old Ironside my number. 
What? I love music, 
and if he bugs me, the city has one of those free vans that'll take him home. 
It's the surfer asking me out to dinner! 
And he thinks he can get us into the hot, new spot, Harlow and Daughters. 
Oh, that's that trendy restaurant that replaced a perfectly good hot dog on a stick. 
Good night, broke-ass divas. 
Good night, Brokeback waiter. 
I'm gonna go get a massage, and then, who knows? 
Maybe give one. 
Oh, who am I kidding? 
I'm coming back here pregnant. 
 Luis, can you work for me tomorrow? 
 Absolutely not, no. 
Oleg's working, and I'll ask him to wear his fishnet tank top. 
Then yes. 
Dinner with a cute guy who has connections to the "A"-list place? 
I'm living my old life. 
Hey, everybody. 
Did your old life have one of these? 
Caroline, what is my number-one diner rule? 
Don't tell anyone the meat isn't real? 
Shh. Come on. 
If you can see it, it's real. 
Don't tell anyone you buy the shrimp out of your friend's trunk? 
He lays down a blanket! 
No. 
No phones. 
Max, he got us the reservation! 
I'm going to dinner at the new "it" place. 
Ooh, the "it" place! 
"Let's have dinner at the 'it' place." 
How come this isn't the "it" place? 
This isn't an "it" place. 
It's more of an "it" hole. 
Okay, so how do we become an "it" place? 
First, burn the place down, start fresh. 
Then you create hype by making it impossible to get a reservation. 
You basically refuse to let anyone in. 
Can I be the first? 
Okay, I've put my date purse together. 
I've got my gum, my gloss, and a $20 bill to make it seem like I have money, which I will return to the register at the diner tomorrow. 
Well, you're welcome to use my date purse. 
It's a Ziploc with a cigar and a change of boxers. 
And my phone is fully charged, so I can call an uber car to take me home. 
An uber car? 
You can't afford a fancy town car. 
Yesterday, you used an English muffin to exfoliate. 
Yeah, and then I ate it. 
Plus, it's on our joint credit card, which means every time you make a dumb purchase, you owe me a joint. 
I don't want to have him take me home and give him the wrong idea. 
Oh, please do give him the wrong idea. 
Stay out all night with the surfer. 
Ride his half-pipe. 
That's not surfboard, that's snowboard. 
Perfect, 'cause I'm snow-bored with this conversation. 
What do you think? 
These things on full display? 
I hate to be that roommate, but I didn't say you could borrow my breasts. 
What? It's just a push-up bra, chicken 
cutlets, a little tissue, and some tape. 
You know, natural. 
Just go on your date already! 
Nancy and I have been really looking forward to you leaving so we can walk around naked and do some lines of cat nip. 
Ooh, that must be him. 
Don't worry, he's not coming inside. 
He better not, cause we can't afford a baby. 
 Oh, it's just Sophie. 
 "Just Sophie"? 
That was the name of my talk show in Poland. 
Oh, how I wish I could have been a guest on that show. 
No, there were no guests. 
It was just Sophie! 
Oh, you getting ready for your big date, Caroline? 
How did you hear about my date? 
Oh, well, your voice travels. 
Yeah, I hear everything that does and doesn't happen down here and down there, so... 
So let's just say I'm very glad that you're going on a date. 
Oh, and I got you a little present. 
Cinnamon mints, for your first kiss. 
Oh, that's so sweet, Sophie. 
Yeah, and I got you a big grab bag of condoms. 
I got all sizes. 
I got magnums, I got super magnums, I got regular, and... 
"He's got a great personality." 
Here you go. 
Usually, a "great personality" is the only birth control I need. 
Thank you, but I am a lady, and I won't be needing these until our third date. 
Well, you better hurry up and get dressed. 
Sophie, I'm already dressed. 
You are? 
And I like what I'm wearing. 
You do? 
Well, just put on a little makeup. 
I'm fully made up. 
You are? 
Oh, well, you know, maybe when you do your hair. 
Okay, I'm a little behind on my hair. 
My boobs were a bigger project than I thought. 
And I like what I'm wearing, and I don't have time to change 'cause he's already 20 minutes late. 
20 minutes late? 
Wahh-wahh. 
That's a no-show. 
You've just got stood up. 
You got stood up somethin' awful. 
I did not get stood up. 
I've never been stood up. 
In fact, I wouldn't even know if I was being stood up, because that's how little I know about being stood up. 
Am I being stood up? 
No, you are not. 
Guys are always late. 
I once waited three days for a guy. 
But he showed up with the ransom money, and you don't see me living in a fridge anymore. 
Okay, fine. 
Nobody got stood up. 
So I'll just sit here and text while we wait... 
You know, forever. 
And then, finally, when it dawns on you, we can call our friend Oleg, and he can go put a hit on him. 
You know what, maybe he thought we were meeting there. 
I'm calling the restaurant to see... 
Yes, hi, has a Marc Faison checked in yet? 
He has not. 
What about now? 
It's just that he was supposed... 
Well, I'm busy too. 
Don't be so snooty, you used to be a hot dog on a stick. 
Just a heads up, if he doesn't show, I'm still getting naked. 
Ooh, there he is! 
No, it's from Amazon. 
Someone's sending me a copy of He's Just Not That Into You. 
Yeah, I'm here for you, girl. 
Well, I got stood up. 
Remember where you are, Max. 
This was the day Caroline Channing got stood up. 
Well, screw him for standing you up. 
And from now on, never trust a guy who surfs anything besides porn. 
Oh, look, Harlow and Daughters has a real old-timey, general store kind of vibe. 
I guess they take "Throwback Thursday" really seriously here. 
I mean, it's 1840. 
Yeah, I wanted to take you back to a time before you were stood up. 
Thank you for making me take the reservation, Max. 
I mean, otherwise, I was just gonna get in bed and be depressed. 
You were in bed and you were depressed. 
Don't rewrite history just 'cause these folks have. 
I mean, we are smack in the belly of Williamsburg ironic chic, and I want to smack it. 
Look, they even have a country clothesline hung with baby clothes. 
We should get this for Han. 
I mean, that is the most pretentious thing I've ever seen. 
Hi, welcome to Harlow and Daughters. 
I'm the host, Brian-Brian. 
No, that is. 
Yes, hi, um, Brian-Brian. 
We have a reservation. 
Faison, party of two. 
Is your whole party here? 
Well, I don't know how whole I could ever hope to be, as I'm illegitimate. 
Yes, we're both here. 
Thank you. 
So both you and Mr. Faison 
are here? 
Yes, I'm transitioning. 
Ask around. 
You can have a drink, and I'll call you when your table is ready. 
Thank you, thank you, Brian-Brian. 
I'll be right over. 
Go use your new boobs to get us a seat at the bar. 
Hi, I know what "wait by the bar" means. 
I've been working in restaurants since your clothes were in style. 
 It means I'll seat you when your... 
 BrianBrian, BriBri, B.B., come on. 
You and I both know there's no guy coming. 
My friend got stood up, so please don't make things worse. 
Just take out your cool, little hunting knife and cut us some slack. 
This is where I'd tip you with cash or offer you sex, but I'm kinda broke and you're kinda gay, so just be nice. 
We don't really need to bring my sexuality into it. 
I understand, it's hard to be out 100 years ago. 
Oh, funny. 
Right this way, Mr. Faison. 
Wow, that was quick. 
They're so nice here. 
Yep, just regular folks, sitting around designer pickle barrels. 
All right, here's your table. 
Have a seat. 
Sure, where? On these Amish birthing 
stools we're all calling chairs? 
Stick to the gay jokes. 
Our Wi-Fi password is on the ox hide. 
Your waitress will be right over. 
Max, a waitress will be right over, and it won't be us. 
Look, dirty sawdust floors. 
If we got a bag of wood chips, our apartment could be the new "it" place. 
Hello, my name is York. 
Hard to believe, but a man named Brian-Brian has been dethroned. 
York? That's fun. 
"York" as in "New"? 
York as in York. 
Just York. 
So what's this bit? 
Okay. Well, um, York, we'd like 
to start with some drinks. 
Having a girls' night out. 
All the single ladies put ya hands up! 
Yeah, you can't force it. 
Our special libation this evening is "The Small Pox." 
It's absinthe, cloves, orange bitters hand-muddled in a mason jar. 
Was that drink directed by Wes Anderson? 
Can we just get two of your "ye olde" cheapest beers as soon as possible? 
Because Dr. Quinn, 
I need some medicine, woman. 
York, does the special soup have any garlic? 
 Oh, my God, no way! 
 What? Is someone making soap? 
No. 
No garlic? 
You still think the surfer's coming. 
Well, he might. 
See, I was supposed to have a date with this guy... 
You don't care. 
So, the soup? 
Actually, I'm just taking drink orders right now. 
Wow, who loved you? 
Eh, I'm guessing she never went to a father/daughter dance with her mom's weed dealer. 
You don't know, Max. 
Maybe he lost his phone and he didn't have my number, so he's on his way running here. 
You think he's just gonna rush in soaking wet and be like, "Oh, I'm so sorry. 
The traffic was terrible. 
The waves were bumper-to-bumper." 
This is not a Katherine Heigl movie. 
Sorry, "movie." 
Fine, he's not coming. 
And I'm not getting into the Katie Heigl thing. 
Not here, not now. 
Let's just enjoy our acorns. 
Ooh, "blocked number." 
Maybe it's him. Hello? 
Hang up. 
He's not coming. 
Our drinks are right there. 
I can see them over yonder, on ye olde bar. 
It's been an hour, where is our waitress, Lizzie Borden? 
Probably in the back deciding which words to pronounce weirdly. 
I'm starving. 
Bust out those chicken cutlets. 
No wonder they don't have any bad yelp reviews. 
No one's ever tasted their food. 
Hi. 
Um, our drinks? 
And did you ask the chef about the soup? 
You know, I haven't had a minute. 
She hasn't had a minute? 
What's she been doing, dancing with wolves? 
I mean, have you ever? 
I know, can you even? 
Byron and I have been here forever, and have yet to see our dandelion chickpea foie-gras. 
He's hypoglycemic and I'm Lila. 
And I'm pissed. 
I'm getting our drinks. 
 Would you get us some wine? 
 Oh, sure, what kind? 
A chardonnay for me, and Byron will have a sauvignon blanc. 
 Max, no, they'll kick us out and... 
 And what? What, Caroline? 
You won't be here when "he arrives?" 
Dear Lord, the man is not coming! 
I know that, Max, and he's not coming because he died. 
He died, that's the only reason I can accept. 
What's up? 
How we all doin' tonight? 
Not so good. My girlfriend 
just broke up with me. 
Oh, yeah? 
You like blondes? 
'Cause I got one who's ready to pop. 
No, man, I'm into Asian chicks. 
Yeah, who isn't? 
Except for Asian guys. 
Hey, do me a favor, just wait a minute, and then come over to my table and flirt with my friend. 
Why would I do that? 
On the house. 
Is that the "dandelion chickpea and other things that don't belong in a dish together" thing? 
All right, your dandelion chickpea, a chardonnay, and a sauvignon blanc. Enjoy. 
What do you think you're doing? 
Waiting on tables. 
Look into it. 
York, York, don't be mad. 
Byron was starving and we're thirsty. 
Don't kick us out, we're too weak to go anywhere else. 
The soup has garlic. 
Oh, then no. 
The salmon, please. 
Bring her the damn soup, she ain't kissing nobody tonight. 
And I'll have the free-range chicken that thought it had a chance. 
For your help. 
Byron wants you to have it. 
Well, Byron is the only real old-fashioned thing in here. 
I hope you both survive the winter. 
Hey, can I join you? 
Ooh, I think that "can I join you?" was to you. 
Oh, sure, have a seat. 
You're pretty. 
You have a good body. 
Wow, thank you. 
That's actually kind of nice to hear, because this is hard to believe, but I got stood up tonight, and it kind of makes me feel good when you say I'm pretty and I have a good body. 
What are you doing? 
Oh, I'm on tinder. 
It's the straight grindr. 
I just got a hit. 
Well, I'm out. 
Thanks for the drink. 
You paid a guy to say I'm pretty? 
And then he blew me off? 
Oh, my God. I just realized 
something upsetting. 
What, that we could be enjoying delicious hot dogs on sticks right now? 
 No, I'm a "B." 
 No, you're an "A." 
That bra just makes you look like a "B." 
No, I mean me, as a woman. 
I'm a "B." 
You know, all this time, I kinda thought I was an "A," but maybe I'm just a "B." 
That's why he walked away and why the surfer stood me up. 
Caroline, I really want to be here for you right now, but I gotta get a gin fizz to the prospector in the corner. 
Max, am I a "B"? 
Why didn't he come? 
All I know about that surfer is that he is a "D" followed by three other letters. 
I'd spell it out for you, but I'm literally afraid I'd get it wrong. 
Interesting that you didn't say I wasn't a "B." 
Look, I don't give myself letters in life. 
To me, it is clearly a pass/fail situation. 
And you're sitting up, not drooling on yourself, so pass. 
Well, well, well, where have you ladies been all night? 
I don't know, I'd say somewhere between 1846 and 1860. 
And it is so great to be back in 1974. 
Well, Han, you did a good job of making this place exclusive. 
There is literally nobody here. 
It wasn't my doing, there was a possum in the men's room. 
Correction, there is a possum in the men's room. 
Oh, the ingredients are escaping the kitchen again? 
Well, I gotta go to the men's room and pull out the possum. 
Oh, is that what you do when we're not here? 
All right, let's sit down in that authentically run-down old booth and eat something. 
Yeah, see, those stains aren't fake, that's real blood. 
I was right here when that guy got stabbed. 
Like I said at the time, "call me 'honey' one more time, and I will stab you." 
You know what I just realized? 
Even if I am a "B," at least I'm an authentic "B." 
I don't pretend to be something I'm not. 
You do kind of pretend to be something you're not. 
A "B." 
Finally, I have some customers. 
You know, I've been sitting in the back watching Oleg shuck his corn all night? 
Thank you. 
Now, Luis knows how to give service. 
Come on, chica, don't set me up like that, it's too easy. 
Max, I think I'm gonna let go of letter-grading myself and adopt your pass/fail system. 
And sitting with you right here is so not a fail. 
Oh, it's just Oleg and Sophie. 
Oh, my God! 
You looked 'cause you thought it was gonna be the surfer! 
Epic fail! 
Hey, what are you two doing together? 
Oh, Sophie and I had some business to take care of. 
Right, Sophie? 
Oh, yeah. 
Caroline, we got your back. 
That Mike won't be out there surfing again for quite a while. 
The surfer's name isn't Mike. 
It's Marc. 
No wonder he kept screaming, "My name is not Marc!" 
Well, I'll tell you one thing, we may have seen a lot of fake things tonight, but that's a for-real possum. 
Wow, Han's possum is bigger than I thought it would be. 
Hi! Today's special is clam chowder, 
and today's advice is: Don't eat it. 
Do you have Eggs Benedict Cumberbatch? 
You are really killing it tonight, Mary, and leaving no evidence. 
We're coming from Sherlock-con. 
It's like Comic-con, but for Sherlock Holmes fans. 
So it's way cooler. 
Excuse me for a sec. 
There's another waitress here who is gonna be a big fan of all of this. 
You're welcome for what I'm about to show you. 
Look, guess what they are. 
Time-traveling lesbians. 
We're not lesbians. 
I am. 
What is this? 
What just let out? 
A sale at the Burlington Coat Factory? 
They're Sherlock Holmes super-fans coming from a convention, which means there are a lot of cats home alone right now. 
Well, I'd say the only mystery is who here gets laid the least. 
Hello. 
Cracked it, Watson. 
One of those Sherlock ladies left her carpal tunnel brace in here. 
No address, but there's a card that says, "in case of emergency, dial 1-800-chocolate." 
And I'll take that. 
Okay, everybody. 
It's that time again. 
The diner's big spring clean! 
Oh, my God, has it been six years already? 
Too bad I just developed carpal tunnel. 
Max, do you think you can fake a stroke? 
Fake a stroke, fake an orgasm, basically anything that will get me out of work. 
Okay, we have lots of chores to do, and somebody will have to double up, because earl asked me not to speak to him for the rest of the night. 
Didn't I tell you to keep my name out your mouth? 
So, girls, what do you say we make it fun, huh? 
I'll read a chore. 
You raise your Haned. 
Scrape the fat puddle from under the stove! 
No takers? 
Next. 
Clear the spider community in the walk-in! 
No takers? 
Next. 
Clear the spider community in the dish room! 
No takers? 
Han, sorry, I can't clean. 
I have carpal tunnel. 
The doctor says I can't put any pressure on my wrist. 
And I can't clean either, Han. 
It's my jaw. 
I've got real bad "T.M.Z." 
Oh, you girls are so full of crap, like that third stall in the men's room. 
Any takers? 
She was so friendly in the job interview. 
Bonjour, Max. 
Oh, Chef Nicolas. 
Why am I seeing you outside of pastry school? 
Is it about my flan? 
Because no one likes that stuff anyway. 
Oh, no, that's not why I'm here. 
I want to speak to Caroline. 
But, yes, I gave your flan a "C"-minus. 
It was flat. 
Hmm. I'll go get her. Wow. 
First time a teacher's ever called me flat. 
Ow, ow, ow! 
Oh, my wrist! 
Oh, I thought you were Han. 
Please, I'm twice the man he is. 
Nicolas is here. 
What? No, no, no! 
He can't be in my personal life! 
I'm having a hard enough time avoiding working with him at pastry school. 
Did I just call the diner my personal life? 
I think so. I wasn't listening. 
So what do I tell him? 
Tell him he's married, and I don't go out with married men. 
Tell him what we had was a passing flirtation. 
Tell him now it's over, and he has to move on. 
Got it, you died in a grease fire. 
She's not here yet. 
Oh, well, will she be coming? 
Will she be coming? 
Nope, not anytime soon. 
Okay, I'll text her. 
Au revoir, Max. 
Sir, don't take this the wrong way, but you are one fine-looking man. 
Well, thank you very much. 
And back at you. 
Tell me something I don't know. 
Look at this. 
Nicolas already texted me. 
"Will you have dinner?" 
what should I do? 
Just ignore it, like I'm doing with that table That's flagging me down right now. 
I'm putting a stop to this Nicolas thing. 
"I'll have dinner with you when you leave your wife." 
And se-end. 
If you ever say "se-end" again, We're not gonna be "fri-ends." 
Hey, everybody! 
I just got back from Sundance. 
I saw ten Mark Ruffalo movies, and I got to watch Catherine Keener DJ. 
Whoever that is. 
I was in an indie movie once. 
Well, a guy filmed me eating a sloppy joe in the dressing room of a sport chalet. 
Sophie, how did you get into the Sundance Film Festival? 
Oh, I'm dating one of the bigwigs. 
He drives the Miramax party bus, and he wears a big wig. 
So I'm thinking about producing my own movie. 
You know, getting into the biz, babe. 
Sophie, if you need an actor, let me know. 
But I'll only do full frontal. 
I'll also do partial frontal or just penis close-ups. 
And if you need someone to play God, a judge, or an old guy sitting on a porch, I'm your man. 
Everyone, keep piping your cakes. 
Keep piping. 
Max, vite, vite. 
You need to pipe that more. 
That's funny, because my high school guidance counselor told me I need to pipe way less. 
Max, you are falling behind today. 
Where's your Deke? 
In my pants, where it always is. 
Oh, you mean Deke. 
He's got the flu. It's everywhere. 
No one can shake it. 
It's like Taylor Swift. 
Yeah, or Pitbull. 
Okay, everyone, that's time. 
I will see you all tomorrow. 
Au revoir, class. 
Au revoir, chef. 
Let's go. Let's go, 
let's go, let's go, let's go. 
Come on, come on, hurry. 
Let's get outta here. 
What's the hurry? 
You sound like my mother whenever the real people who lived in the house would come home. 
We need to leave now, while Nicolas is in his office. 
I don't want him to see me. 
I said everything I needed to say to him in my last text. 
Ooh, I smell scandal. 
So I've been hiding in the stairwell all day. 
Guess where those stairs go. 
A room where ten Vietnamese women are making next year's "Prada." 
And they do not like visitors. 
Oh, is that where you were? 
'Cause he asked me, so I told him you were pooping. 
Max, don't tell him I'm pooping! 
There's no shame in it, Caroline. 
Everyone poops. 
I don't. 
I just eat, digest, and then an angel comes and takes it away in the night. 
Excuse me, John. This is private. 
It's just between us girls. 
I know. 
That's why I'm standing here. 
Okay, I'm ready. Let me just grab 
the medicine I got for Deke. 
Aw, that's sweet. 
You got him antibiotics? 
No, I got him Vicodin. 
I want him to feel better. 
I just have to make it down the hall until the elevator without Nicolas catching me. 
Oh, like sexual Frogger. 
Game over. 
Your frog just got hit by a car. 
Caroline, there you are. 
I can't help feeling you're avoiding me or something. 
Avoiding you? No! 
I've been... 
pooping. 
For five hours? 
She had a reluctant stool. 
Oh, is that not helping? 
Caroline, I have something to tell you. 
Can we talk? 
We're all waiting. 
You know in your text how you said that you won't have dinner with me while I'm still married? 
Better clear some space on my DVR. 
There's a new scandal. 
Well, you can have dinner with me, because I'm leaving my wife. 
Uh, hello? 
What happened? 
Dude told you he was gonna leave his wife, And you left faster than Vladimir Putin at a gay bar. 
It's all a blur. I blacked out. 
I don't even know how I got here. 
I think I took the train, but, Max, I might have taken the bus. 
It came out of nowhere. 
I never expected him to leave his wife. 
It came out of your thumbs when you texted it to him. 
Look, when I texted him that, I was just being flirty. 
Flirty is me not wearing underwear To the times square M&M store. 
So you really don't want him to leave his wife? 
No! 
I mean, sure, maybe I fantasized about it, but in my fantasy we were on a ski trip, and I was jumping up and down, excited, With my best friend Jennifer Lawrence. 
Cool, maybe call Jen next time the possum traps you by the garbage cans. 
Look, I thought we were just having a fun distraction. 
You know, a couple kisses, a dry hump here and there. 
Oh, like the cheerleaders with the good grades. 
Exactly. I'm not the type of person 
who wants him to leave his wife. 
No, you're the type of person who almost wants him to leave his wife. 
Yes! Yes, that's me! 
I'm the "almost" girl. 
I almost lost my virginity 25 times. 
This was my conversation with my friends every Monday in high school: "Did you?" 
"Almost." 
Funny, 'cause I almost went to high school. 
Max, I have to figure out what to do about Nicolas before he almost makes a big mistake and leaves his wife. 
He's not leaving his wife for you. 
It's just a thing you say to pretty women to get them into bed. 
Like, "I'm a Russian prince," or, "That was a good story." 
With a tank top collection like yours, I'm surprised you have to say anything. 
I know, right? 
So you don't really think he's serious about leaving her? 
No. I've told dozens of women 
I'm leaving my wife for them, and I'm not even married. 
Here in America. 
That was nice of Oleg. 
Just when you think you've seen every part of a person, 'cause he's shown you on his phone, he surprises you. 
Oh, I feel so much better. 
Nicolas is not going to leave her. 
No, why would he leave her for you? 
Well, you don't have to be nasty about it. 
Max, I just got another text from Nicolas about him leaving his wife. 
Oleg, now he says he's telling his wife tomorrow at 4:00 that he's leaving her. 
You got a timeframe? 
Oh, if he puts a clock on it, it's happening. 
Pick-up, cantaloupe. 
Max, there's a clock on it. 
But isn't his wife in France? 
Yeah, but they skype every day. 
They're like the French Jetsons. 
He's gonna skype break up with her? 
That is low. 
And smart. 
Might steal that move one day. 
Oh, good, I see your wrist is better, and I'm gonna need some help. 
The cleaning situation has gotten a little complicated. 
The spider communities are at war. 
Han, I can't clean. 
I'm in the middle of ruining someone's marriage. 
Then, Max, please. 
Things are escalating quickly. 
There was a discarded piece of ham, and apparently both kingdoms thought it was theirs. 
Oh, no takers? 
All right, enough with all this texting. 
I need to stop this. 
I have to go over to his place tomorrow, and tell him face to face. 
Tell him face to face? 
I don't even have sex face to face. 
I hope Nicolas takes my breaking it off with him okay, because in my fantasy when I told him, he wouldn't take no for an answer, bought me a plane, and I gave Jennifer Lawrence a ride home. 
In my fantasy, a talking dragon gave me a cape That belonged to Jesus. 
But that's probably because I took too many of Deke's Vicodin earlier. 
The lobby told me you were on your way up. 
Caroline, I did not expect you. 
But you knew I'd be coming? 
We need to talk, and Max is here for moral support. 
I know how this works by now. 
Come in. 
Okay, how do I put this? 
How do I put this? Nicolas, 
I came here today to tell you... 
to not do that. 
But why? 
I want you so much. 
Okay, you... 
You don't want me. 
You don't even really know me. 
I do. You're sexy 
and funny and pretty and smart. 
Okay, you know me a little. 
Look, I am not the type of person who breaks up marriages. 
No, she's the "almost" girl. 
She almost breaks up marriages. 
Yes, yes, that's who I am. 
So I don't want you to make that call, and break up with your wife over Skype. 
I am not breaking up with her over Skype. 
Okay, great, perfect. 
No skype. 
No. Because that's her in the lobby. 
I'm breaking up with her in person. 
Oh, my God, that's your wife in the lobby? 
Your wife is here? 
What are we gonna do? 
Calm down. I can fix this. 
You need a fake mustache, a fistful of paprika, and a new passport. 
If you don't have all three of those things, I can make it work with two, as long as one of them is a mustache. 
There's no other way out. 
Come on, Max, we have to get out of here now. 
Oh, oh, yeah, and, uh... 
Don't leave your wife for me. 
Whatever we had, it's over. 
Oh, and... 
This shouldn't reflect badly on me in school, 'cause I worked hard for that C-minus. 
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
Okay, but only because she just got out of the elevator. 
She can't find me here. 
I can't be this girl. 
I don't want to be the whore he's leaving her for. 
That's my favorite Dr. Seuss book. 
Caroline, what are you saying? 
You were just leading me on this whole time? 
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Hold it, Pep� Le Pew. 
And, yes, I've been saving that one for after finals. 
It is not just Caroline. 
You've been chasing after her harder than a fat kid in a rolling doughnut contest. 
 That's true. 
 Wait, wait, Caroline. 
Do we still have a shot or not? 
No. 
Then better go hide in the bathroom. 
I don't want this screwing up my marriage. 
What? 
Well, if you're not going to be with me, I'm going to have to stay with my wife. 
I mean, I'm a man. 
I cannot be alone. 
Now, go, go, go. 
She cannot find you here in our apartment. 
Why don't you just tell her the truth, that nothing happened between us? 
She will not believe me. 
I have a history. 
There are two of us here. 
I also have that history. 
Nicolas, c'est moi. 
Now go, please. That's the least 
you can do after ruining my life. 
Almost. 
Almost ruined your life. 
Come on, Max. 
This is totally inconvenient. 
My "C" better go up to a "B." 
This is crazy, us hiding in a married man's bathroom like a couple of cheap floozies. 
So far, I'm just hearing a factual depiction of what's happening here. 
Let me see what's going on. 
I can't understand them. 
I thought you spoke French. 
Only enough to impress Americans. 
Je dois utiliser les toilettes. 
Oh, my God. Les toilettes. 
Les toilettes, that's where we are. 
She's coming in here! 
What should we do? 
Pretend we're hot plumbers? 
Hide in the shower. 
I think she might notice us. 
You know that's all glass, right? 
Let me just get you a clean hand towel. 
She has to pee-pee. 
She can't come in here to use the toilet, 'cause my life is in it. 
I know, this is unfortunate. 
So go out the window. 
What? 
It's not a problem. 
There's a ledge wide enough for you to walk to the neighbor's terrace, jump, and get away. 
Stephanie did it. 
Who's Stephanie? 
That's... not important. 
She's fine. 
Now go. 
You have to go. 
Unless you think you and I still have a shot. 
I'll be on the ledge. 
Come on, Max. 
No way, not happening, Lucy. 
If he loses his bad marriage, I'm responsible. 
Almost. 
Almost responsible. 
Max, I wouldn't even be in this situation if I wasn't working with him to put you through pastry school. 
Oh, so this is my fault? 
Max, please just let it be your fault. 
It's completely doable. 
By the way, it's raining. 
Come on. 
We can do this. 
We've crawled 15 feet on our roof to get illegal cable. 
Yeah, for the Breaking Bad finale! 
Something worth dying for! 
Oh. 
Oh, my God, are you insane? 
Get back in here! 
Max, maybe you're right. 
We should've taken the hot plumber route. 
I'm coming back. 
My legs won't go! 
Max, help me back! 
Damn it. 
Damn it, bitch. 
She's in the bathroom. 
Oh, she closed the window. 
And she locked it. So go. 
Go, go! 
If Stephanie did it, we can too. 
I can't believe we're up here all because of him. 
I am such a bad judge of character. 
Of course you are. 
I'm your best friend. 
Max, I'm sorry. 
This is bad. 
Well, at least it can't get any worse, unless we fall. 
 Oh! 
 Or it starts to hail! 
Ow! Ow! 
Hurts like "hail!" 
It's clear! Come on! 
I don't wanna die! 
Me neither! 
That's weird. 
For the first time in my life, I don't want to die. 
I have a boyfriend and my first "B." 
Oh, God, I'm getting soft! 
I can't die! 
I haven't made my comeback yet. 
In my fantasy, you and I move into that penthouse I bought from Jennifer Lawrence. 
Right over there, with the roof garden, see? 
Are you two all right? 
I mean, whoever you are. 
Am I dead? 
Almost. Almost dead. 
Oh, my God. 
What happened to you two? 
Well, we crashed through a window. 
It was pretty dope. 
It was kinda like a Die Hard movie, if they ever let girls do cool stuff in those movies. 
The necks all right? 
We have whiplash, and I have some bruises on my back. 
Max took the brunt of the fall but feels nothing, because she's mostly made of Vicodin. 
Well, I'm glad you survived, because I don't know what I would do without you around here. 
Aw, thanks, Earl. 
I meant you. 
I know. 
Max, how were you ever strong enough to hold me up with one arm? 
It's the arm I used to drag my mother out of bars with as a baby. 
Well, I want to say something to you. 
I hope you know that if you were the one that slipped on that ledge... 
I would be dead. 
Well, I'm glad that's out in the open. 
Everybody! 
I have an update about my life! 
Oh, whoa. 
What happened to you two? 
Sophie, we had an accident. 
It's a long story. 
Yeah, all of yours are. 
Well, I'm out of the movie business. 
I broke up with my bigwig from Miramax. 
We got in a huge fight, and he threw his big wig at me. 
He told me I'd never eat lunch in this town again. 
And I said, "Hey, if I'm in town, I'm eating lunch, baby!" 
Oh, no. 
No, no, no, I don't have spider bites over half my body So you two could fake another injury. 
Nice try. 
Oh! 
Ooh, I'll bet that hurts. 
Happy St. Patrick's day! 
Guinness and Irish cream cupcakes for everyone! 
Enjoy your blackout! 
These are the last 12 cupcakes. 
Actually, two of them are just potatoes from the diner. 
At some point I started putting green icing on anything I could find. 
Max, we haven't been so busy since someone spray-painted free sex stuff on the wall outside. 
And you said I'm not good at marketing. 
Happy St. Patrick's day. 
Bridget, Patrick, John, Mary, and you, the little one, come over here. 
We're here to pick up our order. 
Huh. Should be here 
to pick up birth control. 
Coming right up. 
Max, I know I told you I hated St. Patrick's day 
because the only people who go out are drunk trash... 
We prefer to be called "intoxicated garbage." 
But that was before I knew that drunk trash carried cash. 
Nobody gonna pinch me today, 'cause I got all this green. 
Oh, money's involved, and all of a sudden you're Erin go Bragh? 
Or in your case, "Erin go training bra"? 
Who wants cupcakes? 
Yay! 
It was so worth being open this morning. 
We can use this St. Patrick's day money 
to spring for some new pillows. 
Or even just pillows. 
Or just go to a bar and fall asleep on a couple of fat guys. 
Okay, how much did we make? 
Show me the money. 
$351! 
Show me the rest of the money. 
Fine, I took $3. 
That's it? 
Fine, I took 5. 
Can't a bitch get a foot-long? 
But we worked so hard. 
I have so much green under my fingernails it looks like I had really good sex with shrek. 
What other kind could you have with him? 
Green guys make black guys look like white guys. 
I love St. Patrick's day. 
Tell me one good thing about it. 
Top o' the mornin'! 
Look, it's a Lepre-Han. 
So what do you think? 
I'm concerned. If you're out here, 
Who's guarding your lucky charms? 
You laugh now, and probably all night long, but with this costume my chances of getting laid are higher than ever. 
So zero? 
Nope, 100%. 
What makes you so confident? 
'cause the only answer I can think of right now is that you have cocaine in your wee pocket. 
Hey, I can see it. 
You're out drunk on St. Patrick's day, 
And it seems like a good idea to bang a Leprechaun. 
Like the Presidents' Day I hooked up with a guy dressed like uncle sam at the used car lot. 
This costume is my ace in the hole. 
Well, it does make you look like an ace hole. 
Nice outfit, Han. 
You look like a pimp I used to use in Vietnam. 
Come on, let's hit the parade. 
Look, Oleg, this is America. 
You could have an accent or a suspicious package, but you can't have both. 
Relax. 
It's just my inventory. 
I'm gonna sell t-shirts. 
That is revolting. 
Put me down for five. 
You might also be interested in my other choice product. 
Pee funnels. 
I might also not be interested in that product. 
It's a disposable funnel for upwardly mobile, elegant, Young ladies who want to stand and pee in the street like a man. 
I mean, have you seen those parade port-a-potties? 
Seen 'em? 
I was conceived in one. 
Just slip one of these babies into your pants And go pee in the park, no muss, no fuss. 
Well, a little muss, some fuss. 
And possibly a very unpleasant paper cut. 
That's revolting. 
Put me down for five. 
Better make it six, 'cause if it's for ladies, Han's definitely gonna need one. 
Max, barhopping with a horny Leprechaun And a pee funnel salesman? 
Not exactly my scene. 
Can't you just go with Deke? 
This is boyfriend stuff, meaning he's gross like you. 
I know, but he's snowboarding somewhere called vail with something called a family. 
Here, we gotta lay down a layer of grease to absorb all the booze we'll be drinking tonight. 
This'll hold us over till our 3:00 a.m. street meet, 
Which'll hold us over till our noon-30 rooty-tooty fresh and fruity breakfast. 
Come on, start layering. 
I miss my old St. Patrick's day 
tradition. 
Wanna hear it? 
Hell, no. 
Well, from 16 to 21, my friends and I... 
Boys were there too, Even though technically they weren't allowed... 
By 16, I was thrice divorced and a member of the electricians' union, but go on. 
We'd rent a big suite at the plaza overlooking the parade, And we'd fill balloons with champagne and... 
And throw them down at the parade crowd! 
So fun, right? 
Oh, wait, that was you guys? 
One year you hit me and my friend archie. 
He sells car seat covers in Rhode Island now. 
He's doing pretty well. 
Max, why are you dragging ass on the night I'm supposed to get some? 
Stop talking about sex wearing that body. It's gross. 
We've been stuck in traffic for, like, an hour. 
I could've had 37 Guinnesses by now. 
And broken the Guinness World Record for most Guinnesses. 
Is this cab even moving? 
Is that a new McDonald's or the same one? 
It's the same one, Unless that bum's on a masturbation tour of Manhattan. 
Come on! Make 'em move! 
Hit the horn again! 
If you touch my horn again, I cut your hand off! 
Okay, big shot. 
Do it. Do it, if it'll 
get us there faster. 
Look, I know I said I'd spring for a cab, but it's $70! 
And I'm gonna need that for a junior king room At the holiday inn express! 
Don't worry, Han, we'll chip in. 
No, we won't. We need that $356. 
That's all we made today. 
It has to last till we're 82. 
This is our funeral money, Max. 
Don't worry, we'll make more money. 
Not much more, but a little bit. 
Damn it! 
I can hear the bagpipers coming this way. 
They're playing closing time. 
That means the parade's over. 
Now I'm never gonna sell the pee funnels. 
All right, I gotta move some t-shirts. 
Heads up, peoples! 
"Kiss me I'm Irish" crotch tees. $15. 
Or two for 25! Five for 60! 
You nobody! 
You can't sell those out the window. 
That's illegal. 
You need a permit! 
Just drive, grandma. 
I can't believe you call yourself Russian. 
Doesn't seem like you're rushin' anywhere. 
You say that again, and I'll cut your tongue out! 
Oh, now you're gonna cut out my tongue? 
Why do you want to punish all the women in the tri-state area? 
Look, oh, my God, it's Earl! 
Earl, what're you doing here? 
Hey, y'all! 
This is my bagpipe group Black Irish. 
I'm black, they're Irish. 
Why didn't you tell us you were coming to the parade? 
Well, I kinda like to keep my skirt wearing on the D.L. 
When did you learn how to play bagpipes? 
I do not know. 
I took too much acid once, and, when the trip ended, I could play the bagpipes and drive a stick. 
I'll catch up with you at Blarney's. 
Han, pay the man. 
It's ten blocks away. 
We can walk. 
In these shoes? 
Ugh, green beer. 
Is this really how we honor the Irish, Some of our greatest writers and poets? 
Oh, did they come up with, "If you sprinkle when you tinkle, be a sweetie, wipe the seatie"? 
First of all, not a real poem. 
And as the person who shares your bathroom, Maybe take that advice. 
Maybe take that frown and get it drunk. 
Okay, sure, we're two young girls on the town On what's probably America's most dangerous holiday. 
Why... why have our wits about us? 
That's the spirit. 
And who knows? Maybe you'll 
meet a cute, Irish guy. 
Happy St. Paddy's day! 
Blarney Bill. 
Are you the owner of this colorful establishment? 
I'm not even the owner of these pants. 
Where's me kiss? 
Blarney bill is like the mascot of this place. 
Every year I kiss him for good luck. 
And when does that luck kick in? 
Where's me kiss? 
I left it in me other purse? 
Wow. That's a wet moustache. 
Scotch and fish. 
What? 
That's why it's wet! 
Man, he's the best. 
The best what? 
Hey, girls! 
Sold my last shirt. 
Hey, told you that small would fit. 
Look at han at that table with all those... 
I want to say "girls..." 
waiting to take pictures with him. 
Mm, Becca! 
Be-becca! 
Over here. 
Oh, no, you're not Becca. 
Hey, though. 
Are you guys in line to take pictures with the Leprechaun? 
No. 
$5. 
Wait, what? 
Ah, yes, we are the Leprechaun's McAgent and McManager. 
It'll be $5 to take a selfie with the Leprechaun. 
That is a great deal. 
Max, I am not doing this. 
Fine. Then we'll have to use the 
cupcake money for our cab home. 
Okay, that there is virgin Leprechaun. 
So it's $10. 
10 for a picture, 15 for a kiss, nothing below the waist. 
That's 'cause there's nothing below the waist. 
Will you take a 20? 
I mean, I guess. 
Just so you know, if you're an orphan, I'm interested. 
Are you over here making money off of me, You wolves of Wall Street? 
We're just taking advantage of drunk people. 
It's a St. Paddy's tradition, 
Like corned beef or punching a cop. 
Well, then maybe you can get them to take advantage of me. 
Get a little handsy on hansy. 
I've got my eye on that buxom paralegal. 
The one over there who brought in outside chicken? 
Hook daddy up! 
So I'm going up to the woman who brought her own two-liter of coke to a bar to ask her for money to touch you. 
That's the gist. 
What's happened to my life? 
Where am I? 
Blarney's! 
Oh, God, it's Blarney Bill. 
Hey, that's my name! 
Where's me kiss? 
Oh, well, I... 
I have to go to the ladies' room And wash whatever is on my mouth and in my mouth off my mouth and out of my mouth. 
We've been in this line so long, now I actually have to pee. 
Max, are you eating chicken? 
She didn't have 10 bucks to tickle Han, So she paid me in purse chicken. 
I think I came out ahead. 
Uh, sorry, back of the line. 
No cuts. 
Please. I'm feeling sick. 
Sorry, no cuts, no buts, no coconuts. 
Is that one of those famous Irish poems too? 
I totally understand. 
Yeah, I get it. 
Just let her cut. 
It's St. Patrick's day. 
She's having fun. 
Not to bring up my St. Patrick's 
day tradition at the plaza... 
Oh, good. 
But it was so much better than this place. 
I mean, there were no lines. 
We'd sit like non-animals in the palm court and sip Bellinis. 
I'm taking you to palm court if you tell that story one more time. 
Guys. 
I just threw up. 
And you're carrying it around like a baby chick? 
I-I think I'm gonna need some water. 
I have to drive a school bus in four hours. 
You're a great American. 
I know what I am. 
Ahem! 
Oh! 
Where's me kiss? 
Uh, she has it. 
Ah! 
Dodged a bullet. 
Bullet found ya. 
Come on. I have to find 
another bathroom. 
I'm not peeing anywhere near Blarney Bill. 
I don't want him to find "me kiss" when I have me pants down. 
I gave him your number. 
Is that cool? 
Oh, no. I don't think 
I'm gonna make it. 
You mean in life? 
Yeah, me neither. 
No, it's all that green beer. 
And if I wet myself here on 53rd street, I'll be forced to abandon you, move to the Midwest, And start a new life. 
I have a bathroom you can use. 
I've hit some very low points today, but I'm not about to pee through a paper penis in public. 
Here, quick, just pop a squat over here behind the float, I'll block you so no one'll see, And the 15 high school marching bands'll mask the sound of you hitting rock bottom. 
Gimme that thing. 
Damn it, Max. Damn it! 
How do I do this? 
Well, I do have my master's in public urination from Devry. 
Just unzip, put it in your pants, and let a river run through it. 
No one's looking, right? 
Nope. 
Hi, Caroline. 
Sophie, you were in the parade? 
Of course I was. 
You can't be a volunteer firefighter without being in the parade. 
You're a volunteer firefighter? 
Well, I do go down to the station voluntarily. 
Besides, every fire station needs a pole, And I'm it, baby. 
Anyway, we're all going to Blarney's. 
Shots on me. 
And by that I mean shots on me. 
Come on. 
When the firemen's pole offers you drinks, you say yes. 
Max, I am not going back in there. 
In fact, I'm treating you to a drink at the plaza. 
You know that money we were saving for our funeral? 
That's no longer an issue because I just died right then. 
Rest in pee, Caroline. 
Look, Max, our Bellinis. 
Thank you, Claude. 
He's a plaza institution. 
And I just remembered his name is Rolph. 
You forgot the name rolph After we just saw a girl do that in her hands? 
Isn't it lovely here? 
Less Blarney's, more Barney's. 
And trust me, these Bellinis are famous. 
Why? 
Did they make a sex tape? 
Ooh, kind of tastes like the time I put canned peaches in my boxed wine. 
Max, a plaza Bellini is a far cry from boxed wine. 
Well, my rule is, if I have to refrigerate it, it's fancy. 
I'm talkin' to you, batteries. 
You know, tonight is really bringing up How much I miss the old me. 
Yeah, tonight is really bringing up how much I miss my friend Archie. 
Who? 
The guy you hit with the champagne balloons. 
Sells car seat covers in Rhode Island. 
You know how I said he was doing really well? 
Truth is I haven't talked to him in a year. 
Really dropped the ball. 
And the most exciting thing about this place... 
Those elevator doors can open, and you never know who's gonna step off. 
Max, this is nice. 
Max, this is boring. 
What happened? 
Nothing. 
Absolutely nothing. 
Now I'm thinking maybe this wasn't as much fun as I thought it was. 
Now I'm thinking Archie's dead. 
'Cause I feel like I got a text about it and ignored it. 
Even this Bellini doesn't taste as good. 
I knew it, my taste buds must have committed suicide after my first 7-Eleven sushi. 
I mean, nothing is the same. 
Why did I think this was fun? 
Because before you met me, you didn't know what fun was. 
I get your point, Max, But I did own a Caribbean Island with six jet skis. 
Oh, come on, get over it. 
Drink up. It's not that bad. 
Can you just let me feel sad? 
No! 
Not on St. Patrick's day. 
You have a good time, and you don't think about your problems. 
That girl who threw up in her hands, She didn't sit around saying, "Eh, meh, my life sucks." 
No, she threw her hands in the air, Hit a lot of people with the vomit, and kept the party going. 
Yeah, the party was all over everybody's shoes. 
Look, it doesn't matter that this is literally the stupidest place I've ever been in my whole frickin' life. 
Let's get another $40 Roberto Benigni and keep our party going. 
Come on, let's go. 
There's no party here. 
There may be a $3 million bat mitzvah happening upstairs, but there's no party here. 
But I do know where there is one. 
We'll just take the check, Rolph. 
And I just remembered his name is Dennis. 
Max, I'm sorry if I rained on your parade today. 
Well, peed on it. 
Don't worry about it. 
Everything that means something to me gets peed on. 
Hey, girls! 
I heard you left! 
You missed me winning the hula-hooping contest. 
When did you learn how to hula-hoop? 
Once again, I do not know. 
You're still rocking the bagpipe ensemble. 
I thought you wanted to keep your skirt wearing on the low-low. 
That was before I discovered the sensation of a cool breeze circling my bag and my pipe. 
Hey! Max, Caroline! 
Excuse me, move it. 
Move it. Move it. 
Hey, move it. 
Wanna break my big-ass clover? 
Girls, where did you go? 
We went to the plaza, and I realized my life may actually be richer now than when I was rich. 
Oh, no. Is it too late to walk away? 
Can you girls loan me some cash? 
I met a girl, and I need money for the bus back from her sister's condo in Jersey City. 
She said we've got to be quiet, but I make no promises. 
Sure. I gotcha, Han. 
What do you need, a 20? 
Oh, what the hell? Take 50. 
We can always make more. 
Or not. 
Look at you throwing the cash around. 
You know, girl, there might be hope for you yet. 
Jeanine, I'm good to go. 
Told you, girls. 100%. 
Looks like they're both gonna get unlucky tonight. 
Hey, Max, Caroline, over here! 
I save ya a couple of seats. 
And a couple of firemen. 
Uh, there's no place to sit. 
Oh, you are so green. 
'Sup? 
Happy St. Paddy's day! 
Where's me kiss? 
Oh... 
Mm... 
Scotch and fish! 
Stealing Han's dishes, so we don't have to clean our at home is genius. 
And a little sad. 
You kidding? This is the greatest 
thing that's happened to me since I got my period this morning. 
Max, Caroline, you're stealing my dishes? 
Damn it, I didn't think you could see up this high. 
And I didn't think you could sink this low. 
Okay, stop, you're already robbing me blind with your "I'm a waitress" scam. 
Sorry, but things have gotten kind of messy at home. 
Yesterday, I had to take a shower to shower off the shower I took. 
You two should get a cleaning lady. 
I have a woman I pay to clean my apartment. 
She is expensive, but she may charge you less if you don't also have sex on her. 
I'll look into it. 
My grandmother cleaned the house free of charge. 
Of course she didn't have a say in the matter. 
Let's just ask Sophie. 
She has a cleaning service. 
We have to do something. 
Yesterday, I saw a roach walk out of our apartment. 
Look. 
I'm gonna tell you what I told that guy who asked me to use my butt to smuggle opium. 
I'll do it! 
Season 3, Episode 9 "And the Pastry Porn" Be ready, Max. 
We have to leave as soon as the cleaning lady gets here. 
It's housekeeper etiquette. 
In my old life, I go to spin class and lunch with friends, but you and I will just go outside and watch the guy who just got out of jail do pull-ups on the light post. 
Calvin's out? 
I'm not gonna leave. 
I want to watch her clean up my mess. 
Yeah, baby. 
I've waited my whole life to have a servant. 
I thought you were gonna be it for the first few weeks and then I realized you can't do anything. 
And even though Sophie gave us a discount, the maid still has to call me "Your Highness." 
Mostly because I'm pretty "highness" right now. 
Hi, girls. 
Here I am. 
Sophie from Sophie's Choice Cleaning Service. 
Meet your cleaning lady Paulina. 
Paulina, meet the girls. 
She'd shake hands, but she only has one arm. 
Sophie, she can hear you. 
So what? 
I know I'm missing arm. 
It's not news. 
So she lost an arm. 
I lost my gold earring down the garbage disposal but I was too afraid to reach into it because, well, yeah. 
Don't worry. 
I have one arm but I clean like I have three. 
I put on more makeup, then I start. 
I'm sorry. I didn't realize 
when I ordered a cleaning lady I had to specify I wanted one with two arms. 
You can't afford two arms. 
You said you wanted a good price. 
Half the arms, half the price. 
Is that how she lost the arm, Sophie? 
You cut it off so we could get a discount? 
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, I sawed off 
her arm so I could save you 10 bucks. 
I start in bedroom. 
Wait, before you do, one question. 
How'd you lose it? 
James Franco situation? 
You had to cut it off to get loose? 
You're not saying no. 
Oh, you know what, let's not go there. 
You know, it happened, it was in the past. 
I was trapped under this big truck. 
We get it. 
I drove over your arm. 
Hey, don't even bother looking for my good jewelry in there because I'm already wearing all of it. 
Oh, I'm jealous I don't have arm to wear cheap jewelry. 
Max, I feel bad for her. See? 
This is why you leave. 
In case they show up with too much makeup and not enough arms. 
Relax, she's tough. 
Reminds me of a young me. 
Which means I better go hide my pills from her. 
Max, she scares me. 
Oh, come on, she's armless. 
Everything okay? 
You need any help? 
I didn't get this far in this business by taking help. 
Help me! Can't you see 
I got one arm? 
Not gonna be a problem. 
I would occasionally help my maid... 
 You're not interested. 
 Lift! 
Lift, weak girl. 
Lift. 
Max, come here. We need help 
lifting your mattress. 
Can you give us a hand? 
No! Leave it alone! Leave it alone! 
Don't lift up the mattress! 
Ah, porno. 
Your mind is as dirty as your apartment! 
Yes, it's porn. So what? 
What's the big deal? 
It's just the body in its natural form, spread-eagle on a motorcycle. 
Why is so much of it from the '80s? 
I like mustaches, okay? 
And it's multitasking. 
I'm looking for my father. 
Stop looking. 
Stop looking right now. 
Why are you suddenly embarrassed? 
Porn hub is your homepage. 
Hey, is this a brochure for pastry school? 
Why are you hiding a pastry school brochure? 
Your face is a pastry school brochure! 
Max, it's great you're interested in pastry school. 
 I don't know why you're embarrassed. 
 Your face is embarrassed! 
Come on, I really think that this is something we should talk about. 
Your face is something we should talk about! 
You made the scary one mad. 
That was dumb move. 
Your face was a dumb move! 
Max? 
Max, you never came home after you stormed out, so I brought you your uniform. 
Max? 
I live here now. 
My new roommates, the broom and the mop, don't sneak around looking at my stuff. 
I got everything I need. 
Whiskey, toothbrush, toothpaste. 
Well, maybe your new broommate will hold back your hair when you drink too much. 
Which, from the looks of it, will be in about an hour. 
Max, we really need to talk about this brochure. 
Look, just because I have a pastry school brochure doesn't mean I'm actually gonna go to pastry school. 
Just like having those porn magazines doesn't mean I'm actually gonna ride around on a tiger performing unspeakable acts with sailors, probably. 
Pastry school is the same as porn. 
It's just a dumb fantasy. 
Pastry school is not like porn. 
There is nothing in this brochure about a girl-on-girl croissant. 
That's good toothpaste. 
Please stop brushing your teeth. 
We have a shift to do later. 
Okay, the Manhattan school of pastry... 
Your face is the Manhattan school of pastry. 
You know it isn't. 
Max, you could go here for real. 
Tuition is only $3,000 a year. 
A lot, but doable. 
"A lot but doable?" 
Are we talking about pastry school or fat guy at last call? 
Here we are, Max. 
Your dream starts now. 
What, the one where I'm a black mermaid? 
Would you relax? We're just gonna 
look around and get an application. 
See all that gorgeous equipment you get to use if you went here? 
Finally you'd have a mixing bowl that's not a hollowed-out watermelon. 
Can you help me? She's holding me 
against my will. 
She's kidding. 
If you keep this up, young lady, you are not getting ice cream after. 
Fine! 
 Come on, here's the office. 
 Whatever. Are we almost done here? 
I got a court date later. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
I'm not sure we're in the right place. 
Are any of us, really? 
We'd like an application. 
Could you help us? 
Oh, God, I hope so. 
I wasn't expecting something this high-pressure my first day back. 
Let's just say I've been under observation at the nuthouse. 
Okay, application. 
It's for Max, here. She was 
very impressed by your brochure. 
Oh, pastry school. 
Exciting, right? 
I was a chef here once. 
And then I wasn't. 
Oh, look. 
Found the application. 
Wow. Really didn't think I was 
gonna be able to handle that. 
Bebe, if you... 
Oh. Bonjour. Good morning. 
Chef Nicolas, these girls are here for an application. 
Don't worry, I handled it. 
Almost didn't, then I did. 
Nice work, Bebe. 
Oh, do I detect a French accent? Oui? 
Oh, my God, I can't watch. 
French, indeed. 
I'm chef Nicolas Saintcroix, owner and head chef. 
Bienvenue. 
Caroline Channing. 
Is it over yet? 
This is Max. 
The application's for her. 
'Sup, Frenchie? 
You eat snails? 
It looks like Bebe forgot the second page. 
Oh, boy, forgot the second page. 
That's not good. 
I thought I handled it. 
Didn't handle it. 
It's okay, Bebe. 
Breathe in. 
Breathe out. 
That's good stuff. 
She was quite brilliant. 
Then she wasn't. 
Here. Fill that out. 
And the next step is the pastry exam. 
Applicants will have to make a classic tart, bring them in tomorrow for me to taste, and we will go from there. 
Sound good? 
Whatever. 
Maybe I'll think about it. 
Okay, well, maybe you will. 
Nice meeting you both. 
Hope to see you tomorrow, chef. 
He called me chef! 
 Yay! Let's go get ice cream! 
 No! 
You should get started on that tart. 
It's due tomorrow. 
I got plenty of time. Besides, 
pressure ups my game. 
I perform my best when there's a gun to my head. 
Ask any of my ex-boyfriends. 
This is so not how I prepare for tests. 
I studied three weeks for a pap smear. 
Don't worry, I got this. 
A tart's just like a cookie with some pudding on it, right? 
Max, what is going on in here? 
Turns out a tart's more than a cookie with some pudding on it! 
You've been in here six hours. 
You said you had this. 
I thought I had this! Turns out I don't! 
I haven't even finished a shell. 
I didn't know there was a shell. 
Did you know there was a shell? 
Everybody knows there's a shell! 
What the shell is wrong with you? 
I'm a tart who can't make a tart! 
You could've made nine shells by now. 
I did. 
They're all in here. Look. 
It's like Shell-mageddon! 
Oh, screw it. This one's 
gonna be there in a minute. 
Let's just get it over with. 
No, you can do this. Here. Here. 
This still looks ready to go. 
Look at me. Look at me. 
I'm a waste of two arms. 
I can't make a tart! 
How's the tart coming? 
Han, you're not safe. 
Leave. 
You haven't even finished the shell? 
That's the easiest part! 
Han, this is your face. 
Well, I should get going. 
I didn't know she could take bitch to the next level. 
I am so screwed! 
I finally found a situation my boobs can't get me out of! 
Hey, Max. Now, I have all 
the faith in the world in you. 
But here's a tart from Stop 'n Shop in case you wanted to hand this one in. 
No, Earl. 
Max is not a cheater. 
Since when? 
She is going to make her own tart. 
You, out. 
I am never gonna make this shell. 
I can't even get it in the pan right. 
Max, that looks right. 
Oh, my God! I got it in the pan right! 
I can do this! 
You did it! I knew it! 
I helped you. We're besties. 
You're not safe. Leave. 
I'm telling you, Max, I've tasted a lot of tarts, and yours is delicious. 
You are not the first man to tell me that. 
The first man to tell me that is in jail. 
Here he comes. Look at him. 
Here he comes. 
Afternoon, ladies. 
Bien fondue, Eiffel Tower. 
Okay. 
Thank you for coming. 
Shall we begin the tasting? 
This is exciting, huh? 
Keep it in your pants. 
And now for the tart. 
It's Max's first ever. 
I ate a slice earlier and it was like Having a little piece of heaven. 
Don't do anything you're doing. 
It's flaky, creamy... 
For a first attempt, I am very impressed. 
Don't be. I made a tart. 
It's not like I cured herpes or invented a reverse microwave to instantly chill sodas. 
Okay, Max. 
I will talk it over with my faculty and we will let you know. 
I'll let you know. 
Nailed that. 
Max! 
Stop stealing my things! 
You got a cleaning lady! 
Relax. 
I am returning what I took. 
Here's your plates. 
Oh, and here's your ATM card. 
I lifted it from your wallet. 
Oh, and here's your wallet. 
There was $40 in here. 
There sure was. 
At least give me back my gift card from Sephora. 
Caroline, Han wants his Sephora gift card back. 
Oh, that's not happening. 
It's already on my face. 
 Max, look, it's from the pastry school. 
 Whoohoo! My acceptance letter! 
Lot of people talking about my chili in that bathroom. 
Oleg, come here. 
Han, Earl, stay. 
You guys are about to owe me big. 
I am gonna let you witness something extremely rare. 
More rare than a sighting of Bigfoot or a UFO or Han's penis. 
You held me here so I could hear that? 
Behold, the rarest sight of them all. 
You are about to see something good actually happen to me. 
Listen to this. 
"Dear Ms. Black, 
after careful consideration "of our large pool of applicants, we regret to inform you..." 
Oh, I guess I didn't get in. 
Looking back, we probably should have insisted she read that to herself, first. 
I know why she didn't get in. 
Her name. 
They saw the word "Black" and stopped reading. 
That's why I didn't get into law school. 
I also didn't apply. 
This is terrible. 
I'm gonna go see if she's okay. 
Who does that French frog think he is? 
He thinks he can have the time of his life tasting my tart and then never see me again? 
He won't let me into his school? 
Well, I won't take no for an answer. 
I am going down there right now and giving him a piece of my mind. 
I am storming out. 
And I am storming back in. 
It is dark outside. 
That school's not open. 
Hey, you. Tart tease, 
we need a word. 
Oh, boy. 
What? You love 
my pastries and then regret to inform me I'm not good enough for your school? 
Well, I regret to inform you that I am good enough and I want to know why you won't let me in here. 
Okay, uh, your voice is an anxiety trigger for me. 
I'm going to have to remove myself from the situation and go sit in the hallway. 
Can you come with me? You have 
a very calming presence. 
Thank you. So few people 
think that about me. 
But I should stay with Max. 
No, I got this handled. 
You can have her. 
This is the last time you give me to someone. 
Max, your tart was excellent. 
The problem was your attitude. 
You showed no passion of wanting to be in this school. 
And that is why you didn't get in. 
It seemed like you didn't want it. 
No, no, no, that's just my attitude. 
I act like I don't want anything because I never got anything I wanted. 
But I do want to go to this school more than I've ever wanted anything. 
It's my fantasy and my dream, and please stop making me use these horrible, horrible words! 
Just let me in, okay? 
Okay. 
Wait, for real? 
Yes. I needed to see if your passion 
was as good as your pastry and you just showed me it was. 
I'm thrilled to have you on board, chef. 
Thanks, chef. 
Bebe is having a panic attack and needs to hold her lemon. 
Has anyone seen her lemon? 
Caroline, he let me in. 
I'm going to pastry school. 
Everybody has to call me "chef" now! 
You did it, chef! 
You're going to the pastry school from the brochure! 
Aren't you glad I looked at your porn? 
We're roommates. Both single. 
Quelle surprise. 
So Max, once you fill out these, you will be officially enrolled. 
And of course we will need your tuition check. 
Yup. $3,000. 
It's a lot for us. 
But if we make some cutbacks, 1/2-ply toilet paper. 
Who am I kidding? 
No toilet paper, diner napkins. 
No, tuition is 24,000. 
But the brochure said $3,000 a year. 
You misread it. 
It's $3,000 a unit. 
There is eight units per year. 
24,000. 
It costs $24,000? 
We can't pay that. 
Oh, my God, now I'm never gonna be able to come here and I just admitted I wanted to! 
I take back everything I ever said about wanting anything. 
 Max, you can't just storm out. 
 Your face can't just storm out! 
Look, I will do anything for that girl to go to this school. 
In exchange for tuition, I could work in the office. 
Bebe clearly needs someone to help take the pressure off and who better than a mentally stable Wharton graduate like myself? 
But I'll do anything. 
I'll even wash your floors, okay? 
Although I'm sure there's something better than that. 
But if you need me to wash the floors, I will wash the floors. 
Really would prefer to do anything else, but I'll do it, 'cause I'll do anything to get her into this school. 
Please no floors. 
Okay, I will talk it over with my staff and I will let you know. 
Oh, no, no. 
I've seen what happens when you give people the "I'll let you know." 
I'm not going anywhere until you let me know to my face. 
With your face. 
Your beautiful, beautiful face. 
Max, we're not poor enough? 
You're starting a hobo trash fire in our apartment? 
Yup. I'm burning my porn 
and pastry school brochure. 
You know, all my fantasies. 
If I learned anything in life it's that nothing's more flammable than my dreams. 
 Are those my slipper socks in there? 
 Yeah, those needed to die too. 
Well, while you were in our living room hosting a burning man festival, I was at the pastry school getting us a work-study arrangement. 
And... 
 You're going to pastry school. 
 No way! 
Here you go. 
Your school uniform. 
This is where my name's gonna go! 
My chef name, Conchita Bonfire. 
Thank you for this. 
And for everything. 
You don't have to thank me. 
'Cause with your new skills I'm gonna use you like Kim uses Kanye. 
Or Kanye uses Kim. I'm not sure 
which of them is winning. 
What kind of work-study arrangement did you make for me? 
It's more of a work-study arrangement for us. 
I'll be working in the office helping out Bebe, so I'm working, you're studying. 
You're working at my school? Mom! 
 Good evening, ladies. 
 No. 
Max, what are you doing? 
I know this neighborhood is a circus, but our window's becoming a freak show. 
Max, I don't think that bearded lady earlier was doing it on purpose. 
It's more of a menopause thing. 
He can't afford a cupcake. 
He can't even afford two wheels. 
Hi. What can I get you? 
 I'll take one vanilla. 
 That'll be $4. 
Actually, madam, tonight I'll be paying with a poem. 
We're paying with a poem, madam. 
I pull. 
Shadows push. 
I was a child then. 
I was a child then. 
Spit it out. 
Hey, you want a poem? 
Roses are red, violets are blue, get a job! 
And another wheel! 
That felt good. 
I get why you do that. 
Wait till you get actual fist-to-face contact. That's a real high. 
Season 3, Episode 12 "And the French Kiss" Welcome to the Williamsburg diner, Deke. 
Where'd you hear about us? 
Kitchen nightmares? 
Okay, Max, let's get to it. 
We have to decide what we're each gonna make for our pastry school homework. 
Or true to form, I'll blow it off, beat you up, and take yours. 
Of the top of my giant head, I'm thinking sticky buns. 
Deke's dark sticky buns. 
We're talking about dessert, not what's going on in your pants. 
Well, I would've baked brownies, until I remembered I smoked all the ingredients. 
Oh, my God, guess who texted me again. 
Dame Judi Dench? 
Dame Judes texts me all the time. 
She's thirsty. 
More like, "Damn, Judi Drench." 
Oh, hi, Deke. 
Didn't know you were here. 
You're everywhere. 
Pastry school, on the phone with Max talking about pastry school, and now here at the counter talking about elder sex with a beloved star of stage and screen. 
 You're like... 
 What? 
Denzel Washington trapped in Channing Tatum's body? 
I get that a lot. 
Anyway, Max, this is the fourth time chef Nicolas has texted me outside of school. 
And this time he sent me a video. Look. 
Then, Caroline, you spoon the fat from the pan... 
It's him making breakfast with his shirt open. 
What do you think it means? 
That he doesn't have a fear of bacon splatters...? 
 He's totally flirting with me, right? 
 Totally. Chef Nicolas is hot for ya. 
He has to double up on aprons when you're around, know what I'm sayin'? 
Deke, this is just private best friend stuff between girls. 
You know, that you're not a part of. 
Can I not be a part of it? 
And since chef Nicolas is your teacher and I work at the school, I'd appreciate it if we kept this just between us three. 
And me. I saw it 
over your shoulder. 
Doesn't hold a candle to my series of pantless meatloaf videos. 
Meatloaf. 
Pick up. 
Okay, okay, Max, if you have time to lean, you have time to clean. 
And if I have time to give you a punch, we have time to have lunch. 
Max, should we help him find his mom? 
Oh, no, now there's two of them. 
Like gremlins. 
Now, come on. This is a diner, 
not study hall. You're working. 
I call it "spiritually dying," but working's a good word for what we do here too. 
We could figure it out tomorrow night over some drinks. 
Couple of white wine spritzers. 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
That you're a recently-widowed woman on a girls' trip in Boca? 
Well, I already ate my water, so I'm good to go. 
I am out the door. 
Hi, I'm Deke. 
Bye, Max. 
Oh, he's your friend? 
For a minute I thought he was that kid I had out of wedlock with Linda Evans. 
Okay, why are you in here not working? 
And why are you doing it without me? 
Look, I've been texting with Nicolas. 
He thirstay. 
He wants me to meet him for a drink after his dinner tomorrow. 
After his dinner. 
You know what that means. 
That he thinks he doesn't have to buy you dinner before he makes you his slam piece? 
"After dinner" is a Booty call. 
Or as they say in France, "A call du bootay." 
So I need you to hang out with me, because if I don't have anything else to do at that time, I won't be able to resist him. 
I don't see it. 
Maybe because he never pulled a knife on me, but to me he's, like, asexual. 
Yeah, like a sexual object. 
Okay, well, I told Deke I'd help him with his homework, so you can hang out with us. 
Hang out with Deke? 
I didn't even like the Muppets on TV. 
But fine, it'll... 
It'll keep me busy, because Max, when Nicolas looks at me, it does something to my insides, and I want this to be a relationship before he does something to my insides. 
If you keep talking about your insides, I'm gonna kick you on your outsides. 
Okay, so as far as my dessert homework goes... 
He just texted me again. 
"Ou es-tu?" 
"Where are you?" 
And he used "tu", not "vous." 
We've gone there. 
Then why are you still here? 
Because I can't go there, Max, I'm not ready. 
Oh, wax situation? 
Guys don't care about that. 
So as far as my dessert goes, I went all-out and actually did some real research. 
 You googled desserts with dirty names? 
 Correcto. 
And it was harder to pick one than I thought. 
I mean, you got your bundt cake, your lady fingers, kumquat pie... 
"Kum" and "quat". 
It was right there the whole time. How could I not see it? 
So I dug deep, and I have the winner. 
Croquembouche. 
I don't know what that is, but she sounds like a whore. 
It's a traditional French wedding cake with vanilla cream-filled profiteroles dipped in hand-made caramel. 
Said the only person here not in pastry school. 
Oh, cool. 
I didn't know what it was. 
Maybe I can help. I happen to know Nicolas 
loves a pear tarte tatin. 
Ta-ta-tan! No. 
I thought I'd distract myself by going out with you guys, but it feels like the day in high school I hung out with the smokers for street cred. 
And I used to hang out with rich geeks like you when I needed lunch money. 
I'm texting Nicolas. 
What? You said you didn't 
want him to think you were up for a wham-bam, thank you, mademoiselle. 
You're right, Max. 
I shouldn't text him. 
He just texted me again. 
What's one drink? 
$18...? 
It is? 
Yeah, you better text him. 
We need a grown-up to pay for the drinks. 
I'll just say I'm with friends, and he can join for a drink. 
Isn't that what people do? 
I forget. 
I haven't been a person or done anything in so long. 
Or done a person in so long. 
I won't let it get that far. 
And by that I mean you won't. 
I'll give you a signal and then you'll say we have to go. 
What's the signal? 
Full penetration? 
 No, before that. 
 So, just the tip? 
I think I'll just wink. 
So, croquembouche? 
I can't pretend to talk. 
I hope his tongue is wearing protection. 
Hey. 
Are we making you uncomfortable? 
No, no, it's just that I usually like to fast-forward through the kissing parts when I watch porn. 
Come on, relax, Max. 
We're just having some fun. 
It's just that you're our teacher, and your spittle is all over her mouth. 
We're not in class. 
Do you see batter or bowls? 
Well, we're hoping not to see any balls. 
I see the outline of one of 'em. 
Just don't think of me as a teacher right now. 
Well, I'm kind of learning a lot. 
You know, for someone who wasn't gonna have sex, she's having sex. 
I'm leaving. 
I haven't felt this awkward since my mom had sex with my prom date in the limo and made me drive. 
Your mom sounds cool. 
Come on, you can't leave. 
We just got here. 
Well, she's about to get there, and I don't wanna see it. 
Well, we can make out. 
You wanna make out? With me? 
No, a comedy make-out. 
You know, like... 
Well, you make it look so tempting. 
Come on, it'll be hilarious. 
Let my mouth be your tongue's panic room. 
And chef Nicolas could use a few pointers. 
Yeah, he's really bad at it. 
All right, why not? It might 
even get their attention. 
On the count of three. 
One, two... 
 Did they look? 
 No, he's busy rounding third. 
My turn. 
Max, what's happening? 
Hey. 
He's licking your face. 
Leave them alone. 
Deke seems to know what he's doing. 
Respect. 
Well, hate to comedy make out and run, but, well, I'm already mentally at yummy donuts trying to binge eat this image out of my mind. 
Hold on, Max. The signal. 
See, this is why I don't do girlfriend. 
Come on, we have somewhere to go or be, something like that. 
Well... 
We have to go. 
See you later. 
Au revoir. 
'Sup? 
Not much. 
'Sup with you? 
Sorry, I have to get this. 
It's my wife. 
Hello? 
Girrrl... 
Oh, I totally forgot to tell you. 
You're terrible at making out. 
Well, I never had a father to teach me. 
Hey, big Mary. 
Hallway lunch. 
Love that for you. 
And you. 
This could've been your walk of shame right now if I hadn't stepped in, Winky. 
Yes, last night got a little out of hand. 
Oh, it was pretty much in your hand. 
No, it was not, Max. 
Yes, there might have been a tasteful graze, just to figure out how European he was down there. 
Good news, it's not wearing a floppy beret. 
So we are right on track for a perfect fairy-tale romance. 
Yeah, the princess and the penis. 
See you at the diner, Max. 
Au revoir, mes amis. 
I have to kinda tell you something that you have to promise you kind of definitely won't tell Caroline. 
Are you about to tell me that when she speaks French it makes you want to slam your head through that plate-glass window too? 
Heh. Well, the thing is 
he's married. 
He's married? 
How do you know? 
He's not wearing a ring, and he doesn't seem dead inside. 
 His wife called him after you guys left. 
 How could he do that? 
 He's French? 
 And not tell Caroline. 
 He's French? 
 What a jerk. 
Fronch? 
I'm telling her right now. 
Wait, wait, wait, Max, do me a favor...? 
Can you just wait until after I turn in my croquembouche? 
I'm already on thin ice with "au bon pain in my ass." 
This sucks. 
He's married, and Caroline has this weird thing in her head that she has to marry someone who isn't married. 
Bonjour, Bebe. Ca va? 
Oh, boy. 
I'm not really good with any languages. 
They think it's because I got hit by three cars. 
FYI, if you ever get hit, just stay down. 
Well, guess what. 
I got you and me salads. 
Girls' lunch. 
Well, I usually just have peanut butter and crackers in the dark... 
I hear so much about salad I've always wanted to try it. 
Sure. Sit. Have some salad. 
You and me, me and you. 
Getting to know more about each other. 
So Bebe, tell me everything about Nicolas. 
He's the best. He has 
the heart and eyes of a dog. 
 So Nicolas, where do you think he is? 
 He just said he had a lunch date. 
Date? Did he use the word "date," or 
are you just using the word "date"? 
I mean, it's not like he's dating anyone. 
Is he? 
No, why would he be dating anyone? 
Exactly, why would he be dating anyone? 
Yeah, I mean, he's married. 
Married? 
You know, salad tastes just like lettuce. 
You are not going to believe this. 
Kendall Jenner is applying to colleges? 
Come on, Max, no. 
Nicolas is... and get ready... 
Married. 
I kissed a married man. 
I'm so mortified. 
Please don't ever tell anyone I kissed a married man. 
Okay, I won't tell anyone. 
 Tell anyone what? 
 Caroline kissed a married man. 
But don't tell anyone. 
All right, I want to go on the record that I didn't know. 
Kissing a married man has never been in my life plan. 
It's not on my vision board or in my dreamscape. 
I am not that kind of person. 
But she is the kind of person who has a vision board and says "dreamscape," so let's judge her on that. 
I won't judge you, Caroline. 
I once went out with a married woman. 
I didn't know she was married until her spouse came and beat me up. 
Lesbians are strong. 
Listen, married, not married, don't be so American. 
You know, in Poland, the wedding vows say, "Do you take this woman..." 
"And maybe some others?" 
Well, not Polish, and not a lesbian yet. 
So I'm very upset. 
And, Max, why are you just standing there? 
Why haven't you said anything? 
Um... 
I kind of knew. 
Wait. You kind of knew 
he was married? 
You kind of knew and didn't kind of tell me? 
 What kind of friend are you? 
 I just found out myself. 
Well, then why didn't you tell me? 
I was going to, but then Deke asked me not to until he handed in his homework. 
And also I thought you might cry. 
 Oh, and you didn't want to upset me? 
 Nah, I didn't want to deal with it. 
'Cause when you cry, you don't just cry once. It's like a six-cry thing. 
You've got the first shock cry, the silent cry, the ugly cry, the cry because you're crying, the cry after you say you're not gonna cry anymore, and then the final cry, which is probably my fault. 
Well, you're wrong, Max, I'm not gonna cry over this, because I haven't gone far enough down the road. 
Yes, I was just beginning to think about our future, but I'm not that invested. 
 Then what's this? 
 My dupe pad. 
That's right. And look what 
I found written on the back. 
"Caroline and Nicolas Saintcroix." 
"Mr. and Mrs. Saintcroix." 
"Caroline Saintcroix." 
That's just being silly. 
Every girl does that. 
You're 40. 
 Oh, man, this is heavy. 
 I know, very heavy. 
We're back here, and I have to deal with the fact that I was dry-humped by a married man. 
No, I think he meant his dessert is heavy. 
But yeah, you got a lot going on. 
So what do you want us to do? 
Should we throw down? 
Mess his ass up? 
Kick him in the face? 
Or just ignore it so I don't get kicked out of school? 
No, I'll deal with Nicolas later. 
You sure? 'Cause I've always 
wanted to kill a French person. 
Again. 
Thanks, but stay out of it. 
I've got this. 
I'm gonna rip him a new one. 
 Bonjour, Caroline. 
 Bonjour, Nicolas. 
That wasn't a rip. 
Wasn't even a tear. 
Go, go, you two. 
Got a big, hot bundt here. 
Go, go, don't be late. 
You sure that's a croquembouche? 
'Cause it looks like a coyote poop tree. 
Caroline, can you watch the phones for me while I give chef Nicolas this note from his wife? 
You know what? 
I'll give it to him. 
I have something I have to say to him anyway. 
Oh, for next girls' lunch, have you ever had sandwiches? 
'Cause I'm thinking of trying one. 
Not you. 
You have got this. 
You have got this. 
You broke up with a Kennedy cousin. 
You can do this. 
Caroline, do you need something? 
I just wanted to give you this phone message you just got. 
From your wife. 
From your wife... 
Juliette...? 
 I know her name. 
 You're married. 
Yes, you just got a message from my wife. 
I feel like something's getting lost in the translation here, so let me be clear. 
It's over between us. 
Why? 
Why? 
Because you're married. 
Again, I know that. 
But why? 
What... what do 
you mean "why"? 
Why? Because you are married. 
Vous est marie! 
And note, I did not use "tu" because we are back on the more formal "vous" terms. 
Look, Caroline, my wife is in France, and we have an understanding. 
Well, I'm having a hard time understanding any of this. 
And whatever arrangement you and Juliette have, it's over between you and me. 
Here. 
You are very cute when you're angry. 
I am? 
Actually, you are very cute all the time. Cute and sexy. 
From the moment I saw you, I wanted to... 
 Put my lips onto yours. 
 You did? 
Yes. 
Caroline, you are a smart, sexy, delicious woman. 
And now that I've kissed... 
Do you have something in your eye? 
No, no, no, no, no. 
It's never you! 
I'm sorry, what is happening? 
Chef Nicolas, uh, you need to get back in there because the chef with the neck tattoo is trying to pass off a store-bought tiramisu. 
There is one every year. 
Caroline. 
Are you okay? 
What did he say? 
He said he's married, and it's confusing, and I'm delicious. 
Okay, well, he's married, it's confusing, and you're delicious. 
So you're Mrs. Delicious Saintcroix. 
So it's over, right? 
Yeah, of course it's over. 
No drama, no more crying. 
 I would never be with a married man. 
 Yeah, that's more my thing. 
Oh, my God, Max, you know what I just realized? 
I once said I would never be a waitress. 
Girrrl... 
﻿1 All right, I closed out the cupcake register. 
Here is our rent money. 
Give me back the envelope, though, 'cause it's also my jewelry box. 
No, I closed out the register. 
I have our rent money. 
Max, do you know what this means? 
Unless I was hit in the head by a piece of farm equipment, it means we have extra money. 
I wanna do the extra money dance, but we don't have one because we've never had extra money! 
The only extra money dance I know involves ping-pong balls and I'm really out of practice. 
(Peter Bjorn and John)  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Earl, I brought you your favorite. 
A half-black, half-Chinese belly dancer? 
A coconut cupcake. 
Look at Caroline over there. 
She's flirting harder with him than I flirt with heart disease. 
Stop, stop! I'm only 
on episode two of season one. 
I will kill you! 
Then... 
To be continued. 
Oh! It's gonna be continued... 
Well, then, we will continue this... 
When we continue this. 
If that's your game, you're gonna be living with me forever, Fran. 
He's been in my section three nights in a row for the Turkey Club. 
I'm calling him "the Turkey Club cutie". 
I'm calling poison control. 
I think he's getting ready to ask me out. 
He wanted to know if I live around here and what time I get off. 
If a man's gonna wait for you to get off, he's a keeper. 
So... 
See you next time. 
I will see you next time as well. 
Bye. 
 What's that? 
 I don't know. How would I know? 
Because it came out of your head...? 
I don't have hair extensions, Max. 
 Okay, I'll throw it out. 
 No! I'll keep it for this story! 
What story? 
The story about how we found a blonde hair extension out of nowhere that night. 
It's hilarious! 
Well, it's already funnier than most of your stories. 
Oh, look, there's another hilarious story! 
Okay, Max, I have a confession to make. 
I have hair extensions. 
I also have a confession to make. 
I murdered a man in Rhode Island. 
I just have a few. 
It gives me volume. 
Too bad it doesn't give you depth. 
Now I have to go and try and reattach these. 
These weaves are supposed to last. 
This is unbe-weave-able! 
I found this in the lettuce. 
Any sign of a NuvaRing in there? 
'Cause I can't find mine. 
Caroline's losing her hair, isn't she? 
Is she sick? 
Does she have cancer, The Big "C"? 
No, Little You. 
She doesn't have The Big "C". 
She barely has the double "A's". 
 Han found more of your hair. 
 He knows about the extensions? 
No, he thinks you have cancer. 
Oh, good! 
So no one knows. 
Hola, ladies! 
Your night just got sexier. 
Luis, you punched out hours ago. 
What are you doing here so late? 
On your way homo? 
Good one, hooker! 
No, I'm between clubs. 
Circus just became a straight club, and Satellite doesn't become a gay club for a half hour. 
So... I'm here to have a cocktail 
with my bro Oleg. 
Luis, we told you. 
Oleg is straight. 
Oh, please! 
So am I in Alabama. 
Well, he left already. 
But I told him I was gonna stop by. 
Typical man. Fear of intimacy. 
Oh, Carolina, while I'm here... 
This is yours. 
I found it during my shift. 
 Ooh, tips from my tables? 
 More like hair from your head. 
I knew this was all too good to be true. 
You have extensions. 
No, I have cancer. 
No, you have extensions. 
Good try. Later! 
Hey. 
Notice anything different? 
I took some of the extra money and got new hair extensions. 
And I also got you a surprise. 
I put it in your room. Go look! 
I'm not interested unless it's a potbelly pig or a potbelly pig in a pilgrim costume, or a pilgrim in a potbelly pig costume, or just pot. 
Hint, hint. I put it on your bed. 
What do you think? Do you love? 
Okay... 
Why is all this crap on my bed? 
 And what the hell is it? 
 That's a bed skirt. 
My bed doesn't wear skirts. 
It's a dude! 
I know, because it pokes me in the back while I'm asleep. 
I got you new bedding, and me some cute new flannel jammies. 
They have Eiffel Towers on them. 
They were marked down because everybody hates French people. 
These don't even have stains! 
How am I gonna know which is the top now? 
Max, what's the problem? 
You've had those old sheets forever. 
 You don't even have a spare set. 
 A spare set of sheets? 
Who am I, the Queen of England? 
You're so frustrating, I'd pull my hair out... 
But I'm not sure which of it is mine. 
Look! Look! 
Are you happy? 
Chestnut's upset. 
He knows we're fighting. 
Good! He should know that if 
he goes out for a bag of chips, he could come home to find you replaced his saddle with a thong. 
I got you a present. 
Would you be this angry at Santa Claus? 
Who's that? 
Max, please. Just for a change, 
try sleeping on something nice. 
Fine! 
But if I wanted to sleep on something nice, I would have hooked up with that guy who moved home to take care of his sick mother. 
Watch your back, Chestnut. 
Watch your back. 
Where are my old sheets, bitch? 
Why? 
Why are you calling me a "bitch" at night? 
I was sleeping in my new jammies. 
Well, I can't sleep without those sheets. 
So where are they? 
I checked all your drawers. 
And by the way, who hides their vibrator in a Starbucks cup? 
You already know the answer, so I'm going back to sleep. 
Whoa, whoa! 
Why! 
Why am I on the floor in my new jammies? 
Where are they? 
I don't have them. 
I gave them to the poor. 
You took them from the poor! 
And the poor wants them back. 
Well, it's too late. I put them 
in the Salvation Army donation bin. 
Well, get up. 
You're going to the army, bitch. 
Whyyyy? 
Why are we here in the middle of the night? 
What are we doing? 
Here it is. 
Come on, follow me. 
Max, is this where you kill me? 
'Cause I always knew it was gonna happen, I just didn't know when. 
This feels right though. 
I should kill you. 
Those sheets were really special to me, okay? 
Oh, did you lose your virginities on them? 
I don't have sex in beds. 
That's where I eat. 
Caroline, I have a confession. 
 What is it? 
 You have hair extensions. 
Okay, I'll tell you, but look away. 
It's the pillowcase. 
I've had it since I was a kid. 
It's like soft and nubby and it had this edge that I'd like... rub, 
and it relaxed me when things were crappy, which was all the time. 
I guess I still need that pillowcase to sleep, or whatever. 
 Max, that's so sad. 
 Of course it's sad! 
When has it ever been a happy tale? 
All right, I need to crawl in here. 
Max, y'reouust gonna crawl into that dirty box? 
We don't know where that bin's been. 
By the way, "dirty box" was my nickname in continuation school. 
I need help. Would you rather 
I step on your back or your head? 
My head? Hardly. 
Not at these prices. 
 Come on, gimme ten fingers. 
 I already did. 
Behind your back while we were walking here. 
No, like this, so I can step into it. 
 You know, like a finger basket. 
 Finger basket...? 
Is that another nickname of yours? 
No, but for one summer, it could've been. 
Forget this, just let me pull this stuff over. 
Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww. 
Max, I feel like we're not even acknowledging our low points anymore. 
Okay, Max, now be very careful. 
And on the count of... 
Wow! You could've been 
a great gymnast, if you'd had money, coaches, and a breast reduction. 
Are you okay? 
Max? 
Gonna need some voice contact. 
I'm not in here alone. 
What do you mean you're not alone? 
I'm not in here alone. 
Stay calm! 
I will get you out of there. 
No, I won't. 
I'm looking for a lever on the inside. 
Get outta my house! 
OK, I just wanna check and see if you're on my pillowcase. 
Max, no! 
I need my sweet sheets! 
Let it go. If your sheets are under 
there, they're no long sweet. 
Get outta my house! 
And close the door! 
Okay! Okay! 
God, Sheez. 
You'd think we'd slept together. 
What am I gonna do? 
I can't sleep without those sheets! 
I'm so angry at you! 
I'd be even angrier if I hadn't found this great bra. 
Why are you going to Sophie's if you're trying to sleep? 
She's the loudest person we know. 
Even black people at the movies tell Sophie to be quiet. 
I am going to Sophie's to get a sleeping pill. 
Or as she likes to call them, "night candy". 
You don't need a pill. 
Listen, I have a great sleep technique that my sleep coach taught me. 
I have slept with my fair share of coaches, and if anything, they kept me awake. 
Max, it's 3:00 A.M. 
Any normal person is sleeping right now. 
Hi, girls. 
Just doing a puzzle and listening to Elvis. 
You two want a Mai Tai before you get too Ty-Ty? 
No, thanks, but speaking of Ty-Ty, I was hoping I could snag one of your sleeping pills. 
Oh, sure, I can hook you up. 
I never use them. 
I only need three hours of sleep at night and six during the day. 
Come on. 
Sophie... 
Notice anything new? 
Oh! Yeah! 
You planted more hair on your head. 
I heard. 
Max! You told her? 
No, it was on CNN. 
They led with Syria, and then did a solid five on your hair. 
Here we go... 
Pills and spices! 
You have a spice rack full of pills? 
You gotta cook me dinner sometime. 
Let's see. 
Fish oil, penicillin, amoxicillin... 
Skittles. 
Oh, and this is my German pill in case they release the bombs or I'm ever abandoned in space. 
Here you go, Max. 
Nighty-night. 
Oh, you know what? 
What the hell! 
I'm gonna have one two. 
It's a slumber party! 
Uh-oh. 
Oh, now you got another rack full of pills. 
Oh, you know what? 
Don't wait for me, Max. 
This might be a while. 
Max, do you really need to take that? 
People do weird things on sleeping pills. 
My friend Candice Travelstead buttered a wallet and tried to eat it. 
Don't worry, I don't have a wallet. 
Wait a minute! 
Wait a minute. 
Is that the sleeping pill, or is that my emergency space pill that kills you? 
Either way, I'll get some shut-eye. 
Max, no! You are not gonna die 
and leave me here alone. 
I still don't know how to go East on the "L" train without a chaperone. 
Max, it's 3:30 A.M., 
and sleep coach Caroline here will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest. 
You're supposed to be taking a hot bath. 
I was, but when I put the stopper in, something pushed it back out again. 
Where's that pill? 
I've got it on my person, and if this doesn't work I'll give it to you. 
Oh, I'll go elbow-deep for that pill. 
And don't think I won't. 
Max, meet your new sheets. 
New sheets, meet... 
Don't make me meet the sheets. 
I'm not a mental patient. 
If I was, I'd be living in a much nicer place. 
And all my pillowcases would have edges. 
Wow, even your pillowcase had an edge. 
What was it like anyway? 
It was kinda like the end of your new PJ's, but not the queerest thing I've ever seen. 
A candle? 
What are we, witches? 
Now, imagine yourself in a relaxed, beautiful place. 
Breathe in and out. 
In and out. 
Look, if there's one thing old finger basket know how to do it's in and out. 
 Gimme the pill. 
 I'm not finished yet. 
But just so you know, that pill has changed colors three times in the last hour. 
So it's either deadly, or an everlasting gobstopper. 
I am so mad at you. 
You took my one thing. 
That pillowcase was my one special thing. 
In my whole life of people taking things away from me, that was the one thing no one took, and now I'm never gonna sleep again. 
And I love sleeping. 
Dreaming is the closest thing I have to cable TV. 
Enough, Max! 
I've been very patient with this weird attachment you have to this little piece of sheet. 
You're a piece of sheet. 
Listen, if I learned anything when I lost everything, it's that, "A," there's no wiggle room when it comes to cottage cheese expiration dates, and "B," you can't get attached to material things. 
Oh! Okay, Extensions. 
What does that mean? 
It means that your material things are literally attached to your head. 
Not the same thing at all. 
Your dependency on that pillowcase is all in your head, you don't need it. 
Oh. You don't need this. 
You owe me $14. Ah! 
Run a tab. 
I'm not about to sit here and take this abuse because you have an unhealthy attachment to a pillowcase. 
Good night, Malibu Barbie. 
I hope you're not trying to insult me, because she's gorgeous! 
And for the record, I do not have an unhealthy attachment to my hair. 
Oh, really...? 
You're a monster! 
I'm sorry, I can't sleep. 
 I'll be fine. Just give me the pill. 
 No! It's all in your head! 
Go to sleep! 
I tied the doorknob to my bed with a rope and locked all the bedroom windows. 
Are you trying to hurt me or turn me on? 
Brace yourself, Earl. 
When Max gets here, she will not be in a good mood. 
Caroline, if I wanted to work around people in a good mood, I'd go work at Google. 
She hasn't slept since yesterday and is furious because I won't give her a sleeping pill. 
Smart move. Sleeping pills mess you up. 
I took one once, woke up a day later on the roller coaster ride in Coney Island. 
I love roller coasters. 
Me too, when I'm in a seat. 
Oh, hello! 
How are you two tonight? 
Oh, no. She's nice. 
She must've gotten a pill somewhere. 
No. No pills. 
Just had some clarity. 
Follow me, please. 
Oh, okay. Did you smoke 
or snort this clarity? 
Now, since you were nice enough to get me new sheets, I got you something in return. 
Here. 
Oh, is this like an apology, thank you kind of thing? 
Now watch. This is how 
one graciously accepts a gift. 
What the hell is this? 
A wig? 
Either that or you scalped a lesbian from the '80s. 
Yep, I grabbed her bolo tie and climbed up on her shoulder pads. 
You took away my security thing... 
The pillowcase... 
So now I'm taking away your security thing... your hair. 
You can wear that on your head tonight and then tell me again how this is all in my head. 
Did you have to get the ugliest one they had? 
What do you want for 37 cents? 
Fine! I'll put this roadkill 
on my head just to prove to you that I am so much more than my hair. 
I am my attitude, my spirit, my brain, my bravery. 
 Put it on. 
 Max, I'm scared. 
Go. 
The bangs go in the back. 
That's my kinda woman. 
Cobb salad, pick-up! 
Uh... hey, Sophie. 
Are you here for the mafia widow discount? 
Earl, I'm incognito. 
I'm making a drug drop for Max. 
Hey, Max! 
I got your drugs! 
Thanks. 
And I love that you have an outfit for everything I ask you to do. 
Where's the blonde narc, Max? 
Oh, my God! 
Did Caroline join a bowling team? 
Max! No! 
Aw, crap! Rod Stewart 
just busted us. 
Let her have some fun. 
What's the big deal, square? 
The big deal is that Max thinks she needs these pills because I threw away her blankie. 
It was a pillowcase, and I need it to sleep. 
She has to rub it. 
In Poland, I had this little thing that I liked to tickle before I went to sleep. 
But my aunt threw it away. 
What was it? 
My cousin Nora. 
Give me the pills. 
Nope. And, Max, you were wrong. 
See? I'm not attached to my hair. 
In fact, I am loving my new look. 
Am I a single mom trying to keep it simple? 
Am I an assistant D.A. 
in over my head? 
Or am I Charlize Theron in The Jon Bon Jovi Story? 
Maybe, and I'm fine with it. 
'Cause I am not my hair. 
Oh, my God, Turkey Club cutie! 
Hide me! 
On your knees in a bad wig. 
Listen, girl, I've been there. 
No, I just don't wanna be seen. 
Caroline, Caroline, I love you, but I can't hear anymore. 
That hair was hard enough to look at in the '70s. 
Fine! You were right, 
I was wrong. 
Now help me get this off. 
He can't see me like this. 
That's right, gimme the pills. 
Max, no. You don't need them. 
We don't know where they've been. 
Fine! 
I'm going home to try to sleep. 
Since this is all your fault, you can finish my shift. 
You're on your own, lady who lived across the street from Al Bundy. 
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed I can do this. 
It's not so hard. I don't know what 
Chanice is always bitching about. 
I guess that's who she is. 
I can't believe I still haven't slept. 
I'm gonna be awake forever. 
It's gonna be like that movie Awakenings, but not at all. 
Max, you can rub me. 
Wow, that wig changed you. 
No, here. 
Rub the edge on the bottom of my jammie top like it's your pillowcase. 
No. If I rub the bottom of your 
jammies, that would be my bottom. 
Turkey Club cutie didn't ask me out, probably because my hair was so messed up from the wig. 
Don't be so hard on yourself. 
It could've been your personality too. 
You really think he only liked you for your hair? 
I only like me for my hair. 
 Told you. You're attached to it. 
 So attached to it! 
Twirling it, tossing it, flipping it. 
Feeling it on my neck, on my shoulders, on my back. 
Caroline Channing without the option of a sleek updo is not Caroline Channing. 
And I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry I judged you for having an attachment to something when I'm no better. 
And I'm sorry I got rid of your sweet sheets. 
Max. 
Max...? 
Night, Max. 
Whyyyy? 
Why can't I ever have anything nice? 
﻿1 Your waitress just went on break, and I'm just someone who likes dressing like a polyester hot dog, so I'll take that whenever you're ready. 
There you go. 
No rush. 
Okay, Mr. Rajeev Guttikonda. 
I have to say, that's a pretty Gutti scheme you got going there, but I Guttikonda don't believe it. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you saying there? 
What am I saying there, Boston? 
I'm saying I believe you watched Slumdog Millionaire on a sticky couch in your mom's basement, but I'm not buying that you're Indian. 
So take your fake, East Boston, Indian accent out of here, or I'll call the cops. 
Dude, stolen credit card, and you choose to eat here? 
That's the real crime. 
Hey, Rajeev. 
Rajeev, my man. 
Rajeev Gudikanda. 
You know what? 
This one's on me. 
I have trust issues. 
(Peter Bjorn and John)  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Season 3, Episode 5 "And the Cronuts" That's weird. We still have 
three Red Velvets left. 
I guess that bulimic girl didn't come in today. 
No, she's here. 
She's in the bathroom. 
Hmm, if I save these for her, would that be helping or hurting? 
Hey, everybody. 
Speaking of hurting, here comes a pain in my ass. 
Han, do you want the last Red Velvet? 
The other two are for the bulimic girl. 
I made the call. 
No more cupcakes for me. I've been 
on a juice cleanse for six days. 
Han's on the prowl, and I got to keep this body tight, son. 
I'm in the dating pool, you know. 
Yeah, the shallow end. 
You know those cleanses never work, right? 
Really? 
Then how do you explain this? 
I don't know. Am I supposed 
to rub it and make a wish? 
Not bad for having three kids, Han. 
What? You don't see 
my abs coming in? 
I see one large ab coming in. 
That's at least a two-pack. 
Han, the real Tupac is more alive than your two-pack. 
I'm gonna give this last cupcake away as a free sample. 
My promotional tweets haven't been getting much love lately. 
What'd you say? I black out 
whenever you use work words. 
All I said was "promotional tweets" and "sample." 
What? 
Here you go, ladies, a Max's homemade cupcake on the house. 
Nah, I'm cool. 
I'm saving my calories for one of those fabulous new cronuts. 
Plus, cupcakes are so over. 
Well, so is blossom, but... 
It didn't stop you from wearing that outfit. 
 Those flower power skanks over there... 
 "Flower Power skanks." 
See, these are words I recognize and hear. 
Anyway, she said she only cares about cronuts and that cupcakes are over. 
 Cupcakes are classic, right? 
 Don't listen to them. 
They're wearing high-waisted jeans. 
The only time I like seeing women's jeans that high is when I'm giving Han a wedgie. 
Also, what's a cronut? 
Cronut is what we called my Croatian cousin with one testicle. 
He hung himself. 
Okay, well, in America, it's a half-croissant, half-doughnut. 
They're on the news, Twitter, Instagram. 
People can't stop talking about them. 
If cronuts had tongues, they'd be the Miley Cyrus of pastries. 
You're right. 
They sound stupid. 
Stupid delicious. 
Where can I get one? 
You can only get them at this one pastry shop in Soho, and people start lining up at 4:00 a.m. 
Boy, times do change. 
Back in the day, 4:00 a.m. 
was when people would snort lines, not stand in 'em. 
Who has the time to wait in line all day for a piece of lame pastry? 
Hey, everyone. 
I got a cronut. 
I waited in line for two whole days. 
Sophie, you bought into the hype too? 
Oh, come on, you know your girl Sophie is always on trend. 
I was the first one wearing crocs. 
I brought the crocs craze to America. 
When I was rich, I sent 10,000 pairs of crocs to children in Africa. 
Why, to make them less cool? 
Look, girls, here I am in the cronut line. 
And here I am still in line. 
Oh, and... oh, and here I am 
riding a baby elephant. 
And here I am eating a cronut. 
Max, as stupid as it is, we've got to go over there. 
We need to figure out what they have that we don't. 
Oh, I'll tell you what they have. 
Cronuts. 
Oh, my god. 
Look at this line. 
I knew we should have gotten here sooner, but, no, I had to be a good person, I had to carry that torso man on the skateboard up the subway stairs. 
All this is for a croissant and a doughnut? 
Those things already existed. 
Where was all the fanfare when I combined the sleeping pill with the morning after pill and called it the "sleepthrough the-morning-after" pill? 
How did these things get so popular? 
There's no science to this trend stuff. 
It's all decided by one bitchy gay guy typing in his room, making it all up. 
Well, then we have to do some trend research. 
We've got to figure out how to make Max's homemade cupcakes the next cronuts. 
I hate all these stupid trends. 
Cleanses, cronuts, condoms... 
Excuse me, sir, My name's Caroline. 
I'm a trend researcher. 
I'm Chuck. 
I sell magnets. 
What made you want to spend an entire day in line for cronuts? 
I like croissants. 
I like doughnuts. 
I'm a fat guy. 
It all adds up. 
That's true. 
You are a fat guy. 
And there's a doughnut shop right across the street. 
So why don't you just stop there, get a damn doughnut, and save yourself the last 200 possibly life-threatening steps to here? 
Look, it's two things I like put together. 
End of story. 
That's it, Max. 
It's the two things together. 
One thing isn't enough anymore. 
Yeah, that's why Oleg’s cousin hung himself. 
I'm serious. 
When's the last time you did just one thing? 
Like, watch a movie without playing a game on your phone? 
Magic Mike. 
Wait, does playing with yourself count? 
Come on, let's get to the end of the line. 
End of the line...? 
That's for rookies. 
I'm a line pro. 
My mom and I waited in line for food stamps, Bob Seger lawn seats... 
We spent a Saturday in the "guns for cash" line. 
Now that's a line you don't want to cut in. 
Follow my lead. 
Hey, man, cronut line. 
What do you want to do after this? 
Okay, all right, all right. 
Back of the line. 
Everybody relax. 
Guess my mom being topless had more to do with my line skills than I thought. 
Oh, great. 
Look at the cronut line. 
I told you we should have left sooner, but, no, you said we had to stay at temple. 
You're the rabbi. 
Yeah, a career I was forced into because someone wanted to write his memoir. 
We get it, Garry. 
You're adopted. 
Move up, hon. 
You gotta fill the gap. 
I would if you would stop trying to fill my gap. 
What difference does it make? 
You're still gonna have the same amount of time to wait. 
And then, in 30 years, we're all gonna die from Wi-Fi cancer. 
Okay, let's all just take a breath. 
It looks like we're gonna be here for a while. 
You know what? You're right. 
Hi, I'm Jerri. 
 And I'm Garry. 
 I'm Jerri, he's Garry. 
I'm tall, he's small. 
Cute, right? 
That's our thing. 
I'm Caroline, and this is Max. 
That's it. 
We don't have a thing. 
 So what drew you here today? 
 Oh, well, we're trendchasers. 
When something new hits, we are on it  ...like sea salt on dark chocolate. 
 Hmm. 
We did pinkberry, dippin' dots, kale, quinoa, Kombucha... 
All the ka's. 
Just 'cause. 
Can you tell we don't have kids? 
 She couldn't. 
 Garry! 
Actually, it's true, and you can read all about it in his memoir. 
It's called... 
You know what? Jerri, Garry. 
I think we got too close too soon. 
Maybe we need a little space. 
We got to move up in line to get away from these people. 
Should I just take my top off? 
 Next in line. 
 It happened! 
 We made it to the front of the line! 
 We're the front people! 
Yeah, we're the front people! 
Back people suck! 
No, no, I said "back people," "back people." 
Baruch Hashem. 
We loved The Butler. 
You know, we've been through a lot. 
Tempers flared, things were said. 
I'm fairly certain that Dutch guy back there died. 
But we made it, and you guys are good people. 
The sea salt of the earth. 
 Who's next? 
 We are. 
I can only take a party of two. 
Are all four of you together? 
 Nope. 
 We don't know them. 
 Guys...? 
 Cut 'em loose, Gar. 
All sold out. 
We're closed. 
I know you're driven mad with the power of being a doorman at a bakery, but come on! 
Max, you know what I want more than anything? 
To kill Jerri and Garry? 
'Cause I'm totally on board. 
No, I want our business to have a line. 
I want to sell out. 
I want people to turn against each other for our product. 
Again, I could just take my top off. 
I know, and thank you. 
We have that in our back pocket. 
But I have an idea we can try first. 
I'm gonna use work words now, so listen up, skank. 
I'm listening. 
I read in The Wall Street Journal that there's a whole black market for cronuts on Craigslist. 
Craigslist? Oh, no. 
I don't want one bad enough to let some guy lick my armpit for an hour again. 
They're not for us. 
We'll sell them at our window, just to attract attention, and then, when they sell out, we'll effortlessly switch to cupcakes. 
Classic bake and switch. 
All that work for some stupid fad? 
I said "fad." 
We loved "Behind the Candelabra". 
Try texting him again. 
He's 15 minutes late. 
You're really surprised that a guy reselling pastries in the "Rants and Raves" section of Craigslist isn't the punctual type? 
This is so exciting. 
I've never bought anything on the black market before. 
I'm still afraid to go to that Filipino market around the corner. 
Are you the guy? 
I don't know. 
Are you the girl? 
So far, this musical sucks. 
 What's the password? 
 Cronut. 
Was "1234" already taken? 
Meet us by the door. 
Which is code for, "Meet us by the door." 
Which is code for, "You're really bad at code." 
Okay, let's talk about our plan. 
It's a classic good cop/bad cop. 
I'm gonna ask the guy for ten cronuts, and he's gonna quote me 250. 
Right, then I play bad cop and act outraged. 
And then I play good cop, and we settle at 200. 
Yeah, and don't worry about me. 
I'll improve some good stuff on the spot. 
Are you sure you don't want to run it by me first? 
I was in an improve group at Wharton. 
We were called "The fun percent." 
And I can imagine myself not laughing with 99% of the audience. 
Let's make it quick. 
You're not the only girls in town who want my nuts! 
I assume you mean cronuts. 
No, I'm also a male prostitute. 
Let's see the product. 
She meant the other baked goods. 
You got to be clear. 
Pretty maids, all in a row. 
Let mama get a taste. 
That's pure. 
How much for ten? 
I know I said 250 earlier, but... 
Bullcrap! 
150 or we walk, bitch! 
Okay, let's all just calm down. 
It's a really good deal, Max. 
How about we settle at 200 and call it a night? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
About that. 
I be getting mad offers for these things tonight. 
I actually got to raise it to 300, or I walk. 
Bitch. 
Ooh, ow, ow, ooh, your hands are cold. 
What'd you call me? 
 Nothing. 
 That's what I thought. 
She said 200. We'll pay 200. 
And you'll take it. 
You'll shove it in this hanes her way hoodie you're wearing, you'll say, "Thank you, Max" and you'll hit the bricks, capisce? 
Caroline, cash. 
 Thank you, Max. 
 What'd you say? 
Thank you, Max! 
I've got the chills now. 
Do you guys serve tea? 
How's that for bad cop? 
Riveting. I felt like I was watching 
Bakery edition. 
Okay, here we go. 
This is the last one. 
You want this cronut? 
Lift up your shirt and let me see 'em. 
Go get Han. I want to show him 
what an ab is. 
Max, you should see the line. 
It's halfway down the block. 
 We have a line. It's working. 
 But what's gonna happen now? 
I worked at Target the Christmas, they ran out of Tickle me Elmo, and... there was so much blood. 
As planned, we'll just calmly switch to our delicious cupcakes, and then those'll sell out too because they're that good. 
Okay. 
Attention, everyone. 
Everyone, can I have your attention? 
Actually, we are very sorry, but we are now sold out of cronuts. 
We do, however, have something even better... 
Max's homemade cupcakes. 
All right, go! 
Leave. 
Chase your stupid trends. 
But we're not worried! 
Cupcakes are classic! 
We're Audrey Hepburn! 
Max, cupcakes are over. 
And you know why? Because 
cupcakes are just one thing. 
If we had two things, then we'd be something. 
That does it. 
I'm calling the dealer. 
I don't think we should order more cronuts. 
Oh, no, I mean my drug dealer. 
I need to take the edge off. 
This sucks. I feel worse about myself 
than I did when I dropped the torso man. 
 What are you doing with those fries? 
 I'm dipping 'em in frosting. 
I do it when I'm depressed. 
I went right from baby food into fries in frosting. 
Is it good? 
It looks disgusting. 
It is both. 
Just taste it. 
These are pretty good. 
Sweet and salty. 
Cupcakes and fries. 
That's two things. 
Cake fries. 
We're millionaires. 
My willingness to eat anything finally pays off! 
Wait, are you sure it's not just us being desperate? 
Like, when Adam Levine made that music video in Brooklyn and you walked past the set all day in a wet tank top? 
It can't hurt to put them out there. 
That's what you said that day too. 
 Just sit down for a second, Han. 
 But this is the middle of a shift. 
I'm gonna tell everyone you're in the middle of a male-to-female shift if you don't sit down. 
All right. 
You are here tonight to taste the next big thing. 
Okay, now you're just repeating my pick-up lines back to me. 
No, it's a new dessert, and we've assembled the perfect focus group... 
A black man, a pig, and a health fanatic. 
Y'all know who you are. 
I suppose I have been trying to eat better lately. 
Hey, extra, extra! 
Read all about it! 
I'm bisexual now! 
Oh, perfect, now we have the LGBTQ community represented. 
 What's the "Q"? 
 Questioning. 
And answered. 
Hey, everybody. 
Meet Veronica. 
She's cute, she's black, she has short blonde hair, she's exciting. 
 And we met in Soul Cycle class. 
 Yes, we did. 
I slipped in her sweat and she bought me a Luna bar. 
Now? 
Now you're bisexual? 
Well, yeah, you got to keep up with the trends. 
Okay, focus group. 
Let's focus. 
This is our new product, called Cake Fries. 
Cute, right? 
You just take a fry from the left side, dip it into the cupcake frosting on the right, and enjoy your sweet, yet savory dessert. 
Is this woman seriously trying to teach me how to eat food? 
Oh, no, this looks very fattening, and I've been on a fast. 
 One lick isn't going to kill you. 
 Yeah, just ask Sophie. 
Okay, one bite. 
Now I don't want any of you to hold back. 
Be completely honest in your criticism. 
 Well, I feel like... 
 Shut up, Han. 
No, I was gonna say this is very good. 
Too good. 
Uh-oh, look away, girls. 
You've released the Kraken. 
Damn. 
That is tasty. 
Now you may have given me diabetes, as I have just lost the feeling in my left foot. 
You know what, I think I might be trisexual, because I'm having a love affair with these cake fries. 
Oh, my gosh, this is gross. 
And it's very messy. 
Oh, come on, then what was earlier? 
Okay, everyone, this is all very helpful. 
We're still working some things out. 
Uh-oh. 
My tummy feels funny. 
You mean your ab is hurting? 
Han, your first food in a week probably shouldn't have been a fistful of fries and frosting. 
You know what, guys? 
We've all worked hard today. 
 Let's call it a night. 
 But it's only 9:00. 
Pardon me. Excuse me. 
Uh-oh. You don't want 
to see that... 
Look out! 
Move it. 
Move it or lose it. 
Move it or I lose it. 
Out of way, out of my way now! 
Oh, dear... 
This is more embarrassing than when Han fell asleep and Oleg drew a penis on his face. 
I traced that penis on his face. 
Now you dip the fries in the frosting, but I find the best way to eat this is to first make sure you feel super empty inside. 
Not gonna be a problem. 
These are adorable. 
Could you please take a picture of me with it? 
It's so cute. 
And make sure you hashtag that picture "Max's homemade cake fries" when you post it online. 
A sad girl smiling with our cake fries. 
Once that hits iVillage, we'll be knee-deep in canvas totes and cankles. 
Here you go! 
Sorry, that was our last cake fries. 
We'll have more tomorrow. 
 Wait. We sold out? 
 We sold out! 
Oh, my god! 
We sold out! 
Yes! I'm a sell-out! 
Let's buy a helicopter! 
Hi, girls. 
Oh, hey, Sophie. We're sorry, 
but we just ran out of cake fries. 
Oh, that's fine by me. 
I'm going back to the basics. 
Cupcakes and penis. 
Here's your cupcake. 
We don't sell the other basic. 
Mm... 
You know, it's nice to eat something you don't have to compliment every five minutes. 
You know what, Max? 
Cupcakes, cronuts, cake fries, whatever. 
We're gonna be successful because we have the two things that really matter... 
You and me. 
We're kinda like cake fries. 
I mean, salty and sweet. 
 I'm sweet... 
 And I've been assaulted. 
﻿1 Max, your boyfriend is naked and waving from the dumpster he calls his apartment. 
Make sure it's Deke. 
Last time you said that, I went over, and it was just a naked meth head in a normal dumpster. 
I mean, we had a blast, but still. 
Well, at least that meth head bought a bunch of cupcakes. 
I mean, he thought they were alive, but he bought them. 
 Hey, I'm gonna cut out early. 
 You're sleeping over again? 
Seriously, Max, sleeping in a dumpster? 
Are you trying to bring SARS back? 
Well, I did bring it in the first time, and that is the last time I hook up with a bat in Thailand. 
Hey, Max. 
Season 3, Episode 15 "And The Icing On The Cake" Max is 45 minutes late. 
And she better not say she have a prostate exam 'cause I'm not falling for that again. 
Relax, she's just down the street at Deke's place. 
You know how it is when you first start sleeping with somebody, and you can't keep your hands off each other... 
Yeah, just take my word for it. 
I know I couldn't keep my hands off my first love. 
I'm talking, of course, about my penis. 
I've had enough! 
You two girls walk all over me. 
A baby can walk all over you. 
Hi, everybody. 
Oh, I just heard two hobos getting freaky in the garbage. 
Sophie, that was Max and Deke. 
Oh, I get it. 
You gotta do crazy things to keep it fresh. 
You know, I once had sex on a bus, and I was driving it. 
Boy, were those kids late to school. 
That's it, I am marching over there and putting my foot down with Max. 
No one has sex on my clock. 
Well, maybe your clock's not big enough. 
That's it. 
No more free jell-o. 
Max! 
Max, open up. 
I'm very upset. 
More upset than that time you enrolled me in Little League. 
Hey, it was your decision to play the full season. 
Oh, goody, I was hoping for some hecklers at this, my lowest moment. 
Hey, if the dumpster's rockin', don't bother knockin', baby. 
Hey, man. 
Hello, little girl. 
I'll take three boxes of Samoas and a thin mints. 
Don't forget my tagalongs. 
They're called peanut butter patties now. 
Why must I be that person? 
 What up, fools? 
 Hey, girl. 
Max, you're 48 minutes late for work. 
Look, little Debbie, we're in here preparing for a big pastry school competition tomorrow. 
And having sex. 
And if you ever interrupt me while I am studying... 
And having sex. 
Again, I will dropkick your baby-powdered ass back to the Shire with the other hobbits. 
I told her. 
Did you? 
All flowers must be set on top of the cakes by the time we call "time." 
Everyone, final touches. 
That's what I used to say when I finished my shift at Hooters. 
Hot. You still got 
that uniform? 
Oh, not sure it'd fit me anymore. 
I used to have really big boobs. 
Bebe, how much time is there left? 
For all of us? 
Oh, oh, gosh, I'd say two months, tops. 
No, no, for the cake competition. 
 Oh, 60 seconds. 
 Only 60 seconds? Come on! 
I'm sorry, I can't handle this pressure. 
It's only a matter of time before I start eating my eyelashes again. 
The winning team will earn a free week of class. 
And also... how do you say... 
Bragging rights. 
Hurry! Move 
faster, Lindsay Slow-Hands. 
Forget about it, Big Mary. 
These competition is ours. 
Deke and I are broke. 
We need this more than you. 
15 seconds! 
Oh, bonjour, Caroline. 
This is a real treat. 
Mm-mm, uh-uh, don't do that. 
You're married. 
I'm only here in an official capacity. 
Bebe's in an emotional ball in the hall. 
 Ten seconds! 
 Come on, girl. 
Bring it home, bring it home, bring it home, bring it home! 
I am way too excited about this. 
Okay, everybody. 
I see a clear favorite here. 
But, Caroline, in truth, if I were to pick the prettiest flower in the room, I'd pick you. 
That is... Incredibly obvious 
and incredibly accurate. 
Oh, come on! 
Get a stairwell! 
 Your timer. 
 Merci. 
Just tell us who won. 
The winners are, I am very happy to say... 
Max and Deke. 
You were amazing! 
I love you. 
I love you too. 
Wait, you do? 
Do you...? 
Yeah... I do. 
Yeah, well, I do too, so suck on that. 
Okay, two important things. 
One, I'm the guy you've been talking to on OK-Cupid. 
And two, I need five minutes of girl talk and not a minute more because I'm worried it'll turn me into a girl. 
Go. Tell me. Leave nothing out, 
leave everything in. 
I said something today I never thought I'd say. 
"Thank you"? 
I said "I love you" to Deke. 
He said, "I love you," and I said it back. 
Oh, cool. 
Good for you. 
Wait, that's it? 
I finally decide to cave and be a girl for you, and you hang me out to dry? 
I've seen movies. You're supposed 
to jump around and say, "This calls for a Margarita!" 
This calls for a Margarita! 
Too much, too late. 
Your first reaction said everything, and your second one was just annoying. 
I'm sorry, I just didn't think you were taking him so seriously. 
He has no money. I mean, 
the man lives in a dumpster. 
You are such a snob. 
It doesn't bother you he has to move his house every Tuesday between 10:00 and 2:00? 
No, I've always wanted to travel. 
Come on, you can't really be in love with him, right? 
I mean, you can't love Deke. 
Max, you're in love with that cute mochaccino homeless guy with the Jew-fro? 
He is not homeless. He lives 
in a beautifully decorated dumpster. 
So homeless? 
I get it. 
You know, I used to be engaged to a man who lived in the sewers. 
Yeah, the heart wants what it wants. 
Plus he told me he was friends with the Mutant Ninja Turtles, and they were a huge deal at the time. 
At the time? 
If he can introduce me to Donatello, get him back. 
How did you know you loved this... Sewer man? 
Well, he made me laugh. 
He was very passionate, and I wanted to be with him constantly. 
Probably because he got me hooked on heroin. 
That was a crazy summer. 
See? 
I feel the same way. 
Minus the heroin part, unfortunately. 
Hey, can I use your bathroom? I have 
to tinkle, and there's a wasp in mine. 
Go ahead, Sophie. 
What's that look? 
Is the wasp behind me? 
I can't believe you. 
Even after three years of being friends with me, you still have a thing against poor people. 
Max, you love him, I can love him. 
I just have to get to know him better. 
Invite me over to the garbage can for a wine and cheese party. 
Wait a minute. 
Wine and cheese party? 
Oh, I'm gonna bring my new boy toy. 
He's the Caesar salad pepperer at the Olive Garden. 
No dates, Sophie. 
The place is so small, I once accidentally took it home in my purse. 
This camembert smells like feet, so you know it's good. 
Look at you, Mayor McCheese. 
So fancy. 
It's just the usual diner crew, you know. 
We serve imitation imitation crab. 
Well, I just wanted to class the place up for you. 
You know, get some wine, get some cheese, flush. 
You did not need to do that. 
I love that you live here. 
And if a dumpster was good enough for me as a baby, it is still good enough for me as an adult. 
Oh, you love that I live here. 
Do you love anything else? 
Well, I loved The Karate Kid movies until Will Smith's kid ruined them. 
Okay, can we please be serious for a minute? 
Did you just say "I love you" because I said it first? 
Look, honestly, yes. 
But I definitely meant it, I think. 
Look, I suck at this stuff. 
This and not laughing when kids fall. 
Just know that if/when I say it again, I will mean it. 
I can totally wait... 
I love you, Max. 
Nice try, sneaky. 
Oh, hi. Come on in. 
And be nice. 
Remember, you barely have a bed. 
Don't worry. 
I love this area. 
I met your neighbor, the mattress. 
Oh, that queen? 
So would you like a cabernet or a Shiraz? 
Shiraz. 
Oh, that's a real name? 
Some interesting pairings here. 
In fact, I'm looking at one as we speak. 
Please, someone else come right now. 
Hi, everyone! 
I'm here. 
Please, someone else come right now. 
I brought some homemade kimchi bin dae duk. 
Would you like to try it, or should I just throw it right into the garbage? 
It took me a year to get this kind of smell out of here, but thanks, Han. 
Oh, what a dump. 
I thought of that on the way over. 
All right, let's do this. 
I'm ready to rage all night, baby. 
Oh, hell no. 
I am too old for this. 
Sophie, watch your head. 
You might wanna take your heels off. 
Take my heels off? 
Communist Russia couldn't get me to take my heels off. 
Hey, Earl, you wanna go get drunk somewhere we don't have to bend over till we want to? 
Indeed, I do. 
Not to brag, but I'm the only one who can stand up in here. 
Cool brag, Han. 
 So, Deke, tell me about yourself. 
 Hey, stop Guantanamo Baying him. 
Well, I go to pastry school, I live in a dumpster, and I was thrown out of One Direction for being too handsome. 
 That's about it. 
 There must be more to you than that. 
I mean, I'm surprised to see a Roquefort cheese paired with a 2001 Syrah from the Rhone region of France at a dumpster party. 
Where'd you learn about wine? 
Well, I wanted to impress you, and I keep my adult grape juice game on point. 
So where are you from originally? Did 
you grow up in a storage facility or... 
Will you stop? 
He looks nervous like the fat guy at a birthday party when he finds out there's a pool. 
Coming, coming. 
Good. 
We have the right dumpster. 
I brought some wine. 
Bebe brought cheese. 
Kind of. 
Hey, guys, thanks for inviting me. 
Happy to be included. 
All right, another babe. 
Throw your keys in the bowl. 
Right now, it's just me and Han, and... 
That ain't happening. 
What is Nicolas doing here? 
Hide me. 
I think you're gonna run into him. 
 Sorry, I thought you were into him. 
 I'm not into him. 
Please, Caroline, relax. 
It's just a party. I'm here as a friend. 
 Then where is your hand? 
 On your beautiful bottom. 
Sorry, it's crowded. It was 
either there or in the sink. 
 Please remove it. 
 II did. 
That one's mine, baby. 
Come on, it's 8:45, and nobody's got their tops off. 
Somebody's gotta do something. 
Oh, one time I played Seven Minutes in Heaven. 
Well, I got hit by a bus, and I was dead for seven minutes. 
Bebe, do you want some wine? 
Sure, why not? I don't have anything 
to do tomorrow except move to Canada. 
What? 
Yeah, no biggie. Long story short, 
they found me. 
Caroline, looks like it's gonna be just you and me in the office. 
Nicolas, please. What did I 
tell you about your hand? 
That's me! 
I was trying to push my way to the cheese. 
Hey, Bebe Gun, if you're ever in Alberta, hit the Fairmont at Banff... super fun. 
I got wasted and cannonballed into the lake there once. 
It was frozen. 
Shattered my pelvis. 
Good times. 
Hey, I know that place. 
Fairmont Chateau on Lake Louise? 
We used to winter there. 
That's a really exclusive resort. 
I once saw them tell Barbra Streisand to take it to the holiday inn. 
Caroline, you want some of my triple crème? 
I don't want any of your crème. 
You know what, it's getting a little crowded in here. 
I'm just gonna slip out without anyone noticing. 
Oh, excuse me. 
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
So... 
Deke... what do you think? 
Do you like him now? 
Well, before tonight, I thought he was the guy who walks around singing, "When you're sliding into home and your shorts are full of foam, diarrhea." 
Now I find out he knows all about cheese and has been to this massively expensive resort, so I'm even more confused. 
What's confusing? 
The foam is diarrhea. 
Caroline, wait. 
 Let me walk with you. 
 No, no, no. I'm good. 
Please, at least take my scarf. 
It's cold. 
No, I'm fine... 
 Are you okay? Here, let me help. 
 No, Nicolas. 
I am not going to be the other woman. 
Despite the fact that I am literally lying in trash, I am not trashy. 
Caroline, listen. 
Things aren't always what they seem. 
Just because that is garbage on the outside doesn't mean that it cannot be a nice apartment on the inside. 
Just because I'm married on the outside doesn't mean I'm married on the inside. 
Life is complex. 
Your whole thesis is hinged on the fact that I think that dumpster is nice on the inside, which I don't. 
Good night. 
 Oh, Caroline... 
 Nicolas, please don't beg. 
 I just... 
 Maybe another world, another life. 
 I want... 
 You can't leave your wife for me. 
 No, it's just... 
 Seriously! You don't have to say it. 
No, I do. 
You have a diaper on your back. 
I am aware. 
What are you working on there? Is that 
a family having a picnic at a park? 
No, it's the letter "G"! 
I haven't written anything by hand since 1996. 
Well, my writing's really good. I forge 
a lot of checks and prescriptions. 
I'm kind of a famous doctor. 
___ You're really saying it. 
That says, "I love you." 
No, it's Khloe Kardashian windsurfing. 
Yes, Deke, I love you. 
Oh, Bebe. 
I wasn't expecting you today. 
I thought you moved. 
I'm on my way. My car's outside, but 
I remembered I left my medication here. 
Okay, now where's the big one? 
Well, as long as you're here, could you show me where the student financial files are? 
Sure, they're here in this folder I've labeled "Depressing." 
I wanna check Deke's file and see if he's on scholarship. 
He's definitely not on scholarship. 
His family's super rich. 
He's a Bromberg. 
Wait, Bebe. 
Bromberg? 
I thought Deke's last name was just "Berg." 
As in "Ice-" or "Pitts-." 
No, he just goes by Berg for short. 
You know, like me, my full name is Bebebebe. 
So you're telling me Deke is from the Bromberg family, as in the Bromberg Elevators... the ones 
that are in every building in the city? 
As in the Bromberg Colo-Rectal Center at the New York Hospital? 
Yeah. 
You know, I once left a purse and 2 feet of my large intestine there. 
Nice knowing you. 
Bye. 
Ooh, I'll be right back. 
If you mess up our batter, I'll cut your thing off. 
Sweet, I could stand to lose 5 pounds. 
I have some exciting news to share. 
Unless it's about an off-season Shamrock Shake, I don't care. 
Your Deke... dumpster Deke... 
is actually Deacon Bromberg. 
Of the Manhattan Brombergs! 
He's rich! 
What are you talking about? 
That is crazy. 
I would know if he were rich. I wouldn't 
have just told a rich guy I love him. 
It's all right here. 
Isn't this amazing? 
This is like buying a dress you love and finding out it's rich. 
___  Whoa, why'd you do that? 
 You're rich. 
 Max, wait. 
 You pretended to be poor. Liar. 
Ooh, lordy be. 
This kind of drama's the reason why I quit the Ohio State Football Team. 
Why are you so upset? 
Lying about being rich is at most a little white lie. 
It is literally the whitest lie I have ever heard, and it's a huge deal. 
I never would have fallen in love with someone who has money. 
We are drastically, massively, monumentally different people. 
Hey, Max, can we talk? 
Oh, I don't know. 
Depends on who I'm talking to. 
Am I talking to Deke or Deacon Bromberg, the elevator king? 
Man, if you're this upset about the money, how are you gonna react when you find out I'm really a woman? 
We wouldn't care. 
I never tell anybody I'm rich until after we say I love you because I don't want money to change anything. 
Money changes everything! 
Now excuse me. 
I gotta do my second job, which you wouldn't know anything about. 
Don't you have an Ascot Convention to get to? 
Still here. 
Also, two customers just showed up. 
We don't need their money! 
We're big, fat liars pretending to be poor too. 
Mm, yeah, my mom invented dogs. 
Any time someone buys a dog, we get 10%! 
Now I can't believe it. 
Even after three years with me as a friend, you still have a thing against rich people. 
Mm-hmm, I do, because rich people suck. 
They think they're better than everyone and are generally sucky. 
So he has money, I don't want it. 
Again, just wildly different people. 
And, Max, just because he's rich on the outside doesn't mean he's not like you on the inside. 
Life is complex. 
I don't wanna see you right now! 
Hey... I don't wanna 
see you either! 
Just toss me some chocolate with some cream in the middle! 
And speaking of cream in the middle... 
Your little homeless boyfriend is tryin' to get your attention. 
___ He's not homeless, he's not my boyfriend, he's rich. 
Rich...? 
And he's single...? 
Oh, maybe I will take off my heels! 
Hey, I'm sleeping at Deke's house tonight. 
Wink, wink, winky-wink. 
Deke's house? You mean 
your boyfriend's dumpster? 
Yeah. So I need a, uh... 
Tetanus shot? 
Higher standards? 
No, a condom. 
I'm about to have sex, and I want it to feel bad. 
I should have one in my purse from the last time I had sex. 
They had purses the last time you had sex? 
No, we carried animal hides tied with sticks. 
It hasn't been that long. 
Oh, here's one next to this movie ticket stub from Precious. 
Okay, it's been that long. 
You saw Precious without a condom? 
It says, "Best if used before September 2012." 
Just like the milk here. 
I wish I knew a guy with a condom. 
A man, any man. 
Oleg, do you happen to have... 
Okay, this should get you through the night. 
But if it doesn't, You can use this freezer bag and a rubber band. 
Max, I laid out the little cups, so all you have to do is fill them with cole slaw. 
Said the girl who was on the Forbes "top ten to watch" list. 
I can't do my side work tonight. 
Normally I'd say it's because I'm drunk, But tonight it's because my back hurts and I'm drunk. 
Here, babe, I got you something that might help your back feel better. 
A breast reduction? 
No! 
Why would you spit in the face of God? 
Everybody, calm down. 
Those aren't going anywhere. 
And if they are, I am going with them. 
I got some cooling patches to soothe her muscles. 
And when that doesn't work, I have another brand called "maui wowie." 
Pickup. 
 I'll see you later. Love you. 
 Love you. 
Deke, breath. 
What is that? 
Teriyaki beef jerky. 
Why, is it bad? 
No. Give me another hit. 
That is delicious. 
You know it. 
Max, since you guys are getting serious, why not go on the pill, so every night you won't have to play "What can we turn into a condom?" 
The pill is, like, 50 bucks a month. 
That's more than it costs to raise a damn baby. 
Well, your boyfriend's rich. 
He can afford to pay for it. 
Great, now I'm a white trash mom. 
Uh-uh, no way. 
I'm saving Deke's fortune for more important things, like Doritos Dinamita. 
Pretty much the filet mignon of corn chips. 
I mean, I'd be on the pill right now, But the one man interested in me is married, so I guess that's more of a bitter pill. 
Seriously, Max. Think about it. 
Fine. Why don't 
guys have to take the pill? 
We have to take all the pills. 
Birth control, Midol, roofies... 
Bonjour, Caroline. 
Chef Nicolas. 
What are you doing in the diner? 
Oh, no, I never wanted you to see me wearing this. 
Yeah, so be a gentleman and take a step back, 'cause as bad as it looks, it smells worse. 
I think you look beautiful. 
Your wife looks beautiful. 
Oh, yeah. Get it, girl. 
May I see you alone over there in the, uh... 
I guess one would call it a restaurant? 
But just for a minute. I'm working. 
What's that smell? 
That's today's special. Beef pot pie. 
Oh, it doesn't smell like beef. 
That's because it's not beef, it's not made today, and it's not special. 
Listen, Caroline. 
We have all this relationship drama, And we're not even in a relationship. 
Please get to know me better. 
Come to my home for dinner. 
Dinner at your home, just you and me? 
How do you think your wife would feel about that? 
We have an open relationship. 
Did you think I'm the type of man who would have sex with another woman without asking my wife? 
That is so American. 
Max? 
Why are you calling Max? 
I want to make sure I haven't lost my mind. 
Nicolas said he told his wife about me, and she gave him permission for us to sleep together. 
Ha! Good one! 
My boss at Quiznos once told me his wife's dying wish was that I let him motorboat me. 
Okay, so she may have been motorboated out of Quiznos. 
But I am not falling for this. 
Yes, I thought you wouldn't believe me, so I set up a Skype call with her from France on Friday. 
Wait, you want me to Skype with your wife about sex? 
Am I on Dr. Phil? 
Hey, everybody. 
I got a new dress, and it's bitchin'. 
Oh. 
Hey, look at him. Oh. 
Nobody told me they added beefcake to the menu. 
Excuse me, beefcake has been on the menu since I started working here. 
Wow, wow. 
Finally... 
There's somebody in the diner as good-looking as me. 
Hi, I'm Sophie Kuchenski. 
Nicolas Saintcroix. 
Ah! 
And he's French too? 
Oh, come on! 
I'm sorry, I was in the middle of a conversation with Caroline. 
Who? 
Me, the one whose feet you're standing on. 
Oh. 
Oh, wait a minute. 
Is this the married guy? 
Oh, girl! 
I'm gonna give you two days' head start, and then he's mine! 
Why do you care what his wife thinks about your hair? 
You're not gonna be sleeping with her. 
Although you'd be a lot more interesting if you did. 
I'm not gonna be sleeping with him either. 
And when I tell his wife that, I want to look good doing it. 
I have to look 20% better than her. 
And since Skype makes you look 20% worse, I have to look 40% better than I do now. 
You realize talking about math in a hair salon is my worst nightmare, right? 
Welcome to the Tristan Evans salon. 
Hi, hello. We're here 
for the student haircut. 
I'm sorry? 
The $6 haircuts for poor people from the people who don't really know how to cut hair yet. 
Max, that's not true. 
This is the Tristan Evans salon. 
I'm sure that everyone that's enrolled here is a genius. 
At least tell me they're gay. 
Just have a seat over there. 
I'll have somebody come up from the hair school and... 
Shh! So loud. 
Hair school. Got it. 
We'll just take a seat over there till they arrive. 
Girl, you just sit there, relax, and let Jameis make this head major. 
So weird, 'cause I majored in head. 
Girl, you are all everything. 
Ah...oh! 
That's a little cold. 
I'm sorry, what was your name again? 
Dan. 
Uh-huh. Dan? 
So just Dan? 
You're not, like, a Danny or a Dantrell? 
Dan. 
I need to get conditioner. 
Damn it, Max, I got a straight one. 
What makes you think he's straight? 
He keeps pushing my head down before I'm ready. 
Is the water too warm? 
Why? Are my pants too wet? 
Girl, are we in love? 
Max, I need you to give me your gay. 
Yeah, right. 
I'd give you my left nut before I give you my gay. 
You weren't even gonna get your hair done. 
Yeah, but I always wanted to know what it felt like to get a shampoo without a school nurse running that tiny comb through my hair. 
Dan? 
I have a magazine over there with a photo of a chic, piece-y, choppy bob. 
You can do that, right? 
Sure. 
Piece-y bob. Got it. 
'sup? 
Dan, Dan, Dan! 
Okay, done. 
You're ready to cut. 
Let's go. I can't risk some 
discount hetero cutting my hair. 
I'll see you at home. 
I'm pretty close to a hairgasm. 
That should've been mine. 
I haven't had a hairgasm in years. 
She hasn't had any gasm in years. 
Ooh! 
Oh, my God! 
Max, is that hair your new form of birth control? 
You look like Dame Edna. 
That's what I asked for! 
Hellooo! 
Now my outside matches my inside, because I've always been an old drag queen trapped inside the body of a young black girl. 
Hellooo! 
Oh, hi, Max. 
Oh, I used to wear my hair like that. 
I used it to smuggle cheese and cigarettes into the prison. 
Oh, hey, Caroline. 
Just checking. 
Still not sleeping with that French guy that I'm sleeping with? 
Still not, Sophie. 
He's married. 
Well, good. 
'cause I'm here to talk to that wife, and throw my hoo-ha into the ring. 
I even bought myself a flat French hat to make me more French. 
Yeah, I got me the hat 'cause I didn't have time to grow out my pits. 
Okay, the call is in one minute. 
I'll just do it from here. 
I was planning to be holding my Louis Vuitton shopping bag, but the cat took a dump in it. 
And, Max, bring that lamp closer to my face, So I don't have eight Skype chins. 
Fine, but if I get too close to the bulb, my hair might blow up. 
Here she is. 
Sophie, good-bye. 
Oh, no, I'm not leaving, baby. 
That French hottie and I are perfect for each other. 
I mean, look at me. 
I'm wearing a beret. 
I have a baguette. 
Bonjour, bitches! 
Okay, take a deep breath, and remember, this is ridiculous. 
Bonjour, Caroline. 
Bonjour. You must be Juliette. 
It is nice to meet you. 
And you as well, Juliette. 
I just want to set the record straight about Nicolas and I. 
I am not the type of... 
Yes, you have my permission to sleep with Nicolas. 
Au revoir. 
That's it? She's gone? 
I didn't even get to say "hos before bros" in French. 
So much more to say. 
What more is there to say? 
She said we could sleep with him. 
No, I'm never sleeping with Nicolas, no matter what his wife says. 
Good, 'cause you could never share a French guy. 
You won't even share your French toast. 
Thanks for coming. 
I promise, just one drink at Nicolas's, and then we'll go to the movies. 
And, Max, I can't believe you went out with that hair in public. 
I like it. 
You look like my aunt Esther, but not as hot. 
Oh, Caroline. 
I see you brought Deke And Max's mother? 
The only thing this hair and my mother have in common is they're both high. 
Nicolas, I'm not staying. 
I know you went to a lot of trouble with dinner, so I didn't want to be rude, but we can only stay for one drink. 
God, you look beautiful. 
Maybe two drinks. 
But definitely no dinner. 
Well, that dinner we weren't staying for was delicious. 
Yeah, we should not stay more often. 
I like your loft, man. 
It's the perfect place to live if you like to commit really sexy crimes. 
Well, we should go. 
No. You're not staying for dessert? 
You're breaking my heart. 
Well, maybe just one piece. 
We can share it. 
I thought you didn't want to share. 
He's not married to his dessert, Max, and it's just one piece. 
We're here, so he doesn't get a piece. 
You got a pretty sweet setup for a married man who's single. 
Creme caramel au coconut cake. 
Well, it's no Fudgie the Whale. 
Thanks. 
I love to cook for friends. 
Beautiful friends. 
Nicolas, just because your wife gave me permission does not mean I'm gonna let you take me over To that king-size bed with what looks like really good sheets and make love to me all night long. 
And then again that morning. 
So how's your back, Esther? 
Oh, Morty. 
I have to tell you something. 
Is it your heart? 
No, I'm on the pill. 
I know. 
You're on a lot of pills. 
No, a pill-pill. 
The pill-pill-pill? 
Yeah, see? 
You just pop 'em out one at a time. 
They're like pez for sluts. 
Speaking of sluts... 
Oh, boy, this is awkward. 
And I've testified against half my family. 
I agree, Max. 
Things are a little uncomfortable. 
So why don't we just make this as weird as possible? 
Damn it, I knew he was gonna kill us. 
Tango, anyone? 
Honestly, I prefer if you kill us. 
Okay, well, we gotta go, Esther. 
No, Morty, sit down! 
I'm not missing the show. 
It comes with dinner. 
Tango? Nicolas, you cannot be serious. 
Oh, maybe you cannot dance, Caroline? 
Can't dance? 
One summer, I taught ballroom dance to homeless teens. 
Because when you're dancing, you're not hungry? 
Fast-forward. 
This is my least favorite part of the Addams Family. 
 Look at his pants. 
 I know. 
That tango is giving him even less ball room. 
Stay. We don't have to have sex. 
We don't? 
I promise. 
I have to go to the restroom, Max. 
So do you. 
Come in, come in, come in, come in, come in. 
Okay, where's the coke? 
There is no coke. 
Why would you call anyone into a bathroom if you don't have coke? 
That's rude. 
No, I was just gonna talk to you. 
Oh, then I'm definitely gonna need coke. 
Okay, look. 
You are not sleeping with him. 
Of course not. 
But tonight I'm thinking there's something special here. 
I mean, we talked, and we laughed. 
What is this, Hey. 
If you guys are doing blow in here without me, I'm gonna be so pissed. 
I wish. 
No, Caroline wants to have sex with Nicolas. 
Even after that tango? 
Listen, now I'm thinking I want to sleep over, but not have sex. 
Is that where he puts it in but doesn't move it around? 
That's what I do when you're passed out. 
That's what I do when you're passed out. 
Look, nothing is going in anywhere. 
I just want to get to know him better. 
You really think you can sleep in his bed with him, and not use his penis as a body pillow? 
Of course. 
I've done that with every boy on the upper east side. 
That's why they called me the East Side Snuggler. 
And trust me, even though his wife begged me to have sex with him, I'm not going to. 
But didn't you tell us the whole reason you dragged us here was because you were afraid of being alone with him? 
What is this, Look, I get it. 
And if you two really don't think I'm capable of not having sex with him, Then hang out for a bit until you're sure that I'm fine. 
Fine, but we are not staying all night. 
Here are some blankets for you, Max and Deke. 
You can take the couch. 
Caroline and I will take the bed. 
Once again, our apologies. 
We are just too drunk to go. 
Too drunk! 
You did share that one glass of wine. 
Yup, we are too drunk. 
So, too drunk to walk? 
Well, I don't know. 
You be the judge. 
I am so sorry about this. 
It's fine, Caroline. 
I know what's going on here. 
Oh, and, Nicolas, before you go, I just wanted to say thanks again for the drinks, the dinner, the dessert, my pillow, and Deke's pillow. 
We get it, Grandma. Good night. 
We'll be right over there. 
And I'll be right over here. 
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs have sex with you. 
Uh, you and I are gonna do it, right? 
Oh, yeah. Think I took 
my pill this morning. 
Either that or I didn't take my pill. 
Wow, Max, this is a big step that you may or may not have taken today. 
You know if it's too much trouble, we don't have to go off condoms. 
So you're the one guy in the world who wants to still wear a condom? 
Do you have something? 
No, it's not like that. 
I'm just saying the pill is a big commitment. 
Oh, so do you not want to take this step? 
Because I already went to planned parenthood, And I never plan anything. 
Max, I guess I'm just surprised... 
Hold that thought. 
 I hear nothing. 
 So? 
So that's what Caroline sounds like during sex! 
Keep talking like I'm here. 
Uh... 
Ah, oh, yeah, baby! 
Right there! 
That's the spot! 
Yeah, now slap my face with 'em! 
Well, if you were still here, that's what I'd be saying. 
I'm sorry, I'll switch it up. 
Uh, go fish, Max. 
 Max, what are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
We're fine. 
We're just lying here talking. 
No, we're not. 
I'm really turned on. 
Why? 
What's he doing to you? 
It's not him, it's me. 
I'm the predator here. 
You were right. You better stop me. 
Get up here with us. 
I'm not getting in bed with you. 
Max, get in the bed. 
I know a Jaques-block when I see one. 
I am so sorry. 
This is silly. 
I know it must be hard for you. 
Uh, not anymore. 
You know, last night when you and I were in bed, I realized I guess Nicolas is just gonna be one of those people in my life that I'm always gonna almost have sex with, but I never will. 
You know? 
Yeah, like me and you. 
 Hey, Deke. 
 Hey, Earl. 
Best conversation I had today. 
Max, last night I got the idea that maybe you thought that I didn't want to take our relationship to the next level. 
What is this, And just to prove that I do want to go to the next level, I got you a ring. 
Oh, my God, Max! 
I'm so happy for you! 
Even though I thought I'd be the first one to get engaged. 
I think we all thought that. 
Deke, I don't know what you're gonna pull out of your pocket, but it better be a gun. 
Actually, I know you don't want a ring-ring. 
But how about a NuvaRing? 
A NuvaRing? 
How did you know my size? 
I can't wait to try it on. 
Well, I am not throwing you a shower for that. 
After I saw how you maybe forgot to take your pill on day one, and then took pills all day just to be safe, I thought you'd need a little help. 
So there, Max. Will you not 
have children with me? 
You're damn right I won't. 
Oh, wait, I think these take a couple days to work. 
Where are we gonna get a condom for tonight? 
Fresh warm cupcakes! 
Enjoy this winter wonderland with some hot, hot cocoa! 
Why are we open and selling to no one, when we should be closed and taking a floor nap? 
Yes, Max, it's a blizzard right now, but in an hour, it could be 65! 
That's the beauty of global warming. 
You, stop! 
I'll give you a peppermint stick! 
That is a straw with red stripes. 
Well, what sounds better, Max, a peppermint stick or... 
"A straw with red stripes"? 
First of all, great impression of me. 
And second, no one in their right mind is stopping for cupcakes right now. 
Oh, hey, girls! 
Guess who wants a cupcake. 
It's me. 
Here you go, Sophie. 
See, Max, we have a customer. 
And just so you know, I'm not gonna pay. 
Oh, I'm so glad you stayed open, even with all this snow everywhere. 
You know, good for you. 
You two are really committed to this little cupcake window, even when it's stupid. 
That's it, we're closing. 
These streets need to be plowed more than that poor married Jonas brother. 
No, wait. Listen! 
It's the snowplow. 
Now, people will be able to get to us. 
I told you, it is gonna be one of those magical New York City nights. 
Do it again! 
Season 3, Episode 13 "And the Big But" Why are we here? 
It's still snowing, and we have no customers. 
I had to put money in the cash register just to steal it. 
We can't just leave. 
Han's not here. 
Maybe the trains aren't running, or Han got knocked out by a snowflake. 
Well, you know the diner rule, the one I just made up. 
If he's 30 minutes late, we grab whatevev we can fit in our pockets and leave. 
Of course, if he's 31 minutes late and there's no one here, we all get fired. 
But I say we roll the dice. 
Well, whatever happened, we can't run the diner if Han's not here. 
That's right, who's gonna walk around here guessing what a vagina looks like? 
Uh, me? 
Pick up. 
I like this cold weather. 
I get to wear my chin-cheetah hat. 
Chin-cheetah...? 
That's not even a real animal. 
Yes, it is. 
This was the last one. 
Who's that food for? 
We don't have any customers. 
It's for me and Deke. We're studying 
pastry school stuff in the cupcake shop. 
We're also putting rocks in snowballs and throwing them at hipsters wearing those stupid stuffed animal hats. 
Max, you think school will be open? 
I was hoping it'd be closed, so I'd have at least have one day where I wouldn't have to deal with the drama between me and Chef Nicolas. 
Oh, is that the married man you kissed? 
 Who told you? 
 You! Like a hundred times. 
Ooh! 
Let's play a snow day game. 
Like what, guess the code to the safe in Han's office? 
I know the first two numbers are eight and nine. 
How about... 
if you could have sex with anyone here, who would it be? 
"Could have" or "forced to have"? 
Oleg, you go first. 
 I pick Caroline. 
 Oh, thank you. That's gross. 
No, Caroline got mauled by a bear in the snow. 
I did? 
No, it was me in a bear costume. 
She never saw me coming. 
So my only two choices are you or Earl? 
No, Earl passed away in his sleep. 
Of course, you'll feel terrible when that happens in a couple of weeks. 
Now, if you'd excuse me, I'm going to go home and roll me a fatty. 
Her name is Denise. 
Okay, so I pick you. 
Me? 
You pick me out of all these two people? 
 Luis, are you blushing? 
 No! I'm wearing blush. 
Don't worry, everyone! 
I survived! 
Still don't know where Han is, but the new Bond villain just arrived. 
Now there's an even bigger Octopussy in town. 
I'm very sorry I'm late. 
I got stuck in a snow bank, and I had to pee myself out. 
Where's Max? And I know 
shs's not trapped in the storm, 'cause she's the one who taught me how to pee my way out. 
Max, what is the French name for this pastry that looks like a bunch of glazed balls? 
A sha-sha-sha? 
No. 
A doh-doh-doh-doh-doh? 
Oh, so close. 
It's a "pata-choo." 
French and chemistry for pastry school? 
I thought class was gonna be like, "Which is better, cake or bread?" 
"They're both great, duh. 
Here's your degree." 
I have terrible news. 
Han's not dead, and he wants us to do side work. 
Do you mind? 
Harry Pothead and I are trying to study. 
Oh, Max, I know how we'll pass. 
We can ask that girl next to us in class for help. 
She speaks French. You know, 
the one with the bubble butt, Judy? 
Oh, yeah! 
Judy with the booty. 
You don't know her that well. 
Please, call her "Judith with the boodith." 
Max, can I interrupt this episode of "Ass Chat" and talk to you outside for a second? 
 Sure. 
 Hey, Max. 
Her butt's so big, she walks into the room doggie-style. 
Like I said to my uncle when he came into my bedroom in the middle of the night, "This better be good." 
Does it bother you when Deke talks about other girls with you like you're a guy? 
Not as much as it bothers me when you talk to me like I'm a girl. 
Look, Deke and I are just bros. 
I don't want to sleep with him. 
Not that there's anything wrong with two bros sleeping together. 
I'm not bromophobic. 
It's just not what this is. 
So you're sure there's nothing sexual going on between you and him? 
Yes, I'm sure. 
No! 
Watch, I'm gonna take a snow swim. 
Not that cold. 
You're right, nothing sexual there, unless you like adult men in underoos. 
Well, there's Nicolas. 
I was not prepared for this. 
Really? 'Cause we spent the entire 
subway ride preparing you for this. 
Okay, look, should I brace myself for weirdness between you two? 
And by that, I mean should I hit this? 
No, I'm cool. 
Cool as a cucumber. 
LL Cool J. 
Never been cooler. 
Ugh! Why didn't I drink 
before you said that? 
Oh, yeah. 
I am gonna ice him out. 
Well, maybe lose a couple of those cubes, because he is your boss, and the only reason I can afford to go here is 'cause you work in the office. 
 Don't worry, he'll never know. 
 Pretend you're Nicolas. 
Hello, Caroline. 
I am a man, but I am pretty like a lady. 
 Good morning, how are you? 
 Ooh, that was good. 
'Sup, Max? Look who 
I got to ride up with. 
 Hey, Max. 
 Hey, Jude. 
 You ever heard that one before? 
 Yeah. Is that, like, a thing? 
Thanks for the ride up, Deke. 
Caroline. 
I bet we were gonna have to take the freight elevator. 
Really? I assumed you guys 
would take the ass-calator. 
 Oh, hello, Caroline. 
 Good morning, how are you? 
 Very well, thank you. 
 Can't you see I'm mad at you? 
 Then why are you smiling? 
 This is my fake face. 
Then what does your real face look like? 
How dare you kiss me when you're married? 
I prefer the fake one. 
 Bonjour, class. 
 Bonjour, Chef Nicolas. 
Today, we will be concentrating on the chemistry of baking, for tomorrow's test. 
I don't know about the damn test, but I would ace a pop quiz on that ass. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I'll get that. 
Let Judy pick it up. 
It's a chance to see it in motion. 
You think she got that thing at a Kim Kardashian backyard sale? 
When you add water to the flour to hydrate the two proteins, glutenin and gliadin, those two proteins are drawn to each other, and they bond. 
Like I like to say, they're hot for each other. 
Max, look, they were drawn to each other, they bonded, and now, we've got our own big butt. 
Dat ass, though! 
More like dat ass dough. 
You need to wet the dough with water to keep it moist and supple. 
Wet your bread, everyone, wet your bread. 
Mine's pretty wet. 
How's yours? 
Mine would be, but it's on antidepressants. 
Work with your partner, help each other out. 
 Here, let me help, Max. 
 Yeah, mine's not as smooth as yours. 
Mm, keep kneing it. 
You need more water. 
It's better, right? 
Yeah, I think wetting it helped. 
Caroline, something is really wrong with me. 
Don't freak out. I'm here for you. 
Unless it's something I can catch. 
Something weird happened. 
I think I might have feelings for Deke. 
Oh, God, no! 
I mean, that is interesting. 
Let's talk about that. 
I don't know what to do. 
We're bros, and I don't want to ruin the friendship, which is really unlike me. 
I always ruin friendships. I've been 
trying to ruin ours since you moved in. 
Well, what changed with Deke? 
It was so weird... 
he was wetting my bread, and then my bread was wet, if you know what I'm saying. 
Okay, thank you. 
I'm finally off bread. 
Look, I understand. 
You can't always help who you're attracted to. 
It's like with me and Nicolas... 
This is not the same as you and Frenchie. 
I wasn't attracted to Deke before today. 
The first time you met Nicolas, your vagina fell on the floor and tried to crawl up his leg. 
Yes, but I scooped it up and snapped it back on because I was not born to have sex with a married man. 
If I was, I would have flirted with Matt Lauer when he came over for the Christmas tree lighting at my house. 
Matt Lauer... 
that guy's got game. 
No hair, but game. 
Hey, everybody, good news! 
Oh, I passed that kidney stone. 
Yeah, I think the skiing loosened it. 
Oh, I felt like I was birthing a baby through my eye hole. 
Did you save the stone? 
'Cause only three more, and you can make me that necklace. 
Max, don't change the subject. 
What are you gonna do about Deke? 
Oh, wait, I love giving advice. 
I had my own advice column in Poland. 
It was called "Don't Do That!" 
Sophie, have you ever had sex with a friend? 
Oh, no. 
Are you two gonna do it? 
 No, that is not what... 
 Oh, don't do that! 
No, it will ruin your relationship and my opinion of Max. 
What about your opinion of me? 
Eh, it's already pretty low. 
What am I gonna do about Deke? 
He's coming over to study tonight. 
Oh, God, I sound like such a girl from the '50s... 
Gonna go cry into my princess phone. 
You should tell Deke how you feel, and tell him tonight, because I think that Judy girl likes him, and I think he might like her too. 
Why do you say that? 
I literally don't care at all, but I just want to know, why would you say that? 
Max, he likes big butts, and he cannot lie. 
"At what temperature does sugar crystallize?" 
"Fahrenheit and Celsius." 
Go, Max. 
Max. 
Why are you looking at me like that? 
 This doesn't make any sense! 
 Well, your book is upside down. 
Hey, hearing a lot of chitchat in here. 
Just wanted to make sure you two are studying. 
Stop studying. Kiss him. 
All right, well, I better be going. 
 Just pretend I'm not here. 
 I always do. 
Hey, um, this is weird, but before we study, I kind of have something to tell you. 
Weird, 'cause I kinda have something to tell you. 
That is weird. 
Maybe it's the same thing. 
Someone wants to have sex with me. 
How did you know that? 
'Cause Judy with the booty just texted me, "Would you like to study tonight and then have sex with me?" 
I think you've interpreted that correctly. 
Wow, she's direct and, I might add, slutty. 
I know, she's got balls to go with that butt. 
So what were you gonna tell me? 
Oh, I was going to tell you what you just told me, that Judy with the booty wants to have sex with you. 
Glad she got up the guts to tell you. 
So go for it. 
Wait, you want me to go for it? 
Yeah, totally, go for it. 
She seems kind of clean, go get it. 
But we're supposed to study. 
I wouldn't want to bail on you just to go hit that. 
Hey, if you don't, I will. 
You're really gonna pass that ass up? 
Now get going, 'cause I have to memorize what temperature cho-cho-cho turns into chan-chan-chan. 
 So you're telling me to go? 
 I'm saying, "Tatata." 
Go get her bread wet. 
Make it rise, bro. 
Okay, then, bro. 
I guess I will go, but with that butt, if I come back a crack addict, it's your fault. 
Where's he going? 
Is this a condom run? 
Is he going on a condom run? 
'Cause if he is, can you text him to pick up a diet Coke? 
Can, not a bottle. 
You know the deal. 
He's going to have sex with Judy. 
You were right, he's into her. 
I'm so glad I didn't say anything. 
That would have felt terrible. 
 How do you feel now? 
 Terrible. 
But at least I didn't embarrass myself. 
I was this close to showing him my gnomes. 
Wow, you must really like him if you were willing to let him know that you're an insane person. 
Well, I'm about to be more screwed than Judy, because I didn't study at all. 
I know French. 
I can help you. 
You can help me with the keys you have to Nicolas' office. 
We are breaking in and stealing the test! 
Why are you covering his ears? 
He knows you steal. 
You took him from someone's yard. 
I can't believe we're sneaking into his office to steal your test. 
This is cheating. 
Oh, don't worry, I hear my teacher's kind of into cheating. 
Can't argue with that. 
Max, please hurry. 
Find the test, and let's get out of here because we shouldn't be in here and it smells like him and I like it. 
Okay, one of these papers has to be it. 
Oh, no, everything's written in secret code! 
Max, that's French. 
How is it possible he's even better looking in photos than in real life? 
Max, hurry up. 
I can't be around his stuff. 
My vagina's trying to get out of my pants again. 
Well, get her out here! 
Maybe shshcan help me look for the test, 'cause you're useless. 
Oh, no, it's Nicolas. I can smell him 
in the hall, and I like it. 
Max, let's get out of here. 
Okay, well, you have to stay and distract him, so I can sneak out. 
Just pretend you're not mad and you came in to see him. 
I can't just turn it on like that. 
What am I, an actress at a cocktail party? 
You have to, it's the only logical explanation you have for being in here. 
Caroline. 
I've missed you. 
I'm in your office. 
That's the only logical explanation I have for being in here. 
 Oh, sorry. Did I hurt you? 
 Oh, no, I'm sitting on something. 
Oh, sorry. Oh, those are 
the exams for today. 
Oh, well, let me just give us some room while I push these exams on the floor. 
Now, kiss me again, but this time, lay on top of me, so your legs are out of the way. 
Now, go! 
Wait. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
You know this can't happen. 
You're married. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go snap something back on. 
Well, here are the test answers, but I don't know what the questions are, because I only got half the test, and I'm only half sure those are the answers. 
 Whoa, dude, how did you get this? 
 I turned Caroline into a whore. 
Can you figure out any of this? 
I don't have any idea what these questions could be. 
Ugh! 
I didn't study either. 
Judy and I got to talk, and it got pretty involved. 
Well, now we're screwed. 
I mean, you already got screwed. 
Congrats. 
Proud of you, bro. 
Max, we're gonna flunk this test. 
Better go to the men's room and write all the answers on my penis. 
Don't worry, they'll fit. 
I hope you're happy, I've now kissed a married man twice. 
Oh, and here, I grabbed this from Nicolas' office. 
That's not the test. 
It's a phone bill. 
I know, I wanted you to see he doesn't call his wife much. 
Fire! 
Everyone get out! 
Move your big ass! 
We're gonna burn! Scoot. 
Oh, my God, Max! 
I hope Nicolas is okay! 
Don't worry about me, I'm right behind you! 
Caroline, I want you to be safe. 
Come with me. 
You're married. 
I'll just stay here and burn. 
Caroline, don't be crazy. 
This is all your fault. 
Don't worry about me, I'm right behind you! 
Max, wait. 
It's just a false alarm. 
I pulled it. 
So classy. 
You weren't gonna pass that test, and I need you in that class with me. 
You did this for me? 
Yeah, and for me too, I wasn't gonna pass either. 
But, look, when you were talking about me and Judy just now, you seemed kind of weird, and... 
Oh, hey, I just had a weird moment yesterday when you were getting my dough wet and I kinda got turned on, sort of thought I liked you. 
Yeah, gross, right? 
Oh, right, yeah. 
Totally gross. 
Anyway, dude, we're just bros. 
Okay, bro, but just so you know, nothing happened between me and Judy last night. 
That's lame... if you like a girl, 
you should just grab her and kiss her. 
Okay. 
 Was that weird? 
 Yeah. And I liked it. 
Max, come on! 
Oh. 
Sorry to interrupt, but we're supposed to evacuate the building. 
There's no fire. 
Deke pulled the alarm. 
I wanted to kiss her. 
Yeah. 
Turns out he's into dudes. 
﻿1 Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner, my name is Max 'cause the hospital wouldn't let my mother name me "Oops". 
I've been out of town all summer, anything new? 
Anything new? Let's see, well... 
Facebook went public and Edward Snowden went private. 
Kim and Kanye had a baby, so now there's another Kardashian to not keep up with. 
Paula Deen is out, gay marriage is in, and a teacher in California's out for letting her students get it in. 
Justin Bieber got a hit-and-run, Chris Brown got a hit-and-run, Rihanna got hit and still didn't run. 
Oprah gave Lindsay $2 million, cunnilingus gave Michael Douglas throat cancer, and Michael Douglas gave guys everywhere another excuse not to do that. 
Egypt went crazy, Amanda Bynes went crazier, and the NSA checks our phone like a crazy ex-girlfriend. 
Oh, and Texas hates women, Florida hates blacks, And everybody hates everything with the exception of Angelina Jolie, who is totally awesome. 
I meant on the menu. 
Anything new on the menu? 
I have no idea. Let me check. 
Hey, Caroline, anything new I should know about? 
The royal baby smiled at the queen. 
I meant at the diner. 
Oh. I think we're maybe 
washing the forks now? 
Let me check. 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  See, Max, one quick change, and we went from polyester and pitiful to powerful and proud. 
Just like superman. 
Except that superman changed in a phone booth, not a stall that says, "for a good time, call Max." 
Well, if you have a problem with it, why did you write it? 
'Cause I didn't have enough eyeliner to write, "for an interesting time, call Caroline." 
Look. 
Look, Earl, we're wearing our "Max's homemade cupcakes" t-shirts again. 
See the logo? 
Well, actually, I try never to look you ladies in the "chestal" area. 
It keeps things on the up and up. 
Oh, Earl, you are one in a million, literally, 'cause 999,999 men have only looked me in that area. 
Well, I got to go home. I've been 
watching Dharma & Greg on Hulu. 
Oh, I missed so much growing up in Korea. 
What, like puberty? 
Max, in my country I'm average height. 
And in my mind, I'm still rich, and my health care plan isn't Flintstones chewables. 
So who wants to go in the back and see how amazing our brand-new cupcake shop is? 
Bring down the enthusiasm, Rachael Ray. 
Right, we're not supposed to get all excited about this opening tonight. 
Last time, we made a big deal, and the shop didn't do so well. 
Ha! 
That's like saying the people near the nuclear explosion didn't do so well. 
Girls, I am so proud of you two, getting back up on that horse. 
After my first jazz record didn't sell, I turned to a life of drinks, drugs, and loose women. 
Funny how sometimes things just work out right. 
But how can you be opening your cupcake window right now? 
 It's 2:00 A.M.! 
 Our hours are 2:00 to 4:00. 
We're targeting the "post bars" demographic. 
Drunk Williamsburg guys. 
That's my target when I'm by myself and now my target at the new shop. 
Funny how sometimes things just work out right. 
We have no big expectations about the opening tonight. 
It's a soft opening. 
What's the difference between a soft one and a hard one? 
You want me to show him? 
Thanks, but we're cool. 
Seriously, it won't take me a minute. 
It's fine, Oleg. 
Just so you know, I'm already there. 
Get ready, this room's had an amazing transformation. 
 Rachael Ray? 
 I mean, it's fine, whatever. 
Han, before we go in, close your eyes. 
I want you to get the full effect. 
Yeah, and I want to trip you. 
 She's kidding. 
 No, she's not. 
Yeah, I'm not. 
Han, I promise, I won't let her trip you. 
Now, close your eyes. 
 What? 
 Now, I thought she was going to hit me. 
 She was not. 
 Yeah, I was. 
Okay, no more blind eye bull crap. 
Just show me the damn smelly back room. 
Let me turn off the lights for a more dramatic impact. 
What? I didn't do anything. 
It was me. 
He now knows what hard is. 
I cannot believe my eyes. 
I felt the same way when I first saw you. 
Original tan, original tile, original too. 
What do you think, Oleg? 
Nice. 
"Nice"? All you got is "nice?" 
This place was like Great Adventure for rats! 
They were waiting in line to bite us. 
Caroline, show them your bite marks. 
 I'd rather not. 
 Nice? 
It used to smell like the place poop comes to die. 
Or death comes to poop. 
And look what we did! 
We created the greatest, coolest, chic-est cupcake shop, and I love it! 
But you know, no enthusiasm. 
Just soft opening. 
And, Han, this was all possible because you gave us the space rent-free. 
Rent-free? 
Now, refresh my memory. 
When exactly did I say "rent-free?" 
On the 27th, 4:15 P.M., 
you said, "I don't care about that dump, you can have it for free. 
Burn it to the ground, for all I care." 
I knew learning English would come back to bite me in the ass. 
Somebody's already knocking? 
That's a really great sign, Max. 
Time to open. 
Look, girls, I'm blowing this party horn for you. 
Thanks, Sofie, but we didn't want to make a big deal, it's a soft opening. 
Oh, I love a soft opening. 
 Hello, Sophie. 
 Oh, hello, Oleg. 
Sorry, Sofie, about this uncomfortable meeting. 
If we had known you were going to surprise us,  we wouldn't have invited Oleg. 
 Yeah, I was there when you two broke up and I'm still suffering from PTSD. 
"Post-traumatic Sophie drama." 
There's no drama. 
And the award for the best drama goes to... 
Not us. Right, Oleg? 
Yes, we're friends now. 
See, girls, I cheated on her, so she smashed in my car windows. 
And my apartment windows. 
And your stereo and your flat screen. 
And my brother's flat screen and his daughter's computer. 
Yeah, she surprised me. 
She wasn't supposed to be home. 
We got it out of our systems. 
Good night, friend. 
Good night, friend! 
And, Oleg? 
Wow. 
That is one lucky horn. 
Honey, look. 
Look, some customers. 
Hey, cool guys! 
Come over here and eat something from the girls' soft opening! 
That is so not the way I would've gone, but I'll take it. 
Hello, hello. 
What have we got here? 
Welcome to Max' homemade cupcakes. 
In England we call 'em "fairy cakes." 
Fairy cakes? Damn it. 
Why are the hot ones always gay? 
Here you go, darling, give us the whole lot. 
Oh, my God! 
A black American Express card? 
I haven't held a black one in my hands in years. 
I would've guessed you hadn't held a black one ever. 
Sorry, it's our first night, cash only. 
Oh, wow. 
He is really out of it. 
 What is he on? 
 Besides me later? 
Do not know, but am jealous. 
And now I'm really jealous. 
I'm sure he'll be fine. 
Oh, I'd say he's more than fine. 
I'd say he's my next boyfriend. 
Ronald, mate. Wake up. 
He's not breathing. 
I can't wake him, call 911! 
Call 911! 
Let's all just calm down. 
I have seen this happen a lot. 
One summer I had a part-time job, I was a life guard at a crack house. 
He'll come to in a second. 
He's dead. 
Called that wrong. 
Max, the guy who died in front of our shop last night was a rock star. 
He used to date Kate Moss. 
No offense, but dating Kate Moss is like a law in England. 
Everyone has to do it when they turn 21. 
His name was Roland Glass, and he has two gold records. 
I can't believe I've never heard of him. 
I can. 
Your go-to jam is the soundtrack from Newsies. 
Yesterday a rock star, and today he's gone. 
You never know. 
That's why I ordered us breakfast from the fancy breakfast place on the corner. 
You ordered from "Magna cum latte"? 
Everyday when I pass by it, I think  2 things. One, I wish I had a gun. 
And, two, someday I'm gonna order breakfast to be delivered with one of their fancy-ass croissants. 
Who knows, tonight I could do too much heroin and die an unexpected death. 
But at least then I'd die doing something my mother loved. 
You're right, Max. 
You only live once. 
Yolo. 
And you only live till the next time you say "yolo." 
Oh, no. More bad news. 
According to my Google alert for Max's homemade cupcakes you have a Google alert for our business? 
I only have a Google alert for "Oprah goes topless." 
I'm not saying it's gonna happen, but I'm saying, if it does, I'm gonna be the first one to know. 
Look, it's online that Roland Glass died in front of our shop. 
And now my phone just died. 
It's an epidemic. 
Oleg, what are you still doing with the arrow from our shop? 
I thought that you said that was hung. 
No, I said I was hung. 
And I can't put it up now with that crowd of people in front of your window. 
There are people in front of our window? 
Dude, is this where my man Roland died? 
Yeah, right over there. 
Then I'm gonna put this here, next to Paddington bear. 
I caught this at his last concert. 
And I also caught this. 
So, like, what, dude? 
He just dropped to the ground? 
Actually, he hit right here first, smiled, then fell. 
He smiled? Dude. 
Max, can I see you over here? 
Sorry for your loss and dope hat. 
Thanks. 
I found it in a dumper. 
Max, what are you doing? 
Don't tell them he hit our counter. 
We need to distance ourselves from the entire event. 
This spells disaster for our new business. 
Dude, can I get three dozen cupcakes? 
Or it spells success. 
I have beaucoup friends coming here for the midnight vigil. 
How much are your cupcakes? 
$7. 
That's a lot. 
Dude. Roland would've 
wanted it that way. 
 Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  And he hit right here before he fell. 
And as he fell, he looked up at me and smiled. 
Content. Peaceful. 
That'll be $7, cash only. 
Mira, can you break a 50? 
Max! 
Yeah, what do you need? 
Change for a 50. 
Got it. I mean, why, God, why? 
 Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  Ten, ten, ten, ten. 
 Heaven's door  Max, we're almost sold out in here. 
I need more cupcakes from the kitchen. 
Got it. I'll come right in. 
Earl? 
Yo! 
Same split as before. 
30¢ on every dollar you sell. 
What a waste. 
You know how much money we could make if we sold pot? 
Oh, you want in on that too? 
Same split. 
Oh, man, that hippie patchouli smell is worse than the poop was. 
Han, shh. These people are 
in mourning. Show some respect. 
Me? Me show some respect? 
What will you two do next, sell cupcakes at the diabetes wing at the children's hospital? 
How dare you doubt my sincerity? 
I personally have shooed a homeless man away from peeing on that shrine twice. 
I don't care what I may or may not have said on the 27th at 4:15 P.M. 
Your business is booming, and now I want rent. 
No way, Han. That man 
could've overdosed anywhere. 
But God made him overdose in front of our window as a gift. 
And, yes, we are accepting that gift because you only live once. 
Yolo. 
This isn't "yolo" it's "hodo". 
"He Only Died Once." 
I'm surprised you aren't selling "hodo" t-shirts. 
How dare you again? 
We are simply providing some comfort food to people who need comfort. 
And, I might add, we are doing it with the utmost respect. 
 Knock, knock, knocking on the apple store's door  That's it, your business is booming, I want rent. 200. 
A year? 
A month, and it's a bargain for my beautiful space. 
This space is only beautiful because we made it beautiful. 
Yeah, show 'em your bite marks! 
Max, I'd rather not. 
You will pay me $200 a month, and there is nothing you can do to change my mind! 
Show him your bite marks! 
Fine! 
A rat bit her ass? 
Okay, 195. 
No rent, Han. That wasn't 
the deal you made us. 
This is not personal, it's business. 
I want a slice of grief pie! 
Show him your front bites! 
No! That's too personal. 
 Sorry you had to do that. 
 So am I. 
 It's healing nicely. 
 Don't lie to me. 
I think it's nice of us to add our flowers to the others. 
Shows respect. 
You're acting like you didn't steal them. 
Max, it's the thought that counts. 
And I thought it'd be cheaper to pull them out of someone's garden. 
Wait, where's the shrine? 
Look, Han moved it over to the diner door. 
That insolent charlatan! 
Whatever that means. 
 Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  Can you believe this, girls? 
He's cashing in on a man's death. 
Without us. 
And in his honor tonight we a serving chicken ala Roland! 
At a mourner's discount of just $8.95. 
Looks like Jiminy Cricket turned to the dark side. 
I also have rock star pudding. 
Nope. No way, Max. 
This is our shrine. 
Grab a handful of bears. 
We're moving the dead guy's shrine back? 
Wait, let me just light a candle for my dignity. 
It died here too. 
Max, do you want to be successful or not? 
Because if you do, grab one of these poems that doesn't follow any of the rules of poetry, and move it back to the cupcake window. 
Because this is our death. 
I think maybe you're being a little harsh. 
"Rock out in heaven. 
Love, Kevin." 
That is gold. 
Oops, knocked over a candle. 
Ooh, small fire. 
Fire on the shoe. 
If I don't get this out, it's gonna be my memorial service. 
Look, look. 
Those girls are disrupting the shrine of a dead man! 
Look, look, a roach got out of the diner! Quick, step on it! 
Look, hippies, look! 
Put down those bongs and look. 
They're moving the place where a man died for their own financial gain! 
Hey, that's so not cool, man. 
Yeah, me on. Yeah, boo! 
He's the not cool one. 
Yeah, look at him! 
Roland Glass died horrible death in front of our adorable cupcake window. 
See? "Horrible, adorable"? 
That rhyme just came right off the top of my head. 
Hey! Hi. 
Hi. He knows! 
I told him to stop peeing on the shrine when it was still over there! 
Isn't that right? 
Yep. That's the bitch. 
Yes! Yes! I'm the bitch! 
So not cool, dude. 
Let's get him out of here. 
No! Stop! 
That's my wallet! 
Ooh, stop! 
That's not my wallet. 
Stop! 
Stop Cast of Rock of Ages, stop! 
Put him down. He's cool. 
Even with those clothes and that head. 
I mean, really. Are we 
that desperate for success? 
We'd let Han be torn apart? 
I'm thinking. 
Caroline Max, I'm thinking. 
Well, no one's knock, knock, knocking on our door now. 
It's more dead out there than when there was a dead guy out there. 
I'm having second thoughts about how we behaved today. 
I mean, how could we have let Han live? 
Hello. 
I brought you some rock star pudding to say thank you. 
Oh, rock star pudding. 
What's in it, pills? 
Broken dreams? 
Tear-stained panties? 
Caroline? 
I'm not as easy as Max. 
Said every girl in my seventh grade class. 
Look, I was wrong. 
No, Han, I was. 
We should pay rent. 
I wasn't talking about the rent. 
Rent? 
Who said anything about rent? 
I was wrong when I said it wasn't personal, it was business. 
After Max stopped me from being torn limb from limb by the smelly hippies, I realized, with us, it is mostly personal. 
And a little business. 
A little business? 
What other kind could you have? 
Max, let's not be hard on Han. 
He's giving us this space rent-free. 
No one said "rent-free." 
I came up with a number I think is fair. 
 $250,000. 
 Yeah, sounds fair. 
I remembered that was your original cupcake shop goal. 
So when you hit that amount, we can talk rent. 
Han, that is so sweet. 
And I'm not gonna ruin it by bringing up the fact that she just said "hard on Han." 
Really, Han, it's so, so generous. 
But I don't know if we're comfortable with it... 
What if we offered you a small piece of the business? 
I'll wait for the rent. 
You two are good friends. 
A woman finally offers Han a piece, and he turns it down. 
Max. Google alert. 
Oprah's topless? 
Max, let that go. 
That's never gonna happen. 
Not with that attitude. 
No, the autopsy says Roland Glass choked on a Max's homemade cupcake. 
This is a disaster. 
Hey, where's your enthusiasm now, miss Rachael Ray? 
This place is the balls! 
And it's just a matter of time till those sicko hipsters are lining up for "one of those cupcakes that killed that dude". 
Open the window! 
We're back, baby! 
But we can't count on a guy dying every week. 
I mean, I have a positive attitude, but that's too pollyanna. 
We don't have to. 
That's what's so great about this window. 
Who knows what'll happen? 
Right, and we won't have to chase business down because we'll be right here on the street waiting for it to come to us. 
Max, I feel so good about the possibilities. 
One night it could be a black American express card, and the... 
Max, is it... 
Other nights, it's a friendly little visit from our homeless guy. 
Welcome to the diner ATM ribbon cutting ceremony. 
Everyone knows he's holding normal size scissors, right? 
Han's just excited there's something in the diner same size as him. 
Uh, this is just another waste of time. Like when you opened the diner. 
This machine is now open for business! 
After you're done with those, I need to do a little manscaping on my love mound. 
And after you're done with that, you can throw them away. 
Hey, everybody! 
What's that yellow tape? 
Did someone die again? 
No, Sophie, we got an ATM. 
I thought we already had an ATM. "Asian transgender male." 
Well, thank you for saying "male." 
Well, move outta the way! 
This broad's gotta do some bankin'! 
Be careful, you're the very first. 
We know how long you've been waiting to say that to a woman. 
Okay. 
No sign of Deke, the cops, or nosy white folk. 
Let's break in. 
I don't understand Why we're breaking into your boyfriend's dumpster. 
The only thing I understand less is how you pee standing up. 
Why? How do you pee? 
I am breaking up with Deke, so now's the part of the relationship where I sneak in his place and get my stuff out to avoid telling him I'm breaking up with him. 
Well, you just cut an hour out of every romantic comedy. 
You're welcome. 
This is the first guy I dated that has a crank. 
Most of them just did crank. 
Okay, so here's the plan. 
I'm gonna climb up on the garbage, Unsnap the windows, dive in the dumpster, and grab his spare key on the counter. 
Do you look at life as just a game of "set new lows for Caroline"? 
Why do I have to do it? 
I'm on parole, Caroline. 
We're breaking into a dumpster. 
I don't even think that's illegal. 
I didn't either. 
That's why I'm on parole. 
Light on the right, key on the left. 
We did this once after Deke left his keys at our favorite bar, which is actually just a liquor store where they let you drink. 
They turn a blind eye. 
Well, the guy is blind. 
Yeah, Deke always found cool places. 
Then why are you breaking up with him? 
He's perfect for you. 
You both think living in a tuna can is an acceptable habitat. 
So what if he has money? 
People with money don't live in the same reality. 
You think Donald Trump would have that hair if he were poor? 
Now, come on, let's get my toothbrush and scram. 
You bought a toothbrush? 
Oh, you really liked him. 
Wait, Max, is that one of your gnomes? 
Oh, my God, you were practically moving in! 
And it's your favorite one, Gnome-o-sexual! 
No, this is my second-favorite. 
My favorite is "gnome more drama." 
And he's not here because he don't want no more drama, And frankly, neither do I. 
Come on, let's go. 
You don't have to ask me twice to get out of a dumpster. 
Well, well. 
If it isn't Max-a-million. 
Or should I say, "Max who hates my millions"? 
Shouldn't you be occupying Wall Street or something? 
I am just here for my toothbrush, And then I'll leave you in your ivory dumpster to sit around and fart diamonds. 
So don't get the wrong idea, Uncle Pennybags. 
I'm not here to be Aunt Pennybags. 
Max, who's Uncle Pennybags? 
Is he one of the ones who touched you? 
He's the Monopoly Man. 
See? You guys are 
perfect for each other. 
Yeah, Max. 
We're like a more awesome version of John and Yoko. 
Meaning, like, just John. 
Who cares if I got a few million dollars? 
A hundred few million. 
And that's on the low end, according to bing. 
Well, I'll be by later, Deke. 
Come on, Caroline. 
No, Max, you won't. 
You're taking your stuff 'cause you're breaking up with me And you're too big a baby pants to tell me you're breaking up with me. 
Pfffttt! What? 
I am not breaking up with you. 
I just needed my toothbrush because I had dollar shrimp for lunch and I still have some shells in my teeth. 
I will see you later tonight for sex and various whatnots. 
I am not breaking up with you. 
That breakup was brutal! 
Yo, Max, I hear our boy Deke got major money. 
I shoulda known, 'cause the weed he gave me was real quality. 
And free. 
Earl, money changes people. I know. 
Every time the food stamps came, my mother was all, "Max who?" 
'Ello, my good people! 
You are quite fortunate today, For a rich person has come to dine in your establishment! 
Caroline, I would like a tabletop in Max's section, please. 
because it's high time she met the person I've been pretending not to be. 
The veil has been lifted. 
She was correct. 
I am the Monopoly Man. 
Right this way, sir. 
I believe I have a table here in the overacting section. 
All right, I'll give it up. 
You got me laughing. 
And I would miss all this if we didn't hang out, So I guess we can still be friends and pastry school partners. 
Pastry school partners? 
Your breasts are named in my will. 
Come on, you can't be serious about this. 
Don't worry, we can still do all the stuff we had planned for our future. 
Like TPing Han's apartment on the 14th. 
I'm not a monster. 
 Max... 
 Deke, you can't be my boyfriend. 
From now on I'm like welfare. 
You have to be broke to get some. 
Max, I really wish you'd reconsider breaking up with Deke. 
I mean, you guys get along great. 
He lives in a trash can, he shares your love of pee-pee jokes. 
He can hide things in his hair. 
Aren't those the things you didn't like about him before you knew he had money? 
Yes, but people can change. 
So change and like him. 
Come on, just keep an open mind. 
In fact, why don't you sleep on it? 
Right now. Go. Go to bed. 
Go, go, go, go, go. 
Boy, are you eager to masturbate. 
Hey, friend. 
Come on, get in. 
 I told you I can't see that anymore. 
 Why? 
You're my friend, he's my friend. 
We're all just friends. 
Where did you get a key? 
Don't be mad. I asked her for help. 
Caroline, get in here! 
Can't. I'm masturbating! 
Caroline, what are you doing? 
Are those new shoes? 
Uh, yes. 
Where did they come from? 
They were just here. 
In your size? 
It's a miracle. 
They're from me. 
I got 'em for her as a gift. 
What makes you think you could buy my roommate? 
She said, "I'll give you the key if you buy me new shoes." 
Ha! For love! 
I did it for love! 
You two belong together. 
Like me and these shoes. 
Come on, just give me a chance to express my deep feelings about this. 
Max, what I'm trying to say is... 
Pfffftttt! 
I don't wanna be your friend. 
I wanna be your boyfriend. 
Well, right now it looks like you want to be my girlfriend. 
Maybe I can help clear things up. 
How much is this gonna cost me? 
Nothing. Look... 
Max doesn't think she deserves someone rich because she has... 
Well, low self-esteem. 
Wrong. I have no self-esteem. 
And I can see the bottom of your balls. 
Max, remember two days ago when you loved the bottom of my balls? 
That's when they were poor and I felt sorry for them. 
Come on, you two belong together. 
You're like the Romeo and Juliet of ball banter. 
I'm sorry, it's just never gonna work. 
It's like we were raised with different religions, like... 
What are two religions? 
Are you taking suggestions from the audience, or do you really not know the names of two religions? 
Let's say... A witch and a Smurf. 
Question answered. 
So it's like I'm a witch and you're a Smurf. 
We could never be together. 
Everybody knows that. 
I've only lived like a witch. 
I've never lived like a Smurf. 
So I don't get you. 
What's it like being blue and soft? 
I don't know, I'm a witch. 
I'm green and all-powerful. 
So you're saying you can't relate to me because you've never been a Smurf? 
Wow. That's heavy. 
Well, I'm gonna go. 
Oh, I better take off this silly robe and put on my skirt. 
And she's giving back the shoes. 
Oh, no, she is not! 
"Language preference: English, Spanish, Chinese, French." 
They should've made this more specific to the diner. 
"Hipster, hobo, junkie, pregnant teen." 
Don't forget "ballerina with a head wound." 
"Would you like to see your account balance?" 
That ATM's a real bitch. 
Yeah, I got a hot 17 in here that's dying to get out. 
So did Oleg when that cop pulled him over. 
Caroline, look at this receipt. 
This can't be right. 
I haven't seen this many zeros in one place Since the diner Christmas party. 
That says $1,000,017. 
Han, your ATM's broken. 
It just gave Max $1 million. 
Out of my way! Out of 
my way! Out of my way! 
This is it! The faulty ATM 
that gives out millions. 
I thought it was an urban legend like HPV. 
Everybody freeze. 
The damn thing must be busted. 
And to think I bent over backwards to get that ATM. 
Well, I bent over forwards to get a "B" in Spanish. 
Damn it. 
My account's exactly the same. 
Frozen. 
So, Deke left this note for you earlier. 
I forgot 'cause I'm 120. 
Now you know what it's like to be a Smurf. 
Can you believe this? 
Deke gave me $1 million! 
So that's real money? 
The money's real? 
You have $1 million? 
We're a millionaire? 
Oh, good morning, my good man. 
I recently came into some money, thus the candy tiara. 
And I wanted to spread the wealth. 
Here. 
Have a pound of coffee. 
It's folgers, since I'm a millionaire now. 
Best part of waking up rich! 
I come bearing gifts for all my best friends. 
Here, guy who stands behind me... 
A 12-pack of triple-A batteries for you. 
And yes, they did have to open the glass case at CVS for me to get these. 
Here, lady on the other side. 
A shampoo and conditioner! 
Herbal essences, no big deal. 
And don't think I forgot about you, peek-a-boo hair. 
A Godiva box of chocolates. 
No, you're not dreaming. 
I said "Godiva"! 
Max, I have great news. 
And you, woman who sold me out for shoes. 
I got you something very special when I was out gift shopping. 
You know how you always say, "Who do I have to bang to get a chip clip around here?" 
Me! 
Wait, you spent money? 
How much of our million did you spend on your... 
We'll call it a shopping spree. 
Almost all of it. 
$143! 
Okay, our public schools have failed you. 
Or they would have if you'd went. 
But I'm too excited to care. 
First things first. 
When do we quit the diner? 
What are you talking about? 
We're not quitting the diner. 
I'm giving the rest of the money back. 
Hold on, hold on, pump the brakes. 
What's the problem? 
You got a chip clip. You're set. 
I only spent it to make a point to Deke. 
You can't give it back. 
I have plans. Big plans. 
After we quit the diner, I found a guy who can turn that measly million into 3. 
And don't worry, he was not named in my father's Ponzi scheme. 
Well, not by the name he goes by now. 
What up, Smurfette? 
Oh, hello, Deke. 
You just missed me passing out all the gifts I bought with your million, But you're here in time to see me buy Big Mary as my lab partner. 
Who says I'm for sale? 
A fireman's calendar... 
And another fireman's calendar. 
Sold. 
I bet you didn't think I'd spend that money, hmm? 
Well, you were wrong. 
I spent $143! 
Max, I wanted you to spend the money so you know what it's like to be rich. 
Now we're both Smurfs. 
You can relate to me again. 
Wanna go do hand stuff by the ovens like we did last Tuesday? 
Oh, so you were just trying to buy me with the money? 
Well, I'm not a high-priced call girl. 
'cause Super Bowl weekend's over. 
Here. I'm giving you the 
rest of the money back. 
Okay... 
Obviously, she is not mentally competent enough to handle her finances. 
This is like when my grandma wanted to give all her money to that orphanage, so they had her diagnosed with Alzheimer's. 
Here. 
I can't believe I'm losing all of my money twice in one lifetime. 
Who has an inhaler? 
And check it. I even 
put your name on there. 
"Deke Mc-richy Mc-never-had-to-work-for-anything"? 
Oh, sorry, I probably should've added, "Richy rich pretended-he-was-poor-instein" So they'd know it's you. 
Here, I'll fix it. 
Oh, yes. I treat myself well. 
You know what, Max? Stop. 
I've tried everything to show you I'm not Some cartoon rich guy, and you still think I'm a joke. 
You only see me as my money, but I'm not. 
That's how much money means to me. 
But you were right. 
It's not gonna work with us. 
Max. Oh, I got your gift. 
I love my new vibrator. 
It's not a vibrator, Sophie. 
It's a dustbuster. 
Oh. 
Well, there's no dust there anymore. 
I'll be in my booth. 
Waitress. Waitress. 
"Waitress"? Who's she talking to? 
Miss... 
This salmon tastes like chicken. 
That's weird, 'cause it's pork. 
I don't need attitude from some waitress. 
Who is this waitress you keep referring to? 
Your job is to take my order, put a smile on your face, and serve me. 
Oh, hell, no! 
I don't have to take this. 
Let me show you something, doll. 
This is my receipt from the last time I used the atm. 
You see where it says "account balance" at the bottom there? 
Read that number to me, please. 
If you have $1 million, why would you be working here? 
Good question. 
Hey. 
You seem cranky. 
You want to use my dustbuster? 
That woman just asked me if I have $1 million, why am I working here? 
That's what I've been saying. 
I mean, I have $1 million. 
That's what I've been saying. 
I don't need to be in this dump! 
Again, that's what I've... 
You've been saying! 
I know, I'm an idiot! 
I'm keeping that money! 
That's what I've been saying! 
 Max, Caroline... 
 No. 
You don't even know what I was about to say. 
Whatever it is, no. We have $1 million. 
Yeah, we have $1 million. 
Yeah, we have $1 million, and I quit! 
And I quit too, baby! 
I have hated this hellhole from day one. 
Sayonara, short stuff! 
I don't know what's more offensive. 
"Sayonara" or "short stuff"! 
I would go with "sayonara," short stuff. 
Wow. 
That got off quicker than a 12-year-old looking at Megan Fox. 
Quick? I've been trying to get out 
of this thing for three years. 
This zipper is stuck! 
This is like a horror movie! 
Help me! 
Get this damn thing off me! 
Tear it off, cut it off, light it on fire! 
Well, watch my hair. 
Oh, who cares! I'll buy new hair! 
Damn it, I'll just go over. 
Yes! We're out of here. 
No more diner, no more cupcakes. 
Wait, wait, no more cupcakes? 
What are you talking about? 
With all this money, we can grow our business. 
Oh, I'm not growing anything except a big-ass weed plant on my nightstand. 
But it's our dream. 
I don't need a dream. 
Dreams are for poor people! 
I have $1 million. 
I'm not going to pastry school, I might not even go to the bathroom. 
And I am definitely not getting out of bed. 
I will never do anything again! 
Oh, my God, I'll never do anything again. 
We're not quitting. 
I knew it! 
Between you and this zipper, I'll never get outta here. 
I can't. You heard what 
I'd be like with $1 million. 
I'd be dead at 30. 
But isn't that what you've always wanted? 
Hey, Uncle Pennybags, you home? 
I mean, you dumpster? 
Hey, can I come in? 
Or did you already move on? 
'Cause I'd get it if you did. 
Nah, come in. Just sittin' 
in here fartin' diamonds. 
Look, I think I owe you an apology. 
You know how I called you a lazy Mc-richy Rich who never had to work for anything and lives in an ivory dumpster? 
Is this part of the apology or just the recap of mean things you've said to me? 
Just listen. 
Well, I was right, you never did have to work for anything. 
Okay, I'm starting to think you don't know what an apology is. 
But even though you never had to work for anything, You do. 
You actually get up, you go to pastry school, And you build dumpsters, you do lots of stuff. 
Hey, you're not even familiar with my charity: Orgasms for old people. 
I hope you're not joking. 
Look, the truth is I couldn't see past your money. 
All I saw was Smurf. 
And I thought witches and Smurfs couldn't be together, But I was wrong. 
Yeah, you were. 
Max, did you get back the check yet? 
Because I just found a different investment guy. 
A legit one in Germany. 
His name is Herr Schluffen. 
Well, I'm sorry. 
I'm giving it back right now. 
Herr Schluffen can schluff off. 
Wait, Max, can I hold the million? 
For just one more second, I want to be upper-middle class. 
Caroline, give it back. 
﻿1 Max! Caroline! 
Look, here comes Han carrying an iPad Mini. 
Or is it an iPad carrying a mini Han? 
Han has a mini iPad? 
We can't even afford a maxi pad. 
I am so upset. 
I'm stuck in a lie. 
Well, it's better than the time you got stuck in that backpack. 
Seriously, you guys. 
I'm in trouble. 
I just opened this email, and my mother is coming to visit. 
You have a mother? 
I thought you came to life after a kid in a toy store made a wish. 
(Peter Bjorn and John)  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Han, your mother's coming all the way from Korea to see you. 
 Isn't that great news? 
 Is this the face of great news? 
See, my mother thinks I have a girlfriend. 
My father still thinks I wasn't in the car when my friend hit that grifter in the Hamptons. 
She thinks I have a girlfriend because I might have told her I did. 
Did you or didn't you? 
I-I might have. 
And I might have sent my mother pictures of someone and told her that she was the woman I'm dating. 
Han, you might have catfished your mom? 
I might have. 
Catfishing... 
Right. 
That's when you pick up a woman in a bar, and when you get her in the light, you realize she has whiskers. 
P.S.... 
Doesn't bother me. 
No, catfishing is when you pretend to be someone you're not on the Internet. 
You know, like everyone on the Internet. 
All my mother wants is for me to be happily married like my father and her. 
All my mother wants is a cure for hep-C. 
Look, here she is. 
"Korean beauty June Kim, aka Sapphire"? 
Han, you chose a prostitute? 
She's not a prostitute. 
She has a website. 
Yeah, and I know a guy with business cards whose "job" it is to relax your rectum. 
It says she's an exotic dancer at this gentlemen's club in Manhattan. 
So just go there and hire the hooker to pretend to be your girlfriend. 
And there's a sentence I never thought I'd say. 
I tried, but the bouncer told me to wait in the alley for my mother like all the other children. 
So I was hoping you guys could go for me. 
Han, we are not doing that. 
Strip clubs, lies... 
That's not my scene. 
That's not your "scene"? 
You have a scene? 
What is your scene, Caroline? 
I haven't seen your scene. 
In fact, you haven't seen your scene in two years. 
Trust me, this is your scene now. 
Oh, I understand. 
Just one question... 
Did I or did I not let you have the cupcake window rent-free? 
Wow, Han. 
That's a cheap shot. 
Low, bitchy... 
I respect that. 
We'll go to the strip club, but if it's nude, nude, nude, I am leaving, leaving, leaving. 
That's the first time Han's ever been able to hold something over someone's head. 
Sapphire will be right with you, ladies. 
Thank you, my good man. 
Give me a 20 from Han. You gotta tip 
at these places or they'll murder you. 
Thanks, doll. You'se twos 
can have a seat on that couch. 
Oh, no. 
No, thank you. 
I'm not catching... 
Not catching "Sypha-gonna-titus" today. 
Well, if a whore's bath is appropriate anywhere, it's here. 
Max, please be professional when she comes in. 
No sexual comments. 
Considering she's used to walking in on dudes who have their junk in their hand like a sad present, I am sure I can manage to not offend her. 
I'm just saying that despite where we are, let's remember, she's a business woman like us. 
The chairman of the board is here. 
Hi, ladies. 
You ready for a good time? 
Been waitin' my whole life. 
Hello. 
It's a pleasure to meet you. 
I'm Caroline Channing, and this is my colleague, Max black. 
Yo, how's this gonna work? 
I don't do two at a time. 
So who wants to watch, who wants to ride? 
Oh, right. 
Neither of us will be riding, per se. 
Hold your roll, girl. We're spending 
a lot of Han's money here. 
If I want a ride, I'm getting a ride. 
 Um, is it June or Sapphire? 
 You can call me Paul if you pay me. 
June, we're not here for a dance or any of the other things you do that I don't judge you for because I'm very open-minded. 
I've been to Amsterdam. 
I'm on camera so I gotta dance for someone or my bosses will fire me. 
And then it's back to waiting tables. 
Told myself I'd never sink that low again. 
Yeah, we say that every day when we get dressed for work. 
Okay, sit. 
Let's do this. 
It's fine. I think 
I got all the stains. 
It's official! 
We've paid Han back. 
Um, could you turn the other lights on? 
She's allergic to the truth. 
So, June, here's the thing. 
We have this boss. 
Yeah, girl, work that. 
I'm being encouraging, businesswoman to businesswoman. 
Anyway, his name is Han Lee, and see, his mother is coming to visit. 
Oh, nice move there. 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
I wasn't encouraging. Just commenting. 
Oh, peek-a-boo, there's your head. 
Anyway, he needs a girlfriend, so he sent his mother pictures of you and said you were his girlfriend. 
I think it's her turn. 
Oh, uh... 
The gist is, he's willing to pay you to pretend to be his girlfriend. 
And I'm willing to pay you to show me how to do that with my hips. 
Ooh, you would make a great stripper. 
I know, I just have a fear of success thing. 
Can we turn the music off? 
'Cause I'm getting disoriented and, in all honesty, a little turned on. 
And I cannot be a latent bisexual with everything else already on my plate. 
How much? 
Whatever your rate is for sex, but you won't even have to have sex. 
 At the most, just kissing. 
 Kissing is $500. 
I love you. 
Okay. I can give him the 
"Girlfriend Experience" package. 
He has no girlfriend, no experience, and no package, so that sounds perfect. 
Here, Earl, when my mother comes in, pretend you are reading this. 
Ooh, the Bible. 
You know, I remember when this first came out. 
Didn't think it would be a hit. 
Earl, we're talking about our lord, Jesus Christ! 
So, no sign of mama-say-mama-sah-ma-mama-Han? 
I don't know. I don't know 
what she looks like. 
She's here. 
Ohm-ma! 
Han! 
I can't tell if she's a smaller him or if he's a smaller her. 
You must be Han's mother. 
I'm Earl. 
I was just reading the Bible, 'cause when am I not? 
Mother, this is Caroline. 
Hay-yo! 
Caroline, I didn't know you spoke Korean. 
I took it as an elective after I mastered Japanese. 
I had a hunch Asia was gonna take over the world. 
And congratulations, right on track. 
Caroline, your Korean is very good. 
 And this is Max. 
 Nice to meet you, Mrs. Lee. 
What does that face mean in Korean? 
It means zip up your top. 
Here, mother, sit. 
You must be hungry. 
I'll get you a menu. 
That's weird. 
These usually bring joy to the people. 
Han Lee, where is your girlfriend? 
You'll meet her at dinner tomorrow. 
She wanted to be here, but with church and all her work in brain surgery, she's very busy. 
And I thought it was unrealistic when you had a girlfriend that didn't need an air pump. 
Han, what are you thinking? 
How are you ever going to pull this off? 
With the help of my two best friends? 
Oh, good. 
Who are they? 
Please, have June come to your apartment and we can brief her. 
Well, if it's with you, it's gonna be brief. 
Remember, you owe me. 
No, Han. At that club, 
I saw a pregnant wall. 
So... 
I think we're even. 
If I'm here to meet June, why am I blindfolded? 
So you can never find your way back to our apartment again. 
But I have your address on your work forms. 
No, you don't. 
Max, I think he can take it off now. 
It's been an hour, and we spun him around three times. 
Well, someone's been to a flea market. 
And it smells like pot in here. 
So I smoked up a little before work. 
I got to. My boss is a real butt munch. 
Okay, our call girl is here. 
Another sentence I never thought I'd say. 
I look like I've had a call girl before, right? 
Han, you don't look like you've called a girl before. 
I need to calm down. 
Do you have any chamomile tea? 
No, because I'm not a divorced woman on a balcony in the fall. 
But I do have something that will help you relax. 
Ooh, you mean... 
Yes, I'm gonna lull you to sleep with a tiny, invisible whistle. 
So, June, are you working your way through graduate school or something? 
No, I like getting paid for sex. 
I mean, what's a handy every now and then if it pays the mortgage on my park view terrace apartment, right? 
Life is so funny sometimes. 
Just when you think you're better than someone, you're not. 
Here we are, all relaxed. 
And that was wild, like getting your hamster stoned. 
Okay, June, this has all the details that Han sent his mom about you. 
You told your mom I'm a Harvard-educated Christian doctor and also a renowned classical pianist? 
Yes, we met at church and are crazy in love, but we're waiting till marriage. 
Oh, well, the Virgin Experience is 1,000. 
Will you take 800? 
 Max! 
 What? 
I was unconscious when I lost mine. 
And I want to see what it's like. 
Oh, I hope that's pizza. 
'Cause I could go to third base on some crazy bread right now. 
No! 
It's Sophie. 
I asked her to bring down some crosses for June to wear when she meets your mom. 
What? Sophie knows I hired 
a prostitute to be my girlfriend? 
No, I didn't tell her anything. 
But this will be a good test to see if you two pass as a couple. 
Hey, what's Han doing with that hooker? 
Sophie, this is June. 
We hired her to pretend to be Han's girlfriend while his mom's in town. 
Oh, wait, so his mom is supposed to believe that their parts match up somehow and that's a fun thing for her? 
Oh. L-O-L. 
Oh, this is one of those things that you think about later and you laugh. 
Look, look, Caroline, look. 
I brought you your crosses. 
Sophie, do you have anything smaller? 
It's a date, not an exorcism. 
Oh, well, you gotta say that. 
All right, I'll be right back. 
You see, I'm thinking about it later and I'm L-O-L'ing. 
Well, I gotta go. 
I got this. 
But that's a lot of material. 
You don't want to stay and cram it? 
How much for that? 
No, it's cool. 
I can fake it. 
 You're sure you can fake it? 
 Can I fake it...? 
Oh, God. Oh, God. 
Oh, God! 
Oh, God! Oh, God! 
She's sure. 
I wonder why Han and his girlfriend are late? 
Maybe something came up and she had to take care of it. 
That's actually probably exactly what happened. 
I hope my hair looks all right. 
I'm wearing it the other way. 
 It looks pretty. 
 Yes. Very pretty. 
I am just so excited that my Han finally found the perfect girlfriend. 
Oh, you know, his June is a brilliant brain surgeon. 
Well, she certainly knows a lot about head. 
And she also goes to church every Sunday. 
Yep, that girl is always on her knees. 
And she is a classical pianist. 
She is making this too easy. 
Oh, there they are. 
Han! Han! 
And girlfriend of Han. 
Mother, may I present June? 
June, this is my mother, Su-Min Lee. 
Please, call me Su-Min Lee. 
Which means, "so mean" to me. 
It's a pleasure to meet you. 
I've heard such a great deal about you. 
Oh, and Han has told me how you two met. 
What a beautiful story. 
Oh, yes. That was beautiful 
when we met at... 
Upstairs on the roof... 
Church! We met in church. 
Upstairs on the roof of church. 
We wanted to be closer to God. 
We are both so holy! 
Is it hot in here? 
Or is it just the situation? 
Oh, look, the appetizers Mrs. Lee is paying for are here. 
Before we start on the appetizers, June, please pray. 
 I don't know any prayers. 
 No, no, I'll do it, mother. 
But first please, can I get a Moscow Mule? 
Go, June. 
Please, pray. 
Oh, God. 
Oh, God. Oh, God. 
Oh, God! Oh, God! 
Oh, God! 
And amen! 
Oh, okay. I-I don't know 
that one. 
Hey. 
I am starving. 
That's quality. 
Such a good appetite. 
You ate the whole thing. 
Didn't even chew. 
June, the piano is free. Oh, you must 
play something for us. 
No, she can't play. 
 Yeah, but you told me that she was... 
 I mean, now. 
I mean, she can't play the piano now. 
Look, look, Mrs. Lee. 
The Chrysler Building. 
It has the word "Christ" in it. 
Hey, Han, you dropped your knife. 
You better calm down. 
You're gonna blow it. 
You can't afford to blow it. 
You can't even afford to kiss it. 
I'm getting tense all over again. 
Help a brother out. 
What, you think I just carry that stuff around with me in my purse in an Altoids container with a Lisa Frank unicorn sticker on it? 
Max, what is going to happen? 
I've got a more pressing question... 
How does someone with a mouth so small get a joint so wet? 
When June cannot play the piano, mother will discover my lie. 
It will be a big, big disappointment. 
I am the star of my family. 
So, if your family were the Jacksons, you'd be Michael? 
'Cause I see you more as a Tito. 
Actually, petite-o. 
Han's mom is right behind me. 
She saw you two come in here. 
I tried to stop her, but she has strength, and it is all core. 
Han, hide. 
I'm sweating through the price tag. 
And I have to return this. 
If I'm going down, I'm going down high. 
It's 500 for kissing. 
You can't afford to go down. 
What is going on between you and my Han? 
You two have been whispering all night. 
 Poor June. 
 Poor June...? 
Poor June lives in a doorman building. 
Mrs. Lee, I think you might have 
gotten the wrong impression of Max. 
No, she is after my son for his big successful diner. 
Oh, you have another son? 
I am on to you. 
You are just a money-grubbing, big-booby, dirty nasty girl. 
Well, I wish I could say you were wrong. 
Mother, stop! 
You cannot talk to Max like that. 
She is a good girl, and a friend, and... 
Wha...? 
Okay, yes, you caught me. 
I smoke weed. 
Yes, I'm living the fast life in New York City just as you feared. 
Wha…? 
But I only toke up when I am under a lot of pressure. 
See, mother, I don't have a girlfriend. 
June is a prostitute I paid to pretend, so you would think we were happy as you and father. 
Give me that. 
Wha…? 
I too am under a lot of pressure, son. 
The truth is your father and I are no longer together. 
He had an affair with another woman who has big fake ones like her. 
Max's breasts are real, Mrs. Lee. 
Mm. God bless. 
Mine are too, in case you were wondering. 
I wasn't. 
Son, are you disappointed in me? 
Mother, are you disappointed in me? 
No, Han. 
You are the star of our family and my heart. 
 I love you. 
 Aw, me too. 
Okay, that's enough. 
And another problem solved by weed. 
Hey, Han's mom. 
It's puff-puff-pass. 
Am I super high or is that whore playing the piano?
