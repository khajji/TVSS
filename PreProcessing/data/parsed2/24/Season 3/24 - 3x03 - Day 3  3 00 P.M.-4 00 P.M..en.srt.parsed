What if I can get us a copy of keeler's playbook? 
What exactly do you mean by "playbook"? 
His entire prep for tonight's debate. 
 Damn it, I told you to drop that. 
 Will you just listen to me? 
There is something you need to see. 
There's nothing i need to see. 
It's about anne. It's something that 
we didn't know about her. 
Something that could damage all of us. 
 Can I talk to you now? 
 Yeah, Of course. 
Kim, what's up? 
Chase and I have been going out for a while, and it's starting to get serious. 
I really care for him, dad. 
 So what do you think? 
 I don't know what I think. 
We want the release of ramon salazar. 
If you refuse to comply, the virus will be released. 
It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form. 
Maybe what you're looking for is a white powder. 
It would look like a bag of cocaine or heroin? 
Yeah, that may even be the strategy. 
Someone thinks they're selling a bag of coke. 
when, in fact, they're handling the virus. 
 Where did you get that money  It doesn't matter. 
Okay, we needed it. 
I got it. 
So this is how you're going to help you're family? 
By dealing drugs? 
I'm not dealing them. 
It's a stupid delivery. 
That kid's walking around with a bag of cocaine that's got the virus in it. 
He doesn't know it. 
I need to find him and stop him from putting it into circulation. 
You didn't shoot up, did you? 
Why? You think you can hide it? 
I'm not trying to hide it from you. 
I'm trying to quit. / Okay. 
People don't just quit, jack. 
I am not. 
going on record with this addiction. 
Do you understand me? 
You're the only person who knows about it, so it's going to stay that way. 
Give me an update. 
Kyle's still in his house. 
What about the package? 
It's with him. 
 And ramon? 
 Just waiting to come home. 
Good. 
The following takes place between 3:00 p.m and 4:00 p.m. 
Adam, have you downloaded everyone's folders for the meeting? 
Not yet. I'm still pulling up some of the 
medical details about the virus. 
Don't waste a lot of time on that. 
The only thing our people need to know is that it kills within 24 hours of exposure and we believe Kyle Singer is transporting it. 
I got all that. 
What about our approach to Singer? 
Jack's going to meet nicole duncan, head of health services, los angeles. 
They're going to take a haz-mat team over to Singer's apartment. 
He's waiting for her now.

Hi, Jack. 
How you doing? 
I'm okay, Nicole. 
How have you been? 
Until this afternoon, I was doing fine. 
You know, I, uh... 
I tried to reach you after I heard about Teri. 
Yeah, I know. 
After that, I kind of withdrew. 
But I appreciated the calls. Thanks. 
We should get going. 
I just finished running Macer's epidemiological model. 
Her estimates were off. 
Better or worse than we thought? 
Twice as bad. 
She had nine percent of the population infected within a week, but it's closer to 20%. 
And the infection-to-mortality rate is higher than her estimate. 
Almost 95% lethal. 
I've been hunting germs for 12 years and I've never seen anything like this. 
Great. 
Are you feeling okay? 
Yeah. Why? 
You're perspiring. 
I've been non-stop since noon. 
Look, we're going to be about eight minutes out. 
It would be great if we could go over the quarantine protocols before we get there. 
 No problem. 
 Good. 
If you refuse to comply, the virus will be released. 
I want the release of Ramon Salazar... 
Gael. 
Here, take a look at this. 
Closing in on the point of origin of this call. 
You see this code artifact here? 
 Yeah. 
 I found a few more on this recording. 
I think it's coming from a domestic switching node. 
You think the call was made from inside the U.S.? 
Maybe. I'm piping it 
over to your system. 
See if you can find a match. 
 Okay. 
 But do it after the meeting. 
What meeting? 
Tony's shifting resources to help Jack in the field. 
He's closing in on the virus. 
 Gael. 
 Yeah? 
Jack needs that audio feed in place when he gets to Kyle Singer's apartment. 
I know, but Tony needs me to take care of something right now. 
 I'll get it to you after the meeting. 
 I need you to do it before the meeting. 
Jack's on his way there. 
So come do it now. 
I can't! Stop bugging me. 
I'll get it to you. 
Fine. 
Have you thought about how it will be when Ramon comes back? 
How it will be? 
Like it was before. 
Things have changed, Hector. 
Nothing's changed. 
He's only been gone three months. 
You've changed. 
You've been in charge while he's been in prison. 
Are you willing to give that up so easily? 
What is it? 
Bauer's telling CTU he's about to intercept the package. 
 How? 
 I'm not sure. I'm about to find out. 
 Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer? 
 Of course. 
Then we're fine. 
Hey, how was the interview? 
Fine. 
What's up, dad? 
Your mother told me you paid the rent. 
All three months we owed. 
Yeah. I came into a little money. 
How does a 19-year-old kid who doesn't have a job come into a little money? 
Tim and I, we went down to the track the other day. 
He knows this guy over at the stables, so, uh,  we got a tip. 
 Where did you get the money? 
Dad, what does it matter? 
Honestly, the rent's paid for three months. All right? 
The pressure's off us now. 
Did you do something illegal? 
No. 
I told you we went to Santa Anita, and we got lucky. 
I didn't do anything illegal. 
Don't lie to me. 
I've got enough to worry about. 
Now, this is my house. 
I pay the rent! 
I take care of you and your mother. 
And when you get that job, you go ahead and pay me back, huh? 
Wait a second. 
We're not done here! 
No, we're done here. 
Don't walk away from me! 
You should be thanking me instead of crawling up my ass. 
Kyle! 
Kyle! 
Open the door! 
Open the door! 
His name's Kyle Singer. 
We think he's transporting the virus, although it's likely he doesn't realize what he's carrying. 
How could he not know? 
Health Services believes that the virus was made to look like heroin or cocaine. 
We know that Kyle Singer was hired to deliver a package from Mexico to a dealer in LA. 
He thinks he's smuggling drugs. 
That's the working theory. 
Now, here's the thing. 
Once Singer delivers that bag of powder, it gets cut up and distributed throughout the city. 
At that point, it becomes impossible to contain. 
Was LAPD grabbing Singer? 
No. 
Why not? 
Can't they get there faster? 
LAPD is not trained to handle haz-zone. 
Jack Bauer's going to go in with a team from Health Services. 
We're going to run the operation from here, updating the president in real time. 
Now, we have to approach Singer with care. 
He has no idea how deadly this powder is. 
I'm not fighting. 
I'm just asking the questions. 
 He should respect us. 
 Of course he does... 
now will you please calm down? 
$1,800 is... 
He said he won the money at the track? 
He could come up with a better lie than that. 
Well, maybe he's telling the truth. 
Oh, come on, Helen. 
 Where you going? 
 Wherever. 
What's in the bag? 
 Some clothes. 
 Well, open it. 
What? 
Open the bag. 
I'm warning you: Open that bag or I'm going to open it myself. 
Mom? 
 Kyle, listen to your father. 
 It's none of his business. 
As long as you're living in my house, it is! 
Your house? 
This isn't your house. 
You can't even pay the rent. 
Oh, Kyle... 
Come on, will you quit snooping, please? 
Don't even think about it. 
What is this? Huh? 
Coke? Heroin? 
 Give it back, dad. 
 What did you say? 
 I need it. 
 What do you mean, you "need" it? 
What are you, some kind of junkie? 
No. 
I'm just delivering it to this guy, okay? 
And if I don't get it to him... 
Who? 
 It's just a guy, okay? 
 Who?! 
Give me a name. 
Kyle, answer your father. 
You just give it to me, okay?! 
Stop it! 
Hey, stop it, both of you! 
Both of you! 
Both of you! 
Stop! Sam! 
Sam, don't, Sam! 
Kyle! 
I can't reiterate this enough. 
This is a credible threat. 
Salazar's people will release this virus if we don't find it first. 
So lets get going. 
Okay, we're going to need a white room with full audio and video capability. 
Get me 3b if that's available. 
Log him in. 
I'll be there in a minute. 
I thought you were supposed to be with my dad. 
I was. He sent me back here. 
Why? 
To question Parker. 
Parker? He already turned in Kyle Singer. 
What else are you going to get from him? 
Nothing. 
And that's the point. 
 I don't understand. 
 Your dad's sidelining me, Kim. 
He's making me sit out. 
Why? 
Why do you think? 
Because of us? 
 Chase, I'm sorry... 
 He says he's protecting me... 
but I'm not the one he's trying to protect here. 
You're not blaming me, are you? 
Look, all I'm saying is, we shouldn't have told him. 
What were we supposed to do? 
Keep sneaking around until someone catches us? 
We could have waited. 
Until when? 
He'd have the Same response no matter when we told him. 
I got to deal with this kid Parker. 
Jeffery. 
The food's exceptionally bad today. 
Aren't there laws in this country for cruel and unusual punishment? 
Tell Annicon, I'm ready to talk. 
Bauer couldn't tell me, but Salazar's got some kind of leverage. 
Enough to get him released. 
I'm not about to let this son of a bitch erase the last two years of my life. 
Call your friend at the state department, see what he can tell you. 
Annicon. 
 Mr. Annicon? 
 Yeah. 
This is Jeff Benson, Salazar's guard. 
I know who you are. 
Sir, Salazar asked to see you. 
Why? 
He says he's ready to talk. 
I'll be right there. 
University of Southern California Don't ask me why, just do it. 
I hope you can get a refund. 
A refund? 
From whoever sold you that load of crap. 
David, Keeler is going to use this against you in this debate. 
Now, ignoring it's not going to make it go away. 
Neither will dignifying it with a response. 
He's going to claim that Anne perjured herself, which, in case you've forgotten,  is a felony. 
 Anne is no felon. 
The allegation itself is enough to damage you. 
Now, come on, David please, think. 
You know you can't go into this debate without some kind of response. 
What do you propose? 
Talk to Anne, make sure she's told you everything. 
She has told me everything. 
Are you sure? 
Ever since I started seeing Anne, you've taken every chance to undermine our relationship. 
 Just because you don't like her... 
 You're absolutely right, I don't like her. 
This isn't about me and Anne. 
It's about you and Anne. 
Now, if she's got nothing to hide, fine, David, she's got nothing to hide. 
But you'd better find out before you face off with Keeler on national television. 
Did you ask your friend Jack Bauer what's going on? 
You did, didn't you? 
But he wouldn't say. 
Must be very frustrating, Luis, being kept in the dark. 
You have something to tell me? 
 I asked you here, didn't I? 
 Then start talking, because you used up my patience an hour ago. 
you are dog with a bone, Luis. 
Once you bite down, you don't let go. 
When I'm out of here, I don't want you on me anymore. 
When you're out of here? 
You were right. 
In a few hours, I'm going home. 
Really? 
And how will you manage that? 
Hector's a good brother. 
Unless he's got a key to this place,  you're not going anywhere. 
 But he does have a key. 
And when he turns it, the last two years of your life, all the hours you've spent away from your family, all the work you've done to put me in here will go away... 
...just like that. 
I wanted you to hear it from me, Luis. 
I wanted it to be the last thing you ever heard. 
Your son will be returned to you now. 
I'm just saying that Kyle is in over his head. 
We're not calling a lawyer. 
 He hasn't even been arrested. 
 Not yet. 
Maybe he won't be. 
If we leave it alone, don't do anything, maybe this whole thing will just go away. 
 You can't be serious. 
 Why not, Sam? 
Why do we have to let anybody know? 
 Because it's against the law not to. 
 What are you suggesting we do, call the police? 
Maybe they'll give us a reward and then we can pay our rent. 
All right, that wasn't fair. 
I'm sorry. 
Oh, my god! 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 I'm going to get rid of it! 
 You want to visit your son in jail?! 
 Wait a minute. 
Helen! 
 Get back! Get back! 
 Who are you people? 
Where's Kyle Singer?! 
 Kyle Singer! 
 He's not here. 
Isolate him and draw blood for a full panel. Get an oral swab. 
Seal off all these windows and vents. 
No! 
in here! In here! 
 No! 
 Put her in quarantine. 
Tony, the virus is out. 
I repeat, the virus is out. 
Copy that, Jack. 
Where is it? 
In the sewage system. 
Get DWP to shut down the lines from ground zero. 
It might also be airborne. 
Get the fire department and LAPD to set up a perimeter. 
Tell them we've got a level-three hot zone. 
Copy that. 
Come in. 
Wayne said you wanted to see me. 
What's wrong? 
Keeler. 
He's bringing your ex-husband into this debate. 
The SEC's investigation into his company. 
Well, Ted was convicted, and served his sentence. 
You know that. 
I know what you told me. 
I told you everything there is to know. 
Ted's company was introducing a hypertension drug... 
 and you reviewed the research. 
 Yes. 
Which later turned out to have been fabricated. 
Which Ted knew at the time, and I didn't. 
Now Ted's claiming that you both knew. 
He can't reverse himself 8 years after giving sworn testimony. 
Well, he is. 
And he's willing to go on record with the press. 
I don't know what to say, except he's a liar. 
It's your word against his. 
David... 
you have reason to be suspicious. 
God knows, you've been betrayed by some of the people you've trusted most, but I'm not sherry. 
I told you the whole truth once. 
I'm not going to defend it. 
Because if there's anything less than complete trust between us... 
I do trust you, Anne. 
You should. 
Yes. 
We need to talk, David. 
I'm with Anne now. 
Ah, let me guess�� She denied everything. 
I believe her. 
Yeah, well, listen, I might be able to make this whole thing go away. 
How? 
Meet you in the auditorium... 
alone. 
All right. 
So have you had a chance to take a look at Nicole's field report yet? 
Yeah. I'm almost done. 
What are your impressions? 
Based on what I've read so far, I'm optimistic. 
So you think we'll be able to contain the virus? 
At the very least, we should be able to limit the casualties. 
Even though the virus was airborne? 
Well, there is some risk of it spreading, but Nicole's team acted fast. 
They evacuated and sealed off the apartment building and quarantined the Singers. 
 When do we get the test results? 
 Five minutes, ten tops. 
So looks like we lucked out, huh? 
 Yeah, we deserve a little luck. 
 All right, look, I got to go. Make sure you keep me 
in the loop, all right? 
 Okay, you do the Same. 
 Okay. 
Tony, LAPD's setting up the perimeter, but they need wind vectors for the last 15 minutes. 
Call meteorology. 
Extension 212. 
Tony, local news picked up the story about the dead body being dumped at Health Services. 
Great. 
They want a statement. 
What do you want me to tell them? 
Nothing. 
Tony, warden Mitchell is on the phone. 
He's calling from the prison. 
He says it's urgent. 
Almeida. 
Mr. and Mrs. Singer? 
What the hell is going on here? 
Because this is not about drugs. 
We think you've been exposed to a virus. 
 A virus? 
 It's called Cordillera Virus. 
We believe that your son carried it in from Mexico this morning without knowing. 
What do you mean "carried it in"? How? 
He thought he was carrying drugs. 
So, we've been exposed? 
I'm afraid so. 
Wh-what does that mean? 
Are we sick? 
We're going to have to keep you quarantined until we get the results back from your tests. 
Excuse me for one moment. 
 Yeah, this is Bauer. 
 Jack, it's Tony. 
Tony, I think Kyle Singer's been exposed. 
Yeah, we've already got an all points out on him. 
Have you set a perimeter? 
Yeah. We're doing everything 
we can to contain this thing. 
All agencies and departments are in the loop on a need-to-know basis. 
 Okay, good work. 
 Listen, Jack, I know this isn't a best time to tell you, but I just got some bad news. 
I figured you'd want to know about it. 
What's wrong? 
Luis Annicon was murdered. 
 Murdered, how? 
 Salazar's guard. 
We've got him in custody. 
He claims that ... 
Salazar had a son kidnapped and threatened to kill him if he didn't do it. 
Jack, I'm sorry. I know you 
two worked closely on this case. 
 Tony, I'm going to have to get back to you. 
 Is everything okay? 
 I'm going to get back to you. 
 Jack? 
 These results can't be right. 
 They are. 
 Check it again. 
 I have. 
Blood and saliva, atmospheric and surface tests, they're all negative. 
We can't find even a�� a trace amount of this virus. 
What the hell are you doing? 
You haven't showered down yet. 
We're not at risk. 
What are you talking about? 
 I watched the powder get out. 
 It's harmless, Jack. 
Some form of silicate, but that's all. 
 What? 
 There is no virus in the powder. 
We tested five Samples. 
There weren't even trace amounts. 
Atmospheric and surface analysis also came up negative, and Kyle's parents tested negative, as well. 
You're sure about this? 
The only thing I'm not sure about is if we're on the right trail. 
No. No, the body that was dropped off 
at Health Services was linked to Kyle Singer. 
Why would Salazar's people pay him to bring across a bag of worthless powder? 
Fine, Jack, but where do we even start looking? 
I don't know. 
Wait a second. 
Macer said the only way to transport the virus was in crystalline form, right? 
Yeah, that's the only way it can survive outside a living body. 
What if it was never outside a living body? 
What do you mean? 
What if the virus was transported in a living host? 
What if Kyle Singer was infected earlier this morning in Mexico before he even left? 
But Salazar has no leverage if Singer was walking around, infecting people. 
That's the point. 
He wouldn't be contagious yet. 
The incubation period is 14 hours. 
Right. Think about it. 
We know for a fact that Kyle Singer was in Mexico 11 hours ago. 
Hector Salazar hasn't threatened to release the virus for another three hours. 
The math adds up. 
We need to find Kyle Singer. 
 Hello? 
 Linda. 
Kyle, I told you, I have nothing to say to you. 
No, listen to me, okay? 
I'm in trouble. 
Yeah, because you're dealing drugs. 
I need your help. 
What happened? 
My dad found the stuff. 
We got in a fight, I split, but he's still got it, okay? 
And I got to get this them, all right? 
These guys are hard core. 
I got to make it right. 
Make it right? How? 
I know, I was thinking, you know, maybe, maybe I could pay them enough, you know, just  to keep them off my back.  You want me to give you money? 
No, no, no, just borrow. 
How much? 
It's about 20 grand on the street. 
I don't have that kind of money, Kyle. 
Didn't you say your dad keeps some cash around the house? 
 Not that much. 
 Linda, listen to me! 
These guys... 
they will kill me if I don't give them something. 
Please... please, anything 
will help right now. 
Now you want me to get involved in this? 
Just... please let me borrow 
something, anything. 
I'll pay you back, I swear to god. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at the mall. 
 I'll get there as soon as I can. 
 Thank you. 
CTU knows the powder is not real. 
Now they're going after Singer. 
What do you want me to do? 
Stay with him, and as soon as he's alone,  Grab him and take him into containment. 
 Done. 
You can't let the cops get him. 
We need Singer to make this work. 
Of course there's no way we'll ever release Salazar. 
CTU is very close to containing the threat. 
Yes, that's right. 
All right, Stan. 
I'll make sure you're kept in the loop. 
What have we got, Wayne? 
I just talked to Anne's ex-husband. 
Now, listen, all Ted Packard wants is money. 
If we pay him off, he'll recant before this debate. 
That's blackmail. 
 That's business. 
 I don't think so. 
David, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than trying to defend against this allegation, which is going to hurt you. 
I've faced down worse lies. 
I think I've earned some credibility. 
You read the polls this morning? 
Because Keeler is closing the gap, and this race is much closer than it should be. 
And listen, I know it's distasteful there, but in cost-benefit terms, it's a no brainer. 
Anne won't think so. 
 Anne doesn't have to know. 
 I can't keep it from her. 
Well, that's your choice. 
But if this comes out, Anne is going to find herself on the front page of every single newspaper in this country, and David, she's not Sherry. She's not 
equipped to handle that kind of scrutiny, and you will not be able to protect her from it. 
Now, between this debate and the threat of this outbreak, you have enough on your plate to worry about. 
Don't be a martyr. 
Keep it simple. 
We could have the money within the hour. 
Do it. 
What's going on? 
They don't have their suits on. 
What does that mean? Are we okay? 
Yes. The powder was harmless. 
Oh, thank god... then you put us 
through all this for nothing. 
 You scared the hell out of us. 
 Mr. Singer, we still need to find your son. 
Is there anything that you can tell us that would help? 
Why? You just said 
the powder was harmless. 
We believe that your son was infected with the virus in Mexico earlier this morning before he came home. 
We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious. 
What are you saying, that our son could die? 
 Yes, that could happen. 
 Oh, god. 
I know how difficult this must be for you, and I'm sorry. 
But we need to find your son, we need to find him now. 
 Have you tried his cell phone? 
 Yes. The line's been disconnected. 
No, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
Wait. 
 He took my phone this morning. 
 What's the number? 
818-555-0103. 
Okay. 
I'm going to need one of you to call him. 
This is my fault. 
I never would have done any of this if I couldn't take care of my own family. 
 No. 
 Yes. You know, it's true. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
Yeah, Jack, I just spoke to LAPD. 
They've got a priority APB on Singer. 
Okay, good. 
I think we've got a number on him. 
All right, look, we'll thread the line through a tracing matrix. 
Okay. The number is 818-555-0103. 
I want you to route the call back to my cell phone. 
You got it. 
I want you to trace that number and reroute the call to Jack's cell phone. 
I'm going to need one of you to make the call now, I need you to keep him on the line as long as possible so we can trace him. 
What am I supposed to tell him? 
The truth. 
Tony, you set? 
Yeah, we're ready. 
 Linda. 
 Kyle, it's your father. 
Dad? 
We need to talk. 
Look, I don't know what you want to talk about. 
I already know how pissed off you are, okay? 
Look, um, whatever you did... 
I know you were just trying to help out your mom and me. 
Yeah, well, look, unless you're willing to give back the stuff you took, I got to deal with the situation, okay? 
Kyle! Please, don't hang up. 
Please! Listen. 
Listen to me. 
What I'm telling you is important. Please, 
you have to come home. 
Dad, why do you sound different? 
I need you to trust me onsomething I'm about to tell you. 
Dad? 
You may have gotten a virus, something you picked up in Mexico. 
How'd you know I went to Mexico? 
It doesn't matter. 
But you may be sick. 
And if you are, then you need to get checked out by a doctor. 
Dad, I don't know what you're talking about, all right? 
 But I feel fine. 
 I know it sounds crazy, but it's real. 
Now, there's e some people here who are trying to help. 
 Cops? 
 No Tony, have you got a lock on this trace? 
 We're going to lose this kid. 
 How much longer? 
I've got the cell tower, but it's covering a three-mile radius. 
I can't believe this. 
This fight, one minute you tell me that you love me, the next minute, you're selling me out to some cops. 
They're not police, Kyle. 
They're just trying to stop this virus before it becomes an outbreak. 
Dad, I already told youI feel fine, all right? 
They're saying that you're not going to start feeling sick for another few hours. 
 But by then, it's going to be too late. 
 Tony, have you got a lock yet? 
How much longer? 
10 seconds. 
What do you want me to do? 
You want me to turn myself in? 
Because you may be sick. 
And if you are, other people are going to get infected. 
 Tony... 
 We got it, Jack. 
He's at the Los Feliz Mall, between Vermont and Sunset. 
Okay, get his photograph over to mall security. 
Tell them not to approach him. 
Look, Jack, you're 20 minutes away by car, I can land a team there in ten minutes. 
Fine. 
Tony, I don't want you taking Chase. 
 Why not? 
 I just don't. 
Thank you very much. 
We'll notify you as soon as we have him in custody. 
Please, help our son. 
We will. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, I'm not sure you've heard yet, But Tony's heading off site for a while. 
He is? 
Yeah. I'm taking over for a few hours. 
 Okay. 
 Let people in your area know. 
 Okay, I will. 
 Thanks. 
What was that? 
Michelle. She's taking over CTU 
for a couple of hours. 
Where's Tony? 
They have a location on Singer. 
Jack can't get there in time, so Tony's going. 
What? Tony's not field ops. 
Seems like they're really going out of their way to cut you out of the loop. 
Did you do something to piss off Jack? 
Bad idea, Chase. You're just 
going to make things worse. 
Tony... 
I just heard they found Kyle Singer. 
Is this for real? 
We'll see. I'm meeting Jack 
over there right now. 
Look, I'm done with this kid Parker. 
He's said all he's gonna say. 
 I want back on the case. 
 Yeah, well, we're handling it now, Chase, all right? 
Because Jack doesn't want me there, right? 
Did he tell you why he's cutting me out? 
I don't really care. 
He's your boss, it's his call. 
This isn't right. 
Did he tell you this is because of Kim? 
He found out we were seeing each other, and this is how he's going to make me pay for it. 
Take it up with Jack. 
Just want to keep the line open for Tony. 
Leave a message for Jack Bauer. 
Damn it, Jack. 
Chase. 
Chase. 
Look, I know my dad can be hard, but he will come around. 
How do you know? 
Because I know my father. 
Maybe you don't know him as well as you think. 
What is that supposed to mean? 
Nothing. 
It's okay. Forget it, Kim. 
Don't you think I feel bad enough already? 
Because I do. 
We shouldn't have told him. 
Well, the only other option I can think of is for us to stop seeing each other, which as far as I'm concerned, is not an option. 
Or is it? 
 Chase, what do you want? 
 I want to be able to do my job. 
Kim, we need you at your station. 
Tony's about to land. 
Tony Almeida, CTU. 
I think we found the guy you're looking for. 
He's in the rotunda. 
 Bronson, lock down the east exit. 
 Yes, sir. 
Pierson, I want you to run point from the security office. 
Alright. 
How long have you been using, Jack? 
What? 
I did a rotation in rehab. You learn to 
pick out when someone's using. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You know exactly what I'm talking about. 
How long? 
For a while now. 
It was the only way I could maintain my cover with the Salazars. 
 Are you high now? 
 No. 
 It's empty, Jack. 
 Nicole, I told you I'm fine. 
 I'm not so sure. 
 If you're not so sure, then turn me in. 
I don't want to turn you in, Jack. 
I'm worried about you. 
You don't have to be. 
I've kicked it. 
I have a responsibility to stop this virus, and I am taking a calculated risk that you are more of an asset than a liability. 
Just please don't screw this up. 
I won't. 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, Jack, Security found Singer. 
I'm about to pick him up. 
Okay, where are you? 
Second floor rotunda, top of the north escalator. 
Where are you? 
We're coming into the loading dock, north entrance. 
 Have you got a visual? 
 Yeah, I got him. 
 Where have you placed your men? 
 We posted at all the main entrances. 
Okay, good. 
We should be there in a minute. 
All right. 
Have your men cover all the parking level exits. 
Let's go! 
I don't want to cause any kind of commotion. 
 Yeah? 
 CTU's here. 
They're about to move in on the kid. 
Just stand down. 
It's too hot. 
This is my only chance. 
We can't let the kid get caught. 
 No, no, wait. 
 I can't wait. Gomez! 
Wait here, I want to make a clean grab. 
Yes, sir. 
Kyle. 
Who are you? 
My name's Tony Almeida. 
I'm a federal agent, but I'm here to help you. 
What your father told you about your being sick is true. 
I don't believe you. 
You come with me, I'll prove it to you. 
Get out of the way! Move! 
Nicole, he's been hit in the neck! 
Jamie, give me your walkie-talkie. 
We have an officer down. 
Kyle Singer is not in custody. 
I repeat, Kyle Singer is not in custody. 
Maintain cover on all exits.
