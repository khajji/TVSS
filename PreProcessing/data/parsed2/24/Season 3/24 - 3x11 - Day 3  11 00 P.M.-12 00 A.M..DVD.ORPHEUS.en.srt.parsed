No, why did you want me to the basketball game? 
I don't know the difference between a field goal and a slam dunk. 
They don't have field goals in basketball. 
That's football. 
No, basketball, too Oh, jim, why don't you come? 
Ned would love to have you there. 
Ah, i'd love to, but i got the night shift. 
You know? 
Look, i wouldn't ask, Except this is a new school for him, He just transferred in, And i know he would appreciate Seeing a few familiar faces there. 
I'd be happy to come. 
Huh! That's great! 
Oh, he will so thrilled! 
Oh, i hope he gets a touchdown! 
Hey, honey, we're here. 
Yeah, i saw that, mom. 
Did you say hi to melinda? 
Hi, melinda. 
Hi, ned. 
And i have snacks if you're hungry. 
Oh, no. 
Really, i'm ok, mom. 
I know it means a lot to him that we're here. 
I can see that. 
Is that brad? No.34 
I mean, what's the big deal? 
What can he do that you can't do? 
That. 
Way to go, brad! 
Is that his girlfriend? 
Yeah, her name's krista. 
I don't know. 
What happened? 
Ned, what's wrong? 
Brad's points aren't up. 
Something wrong with the scoreboard. 
Maybe she needs help. 
"34 + gf = death." 
What's going on? 
34, that's brad's number. 
So "gf" is gotta be girlfriend, right? 
Yeah, brad and krista are like this uber couple. 
What? 
"Slammers be slammed?" 
Wait, this doesn't have anything to do with that awful slam book? 
What's a slam book? 
It's just this terrible website Where students can anonymously slam each other. It's--Ugh. 
What's going on? 
Delia, get up, go! 
Ok, ned, come on, let's get out of here.Ned... 
Ned, what the hell is going on? 
Tell me more about the slam book. 
It's just a way to hurt people. 
Well, it's working. 
������ �����11�� =�����������= ���룺 ���� 걼��᣺stoneiii  And right before the bleachers closed, The scoreboard said "slammers be slammed." 
Well, it's obviously a ghost Who's a big fan of a jump shot. 
You know, as opposed to slam dunks. 
Nothing? These are 
basketball references. 
Why am i wasting my time? 
Ok, have you ever heard of a slam book? 
Of course i have. 
The internet's wonderful contribution To ruining reputations everywhere. 
Yeah, these kids just create a webpage and tear into each other. 
Everyone can see it. 
You don't even have to sneak into the boy's locker room To find out what they wrote on the wall. 
Not that i ever did that. 
I never did that, either. Ever. 
I never had anything written about me, either, Which is awful. 
Zip, zero, nothing. 
Is there anything worse? 
Yeah, try this "Want milk? 
Try jay baker's man boobs. 
So you think this ghost is lashing out Because of what somebody wrote about it in the slam book? 
Maybe. Especially 
if what was written by brad and krista. 
Hey, morning. 
Hey, professor payne. 
Hey, you two. 
Hey Hey, ned, how are things going at school? 
Weird. 
Why? What happened now? 
Well, the school tnks they have a suspect In that gym incident last night. 
The girl who ran the scoreboard, what was her name? 
Lucy. 
Well, that means it's not a ghost, then. 
Well, it depends on who you talk to. 
The school feels they caught the culprit. 
Ned, on the other hand... 
Lucy's brother died a few weeks ago. 
Yeah, he hit his head skateboarding. 
He seemed fine, and then he just fell asleep. 
Concussions are like that Totally stealth. 
Oh, that is awful. 
And that's exactly why some people think that It makes sense that lucy did it. 
You know, she was upset, understandably. 
Maybe she blames brad and krista Even though her brother's death was an accident. 
What is her brother's name? 
Thomas. Thomas benjamin. 
Well, that's strange. 
There's practically nothing here. 
Just one kid calling him guano boy. 
Whatever that means. 
Where can i find a picture? 
Check the school face page. Here. 
Guano boy's better than nothin'. 
At least he's not invisible. 
Hello? 
Do you guys even hear what i'm saying? 
I don't know if he caused all that stuff With the scoreboard and bleachers, But i know he was there last night. This is the ghost i saw. 
Really? 
Mom. 
What? 
So if it was the ghost, that's good news, right? 
At least for lucy. 
You can tell that ned's a little biased on the subject. 
So lucy's a friend? 
Don't say anything. 
Uh, ned, i take it you don't agree With, uh, britfan20-12 who describes lucy as, quote, "Satan's deadly girl pawn?" 
Whoever wrote that doesn't know her. 
She's really cool. 
You should meet her. 
So then why don't you introduce me? 
Uh, geometry class? 
I sit right behind you. 
Uh, right next to tony neil. 
Spanish 2. 
I sit in the back, over to the left, Uh, by the pencil sharpener. 
I'm sorry, i have no clue. 
Don't take it personally, i'm new at school, ted. 
Ned. 
I'm new, too. 
That's why i thought you might, uh Uh, lucy, i'm melinda. 
Ned told me about your brother, and i'm really sorry. 
Thanks. Um... 
What's this about? 
Well, i was at the gym last night. 
Yeah, look, I already talked to a lot of people about it, so... 
I don't think that you did it. 
I was there at the scoreboard. 
I'm all emotionally messed up about my brother. 
It had to be me, right? 
Well, it's hard to explain, But i'm pretty sure someone else did it. 
Why? 
Do you blame brad and krista for your brother's death? 
It was an accident. 
Why would i blame them? 
Whoever wrote "slammers be slammed" Obviously blames them for something. 
Can i ask you more about your brother? 
I heard that he died in a skateboarding accident. 
He came home that night and put a bag of ice on the back of his head. 
He had his skateboard with him, So i figured he just wiped out again. 
And then he went to sleep and never woke up. 
Do you remember anything else? 
Anything he said? 
Nothing he said. 
But i noticed there was like... 
Chalk on his jacket. 
Like, the kind that they use To write the name of the football team on the field. 
This is gonna sound like a weird question, But were there any bad feelings Between thomas and krista What does the gym thing last night Have to do with thomas? 
He's dead. 
Oh, i get it, ok. 
You say that you don't think that i had anything to with it, but... 
No, it's not like that. 
Why can't everybody just give me a break? 
Lucy! 
Hey. Let her go. 
I'll see you guys in a little bit. 
Oh... 
Aaah! 
Aaah! 
Please, please stop! 
He's harmless! 
Just let him fly away! 
I don't get why we can't tell lucy. 
She'd be so relieved to know that her brother's here. 
For starters, she'd have some answers for everything she's being accused of. 
Yeah, i don't know if she's gonna be relieved, ned. 
It's a lot for one person to handle. 
I handled it when you told me my dad's ghost was here. 
I don't want to tell her about her brother Until i know what he wants. 
Officer: lucy benjamin? 
Yeah? 
Grandview police. 
We need to ask you some questions. 
Who would put a bat in there? 
I mean, who would think of that? 
It was you. 
You're the only one. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Brad: krista, take it easy. 
Why would you do that to me? 
I'm like the only person in this whole school Who's been nice to your brother. 
Why would you do that to me? 
I died becau of you. 
That's why. 
And now you're gonna pay Both of you. 
I just don't get why the cops were there. 
Lucy's not some psycho. 
It's the world we live in now. 
Schools feel like they can't be too cautious. 
Well, does thomas have any idea What kind of trouble he's getting his sister in? 
Well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. 
We just have to find out what he has against those two, And what it has to do with the slam book. 
So what do we do? 
Well, usually i would talk to lucy, But she seems to think i'm just another adult Who wants to blame her for what happened in the gym. 
Who else can we get to talk to her? 
I don't know. 
I mean, this whole thing just Ok, you know what, if you're afraid To have ned get involved with ghosts, Then i understand. 
It's not the ghost i'm afraid of. 
What is it, then? 
Nothing. I'm not 
afraid of anything. 
Me, neither. 
What are you doing here? 
Are you here with your friend? 
No. 
I just--I didn't mean to bother you. 
I just wanted to talk. 
Oh, god, i'm sorry. 
Um... 
I haven't been in the best mood lately. 
I should get going, anyway. 
I'm really sorry about what happened to thoma I shouldn't have... 
said anything. 
No, it's ok. 
It's...messed up 
How you don't really want people to bring it up, And then, if they don't, It's like everybody's already forgotten him. 
Were you two really close? 
He's my big brother. 
We were the only 2 kids in our family. 
He always looked out for me. 
Sometimes more than i wanted him to. 
Yeah. I got a mom 
who's like that. 
Just, i... 
Miss him so much sometimes, you know? 
And all this strange stuff's happening, And making it so much worse. 
Maybe i can help. 
What do you mean? 
Ok, this is gonna sound weird. 
Really wei, but i can't think of a not weird way to say it, So i'm just gonna say it. 
I believe in ghosts. 
And if you go with me, just for a minute, Maybe you can see how you won't have to miss thomas so much. 
Plus, it can help explain All the strange things that's been happening. 
The scoreboard, the bleachers, The bat in krista's car. 
The bat was just somebody's bad idea of a joke. 
Everybody knew thomas was into bats. 
I know it sounds crazy. 
Ok, wait, what What is this? 
Is there a camera somewhere? 
Are you gonna post This whole little talk on your slam book? 
I wouldn't do that. 
Just don't talk to me about my brother again. 
Stay the hell away from me! 
These kids must spend half their waking hours Slamming each other online, and nobody's immune. 
That's one of the popular girls, right? 
Turns out that's not such a blessing anymore. 
I guess it pays to be anonymous on the internet. 
Yeah. Being anonymous 
is part of the problem. 
These kids say things under the cover of a screen name That they would never have the courage to say to someone's face. 
Here we go. 
A slam on krista keeps it concise and to the point. 
"Liar. Two-Faced. 
Phony. Bitch." 
Anyone who sleeps with krista better get tested." 
"You're not kidding. 
Don't forget the rabies vaccine." 
Wow. Rabies. 
Gettin' slammed already for having a bat in her car. 
News travels fast on the internet. 
Yeah, except this was posted last month, Before thomas died. 
And there's a few more mentions of rabies Going back en further. 
You know what, i wonder... 
What's that? 
Krista's school face page. 
Look at the caption. 
"Here's me with a bat house i built with my dad." 
You know, maybe i'm wrong, But i'm guessing bat lovers united Is a very small club. 
Makes you wonder what else they had in common. 
Krista: i can't handle this anymore. 
"It's ok, brad's totally clueless. 
"I mean, what would i tell him anyway? 
I'm crazy about someone who won't even give me their name." 
Signed krista? 
Krista: i can explain. 
Brad. 
And that was sent to every kid at school at the same time? 
Ned: yeah, how is that even possible? 
Well, if i had to guess, i'd guess ghost. 
So what now? 
Well, it seems to imply That krista was cheating on her boyfriend brad. 
Maybe he knew about it. 
I can introduce you to brad. 
I'll be right there. 
Ned. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Where is he? 
Yeah, practice just ended. 
I told him to meet you in the team meeting room. 
I'll see you later. 
Thomas benjamin had chalk on him when he died. 
He was hit in the head with something. 
I'm guessing it was this board. 
You're the one that pushed him into it. 
Brad, i don't work for the school or the police I'm just trying To help thomas and his family get some peace. 
And you, too. 
But you have to tell me what happened. 
Krista had been acting strange for weeks. 
I mean, we spe all our time together, But she was sorta... 
checked out. 
She was always online iming her friends. 
Hey. 
Here's a tip When your girlfriend starts closing your cell phone around you, it's over. 
I really like krista, And i just I didn't want to lose her. 
I had to know who she was seeing. 
I know it was wrong, but i read her email. 
Some of the stuff she was telling this guy was so intense. 
And the weirdest thing was, E didn't even know who he was. 
Then i did something really stupid That i'll regret the rest of my life. 
I sent him an email pretending to be krista. 
I said, "let's meet." 
So you arranged to meet him here? 
I just wanted to know who the guy was. 
I had a right to face my competition, Tell him what krista meant to me. 
Then there was thomas. 
Guano boy. 
Brad: i couldn't believe it. 
Where's krista? 
She doesn't know anything about this. 
I sent the invite. 
Yeah, well, whatever. 
Look, man, i just want to talk. 
Yeah, well, i don't want to talk to you, man. 
You gotta hear me out, man! 
And that's when he blindsided me. 
Ow! 
Are you ok, man? 
What the hell do you care, man?! 
Get off me! 
Brad: and that was it, i swear. 
He seemed fine that night when he left. 
What about krista? 
How does she feel about all of this? 
Like i told thomas She didn't even know i sent the email arranging the meeting. 
It's me who's to blame. 
Quite an entrance. 
Just some friends from a previous life. 
I don't know why they can see me. 
Then again, i don'know why you can see me, either. 
Brad told me what happened the night you died. 
Did he mentioned the part where he killed me? 
He said that you threw the first punch, And that he thought you were ok and it was all an accident. 
What if it was? 
When i left him, he was with the principal, Confessing everything to the authorities. 
He feels terrible. 
Ok, it was all an accident And you have to forgive them and go into the light. 
Forgive them? Why? 
Because everything that you're doing, All these things you're trying to punish them with, These hauntings, it's just hurting your sister. 
She's getting blamed for everything you do. 
Who's blaming lucy? 
Is it the slam book? 
You know how they treat anyone who's different. 
No, the police. 
Ok, the school. 
You were there when they were questioning her. 
Well, they shouldn't be questioning lucy. 
That's the whole point. 
They should just leave her alone. 
Is that why you've been doing all this, Because you think you're protecting her? 
I always have. 
I'm her brother. 
I've got her six. 
Thomas, please tell me what it is that you're protecting her from. 
I can help you. 
No, you can't. 
No one can. 
But if you don't tell me, I'm gonna have to find out myself, And what if i'm too late? 
You stay away from her. 
I'm warning you. 
Why won't you let me help her? 
We all got our secrets. 
Including you. 
Melinda: lucy? 
Can i talk to you for a minute? 
Talk if you want. 
I know ned told you he believes in ghosts. 
I really wish he hadn't done that, Because it doesn't do you any good unless i can prove it. 
Oh, you're gonna prove it to me? 
I will if i have to. 
But i think you already know. 
Really? How's that? 
I think you've felt his presence. 
And i'm not just talking about the weird things that keep happening. 
I want to know why thomas needs to have your six. 
What? 
I didn't know what it meant, So i looked it up, And it's what a fighter pilot says to another When he's covering his tail, "i've got your six." 
How did you know thomas said that? 
Because he said it to me. 
What do you want from me? 
I want to know what it is that thomas is protecting you from. 
Why he is so mad at brad and krista, So that i can get him into the light where he belongs. 
Lucy, please. 
Just tell me what happened Between him and krista. 
Were they seeing each other? 
Did he send those emails? 
Hi. Justin yates. 
Justin who? 
You don't remember me. 
Yeah, why would you. 
Um, ok, uh, blogger? 
In shame of the devil? 
We met after you won that plaque from the town for, uh, saving those kids. 
Ok, smile. 
Oh. 
What do you want? 
Well, i got this really strange email a few hours ago. 
Ok. 
So why don't you just post it on your blog And i'll read it when i get a chance. 
I know my blog isn't exactly cnn.Com. 
But a lot of your friends and a lot of your customers probably check it out. 
And you know how the internet is. 
Once something starts to spread... 
What are you talking about? 
Here. I'll show you. 
This is a video of me rehearsing a fight i had with my husband. 
Yeah, you know, i thought you would say that. 
Uh, the one problem is, The video made my hamster jump on the wheel, you know? 
And, uh, remembered these files I kind of borrowed from professor payne a while back. 
They were encrypted, And i'd given up on trying to decode them Until tonight. 
What's in the files, justin? 
In a nutshell? 
You see ghosts. 
And you believe that? 
Not so much, really, until i noticed Something about the email that the video was attached to. 
Whoever sent me this clip, their computer doesn't have an ip address. 
And in case you don't know, that's not possible. 
Not in this world, at least. 
The world of the living. 
Wait a minute, um... 
What is it that you want, exactly? 
Well, in my business, Usually when someone sends this kind of message, Someone wants you to stop looking Wherever it is you're looking. 
So you just wanted to give me a warning? 
Yeah, and, uh, maybe a little professional courtesy, In case you find anything interesting you want to share. 
Well, thanks... 
For the warning. 
Good night. 
You're welcome Guilty, guilty, i'm guilty! 
What do you want from me? 
I told you i'm guilty! 
What were you thinking? 
Keeping records of things that i said to you, Things that i told you because i thought that you could be trusted. 
And don't even tell me that they were encrypted, Because we both know how little that's worth. 
All right, think back. 
You come to me, i don't know you from adam. 
And all the things that i've been studying and wondering about, And between you and i, starting to doubt, All of a sudden they're real?! 
But why write it down? 
 look, because it was so amazing, I had to make sure i wasn't dreaming it! 
This was huge stuff! 
For you, it's an old hat, But let's not forget that i'm an academic, And you're sweet, kind, caring, Forgiving melinda, right? 
Don't i have an obligation as my job To write down what i observe? 
Remember, you're You're sweet, kind, forgiving melinda. 
Do you have any idea what this could do to my life? 
Oh, come on, melinda! 
What are you afraid of? 
Everyone you help, they already know that you see ghosts! 
I am afraid of people like you. 
Of becoming a case study So that people can understand things That can't be understood. 
And while i'm under that microscope, I can't even help the spirits that actually need me. 
You've really thought this through, haven't you? 
My whole life. 
Hey, ned, what's going on? 
Is that ned? 
Tell him i'm here. 
It's professor payne, ned. 
Put me on Ned, could you please say that again, Because i had someone very annoying distracting me. 
Ned: lucy just told the school she did all those hauntings. 
The scoreboard, the bleachers, The bat in krista's car, everything. 
What? Why would 
she do that? 
It's like she's trying to protect thomas. 
Thomas is a ghost. 
What is she protecting him from, purgatory? 
Wait, will you just call me back if you get anything else? Bye. 
I don't get it. 
Thomas says that he's protecting her, She's acting like she's protecting him. 
What are they protecting each other from? 
Have you asked krista? 
No. She won't return 
my phone calls. 
All right, well, ever since brad confessed, Maybe she has a lot less to hide. 
Hi, krista, i'm melinda. 
I know who you are. 
Um, i've been trying to talk to you. 
Wow. Do you have, like, 
zero comprehension of the word "no?" 
I do, but did thomas? 
Thomas? 
Yeah, i'm not trying to blame you for anything. 
I mean, i'm sure if you hurt thomas' feelings, You didn't mean to. 
No, i didn't do anything to thomas. 
Ok, we had a couple conversations about bats. 
That's it. 
Well, you were writing to each other. 
It's no secret that the two of you were involved. 
I mean, the entire school got that email. 
No, those emails weren't from thomas, ok? 
So just drop it. 
Well, how can you be so sure? 
They weren't even signed. 
Because, i've written back since he died, And... 
I haven't got a response yet, But whoever was writing me opened them. 
So if thomas wasn't writing them, then who? 
I don't know! 
I gotta go. 
Wait a minute. 
So krista's protecting thomas, too? 
Protecting or stonewalling. 
She's insisting those emails were not from him. 
Or maybe she's just embarrassed That she was cheating on her boyfriend with guano boy. 
I'm not calling names. 
I'm just trying to put it in perspective. 
High school perspective. 
So assuming that krista was telling the truth, And if he wasn't writing those emails, who was? 
Maybe there's some clue to who sent them in the emails. 
You're right! 
You're right, that's all we have to do. 
Do you still have that email on your phone? 
The one the ghost was texting everyone? 
Yeah, but it didn't say much. 
That's ok. 
Little blogger friend of mine Taught me that one is all it takes. 
Professor rick payne in apologetic servitude. 
Melinda: good. 
I'm gonna forward you an email, And i need you to use the ip address To track down the location of the computer that originally sent then. 
Can you do that? 
Sure. 
Yeah, i mean i know a geek who knows a geek. 
I knew you would. 
Remember to tell your mom That we did not spend the whole evening talking about ghosts. 
I helped you with your homework, too. 
Yeah, that was intense. 
How much you know about measuring volumes and planes. 
hello? 
Rick: all right, i can get you The internet service provider and the physical address Of the computer's location. 
No user name, though. 
I would need a court order for that. 
Yeah, but you've already got the address? 
Yeah, do you have a pen? 
Uh, yeah. Ok, 
write this down. 
So whoever answers the door sent those emails to krista? 
I feel for him, whoever he is. 
Hi. 
Lucy? 
Yeah, this is my house. 
Are you looking for someone else? 
Not any more Now's not really a good time. 
Lucy? Who is it? 
Dad, this is ned and melinda. 
They're...from school. 
Why don't you come inside? 
Um, we're sorry to bother you. 
We were just hoping that we could talk to lucy for a few minutes. 
What about? 
This is my wife jill. 
This is melinda and Ned. Hi. 
Hi. 
Is this about the trouble lucy's in? 
In a way. 
It's ok. I can talk to them. 
We'll just go outside. 
No, i don't think so, honey. 
Our daughter's all but been branded a serial killer Because some kids reprogrammed the scoreboard. 
Dad... 
I don't believe for a second you did that. 
I don't care what you told the police or your teachers. 
Well, i actually believe that lucy's innocent, also. 
In fact, i know it. 
Why don't we all sit down? 
How do you know that? 
It's about the letters you wrote. 
Emails, actually. 
The ones you wrote to that kid you like. 
That kid? 
There's this girl i was into. 
If you're here as someone concerned About some inappropriate relationships No, actually, we're just here as friends. 
They're here because of thomas. 
Because he wasn't ok with it. 
Not really...anyway. 
Lucy, what are you talking about? 
The night thomas died. 
"Meet me at 8:00. 
"If you can't make it, forget it. 
I've waited too long." 
Signed krista. 
Are you out of your mind? 
Where did you get that? 
You saved it on the hard drive. 
The hard drive that we share. 
It's private. 
Krista eisenberg. 
She is beautiful, she's a senior, And, oh, what's one little key ingredient Missing in your wacky lesbian fantasy? 
She's not gay. 
We were posting on the same blog! 
She responded to me. 
She wanted my email, And she's the one who kept it going. 
But you never told her who you are. 
You never gave her your name. 
She likes me. 
She doesn't even know she's writing to a girl! 
I think she does. 
Oh, why? 
Because of little things that she said. 
Different stuff that you wouldn't understand. 
You can't do this. 
Ok? You're comitting 
social suicide. 
Once she sees you, she's gonna realize that you tricked her, And she's gonna be pissed. 
If she doesn't want to be with me, she can tell me, And i'll handle it. 
Can you handle What she's going to write about you in the slam book? 
What her friends are going to write about you? 
Once you're a target, Everyone's gonna take a shot. 
People that don't even know you. 
They're gonna terrorize you every day. 
For the rest of high school. 
Lucy, we have got to undo this Before it gets out. 
We're supposed to meet. 
I'll go. 
Ok? I'll figure 
something out. 
Ok? 
The whole thing was a set up. 
Forget her. 
Why would krista do that? 
She's the one who kept emailing. 
She's the one who wanted to meet. 
Why would she send brad? 
I don't--I don't know. 
Maybe she got off of Makin' him, like... 
jealous or something. 
Or she thought that, uh, maybe... 
What? 
I don't know, That the whole thing was just kind of a joke. 
But your brother was lying to you. 
Krista never even knew about the meeting. 
What? 
Brad never told her. 
He sent that email himself, But he never told krista that. 
Why was thomas so mad at krista? 
Because... 
He thought she never meant anything she put in the emails. 
He was sure you were getting set up. 
He thought he was protecting me. 
He had my six. 
Mom and dad, i am so sorry. 
I should have never let him go. 
Oh, baby. 
No one meant for it to happen. 
No, the county is not charging brad, And they shouldn't. 
It was all an accident. 
What about all those things that happened at the schl? 
Are you saying you did it because you're angry? 
No, your son was. 
Lucy took the blame for those things Because she was tired of everybody asking what really happened. 
Ok, now i'm really confused. 
But lucy never was confused. 
She knew who she was, and who she loved, And she wasn't ashamed of it. 
And mom and dad were ok with that. 
Just like they were ok with me being the freak kid Who hung out with the bats all day. 
Thomas is here. 
His spirit. 
What are you talking about? 
He says that you loved both of your children Just for who they were. 
They were cool about everything, But they have no idea what it's like now, For anyone who's different. 
They take a few words and, like,oison your whole world. 
He's worried about lucy. 
All the damage that the internet can do, Spreading cruel words around. 
I mean, look at my sister. 
She's pretty, and smart, and funny. 
Everyone likes her. 
No one had to know that lucy was different. 
He's saying that you could have blended in If you wanted to. 
You mean if i chose to. 
In my heart, i wanted her to change. 
But i was the one that needed to change. 
I was just trying to look out for you, But i realize now that that's not what you needed. 
What you needed was me to see you and to love you for who you are. 
He loves you. 
He always did. 
And he doesn't want you to be anything but who you are. 
I love him, too. 
I love you, thomas. 
Come on. 
Do you see the light? 
Not yet. 
I got one or two things to take care of first. 
So now they think somehow That the computer on the scoreboard Looped into the school server, Like it was just some wires that crossed, Messed everything up. 
So thomas set things right. 
That's great. 
Yeah. 
And lucy's off the hook. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, man. She's pissed 
about the ghost thing. 
Do you want me to go talk to her? 
No, it's ok. 
I can handle it. 
Hey, mom? 
Be mad at me, ok? 
Not melinda. 
I'm the one that pushed her to help. 
I'm not mad at anybody. 
I'm just proud of you For wanting to help your friend. 
Lucy? 
She's not really my friend. 
She called me "ted." 
You see, that's what i mean. 
You didn't care what anybody might call you. 
You still stuck your neck out anyway. 
Your sweet, Beautiful neck. 
I used to kiss it when i put you to bed. 
That was just a second ago, ned. 
And now you're all grown up. 
I am... 
So proud of the man that you are becoming. 
Lucy: hey. 
Me? 
Ned, yeah, hi. 
How have you been? 
Good. Good, you know, 
School, life. 
Um, that was a cool thing you did, Telling me about what you believe. 
I know i didn't make it easy. 
Do you want to sit? 
Yeah. Yeah, ok. 
So has your friend seen my brother around? 
No, but he might still be here. 
Usually she sees them cross over. 
Hey. 
Hi. 
I got your email. 
My email? 
Yeah? 
Wait, don't tell me that it wasn't for me. 
This is weird enough already. 
No, i just--I didn't... 
Don't be shy. 
Just admit it. 
The web works in mysterious ways. 
Wow. 
Busted. 
Thanks for all your emails. 
So you knew? 
Not for sure. 
But, um... 
i hoped. 
You did a good thing. 
I worry about her. 
I don't. 
She looks like she has good friends. 
The light... 
What's it like in there? 
I've heard good things. 
But don't go by me. 
Maybe you should go check it out for yourself. 
Justin. 
Oh, uh... 
Hey. Um, 
I'm not stalking you, i swear. 
You said it, i didn't. 
Ahh, did you ever find out who emailed me that video from the security camera? 
Nope. 
It's like you said, no ip address. 
You got your secrets, that's cool. 
It's just, you know, it's hard not ask about the ones i know about. 
Like your travels underneath the town. 
In the tunnels Under our beloved, perhaps haunted, town. 
Is that professor payne's theory? 
Look, i don't want to out you. 
Ok, i know what that could do to your life. 
Why does this mean so much to you? 
Do you have some sort of thing with the other side? 
Hmm. 
When the time comes, Just remember, i kept your secret. 
What time is that?
