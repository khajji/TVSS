What's wrong? 
Keeler. 
He's bringing your ex-husband into this debate. 
The SEC's investigation into his company. 
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust that the people will be able to tell the difference. 
Jack, what's going on? 
Where's Tony? 
He's been shot. 
 How bad? 
 He was hit in the neck. 
He's still alive, they're getting him to the hospital now. 
With Tony down, you're in command. 
Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Van Nuys dam. 
Whoever sent this message is controlling Kyle Singer's movements. 
We have two hours to find him before they release the virus. 
What are you into Kyle? 
These cops, they came to my apartment today and they were saying something about... using me to, 
to bring some weird disease into the country. 
A disease...? 
Go! Run! 
I didn't do anything, man! 
No! Stop! 
 You're going to see Salazar? 
 Yeah. 
My dad said questioning him was a waste of time. 
No. Sitting around here 
is a waste of time. 
Kim, I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document. 
What's this about? 
I need to move Ramon Salazar. 
This has top priority clearance. 
No one at CTU is supposed to know. 
Either I hand over Ramon Salazar or his brother will release the virus. 
I understand that this is an impossible choice. 
I have another option for you to consider. 
Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison and delivered to him. 
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack, but who'll break Salazar out? 
I will, sir. 
This would be my last assignment. 
If you play this cool, Ramon, you're walking out of here with me. 
Open the cell blocks now. 
Let's go. Move! 
The following takes place between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm Good evening to those of you on the east coast and good afternoon to those of you in the west. 
Welcome to first of three debates between President Palmer and Senator John Keeler. 
We'll begin tonight with a two minute opening statement followed by the first question which will go to President David Palmer as decided by a coin flip backstage just moments ago. 
How're you feeling? 
Is that a medical question or a personal one? 
Both. 
I'm fine. 
That will be conducted within formats of rules agreed to by each member of the debate and by the two campaigns. 
Now we will bring to the stage the candidates. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John Keeler. 
David, I'm sorry you have to deal with my ex-husband's lies. 
It's alright. 
We have the truth on our side. 
Ladies and gentlemen, President David Palmer. 
Thank you, John. 
Good luck tonight. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Keeler. 
Good evening. 
I'm looking forward to discussing some of the critical issues... 
When I tell you to, you start fighting with me over the gun. 
I gotta try and pull two guards off the main corridor. 
Okay. They're coming. 
Help! Help! Help! 
That's enough! 
Put on his uniform and helmet now! 
Split up your men. 
I want a team at every security. 
No, Jack and Salazar are somewhere on east block. 
You need to put your men over there. 
I got to control this prison, your partner is not my only problem. 
Warden, today he is. 
He and Salazar need to be contained and they need to be kept alive. 
You want me to redeploy my men? 
Then I need to know how real this terrorist threat is. 
Come here. 
Ramon Salazar's brother will spread a deadly virus into the population unless we release him unharmed. 
If we don't the death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands. 
This is Warden Mitchell. 
Tactical unit five, report to control center. 
You're now under the command of agent Edmunds. 
Thank you. 
 Yeah? 
 Chase, it's Michelle. 
What the hell is going on over there? 
Jack tried to bring Salazar out of prison. 
 He started a riot. 
 What? 
I think in his own twisted way he thinks he's gonna deliver him to Hector and stop the virus from being released. 
Well he's gonna get himself killed not to mention Salazar. 
I know. 
I know, I'm trying to protect him. 
What about Kyle Singer? 
We're getting close to locating him. 
Michelle as soon as you do, call me. 
If Jack knows we got the carrier of the virus he'll give Salazar back. 
We got everyone working on it Chase. 
 We'll find him. 
 Okay. 
I'm sorry, Linda. 
Linda. 
Am I gonna die? 
It depends... 
if they find us in time. 
What do you mean? 
The guy from the government... 
He told my dad that I had a couple of more hours before I... 
Before I become contagious. 
Maybe they'll find us by then. 
You'll be okay. 
Yeah... 
maybe. 
What are you doing? 
There must be some wires in here. 
What do you need wire for? 
To get you out of this. 
Adam. Look at this. 
Got it from a Caltrans server. 
Traffic camera, right near the mall. 
Look at that. 
It's a blue shirt. Isn't that 
what Kyle Singer was wearing? 
Yeah. 
I think there's enough to enhance. 
Release it to my screen. 
Got it. 
 Kim. 
 Yes. 
I need you a second. 
You got this? 
 Yeah. 
 Alright. 
Is something wrong? 
You haven't been following what's going on at the prison, have you? 
No, Adam and I have been working on finding Singer. 
Why, what is it? 
Your dad's trying to break out Salazar. 
What? 
Yeah, he's not out yet but he's acting on his own authority. 
He's trying to remove Salazar by force. 
I don't understand what you mean "by force". 
Looks like he started a prison riot to cover the escape. 
Why is he doing this? 
That's what we're trying to figure out. 
When's the last time you heard from him? 
About a half hour ago. 
He asked me to issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar and he gave me a password. 
And you did it? 
Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved. 
But now you're telling me this isn't true? 
No, Kim. I'm sorry. 
Your dad lied to you. 
Why would he do that? 
Because he knew if he asked anybody else they would know he was violating protocol. 
What's gonna happen to him? 
We're gonna try to find him. 
The best way out of this whole situation is to find Kyle Singer. 
Then your dad will give up Salazar. 
So go back to work, help Adam. 
Yeah, sure. 
We're clear. 
We gotta find all their forces through one entrance to keep the personnel count. 
There must be another way, Jack. 
There is, but the prisoners have taken control. 
We're gonna have to fight our way through them. 
Get ready. 
Hit them up. 
Come on. 
Come on. Get them on their feet. 
Come on, let's go, let's go! 
Move, move it! 
Let's go! 
Hold your fire! 
We have hostages so back off! 
Hold your fire! 
Come on man! 
We can make it through. 
We've got to move. 
Let's go! 
Move! Let's go! 
Go! 
Move it! Move it! 
And in order to do this, our fossil fuels most be conserved. 
Kim, did you send me that Kalman filter? 
What? 
The Kalman filter, I needed to clean up that image. 
Oh, shoot! I forgot about it. 
It's in my help box. 
How can you forget about it? 
It's the only thing you're working on. 
I'm sorry, look... 
I'm sending it to you, right now. 
Done. 
Kim, I don't know where your head is at, but we need to find Kyle Singer before he's contagious. 
Relax! I'm doing the best I can. 
The best I can isn't what we do around here, Kim. 
 It's either done or it's not. 
 So why are you lecturing me, it's in your system. 
Kaufman. 
Is there a problem? 
I just need to make sure things are running smoothly around here... 
Look, Adam. 
I haven't had the chance to brief you but... 
Jack created a situation over at the prison. 
What kind of situation? 
He started a riot to free Salazar. 
Now they're caught up in the middle of it. 
Wow. 
He even used Kim to create a transfer order that started the whole thing. 
So cut her a little slack. 
Umm... 
Yeah, okay, I understand. 
We're all under a lot of pressure here. 
So let's just find Kyle Singer before it's too late. 
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Michelle. 
Kyle, what are you doing? 
There's no way out of here. 
You don't deserve what happened. 
I do. 
If I die�� the virus is dying with me! 
Kyle! 
Kyle! 
Put your feet up here! 
Kyle! 
Kyle, hold on. 
Oh, Kyle. 
A "Welcome Home" party? 
You shouldn't be doing this. 
What are you talking about? 
You've been running things. 
Show Ramon you're gonna be his partner. 
Not his caterer. 
Why do you care? 
You don't want to be involved in my business. 
No, puppy, I care about you. 
And I want you to get what you've earned. 
 Yes? 
 It's me. 
Riot's still going on. 
But we know Ramon's alive. 
Yeah. 
But Bauer's got to get him out soon. 
CTU is getting close to finding Kyle Singer. 
And if they do, they'll never let Ramon go. 
Then make sure they don't find Singer. 
 I'm working on it. 
 Get it done. 
That's him, that's Singer. 
Was that a gun? 
Yeah. 
Someone's got him. 
We're not gonna be able to get the truck's license plate from this shot. 
I'll get access to the traffic cameras in the direction they're heading. 
See if we can find them again. 
 Dessler. 
 Michelle. 
We found Kyle Singer being driven away from the mall, 47 minutes ago. 
Are you working up a vehicle ID? 
We will, as soon as we're able to get any visual. 
This camera's damaged. It's malfunctional. 
Must have the hostages on the right. 
Try and pan the camera over. 
They may see the camera move. 
We don't have a choice. Do it. 
There they are. 
We got to get in there before they start killing everyone. 
Come on! Come on! 
Faster! Faster! 
Let's start wasting the guards unless they let us walk First step outside, bang! 
Headshot from a sniper. 
You don't know that. 
I know, cause that's what went down in Chino They'll let the guard get wasted cause all they care about is keeping us in. 
What the hell are we doing here then? 
Give me your gun. 
Bring them over here. 
We're gonna have a little fun with them. 
Put them on their knees. 
Who wants to live? 
Okay. 
Let's try it again. 
 Who wants to live? 
 Me. 
I do. 
Him. Over here. 
Come on. 
Who else? 
I've never seen you before. 
I'm new here. 
Him. Over here. 
One in six chance. 
You first. 
Please. 
Don't make me do this man. 
There's nothing to it, you little bitch. 
 Just put the gun to your head. 
 I can't! 
I can't... 
You're gonna do it. 
You hear me? 
 You're gonna do it. 
 Please, please. 
It's easy, see? 
All you gotta do is smile... 
and pull the trigger. 
Now it's one in five. 
Let's go! 
No! 
No, I can't... 
I can't... 
 This is a waste of my time. Shoot him. 
 No, wait! 
 Shoot him! 
 Wait! 
Come on, man. 
Just do it. 
This way at least you've got a chance, okay? 
Do it. 
Come on! 
If you're not gonna do it, we will. 
We have a winner. 
Let's hear it for the new guy. 
We're now seeing concrete results. 
This is a road we will continue to travel. 
I got a shot coming in from a camera at the next intersection definitely the same truck. 
Can you read the license plate? 
We won't be able to read anything until it finishes downloading. 
I just saw the IAD inquiry coming over the system about what you're father's doing at the prison. 
They're questioning the transfer you generated for him. 
I heard. 
If you want me to say that you didn't know he was gonna use it to break out Salazar�� I will. 
Thanks. I'll be okay. 
Hold on. It stopped downloading, 
I'm getting an error message. 
Error 402 that... 
means trouble with the internal router. 
Gael. 
What are you doing? 
There's a problem with one of the routers. 
I'm trying to fix it. 
Why don't you call Tech. 
No, it's okay. 
I think I found the problem. 
Checks on circuit kicked in. 
Must have been one of the line surge. 
Should be up and running now. 
Let me know if you have any more problems. 
I will. 
Hey, it's back up. What was it? 
I'm not sure. 
Is it possible a line surge could have knocked out a router? 
Well not from my side, you can ask Chloe? 
Got it. 
Hold on. 
Dessler. 
Michelle, I've got a plate on the pick up. 
Good, where do you last have it? 
The shots on the north part of Santa Fe Springs, it was driving west. 
Okay, I want you to put this out to mobile units LAPD. 
I want everyone looking for this vehicle. 
Okay, right. 
Alright, Ryan, I'm back. 
So do you have any idea if Bauer is trying to break out Salazar on his own or if he is working with someone? 
I'm trying to figure that out now. 
 I'll get back to you when I found out. 
 You do that. 
Chloe? 
Yeah, Michelle? 
Are you following what's going on at the prison? 
I just saw the update come over. 
What the hell's happening? 
We don't have all the details yet but Jack's behind it. 
I need you to check his phone logs, e-mail�� See what case files he's accessed recently. 
What am I looking for? 
Anything that'll help us figure out why he's doing this. 
Are you sure? You really want 
me snooping in his office? 
Yes. 
You got it. 
Surgery? 
Yeah, this is Tony Almedia's wife Michelle. 
 How's he doing? 
 Ah... I'll check. One moment please. 
 Mrs. Almeida? 
 Yeah? 
He's still in surgery. 
You'll be contacted as soon as he's rolled into recovery. 
What room is he in? 
Umm... Operating room 4. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Network ops, Evan. 
 Yeah, Evan, it's Michelle. 
Do you know if we get all our feeds from Good Samaritan? 
Let me check. 
Yeah, they do. 
What do you need? 
See if they're video docu-ing OR4. 
Yeah, they are. 
Where do you want it? 
 Send it to my desk top. 
 Alright. It'll take a second. 
Right, there you go. 
Anything else? 
 No. Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 Four by four. 
 More pressure. 
 Hold that down. 
 I've got it. / There you go. 
Do you have another clamp? 
Clamp. 
The laundry room's a hundred yards in. 
I'll ID the exact locations for the explosives once we get there. 
Yes, sir. 
Sir, we're ready for you. 
Monitor's up. 
You should be seeing it on your IPC. 
 It's working. 
 Okay. 
Alright, let's go. 
Radio silence while we're in there. 
If they hear us, they might kill everyone. 
 Copy that. 
 Yes, sir. 
Let's go. 
Alright! 
Round two! 
Then you. 
I'm a prisoner, not a guard. 
I'm Ramon Salazar. 
 I'm sure you've heard of me. 
 You should pick someone else, he's telling you the truth. 
He's just transferred to cell block less than a week ago. 
I'm a federal agent, I was escorting him out of the prison. 
That's why you've never seen us here before. 
Good. 
Federal agent. 
What's your name? 
Jack Bauer. 
Alright. 
It's gonna be agent Jack against Ramon Salazar. 
A battle to the finish! 
Come on, Jack. 
Show this foreigner how it's done. 
If I die,  my brother will find you. 
 Shut up! 
Do it! 
Alright. 
You're up. 
Looks like your mother's a title, Jack. 
Ramon, stay down! 
Come on! 
All clear! 
Hold your fire! 
Jack! 
Jack! 
I have no triumphs. 
Only defeats. 
God! 
 Lab. 
 This is Chloe O'Brian. 
I'm in Jack's office. 
Could you send someone up the drug kit, please? 
It's on its way. 
The differences on the issues are clear. 
But I believe you don't elect a platform. 
You elect a man. 
And I am frankly troubled by some of the personal choices that this president has made and continues to make. 
We're all aware of the allegations and indictments surrounding the President's former wife. 
Most of us have operated under the assumption that the President will not repeat his history of associating with the persons of questionable moral character. 
However, my office has just learned that the woman with whom the President is currently involved, Doctor Anne Packard is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial. 
A drug which later led to the deaths of three innocent people. 
This is outrageous. 
This debate is not a court of law nor is it a tabloid paper. 
This is neither the time nor the place to launch a personal attack on a private citizen. 
Mr. President 
the Senator still has 30 more seconds. 
Sir, please. 
This is exactly the right time. 
Because I believe the choices your leaders make in their own lives reflect the choices that they will make on your behalf. 
And so the question remains. 
Did the President know of these accusations and choose to ignore them? 
Or is he repeating past mistakes once again? 
Mr. President your rebuttal. 
I can tell you with complete confidence that the Senator's accusation is false. 
And that I believe it is the Senator's way of aborting the issues at hand. 
Now I came here tonight to discuss the real issues pressing our country. 
Oh, god. 
 I assume that the Senator was... 
 Now do you get it? 
I do not believe this is something to be swept under the rug and forgotten. 
It's positive. 
I'll go tell Michelle. 
Chloe, what are you doing in my dad's office? 
Michelle wanted me to go through your dad's stuff. 
Why? 
To find anything that can help us understand what he's doing. 
What's up? 
I wanted to know if a line surge could shut down a router on your side of the ITS room. 
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs. 
Not in my ITS. 
Why? 
Ah, it's probably nothing. 
Did you find anything? 
I can't talk about this. 
Why not, maybe I can help. 
You can't help so just go, okay? 
What's in the box? 
Just stuff I'm taking to Michelle. 
This is really an inappropriate behavior, Kim. 
Why are you doing this, Chloe? 
I mean... 
I'm just trying to help you. 
You can't help. 
And I don't have to have this conversation. 
Under field op mandate, there's a regulation. 
I believe it's 40 or 41 that says that I have jurisdictional prerogative. 
So could you just leave? 
Not until you tell me what's in the box. 
I think your dad's been using drugs. 
 What? 
 That's right. 
Rubber tourniquet, syringe. 
We just had the vials tested of opiates, It was positive. 
He's been acting really weird. Okay? 
It's really not fair you made me do this. 
It's very uncomfortable. 
Michelle? 
I didn't find anything in Jack's records but there is something you need to see. 
You found this in his office? 
I wanted to make sure what it was before I showed you. 
The liquid in these vials tested positive for opiates. 
Probably heroine. 
I think Jack's a user. 
I got it. 
A patrol car just found the truck Kyle Singer was in parked in a industrial complex in Fuller and fourth 2000 block. 
Pipe these into the teams on standby. 
Assume everyone on the site is contagious and use level 1 CDC protocol. 
Let's get him! 
Damn! 
Is there any other way out? 
No, we're pinned in. 
We must have known this could happen. 
What's the plan, Jack? 
Give me the shotgun. 
Give me the shotgun. 
Take off your uniform. 
I have worked the past year with my administration on my overall academic plan. 
The projection could not look better. 
 Dessler. 
 This is Cowgil. 
Approaching the industrial complex on Fuller. 
There are three warehouses on the property. 
I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared. 
Roger. 
Kaufman. 
Adam, see if you can pull up an infrared satellite on the industrial complex. 
On it. 
Kim, log into the NHA server. 
We need to see if they have any satellites in position. 
Kim! 
Okay. 
What's the matter? 
Nothing, I'm fine. 
We just swept these blocks. 
There's no sign of Jack or Salazar. 
Look I got a team in the assault block. 
They can't do a proper search until we lock it down. 
That can take up to a half hour. 
If you want to get out of this thing, you gonna have to trust me. 
And do everything that I tell you. 
You understand? 
Alright. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Okay, here's what I want you to do. 
I want you to take that chopper and I want you sweep the perimeter. 
Chase! 
 What are you doing, Jack? 
 You get these people to move back. 
Or you're gonna have to take me out. 
We need that chopper. 
Don't do this. 
I just spoke with Michelle, we're close to getting Kyle Singer. 
Close ain't gonna cut it this time. 
I gotta deliver Salazar now! 
I'm not letting you go, Jack! 
How long is it gonna take to find Kyle Singer? 
A half an hour? An hour? 
I gotta get Salazar in the air, in that chopper in the next 60 seconds. 
Or hundred thousand people will die. 
 Let him go. 
 Let him go? 
Let him go. 
We'll track the chopper. I need you to 
keep your people under control, Warden. 
Please. 
I can't have anything happen to Salazar. 
Alright. 
This is Warden Mitchell, I want all teams to stand down. 
I repeat, stand down! 
Agent Bauer will take Salazar to the SWAT chopper. 
I want a conformation from all teams on the stand down order. 
Let him take the chopper. 
Stand down. 
Alright? Back off. 
Alright, Jack. 
No one's gonna try and stop you. 
Get these men to back off and holster their weapons. 
Back off! Stand down! 
Let them through! 
Let's go. 
 Get them to holster their weapons. 
 Holdster your weapons! 
 Lower your weapon! 
 Stand down! 
Get the snipers down, off the roof, now! 
 Now! 
 Off the roof! Get off the roof! 
Back off! 
Do what he says! 
We have Singer plus one. 
Center, Singer plus one. 
What's he doing? 
Disabling or calming the locator. 
Yes? 
Chase, it's Michelle. 
We have Kyle Singer. 
I can't hear you. 
We found Kyle Singer. 
 We've got Kyle?! 
 Yes! 
Jack! 
Jack, we found Kyle Singer! 
Jack! 
Jack! Jack! 
Jack!! 
You can talk about facts or figures all night, Mr. President. 
Once again I see this as a question of judgment and integrity. 
Ignore this issue, an issue of rectitude and foresightedness... 
Congratulations. 
Now you are an even bigger enemy to your country than me.
