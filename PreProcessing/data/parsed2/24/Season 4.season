Here are all the access codes for CTU and Division. 
Thanks. 
I'm probably gonna be gone a while. 
If you need anything,you can always call me at home. 
Excuse me,sir. 
Driscoll's replacement's arrived. 
Tony,I want to thank you for filling in. 
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler. 
Who? 
Michelle Dessler, do you know her? 
I used to be married to her. 
I have to go to McLennan-Forster. 
Why there? 
It turns out the man we're looking for works there. 
Need to get into their computer system? 
Yeah. 
Okay,I'll go with you. 
So how can I help CTU? 
One of your employees,a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device. 
We need you to take your I.T. systems off-line 
so Paul can look into his directory. 
CTU will subpoena those files. 
They will find out the truth. 
Damn it. 
what you doing He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted. 
Look at this. 
,... 
that's it.. Print it out,now! Now! 
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists. 
The pulse bomb, we have to use it,now. 
We're dealing with an EMP. 
Once it goes off,everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried. 
I'm going to try and stop it. If I don't, 
I want you to take the hard copy and try to meet me in the front of the building. 
A CTU agent is heading down near you. 
Don't let him anywhere near it! 
Oh,my God. 
the following takes place... 
are any elect only the... 
How many square miles were affected by the blackout? 
Approximately,eight. 
The southeast quadrant of downtown. 
Okay,hold your position until the readings stabilize. 
Any word from Jack or Paul? 
No. Once the pulse bomb went off, 
we lost all communication with them. 
What was the last word we heard from them? 
Well,Jack and Paul found something. 
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster. 
So that's why they set off the EMP,to destroy the evidence. 
That'd be my guess. 
That'd be my guess. 
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action, is evidence against them. 
Yeah,but it's not proof. 
Curtis,could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation? 
No,an EMP only damages electronics. 
But it doesn't mean they're safe. 
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated. 
Where is it? 
It's up to you. 
You decide when the pain stops. 
Call me when he talks. 
no Drop the gun or I'll kill him! 
I said drop it! 
Paul? 
Where's the data printout? 
I hid it... 
in an office down the hallway. 
I know you're hurt, but we've got to get it and get out of here. Let's go. 
It's here. 
Take a seat. 
Where is it? 
Bottom drawer, under some folders. 
I hid it because I thought I might be captured. 
Is this it? 
Yeah,it's in code. 
I couldn't make any sense out of it. 
We need to get it back to CTU. 
I don't think I could have held out much longer. 
You did great. 
Let's go. 
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler. 
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU, effective immediately. 
Tony,I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here. 
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed? 
Yes,sir. 
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third largest defense contractor in the country. 
Now we know that Marwan's been using the alias Harris Barnes. 
What we don't know yet, is how he managed to evade their security checks. 
Marwan knows we're looking for him,so he's probably gone dark. 
But his association with McLennan-Forster has become our primary focus. 
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company to inspect his computer files. 
But as they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's entire database. 
It also fried every electrical device within an eight-mile radius. 
Streetlights,computers,cars, cell phones,everything. 
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation? 
Yes,but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast. 
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated. 
Have rescue teams been sent into the area? 
Not yet. Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided, 
we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics. 
The only problem is,until we find Jack and Paul, they're not going to be able to do much. 
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines. 
But the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster. 
That's all. 
Tony? 
I need the access codes for CTU and Division. 
Thank you. 
Division is sending over a supplemental list of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan. 
I want you to check any names that have been flagged by other agencies,including overseas. 
Given what's happening right now, it doesn't seem like the best use of my time. 
It has to be done. 
And I'd like youto do it. 
Michelle,Jack and Paul have information that could be vital in helping us end this crisis. 
I should be helping us find them. 
Michelle... 
The last time I saw you, you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job. 
That was six months ago. 
This is what I need you to do. 
If you don't like it, you can resign. 
I'm gonna need a security clearance. 
I'll make sure you get a level three. 
A level three? 
I used to have a six. 
Right now,all you need is three. 
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida? 
Not at all. 
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflictson the job. 
I know your history. 
I know that you guys were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life. 
But if this is going to be a problem... 
His being here will not affect my work. 
I won't let it. 
Now,if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to. 
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD, indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked out zone. 
A number of cars have been set on fire, stores have been ransacked, shots were heard. 
There may even be casualties. 
We just don't know at this time. 
Shots were heard? That could be 
the same people that are after Jack. I don't get it. 
What information could Jack have found that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb? 
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster. 
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if there's proof that they helped Marwanwith today's attacks. 
This is Anderson. 
It is time for you to go. 
Marwan,your face is all over the news. 
Don't worry about it. 
Things will proceed as planned. 
Are you ready? 
Yes,of course. 
How long will it take you to get there? 
Less than 30 minutes. 
I'll inform the others. 
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster, and it's not responding to any of our ID requests. 
You sure? 
Yeah,I'm positive. 
Michelle. 
exuse me There's a chopper flying through the dead zone, not one of ours. 
Police? 
No. Not one of theirs either,I checked. 
A chopper that size carries 20 menfully armed. 
Who would have sent it? 
Whoever set off the EMP. 
They're going in after Jack and Paul. 
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years. 
Contact our field teams in the air. 
Let them know about the intruding chopper. 
Jack,I can't do this. 
Don't have a choice. Come on. 
You got it. 
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner. 
Let's move! 
Come on,this way. 
This way. 
Where do we go now? 
Weapons and ammunition. 
Get away from me! Get down! 
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss! 
I'm a federal agent. 
Yeah,sure you are! 
Get away from here! 
Look,we need your help! 
go! now! 
Okay,just relax. 
I'm leaving! 
Okay,I'm leaving. 
Drop the weapon. Now! 
Kick the gun over to me. 
Paul! 
Get in here. 
Pick up that gun. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I am a federal agent. 
Well,you should have been here to help us to stop the looting. 
You still have any rifles or they get them,too? 
Behind the counter Show me. 
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're Arab Americans. 
And we're good citizens. 
We had nothing to do with what happened today! 
Be quiet,Safah. He doesn't care. 
take what you need, but leave us two guns. 
We've chased the looters off once,but they'll be back. 
Just stay there. 
Give me the keys. 
What are you guys doing here? 
We needed to take cover. 
What do you mean? 
Who's after you? 
It has to do with the terrorist attacks. 
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities. 
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout. 
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb. 
It destroys all electrical activity within an eight-mile radius. 
So everything that's happened to us tonight- the looting, the blackout- it's all because of the terrorists? 
Yes,and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks from happening. 
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute. 
Commandos? 
He's right. 
You both need to leave this store. 
Right now,we're their target. 
You're not safe here with us. 
Why don't you leave? This is our store. 
If I had a choice,I would! 
You have weapons and shelter. 
Right now,there is no other place for us to be. 
Can I talk to my brother for a second? 
Stay where I can see you. 
What's the plan? 
CTU knows we're in trouble. 
They also know we can't contact them. 
They can view this area with satellite and infrared. 
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter. 
CTU had to see that on satellite. 
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight, we can force their commandos to use radio frequency to communicate their positions. 
And CTU will pick up the signal? 
yes So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us? 
We have a positional advantage, and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here. 
My brother and I talked about this. 
We're staying. 
I can't force you to leave your own property. 
But this is not just a bunch of looters. 
This is a very dangerous situation. 
You don't understand. 
For years,we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists. 
We grew up in this neighborhood. 
This country is our home. 
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you. 
I agree. The President should stay in the air 
at least another hour, if not longer. 
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One. 
Keep me informed. 
I have an update on the damage from the San Gabriel Island meltdown. 
It's not quite as bad as we had feared. 
How are you doing? 
sit down Any word from Jack or Paul? 
no I can't imagine how hard this must be for you. 
There's something else, isn't there? 
A couple of hours ago, when we thought that Paulwas somehow involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him. 
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted,but... 
Jack was pretty rough? 
Very. 
That's his job. 
He had to make sure. 
You have to believe that Jack had no choice. 
I know,I guess it was just a shock to see it. 
Somehow he seemed like a different person. 
We need people like that, Audrey. 
Jack is an incredible man. Just... 
But you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before,is that it? 
Something like that. 
Could I speak to you for a moment? 
It's important. 
Okay. Um... 
I don't have much time. 
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information earlier today. 
I need people whose minds are on their jobs. Yours isn't. 
Is the back entrance locked? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Put one of these in each window. 
Have extra ammunition standing by. 
Then I want you to get two hunting vests, fill all the pockets with empty clips. Go. 
Ms. Gavin won't be workingwith us anymore. 
...her workload. 
We're stretched pretty thin as it is. 
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already or not qualified to replace her. 
You may want to reconsider. 
No,I don't trust her. 
yeah You'll be working with Agent Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day. 
Edgar,I need you to call up Sarah's protocols. 
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate. 
okay I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes. 
Give me an update first. 
The zone is still pretty quiet,except for emergency vehicle chatter. 
There's no sign of Jack or Paul. 
CTU's tact teams are standing by. 
But the best we can do is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack. 
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is. 
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos? 
It's the most efficient way to be found. 
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive an attack. 
If we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them. 
Do it. 
There's one of them. 
It's time. 
No one fires until I give the order. 
ok Team leader,this is Specter. 
I was just shot at. 
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer,between Flower and Third. 
Audrey? 
yes? 
Could you let DOD know that we've piggybacked onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone? 
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds. 
So you don't need them any more? -No. 
All right,no problem. 
Um,look,I didn't mean to be confrontational before. 
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm, 
you have to be decisive. 
I think that you should re-evaluate your professional opinion of Tony. 
Why's that? 
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn. 
And he went to the one person that he knew would come through for him and that was Tony. 
Tony saved our lives. 
I didn't know that. 
After that,we just spent a couple hours with him. 
It's true,Tony does have a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does, and I think that we could use him on a day like today. 
Thanks. 
Tony,look,I just want you to know that... 
just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input. 
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously. 
Good. 
guys You sure you both want to do this? 
Yeah. 
My brother and I, we're more angry about these attacks today than you are. 
But if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you just as we are. 
Just stay low and do what I tell you. 
Thank you... 
for saving my life. 
yeah They're here. 
Tony,Michelle just said that you were doing a search on possible ties to Marwan. May I help? 
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server? 
In Washington? 
Yeah,it would save me time if I could use it on this search. 
Yeah. 
There you go. 
Thanks. 
Anything else? 
It should kick off a few names. You can help me 
run them down once it's done searching. 
Okay,great. 
So,um... 
did you tell Michelle what happened today? 
I said that Jack called you. 
Anything else? 
Well,I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean. 
She probably already knows that A lot different than Washington. 
Yeah,it is different. 
Are you talking about Jack... 
or yourself? 
I think we found them! 
See those signals underground? 
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency. 
That's because they're planning an attack. 
They converged on a location on Flower and Third, about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster. 
You were right, he's actually drawing them in. 
Sporting goods store, across the street. 
Let's move. 
Bravo One,move in. 
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire at the site of the radio transmission. 
How much longer before our teams get there? 
The ground teams are closest. They'll get there first. 
When? 
At least five or six minutes. 
Who's helping him? 
I don't know. 
They've got to be civilians. 
We need to end this quickly and get that document. 
Is that understood? 
Yeah. I understand. 
Let's go. 
Raji! 
Hey,Raji! 
You okay? Raji? 
Fall back! 
Okay,because of the night vision goggles, if they get within ten feet of you, shine your flashlight in their eyes,it'll blind them. 
ok Jack! 
Jack! 
The gunfire stopped. 
The teams on site? 
Not yet. 
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location. 
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul. 
Get in touch with the teams. 
I'll update Division. 
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight, what about Jack and Paul? 
there is no way to tell CTU personnel are approaching the location. 
CTU,this is Castle, we're about to engage. 
How many hostiles have been sighted? 
Six down outside,unknown number inside. 
Lee,it's Tony. 
Are Jack and Paul still alive? 
Unknown at this point. 
All right,look,the hostiles cannot be allowed to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster. 
Do you understand? 
We'll do the best we can. 
No,Lee,listen to me. 
Failure is not an option. 
That information is what this whole thing is about. 
Roger that. 
Jack! 
Yeah? I'm here! 
You and Raines safe? -Yeah. 
All hostiles are down. We're clear. 
Copy. 
Yeah,Dan. 
No,no,my people will take care of that when we sift through the data. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Jack and Paul are okay. 
What about the information? 
We don't know if Jack has it yet. 
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going to bring us any closer to finding Marwan. 
Well,we know that McLennan-Forster is involved. 
That should yield some leads. 
Well,it's going to have to be worked up here, because McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP. 
You want to head that up? 
all right I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together. 
I need you to get this to CTU. 
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me? 
Jack! Look out! 
Paul? 
Paul? Paul? 
Medic! 
Come on,stay with me. 
Come on,Paul. Stay with me. 
No,no,Paul. 
Paul,stay with me. Come on,look at me. 
Look at me. There you go. 
Look at me. 
I owed you. 
You don't owe me anything. Just stay with me,okay 
Jack,let the medic do the work. 
Any problems? 
What about you? 
I'm leaving now. 
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule. 
We can't be late. 
The San Gabriel Island reactor has just gone critical. 
The core material is now airborne. 
HELLER: I thought we had more time. 
At this rem rate, the radiation will continue getting stronger and will spill into the atmosphere until the core has exhausted itself. 
Son, you've done everything you can. 
Now get the hell out of there. 
Evacuating won't make any difference, sir. 
We've already been exposed. 
Jack has got to find the override before the rest of these reactors go critical. 
I know about you and him and I am not okay with it. 
Look, you and I aren't together anymore. 
PAUL: I thought we were trying to work things out. 
Yeah, I tried. 
But you kept putting it off. 
What did you say to Paul? 
That I'm filing for divorce. 
Somebody set me up. 
ERIN: Thousands of people's lives are at stake. 
Where are the people who control the override? 
Talk to me, Sarah. 
I'm not a spy. 
( gunshot ) Erin, Powell's dead. 
He was hit by a sniper as soon as we took him into custody. 
Did you find out anything from him before he was killed? 
No, but I managed to get the last ten calls he made off his cell phone. 
He called two numbers repeatedly. 
We traced one of them to Maryanne Taylor. 
You're under arrest. 
Don't move! 
Drop the weapon! 
( gunshot ) Listen carefully, Behrooz. 
Government agents found me. 
I made a deal. 
BEHROOZ: I don't understand. 
DINA: You're going to be okay. 
I'm going to help them stop your father. 
You broke my heart. 
If you kill me, Mother will tell them everything. 
If you don't believe me, look outside. 
They're coming to pick me up. 
Drop the gun! 
You'll hit the boy! 
Behrooz! 
Mom! 
That stairway leads to the basement! 
He's got nowhere to go but down! 
Set up a link with CTU now! 
If you can't save my son, I am happy to see the reactors melt down. 
Did you get that? 
( phone ringing ) Driscoll. 
Erin, it's Jack. 
Araz is on the move. 
We're getting ready to move into the hospital now. 
Daddy, you're choking me. 
Jack, it's Jim. 
Bring us up to speed. 
We have a hostage situation involving one of the men that was involved in the terrorist attacks this morning. 
ERIN: I'm pulling up his I.D. now. 
His name is Navi Araz. 
The sleeper? 
ERIN: He was granted American citizenship five years ago. 
Who's the hostage? 
His 17-year-old son, Behrooz. 
He broke ranks and now his father sees him as a liability. 
Araz knows we have his wife in custody. 
He's worried that if he kills the boy, she'll betray him by cooperating with us. 
AUDREY: What does she say? 
ERIN: She's agreed to help us find the override and stop the nuclear meltdowns, if we rescue her son. 
So, the father will stall, keep the kid alive until the reactors blow. 
That's right, sir. 
We've already lost one in California, Jack. 
Can we trust this woman to help us? 
I think right now she'll do everything she can to protect her son. 
Okay, Jack. Whatever 
you need, you've got. 
Just get that kid. 
Yes, sir. 
Erin, I'm going to need a thermal satellite scan of the building. 
We're looking for two heat sources in close proximity, in remote areas of the basement. 
I'll call you back as soon as we have something. 
Yep. 
You're running out of time. 
Save my son. 
Bring her with us. 
We're gonna need her. 
I said get on the floor! 
You're not my son. 
Why? 
Because I don't want to kill innocent people? 
Because you're weak and you stand for nothing! 
I always saw you as something more and now... 
I don't even recognize you. 
Will that make it easier for you to kill me? 
( phone rings ) MAN: Navi? 
Yes, it's me. 
Did you find your son? 
Yes. 
Is he dead? 
Not yet. 
Is there a problem, Navi? 
Government agents have arrested Dina and surrounded the building that I'm in. 
I need the boy for leverage, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold them off. 
Has Dina told them anything? 
I don't think so. 
And she won't, as long as I don't kill the boy. 
How much more time do you need to melt down the remaining nuclear power plants? 
One hour, maybe two. 
Why? 
Why so long? 
The Americans have programmers trying to prevent the meltdown. 
That means we have to manipulate each plant individually, and that takes time. 
I'll hold them off as long as I can. 
I know you will. 
( phone beeps ) Yeah? 
ERIN: Jack, I think we found Araz and his son. 
Where? 
We have two thermal readings in the north wing of the basement. 
What's there? 
Laundry room. 
How many ways in? 
Just one, but according to the blueprints, there's a laundry chute. 
Is it accessible? 
>From the third floor. 
It looks big enough to get a man in. 
Okay, we're on our way. 
We got him. 
Where are they? 
Laundry room. 
This is Bauer. 
I need two teams to the north wing. 
Set up a hard perimeter. 
We're moving to the third floor. 
I need a fast line and a rappelling harness. 
Got it. 
Lee, get me Dina Araz. 
We're putting her into play. 
Where are the latest timing estimates on the remaining nuclear plants? 
Right here. 
These are from 40 minutes ago. 
They update every 15 minutes. 
I'm sorry, Miss Driscoll. 
I've been little upset about my mother. 
You have to put your emotions on hold a little longer, Edgar. 
We're in the middle of a crisis. 
My mother just died, Miss Driscoll. 
I can't put that on hold. 
I'm sorry; that was callous of me. 
But I'm really depending on you now, Edgar. 
Please come through for me. 
I'll get you those figures as soon as we're done here. 
Thank you. 
HELLER: All right, bring me up to speed. 
We're trying to hold off the meltdown process on five nuclear power plants. 
How's that going? 
Our programmers are trying to fight off the override. 
They can slow it down, but they won't be able to stop it. 
Which means we still have to find the override. 
EDGAR: Yes. 
Jack has a suspect cornered at a local medical facility, and we're fairly certain this man he's pursuing is one of the key architects in today's events. 
Can we take him alive? 
Unknown. 
What about Maryanne Taylor? 
I sent Curtis to interrogate her. 
I want to call my lawyer. 
Really? 
I do have rights. 
Yeah? 
Henry Powell had rights, too. 
I don't know any Henry Powell. 
The one who helped the terrorists obtain the override. 
He's right here. 
Want to say hello? 
Bring him in. 
You sick... sick bastard. 
CTU didn't kill him. 
Well, then who did? 
The same people who planted the bomb under your car. 
Whoever they are, they've caught up with you. 
Even if we let you go, you'd be dead in 15 minutes. 
Get him out of here. 
Your only chance to survive is to tell us what you know. 
I want a deal. 
You get to live. 
That's your deal. 
All right. 
Who did you and Powell work for? 
I don't know. 
I only dealt with him. 
Why did he send you into CTU? 
To cover his tracks in case he became a suspect. 
And after Audrey Raines saw him at the warehouse, it became necessary? 
Y es. 
Did Powell work directly for the terrorists, or for someone else associated with the terrorists? 
I told you- I don't know. 
I need names! 
People who can get us to the override. 
I don't have any names! 
But I-I can get them for you. 
How? 
Powell kept a file on his computer at his office downtown. 
It was a... an insurance policy 
in case either of us ever needed a bargaining chip. 
Give me the address and the access code. 
It can't be accessed externally. 
It requires a thumbprint identification either his or mine. 
Since he's dead... 
it'll have to be mine. 
All right, you set? 
TONY: Yeah. 
We think we found them. 
Where? The basement, 
in the laundry room. 
Our satellite picked up two thermal images. 
Then Behrooz is still alive. 
Yes. 
I'm going to need you to distract your husband. 
I'm going to take you down to the basement. 
In one minute, we're going to have you call your husband. 
We need you to keep him on the line as long as possible. All right. 
Let's go. 
Okay. 
You ready? 
Ready. 
Okay, keep going. 
Six feet... 
four feet... 
three feet... 
Stop. 
All right, come here. 
Okay, make the call. 
Remember, keep him on as long as you can. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
It's Dina. 
Where are you? 
Still in the hospital. 
What have you told them?! 
Nothing. 
And I'll keep my mouth shut if you release our son. 
You know I can't do that. 
Then at least promise me you won't kill him. 
Is he still alive? 
Yes... 
and he'll remain alive, as long as you remain silent. 
I have a visual on the suspect. 
The boy is still alive. 
I'm ready to proceed. 
Go. 
Slowly retract the rig. 
I'm in position. 
( metal clanging ) Don't... move. 
Get up slowly. 
Put your hands on your head! 
Stay with her. 
Put your hands on your... 
( grunts ) Hostile's engaged! 
( grunting ) I don't want to have to kill you, but I will. 
Now get up... slowly. 
Interlock your fingers. 
( silenced gunshot ) It's okay, son. 
Just put the gun down. 
It's over. 
It's over. 
TONY: Drop the gun! 
Tony, don't shoot! 
Drop the gun! 
Please, son, put the gun down. 
TONY: Put your hands on your head. 
Hands on your head! 
Turn around. 
Behrooz, are you all right? 
I killed him! 
Your son is safe. 
He's alive. 
We did what you asked. 
Now, where is the override device? 
I don't know that, but I can give you an address where much of the work behind today's attacks was done. 
That's not the deal we made. 
That's all I know. 
I can only tell you what I know. 
What's the address? 
24878 Alvert Street. 
What's there? 
It was a drop-off. 
The place we used to get our final assignment. 
It was the last place I saw the men who were going to take possession of the override. 
When was that? 
Yesterday. 
Send in an advance team. 
Tell them to set up a hard perimeter. 
No one goes in there until we get there. 
You got it. 
What about these two? 
Until we know she's not lying, they come with us. 
So this Maryanne Taylor claims she has to access the file personally. 
Yes, she does. 
And do you believe her? 
I'm not sure. 
The polygraph indicates that she's telling the truth. 
But in my opinion, she may be a sociopath. 
Are you a psychologist? 
No, but I have had dealings with her before. 
Dealings that might affect your judgment? 
No. 
Well, we have to check it out. 
The question is how. 
I can spare an operative from the cyber unit and a security team. 
What do you think? 
I think Curtis should go. 
I need Curtis here. 
AUDREY: The information in the computer file may be important. 
Someone with experience needs to examine it firsthand. 
HELLER: I agree. 
Send Curtis with a security team and you'll have to figure out how to do without him till he gets back. 
Yes, sir. 
I don't like this. 
Either do I, but those are our orders. 
Get it done and get back here as quickly as you can. 
Okay. 
You okay? 
Anything you need? 
I'm fine. 
You understand, Sarah, I had no choice. 
You were identified as a threat to security and I acted accordingly. 
I would have hoped you had more faith in me. 
Personally, I do. 
But the evidence was brought to me by the Secretary of Defense, and I couldn't very well ignore it. 
So what happens now? 
You can go home and rest. 
No one would blame you if you did. 
But if you're up to it, I could use you on the floor. 
The San Gabriel Island reactor went into meltdown less than an hour ago. 
The five remaining plants are critical. 
I need my best people in play. 
I'll go back to work. 
Thank you, Sarah. 
It shouldn't be too complicated. 
Building security is light. 
I have a keycard that'll get us into Powell's office. 
How long is it going to take? 
Five minutes to get up to his office, another five to download the data. 
We're looking at a 15-minute operation time? 
Approximately. 
If I think you're stalling, taking longer than you should, I will take action. 
You got that? 
Raise your leg. 
Don't make me do it for you. 
Curtis, I'm not going to run. 
Then you won't mind wearing it. 
Can I put my foot down now? 
Yes. 
Look, I realize that after today, you have a hard time trusting me, but if we're going to pull this off, you're going to have to... 
I don't have to do anything except retrieve the data your boyfriend had and put you in jail for treason. 
Is that what you really want? 
Without a doubt. 
Curtis... 
Get your hand off me. 
I spoke with Mike at the local D.O.D. office. 
He wants to know who you want to bring in to help manage with their load. 
Things are too unstable for me to leave here. 
I have to keep my eye on tactical. 
Well, I checked with their logs, and they're going to need someone pretty soon. 
How are you holding up? 
I can handle it, if that's what you mean. 
Dad, it'll be fine. 
Why don't you head over there, then? 
I'll call you from there. 
Sarah, you're back. 
Yeah. 
I heard some rumors about what they were doing... 
I'll be all right. 
Just bring me up to speed. 
Sure. 
We're still trying to find the override. 
It's the only way we're going to stop the remaining plants from melting down. 
What have you gotten out of Maryanne so far? 
She claims she has access to a computer that has data on it about the override. 
And which computer is this? 
She's taking Curtis over to it now. 
They let her out of the building? 
Yeah. He's got a security team 
with him. 
And we trust her because...? 
She's trying to cut a deal. 
Agent Bauer. 
Agent Salars. 
Agent Almeida. 
Did you set your perimeter yet? 
Anything inside four blocks is not going anywhere. 
Any activity? 
Not that we've seen. 
Okay, I want to keep this as surgical as possible. 
You, me, and Almeida will be the insertion team. 
Your men will maintain backup. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Go. 
We're clear! 
Dina must have been lying. 
I don't think so. 
She wants to save her son. 
Well, then they must have cleared this place out. 
Bring in a forensics team now. 
I want this place torn apart for fingerprints. 
Yes, sir. 
Tony. 
What is it? 
Go. 
It's clear. 
That's the train they attacked this morning. 
So that's how the terrorists got ahold of the override. 
Jack? 
They planned the kidnapping here. 
Yeah. 
Edgar, the location Jack is searching didn't show up on any agency watch list. 
Yeah, well, I'm having a hell of a time here. 
Why? 
The building is owned by a company that's owned by another company, that's owned by an LLC. 
( typing ) Galaxy Financial? 
I've heard that name before. 
No, Hal, I want you to put that in a separate file. 
We'll handle the kidnapping and the train bombing another day. 
Right now, I only want things that are pertinent to helping us find the override device. 
Okay, I'll have it up on the system when you get here. Okay, thanks. 
( phone rings ) Tony, look, I need to talk to you. 
I'm sorry. 
Just give me a minute. 
Yeah. 
Jack, this is Sarah from CTU. 
Listen, I got something on that address you gave to Edgar. 
What is it? 
The ownership of the building is complicated, but I recognize one of the shell corporations on the ladder. 
Which one? 
Galaxy Financial. 
I never heard of it. 
Neither did I until this afternoon. 
When Paul Raines came in, I was the one who ran his clearance. 
Paul Raines? What does he have 
to do with the company? 
He's a general partner in Galaxy Financial. 
You're telling me that Audrey's husband owns the building that was used by the terrorists to plan this morning's attacks? 
According to this, yes. 
Where's Audrey now? 
She's on her way over to D.O.D. 
Patch her through to me. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah. 
Miss Raines, this is Sarah from CTU. 
I've got Jack. 
Hold please. 
All right. 
Jack, I've got Audrey on the line. 
Audrey, it's me. 
Hey, did you find anything at the address? 
Yeah, the building was used by the terrorists to plan this morning's attacks. 
Jack, that's a great find. 
Yeah, there's something else. 
What? 
The company that owns the building, it's called Galaxy Financial Services. 
Have you ever heard of them? 
No. Should I have? 
Your husband is the chief financial officer. 
What? 
Audrey, the information is true. 
CTU just verified it. 
I need to find Paul. 
I need to speak to him now. 
Paul had nothing to do with the kidnapping. 
Maybe, maybe not. 
But his name is all over the paperwork for the building. 
Because of his relationship to you and your father, he's going to have to explain that. 
Jack, I don't know where he is. 
He left CTU without saying anything. 
Can you reach him? 
What? Yeah, I have 
his cell phone number. 
Okay, I want you to call him. 
I want you to keep it personal. 
I don't want you to tell him what I know. 
I just want you to tell me where he is. 
Audrey, five power plants could still melt down. 
If Paul has any information that can help us stop that from happening, we have to follow through with it. 
You know that. 
All right. 
Please get back to me as soon as you can. 
Okay, I will. 
( phone ringing ) ( ringing continues ) Hello. 
Hey... Paul, it's Audrey. 
I wasn't expecting to hear from you. 
I know, I was just... 
Look, Paul, I-I didn't like the way we left things between us. 
I didn't care for it much either. 
Look, uh, I'm glad you called, but, uh, I'm about to check out. 
Where you going? 
What difference does it make? 
Look, Paul, I was thinking about what you said, about how... we've got 
so much going on for us. 
I thought you wanted a divorce. 
Yeah, I thought so, too, but... 
You know, Paul, today was the first time that we've seen each other in months, and... 
I don't know, maybe it took a while for it to sink in. 
Maybe you're right. 
Maybe there is something there. 
Audrey, you know this is what I want, more than anything. 
Then let me come over. 
I don't want to have the most important conversation of my life over the phone. 
All right, I'm at the Westmore, Room 408. 
All right, I'll be there soon. 
I'll wait for you. 
( grunts ) Okay, no one goes back down there until the forensic team gets here. 
When they do, I want the place torn apart. 
I want fingerprints, trace DNA samples, fiber samples, everything, you understand? 
I understand. 
Okay. 
Hey, I need to follow up on my own. 
I need you to do me a favor. 
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son back to CTU and head up the interrogation. 
Wait a second, Jack. 
They'll never let me step foot in CTU, even if I wanted to. 
Tony, listen. 
You're the only one I can trust to do this. 
Over the last two hours, I watched my friend come back to life. 
It's not that simple, Jack. 
If I press hard enough, I can get you reinstated. 
But I need to know now, is that what you want? 
I don't know. 
Maybe I was wrong. 
You saved the life of the daughter of the Secretary of Defense who happens to be my boss. 
You do know that, right? 
TONY: Jack... 
Thanks. 
I'll do it. 
Lee. 
Agent Almeida will be driving your car. 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
All right, Jack. 
I spoke with Paul. 
He's at the Westmore downtown, Room 408. I'm heading 
over there now. 
No, Audrey! You need 
to let us handle this. 
We don't know Paul's connections to the attack yet. 
He could be dangerous. 
Jack, I don't think we have a choice. 
He was on his way out the door. 
I had to make something up just to keep him there. 
Fine, I can get there instead. 
Jack, I'm only a couple minutes away and he knows that. 
He's not going to stick around if I don't show up. 
Audrey, I know you're trying to help, but I don't feel comfortable with you going in that room alone. 
Jack, it's the only thing that he won't suspect. 
He's been wanting to talk about the marriage all day long. 
Look, I'll keep him there until you get there. 
No, it's not an option. 
Jack, just get there as soon as you can, please. 
Audrey. Audrey! 
Erin, I just got off the phone with Jack. 
He wants me to approve Tony Almeida's reinstatement. 
Do you have a problem with that? 
Considering what Almeida has done for us today, I do not have a problem with that. 
Good. 
Sir, you said you spoke with Jack. 
How long ago was that? 
Ten, fifteen minutes ago. Why? 
We have some new information I'd like to share with you. 
We found a curious connection to the terrorists. 
What kind of connection? 
Paul Raines. 
My daughter's husband? 
One of his companies is listed as the owner of the building Jack just searched. 
The building the terrorists planned the attack from today? 
That's the one. 
Has anybody gone to pick him up? 
We have teams on the way to the hotel where he's staying, but he was about to leave, and the only way to keep him there was under a false pretense. 
False pretense. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Jack called to tell us that Audrey's meeting Paul in his room. Jack's 
on his way over there. 
What?! 
She's going to try and keep him there until our backup teams can take over. 
Unacceptable. 
How could you let this happen?! 
This wasn't my decision. 
This was her choice. 
Jack did everything he could to stop her. 
When did you find out about this? 
About five minutes ago. 
That's when you should have told me. 
Yeah. 
Find out. 
Tell me everything you know about Paul Raines. 
Why? 
What's his connection to all this? 
How should I know? 
Look, Curtis, I wish I knew something that you could use. 
Believe me, I'm quite clear it's my only way out of this, but I don't know any more about Paul Raines than you do. 
How much longer? 
We're about five minutes out. 
Raines's part in all this is being investigated as we speak. 
If your name turns up linked to the kidnapping in any way... 
It won't. 
I am going to do everything I can to find something in Powell's computer that will help you. 
Maybe something about Paul Raines will be on there. 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
What's this I hear about you going to see Paul by yourself? 
It's the only way to keep him here. 
If Paul was involved in our kidnapping... 
Look, Paul would never hurt me. 
There is strong evidence to suggest that he was involved, which means he is dangerous. 
Look, I don't believe he is. 
You don't know what he is, Audrey. 
I've lived with him for eight years. 
I know him. 
Yeah, I thought I knew him, too. 
Audrey, I forbid you to do this. 
Dad, I'm sorry. 
I'm already here. 
Mr. Almeida. 
That's right. 
Erin Driscoll, Director of CTU. 
How are you? 
Uh, this is Mrs. Araz 
and her son, Behrooz. 
Mrs. Araz is in need of 
medical attention right away. 
Have her taken care of and prepare them for interrogation. 
We've told you everything we know. 
We'll see. 
You're going to need these? 
( sighs ) Miss Driscoll, I'm sure you're aware of my history here. 
Not an issue. 
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller both vouch for you. 
That's enough for me. 
Thank you. 
Uh, Jack thought it'd be a good idea if I headed up the interrogation. 
That makes sense. 
You've had the chance to observe them firsthand. 
If there's anything you need, let me know. 
That man I was just talking to is Tony Almeida. 
I want you to keep an eye on him. 
Let me know if he goes off protocol. 
I'm particularly interested in... 
...in any communication 
between him and Jack Bauer or Secretary Heller. 
That's right. 
I'm beginning to see how things work around here, Miss Driscoll. 
How do things work around here? 
You can care less about me being falsely accused and tortured. 
You're beginning to feel squeezed out and you need allies. 
That's why you were so nice to me before. 
We're facing a crisis today, Sarah, and our first priority is to deal with it successfully. 
Is that a problem for you? 
Not at all, but after what I went through today, if you want my help, I need something, too. 
And what's that? 
I want my arrest expunged. 
Not explained by an official letter in my file- expunged, and I want a promotion, two pay grades. 
Done. 
( knocking at door ) Come on in. 
I'm glad you came. 
Can I get you something? 
Sure. 
I had them send up your favorite champagne. 
To tell you the truth, I, uh... 
wasn't sure you'd really come. 
Why wouldn't I? 
You were so adamant before about ending things. 
Your turnaround was just a little surprising, that's all. 
How about you? 
I hardly hear from you for about six months and then you see me with another man and suddenly you're pouring Don Perignon. 
It shows what a fool I am for not realizing what I had. 
It also shows that I still have feelings for you, and you must have some for me, too otherwise you wouldn't be here, right? 
I would hate to think you are playing some kind of game with me. 
I don't play games, Paul. 
Okay. 
To new beginnings? 
New beginnings. 
Miss Driscoll, it's Jack on line three. 
Jack. 
Are the backup teams at the Westmore yet? 
No. They were 
caught up in traffic. 
I'm still a couple miles out. 
If your teams get there first, tell them not to waste time coordinating with hotel security. 
I want them in that room as soon as possible. 
Why not put some fiber optics in place first, get a better position on Raines? 
Because, if Paul's involved, he's gonna be nervous. 
I don't want anything to possibly tip him off before we're ready to enter that room. 
I don't want Audrey in any more danger than she already is. 
Okay, I'll pass that along to Tactical. 
Has Curtis had a chance to question Maryanne about Paul yet? 
She says she doesn't know anything about him, but they're about to get into the computer files. 
That might help us find the override. 
Okay, thanks, Erin. 
It's right down this hall and to the left. 
Stay alert. 
This place may not be as empty as it seems. 
What, you think this is some kind of trap? 
Yes, I do. 
Like you said, Curtis. 
This is my only chance to stay alive. 
I'm not going to blow it, so relax. 
Okay? 
All clear, Curtis. 
This will only take one minute. 
Here it is. 
All I have to do is reformat and then we can download the data and get out of here. 
Paul. 
What? 
The file has a second password encryption. 
Do you know it? 
I think so... 
but it's strange. 
( gunshot ) Take your hand away from the gun. 
Take it away. 
The files are still secure. 
I-I didn't give them anything. I... 
Now put the gun down. 
Put it down. 
Your name is Curtis Manning. 
You work for CTU. 
You're going to tell me how far along you are in your investigation. 
What investigation? 
Of the override. 
Have they discovered where it is yet? 
You're an American and you're working with the terrorists. 
Who are you? 
I'm going to ask you one more time. 
What does CTU know about the override? 
Fine. 
Or... 
I could move to Washington. 
I could turn West Coast operations over to Ben Simon. 
Audrey. 
Yes, I-I heard you. 
Turn West Coast operations over to Ben Simon. 
What do you think? 
I don't know. 
I-I guess you'd have to decide whether or not you thought he was capable of running... 
Not what do you think of Ben Simon. 
Wh-What do you think of me moving back east? 
Oh, um... 
Well, I-I, I don't know. 
I feel like I'm doing all the work here. 
You said you wanted to talk. 
You're not talking. 
These things take time, Paul. 
Well, maybe... 
talking isn't what we should be doing. 
Why are you looking at me like that? 
You're my wife, for God's sake. 
You can't believe that I came over here to sleep with you. 
Okay, you didn't come over here to sleep with me. 
You didn't come over to talk with me. Why did you come? 
I just... I thought that 
maybe we could spend a little time together. 
It would be nice. 
On-on a day like this? 
All hell's breaking loose. 
You thought it would be nice for us to spend some time together? 
Well, I guess I really wasn't thinking when you called, was I? 
What are you doing here? 
What's really going on? 
Are you spying on me? 
Are you doing something worth spying on? 
What is that supposed to mean?! 
I just... 
Maybe I should go. 
I think you should stay! 
Please, just let me go. 
No! 
No! 
Let go of my cell phone. 
Take your hands off of her! 
You set me up! 
Audrey, get behind me. 
Put your hands on your head now! 
Now! 
What do you want? 
I want answers. 
Well, I'm not talking to you.

Why? 
Because I don't want to kill innocent people? 
Because you're weak and you stand for nothing! 
Is there a problem, Navi? 
Government agents have arrested Dina and surrounded the building that I'm in. 
How much more time do you need to melt down the remaining nuclear power plants? 
One hour, maybe two. 
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will. 
I have a suspect in custody. 
I need assistance. 
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son back to CTU and head up the interrogation. 
Wait a second, Jack. 
They're not going to let me set foot in CTU, even if I wanted to. 
If I press hard enough I can get you reinstated, but I need to know now: Is that what you want? 
Ms. Driscoll, I'm sure you're 
aware of my history here. 
Not an issue. 
Jack Bauer and secretary Heller both vouch for you. 
That's enough for me. 
Did Powell worked directly for the terrorists? 
I told you, I don't know. 
I need names, people who can get us to the override. 
This place may not be as empty as it seems. 
What, you think this is some kind of trap? 
Yes. 
I do. 
I didn't give him anything. 
I... 
What does CTU know about the override? 
Audrey, it's me. 
Hey, did you find anything at the address? 
Yeah, the company that owns the building, it's called galaxy financial services. 
Have you ever heard of them? 
No, should I have? 
Your husband's the chief financial officer. 
What are you doing here? 
What's really going on? 
Are you spying on me? 
Are you doing something worth spying on? 
What is that supposed to mean?! 
Take your hands off of her! 
You set me up! 
Put your hands on your head now! 
What do you want? 
I want some answers. 
The following takes place between 5:00 p. m. and 6:00 p. m. 
I think it would be better if you left the room while I question your husband. 
You can wait just outside with the backup team. 
What are you going to do to him? 
Whatever I have to. 
I'm staying. 
Fine. 
Look at me, Paul. 
Look at me! 
I've got nothing to say to you. 
This is what you need to know, Paul. 
There are five nuclear power plants ready to melt down. 
All I care about right now is making sure that that doesn't happen. 
Your name is on a lease in a building in chatsworth that was used by the terrorists to plan today's attack. 
That makes you a prime suspect. 
I'm going to treat you like one. 
Do you understand that? 
My name is on at least 50 different leases. 
I own ten different corporations. 
I don't know anything about some building in chatsworth. 
I don't believe you. 
The lease of that building was notarized. 
There's documentation of your id. 
Ctu verified your signature. 
Paul, you need to start talking to me now. 
I've got nothing to say to you. 
Jack. 
I don't think that Paul would be a traitor to this country. 
Right now Paul is a prime suspect, and he's not cooperating with me and I don't have time to do this any other way. 
I need to know for sure. 
Paul... 
this is the last chance you've got to talk to me before I have to hurt you. 
Tell me about 24878 alvert street in chatsworth. 
Why's your name on the lease? 
Jack, please. 
Audrey, don't interfere! 
If you need to step outside of this room, do it. 
Why is your name on the lease? 
You're bluffing. 
I need that information, Paul, I need it now. 
Come on, Paul, just tell me. 
What's your connection to the terrorists? 
Jack? 
Please, don'T. 
All right, all right, all right. 
I-I-I don't know the specific building you're talking about. 
I can find out. 
How?! 
My corporate records are stored on my laptop. 
If that address is under my name then it'll come up. 
Maybe there's someone else involved I don't know about. 
What's your user id log-in number? 
It'll be much quicker if I just do it. 
Please. 
You want me to believe that you're not involved with this, Paul? 
You better show me who is. 
I'm sorry I had to call you here, Marwan, but I had no choice. 
Ctu is trying to disable the override, using a drinfeld module. 
They've already shut down over 90 reactors. 
We always knew they'd stop some of them. 
The important thing is that one of the reactors has melted down. 
As long as the override has control of the other five, I can do the rest from here. 
Everything is ready for you upstairs. 
Will anyone in that office be suspicious? 
I've reported a system failure. 
If anyone asks, tell them you're from it restoring my hard drive. 
My desk is in the last row, three from the end, seat 86. 
The override is well disguised inside the desk. 
Here is the key. 
Good. 
How much time will you need? 
45 minutes to melt down the remaining reactors. 
I'm here if you need anything. 
Where is the CTU agent? 
Forbes is questioning him now. 
He's out. 
He's not going to tell us anything. 
What does Marwan want us to do with him? 
Finish him off. 
Then get rid of the body. 
Take care of it. 
He came with a woman and two other agents. 
Where are their bodies? 
They're already in the van. 
Yeah, here it is. 
Galaxy financial services. 
What kind of a company is it? 
It's, um, a failing payroll service I was about to dissolve, and someone came in with an offer to buy 51% of the shares. 
Seven, 800 grand, something like that. 
Here- Harris Barnes, director. 
Who is Harris Barnes? 
I, uh... don't remember. 
What do you mean you don't remember? 
I'm involved with over 30 companies. 
I don't deal directly with most of them. 
Explain to me, Paul, how your name got on the lease. 
I don't know. 
You expect me to believe that you entered into a business deal worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with someone that you'd never met? 
Yes. My attorney handles most of the... 
Paul, I don't believe you! 
Jack, it's possible. 
Paul has put together a lot of deals through his attorneys. 
This is Sarah. 
Hey, it's me. 
I need you to run a name for me. 
Go ahead. 
Harris Barnes. 
He's the director of a cAlifornia corporation- galaxy financial services. 
What am I looking for? 
Where he lives, his businesses, anything that could possibly connect with any terrorist activity. 
All right, give me a minute. 
I'll be here. 
She's calling me right back. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, your boyfriend is just a thug with a badge. 
Paul, why is your name on that lease? 
Unbelievable. 
An hour ago, I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself that you didn't want me back. 
And now... you think I'm a terrorist? 
You think I had something to do with you and your father's kidnapping? 
I don't know what to believe anymore. 
Yeah? 
Okay, I ran down the name Harris Barnes, and a lot of data came up, but it was inconsistent. 
So I went into the irs records and found out that Harris Barnes didn't appear on their logs until two years ago. 
So it's an Alias. 
As far as I can tell it's a washed id, with a vAlid social security number and credit card history. 
Interpol back-traced a name and provided a list of foreign nationals who've used it in the past. 
Who used it most recently? 
A man named Habib Marwan. 
Okay, we need to find him. 
I think we already have. 
What do you mean? 
Marwan used the name Harris Barnes to lease more office space here in L.A. 
It turns out the same address was given to us an hour ago by Marianne Taylor. 
She and Curtis are there now. 
What's the address? 
It's the 29th floor at the Rockland building downtown. 
Okay, I'm on my way. 
As soon as Curtis calls, you patch him through to me. 
You got it. 
You think Marwan's there? 
Right now, it's our only lead. 
If he is, that's where the override is. 
I'll get back to you. 
I want you to tell me who's still out there. 
I want the name of anyone who can help us find that override to stop the plants from melting down. 
My husband kept all of this from me. 
I only helped. 
That's a bunch of crap. 
Now, we know you were just as involved as your husband. 
Listen, we're quite aware that the only reason you're helping us is because of your son. 
But believe me, it's not too late for us to change our minds about how we treat him. 
There are a few men whose names I heard Navi mention. 
They might know what you want. 
But I don't know how to find them. 
All right. 
Why don't you start by writing the names down? 
As far as we can tell, this Habib Marwan's been controlling the override. 
Jack's on his way there now? 
Yes. 
Curtis and his team are already at that building. 
I know, but we haven't been able to reach him or his team members. 
He's not answEring his cell. 
How far is Jack? 
About 15 minutes out. 
Keep trying Curtis. 
Tell him Jack's on the way. 
We have to coorDinate the two and find that override. 
Okay. 
Tony? 
Ask her about a man named Habib Marwan. 
Who's Habib Marwan? 
I heard Navi speak of him a few times. 
He's an engineer. 
Beyond that, I don't know. 
Miss Driscoll? 
Yes? 
This is Alison Lackey at the clinic. 
There's a problem with your daughter Maya. 
I think you should get down here as soon as you can. 
I'll be right there. 
Thank you. 
It's the CTU agent's phone. 
What should we do? 
Nothing. 
Let them wonder where he is. 
By the time they reAlize what's happened, it will be too late. 
Find out if Adam and Jason have disposed of the body. 
They should have been back by now. 
All right. 
Yeah? 
Ali, Adam and Jason are dead. 
Did the agent escape? 
No, the door's still armed. 
He's still on this floor. 
 Find him. 
 Yeah. 
Yes. 
The CTU agent is loose on this floor. 
How did he escape? 
He killed two of our men. 
Does he know the override is in the building? 
I don't think so, and he can't get to it. 
We have the exits covered. 
Disconnect all the hotlines. 
He can't be allowed to contact CTU. 
I will. 
No, no, no. 
You can't keep me here! 
Maya, please. 
We just want to help you feel better! 
I'll feel better when you get out of my face! 
Maya! 
What took you so long? 
I thought she was given a sedative. 
We did. 
She's fighting it. 
Give me a few minutes with her. 
Sure. 
Nurse. 
Honey. 
Honey... I brought you here 
so that you could be near me. 
Isn't that what you wanted? 
I want for us to go home. 
Maya, we will, honey, but we can't just yet, honey. 
I don't like these people here. 
Maya, Maya, that's not going to make you feel better. 
You're wrong. 
I do feel better. 
 Sweetheart, I need you to... 
 Go, get out! 
You're such an important person, why don't you take care of your important business? 
 Maya... 
 Doctor? 
Doctor?! 
Doctor? 
Yes, Maya? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
I was misbehaving. 
But I promise to be good. 
If you'll just get that out of here. 
I'm going. 
I'm going. 
Bye. 
I'll be in my office if you need me. 
Come on, Maya. 
Curtis's phone is ringing, and he's not answEring it? 
Right. 
It rang several times before I got his message. 
If he had turned it off, it would have gone to voice mail immediately. 
He's in trouble. 
Where are the field teams? 
Castle and his men will be there in two minutes. 
I can have them set up a staging area along the perimeter and stand by for your command. 
What's the probability that Marwan's even in the facility? 
We don't know yet. 
Where are they staging? 
They'll be waiting for you in a parking lot at the northwest corner of wilshire and grand, one block away. 
Okay. 
Have your people found Marwan yet? 
No. 
Audrey, you, you have to know that I would never be involved in anything that could bring you harm. 
Of all the people this Marwan could approach to do business and he chose you? 
It's a hell of a coincidence, Paul. 
It might not just be a coincidence. 
They might have wanted Paul for more than just the corporate shell. 
He chose Paul because he was my husband? 
That would put them one degree of separation from your father. 
So this Marwan used me to get to Audrey's father. 
It's a possibility. 
Well, I had no idea where Audrey or her father would be today. 
The information they used to stage the kidnapping couldn't have come from me. 
They would have used your relationship with her father for something else. 
Maybe to plan something for the future, a contingency plan. 
I've been careless. 
I'm so sorry. 
all right, well, so far every name Dina's given us has checked out as a mid-level cell member. 
But what's interesting is that Marwan, who she claims to have never met, is connected to everyone on this list. 
It looks like all roads lead to him. 
This must be his operation. 
Which means she definitely knows more than she's telling us. 
What do you want to do to make her talk? 
I just need you to give me a little bit of rope. 
Do it. 
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan? 
I already told you. 
No, you told me you never met him. 
I haven'T. 
Danny, could you come in here, please? 
I'm going to need all video and audio monitoring in this room disconnected. 
Thank you. 
I'm not a stupid woman. 
What are you trying to prove with this? 
I'm not trying to prove anything. 
I just don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded. 
I don't believe you. 
Open the door! 
Everybody out. 
Get out, now! 
Everyone, Erin. 
Unless you tell me the whole truth right now, that deal you made to save your son is over! 
And he goes to prison for murder and treason! 
You can't do that. 
The president signed an agreement. 
If that deal gets in the way of protecting this country, you think the president's gonna stand behind it? 
He's gonna tear it up, and your son goes to prison for the rest of his life. 
Let me tell you, I know a little something about prison. 
And based on the conditions of his confinement, I can tell you right now, I give behrooz about three months before he commits suicide. 
And by the way, I'm going to make it my personal mission to make sure you never hear word one about what happens to him, ever! 
Wait. 
Habib Marwan is the man our cell reported to in the united states. 
You said "your cell. " 
How many other cells reported to him? 
I don't know. 
But there are others? 
Yes. 
How many? 
I told you, I don't know. 
The cells are not in contact with one another. 
Marwan thought it was safer that way. 
What about the override? 
Is it in his possession right now? 
Definitely. 
Definitely? 
Why definitely? 
Your programmers are trying to interfere with the meltdown sequence. 
Marwan is the only one capable of stopping them. 
And he's trying to do this by controlling it directly? 
Exactly. 
Where? 
Where?! 
Somewhere in downtown. 
The rocklyn building? 
Yes. 
Sarah Gavin. 
Sarah, get me Jack Bauer on the phone. 
You got it. 
Place her back in holding. 
Erin, Dina just confirmed Marwan's got the override. 
He's at the rocklyn building. 
Everyone, listen up! 
The address where Curtis is and where Jack Bauer is heading, is the location of the override. 
I want every station to focus on this location. 
I want field teams ready. 
Rework your assault tactics on the building factoring in this new information. 
Let me speak to Tony. 
Hold on a second. 
Tony. 
I've got Jack. 
Jack. 
Yeah? 
We have confirmation: Habib Marwan is controlling the override. 
He's at the address you're headed to. 
What about Curtis? 
No, we haven't been able to reach him yet. 
Have you changed the assault profiles? 
We're working on it. 
Look, Marwan's the key to this. 
He can't know we're coming or he'll take off with the override. 
Also, we're running out of time. 
We've got about 20 minutes before these plants start to melt down. 
Okay, tell Castle to prep for a low-profile assault. 
Tell him I'm on my way. 
Copy that. 
Get me Castle. 
Ali? 
Go. 
Have you found him yet? 
Marwan, it was not necessary for you to come down. 
Not necessary? 
We will find him. 
If I'm captured, it'll end everything we've been working for. 
We control the floor. 
He can't get far. 
Don't tell me what he can't do. 
He's already killed two of our men. 
What is it, Forbes? 
Tell me you've got him. 
No, I'm sorry, Marwan. 
He may have gotten away. 
How is that possible? 
Ali says the floor is locked off. 
I know. 
We're still searching. 
But we've got to deal with ventilation, air ducts, ceiling space... 
I don't care how you get him, as long as he's contained. 
I need 30 minutes. 
Can you make that happen? 
I can make it happen. 
30 minutes. 
Who's Marwan? 
Who is he? 
Does he have the override? 
Does he have the override? 
Yes. 
Where is he? 
Where is he? 
One flight up. 
I don't have access to the floor. 
Ctu Sarah Gavin. 
Sarah, it's Curtis. 
Where's Driscoll? 
Where have you been? 
We've been trying to reach you. 
I'm still in the rocklyn building. 
Sarah, listen. 
Maryanne's dead, I'm sure our backup teams are dead, too. 
The override is here. 
Uh, Jack's on his way to you now. 
Jack? 
I need you to put together a security detail for Paul and Audrey Raines now. 
I'll take care of it. 
I want you to stay here with these men until I get back. 
Are you going in? 
Yeah. 
One second. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's manning. 
Where are you? 
I'm still in the building- 29th floor. 
Where are you? 
I'm in the staging area about a block away. 
Have you secured the override device? 
No, but it's here, on an upper floor. 
A man named Marwan is in control. 
I know, CTU worked up a partial profile. 
What's your mobility? 
Limited. 
They're still looking for me. 
But I took an access card off one of the hostiles. 
How do we meet? 
Take the main elevator. 
There's only one guard posted there. 
I'll take care of him. 
I'm on my way. 
We've got Marwan boxed in. 
I want you to send in your team, reinforce the perimeter. 
I want men on the first floor in case this thing goes hot. 
Got it. 
I'll be right back. 
Go, go! 
That was our field agents from the rocklyn building. 
Your daughter's with them now. 
She's safe. 
I don't want her anywhere near harm's way. 
She won't be, sir. 
I understand we're closing in on the override? 
We hope so, sir. 
We believe we've found where the terrorists have it. 
Which is where? 
In an office building in L.A. 
We believe the terrorists are either associated with one of the tenants, or they've created a corporation they're hiding behind. 
How is CTU proceeding? 
We have teams converging. 
Once we find the override, we have to use it to reprogram the reactors manually. 
Will there be enough time to reprogram? 
Our people will be ready, sir, once we find it. 
All right. 
I don't have to remind both of you of the consequences if we fail. 
Everyone here understands what's at stake, sir. 
Excuse Me, Miss Driscoll? 
Dr. Sanford's on line two. 
Excuse me, sir. 
I'll meet you on the floor. 
Yes, doctor? 
I'm sorry to bother you, but Maya's acting out again. 
What is she doing? 
She's being abusive to my staff. 
She's broken a few things. 
If she doesn't settle down, I'm going to have to move her to a private hospital. 
We're not equipped to handle a patient like Maya. 
All right, don't do anything. 
I'll be right there. 
Sarah? 
Excuse me. 
Is Edgar still online with NRC? 
Yes. 
They found any alternate ways to stop the meltdowns? 
Not without the override, no. 
What's happening at the rocklyn building? 
Castle just called in. 
His teams are spread out on the perimeter. 
What about Curtis? 
He's about to meet up with Jack inside the building. 
Okay, where are you monitoring? 
Station three. 
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. 
Make sure everything's ready and calm if Jack and Curtis get their hands on the override. 
OK. 
You're a cruel person. 
Do you know that? 
Maya, please. 
This is a restricted area. 
You have to stay in your bed. 
Stay in my bed? 
What am I, a baby? 
Maya! 
What do you want, mother? 
Don'T. 
Please, don't treat these people disrespectfully. 
Please don't tell me what to do! 
I'll stop telling you what to do when you stop behaving like a child. 
What? 
You heard me. 
There are other people in this world besides you and they have problems, too. 
Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself or am I going to have to call security and have them restrain you? 
You're pathetic, you know that? 
I will not allow you to talk to me like this. 
I will not! 
What are you going to do about it? 
I... 
I just want to get out of here, mommy. 
And I will take you home, but I have something I have to finish first. 
 No... 
 It's okay. 
Are we clear? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
That's my girl. 
We've got a man down. 
Take the wall. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I overheard a phone conversation between Marwan and one of his men. 
We have less than 15 minutes. 
How many are still Alive? 
I'm not sure. But at least four. 
Have your men secure the floor. 
Curtis and I are going after the override. 
Which way? 
This way. 
What about backup? 
No backup- we can't let Marwan know we're coming. 
What's upstairs? 
Ids data systems. 
My guess is Marwan somehow inserted a sleeper into the company. 
They must have used their servers to download the virus into the nuclear power plants. 
By piggybacking on ids hardware. 
Yeah. 
Take the door. 
All right. 
Clear. 
Step away from the door, ma'am. 
I need you to exit the building. 
It's an emergency. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Did you get a description on him? 
No. 
It could be anyone. 
Hey, bob, what's going on? 
Yes? 
Marwan, it's Ali. 
We've been discovered! 
Ali? 
Make sure all the exits are covered on all floors. 
Roger that. 
Last man down. 
Curtis! 
Stay down! 
Stay down! 
I got this exit! 
You got him? 
No! 
Jack, I have the override! 
Secure it! 
Call CTU now! 
Now! 
I got him! 
Driscoll. 
Erin, it's Curtis. 
I have the override. 
Put Edgar on. 
Edgar, line one. 
It's Curtis. 
He has the override. 
This is Edgar Stiles. 
Is the override logged in? 
Yes. 
Send it to channel 11. 
I can'T. 
What do you mean you can't? 
All the fields are write-protected. 
It's not supposed to be. 
If you're directly plugged into the override, you should be able to do anything you want. 
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's locked up. 
What do you want me to do? 
Miss Driscoll, the clinic just called. 
Tell them they're going to have to wait. 
 They said it was an... 
 Tell them! 
Edgar, we're out of time. 
If you're going to do something, do it now. 
Marwan was the engineer on the project. 
He must've modified the override to do this. 
The NRC screen is showing the meltdown stage is already beginning. 
Edgar, do something! 
Curtis, there must be a hot key. 
There's a lot of keys, Edgar. 
I can't just try random combinations. 
It'll take too long. 
Press the function keys one at a time. 
The status window on the bottom will light up when you get to an active one. 
F5. 
Good, hold it down and press "escape. " 
Nothing. 
Try F5, shift, Escape. 
Okay, it's responding. 
Good, set it to channel 11. 
Hurry up. 
Edgar, now they have three plants in meltdown initiation. 
Did you get it? 
I hope so. 
It's starting to respond. 
Yes! 
The temperature is dropping on all remaining power plants. 
Good work. 
Congratulations, Edgar! 
Great work, Erin. 
Thank you, sir. 
Excuse me. 
Maya? 
Where is she? 
Maya? 
Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh, baby... 
Oh... 
It's over, sir. 
We've stopped the meltdown. 
This is Bauer. 
We got a man down. 
Marwan is in the northwest stairwell headed to ground level. 
Does anybody read me? 
Jack, it's Castle. I'll get man up there. 
All CTU agents: Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer. 
I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer. 
Solaris, do you read me? 
Solaris, do you read me?! 
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail. 
Just like everything else you've tried today. 
Almost 40 dead in a train crash, many more near the San Gabriel Island Nuclear Plant. 
We managed to stop the other 103 power plants from melting down. 
That's what America will remember  that we stopped you. 
No, this country will forever be afraid to let their leaders appear in public. 
For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well. 
Marwan... 
The police report file has been distributed. 
In the next few minutes, CTU will be alerted that the military pilot and his family are missing. 
What do you think we should do? 
We have to make sure CTU is too busy to realize its significance. 
Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody. 
I will return him to you unharmed in exchange for Behrooz Araz. 
He'll be overseeing the operation. 
BILL: Let's talk about what happens if we don't agree to the exchange. 
We don't get Jack Bauer back, for one thing. 
That can't be the deciding factor here. 
Well, most importantly, if we don't go through with this exchange, we may lose an oportunity to trap Marwan. 
Is my mother in the van? 
She was working with you. Where is she? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't want to die. 
( gunshot ) I got their sniper. 
Let's move out. 
Why'd you give them the kid?! 
It's okay, he's been double tagged. 
We'll be tracking him. 
BAUER: I managed to short-circuit the phone lines in the building that I was being held. 
If you can find two service obstructions at the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan. 
( beeping ) We have a location where Marwan was holding Jack. 
( ringing ) Yes? 
There'a problem. 
Just as I was about to do a preflight check, they grounded the plane. 
Resolve this now. 
Did you make your report to the chief mechanical officer? 
I was just about to head over there right now. 
Don't let me hold you up. 
( silenced gunshot ) It was just a false alarm. 
All right. 
I'll clear it for takeoff. 
We placed multiple trackers on Behrooz Araz, but those are no longer transmitting, which means that Marwan's men found and destroyed them. 
Are you close to finding Marwan? 
We may be, sir. 
Jack Bauer managed to tag the location where he was being held. 
We're preparing to mount a raid on that location as we speak. 
I want Marwan found... now. 
I've asked Secret Service to secure a landing site so I can be on the ground to address the nation before the 11:00 news. 
Sir, we believe that you're safer in the air right now. 
I have been flying for 20 hours. 
The American people need to hear from me now, not tomorrow. 
Then may I like to suggest you do it from Air Force One? 
It may not be optimal, but at least you'll get your message across. 
I appreciate your concerns, but I'm going to give my speech when I get to Los Angeles. 
I'll inform the press corp, give them enough time to notify their outlets. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Just make sure I'm briefed on Bauer's progress before I go on the air. 
Of course. 
What's Jack's status? 
His team just arrived at Marwan's location. 
They should be in place in a few minutes. 
CHLOE ( over phone ): CTU Com. 
This is Bauer. 
Strike teams are moving into final positions. 
We're about five minutes out. 
How are you on your end? 
We're coordinating backup teams, we have building plans on line. 
 Chloe? 
 Yeah, it's me. 
 Michelle brought me back in. 
 Good. 
Are the satellites in position? 
Yes. We've been 
monitoring the area for the past five minutes, but there's been no activity. 
How's Paul Raines doing? 
Is he still in surgery? 
Uh, no, he just got out. 
Chloe, I'm glad to have you back. 
We're going to need your help. 
Look, is Audrey there? 
I think so. 
Let me speak to her. 
Hold on. 
( cell phone ringing ) Hello. 
Audrey, I have Jack on the line. 
Are you there? 
Yeah, I'm here. 
Hold for Jack. 
O kay. 
JACK: Audrey? 
Jack... you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
How's Paul doing? 
They just finished operating, but they said that he's going to make it. 
I'm waiting to talk to the doctors. 
Good. I'm glad. 
Look, Audrey, I know we have to talk about how I handled everything with Paul. 
Yeah, we do. 
It's just... 
It's really hard right now. 
Yeah, I-I understand. 
Are you still out in the field? 
Yeah. We're getting ready 
to move on Marwan. 
Be careful. 
Yeah, I'll call you as soon as it's done. 
Yeah... right. 
I just got off the phone with DOD. 
They want to know what our status is. 
Jack's team has been deployed to Marwan's location. 
He should begin the assault any minute. 
Did you get a read on how many hostiles are inside? 
Based on the infrared scan, we counted eight. 
BILL: Did we pick up voice transmission that could indicate that one of them is Marwan? 
No, but we know he was there 25 minutes ago when Jack left the building. 
If the information on that hard drive is discovered by the Americans, it will jeopardize the next phase of our plan. 
Well, it's not here. 
No, you haven't looked hard enough. 
I've been searching for almost an hour. 
Aziz told one of his men he hid a backup copy of those files in his apartment. 
Well, why didn't Aziz tell you where he hid it? 
Because he was killed before he could tell me. 
Look, Anderson shared this apartment with Aziz Maybe Anderson knows where the hard drive is. 
Keep looking. 
I'll try to contact him. 
Bravo three-niner in the air, heading 55-2. 
AIR TRAFFIC: Roger, Bravo three-niner, you are cleared for 3-5 thousand feet. 
Bravo three-niner, ascending to 3-5 thousand feet. 
( beeping ) I'm in the air. 
I should reach the target in 45 minutes. 
We have a problem. 
What kind of problem? 
Aziz, he hid a backup copy of his files in your apartment on hard drive. 
We haven't been able to find it. 
Ask Aziz. 
Aziz is dead. 
I don't know about a hard drive. 
You have no idea where he might have kept it? 
If I knew where it was, I'd tell you. 
( fizzing ) I'm not trying to get myself killed. 
I'll get back to you. 
Okay, in order to flush Marwan out, I want you to lead your men down the main corridor. 
He'll try and escape through the left flank. 
That's where I'll find him. 
Tac team's ready to go in on your word. 
Have they set the charges on the door? 
Yes. 
Gentlemen, we are a go. 
We've got a green light. 
Teams A and B, move into position. 
All teams, move in on target. 
Prepare to ignite charges on my mark. 
JACK: Three, two, one. 
Blow the door! 
( gunfire ) Go! Go! Move! Move! Move! 
Delete the files! 
Delete everything! 
( rapid gunfire ) ( two gunshots ) ( grunting ) ( gunfire over speakers ) ( rapid gunfire ) ( gunfire over speakers ) ( rapid gunfire ) Hold your fire! 
Clear! 
Marwan's not here. 
Notify the perimeter. 
Team One and Team Two, come in. 
Marwan is not in the building. 
Maintain your perimeter. 
Come on! 
I can't stop this thing from deleting. 
This doesn't make sense. 
This room's hot. Get your 
men out of here! 
Get your men out of here now! 
Jack, what's happening? 
What's going on over there? 
 You OK? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
Check your men! 
Jack, if you can hear me, respond! 
Michelle, Marwan's escaped. 
He just blew up the hard drives to all his computers. 
He's trying to cover his tracks. 
I'm going off comm If you want me I'm going to be on my cell. 
Chloe Get data forensics in there now and start a hard target search for Marwan. 
Get me a medic! 
Medic! 
You can't stop it Stop what? 
The course you'll be on What's going to happen within the hour? 
What's going to happen within the hour? 
Mrs. Raines? 
Yes. 
Your husband is in Recovery. 
How is he? 
He's stable, but one of the bullets did some damage to his spine. 
Right now he's paralyzed from the waist down. 
Is it permanent...? 
It's too early to tell. 
That'll take weeks, maybe months, before we fully understand the extent of damage to his spine. 
So it's possible he could regain the use of his legs. 
It's possible, yes. 
But not likely. 
Again, it's too early to tell. 
We could go over the details later, but I'd be lying to you if I told you I was optimistic. 
A lot depends on his attitude, his support system emotional as well as medical. 
Does he know? 
Yes. I just told him. 
I'm sure he'd like to see you. 
Excuse me, can you give us a minute? 
Oh, no, don't even think of feeling sorry for me. 
Whatever they say, I'm going to walk again. 
I know you will. 
So, where's Jack? 
He's still out in the field. 
He called a little while ago, wanted to know how you're doing. 
He knows that bullet was meant for him. 
I was just trying to push him out of the way, I didn't expect to get shot myself. 
What you did was very, very brave, Paul. 
LAPD's widening their search perimeter, but so far they're coming up empty. 
Jack said something might happen within the hour. 
If we don't find Marwan... 
We're going to find him. 
Did you secure Marwan yet? 
No. He must've slipped 
through the perimeter. 
How the hell could you let that happen? 
Doesn't matter how it happened. 
What matters is that he's gone and we're doing everything we can to find him. 
What exactly are you doing to find him? 
We've widened the perimeter, set up a search grid. 
State police and LAPD are conducting a sweep. 
Jack's on line two. 
He says he's got something. 
Put him on the speaker. 
Jack, it's Michelle. 
You're also on with Tony and Bill Buchanan from Division. 
Okay, look, Marwan had an area set up for forging documents. 
Some of them made it through the explosion. 
We managed to secure a number of names and faces. 
Agent Castle is uploading them to your server now. 
I want you to cross-reference them with the watch lists. 
We'll get on it right away. 
Okay, get back to me if you've got a match. 
Edgar... 
I'm initializing the facial recognition software now. 
Good. 
BUCHANAN: Michelle... 
Listen, I'm sorry if I snapped. 
It's okay. 
We're all under a lot of pressure. 
You holding up? 
Fine. 
Edgar, how's that uplink? 
Coming up. 
Chloe... 
how long has Buchanan been at Division? I don't know. 
It took them a while to fill Chapelle's position. 6 months? 
Where he was before that? 
Seattle, I think. 
Seattle? 
Yeah, that's where Michelle was posted while you were in jail, right? 
Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Got a match. 
( cell phone ringing ) This is Bauer. 
MICHELLE: Jack, we have got a match on one of those photos. 
He's on the FBI's watch list. 
His name is Mitch Anderson. 
What do we got on him? 
Ex-military, arrested for drug possession. 
Served time in military prison, was dishonorably discharged four years ago. 
Since then he's been hired as a mercenary in a number of conflicts around the world, came back to the U.S. 
about a year ago. 
Is he under active investigation? 
He was moved up the list when we raised the alert, but he wasn't made a priority. 
The Bureau sent an agent over to check out his apartment. 
Has the agent checked back in yet? 
They may still be in transit. 
Okay, I want you to get me an address on Anderson. 
Start digging up as much information as you can. 
And get me a contact number for the FBI agent. 
I'm on it. 
FBI. 
I'm looking for Mitch Anderson. 
( knocking on door ) This FBI Agent Drake. 
Please open the door. 
( gunshot through silencer ) ( body thuds ) ( cell phone rings ) Agent Drake. 
Hi, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm working with CTU. 
I'm looking for a man named Mitch Anderson. 
Your office said you were investigating him. 
I just got to his apartment a few minutes ago. 
What do you mean, he's not there? 
No. Why is CTU involved? 
Is there new information about Anderson? 
We have evidence connecting him to a man named Habib Marwan. 
Marwan's been responsible for all the terrorist activity earlier today. 
We also have reason to believe he's planning another attack. 
Well, how is Anderson involved? 
I'll advise you when I get there. 
How far away are you? 
About ten minutes out. 
I'll be here. 
Thank you. 
MAN ( over phone ): Yes? 
We had a slight delay. 
I'm heading over there now. 
What about Anderson? 
He's in the air, on his way to the target. 
Everything's on schedule. 
Are your people in place? 
Yes. We're ready to deploy. 
Good. I'll see you 
when we arrive. 
Sorry, but this just isn't cutting it. 
The tone is all wrong. 
Sir, maybe I could give the speechwriters a clearer idea of what you want. 
This is one of the most traumatic days in the history of this country. 
What I want... 
is a speech that is equal to the occasion. 
( sighs ) Give me a few minutes, will you, Robert? 
Let me... think about this 
a little while longer. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
Oh, and, Robert, ask my son to step in, will you? 
Yes, sir. 
Dad? 
Well, a quick trip to Mexico, a low-key state visit, and then we'd finally have some time to spend together. 
It's okay. The, uh, press corp's 
been keeping me entertained. 
You know, ever since your mother died, I promised myself I'd be there for you. 
You've been doing what you had to do. 
I could, uh, use your help right about now. 
I'm going to be addressing the nation in about one hour, and I still don't have a speech that I'm happy with. 
( chuckles ): I'm no speechwriter. 
No, I know. 
But you've got a level head, and you're about the most decent person I know. 
As far as I'm concerned, you represent the very best this country has to offer. 
So... 
what do you want to hear the president say when he addresses you tonight? 
The truth. 
We've been attacked by terrorists. 
Americans are dead. 
The man responsible is still at large, and we are by no means certain that we can catch him before he strikes again. 
What happened earlier... 
may be nothing compared to what happens next. 
That's the truth, Kevin. 
Is that what you think I should say? 
I don't know. 
Neither do I. 
But the fact remains... 
...I have to say something. 
Y-You want me to help you figure it out? 
Absolutely. 
Agent Drake? 
Agent Drake? 
Drop the weapon! 
Drop the weapon now! 
Are you Agent Bauer? 
Yes! 
Now, holster your weapon! 
 I need to se your I.D. 
 I don't have identification I'm working with CTU on a provisional basis. 
I talked to you ten minutes ago. 
Call Division and confirm. 
Agent Drake, just take it easy. 
He's with me. 
Agent Hart, CTU. 
Now, I'm gonna holster my gun. 
I'm gonna show you my credentials. 
I'm sorry. 
With everything that happened today, you can't be too careful. 
I understand. 
Agent Bauer, we just intercepted a call indicating that Anderson was in possession of computer files that could tell us Marwan's next target. 
What's the source of the intercepted call? 
I'm still waiting for the details. 
Did you find the apartment in this condition? 
No. My ASAC thinks 
that Anderson may have hidden a backup copy of the files here. 
I was trying to find it. 
Right now Anderson's our only lead. 
We're gonna stay here and help you finish the job. 
Do a canvass. 
We'll take upstairs. 
( phone ringing ) Where are you? 
I'm almost in position. 
What's the problem? 
Is my cover in place? 
I've told you before yes. 
You'll be 100% safe. 
Marwan, they have to believe I'm dead. 
They will. My people 
have taken care of this. 
They better. 
Because once this is done, the entire world is gonna be looking for me. 
Mm-hmm. I understand. 
Yeah, I'll tell him. 
Thanks, Ruben. 
( sighs )  Edgar. 
 Yeah? 
I have some bad news. 
Do you want me to tell you here or somewhere private? 
 What? 
 I just got off the phone with Ruben Weiss from OSHA, and he said they're not gonna be able to get in the area where your mother died. 
for a few weeks, maybe months. 
Why not? 
Think about it. 
Half-life? Radiation? 
What does that mean? 
Well, he didn't spell it out, but I think that means you're gonna have to have your funeral without the body Of your mother I can't deal with this right now, Chloe. 
Michelle needs prioritized lists for Marwan's pursuit plan. 
Oh. 
Okay, good. 
Do you want me to do that for you? 
No. 
LAPD's locked down the area where Marwan was last seen. 
I need you to review the search grid. 
All right. 
Okay, thanks. 
Michelle. 
When were you planning on telling me? 
About what? 
TONY: About you and Buchanan. 
Never. Because it's none 
of your business. 
Michelle. 
Before you worked with him at Division, you worked with him in Seattle on Homeland Security restructuring, right? 
 Yeah. 
 We were still married then. 
Legally, yes. 
Did you sleep with him while we were married? 
No. 
I didn't. 
But you are now. 
Like I said, it's none of your business. 
Edgar, where are those updates? 
Coming right up. 
( quietly ): Edgar, what are you doing? 
 Miss Dessler. 
 Edgar, wait. 
 What? 
 Wait, before you turn that in, I made a mistake I used Row-Major format instead of Column-Major. 
Why would you do that, Chloe? 
You know Row-Major isn't compatible with our software. 
 It'll bring all our processors to a crawl. 
 I know. It was a mistake. 
I thought it was going to Division. 
Well, fix it. 
Chloe, that was my mistake- why'd you cover for me? 
 You're welcome. 
 You'd have had your job back if you would've let me hand her the disk. 
I thought you had a lot on your mind. 
Agent Bauer? 
Yeah? 
I checked with the neighbors nobody's seen  Mitch Anderson today. 
 Did you talk to the manager? 
Yeah, Anderson kept to himself. 
Paid his rent on time the ideal tenant. 
Okay, thanks. 
Agent Drake? 
Yes? 
Anderson was ex-military, dishonorably discharged. 
This bag is from Vanguard Mills. 
They manufacture medals for the armed forces. 
There's a date stamp on it, three months old. 
Anderson left the military four years ago. 
You think he's currently posing as military. 
It's a distinct possibility I want you to let your people know; we'll do the same. 
Have this scanned and send it over to Chloe at CTU. 
You got it. 
This is Special Agent Drake. 
Can you put me through to Dawson, please? 
Thank you. 
( line ringing ) CTU. Almeida. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
We just found some evidence that indicates that Anderson might be posing as military. 
I want you to update the profiles,  see if anything comes back. 
 All right, I'm on it. 
Okay, thanks. 
Yeah, this is Drake. 
Listen, we just found credible evidence suggesting that Anderson is disguised as military. 
That's right. 
Yes. 
Fine. 
Yes. 
No, that's not a problem. 
Good. 
All right. 
Well, thanks. 
I'll let you know if we find anything else. 
Hey. 
I found something. 
It's an external hard drive this is exactly what we're looking for. 
That's good work. 
Drop the weapon! 
( typing ) ( whispers ): Come on. 
( phone rings ) Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, it's Jack. 
Where's Chloe? 
She's busy doing a systems update. 
Okay. I need you to tell 
Michelle and Tony that the FBI agent that I met at Anderson's apartment was an impostor working for Marwan. 
I killed her, but not before she took out my backup. 
CTU needs to send out a team, lock down the apartment and initiate an investigation. 
Do you want to tell them yourself? 
No, you can tell them in a second. 
Right now, I need you to help me pull some data off a hard drive. 
The directory's locked. 
Hold on one second; I'm going to put you on speakerphone. 
Okay, go ahead. 
Can you get into the root? 
Yeah, but I can't open the files. 
Okay, hold down tab and arrow until the manufacturer's code appears. 
Okay, I got it. 
What are the last three digits on the part code? 
R-Two-Five. 
Escape out and enter pass code C-I-S-Eight-Three-R. 
That should backdoor you into the files. 
( whisper ): Oh, my God. 
Jack, did it work? 
Yeah, I'm in. I need to speak 
to Michelle and Tony now. 
I'll get 'em. 
Jack's on the line. 
Jack, what is it? 
I pulled some data off a hard drive that we found hidden in Anderson's apartment. 
On it is a flight simulator and full schematics to an F-117A Stealth fighter. 
Anderson's an experienced pilot. 
I know. I also think 
he's posing as military. 
I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a Stealth fighter. 
Tony, I'm on my way in. 
What's the holdup? 
 Have you gotten anything from the airport? 
 Hang on, it's coming through. 
Central Air Command reports that an F-117A Stealth fighter took off on a scheduled mission about 40 minutes ago. 
Now, the pilot did not call in on schedule. 
That was about six minutes ago. 
All attempts to contact that pilot have failed. 
Okay, that's it. 
We have to assume Anderson's flying that plane. 
Yeah, I agree. 
Is the aircraft armed? 
Yeah, standard non-nuclear ordinance. 
We're going to have to work up a list of obvious possible targets. 
Yeah. Right. I'm working 
that up right now. 
Wait. 
Air Force One is headed to L.A. 
Jack, did you hear that? 
Yeah, what's the ETA? 
11:00 p. m. 
Oh, my God. 
They're going after the President. 
I'll call Air Force One. 
Tony, we don't have a lot of time. 
I need you to get me the recall frequency for that plane's squadron. 
And send Anderson's bio over to my screen. 
Yeah, I'm on it. 
 Where's Buchanan? 
 He's in Tactical, talking directly with the military. 
Tell him he's going to have to tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff that we believe the likely target is President Keeler aboard Air Force One. 
You really have been helpful, Kevin. 
I think this speech strikes just the right note. 
Mr. President, 
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
It's Michelle Dessler at CTU. 
She says it's urgent. 
Yes, what is it, Ms. Dessler? 
Mr. President, we have reason to 
believe that a Stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist... 
and is in your airspace as we speak. 
This plane is due to land shortly, and I'm about to address the country. 
Just how sure are we about this? 
It's a near certainty, Mr. President. 
We've informed your pilot, and he's preparing to combine evasive action with immediate descent. 
You're cleared to land in Palm Springs. 
I'm sure my escort fighters are perfectly capable of protecting Air Force One. 
Mr. President, this 
is a Stealth aircraft, invisible to radar. 
If he finds you, he may be on you before your fighter escort can react. 
What are the chances he'll find us? 
We can't be sure, Mr. President. 
But the radar signature of a 747 and four fighter planes is unmistakable. 
You're telling me that this stolen Stealth plane will attempt to shoot me down? 
It looks that way, Mr. President. 
I see. 
Dad... 
It's going to be okay. 
It seems our plane may come under attack. 
We're going to take some precautions. 
Get me the Vice President on the phone. 
Yes, sir. 
All right, Jack, it should be coming through right now. 
Yeah, I've got it. 
Not much to go on. 
Parents deceased. 
He has a sister named Alicia. 
Looks like they might have lived together at the same address for a number of years, so they might be close. 
Any recent contact information? 
No. Let me see if I 
can find that for you. 
No, we don't have any time. 
Have you got  the recall frequency? 
 Yeah. 
Get ready to patch me through to Anderson. 
Copy that. 
Air Force One is descending through 20,000 feet. 
The fighters have formed a protective shield. 
How long before it touches down? 
Nine minutes. 
And the fighters report no sign of Stealth aircraft? 
Not yet. 
Maybe it's not there. 
It's there, we just can't see it. 
We're being beaten by our own technology. 
Jack, you're set. 
When you hit your intercom button, you'll be patched through to the Stealth fighter. 
Copy that. 
( beeping ) JACK: Mitch Anderson, can you hear me? 
Captain Anderson, do you read me? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm a federal agent. 
We know who you are, we know what you're trying to do. 
Sir, I know you can hear me. 
Nothing you've done so far can't be undone. 
All you have to do is change your vector to heading oneone five-southeast. 
That'll put you on a fast track to Andrews Air Force Base. 
Once you touch down, then we can discuss how you want to handle his. 
Please just talk to me. 
Explain to me what you're trying to do, what you're trying to accomplish. 
Why? 
I've been going over your service record. 
It's very impressive. 
Graduated top of your class, Air Force Academy. 
Highly decorated for your service in Desert Storm, including Air Force Silver Star. 
What happened to you? 
Explain it to me. 
Because what you're trying to do right now... 
I don't think that's who you are. 
I don't think that's how you want to be remembered. 
If I go down, you have to stay the course. 
Do you understand? 
Mr. President, I'm... I'm sure 
it won't come to that. 
KEELER: Charles, you're the Vice President. 
The nation will be relying on you. 
If the worst happens, think of me as a casualty of war. 
Don't waste time. 
Just pick up the torch and move forward. 
Yes, sir, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, we think CTU 
is in communication with the pilot of the stolen aircraft. 
Patch it through. 
JACK: I've just been notified by the FBI that they've contacted your sister, Alicia. 
They've advised her of what's happening. 
She's scared. 
She wants to talk to you. 
All you have to do, Captain Anderson, is respond to me, and I'll put her right through. 
( static crackles ) Captain Anderson? 
Captain Anderson?! 
Chloe, I think we've been cut off. 
Is there an override channel? 
He's cut off all communication circuits. 
I don't think there's anything we can do. 
Damn it! 
Dad... 
I'm scared. 
( beeping ) ( indistinct pilot chatter ) ( radio static crackles ) Was Air Force One just hit? 
Was Air Force One just hit?! 
( Woman speaking indistinctly over radio ) Escort pilots report... 
Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit by an air-to-air missile. 
Pieces are falling to the ground over the desert... 
Put down the gun! 
Put the gun down now! 
Drop it, now! Step back! 
I'll kill her! 
I will kill her! 
( yells ) Jack, when I was inside, I recognized one of the men. 
Who? 
I can't place him, but I know that I saw him before today. 
Why did they think you were holding something back from them? 
I will not tell these people things about my private life that they don't need to know. 
That you don't think they need to know. 
What are you doing here? 
Your mother told Madwan you took care of the American girl? 
Yeah? 
Then you'll need help getting rid of the body. 
He's going to kill our son. 
Yes. 
You brought me here to kill me! 
I took care of the girl! 
Madwan knows! 
It's not Madwan that wants you dead! 
Who wants me dead? 
Your father. 
Thank you so much for helping me out. 
They said Maya's arrived? 
She's in the exam area. 
I'm about to do her work-up. 
ERIN: She suffers from schizophrenia. 
I want us to be together again. 
I'm sorry, Paul. 
I'm seeing someone. 
Paul, this is Jack Bauer. 
Nice to meet you. 
What was your courier transporting? 
MAN: A Dobson-type override. 
What exactly does this override do? 
It's a combination of hardware and software that can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility. 
And the person in possession of this program, could they do the opposite with it? 
Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown? 
Theoretically, yes. 
ERIN: How many nuclear power plants in this country would be vulnerable? 
All of them. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
It's me. 
They found out about the override. 
Jack, did you get the surveillance footage from Hyatt Security? No, they 
heard each dinner that you attended was monitored by a private company Felsted Security- I just got off the phone with them. 
They've got the videotapes on file, but unfortunately, they're working off a closed system. 
I've got to go there, pick up the tapes, bring them back here for you to I.D. 
Where are you on the guest list? 
I'm having it sent here. 
You know, we're running out of time. 
What do you mean? 
Is it that urgent? 
Yes. As it turns out, your 
kidnapping was just a cover for a much larger attack. 
The terrorists used the broadcast of the trial to overload the Internet, and diverted all of our attention away from what they were really trying to do. 
I need a full tactical for my vehicle. 
Which is what? 
They're in possession of a stolen device called an override. 
With that, they've gained control of the 104 nuclear power plants across this country. 
The override device maintains heat levels within the reactors. 
Effectively, they can meltdown every one of those plants. 
Oh, God... my God. 
Thank you. 
The man you saw when you were being held captive, right now, he's our only lead. 
Then let me come to Felsted Security with you and make the I.D. there. It'll 
be quicker. Audrey, I can't. 
After what you've been through today, I'm not going to put you at risk. 
You just said our nation's nuclear power plants will melt down if we don't find that override, Jack. 
We can't afford to waste any more time. 
Come over here. 
There are 104 nuclear power stations in the United States. 
We just learned that terrorists are trying to convert all 104 nuclear cores into weapons. 
Give us the worst-case casualty scenarios, Curtis. 
This graphic represents a single meltdown scenario. 
Edgar, break it down for us. 
If we can't wrest control of the override, it will shut down the entire cooling system and the core will melt through the containment building. 
In the first three hours, the population within a ten-mile radius will receive the highest doses of radiation. 
Most people will die within two days. 
Now, the smallest of these 104 cities represents 75,000 people. 
Multiply that by 104, we're looking at three million casualties, and that's conservative. 
The environmental impact would also be catastrophic. 
30 miles in all directions of each plant will be uninhabitable for at least five years. 
Don't these plants have multiple security systems to prevent this kind of breech? 
They do, but the override has already deactivated them. 
ERIN: And if we don't succeed, how long before these cores start to melt down? 
I'm projecting the first radiation shock waves in approximately three hours. 
All right, I want everyone here from Com and Logistics to work on getting a handle on the software. 
The rest of you will handle support in conjunction with NRC personnel. 
Let's get to work. 
JACK: Erin, we're leaving now. 
Where you going, Jack? 
Audrey's given us a significant lead. We need to follow it up. 
What kind of lead? 
When we were being held, I recognized someone  he was an American. I saw him at 
a function here in L.A. 
a couple months ago. 
We're going to view the surveillance tapes of the function at a private security company not far from here. 
I don't want her going out now. 
Why can't you access the tapes here? 
JACK: Sir, I wish we could, but they're off line. 
They would have to record over four and a half hours of material for us to view. 
We don't have that time. 
Jack told me that these people are trying to use our nuclear power plants as weapons. We have to follow 
this lead, and we have to follow it now. 
JACK: Sir, Audrey's the only person who can make this I.D. 
If anything happens, Jack, I will hold you personally responsible. 
I understand. 
How far away is this facility? 
Not far. Burbank. 
Audrey... 
Paul. 
I'll get the team set up. 
We need to talk. 
We'll have to do it when I get back. 
Get back from where? 
We're following up on something. 
Paul, please- can we just do this later? 
How many on your team? 
Four of us. 
Set up a weapons package. 
I'll meet you in the motor pool. Done. 
( quietly ): ... cannot 
see each other anymore. 
Look, I don't know about all of this, but I know about you and him, I am not okay with that. 
Look, you and I aren't together anymore. 
I thought we were trying to work things out. 
Yeah, I tried, but you kept putting it off. 
So I gave up. 
We haven't been together for over nine months. 
We're not trying to work out anything anymore. 
Mr. Raines, 
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
She is my wife. 
Paul, please. 
Excuse me. 
She's my wife. 
Don't you forget that. 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Jack, I'm sorry. 
It's fine. 
Hey, I just received these files from DOD. 
I need to give them to Jack Bauer. 
Oh, you can't. 
Jack just left. 
Oh, well, um, can I forward them to him? 
No, he went with Audrey Raines to Felsted Security to look at some archive footage. 
Okay... well, I guess I can just 
hold on to them for him. 
Yeah, that'd be fine. 
Paul. 
Jim, we need to talk. 
Come in here. 
Did you know about Audrey and Jack Bauer? 
Not till an hour ago. 
Well, I've got to tell you, they were carrying on right under your nose. 
It's pretty unprofessional, wouldn't you say? 
Look, I understand your feelings about this, but you and Audrey have been separated for almost a year. 
Paul, I'm sorry, but she's a big girl. 
She can do what she wants. 
Well, what she's doing is she... 
she's breaking my heart. 
Maryanne... 
Sarah. 
What do you need back here? 
Um... Edgar asked me to do 
a manual reboot of Hub Five. 
Oh, I can do that for him. 
No, no, it's fine. 
Okay. 
( phone ringing ) MAN: Yes? 
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago. 
Where'd they go? 
Felsted Security. 
357 White Oak Boulevard. 
It's in Burbank. 
All right, good. 
You're going to need to set things up on your end. 
What are you talking about? 
I should be done here. 
No. When Jack Bauer and 
Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked the location. 
( sighs ) All right. What do I do? 
Divert suspicion. 
Fine. 
I'm standing live in an area just outside of the perimeter. 
Unfortunately, the Pentagon is not commenting at this time. 
But what we do know is that at 12:10 p. m., 
Secretary Heller and his daughter, Audrey Raines, were successfully rescued. 
The number of fatalities is unknown, but sources say there might have been as many as 20 terrorists inside the building at the time, and it appears there are no survivors among them. 
It is also unclear as to... 
Yes? 
It looks like all the critical instructions went with him, before the assault. 
Yes. 
The override has taken control of the nuclear power plants. 
What about Behrooz? 
What about our son? 
We have to be strong now. 
We'll mourn him when this is over. 
REPORTER: ... and as you might imagine, 
among the most difficult of days for Secretary Heller and his daughter. 
The Secret Service was previously swarming over this area to secure it, but have since taken the Secretary to an undisclosed location for his safety. 
( phone rings ) We hope to have more information, as officials are preparing to make a public statement. 
Hello? 
Mom? 
Behrooz? 
Are you all right? 
Tariq tried to kill me. 
He was going to shoot me. 
I had to defend myself. 
What did you do? 
I killed him. 
You can't let Father know. 
Why not? 
Because Father is the one who told Tariq to do it. 
He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie. 
Behrooz, that's not possible. 
Your father would never want to hurt you. 
It's true. 
Mom, I don't know what to do. 
You have to help me. 
Where are you now? 
I'm near the Metrolink station on Lassen in Chatsworth. 
Are you using Tariq's car? 
Yes. 
Hide it. I'll pick you up there 
in a half hour. 
Hurry. 
Who was on the phone? 
It was nothing important. 
Liar. 
What did Behrooz do? 
No, what did you do? 
Did you give the order? 
Behrooz was not committed. 
It was just a matter of time before he turned against us. 
You ordered Tariq to kill him. 
To kill our own son. 
No, no, no, you... 
Where is Tariq? 
Behrooz killed him. 
That's impossible. 
Because you think he's weak? 
He's not. 
Nothing... nothing 
will stand in the way of what needs to be done. 
Not him, not you. 
Where is he now? 
Why? 
What are you going to do? 
You're hurting me. 
I will do more than that. 
Now you listen to me, woman. 
You will do exactly as you told him. 
You will pick him up in a half an hour. 
What did you say to Paul? 
That I'm filing for divorce as soon as I get back to D.C. 
Are you sure that's what you want? 
Yes. 
Okay. 
Yes! 
Do you have something? 
It looks like the Dobson override device hasn't completely taken control of all the reactors. 
I'm starting to get some response. What could I do? 
Nothing. Just stay off Hub Five. 
I need it. 
I thought Hub Five was out for a reboot. 
No. 
Curtis! Come here! 
Could I talk to you for a minute? 
Actually, I'm kind of busy. 
You lied to me about doing a reboot for Edgar. 
Yes, I did. 
Why? 
Sarah, I had a personal call to make, and I knew it would be inappropriate at the time of the crisis. 
I didn't want anyone to know. 
Then why'd you do it in here? 
Why didn't you just go outside? 
I was trying to make it look like I was working, okay? 
Look, I'm sorry. 
It won't happen again. 
( cell phone rings ) It's Madwan. 
( cell phone ringing ) Yes. 
Has Tariq taken care of your son? 
I haven't spoken to Tariq yet, but I'm sure if there was a problem, he would've called me. 
The fact that I'm even talking to you about this is a problem. 
The next two hours are crucial. 
I can't be distracted by this. 
I understand. 
I promise, I will personally oversee the situation and make sure it is resolved. 
Fix this, Navi. 
Of course. 
What is Madwan going to say if he finds out Behrooz killed Tariq? 
Tariq is expendable, like we all are. 
Madwan understands that. 
All he cares about is that Behrooz is silenced. 
I will not be able to look at you after today without thinking about what we did to him. 
I think I got it. 
What? 
The Dobson override. 
I think I've got a piece of the code. 
What does that mean? 
If this is really it, I can turn off the override, and stop the remaining plants from melting down. 
What do you need? 
To get into the software kernel, but the NRC will never let me. 
It's too dangerous. Why? 
If I tinker in there and screw up, I can start a chain reaction. 
All right, Edgar. 
I'm going to need you to present this to Heller. 
He can order NRC to let you in. 
Present to Heller? 
Yeah, he's in the situation room. 
I shouldn't do this, Curtis. 
Why not? 
I could faint. 
I feel very nauseous. 
I have low blood sugar. 
It's just Driscoll and Heller. 
Driscoll's in there, too? 
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. 
I'm going to have to interrupt you. 
What is it? This is Edgar 
Stiles, our chief analyst. 
He's requesting access to the kernels of the power plants. 
My understanding is that no one is to manipulate those kernels while the plants are on line. 
Yes, but there is a way to do it if you're careful. 
I'd have to stay away from the pre-compiled headers, while I was putting the software lock on the Dobson override code. 
But the chances of causing a load imbalance... 
I don't understand one thing you're talking about. 
Just tell me what the downside is if the kernels are disrupted because of your manipulation. 
( sighs ) If I make a mistake, I can accelerate a core meltdown in some of the reactors. 
This is probably a bad idea. 
Maybe we shouldn't do it. 
But if you're successful, you can regain control of the reactors? 
Yes. 
Edgar, what we need to know is can you do this without making a mistake? 
Yeah, I can do it. 
You're not filling me with confidence, Edgar. 
Look... 
I'm just a little nervous. 
But if I say I can do it, I can do it. 
He'll run away the moment he sees you. 
He won't see me. 
You'll be the only one in the car when you pick him up. 
( cell phone rings ) It's Behrooz. 
Answer it. 
( cell phone ringing ) Hello? 
Are you almost here? 
Yes. 
What did you tell Dad? 
I didn't; I just left. 
He was busy working. 
What are we going to do? 
Wherever we go, he'll find us. 
No, he won't. 
I know a safe place. 
I didn't understand, until today, what it would feel like. 
Doing these things they're wrong, Mom. 
And I see it now. 
Don't think about that anymore. 
You'll be safe now. 
But I am thinking about it. 
Maybe I should go to the police and tell them everything I know. 
We'll talk about it when I get there. 
Okay. 
You did well. 
Who are they? 
Don't worry about it. 
Just make sure you take the second exit at Angeles Crest. 
He's going to ask me why I'm stopping. 
Let him ask. 
What do I tell him? 
Don't tell him anything. 
We'll meet you there. 
Erin? We're making 
good progress. 
Tell me. We've been able to take 
87 power plants off line, they're safe. 
What about the other 17? The 
terrorists were able to use the override to block a shutdown. 
Everything we're trying is being repelled. 
What are we doing to get around it? 
Believe me, Erin, we're trying everything. 
If there's a way, we'll find it. 
I'll keep you posted. 
( sobbing ) Sweetheart? 
Mom. 
How are you feeling? 
Not good. 
I don't like these doctors. 
I want Dr. Runwith. 
You can't see him today. 
You can't see him today. 
Why not? 
Because I can't leave here. 
And I want you close by. 
Then stay here with me. 
I'll be back in a few minutes, I promise. 
But you have to do something for me, okay? 
I want you to do something. 
Look at me. 
Maya, look at me. 
You need to cooperate with the doctors. 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Come on. 
I'll be back. 
I promise. 
Take these, please. 
Your son was in sensory deprivation for a total of two and a half hours. 
What did he say when you took him off it? 
Nothing. 
You tortured my son for almost three hours and ended up yielding nothing? 
You gave the order, sir. 
Give us a moment, please. 
I'm sorry this had to happen, Richard, but we had to make sure that you weren't withholding anything from us. 
I hate you. 
I never want to see you again. 
Please understand that I am responsible for the lives of millions of people. 
You torture me and now you want me to forgive you? 
This just confirms everything I always knew about you. 
Am I free to leave? 
Yes. 
( phone rings ) Yeah, Paul. 
Audrey, do you have a minute? 
Sure, what's going on? 
I just talked to your dad, and he said something to me that I've been thinking about it a lot. 
He said that you're a big girl, and I think I've been treating you like a child. 
I don't think that, Paul. 
Well, whether it comes off that way or not, I need to respect your choices, respect who you are and... ( sighs ) 
I've been so stupid about all of this. 
I've lost sight of the things I love about you. 
Look, uh... 
I hear what you're saying, but I don't... 
I don't really know how to respond to that. 
Well, you don't have to. 
I just want you to know that I've been wrong about a lot of things and before you make any big decisions, decisions that you're entitled to make, let some time go by. 
Is that fair? 
Is that fair of me to ask? 
Yeah. Yeah, 
that's fair. 
Okay, well, I'll, uh... 
I'll see you later. 
Yeah. See you later. 
How far out are we? 
A few miles away, sir. 
Okay. 
Where are we going to go? 
Out of the city. 
Why did Father want to kill me? 
I'm his son. 
Stop, Behrooz, you can't think about that now. 
Get in. 
Get in. 
Mom, we killed two people today. 
I can't do this. 
I'm freaking out. 
Shh. 
Get on the train. 
What? 
Your father's following us. 
What?! 
It was the only way I could save you. 
Now, damn it, Behrooz, get out, go. 
Go! 
Obey me! 
Oh, God! 
Mom! 
Mom! 
Oh, God! 
Go! 
( screaming ) ( groaning ) Watch out! 
( tires squealing ) Is it taken care of? 
No, there's a problem. 
My wife and Behrooz have betrayed us. 
Where are they now? 
I don't know. 
But Dina's been wounded. 
She'll have to get medical attention. 
So you've come to me asking me for help with this mess? 
I can't do it alone, Madwan. 
I'm ashamed of myself. 
Allow me to make this right. 
What would you need? 
To monitor local hospitals. 
I'll also need drivers, as well as access to police frequencies. 
You think she'll go to the police? 
No, no. 
But they may pick her up if they find out she's been shot. 
I told you... 
I can't be distracted by this right now. 
Give him what he needs. 
Make sure the woman and child are captured before they can do us harm. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Madwan. 
No matter what happens today, you will answer for this. 
I understand. 
No, we just got here. 
How long is it going to take you to create the database? 
Okay. 
Okay, Marcie, thanks. 
Our office just got a copy of the guest list from the dinner where you saw this guy. 
Once you make an I.D. on the 
surveillance tape, we'll be able to send it through a database, and we'll find out who it is. 
Okay. 
I'm carrying. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah. 
Jack, this is Maryanne Taylor at CTU. 
What is it, Maryanne? 
Curtis wanted me to tell you that as soon as Audrey recognizes somebody from the surveillance video, he wants it sent directly to my system. 
I'm on 60 Casper. 
Why didn't he tell me himself? 
They're still trying to shut down all the remaining power plants, and everybody else is still working on that. 
Are they going to be able to control them in time? 
I don't know. 
Okay, keep me informed. 
What is it? 
We don't have a lot of time. 
She seems to be doing better now. She's sleeping. 
Oh, that's very good news. 
Did you give her Haldol? 
Mm-hmm. Why? 
She's allergic to it. 
It's in her file! 
The date on this is gone. 
This is the wrong file. 
Maya! Maya! 
Maya? She's unconscious! 
Mary, we have a code! 
I need 25 cc's of norepinephrine. 
How could you have gotten the wrong file? 
I need that syringe now. 
Ms. Driscoll, 
Secretary Hel... 
What is it, Sarah? 
Sarah! 
Secretary Heller needs you. 
For what? He's going online 
with the President in a few minutes and he wants to know about our progress on the reactors. 
Um, tell him that they're still trying to get control of the system kernel and that we'll know more in 15 minutes. 
If we do stop the meltdown, he wants to know if there's going to be any system contamination. 
Uh, no, there won't be any contamination. 
It'll take 36 hours to reboot the reactors. 
Is there anything else? 
No, that's all. 
All right, go. 
We had security cameras running on only two areas of the event. 
One was covering the main ballroom and one was at the entrance. 
Okay, put them both up. 
The ballroom angle is too wide. 
Let's just go with the entrance. 
What time is that? 
6:39. 
No, that's too early. 
I met him when I arrived, around 9:00, 9:15. 
( keys clicking ) Wait, stop. 
Can you back this up a few frames? 
Sure. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Stop there. 
I think that's him. 
Can you enhance him right here? Yeah. 
That image won't process. 
We need to make it clearer. 
Okay, let me see if I can get that for you. 
Who's supposed to be at that desk? 
Oh, that's Mitchell. 
Probably went out for another smoke. 
JACK: The back gate's wide open. 
No one's there. 
Greg, do you copy? 
Greg? 
Rick? 
How many ways into this area of the building? 
Two. 
Put them up. Rick! 
Get down. Get down! 
( gunshots ) Are you okay? 
Yeah!( tech grunts ) 
Damn it! 
I'm going to look for help, okay? But first I need to know 
about the surveillance tape Where's the source? 
The main... 
ser... server... 
How do I access it? 
Put it on the... 
the... flash memory. 
Okay. 
Watch the security monitors. 
Do you have sticks? 
( gasping ) Gary, do you have sticks? 
In my... in my... pocket. 
Okay. 
Stay with me. 
He's gone. 
Jack, they're coming. 
JACK: They're trying to seal us off. 
Shouldn't we call CTU? 
No, CTU's got to be compromised. 
That's the only way they'd know we were here. 
We've got to get out of here. 
Move. Go, go! 
Go. 
Go, go. 
There's one in the pipe. 
The safety's off. 
Jack... 
You can do this. 
We'll cover each other. 
I thought you said CTU's been compromised. 
It has been. 
Then who are you calling? 
The only person I can trust right now. 
If there are 17 nuclear power plants about to melt down, I need to update an evacuation strategy. 
I agree, sir. 
I've already laid the groundwork with the National Guard. 
They're preparing to go into individual communities and effect a civil defense evacuation upon your command. 
You say our worst-case scenario gives us approximately three hours. 
That's correct, sir. 
Erin, what are our chances of shutting down the remaining 17? 
At this time, I would say it's less than 50%, but we're trying something now that might improve those chances. 
When will you know more? 
In the next 15 minutes. 
Keep me updated. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Let's find out from Jack and Audrey if they've come up with anything on their end. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Secretary, I can have a room 
prepared for you to rest, if you like. 
You've been under a great deal of strain these past few hours. 
No, I don't think I can rest, but thanks, anyway. 
Erin? 
Yes, sir? 
I understand your daughter is down in the clinic. 
Yes, but it won't interfere with my work. 
I'm sure it won't. 
I was just wondering if everything was okay. 
It's something we've lived with since she was six years old. 
There are good days and bad days. 
Today's a bad one. 
I'm sorry. 
( whispering ): We're heading right. 
Come on. 
Come here. 
Okay, we're going to get through this. 
You've got to listen to me. 
I need to get that guy's weapon. Mm-hmm. 
I need you to provide cover. 
Save your ammunition. 
Space out your shots. 
You ready? 
Mm-hmm. 
Okay. 
Damn it. 
Audrey, get down! 
I'm out! 
Go! 
I'm empty. 
What? 
I'm empty! 
( gunshots ) Jack! 
Tony! 
You okay? 
Yeah! We're all right! 
Move! Move! 
Edgar's just started the final sequence. 
Is he in the kernel yet? 
Yes. This is where he 
can't make a mistake. 
If he does, he'll accelerate the meltdowns instead of stopping them. 
Sarah, look up the out codes for Load "A" registered condition. 
"FF-09." 
No, that's a jump "A", I need a load "A." 
Damn it, move. 
That's it, "AB-A1." 
I think I got it. 
What do you mean, you think? I'd like to go 
through it again before I send it, please. 
How long will that take? 
Ten minutes. We don't have 
time. You have to do it now. 
Let me just check the headers. 
Now, Edgar. 
( typing ) I did the best I could, sir. I hope it works. 
So do I. 
There's no response. 
( quietly ): Come on. 
There they go. 
Congratulations, Edgar. 
Oh, no, don't tell me that. 
ERIN: Edgar, what's going on? 
Why are some of the reactors still not shutting down? 
Edgar? 
Edgar, talk to me. 
Six of the reactors are immune to the kill sequence. 
The Dobson override's already taken over their system. 
Those six are going to melt down? 
The shutdown codes have been completely corrupted. 
Contact Bauer. 
Either he finds the people responsible for planning the override, or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust. 
English subtitles by PoneyTeam For God's sake, pull yourself together. 
You didn't have to kill her. 
Yes, I did, because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself. 
Courage? To poison a girl 
who did no harm to you at all? 
This is my husband Navi. 
This is Debbie's mother. 
Is she here? 
We haven't seen her since yesterday. 
Get in the car, follow her. 
Make sure she doesn't go to the police. 
Chlo�, you're out of here. 
Chloe. 
Don't worry, Edgar. Driscoll 
doesn't know you were helping me. 
She doesn't? 
I'm the one who got you into this, I'm not going to sell you out. 
We'll be here until you tell me what I need to know. 
Richard, your father was kidnapped by terrorists. 
Our polygraph analysis tells us you're hiding something that might help us find him. 
There are people on the outside looking for us. 
You cannot give up. 
I have to do something while I still can. 
This trial is going to be a spectacle, broadcast all over the world, designed to humiliate and degrade this country. 
There's a gas pipe. 
Did you check out the briefcase? 
Mm. It's fine. 
I was afraid it might be damaged in the train crash. 
The case is very strong. 
Come on! Get them out! 
Now! Come on! 
Hurry, open the door! Now! 
I know you. 
She recognized me. 
She has to be killed. 
Erin, I'm on sight. 
Jack, stand down. 
What are you talking about? 
The Marines won't get there on time. 
The President wants to take out the building with a missile strike. 
With the secretary and his daughter inside? 
Yes. 
I'm sorry. 
You're going to have to clear the area. 
Jack, don't go in there alone. 
Jack, clear the area! The 
building is going to be destroyed! 
The following takes places between 12:00 P.M. and 01:00 P.M. 
James Heller, you have been brought before this court of law to stand trial as a war criminal. 
We will prove to the people of the world that these crimes against humanity are the direct result of the polices initiated by you in your capacity. 
Since the true extent of your evil legacy is immeasurable, we have done our best to document those acts which have been witnessed directly by the chosen followers. 
Under your orders, the death squads of America, continue their imperious crusade against the true believers and pure followers. 
How much longer until the fighter is ready to launch the missile? 
Command and control is locking on target now. 
Mr. President, I have Erin 
Driscoll on line three. 
Mr. President, I'm calling 
to ask you to consider aborting the missile strike. 
Based on what? 
We are attempting a rescue operation. 
I was told that the Marine Strike Force was still 10 to 20 minutes away. 
They are, sir. 
Jack Bauer went in by himself. 
The terrorist group is moments away from executing the Secretary of Defense in front of the world. 
And I cannot allow that to happen. 
I understand, sir. 
But if Jack can effect a rescue before that happens... 
In that case, I'll abort the missile strike. 
But he's running out of time. 
How long does he have, sir? 
Seven minutes. 
Try and make a sound, I'll blow your head off. 
This is a map of the complex. 
Where are they holding the Secretary of Defense? 
I am either going to kill you now, or you're going to tell me where they are staging the trial! 
Point... now. Where is the secretary? 
There is no place in this world where your evil has not scoured the sacred land of the true word. 
Your imperialistic legacy has devoured the lives of the innocent. 
 Jack? 
 Yeah? 
The President won't call off the missile strike. 
How much time do I have? 
Less than six minutes. 
Did you get a read from the thermal scan on how many hostiles inside? 
We estimate 16. 
Jack? 
I'm not turning back, Erin. 
Understood. 
Good luck. 
...the injustices that 
you have committed... 
Stop this, please. 
...on behalf of... 
Just stop this, please. 
You've got to stop this. 
My father hasn't done anything to hurt you. 
He's an innocent man. Please! 
Please. He's innocent. 
Please. 
Listen to me. 
Please, no, no, no, wait, wait, no. 
You've got to stop it! Listen. 
Audrey? 
Behind you. 
Oh, my God. 
Jack! 
Are you all right? 
Did they hurt you? 
No, I'm okay. 
You've got to stop them. 
I will. 
Get my father first. 
Go. 
Take this. 
Press the button on the handle. 
You use that if you have to. 
I'll be back for you, I promise. 
Jack. 
Finally, we hold you responsible for blasphemy. 
For desecrating holy lands and shrines, and for spilling the blood of our brothers. 
James Heller, your guilt on these charges is not a matter of dispute. 
I have, here, a full confession that you have signed. 
And so, now, it is time for your sentence to be read and for the execution of that sentence to be carried out. 
James Heller, before the eyes of God, I sentence you to death... 
to be carried out... immediately. 
Call off the missile. Call it off! 
Abort. Abort. Please confirm. 
He's doing it. 
There's one in the pipe, safety's off. 
We've got to get Audrey. 
Down the hall. 
It's been aborted. 
The strike's been called off. 
Where are the Marines? 
They haven't crossed the perimeter. 
I'll get an updated E.T.A. 
We're clear. 
She was here. 
We got to go. Move! 
Take the two shooters at your 11:00. 
You ready? Go! 
Give me a clip. 
Jack! 
It went off my vest. 
It's all right. Keep firing. 
I'm out. 
I'm out, too. 
It's the Marines. Stay down! 
Mr. Secretary, stay down. 
Just stay down until this area is secure. 
Jack! 
Jack! Jack! 
Put the gun down! 
Step back or I'll kill her! 
Put the gun down! 
Step back! I will kill her! 
Step back! 
I will kill her! 
I will kill her! 
Do it! 
Okay. Okay, just relax. 
Now just stay calm. 
Just relax. 
This is over. 
You're surrounded. 
You're right. 
First, you'll watch her die. 
Yes, sir. 
The President sends along his gratitude. 
I'm just glad you both are all right. 
It's been a while since you've been in the field, Jack. 
Looks like you haven't skipped a beat. 
Audrey and I owe you our lives. 
Thank you, sir. 
I've arranged transportation for us back to CTU. 
I'd like you and Audrey to be debriefed there. 
Just as long as we don't lose any time in finding out who these terrorists are and where they're coming from. 
As soon as we get back there, I'll set up a live feed with the office in Washington. 
You won't miss a step. 
Those soldiers there are waiting to take us back  to CTU. 
 Thanks. 
How's she doing? 
The doctor needs to check out some of these contusions and she's dehydrated. 
Thank you. 
 You should go. 
 Where? 
I'm taking you and your father back to CTU Jack, when I was inside, I-I recognized one of the men. 
Who? 
I don't know. 
I-I can't place him, but I know that I saw him before today. 
They're going to correlate a photo file of all the casualties. 
As soon as they've got that, you can make your I.D. 
Excuse me. Bauer. 
Agent Bauer, this is CTU. 
I've got Paul Raines, on the line. 
He'd like to speak to his wife. 
Is she with you? 
Hold on one second. 
It's Paul. 
He wants to speak with you. 
Paul. 
Audrey. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine. 
Thank God. 
Where are you? 
As soon as I heard about you and your father, I got on a plane. 
You're in L.A.? 
Yeah. I'm at CTU. 
Audrey? 
Yeah. 
See you soon. 
I'll see you soon. 
We need to go. 
You all right? 
Mm-hmm. 
Make sure Edgar gets this. 
Find anything? 
I'm still trying to connect up with the feed from the rescue site. 
Division is using up most of our bandwidth. 
Call over there and tell them to multiplex. We need to start 
going through the debris. 
Yeah, now that Heller is safe, we're no longer in first position. 
Miss Driscoll. 
I took care of it. 
What's that? 
Our list of passcodes for the FBI fiber. 
You can use their feed. 
How did you get that? 
I used to consult there. 
I still have friends. 
As soon as I saw the load on the routing table, I knew we'd run into a traffic jam. 
Good. Install it. 
Start cataloging whatever's there. Anything that flags, 
promote it up to me. 
You know... if 
you let me, Curtis, I can help you a whole lot more. 
Honestly, I don't even know why you have a problem with me. 
Because I'm ambitious? 
Okay, I'm ambitious. Aren't you? 
I don't sleep with people to get ahead in my career. 
Neither do I. 
I slept with you because I was attracted to you. 
I still am. 
Deal with it. 
A White House spokesman has just confirmed that the interrupted video transmission was caused by a raid mounted by the Marines and the counter-terrorist unit, who rescued Secretary of Defense James Heller moments ago. 
Yes, I'm watching. 
Of course I'm watching. 
God willing, our good fortune will continue for the rest of the day. 
Thank you. 
What are you talking about? 
It's over. 
They found Omar. 
The government stopped the trial. 
Yes, I know. 
Then how can you say this is all good fortune? 
Everything we've worked for is ruined. 
You made me kill someone I cared about, all for nothing. 
No, not for nothing, Behrooz. 
The trial was only our first step. 
I don't understand. 
There were certain things that your mother and I decided to keep from you. 
What things? 
Please, I'm busy. 
You forced me to kill my girlfriend because of this trial. 
You owe me an explanation. 
I don't owe you anything! 
See who it is. 
See who it is! 
It's Terrick. 
Why is he here? 
Terrick. 
Behrooz, you remember Terrick. 
Of course he does. 
I just spoke with Madwan. 
He assured me that everything is still on schedule. 
 That's right. 
 What are you doing here? 
Your mother told Madwan you took care of the American girl? 
Yeah? 
Then you'll need help getting rid of the body. 
I don't need any help. 
I can do it myself. 
I'm sure you can, Behrooz, but we can't afford any more mistakes. 
Show Terrick where the body is. 
Go. 
Okay, Agent Manning, this is the last of the bodies. 
 You shoud see them now. 
 All right. Got it. 
What's next? 
Here's some more of the terrorist gear we collected out of the warehouse. 
Wait a second. 
top. Go back. 
You need me to retransmit? 
No. On the ground 
in front of you. Can you give 
me a shot of that briefcase? 
This? 
Yeah. Can you open it? 
It's empty. 
Are there any identifying marks on it? 
Some kind of logo engraved near the lock. 
Let me see. Zoom in. 
Zoom in. 
Make sure that gets on the next transport back here. 
Will do. 
Sarah. I need you 
to do a corporate logo search. I may have found 
a link between the train crash and Heller's abduction. 
I'm sending it to you now. 
Okay. We'll pick this up later. 
The man I recognized at the warehouse I want to make that ID. 
As soon as you've been checked out by the clinic. 
I'll get the photos ready. 
Excuse me, Ms. Raines. 
This way, please. 
It's all right. Go ahead. 
Okay good. 
Excuse us. 
I'm going to need to use your station. 
Have Driscoll send me over a passcode for the onsite feed. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
Does he know? 
About you and Jack. 
How long have you known? 
Not until today. 
Although I'm surprised that I hadn't figured it out till now. 
But it's not what you think. 
Paul and I were over before Jack and I started seeing each other. 
Except Paul doesn't think it's over. 
Last time I spoke with him, he thought he had a second chance. 
Yeah, well, that's more about fixing his wounded pride than fixing this relationship. 
So he doesn't know about it. 
Not yet. 
I'll take care of it. 
This way, please. 
Yeah. 
No, not till I get back to DC. 
Sarah said you may have found a thread connecting the train bombing to Heller's abduction. 
Yeah. About an hour ago, NTSB 
reported that a passenger was killed, but not as a result of the crash. 
He was shot at close range. 
Who is he? 
We're still trying to find out. 
He had no I.D. 
His face and prints don't show up on any database. 
But whoever killed him stole something he had chained to his wrist. 
I think it may have been this. 
A witness on the train saw a man with a briefcase handcuffed to him. 
Take a look at the damage. 
It could have been sustained during the crash. 
We just recovered this where Heller was being held. 
What are you telling me? 
That the train bombing was a cover for the theft of this briefcase? 
What was in it? 
It was empty. 
We traced the corporate logo on the briefcase to McLennen-Forster. 
 The defense contractor? 
 Yeah. 
Have you contacted them? 
Just got off the phone with their CEO. 
He stonewalled. 
Said before he disclosed anything, we'd need special clearance from the Department of Defense. 
The Secretary should be able to get us whatever clearances we need from DOD. 
Let's get a printout of all this. 
Yeah. 
...story, only moments ago, a second 
broadcast showing secretary of defense James Heller was put on the internet. This 
image was captured from that broadcast. 
At this time, we have no confirmed report on why the broadcast... 
The girl's mother went home. 
Even if she calls the police, it will be too late. 
I heard the news in the car. 
Everything was accomplished? 
Yes. 
The trial was cut short, but it served its purpose. 
When they search the warehouse, will they figure out what we're doing? 
It doesn't matter. 
It's too late for them to stop it. 
If everything is working on schedule, why do you look so troubled? 
Where is Behrooz? 
He went to bury the girl. 
But his car is still in the driveway. 
He didn't take the car. 
I don't understand. 
He went with Tariq. 
Tariq was here? 
Oh, my God. 
He's going to kill my son. 
Oh, my God. 
He's going to kill our son. 
Yes. 
I told Madwan that Behrooz took care of the girl. 
Madwan must not have been satisfied. 
He must have decided that Behrooz was a liability. 
How could you let this happen? 
How could you let them kill our son? 
What could I do? 
What could I do?! 
He's our son! 
Our flesh and blood! 
Dina, listen to me. 
How could you let them kill our son! 
Behrooz stopped being our son a long time ago. 
How can you say that? 
Because it's true. 
Living here has changed him. 
He's been like a stranger to us. 
He proved it to me today that he no longer believes in our cause. 
Maybe... 
he never did. 
Behrooz... 
Behrooz... Behrooz... 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Secretary Heller would like to say a few words. 
I'm incredibly privileged to have the finest people in the world behind me. 
All of you. 
It's going to take a lot more than a few words to express my feelings, but for now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. 
Secretary Heller, Curtis Manning, head of Tactical. 
Curtis. 
An honor, sir. 
Please, sit down. 
Erin, my daughter and I owe you our lives. 
It sounds like you had to make some tough calls, but you made the right ones. 
I'll see to it that you get full recognition for a job exceptionally well done. 
Thank you, sir. 
Now, before we start the debriefing, I'd like to visit with my son. 
Where is he? 
We're actually holding Richard here, sir. 
Why is that? 
When we brought Richard in, we gave him a polygraph. 
It indicated that he was possibly withholding information from us. 
About my kidnapping? 
My son and I have wildly different political views, but I can't believe that he was involved. 
We don't think he had knowing participation, but we believe he shared knowledge of your whereabouts this morning with someone, and he refuses to divulge their information or their identity. 
And what are you doing about that? 
We discussed a number of options. 
You have to understand the circumstances. 
Stop BS'ing me. What 
did you do to him? 
There's a technique that's noninvasive called sensory disorientation. 
You subjected my son to SDT? 
Yes, sir, we did. 
But it was stopped the moment  you were rescued. 
 Jack, did you know about this? 
No, sir. 
I want to see my son now. 
Of course. 
Curtis. 
Erin, I realize you've been under a lot of pressure these past few hours, but you better have cause for this. 
Jack? 
I appreciate you not involving the Secretary in the differences you and I had on this operation. 
We both did what we thought was right, Erin. 
I'd like to put the past behind us, Jack. 
I could use your help. 
What do you need? 
I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position as head of Field Ops until we avert this crisis. 
Whatever I can do to help. 
Let me make one thing clear. 
Ronnie was under my command, and you will be, too. 
Understood. 
The photos from the warehouse are they ready for Audrey Raines to see? 
I believe so. 
I'll have Edgar port them to a workstation. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Dad. 
They said you were okay. 
Audrey, too. Thank God. 
I said some awf... 
awful things before. 
I was afraid I'd never get a chance to apologize. 
I said some pretty harsh things myself. 
But, no matter what was said, you're still my son, and I will always love you. 
Me, too, Dad. 
They said they were using some interrogation techniques. 
They were totally out of line. 
I am going to sue them blind. 
I think it'll be a little more effective if you let me deal with it. 
I promise you, if they were out of line, heads will roll. 
What do you mean, "if"? 
Why did they think you were holding something back from them? 
I don't know. 
Richard, if you know something that would shed some light on what happened to me... 
What, you don't think I would tell them if I thought it was relevant? 
So there is something? 
Now you're giving me the third degree? 
Son, do you have any idea what your sister just went through? 
If you know anything that would help us find the people behind this, tell me now. 
Dad... 
I'm glad you're alive. 
I... I really am. 
But I am not going to tell these people things about my private life that they don't need to know. 
That you don't think they need to know. 
Richard, these people were trying to save our lives! 
These people can't be trusted! 
What they did to me is proof. 
Agent Manning, could you come in here, please? 
Agent Manning, I am authorizing you to do whatever you feel is necessary to get this information out of my son. Dad... 
I love you, son, but I have a duty to my country. 
You can't be serious. 
Dad! 
Bring the shovels from the back. 
Come on. Help me. 
They said it was okay to come in. 
Hi, Paul. 
My God, I was so worried. 
Are you hurt? 
No, just some cuts and scrapes, nothing serious. 
Sure? 
Yeah, really. I'm okay, Paul. 
They've okayed me for my debriefing. 
On the flight over, I couldn't stop thinking about us. 
How when we separated we said that we'd both take time to figure out what we wanted and... 
now I know. 
Paul. 
I want us to be together again. 
I'm ready to work at it. 
I'll make our marriage first priority. 
Just give us a chance. 
I'm sorry, Paul. 
That's not what I want. 
Audrey, I... 
I am a fool for bringing this up now. 
You can't make decisions about our relationship when you're in this state. Paul. 
I'm seeing someone. 
Well, how long has this been going on? 
Six months. 
You love him, or...? 
Yes. 
Audrey? 
I'm sorry. Excuse me. 
I'll come back later. 
No. Um... 
Paul, this is Jack Bauer. 
Nice to meet you. 
You're the one that saved Audrey's life. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Those photos are ready for you to look at. 
Okay. 
Um, Paul, we'll talk later? 
Yeah. 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
You ready to go? 
Not yet. 
Now i am. 
No. 
 No. 
 You're absolutely certain you saw this guy before the compound. 
Positive, and I could  tell that he recognized me. 
 Okay. 
No. 
No. 
That's all of them. 
He must have gotten out before the rescue. 
Okay, we should go through the pictures again just to make sure. 
I will, but there are only two men here who aren't Middle Eastern, and neither one of them are him. 
What? 
I just remembered where I saw him before. 
Where? 
There was a Heritage Foundation dinner about two months ago, at the Hyatt downtown, here. 
Do you remember his name? 
No, but I know someone at the foundation. 
Maybe I can get the guest list. 
 Okay, good. 
 Agent Bauer? 
Driscoll wants you in a conference call that's starting in a few minutes. 
Okay, fine. I need 
you to get ahold of the Hyatt hotel security department. 
Get access to their archival video surveillance. 
Audrey will give you a time and a date. 
Set a parameter, keep Driscoll informed. 
I'll be right back. 
It's hot. 
You brought me here to kill me! Why?! 
Why are you doing this?! 
I did everything they told me to do. 
You know why. 
I took care of the girl. Madwan knows! 
It's not Madwan that wants you dead. 
Who wants me dead? 
Who?! 
Who wants me dead? 
I want to know! Tell me! 
Your father. 
No! 
No! 
It's not true! 
No! No! 
Please! 
Please! 
No! 
Mr. Reese, 
I'm Erin Driscoll, Director of CTU Los Angeles. 
My colleagues Curtis Manning and Sarah Gavin are also present. 
Also, Jack Bauer who's Special Advisor to Secretary Heller. 
Ms. Driscoll, I 
hope you understand. 
We at McLennen-Forster couldn't give you details about that case until we received the appropriate permission from DOD. 
Understood, Mr. Reese. 
May we please begin? 
What was your courier transporting? 
It's a device we developed under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Emergency Management Program. 
It's a Dobson-type override. 
What exactly does this override do? 
It's a combination of hardware and software that can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility. 
Under what circumstances would the override be used? 
The government wanted to be able to control a plant's nuclear pile in the event of a disaster that necessitated evacuation. 
And the person in possession of this program, could they do the opposite with it, create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown? 
Theoretically, yes. 
But merely having possession of the override wouldn't be enough. There 
are safeguards in place. 
What kind of safeguards? 
Anyone who's trying to use the override would have to hack through the reactor's firewall. 
That would take massive computer power, which NRC could see coming a mile away. 
Is it possible that NRC could miss this due to unusually heavy traffic on the Internet? 
I don't follow. 
Well, less than an hour ago, millions of computers around the world were streaming the trial of the Secretary of Defense. 
Is it possible that this trial was just some kind of a Trojan horse to disguise a massive attack on nuclear power plants' firewalls? 
That might be possible. 
How many nuclear power plants in this country would be vulnerable? 
All of them. 
How many is that? 
At this time, the United States has 104 nuclear power plants online. 
We have to assume that they've used this override to take over these plants. 
Get me NRC now and find Secretary Heller. 
Thank you, Mr. Reese. 
Set up an all-department briefing. 
Get me NRC, now. 
Pipe it through here. 
I want all personnel in the conference area. 
Edgar... 
can you monitor my allocation tables for a few minutes? 
Sure. 
Yes? 
It's me. 
You're on a secure line? 
Yes. 
I would've checked in sooner. 
This was the first chance I got. 
All right. Go on. 
They find out about the override. 
24 SO4E19  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: Mars Translator: sHiN3 Supervisor: Requiem Previously On 24 There's a convoy missing. 
It was headed from Illinois to Jefferson City, Iowa. 
It disappeared just inside the border. 
Disappeared? 
They were due to call in at that checkpoint every 20 minutes. 
They didn't. 
I tried to reach them through comsat. 
There was no reply. 
What was on the trucks? 
A nuclear warhead. 
They found us. 
Where are you? 
It doesn't matter. 
It's over. 
They already got us. 
You have to kill Prado. 
He knows too much. 
Drop the gun! 
Drop the gun now! 
Put the gun down! 
Who are you? 
My name's Joe Prado. 
I'm innocent. 
Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated. 
Take me to him now. 
We have no choice, Curtis. 
Do what he says. 
There's a nuclear warhead missing. 
This is our only lead, Bill. 
What the hell's going on here? 
You've got a key witness on a missing warhead. 
We should be pressing this guy with everything we've got. 
Jack, it's Mike Novick. 
Mike, if we want to procure any information from the suspect, we're going to have to do it behind closed doors. 
You're talking about torturing this man? 
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to stop this warhead from being used against us. 
All right, gentlemen, I'll have an answer for you in 20 minutes. 
Mr. President, this thing 
could be over in 20 minutes. 
What if I could find another way to handle this that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me? 
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack. 
You don't have to. 
What do you mean? 
Accept my resignation. 
And if I do that, what then? 
Release the suspect. 
Now you're throwing me out? 
That's right. 
Make a sound and I will blow your brains out all over the windshield. 
Where is he?! 
I don't know! 
Where is he now?! 
Where's Marwan?! 
Okay, okay, okay. 
Marwan's... 
Marwan's going to be at a place called the hub club tonight. 
Where is it? 
It's... 
It's... 
Where is it?! 
It's just east of downtown! 
This will help you with the pain. 
The following takes place between 1:00 A.M. and 2:00 A.M. 
Put me through to the White House. 
President Logan? 
No, not the president. 
Mike Novick. 
One Moment Please. 
I'm sorry we're trying to locate Mr. Novick. 
Call me when you've got him on the line. 
Yes sir. 
What happened? 
Prado talked. 
Who did this? 
Audrey... 
I'm a representative of DOD. 
I have a right to know, Bill. 
Did Jack do this? 
Yes, he did. 
It was the only way to get him to give up Marwan's location. 
So President Logan gave Jack the authority to use force? 
No, Audrey, the president didn't. 
Where's Jack now? 
He's prepping a team to apprehend Marwan. 
Curtis, Castle told me you want to utilize LAPD? 
I'm having them lock down a ten-block perimeter. 
I don't think that's the right call. 
Marwan's people are coming and going. 
We lock down that area, we just give them a heads up. 
All right. 
We'll stay invisible. 
Excuse me for one sec. 
What is it? 
I just came from the clinic where they're treating Prado for a multiple injuries? 
Audrey, what do you expect me to do? 
Marwan has a nuclear warhead and he's going to use it, unless we find him first. 
I understand the situation, Jack. 
Then you know what I did was absolutely necessary. 
At least now we know where he is. 
Logan gave you a direct order not to use extreme interrogation measures without his authorization. 
Jack, you are acting against the president. 
I know. 
Jack, we're set. 
I'll be right there. 
All right, everyone, let's move out! 
I've got to go. 
Jack, you can't keep working outside the line and not expect consequences. 
Trust me. 
No one understands the consequences better than me. 
No one. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. Why? 
Just asking. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm fine. 
Look, for whatever it's worth, you did the right thing with Prado. 
Thanks. 
Authorizing the torture of a foreign national is one thing, but torturing a U.S.Citizen... I can't... 
Sir, this man Prado has information on the whereabouts of a nuclear warhead. 
We don't know that for sure, Mike. 
No, sir, we don't. 
Because you're not letting CTU do what they need to do. 
I want to wait till the attorney general gets back to me with an opinion. 
Mr. President, we are running out of time. 
Walt, you were the first one to raise an objection to this. 
What do you think now? 
I think you need to make a decision, sir. 
And sooner rather than later. 
Mr. Novick, Bill Buchanan's 
on the phone from CTU. 
He's called twice. It's urgent. 
I'll be right there. 
Yes. 
What should I tell him? 
Mr. President...? 
Stop pressing me for an answer I'm not ready to give! 
I need more time. 
I'm sorry for the delay, Bill, but the president is still working through his decision. 
The president won't have to make that call, Mike. 
What are you talking about? 
Prado gave up Marwan's location. 
I thought Prado claimed he didn't know anything. 
He did. 
He changed his mind. 
You mean Bauer physically coerced him. 
Tell me what happened, chapter and verse. 
Mike, Bauer got the information we needed. 
I think it's best if I insulate you from the details. 
The president gave explicit orders. 
You should have restrained Bauer. 
With all due respect, restraint is a luxury we can't afford right now. 
What am I supposed to tell the president? 
Convince him to sign off on the extreme interrogation, and we'll cheat the timeline in the official record. 
I made the mistake of deceiving one president; I won't make the same mistake twice. 
Even though we both know Bauer was right? 
Mike... 
Someone out there has one of our nuclear warheads. 
May I speak off the record? 
Go ahead. 
I'm worried about President Logan. 
Worried? 
Why? 
His behavior over the last few hours.. 
I'm concerned about his ability to lead us through this crisis. 
I understand. 
Yes? 
Where are you? 
At the Iowa location. 
We just arrived with the package. 
Has Sabir done the compatibility check? 
Not yet. 
Call me as soon as he's finished, and I'll have the next payment wired to your account. 
Is it compatible? 
I'll need to reconfigure the trigger mechanism. 
Is it compatible? 
Yes. 
How long will that take? 
An hour. 
Maybe less. 
Then you should start. 
My girlfriend. 
She'll leave a message. 
She's already left three messages. 
I don't want her calling around for me. 
Take the call, but hurry up. 
Nabila? 
Where are you, Sabir? 
It's the middle of the night. 
I asked you where you are. 
At the hotel. 
Stop lying to me. 
I called. 
You never checked in. 
Tell me what you're doing. 
Nabila, I can't talk about this now. 
Get some sleep, and I'll explain everything tomorrow. 
You mean after you've had time to come up with another lie? 
I found something on your computer, Sabir. 
A bookmark. 
Do you have something to do with what's been happening today? 
How can you ask that? 
Are you working with these terrorists? 
Of course not. 
You know I'm not a violent man. 
I know your politics. 
Nabila, enough. 
Stop talking nonsense. 
Is it nonsense? 
Like I said, I'll explain things tomorrow. 
Sabir, listen to me. 
She's fine. 
Don't worry. 
I want schematics on the nightclub, options for a staging area, and let county know we need traffic control. 
Thank you. 
Bill, how could you let Jack torture Prado? 
Audrey, it had to be done. 
The president made it very clear that he didn't want Prado's rights violated. 
That's right, he did make it clear, and he was wrong. 
We can't just break protocol because we think it's right at the time and expect to get away with it. 
Normally, I'd agree with you, but in this case, I'd rather ask for forgiveness than permission. 
What kind of answer is that? 
The answer is it worked. 
We got Marwan's location. 
Audrey, will all due respect, this is not Washington, D.C. 
Policy and politics do not always work on the front line, which is where we are today. 
Yes, well, Charles Logan is a politician, and he is not going to give you forgiveness. 
I hope this does not come back to haunt you or Jack. 
If what we did gets us to Marwan, we'll live with it. 
What is it? 
CTU located Marwan. 
They've sent a tactical team to grab him. 
That's good news. 
But I'm curious how they obtained Marwan's location. 
Did they use force? 
Yes, sir, I believe force was used, but I'm sure I don't need to remind you that this is an extremely time-sensitive situation. 
Who's responsible, Mike? 
I'm asking you a question, Mike. 
Who did this? 
Jack Bauer. 
I'm the President of the United States! 
I can't allow this kind of insubordination to go unanswered, especially in a time of crisis! 
I want Bauer arrested. 
I agree that that should happen, sir, but I think we should wait until we have Marwan in custody. 
No, I want him arrested now. 
Sir, Bauer is heading the field operation. 
Jack Bauer is not the only man that can do the job! 
Put someone else in charge! 
Mr. President... 
Get me secret service! 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Has Jack set the robotic camera in position? 
It should be ready in a few minutes. 
We're set to receive. 
Thanks, Curtis. 
Get this to Audrey Raines and have her stream it to DOD, please. 
Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Mike Novick. 
I just got out of a room with president Logan. 
He knows how we got the information from Prado. 
How did he find that out? 
He's not a stupid man, Bill, and I'm not going to lie to him. 
Well, you'll just have to convince him to leave it alone then. 
I tried. 
He's not going to leave it alone. 
Fine. 
Tomorrow he can bring charges against me. 
Right now, I have to get back to the business of finding Marwan. 
It's not tomorrow and it's not you. 
What does that mean? 
He wants Jack Bauer arrested. 
Arrested?! 
Mike... 
Jack is heading up the team that's trying to bring in Marwan. 
We're aware of that. 
Logan's adamant. 
He wants this dealt with immediately. 
Anything less he will take as a personal repudiation of his presidency. 
Okay, what's more important, the president's feelings or capturing the man who's responsible for everything that's happened today?! 
I hear what you're saying, Bill, but Logan's already called the secret service. 
They're on their way to take Jack into custody. 
I suggest you warn him immediately. 
Before we move in, we need confirmation Marwan's inside. 
I'll send in the remote camera, see if we can get a visual. 
What's your point of entry? 
Ventilation shaft. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Can you get the schematics for the AC configuration for the building, send it over to my pda? 
I'm on it, Jack. 
I'll send it to you as soon as I can. 
Okay The camera's working. 
O'Brian. 
We've got a Los Angeles woman reporting suspicious activities. 
First Tier wants it kicked up to you. 
Cross reference and I.D.Match? 
She seems to be who she says she is. 
Okay, send her information to my screen and put her through. 
Here you go. 
This is Chloe O'Brian, how can I help you? 
I was just telling the man on the phone, I'm not sure who exactly I should be talking to. 
I'm an analyst at CTU Los Angeles. 
Why don't you start at the beginning? 
I'm calling about my boyfriend. 
What's his name? 
You need to understand, I'm not sure if this means anything. 
You were about to tell me his name. 
Sabir Ardakani. 
We've been going out since grad school. 
Can you spell that? 
S-a-b-i-r A-r-d-a-k-a-n-i. 
Where'd you go to grad school? 
Berkeley Tech. 
We were both studying engineering. 
He's been traveling a lot lately, "business trips," he said. 
I'm not sure why I looked, probably because of everything that's been going on today, but I found something on his computer. 
Tell me. 
I think Sabir may have become involved with... 
radical groups. 
You mean terrorists? 
Yes. 
Where is Sabir now? 
He said he was going to Arizona for a client meeting, but the hotel has no record of him. 
When you looked through his computer files, tell me what you found specifically. 
Most of his files are encrypted, but there was one document in the recycle bin that's a schematic for a microchip A type I've never seen before. 
Jack, do you copy? 
Yeah. 
Buchanan wants to talk to you. 
Now? 
He says it's urgent. 
Fine. 
Go ahead, Bill. 
Jack, we've got a problem. 
Secret service is on their way over there now to arrest you. 
What are you talking about? 
Logan knows we violated his order when you after Prado. 
Bill, they can't interrupt this mission. 
You got to stall them. 
Jack, I've been on the phone for the last ten minutes. 
There's nothing I can do from here. 
You have to get Marwan before secret service gets there. 
Curtis, did you copy that? 
Yeah. 
I'll run interference. 
Give me a couple minutes. 
I'll be ready to transmit. 
Yes, we're ready. 
Excuse me, Marwan. 
I just talked to Abat in New York. 
As soon as you're done, I'll upload the tape. 
Good. 
I want this delivered to television stations by dawn on the east coast. 
That won't be a problem. 
Do you want to cover your face? 
No. 
I want the american people to know who did this. 
Ready. 
People of america, you wake up today to a different world. 
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you. 
It'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we have caused. 
But as you count your dead, remember why this has happened to you. 
You have no understanding for the causes of the people you strike down or the nations you conquer. 
You choose to meddle in their affairs without respect. 
You follow your government, unquestioning, toward your own slaughter. 
Today you'll pay the price for that ignorance. 
I have camera in the vent. 
I've got a visual on the main room. 
Approximately 50 civilians. 
Marwan won't be here, he's going to want to stay out of sight. 
Hold on, I've got a possible sentry... 
and a second possible sentry at the window, looking down on the street. 
Michelle, can you get a frame grab? 
We're working on an I.D. 
Sending a freeze frame to the facial recognition software. 
Jack, we have a match. 
He's a known associate of Marwan. 
That confirms that Prado gave us a legitimate address. 
But not that Marwan is in the building. 
We can't risk exposing ourselves till we know he's in there. 
Castle. 
Secret service is approaching your position. 
Jack, secret service has arrived. 
Did Marwan's people see them approach? 
No. 
They came up through the rear alley. 
Moving on to the next room. 
Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities, this attack will be followed by another, and another after that.. 
I've got a visual on people in the storage room. 
How many? 
Five. 
But they're talking to someone outside my sight line. 
I got it. 
All right, stand by, Jack. 
What's going on? 
Secret service. 
I'm Agent Greg Merfield, this is Agent Frank Wells. 
We know this is a highly irregular situation, but we have orders to take Jack Bauer into custody. 
Curtis, let me talk to them. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
Right now we are trying to confirm that Habib Marwan is in this building. 
He is a terrorist in possession of a stolen nuclear warhead. 
I cannot impress upon you how sensitive this mission is. 
The president was specific, sir. 
We need to pull you off this now. 
I don't think you understand. 
I am in a concealed position. 
You pull me out now, you put this whole operation in jeopardy. 
As soon as this is over, I give you my word I will go with you. 
I'm sorry, agent, if you don't come out, we're going to have to come in and get you. 
Local secret service command has confirmed the order, Jack. 
There's nothing I can do about it here. 
Jack, we don't have a choice. 
We're going to need to replace you. 
Jack, this is Castle. 
I'm heading out to you. 
Fine. 
Approach the south side of the building. 
Got it. 
Curtis, we're on the move. 
All right, be careful. 
Marwan, the police are here. 
Nasir saw an officer outside. 
Start packing. 
Hold on, I got a visual on Marwan. 
I have a visual on Marwan. 
He is in the building. 
Damn it, they know we're here. 
Everybody move on the building. 
Our cover's blown! 
Everyone, go! 
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!... 
Down! 
Down!Down!Down!... 
Everybody, get down! 
Down! Down! Down!... 
Freeze! 
Hostile down. 
I got him, Jack. 
Marwan and his men have escaped through a hole in the outer basement wall. 
Set up a two-mile perimeter, cover all utility access points. 
Bomb! 
Bomb! Go! 
Jack, what happened? 
Curtis! 
Jack, do you read me? 
Jack, you okay? 
Yeah. 
Check on the men. 
Michelle, it's Jack. 
We can't pursue, they blew the tunnel up behind them. 
It's completely blocked. 
Have LAPD tighten up the perimeter. 
Get them to tell us what this tunnel feeds into now. 
Yeah. 
Jack... 
Agent Bauer... 
Agent Merfield. 
Secret service. 
I'm sorry, but I'm here to take you into custody Hand over your weapon. 
You blew this mission. 
I'm sorry, sir, I'm just following orders. 
has anyone asked President Logan what the hell he was thinking, arresting Jack in the middle of the operation? 
Look, Curtis, we still have to focus on finding Marwan. 
We pulled up city records. 
The building is directly adjacent to a sewer line. 
How many street-level egress points are there? 
At least 30. 
Which means Marwan's probably gotten past our perimeters already. 
Yeah, well, we still have to keep looking. 
LAPD and FBI will set down a grid down there. 
I want you to coordinate your men with them. 
We just found a videotape on the man we shot. 
It's been damaged, but we should be able to recover most of what's on it. 
Well, have one of your men come back here with the videotape. 
Edgar's repositioned the satellite. 
We'll let you know if we find anything. 
You got it. 
How did Marwan get past your men? 
They had to move in before they were ready. 
Why? 
Secret service showed up to take Bauer into custody, which compromised one of our positions. 
I didn't mean... 
that's not what i meant to have happen. 
With respect, sir... 
your orders were explicit. 
What other search protocols are you running? 
None, Mr. Novick. 
We're essentially without a lead. 
Bill, give us a few minutes. 
We'll get right back to you. 
Standing by. 
This is not my fault. 
None of this would have happened if Jack Bauer hadn't disobeyed my orders in the first place. 
Sorry, sir, but if you're asking me to agree with that assessment, I can't. 
If it wasn't for Jack, we won't locate Marwan. 
CTU is waiting for us to call them back with a directive. 
What would you like me to tell them, Mr. President? 
I have no idea. 
And that's the problem, isn't it? 
It is my fault we lost him. 
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead, and I allowed him to escape. 
Mr. President... 
Stop. 
I don't even know if I deserve to be called that. 
Whatever I call you won't change the fact you are president of the united states. 
I shouldn't be. 
For the good of this country, I should resign. 
That's not an option, sir. 
Not without destroying the public's confidence, which is already at its limits. 
Three presidents in as many hours would be devastating. 
Then what should I do, Mike? 
Tell me what to do. 
There's someone who can advise you better than I can. 
You should consider bringing him in here to help you through this. 
Who? 
President Keeler is in critical condition after Air Force One crashed in the Mojave desert a few hours ago. 
A white house spokesperson reports that the president was taken to an undisclosed military hospital following the crash. 
Sir, there's a secure call coming through for you. 
Thank you, Adam. 
Hello. 
Mr. President... 
Mike? 
Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry to disturb you so late. 
I've been up all night following the news. 
This is a tragic day for our country. 
Yes. 
May I ask when you received your last intelligence briefing? 
Three hours ago, why? 
Since then, the terrorist behind today's events, Habib Marwan, has taken possession of a nuclear warhead. 
My god. 
How? 
Well, he recovered the football from the wreckage of Air Force One, and he used it to track and steal the warhead. 
President Logan feels he needs help. 
What kind of help? 
Substantial. 
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do. 
President Logan is requesting that you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made. 
A crisis is looming. 
Hard choices may need to be made, and by the president's own admission... 
he feels he may not be up to the task. 
This country is very possibly about to face the worst terrorist act in its history. 
We need your leadership. 
Before I do anything, I want to speak to President Logan face-to-face. 
Fair enough. 
We'll notify your secret service detail to bring you to the White House. 
All right, Mike. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Please step out of the car, Agent Bauer. 
What's going on? 
President Logan realized this was a mistake. 
You're free to go. 
I am genuinely sorry about all this. 
Doesn't really help us with our situation, does it? 
We had Marwan. 
Any sign of him? 
We have people all over the tunnels. 
So far, nothing. 
We had him. 
Damn it! 
We had him. 
They're not finished searching the tunnels. 
If you haven't found him yet, you're not going to. 
Too many ways in, too many ways out. 
CTU have any new leads on Marwan or the warhead? 
No. 
Great. 
Load everybody up. 
We're going back to CTU now. 
All right, everyone, let's go. 
Edgar... 
I'm busy, Chloe. 
I need you to release your system. 
Why? 
It's the only one with a random sequencer. 
You're gonna have to wait. 
I can't wait- someone called a lead in. 
And now that Marwan's escaped, I need to pursue this. 
This is more important. 
I have agents out there looking for Marwan. 
I need to reconfigure the perimeter for them. 
You don't need your system to do that. 
Just tell them to use the profiles we loaded onto their panels. 
That won't be good enough. 
Things are changing every minute. 
They're field agents, they have guns. 
They don't need you to coddle them. 
You know, that's a pretty rude attitude. 
I need your system. 
No. 
Tony. 
What? 
A woman called in, and she thinks her boyfriend may have had something to do with today's terrorist attacks. 
Did you verify it? 
No, that's the problem. 
I need to use Edgar's system. 
Why? 
Her evidence involves data that she got from her boyfriend's computer. 
It's in proprietary format. 
Well, what's Edgar doing? 
He's screwing around, moving agents that Jack and Curtis don't need. 
Edgar. 
Yeah? 
Let Chloe into your system. 
What about tactical I'm running? 
I still got guys out there. 
Marwan's long gone. 
Most of those agents you can call back in. 
Excuse me. 
Yes? 
This is Morrison. 
Is there a problem? 
I haven't heard from you. 
CTU found the club. 
How'd they know you were there? 
Must have been Prado. 
Has the warhead been reconfigured? 
Yes. 
Then our timetable remains unchanged. 
Marwan... 
we, uh, may have a potential security breach here. 
Who? 
The technician, Sabir. 
His girlfriend's getting suspicious. 
But it's being taken care of? 
Of course. 
It's been handled. 
Let me know when it's done. 
Tony. 
Yeah? 
The woman with the phone tip who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out. 
What'd you find? 
She sent us a schematic of a microchip that we did analysis on. 
It's used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads. 
Does this include the warhead Marwan has control of? 
Yes, this is the design of the chip that controls the trigger on the stolen warhead. 
What do we know about the man whose computer we found this on? 
His name is Sabir Ardakani. 
According to his girlfriend, he's recently become radicalized. 
I want his picture and I.D. 
On an all-agency distribution list, highest priority. 
She thinks he's out of state, but she has no idea where. 
Well, if he's in this with Marwan, he's probably somewhere in the Iowa region, with the warhead. 
This woman who gave you the tip, is she local? 
Yes. 
Los Feliz. 
She says that the rest of the files on his hard drive are locked. 
If that's the case, we're going to need a specialist. 
We're going to need to send a team over there as soon as possible and see what else we can dig up on him. 
All right. 
Chloe, I want you over there. 
What? 
Take a team with you, let's get on this. 
Oh, I'm not a field agent. 
I don't do that. 
Chloe? 
We need a specialist on this. 
You're the only one who can get those files off that hard drive. 
I want to know what Ardakani's doing and where he is. 
Chloe... 
I'm giving you an order- go. 
Does my panel have a live link to the tactical network? 
Not yet. 
What are you waiting for? 
We don't do that until the agent's on site. 
I'm not an agent. 
I know that, but you're attached to a mobile unit, Chloe. 
I'm just trying to do things by the book. 
Isn't always what you tell me to do? 
Why do you have to be so contrary? 
I'm just not comfortable out here. 
I want to make sure you have everything covered. 
Fine, you have your live link. 
What else? 
Trunk my audio in with Bergen and White. 
I want to make sure that I can monitor two-way between them and CTU. 
Done. 
Okay, I can't think of anything else right now, but if I do, I'm going to call you, and I really hope you don't give me so much resistance next time. 
Chloe, I know you're scared, and I'll make sure everything is covered on this end. 
Why did they ask me to do this? 
I really hate it. 
While you were prepping, I asked Buchanan if I can go instead of you. 
He wouldn't let me. 
He said you were the best analyst we have. 
He's right. 
I know. 
I'll call you if I can think of anything else. 
Okay. 
Hi. 
I'm Agent O'Brian, these are agents Bergen and White. 
You're Nabila Al-Jamil? 
Yes. 
Where's the computer? 
Please, come in. 
These men need to search the house. 
Did Mr. Ardakani keep records 
other than on his computer? 
There are some papers in the bedroom. 
This is the computer you found the chip schematic on? 
Yes, but like I told your people on the phone, the rest of his files are encrypted. 
Are you sure? 
Yes, I ran a check sum and built a subroutine to confirm. 
I have a doctorate in computer sciences. 
Okay, let's see... 
You're right. 
They used blowfish algorithm. 
How can you tell? 
By the tab on the file headers. 
Can you decrypt it? 
CTU has a proprietary algorithm. 
It shouldn't take that long. 
We'll start by trying to hack the password. 
Let's start with the basics. 
Write down nicknames, birthdays, pets anything you think he might have used. 
Okay. 
What was that? 
I don't know Go! 
Go! 
In here. 
Your men are dead. 
Open the door. 
Don't you have a gun? 
I work with computers. 
Open the door. 
Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, it's Chloe. 
This is an emergency. 
We're being shot at! 
Where are you? 
The Los Feliz location. 
We need help! 
Okay, all right... 
Jack, Curtis, Chloe's in the field. 
She's under fire. 
What's her location? 
1482 Franklin, Los Feliz. 
Curtis, how far out are the closest tac teams? 
I'm on it. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
What's your situation. 
I barricaded us in the laundry room. 
Who are you with? 
Our informant. 
Bergen and White were with me. 
Bergen's down, I don't know where White is. 
I'll call you back. 
Chloe, don't hang up the phone. 
Get her back on the line now. 
Hurry. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
I need an LAPD response at 1482 Franklin. 
We have two agents down, one under fire. 
Where are the tac teams? 
About 15 minutes. 
That's too long. 
Be open, be open... 
where are the keys? 
where are the keys? 
where are the keys? 
Jack, it's her! 
Put her on speaker. 
Jack, how far away is help? 
At least ten minutes. 
Ten minutes is too long. 
Chloe, just try to stay calm. 
Tell me where you are now. 
He's shooting at us! 
The glass is bulletproof. 
Chloe, I need you to tell me where you are. 
We're in a CTU car. 
He's shooting at us from outside. 
I don't have the keys. Can I hot-wire this? 
No, it's secured. 
But there should be weapons stored inside the vehicle. 
There's a rifle in the back. 
It's locked. 
I need the combination. 
I'm on it. 
Chloe? 
Where's going? 
Wait, I think he's leaving. 
We got the combination? 
Not yet. 
He's going to ram us! 
Oh, god! 
What's taking so long, Jack?! 
I've got it! 
It's three-one-four-three! 
Chloe, did you get that?! 
Three-one... 
What's going on here? 
What's doing?! 
Go, get out! 
Get out, get out! 
24 SO4E14  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: niuniu Translator: sHiN3 Supervisor: sHiN3 rustyapple Previously On 24 We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated. 
Where is it? 
You decide when the pain stops. 
Drop the gun or I'll kill him! 
Paul, where's the data printout? 
I hid it. 
Is this it? 
Yeah, it's in code. 
I couldn't make any sense out of it. 
We're gonna get it back to CTU. 
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here. 
Why don't bring her and everyone else up to speed. 
The man responsible for planning today's attacks, Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-forster. 
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company to inspect his computer files. 
As they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's entire data base. 
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated. 
Where do we go now? 
Weapons and ammunition. 
Get out of here or the next one won't miss. 
I'm a federal agent. 
Look, we need your help! 
Who's after you? 
It has to do with the terrorist attacks. 
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities. 
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you. 
It's time. 
Jack! 
I'm here! 
You and Raines safe? 
Yeah. 
I need you to get this to CTU. 
It needs to get decoded immediately. 
Jack, look out! 
Paul... 
Paul! 
Get me a medic! 
It is time for you to go. 
Are you ready? 
Yes, of course. 
Proceed as planned. 
The president of the united states is on a tight schedule. 
We can't be late. 
The following takes place between 8:00 p. m. and 9:00 p. m. 
He's bleeding out! 
Tell them on the ground we need two liters of a-positive hemo. 
Come on, Paul, stay with us. 
We're almost there. 
Hello? 
Audrey, it's me. 
Oh, Jack, thank god you're all right. 
Audrey, I need you to listen to me. 
Paul's been shot! 
Audrey? 
Audrey? 
How bad is it? 
The medics are working on him. 
We'll be there in a few minutes. 
Jack, how did this happen? 
We were securing the area. 
One of the gunmen tried to shoot me. 
Paul pushed me out of the way. 
He saved my life. 
Audrey? 
I'm here. I just... 
Jack, I don't know what to say. 
You don't have to say anything. 
Surgeons have been notified. 
They're standing by. 
I want you to know we're going to do everything we have to. 
You understand that? 
Yeah, I understand. 
I'm sorry. 
I got...,I got to go. 
See you in a minute. 
Yeah, okay. 
Mr. President, all the evidence 
we've gathered confirms that this man, Habib Marwan is directly responsible for everything that's happened today. 
The train derailment, my abduction, the sabotage of our nuclear power plants... 
does any of your evidence suggest that he's planning more attacks? 
I'm afraid so. 
NSA is reporting a spike in chatter. 
They're sifting through the intel now, trying to determine potential targets and time frames. 
"Trying" is not good enough. 
The chopper carrying Paul is about to land, sir. 
We need to preempt any further attacks. 
I understand, sir. 
Our best chance to do that is by capturing Marwan. 
How close are you? 
Jack Bauer recovered a document we believe contains contact data on Marwan's network. 
CTU is using it to track Marwan. 
And if that fails? 
Mr. President, we just have 
to hope that it doesn'T. 
Jim, today's events are continuing to generate an unprecedented level of fear. 
I'm not sure the social and civil fabric of this country can withstand another attack. 
We need to make provisions. 
Provisions? 
The civil unrest that I believe is inevitable in the event of another terrorist strike. 
Are you saying we should impose martial law? 
I've asked General Wakefield to meet with you in Los Angeles to discuss our options. 
When? 
Now. 
His plane landed. 
He'll be calling you to confirm a secure location. 
And, Jim... 
keep this between us. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
All right, he's losing pressure. 
I need ten CC's of adrenaline, no compression. 
Let's go. 
Paul? 
Paul, can you hear me? 
Got to get him into surgery now go! 
Paul... 
I'm sorry... 
please, tell me he's not going to die. 
Come here. 
Jack, tell me. 
We don't know. 
We just don't know. 
Jack, are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Listen, we were able to decode and pull a name of the list you sent us. 
Who is it? 
Someone on our watch list. 
But we had no idea he was connected to Marwan. 
Come on inside. We'll talk you through it. 
I'm sorry, Mrs. Raines, 
you need to stay out here while your husband's prepped for surgery. 
Please, can I just talk to him for a second? 
Paul, hey.. 
hey, it's Audrey. 
Listen to me. 
I just want you to know that I'm here, okay? 
I'm here. 
We need to prep him now. 
And I will be here when you get out of surgery. 
Do you understand me? 
Paul... 
His name's Joseph Fayed, associate professor at Green University. 
Chemical engineering. 
He came to the U.S. In 1985 
to get his graduate degree. 
We're sending in a team to pick him up now. 
That's a mistake. 
Why? 
From everything that we've seen today, Marwan's vetted his inner circle very carefully. 
That man will die before he says anything. 
You're probably right, Jack, but what can we do besides arrest Fayed? 
Send someone in undercover. 
Take a chance. 
They might lead us to Marwan. 
Come on, Jack, you know we don't have the time to put one of our own people undercover. 
I'm not talking about one of our people. 
Dina Araz. 
She's already made her deal, Jack. 
We granted her son immunity. 
We have nothing left to offer her. 
Maybe, maybe not. 
Let me talk to her while you mobilize a tactical team. 
If I can't get her to cooperate by the time they're ready, send them in, but it's simple- we either find Marwan or we will not be able to stop what he's planning next. 
Meet them at the hotel on Old River Road, half a kilometer from the base. 
When? 
Leave now. 
I'll need his entire flight package, including clearance and identification codes. 
You'll have whatever you need. 
Is that all you've got? 
Oh, for now it is. 
Oh, come on. 
I haven't seen you in two weeks. 
Yeah, I've got to get to the base. 
I'm flying tonight. 
Damn, I'm going to be late as it is. 
Look at me, I'm all wrinkled. 
I wouldn't worry about that. 
Hello. 
It's for you. 
What? 
It's your wife. 
That's your cell phone. 
Laurie. 
They've got guns, John. 
They say they'll kill the children unless you do what they want. 
What's going on, Laurie? Who's there? 
I don't know. 
Listen to me,Laurie, whoever's there, you put them on the phone. 
Please, John, don't let them hurt the children! 
Laurie... Laurie. 
Put your clothes on, John. 
Curtis is prepping the tactical teams. 
Which means you have five minutes to do this. 
Do you recognize this man? 
No. 
He's connected to Marwan. 
I don't know him. 
I already told the other agent. 
Marwan doesn't permit communication between cells. 
His name is Joseph Fayed. 
He's a professor at green university. 
You know more about him than I do. 
He's also our only way to reach Marwan. 
We can't do that without your help. 
Why should I help you? 
I've already gotten all I'm going to get for cooperating. 
That's not necessarily true. 
I know you love your son. 
You've already shown me that today. 
But unless you help us get to Fayed, that will be the last time you see him for the rest of your life. 
This is Dessler. 
All right, have them stand by. 
Tactical teams are ready. 
They can be at Fayed's house in ten minutes. 
Let's give him another minute. 
I'm offering you your freedom, Dina. 
You and Behrooz will be put in a witness protection program. 
You'll be given new names, identities, everything. 
This is a better deal than you made earlier. 
I'm offering you a life with your son. 
Right now, the only question is: Which life do you want? 
What do you need me to do? 
I need you to go to Fayed and tell him that you need to speak to Marwan. 
He won't let me through his front door, let alone get near Marwan. 
He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him. 
A hostage? 
Who? 
Me. 
So what's this all about? 
What are you doing? 
I'm delivering you to someone. 
Who? 
I don't know. 
You don't know who you work for? 
I work for myself. 
Somebody's paying you. 
I don't ask them who they are and they don't tell me. 
That's how I stay alive. 
All right, it's time. 
If you don't cooperate, your family will die. 
Do you understand? 
It's all there. 
Get out of here. 
Get your things. 
We got a plane to catch. 
Increased chatter indicates that habib Marwan is planning another strike. 
It's imperative that we locate him before he's able to trigger this. 
We are mounting an undercover operation that we hope will lead us to him through this man... 
Joseph Fayed. 
We've struck a deal with Dina Araz to work undercover for us, and approach Fayed. 
But Marwan knows we had Dina Araz in custody. 
We're trying to use that to our advantage. 
Jack will run us through the cover story we've fabricated. 
The cover story goes as follows: An hour ago, I was transporting Dina Araz to the federal detention center when my vehicle was attacked by the surviving members of a terrorist cell run by Navi Araz at the intersection of sepulveda and national. 
I managed to kill or wound all of the attackers. 
But during the engagement, Dina Araz secured one of the weapons and took me hostage. 
She'll take me to Fayed. 
Hopefully, he'll take me to Marwan. 
And if Marwan takes the bait, we track you to him. 
Yeah. 
Now we have to assume they're going to search both Jack and Dina, which is going to make tracking and surveillance devices a problem. 
We're going to have to handle this passively. 
We're going to use satellite, parabolics and laser aggregators. 
But what about Dina Araz? 
Do you think she'll be able to play this convincingly? 
Well, she's managed to live here in the united states for the past five years while part of a terrorist cell undetected. 
Yes. 
She's an expert at deception. 
As long as she doesn't deceive us. 
Right now, this is our best and only chance at finding Marwan. 
But no matter how well we fabricate this story, Jack will be in extreme and immediate danger. 
We have to be able to move in at the first sign of trouble. 
There is zero tolerance for error. 
Thank you. 
Good luck, everyone. 
Curtis... 
the detainees from McLennan-Forster have been taken over to division. 
I want you to run the interrogation. 
You got it. 
Thank you. 
Edgar... 
I want you to call LAPD and Caltrans. 
We need their logs to reflect that the ambush on Jack took place. 
I need an exact time window. 
He just finished telling us. 
An hour ago. 
I know. 
I just didn't know if there was an updated scenario. 
No, Edgar, you weren't paying attention. 
Look, we can't afford for you to be losing focus at a time like this, all right? 
I'm sick of people talking to me like I don't know what I'm doing. 
Especially people who don't really work here. 
Is there a problem with Edgar? 
Well, his mother was caught in the contamination zone at the San Gabriel Reactor. 
She took her own life. 
Now up till now he's been handling it pretty well, but I think it may be catching up with him. 
Do you think he's in good enough shape to run the comm part of this operation? 
Based on what just happened? 
No. 
Where's Chloe? 
I didn't see her on the active roster. 
Driscoll forced her to resign. 
Why? 
Well, apparently, Chloe went against Driscoll's orders, sided with Jack. 
Turns out, Jack was right. 
Thank you. 
Hello? 
Chloe, it's Michelle Dessler. 
You're calling me from division? 
Actually, I'm back at CTU. 
Secretary Heller asked me to take Erin Driscoll's place. 
She got fired? 
That's too bad. 
Listen, could you tell Edgar to upgrade the langley pattern recognition software? 
He gets a little overwhelmed sometimes. 
Yeah, I'll make sure he takes care of that. 
Thanks. 
Listen, Chloe, you're better at what you do than anyone I've ever worked with. 
I need you here. 
Thank you for saying that, but I think I've had enough for today. 
Chloe, this would be for Jack. 
not just for CTU What are you talking about? 
He's about to go undercover in a high-risk operation. 
We need to mount a massive surveillance in very little time. 
I don't have confidence that Edgar can do this on his own. 
Well, there's nothing I can do about that. 
Chloe... 
I just need a few hours of your time, and then you can move on. 
I just want to do everything I can to ensure Jack's safety. 
Fine. 
But it's just for today. 
Thank you, Chloe. 
You're welcome. 
They're setting cars up at the ambush site in case Marwan wants to verify. 
We're using the dead bodies of terrorists from Heller's rescue. 
All right, the follow team will stay as close as they can, but to tell you the truth, Jack, you're flying without a net on this one. 
If a hostile decides to take you out without warning, there's nothing we can do. 
I know. 
Look, Audrey's still at the clinic. 
There's time if you want to say good-bye. 
She's got a lot on her mind right now. 
Jack, she should know what you're about to do. 
She's been through enough today. 
Want you to look over the time line, then we'll talk through the details. 
I'm not doing anything until I see my son. 
We don't have time for that right now. 
Seeing my son is non-negotiable. 
Tony. 
You need to learn every aspect of the cover story- your life depends on it. 
Don't worry about me. 
You can see your son, but only for a minute. 
That's all. 
Let's go. 
Mom... 
they wouldn't tell me where you were, or even if I was going to see you again. 
We're going to be together. 
What are you talking about? 
They wouldn't let you come with me. 
Everything has changed. 
I agreed to do something for them, and they'll let me go with you. 
What do they want you to do? 
Help them find Marwan. 
He's too dangerous. 
Oh, I can handle Marwan. 
Please, mom... 
no. 
Don't worry. 
I'll be fine. 
Please, mom. 
Mrs. Araz, it's time. 
is field surveillance in place yet? 
We have audio. 
There might be some dead spots, but we should be able to hear inside the house. 
That's assuming they get that far. 
Okay, thank you Yeah. 
Come on, come on. 
Why aren't you going through? 
Damn it! 
Use a danziger filter. 
You can download it internally if you know what you're doing. 
There, you're in. 
Chloe, what are you doing here? 
Michelle thought you could use some help. 
Offload your task list at station 12. 
I'll cover your overflow. 
I can handle my assignment. 
Well, obviously you can'T. 
Otherwise Michelle wouldn't have called me in. 
Edgar, I meant to tell you before Chloe got here. 
Look, ms. Dessler. 
I can do my job. 
I don't need any help. 
I'm not saying you can't, but I'm not taking any chances either. 
Look, I realize we got off to a rocky start, but... 
Edgar, this isn't a debate. 
It's an order. 
Now, brief Chloe so she can run satellite with you, and do it fast. 
Jack's approaching the staging area. 
This is Baron. 
This is Dessler, we're set on our end. 
Satellite and surveillance teams are in place. 
Go in at your discretion. 
Roger that. 
We'll leave this line open. 
We're going in alone? 
Our agents are conducting audio surveillance with mobile parabolics. 
What does that mean? 
Acknowledge that you hear me. 
Copy that. 
What are you doing? 
I have to make it look like I was injured during the attack. 
Take my gun. 
This has to look as convincing as possible. 
Take my gun. 
You must know that I want to kill you. 
Yes. 
But I know you won't because of Behrooz. 
Let's go. 
They're going in. 
We're standing by. 
What if Fayed doesn't believe us? 
Then we're both dead. 
Who is it? 
Joseph, it's Dina Araz. 
Who? 
Dina Araz. 
I'm a friend. 
My husband is Navi. 
He's been killed. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Now please go away. 
I need to speak to Marwan. 
I don't know any Marwan. 
Yes, you do. 
Go away before I call the police. 
You won't call the police, and we both know why. 
What do you want? 
I have a hostage. 
Someone Marwan will want. 
His name is Jack Bauer. 
He's a CTU agent. 
Now please, let me in before someone sees me. 
Close the door! 
Put your gun over there! 
Do it! 
How did you find me? 
My husband told me. 
I don't know your husband. 
He knew you. 
Tell me what happened. 
My husband was killed and I was arrested. 
They were transporting me to CTU. 
I heard an explosion, and the van we were driving crashed. 
It was our people... 
they came to rescue me. 
Everyone fell except Bauer and me. 
He was wounded, and I managed to get his gun. 
Where did this happen? 
At the intersection of sepulveda and national. 
Half a mile from here. 
Don't move. 
What is it? 
The is Fayed. 
A woman named Dina Araz came to me. 
How did she find you? 
She claims her husband told her. 
What does she want? 
She wants to bring you a hostage. 
A CTU agent named Jack Bauer. 
Jack Bauer? 
Can you break into the other side of the conversation? 
No. The call's being piped 
through a satellite switcher. 
The signal's scrambled. 
As she was being transported our people ambushed the vehicle at the intersection of sepulveda and national. 
Everyone was killed, but she managed to escape with Bauer. 
What do you want me to do? 
Bring them to me. 
I will call you back in five minutes with the details. 
Be ready. 
Do you understand? 
Yes. 
I understand. 
Marwan wants to see him. 
Baron, it's a go. 
I heard. 
Set a follow grid, and we'll coordinate from our end. 
Evening, sir. 
Evening. 
Pop the trunk for me, sir. 
Since when are you searching officer's cars at the gate, sergeant? 
An elevated threat level. 
Okay, you're good to go, sir. 
Thank you. 
I'm on base. 
Continue to the next phase. 
Okay, I got you on base. 
Let me talk to my family. 
 Open the trunk, captain. 
 Let me talk to my wife. 
I said open the trunk. 
Please... 
let me talk to my family. 
Your family is dead... 
And so are you. 
Mrs. Raines, your husband sustained 
bullet wounds to his chest and abdomen. 
Now, we were able to extract one of the bullets, but I' called a neurosurgeon in from Cedars to help extract the second bullet. 
Why a neurosurgeon? 
Well, the bullet is lodged against his t-5 vertebrae and we want to be careful to avoid any further spinal trauma. 
I can't believe this is happening. 
I'll let you know as soon as I get any news on his condition. 
Thank you. 
Dad... 
I don't think I realized how much I cared for Paul until now. 
I know this is terrible timing, but the president has called and I have to leave. 
You'll be able to reach me on my number. 
The doctors will keep me up to speed here. 
Okay. 
I love you, Audrey. 
And I'm proud to be your dad. 
I love you, too. 
Be careful. 
Where are you taking me? 
Shut up! 
How far are we going? 
It won't be long. 
You look nervous. 
What do you expect? 
I wouldn't have contacted you if I felt I had a choice. 
And as a result, I have no choice. 
We do whatever we have to for the cause. 
So what's the problem? 
There is no problem. 
He's approaching an intersection. 
They're turning off olympic. 
Moving to next sub-channel. 
He's turning onto a side street. 
Collier avenue. 
Hold that distance. 
Understood. 
He's heading towards the broad street tunnel. 
He's slowing down. 
Baron, drop back. 
Can't afford to have them spot the tail. 
We're backing off. 
He's turning into the tunnel. 
Maintain your distance. 
He's too far ahead for the parabolic. 
I couldn't be able to hear what's going on in there. 
The tunnel's 400 yards long. 
They'll be out of satellite view for approximately 20 seconds. 
Pull in front of this truck. 
What's going on? 
Out of the car! 
What are you doing?! 
From Marwan. 
Yes. 
This is taking too long. 
We got them. They're out of the tunnel. 
Do you have a visual? 
That's it. 
We've got them up ahead. 
Fayed's turning onto Napier. 
Napier loops back around to olympic. 
That means he just spent the last five minutes driving in a circle. 
Maybe he's trying to detect surveillance. 
Chloe, can you switch to infrared? 
Hold on. 
There's only one person in the car! 
They made a switch in the tunnel! 
Baron, the covert part of the operation is over. 
All teams move in on the target car. 
Alpha team, cut him off at the bridge. We're right behind. 
Establish a perimeter around the area. 
Stop and search all vehicles. 
Chloe, do you have anything on satellite? 
Nothing around the immediate area of the target's car. 
Can you go back into archives and find out what happened? 
Yeah, it's going to take a few minutes. 
Do it. 
Baron, what's your status? 
Closing in now. 
We got him surrounded on the bridge. 
Passenger side On your left Flank him. 
Get out of the car and put your hands up now! 
Out of the car! 
Bomb! 
Oh, my god. 
Marwan set us up. 
Almeida. 
Agent Baron's dead. 
So is Fayed. 
Is there any sign of Jack? 
No, not yet. 
Any other hostiles in the area? 
The area looks secure. 
Okay. 
I'll get you another back up team as soon as I can. 
I've the archives satellite footage. 
Play it back.. 
Okay, during the time Fayed's car is in the tunnel, three vehicles exit. 
Check the van. 
Can you get me a license number on that? 
Not from the satellite. Let 
me check the traffic cameras. 
Edgar, get me the caltrans interface. 
We have a socket open. 
Logging in. 
Done. 
Okay, there's a camera at the entrance to the tunnel. 
Looking for the right frame. 
Got it. 
Send this out to all the field teams. 
I want interagency support on setting up the grid. 
I'm on it. 
We have an ID on the vehicle: White chevy van, late '90s, license plate charlie victor alpha, three-two-two. 
You've caused me a lot of trouble. 
I'm sorry for your loss, Dina. 
Navi was a great man. 
I hope my men weren't too rough with you. 
It was necessary, in case you were under surveillance. 
I understand. 
But we weren't followed, I was careful. 
You're a good liar, Dina. 
What? 
Fayed martyred himself. 
The men who were following you are dead. 
What men? 
Enough with the lies! 
Marwan, please believe me. 
I did not betray you. 
Prove it to me. 
Kill him. 
Just what I thought. 
Get him out of here. 
Previously On 24 David, what have you done? 
Excuse me, sir? 
I just got a call from the secretary of state telling me about a covert action against the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. 
That's correct. I sanctioned it. 
You authorized an attack on their consulate! That's a military engagement. 
It was a covert operation, We marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals, and in the process the Chinese consul was killed. 
Mr. President 
if we don't find that warhead before it's deployed, ten million americans could face annihilation. 
And we could be at war with a Billion Chinese. 
Is he going to make it? 
We're going to do the best we can. 
I just need him coherent long enough to get the information about Marwan and the missing warhead. 
I know, Jack. You already made me aware of that when you 
forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life. 
I'm so sorry. 
You made a choice that killed Paul, and I'm trying to deal with it. 
We both have a job, let's just do it. 
I know that he worked with Marwan on the warhead. Now he needs to tell us where it is. 
He doesn't konw. But he knows where Marwan might be. 
A factory on sixth. 
They're looking for the warhead in their cities. 
They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile. 
Start the sequence. 
We're done here. 
They can't stop us now. 
I've been waiting for this. 
You're too late. 
Kill me. 
That won't stop the missile. 
Tony, can you see this? 
Yeah. 
Can you get a source of the transmission? 
No, Jack- it's on an encrypted uplink. 
There's no way to trace it. 
The following takes place between 4:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. 
Tony,it\'s Jack,have you got a lock on the missle? 
No,we\'re still trying to find it,Jack,what\'re you gonna do with Marwan? 
We\'re gonna scan the building one more time, then I\'m gonna bring him in to the CTU, I want you to prep a holding room. 
Tony I\'m going out for comm,if you need me,get me on my cell. 
Alright,you got it! 
I want you to try to decode his files, I\'m gonna go prep the teams to look at the building. 
Unbelievable, how the hell did they manage to assemble a missle capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. 
S-series cruise missle, ,steath technology, they must\'ve smuggled it in piece by piece and then assembled it downside. 
If it\'s stealth,we can\'t track it by radar, what about the targets? 
Pull it up. 
An S-series has a range of 1800 miles which means the warhead could be delieverd from the midwest anywhere in the continent to the U.S. 
This missle traveling up speed 600 miles an hour which means it can hit the target in either coast under three hours Let\'s assume that it\'s heading for the coast, it\'s not there,could be here,start at any time. 
There are no files on this, he just received what\'s scrambled down alike. 
What else did you find? 
Nothing,it was clean, just the laptop and the cell phone. 
Ok,take this (encrypted) outta the phone, upload it to CTU,see if any other traces. 
You got it This is Bauer. 
Jack, this is president Logan. 
I\'m just been told a cruise missle,has just been launched containing the nuclear warhead. 
Yes,sir,that\'s correct Our millitary tracking devices are doing everything they can to find the trajectory of the missle ,but we don\'t have a lot to go on. 
What about Marwan,Jack? 
You think that he will break? 
That won\'t be easy,sir. 
He\'s planned and organized everything that\'s happened today, he\'s committed to his cult,he\'s prepared to die. 
I know that you are doing your best,keep me posted. 
Yes,sir. I will. 
Let the Joint Chiefs know the situation, but tell him that this should be eliminated to the intelligence community only. 
Sir, if the nuclear missle has been launched,we have to assume the washington is its target. 
What are our options? 
We don\'t have many. 
Our first priority is to establish a continuity government and start a quiet evacuation of government personnel in the city. 
Bring the cabinet members and the speaker of the house to the bunker, the congress and Pentagon should be taking to the mountain safe facility. 
Right. 
Mike, let them know that this is category one emergency, tell them nothing more, we can\'t afford the information leak. 
David, public needs to be warned,cities need to be evacuated. 
Not yet, let\'s see what Bauer comes up at first. 
He will die before he talks to us. 
I know. 
Stand down. 
You and I both know that all I wanna do right now is kill you. 
But I have my orders. 
We\'re running outta time. You win. I\'ve been instructed to ask you what you want? 
What I want is already happening. 
The death and destruction of the innocent life is means to the end. 
Why don\'t we just skip to the end. 
To the end? 
Everything that you did today, you (defer) a reason for your people,what do you want to change? 
I have no interest having a political discussion with you. 
I\'m on an unique position to make things happen, I have the ears of the president of the U.S. right now. 
You have the power to make any kind of the deal that you want. 
And I promise you, you will do more for you and your people if you cooperate with me than if you let that missle hit its target You tell me where the missle is headed, you help me to stop it, then I guarantee you that you will talk to the president, and he will listen to you,he has no choice. 
Right here,right now, you have the chance to get what you want. 
I\'ve already had,agent Bauer. 
Of till this day every elected official and citizen of America will know that america can not intervene our lives nor countries with impunity. 
Besides,your presidency means only one to mention evil. 
That\'s you see us? 
Yes, and vulnerable. 
Chloe, come here. 
What? 
You\'re never gonna believe what I just found, I got names of some calls received on Marwan\'s cellphone take a look. 
Richard Heler That\'s right secetary of denfence Heler's son called Marwan a week ago. 
Did you tell anyone yet? 
No. 
Just you. 
I'll let Buchanan know. 
With every minute that passes, the missile's target zone widens. 
We need to get updates from regional teams. 
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to hear this. 
Edgar just pulled a name off Marwan's cell phone. 
It was from a call he received last week. 
Who called him? 
Richard Heller. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
We ran the number and it came up as originating from Richard Heller's cell phone. 
That must be how Marwan knew where secretary Heller was going to be yesterday morning. 
You think Richard helped to plan his own dad's kidnapping? 
I don't know. 
Where is he now? 
Well, it's 4:00 A.M. 
He's at home asLeep, I guess. 
Where does he live, Chloe? 
Van nuys. 
We have field teams in the area? 
I don't know. 
I'll pull it up on the ip phone. 
Yes, we do. 
Dispatch them. 
I'll call secretary Heller, tell him his son's being brought back in. 
Chloe, does Audrey know about this? 
No. 
It's more of a management conversation, don't you think? 
This is o'brian. 
Your team has been issued new orders. 
You are to dispatch immediately to van nuys. 
Audrey, you got a minute? 
Yeah, sure. 
What is it? 
It's about your brother, Richard. 
Is he all right? 
I assume he is, yeah. 
What do you mean? 
We just found out that Habib Marwan got a call from Richard's cell phone a week ago. 
I'm sorry, but that's absurd. 
We don't know what it means yet, but Buchanan is sending a team over to pick Richard up right now. 
Tony, my brother was already brought in once today and he was cleared. 
Yeah, I know. 
But this call definitely connects him to Marwan and the missile. 
Look, I don't know how he got mixed up in this, but my brother is not a terrorist. 
Audrey, Richard's phone number was found in the received registry of Marwan's sim card. 
Does my father know about this? 
Buchanan's calling him right now. 
All right. 
I'm sorry. 
All right. 
I'll tell him, yeah. 
Jack, we got something. 
W hat? 
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago. 
We're sure about this? 
Yeah, they're bringing him to CTU. 
I want to question this kid myself. 
We need to get back there now. 
Put the suspect in the vehicle. 
We're headed back to CTU now. 
It doesn't matter where you take me. 
Yeah, we'll see about that. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, were you able to get anything out of Marwan? 
No, we're going to bring him back to CTU. 
We think we got a better chance of breaking him there. 
We're about ten minutes out. 
Curtis, you okay? 
Yeah! 
Can you see the shooters? 
They're on the roof behind us. 
Go! 
Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody! 
Perimeter teams, Marwan's escaped! 
He's headed towards the southwest sector. 
Chloe, what have you got on Marwan? 
Nothing he already ditched the transpo vehicle and we can't find him on satellite. 
How did his people get into that area? 
They didn't-they must have been there before us. 
Marwan secured the location. 
All right, have perimeter teams comb the nearby buildings for remaining hostiles, then shift personnel to tracking the missile. 
We lost him, Jack. 
Damn it, Tony, how? 
They dumped their vehicle on the freeway. 
In the chaos, Marwan must have gotten into another car and driven off. 
We're trying to analyze the satellite right now, but the images are too noisy. 
How does Buchanan want to handle this? 
I'm here, Jack. 
Finding Marwan is becoming less likely. 
With that missile in the air, we have to follow primary leads only. 
Right now that's Richard Heller. 
Has he arrived yet? 
No, our team's on the way to get him. 
He'll be back here momentarily. 
Bill, I want to interrogate this kid myself. 
I understand. 
I'll have him ready for you. 
Okay, we're on our way in. 
Curtis, we need to back to CTU. 
They lost Marwan. 
We're going to have to track him from there. 
What did Buchanan say? 
Richard Heller's in first position. 
We're going to interrogate him. 
Mr. President. 
Please, everybody, be seated. 
I would like to apologize for the abruptness of your removal from your homes and your offices. 
Please know that every precaution had to be taken to ensure the secrecy of your arrival. 
The U.S. Has been thrown into a category one emergency. 
A cruise missile containing a nuclear warhead has been launched and is now headed for, we believe, a major U.S. City. 
Very possibly washington D.C. 
Now, all branches of the military have been alerted and they're doing everything in their power to locate the missile and to intercept it. 
Excuse me, sir. 
You're saying that not only do we not know what the missile's target is, but you don't even know where the missile is? 
That's correct. 
When do you plan to inform the public? 
As of this time, we feel that informing the public wouldn't be in the country's best interest. 
"We" meaning who, Mr. President? 
I feel that way, Mr. Speaker. 
Doesn't the public have a right to know the truth? 
That's all I have for now. 
When I know more, an update will be given. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President. 
Yes, Don. 
S ir, I do not wish to question your decision in front of the cabinet, but I think that you're making a grave mistake in not alerting the public. 
Look, I've thought a lot about this and... 
I'm certain it's the right course. 
Well, if I may say so, sir, you do not seem certain. 
It's a difficult day for all of us, Don. 
Now, if you'll excuse me. 
Mike, what's going on here? 
Meaning what? 
Logan was sworn in a few hours ago, we're under a massive terrorist attack-he needs all the help he can get. 
He understands that and he's seeking advice from everywhere. 
Not from his cabinet. 
Or the congressional leadership. 
Give it time, Don. 
Give it time. 
Tactical's at Richard's house, they're going through his things right now. 
What about Jack? 
Jack and Curtis are on their way back. 
Someone has to tell Audrey that Jack's going to be interrogating her brother. 
Audrey's not going to want to let Jack near her brother. 
It can't be helped. 
If Richard knows something about that missile... 
it's funny, this morning Jack and Audrey were planning their future. 
Now he's responsible for her husband's death, and he may have to torture her brother. 
And yet... 
every move he's made has been the right one. 
Not if he wanted to be with her. 
Look, Michelle... 
everything that's happened here today, it's been hard going through it with you again. 
It's been hard for me, too. 
And I... 
look at what this job does the people in our positions, and I realize... 
I want us to be together again, but it's go to be away from all this. 
You want us to leave our jobs? 
We've spent the last 12 years of our lives doing this. 
Where would we go? 
What would we do? 
I don't care. 
People start over every day, if it's important to them. 
You're asking me to leave the only thing I've ever done. 
Yes... 
I am. 
This is beyond belief! 
I cannot be brought here! 
Audrey, you got to get me out of here. 
These guys broke into my house. 
This is so illegal. 
All right, Richard, listen. 
Just calm down, okay? 
Listen to me. 
Your phone number came up on the cell phone of a terrorist, all right? 
That's what they said. 
That's insane. 
You know that. 
Audrey. 
Now listen, ok, just right... 
Audrey. 
Yes. 
They have to get him into holding now. 
Audrey! 
Audrey, don't let them do this! 
Don't let them do this to me! 
Who's interrogating him? 
Jack. 
What? 
You are not going to do this. 
You are not going to torture my brother. 
I'll be right in there. 
I don't want to hurt Richard, but we're out of time he knows something, and I'm going to find out what it is. 
And what if he doesn't? 
You're aware that he called Marwan. 
It came up on his cell phone. 
There has got to be an explanation for that. 
Let me talk to him. 
You honestly believe that you can interrogate your own brother? 
It's because he's my brother, maybe I can get something out of him that you can't, Jack. 
Please, just give me five minutes. 
Please. 
Take five minutes. 
Thank you. 
Mike. 
Don. 
How's, uh, President Logan managing? 
Given the circumstances, he's doing very well. 
I noticed that ex-President Palmer is here with him. 
Yes, he brought the former President in to advise. 
Yeah, well, that's probably a good idea. 
Palmer's been at the helm in this kind of crisis before. 
He knows how to lead. 
President Logan doesn't have any problem leading, if that's what you're getting at. 
Oh, no, not at all. 
It's just that if he's not going to ask his cabinet for help, the leadership, it comforts me, somewhat, that he's in good hands. 
Is there something else you wanted to say, Don? 
Yeah, yeah, there is. 
The people elected john Keeler to run this country. 
In his absence, Logan is expected to take over. 
But if he's not up to the task, mike, it is I, speaker of the house, and not David Palmer, who steps up. 
Understood. 
And let me assure you, that's not the case. 
Logan is in complete control. 
Excuse me, Don, I got to get back. 
Sure. 
Excuse me, Mr. President. 
We may have a problem. 
What is it? 
Don Ashton. 
He's been asking a number of questions and raising concerns as to President Palmer's role here. 
That's too bad. 
We have more important things to worry about at the moment. 
Sir, as the speaker of the house, he can create problems which you don't need right now. 
Mike's right, sir. 
Don's very ambitious. 
Now that he's next in line to the presidency, he'll look to exploit any angle he can. 
He won't put his ambition in front of national security. 
No, he won't see it in those terms, sir. 
In his eyes, national security and his personal ambition are one and the same. 
What do we do? 
Show him who's in charge. 
everything set up? 
Yeah, he's ready. 
Let's do this. 
Audrey! 
Get me out of here. 
Please, tell them I didn't do anything. 
Richard, I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay? 
A missile carrying a nuclear warhead was launched by this man: Habib Marwan. 
Tell me what you know about him. 
Look, I don't know what you're talking about. 
CTU has proof that you called him last week, tuesday at 4:00 A.M. 
I don't know any Habib Marwan or anything about a missile. 
You have got to believe me, Audrey. 
Richard, that missile is in the air right now, heading toward a city. 
Please, Richard, just tell me what you know. 
I told you, I don't know anything. 
Why'd you make that phone call last week? 
I didn't make a phone call, Audrey. 
What's happened with my son so far? 
We decided to let Audrey talk to him first. 
They just got started. 
Has he confessed to anything yet? 
No, sir. 
Richard, it's not making sense. 
That call was made. 
Look, I don't know where you get your information, Audrey, but it's all bull. 
His readings are spiking. 
He's holding something back. 
Richard... 
Richard, I am begging you to talk to me, all right? 
If you don't, there is a man who will come in here and he will get the information from you. 
I saw him torture someone today. 
It's what he's trained to do. 
He won't stop hurting you until you tell him the truth. 
Please. 
Don't let them do this to me. 
Tell me what you know and they won'T. 
I don't know what you want from me. 
I don'T. 
Richard, look at me, look at me. 
We have a chance to fix this. 
This is not working. 
We don't have time to coddle him. 
Open up. 
I don't care if he is my son, he's playing games now. 
All right, Richard, this has gone far enough. 
Either you tell us what we want to know or I will let them use every piece of equipment they have to drag it out of you. 
You understand that? 
Dad, don'T... 
Audrey, leave the room. 
Dad, please... 
now! 
I mean it. 
Richard, I want you to tell them everything you know, please. 
Now what's it going to be, Richard? 
Go to hell. 
I didn't do anything wrong, I don't have to tell you anything. 
There's a nuclear warhead going to detonate somewhere over this country. 
Those lost lives will be on your head. 
You will be a murderer. 
I didn't mean to do anything wrong. 
I swear. 
What did you do, Richard? 
Tell me what you did. 
A week ago, I was... 
I was at a bar and... 
there was this girl and her boyfriend... 
okay? 
Right. 
What were their names? 
I don't know. 
They wanted to party and I... 
we... 
we went back to my place. 
We got high... 
then... 
I guess there was time for one of them to make a call on my phone. 
How? 
When we were in bed. 
So while you were in bed with her, he used your phone in the other room. 
He wasn't the one in the other room, dad. 
I was with him. 
She must have been the one that made the call. 
So, you were set up? 
Yeah. 
I guess so, dad. 
Did they leave you with a number or an address? 
No. 
What kind of a car were they driving? 
They didn't have one. 
I drove. 
Where did you drop them off afterwards? 
I didn'T. 
They took a cab. 
Do you remember the name of the cab company? 
No, dad, I don'T. 
Get in touch with every cab company that works in the area. 
I want their log books. 
Get me a sketch artist now. 
I'll run it. 
Take over. 
So now you know. 
I suppose you're even more disgusted with me, huh, dad? 
This is not about how you choose to live your life, son. 
This is about how you've put this country in jeopardy. 
If you had told us this information yesterday, maybe these terrorist attacks would not have occurred. 
No, don't you put that on me, dad. 
'Cause yesterday I didn't know that that night had anything to do with these attacks. 
You should have told us everything. 
I'll wait outside. 
You made a profound mistake today, Richard. 
Based on this information here, we can start to develop a contingency plan. 
You got the cab company? 
Better than that. 
We got the cab driver. 
He dropped the couple off at an apartment complex in panorama city called the mercerwood. 
Did you talk to the apartment manager? 
Yes, we gave him a description of the guy and the girl. 
He says he knows what unit they're in. 
Okay, Jack, you take this. 
I'm gonna need our best field ops. 
I want Curtis and castle. 
I'm going to need Curtis here with me. 
Then you got to give me Tony. 
All right. 
What about the phone call to Marwan? 
I used our digital comm software to analyze Richard's phone. 
The phone call to Marwan activated a listen-in. 
He was able to hear all of Richard's calls after that night. 
That's why Marwan knew that secretary Heller was visiting Richard off book yesterday. 
Anything on the missile? 
We've been running military protocols, but so far nothing. 
Do we know if President Logan is going to make an announcement? 
As of now, the President still thinks that would do more harm than good. 
Please, as you were, everybody. 
Be seated. 
Gentlemen and ladies, considering the crisis that we face today, I felt it prudent to enlist the assistance of ex-President Palmer. 
In what capacity, sir? 
Excuse me. 
Sir, everybody in this room has a title and specific function. 
Exactly what position will President Palmer be occupying? 
I'm here solely as an advisor. 
Not only to the President, but to anyone here who requests my counsel. 
President Palmer's outside the chain of command, if that's what you're asking me, Don. 
Asking for a clarification, sir. 
The missile carrying the nuclear warhead was launched from a location in central iowa. 
It's becoming more and more likely that the target is on or near one of the coasts. 
It's clearly going to be new york or D.C. 
Why aren't we evacuating those two cities? 
I disagree, jennie. 
It's not clear. 
And if you start to evacuate these two cities, then you may have an unauthorized mass exoduses of boston, philadelphia, baltimore, atlanta... 
that's a situation I don't think the President should be dealing with. 
Maybe the President should be telling us that himself. 
Please, Mr. Speaker, 
I've discussed this option with a number of domestic experts including President Palmer, and that's my assessment as well. 
What about air defense? 
We going to stand by and let the airspace over these cities remain undefended? 
We have a limited number of f-18 interceptor jets at our disposal. 
They need to be augmenting the search for this missile, and not deployed in a wait-and-see mode. 
Mr. Palmer, I'm sure that we all appreciate your desire to help, 
but the constitution has determined who the decision makers should be at this time. 
I think you're overstepping your bounds. 
In the first place, it's Mr. President, Don. 
And it is the content of my statements you should be addressing. 
David. 
It's true, you are to be addressed as President. 
It's an expression of respect, but not a functional title. 
I understand that, sir. 
But you have to understand, I've been through this crisis before. 
Yes, but we are here now. 
The appointed and the lawful representatives of the people of the united states. 
Mr. President... 
David, there will be no more discussion on this matter. 
Your point has been taken. 
However, Ashton has made a good point, and I want to address his concerns. 
Perhaps it's best if I excused myself. 
Perhaps. 
Ladies, gentlemen... 
Mr. Speaker, I think you're right. 
We'll put those jets over D.C. 
And new york. 
Did you see it on the inside feed? 
Yes. 
It went exactly as you'd hoped. 
We won't have any more problems with Don Ashton today. 
I hope you're right. 
We'll be monitoring everything on three. 
All right. 
Make sure LAPD's there when we land. 
We're going to need transport to the site. 
They've already been called. 
ok Tony, wait. 
I-I can'T... 
I can't spend another day without you. 
I'm ready... 
to leave here. 
I'm ready to go with you. 
Tony. 
Be careful. 
Right. 
They're setting up a remote feed. 
Richard's going to help Jack identify the suspects when they get onsite. 
Then what? 
Then they'll let him go. 
His motives certainly weren't seditious. 
Dad, I feel so lost. 
I know, sweetheart. 
Ms. Raines? 
Yes. 
Jack Bauer's on line two for you. 
Thank you. 
You take it, sweetheart. 
I'll be on the floor. 
Hello. 
Audrey, it's Jack. 
I know you don't want to talk to me right now, but there are a few things I need to say. 
All right. 
Look, I know with everything that's happened today, you've seen me do things that... 
before now, you thought were unimaginable. 
I would have been happy to skip today. 
Yeah, me, too. 
But the truth of it is,Audrey, I never believed you could ever really love me if you'd known about everything I've done. 
Jack, I-I can'T... 
Audrey, please, let me finish. 
These were the things that I was running away from. 
That's why I moved to D.C. 
That's why I stopped doing field work. 
That's why i don't work at CTU. 
All I know is that you're back in it, and it's too much for me, Jack. 
I know. 
I know... 
the last thing i ever wanted to do was push you away from me. 
God, Audrey, I love you, but this is how the job has to be done. 
I just want you to know how sorry I am that it had to involve you and the people you care about. 
Look, you don't have to say anything now. 
Please, just promise me, as soon as this is over... 
we can talk about everything that's happened. 
Audrey, please. 
Jack. 
I gotta call you back later, okay? 
All right. 
Yeah. 
Jack, tactical's just got the schematics ready. 
What are the approach parameters? 
They want us to go in from the west. 
Edgar. 
This is the composite the sketch artist made based on Richard Heller's description. 
Get it to Jack and Tony. 
Will do. 
Now can we go? 
We still have plenty of time to get to Marwan. 
I don't like cutting it this close. 
This is a sketch of the guy that Richard Heller described. 
He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan, so once we identify the suspects, it is vital that we take them alive. 
Manning. 
Curtis, it's Jack. 
We're getting ready to land. 
Is everyone set? 
Yeah. 
We're all set. 
Richard's ready to make a positive I.D. 
Copy that. 
I want you to stay on this channel. 
You got it. 
We're a go!. 
I need you to make sure that no LAPD units go inside our established perimeter! 
Am I clear?! 
Yes sir! 
Okay, let's go! 
Are you ready? 
They found us. 
What are you talking about? 
A helicopter just landed a block away. 
So what? 
So- they found us. 
Damn it! 
Hey, we can't go together. 
Why not? 
Because one of us has to stay here in the apartment. 
Why? 
Because if they think that we're still here, then it gives the other a chance to escape. 
You've got to be joking. 
One of us is going to get caught to save the other? 
Exactly. 
It's gonna be you. 
Jack, what do you want to do? 
Move in on the apartment immediately? 
No, I want you and castle to take up positions here on the roof of the main building in the center of the complex. 
Team A, B and C, acknowledge when you're in position. 
Team A on site (B C in position) Copy that. 
Let's go. 
Okay. 
Lapd, I need the entry code for the south gate. 
I'm in. 
Okay, I've got a visual on the apartment. 
There's activity inside. 
Macallan, meet me at the front door of the apartment. 
Have your people cover us. 
On my way. 
Go. 
Go. 
Pick it. 
It's ready. 
Put your hands where I can see them! 
Put your hands where I can see them now! 
He's dead. 
Get a picture of him. 
Send it back to CTU. 
Got it. 
Tony, this is Jack. 
Has anybody reported any outside movement? 
No. Why? 
The man is dead. 
The girl is no longer in the apartment. 
She couldn't have gotten past the perimeter teams. 
I know, but there are plenty of other places to hide. 
I want all teams to maintain their positions until we have time to search the other apartments. 
Roger that. 
All teams, hold position. 
Drop your gun. 
All right! 
All right. 
Kick it away. 
Look, he's injured. 
Why don't you let him go? 
You can take me instead. 
Your two-way. 
Turn around. 
On your knees, hands on your head. 
Cuff him. 
Get up. 
Curtis, you should have it. 
Whoa. 
Is that him? 
Is that him?! 
Yeah. 
Jack, that's him. 
We have a positive id on the picture. 
Okay, thank you, Curtis. 
Tactical, this is Bauer. 
I need five teams of two to initiate a search of the complex. 
Start with the outer buildings along the perimeter, move your way in. 
Copy that, they're being deployed now. 
Tony, this is Jack. 
We're initiating the search. 
Tony, do you copy? 
Castle, why is Almeida not on comm? 
Tony you copy? Tony come in! 
All teams, this is Bauer. 
Castle is down Almeida is missing. 
I repeat: Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage. 
Our communications have been compromised. 
Move over to secondary frequency. 
CTU, I need more tactical personnel now. 
CTU, do you read? 
Michelle. 
You heard him, people. 
Shift profiles. 
We may have a hostage situation. 
Move. 
Now! 
Caption By Dean From F6 Rearranged By allanmauwx From TLF Perviously on 24. 
Who is this? 
Andrew, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I work for Secretary of Defense Heller. 
Secretary Heller was kidnapped less than half an hour ago. 
I believe the same people that kidnapped him are the ones that are chasing you now. 
The safest thing for you to do right now is let me bring you in. 
I found the person who stumbled onto our server. 
Is he with you now? 
No, I'll have him shortly. 
Find out who he's talked to. 
Who are you? 
I'm the man that's going to kill you if you don't follow my instructions. 
This is a simple task, Behrooz, but these are the ones where mistakes can be made. 
Debbie, what are you doing here? 
I followed you. 
Omar saw you with someone outside the compound. 
She didn't see anything. 
I made sure of it. 
We've spent years planning for this, waiting for this day to come. 
Now it's here and you've compromised everything. 
It's a simple job, Ronnie. 
You pick up the subject and you bring him in. 
Bauer has not been in the field for a year and half, okay? 
Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash. 
For the record, Jack, I think Driscoll made a mistake letting you come along. 
You get the gate. 
I'll get the kid out of the car. 
My father's the Secretary of Defense. 
Richard, right now you're the only witness to your father and your sister's kidnapping. 
We need your help. 
You don't have anything to hide, do you? 
HELLER: We'll be fine, Audie. 
We're still on U.S. soil. 
What are they going to do to us? I don't know, 
but if they wanted me dead they would have killed me at Richard's house. 
Our soldiers have taken the terrorist James Heller into custody. 
In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity. 
If he is proven guilty, he will be executed, in accordance with our laws. 
As you are all aware, the Secretary of Defense and his daughter have been kidnapped by a terrorist cell. 
The terrorists have announced that they will put Jim on trial for war crimes, then execute him. 
All of it broadcast for the world. 
Make no mistake, this country is under attack. 
Foreign terrorists are operating on our soil. 
And intelligence indicates that the kidnapping may be some kind of trigger, the first step in a series of larger attacks. 
Mark, what kind of protective actions are being taken? 
We've changed all the codes and protocols the Secretary has knowledge of. 
Also, the other Cabinet members have been sequestered. 
All right. 
Melissa? 
Where are we with trying to keep these people from broadcasting? 
The media outlets will all cooperate and not air it. 
But the terrorists have announced that they will use the Internet, and we cannot control that. 
They're using technology that makes their feed untraceable, and we can't shut down the Internet without disabling the command and control functions of the government and the economy. 
Mr. President, the only way 
to stop this is at the source. 
We have to find the terrorists, and rescue Secretary Heller. 
Erin, where is CTU on this? 
We have search teams out in force and we're working a few active leads, sir. 
Anything promising? 
We'll know very shortly, Mr. President. 
Keep us closely posted. 
Ladies and gentlemen, nothing takes priority over finding the people who have Jim Heller and stopping them. 
Thank you. 
Where are we with Heller's son? 
We're still trying to find out what he knows. 
If he had anything to do with his father's abduction, we need to know. 
Get on it. 
Then try his emergency frequency. 
What's going on? 
Where's Ronnie and Bauer with the witness? 
We don't know. 
What? 
I just got off the phone with transit. A hostile 
intercepted Andrew Paige at the station. We 
can't reach Ronnie or Jack. What do you mean you can't 
reach them? They're not answering 
their phones and there's been a report of a shooting at the station. I'm checking 
for an update right now. 
Get recent pictures of Andrew Paige and get them to our people on the ground. 
Also set up a security grid around the station. 
My system's already logged on to the station. 
I can get it faster. 
All right. Fine. 
You do tactical with me. 
Let's go, Edgar. 
Edgar Stiles. 
Miss Driscoll. 
Jack Bauer's on line one. 
Where are you? Why have you 
and Ronnie not been in contact? 
Erin, Ronnie's been killed. 
What are you talking about? 
He was shot by a hostile who kidnapped Andrew Paige. 
Where are you now? 
I'm in transit. I'm tracking 
them, but he doesn't know it. 
Give me your location, and I'll send backup to apprehend him. 
Erin, I don't think that's the right call. 
I believe if I follow them, they're going to lead me to Secretary Heller and the men who kidnapped him. 
Listen to me. 
Terrorists have just announced that they are going to try and execute Heller in less than three hours. Bring 
the man in now. 
Right now this is our best chance of finding him by then. 
Jack, we had a deal. 
Erin, you're breaking up. 
Listen, have SWAT and rescue teams standing by. 
I'll call you as soon as the hostile reaches his destination. 
That call do you have a location? 
No, it had a block on it. 
I've just been informed that Ronnie Lobell has been killed in the line of duty. 
The killer was a hostile connected to Heller's abduction. 
At this point, Jack Bauer is no longer cooperating with this investigation. 
All departments need to be working on the location and capture of Jack Bauer and the hostile that he's tracking now. 
Sarah, I need you to reconfigure the grid and to include routes away from the station. 
I want all ground teams on this. 
MTA Downtown. 
This is Chloe O'Brian from CTU. 
Do you have any new information about the kid who was abducted from your station? 
No, we told you everything we had a few minutes ago. 
What about surveillance cams? 
I can access them if you give me the port codes. 
We're looking at them right now, Miss O'Brian. 
There's nothing. 
Thanks. 
Yes? 
What are you doing there? 
I need you to help me with this grid. 
What kind of help do you need? 
The northeast quadrant is pass-coded and I don't... 
Pilot L-1. 
What? 
That's the log in. 
Chloe could you just get back here? 
My friend Andrew, who I promised would be okay, do you mind if I try to find him? 
Get down! 
Yes? 
I have the programmer. 
Good. We need to know 
what he told CTU as soon as possible. 
Proceed as planned. 
Understood. 
There was a problem at the train station. 
What happened? 
A federal agent interfered, I killed him. 
Are you being pursued? 
No, anyone that left the station after me would have caught up to me by now. 
Unless they don't want you to know they're there. 
Take precautions. 
Make sure that you are not being followed. Go. 
Move! 
Dad. 
You okay? 
Did they hurt you? 
No. 
They just wanted me present while they broadcast an announcement. 
They're going to put me on trial. 
For what? 
Crimes against humanity. 
That's ridiculous. When? 
Less than three hours. 
Dad, I'm sure that Jack and the President are doing everything they can to find us. 
Maybe they'll get here before then. 
I can deal with anything these bastards have got for me. 
I wish you hadn't come this morning, that's all. 
This is a list of the offenses you are being charged with. 
Sign it. 
I'm a senior member of the United States government. 
I'm not signing it. 
Then you will die, Mr. Secretary. 
Pick up the document and sign it. 
No! 
Let her go. 
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch. Come on! 
Leave her alone. 
Kill her! 
All right. 
All right! I'll sign it! 
Pick up the document. 
Pick it up. 
Where are we on finding Bauer? So far nowhere. 
That's unacceptable. There are 
a lot of places he could be. 
We're working up everything we can. 
What else are you doing to find Heller? 
After I'm done here I'm going to find out what his son Richard knows. 
Sarah's working on the forensics from the kidnapping. 
Have you gotten anything new yet? No. 
Great, what else? 
Sarah Gavin. 
We're trying to trace the origin of the terrorist web cast. And? 
The code's been braided, and I can't get into the system file. 
In other words, nothing. 
Ms. Driscoll, 
it's the President. 
Make something happen. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
I understand you lost one of your field operatives. 
Yes, we did. 
Did the engagement yield any witnesses or prisoners? 
Not yet, but there's some hope. 
Tell me. 
Jack Bauer, who as you know used to work here, is currently in the field trailing a suspect. 
Trailing him? 
Why doesn't he bring him in? 
We're in the process of doing that, sir. 
Erin, are we going to be able to save Jim and his daughter before this... trial starts? 
I certainly hope so, sir. 
Mr. President, 
I have to ask you something now because we may not have time later. 
What is it? 
We may find ourselves in a situation where we have Heller's location but can't extract him safely. 
If that's the case, would you authorize, in advance, an all-out assault? 
The assumption being that the Secretary would not survive? 
Correct. 
We'll cross that bridge if the scenario presents itself. 
Yes, sir. 
Good-bye, Erin. 
Manning. 
Hey, Curtis. 
It's Maryanne. 
Look, I know you're busy with the Heller kidnapping. 
Yes, I am. 
My friend Aileen said you're calling in level-five consultants today because you're overloaded there. 
We added some personnel because of the crisis. 
She said you struck my name from the list. 
Why? 
You don't meet the criteria, Maryanne. 
Don't give me that, Curtis. 
I have the qualifications and I have the clearance. 
Why'd you exclude me? 
All right, you want it straight? 
I don't think we'd work very well together. 
Why? Because we slept together 
a few times and you stopped calling me? 
I stopped calling you because I realized you were using me to get ahead in your career. 
That's your interpretation, Curtis. 
And you didn't seem to have a problem with it at the time. 
I'm not going to have this conversation. 
Fine, I'll have it with Erin Driscoll. 
Maryanne... Consulting with 
CTU would be a huge opportunity for me, Curtis. 
And I'm not going to let you get in the way because you're uncomfortable. 
Where should I post those FBI bulletins? 
At two-three. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's me. 
Can you talk? 
Jack, what the hell happened with Andrew? 
Someone got to him before we could pick him up. 
Did you tell anyone at CTU where we were supposed to meet him? No. 
What are you doing, Jack? 
Driscoll just announced you're operating outside her authority. 
I don't have a choice, she's not handling this the right way. 
What if you're wrong? 
I'm not. 
This is the best chance we have of finding Secretary Heller. 
Jack, if anything happens to Andrew... 
Chloe, I'm doing the best I can, but right now our first priority is to find these terrorists. 
So why are you calling me? 
The hostile's headed towards the canyons. 
I'm going to need satellite surveillance to help me track them without being seen. 
You want me to steal satellite bandwidth from CTU, without anyone knowing? 
Yes. 
Where are you? 
I'm on Orchard Road just north of the 14 about four miles east of Valencia. 
Okay, Caltrans has traffic cams in the area, but you will need satellite coverage once he gets closer to the canyons. 
Call me back as soon as you've got the coverage. 
I'll keep a private channel open. I will. 
Who was that? 
It was personal. 
Something wrong? 
I'm not sure. 
Chloe's acting kind of strange. 
That's nothing new. 
Hey, what do you need? 
I just got off the phone with Maryanne Taylor. 
Erin, whatever she told you, it's coming from a very disturbed place. 
That may be. 
But she's as qualified as any of the others you brought in today. 
I'm not comfortable working with her. 
That should be enough for you. 
Normally it would be. 
However, she mentioned that your pillow talk included a synopsis of the new data mining protocols. 
That's a lie. 
If she got that information, it was from someone else. 
Now she's using it against me. 
She knows details about the new UVX system. 
That's classified information. 
She could force us into a section one security reboot and drag us through a six-month investigation. 
I don't believe this. 
I asked her to come in. 
Deal with it. 
Do you have the results on Secretary Heller's son yet? 
Yeah. 
The polygraph makes clear he didn't have any knowing involvement in his father's kidnapping. 
But...? 
He's still insisting he didn't tell anyone his father was coming to his house this morning. 
The polygraph was inconclusive on that claim. 
You think he's lying? 
It's possible. 
Richard was the only one who knew where his father would be this morning. 
And he may have told someone about it. 
Why would Richard protect somebody who's betrayed him? 
Because he's too arrogant to believe that's what's happened. 
It'll take days to go through his phone records. 
I want you to see if you can get the name out of him another way. 
What do you mean? 
You know what I mean. 
Erin, we're not even sure if he's guilty of anything. 
This is how we'll find out. 
Get started. 
Did Father talk to you about Debbie? 
What about her? 
When Dad told me to take the briefcase to Omar... 
Debbie followed me. 
She didn't know where I was going. 
She just wanted to talk. 
Debbie saw the warehouse where we're holding Heller? 
Yes. 
But there wasn't anything I could do about it. 
You could have broken up with her months ago like your father and I told you to. 
I know I made a mistake, but Father found out she was with me and now he wants me to get her over here. 
You know what that means. 
If he thinks there's the slightest chance she could expose what we're doing... 
I didn't realize you felt so strongly about her. 
She's not going to mess anything up, I swear to you. 
What do you want me to do? 
Talk to him. 
He'll listen to you. 
Please. 
Okay. 
Your father's on his way to a meeting. 
I'll try to reach him. 
Thanks, Mom. 
When can I get out of here? 
Secure him. 
What the hell are you doing?! 
Get your hands off me! 
Who else knew your father would be at your house this morning? 
I told you, no one. 
What, are you crazy? 
CURTIS: This works on the neurotransmitter level. 
It makes every nerve ending in your body feel like it's on fire. 
You're bluffing. 
You know you can't get away with this. 
And by the time you're released, the mark on your arm will be gone. 
It'll just be your word against mine. 
My father is the Secretary of Defense, for God's sake. 
I thought you hated him. 
Now he's dear old dad? 
Help me! 
Somebody! 
Please! 
Help me! 
Stop. 
I can't do it, Erin. 
I'm not going to let Eric work on Richard Heller. 
Why not? Maybe he's protecting a friend, 
but he wasn't knowingly involved with the terrorist. 
It's an inappropriate use of force. 
I gave you an order. 
Then give it to me in writing, Erin. 
What are you suggesting, Curtis, that we release him? 
No. 
I've seen good results with sensory disorientation. 
Cut off his sight, saturate his auditory. 
It's noninvasive. 
Fine. 
Try it. 
Yes? 
DINA: I just spoke with Behrooz. 
He told me about the problem with his girlfriend. 
He's very upset, Navi. 
That's what concerns me. 
He has feelings for this girl, despite what he tells us. 
Now she's seen the warehouse. 
I know. 
It's very troubling. 
I told him to get her over to the house so we can question her. 
Did he make the call? 
No, he asked me to talk to you instead. 
Hmm. 
Go upstairs. 
What are we going to do? 
Are you talking to Father? 
I'll talk to you soon. 
You'll take care of this? 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
What did he say? 
Do I still have to call Debbie and get her over here? 
No. 
Thank you, Mom. 
I'm going to pull over soon, and we're going to talk, okay? 
Good. 
There's some things I need you to know. 
Today is not about me or you. 
It's about something bigger. 
What I need to know with certainty, is that whatever you saw on the Internet will not interfere with what we have planned. 
You have to convince me of that. 
Yeah? 
It's going to be a while on the satellite. 
Ever since Heller was taken, the load is through the roof. 
How much longer? 
I'm not sure yet. 
What is your current position exactly? 
I need it to update the request. 
Suspect pulled over just past mile marker 31. 
What did he get off for? 
There's nothing there. 
I don't know, Chloe. 
I've got to go! 
Get back to me as soon as you've got the satellite coverage. 
Jack, I'm watching this. 
How? 
On Caltrans' traffic cam. 
You've got to stop this. 
If I intercede right now, we lose our opportunity to find Secretary Heller. 
What did you tell CTU? 
That someone was preparing to distribute some kind of positioning code on the Internet. 
What else? 
I tried to dig deeper, but everything was in some kind of Arabic. 
I couldn't read it. 
That's all you told CTU? 
Yes. I promise. 
Ah! 
Are you sure? 
Jack, stop them, just stop them. 
That's all I know. 
I swear, I promise. 
Please, just don't hit me anymore. 
Please. 
I talked to the programmer. 
I don't think there's a problem. 
He didn't tell CTU enough for them to be able to stop us. 
Are you sure? 
Yes. He only got a brief 
glimpse of the code. 
He was never logged on to our server. 
I need you here. 
Get back on the road. 
Have them see what else they can find out, and then get rid of the body. 
I will see you soon. 
Chloe, how do you open a secure pipe to Division? 
Ask Edgar. 
I did. He's busy. 
Well, I'm busy, too. 
Why are you always so impatient with everybody? 
Not everybody, just you. 
Now please go away. 
Bitch. 
Jack, what's happening? 
The hostile's moving. 
I've got to follow him. 
Jack, you can't leave Andrew there; they'll kill him. 
Jack? 
Jack, please. 
Jack. 
Jack? 
Jack? 
Yeah. 
Is Andrew alive? 
Yes. Dispatch an ambulance 
to this location. 
Get me the damn satellite coverage! 
That's right, just off the road next to the 31-mile marker. 
Please get there as fast as you can. 
What's wrong? 
When the trial begins, you may have an opportunity to escape. 
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous. 
Maybe we'll have a chance before then. 
They're never going to take their eyes off of me. 
It has to be when their attention is on the trial. 
I don't want to get out of here without... 
Forget about me. 
You have to take every chance. 
Promise me. 
Dad, I-I... I ca... 
Yes, you can. You can. 
I want you to live your life, a full life. 
I want you to have a family. 
That's all I care about. 
You're my baby. 
I can't do it. 
Yes, you can. 
You can do it. 
Come on now. 
Chloe, you want me to get that? 
No. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's me. 
I was just looking at the C.H.P. dispatch report. 
Andrew is in really bad shape. 
I will never forgive you. 
Do you hear me? 
Chloe, I understand how you feel, but you've got to think through this clearly. 
We have terrorists on U.S. soil. 
They've bombed a train, and they've kidnapped the Secretary of Defense. 
Right now our only chance is to follow this hostile and hope that he leads us to Secretary Heller. 
No, I'm not listening to you anymore. This is over. 
I'm going to Driscoll. No, you won't, 
Chloe, because you know I'm right. 
No, I don't. 
Chloe, if you didn't believe in what I was doing, you'd have turned me in already. 
I hate that this is happening. 
So do I. 
Chloe, I can't do this without you. 
I need your help to stop them. 
Chloe. 
What? 
Are you with me? 
Yeah. 
I'll call you as soon as I have the satellite. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Miss Driscoll, this is Maryanne Taylor. 
Thank you. 
Hi, Miss Taylor. 
I'm very excited to have this opportunity to help you here. 
Hello, Curtis. 
Maryanne. 
Curtis, take Maryanne to an empty station, and get her started on the data sorts. 
Let's go. 
You'll be working over here. 
You know, Curtis, I didn't want to go over your head, but you left me no choice. 
Is that so? 
I'll let it go if you will. 
Get to work, Maryanne. 
Is there a problem? 
No. Why? 
What are you working on? 
Division protocol manifest. 
I need you to build a firewall around station four. 
Who's that? 
Her name is Maryanne. 
I just want to make sure she doesn't stray outside the area of her assignment. 
Fine. 
Chloe, what's going on? 
O'Brian. 
I don't think I can do this, Jack. 
Why, what's the matter? 
Curtis has me spread too thin, and I've got to get you a satellite on an overloaded system. 
I need more time. We 
don't have more time. 
In five minutes we're going to be coming up on Route 11. 
It's a two-lane road. 
We'll be the only cars for miles. 
There's no way I can follow him without being seen. 
All right. 
I think I know a way I can speed this up. 
I'll get back to you. 
Chloe, the satellite subsystem tanked and Driscoll wants these updates, like, now. 
Okay, I'll be right there. 
I hope Driscoll doesn't get too upset. 
She really overreacts sometimes. 
Oh, this happened to me a few days ago. 
You can retrieve all your files from the auto backups in the server room. 
Good idea. 
Yeah? 
All right, I managed to steal you a block of time, but there's no continuous coverage in the area you're in. 
I'll have to order a reposition. 
Fine, then do it. 
Hold on. 
Looks like we're catching a break. 
He's pulling into a gas station. 
I hope he stays there a while, 'cause this is going to take some time. 
Get back to me as soon as you got it. 
Okay, I will. 
You're Edgar, right? 
Yeah. 
Hi, I'm Maryanne Taylor. 
Erin Driscoll asked me to come in and help on data logistics. 
Yeah, I heard something about that. Hi. 
Hi. So, um, can you do me 
a favor? 
A favor? 
Yeah, you know, everyone's really busy and I just feel like I'd be more useful if I had an overall on what's going on today. 
The Secretary of Defense has been kidnapped. 
I know that. 
I mean tactically. 
I really don't have time for this. I'm a little busy. 
Why don't you just give me the main points, okay? 
All right, we think Jack Bauer is following one of the terrorists. 
We think? Yeah, it's a 
little loose right now. 
He's off on his own doing this, and we can't find him. 
I thought Bauer didn't even work here anymore. 
He doesn't. 
Driscoll gave him the authority to do this one thing. 
All right. 
Thanks, Edgar. 
Richard... 
how long do you think it's been? 
What? 
How long do you think you've been sitting here like this? 
Three, four hours. 
It's been less than 30 minutes. 
Time is the first thing you lose track of with sensory disorientation. 
And it only gets worse. 
This is illegal! 
You can't keep me here. 
You'll be here until you tell me what I need to know. 
I told you everything I know! 
Your father was kidnapped by terrorists. 
Our polygraph analysis tells us that you're hiding something that might help us find him. 
Just tell me what it is and all this stops. 
You're not going to do this. 
If you don't care enough about your father to tell me what I need to know, I'll get it out of you this way. 
You're not going to do this! 
Please! 
No! 
You're not going to do this! 
Stop it! Stop it! 
O'Brian. 
What's your time frame on the reposition? 
Suspect's going to be headed back out on the road any minute. 
My request's still in the queue. 
Chloe, we've got to get that satellite coverage up and running now. 
There's nothing I can do. 
You're going to have to find a way to keep him from getting back on the road. 
It's going to take as long as it takes. Just hurry. 
Okay, I will. 
Why is Debbie here? 
What did you do? 
I called her and asked her to come over. 
You said that you would help me. 
That you talked to Father. 
Your father's right. 
We need to find out who she told about this morning. 
I told you she didn't see anything! 
Then there shouldn't be any problem. 
What did you say to her? 
I told her that I was concerned about the two of you and that I wanted to help. 
Mom... 
Behrooz, you know what's at stake. 
You do as you're told, understand? 
Debbie, thank you for coming. 
Sure. 
Hi. 
Come in. 
Debbie, please. 
Make yourself comfortable in the living room. 
I'll make tea. 
Hi. 
Hey. 
I'm glad your mom called. 
If she and your dad have problems with us being together, we should talk about it. 
Debbie... 
What's wrong? 
You don't understand. 
You shouldn't have come here. 
Why do you always say things like that? 
Damn it. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, what's your bottom line? 
Am I going to have satellite coverage in the next minute or two? 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
It's going to take at least another five. 
That's too long. That's 
the best I can do. 
Damn it. I'm going to have to figure 
out a way to keep this guy here. 
Keep working on it. 
Okay, I will. 
Everybody put your hands up now! 
You, Don't move! 
Caption By Dean From F6 Rearranged By allanmauwx From TLF In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity. 
If he is proven guilty, he will be executed in accordance with our laws. 
When the trial begins, you may have an opportunity to escape. 
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous. 
When Dad told me to take the briefcase to Omar, Debbie followed me. 
Debbie saw the warehouse where we're holding Heller? 
Yes. But father found out 
she was with me, and now he wants me to get her over here. 
You know what that means. 
Debbie, thank you for coming. 
Sure. 
I need you to build a fire wall around Station Four. 
Who's that? 
Her name's Maryanne. 
I just want to make sure she doesn't stray outside the area of her assignment. Fine. 
Listen to me. The terrorists 
have just announced that they are going to try and execute Heller in less than four hours. 
Bring the man in now. 
I don't think that's the right call. 
I believe that if I follow them, they're going to lead me to Secretary Heller and the men who kidnapped him. 
Jack Bauer is no longer cooperating with this investigation. 
All departments need to be working on the location and capture of Jack Bauer and the hostile that he's tracking now. 
Right now, our first priority is to find these terrorists. 
I'm going to need satellite surveillance to help me track them without being seen. 
You want me to steal satellite bandwidth from CTU without anyone knowing? 
Yes. 
Am I going to have satellite coverage in the next minute or two? 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
It's going to take at least another five. 
I'm going to have to figure out a way to keep this guy here. 
Keep working on it. 
Everybody put your hands up now You- don't move! 
Slowly, move back to the corner. 
Everybody just stay calm. 
You'll be out of here before you know it. 
You... 
hop up on the counter, black out that camera. 
Anybody else working in the back? 
Put your hands up. 
Move over there with the others. 
Now! 
You have any IDs on the other two? 
I don't know yet. 
If I did, I'd tell you. 
I'll keep you updated. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, please do. 
Briefing in five minutes. 
County just reported that Andrew Paige was taken into their ER in critical condition. 
Paige? The programmer Jack 
went to pick up? 
That's not all. 
The bodies of two unidentified Middle Eastern men were found at the site gunshot wounds. 
Bauer must have done that to save the kid. 
Where did they find all this? 
Moore Park. 
It's getting out of control. 
We lose an agent, now one of our only witnesses has been disabled. 
What about the hostile and Bauer? 
Still at large. 
All right. 
We have less than three hours before Heller is executed in front of the country. 
Maybe we shouldn't concentrate everything on Bauer, and pursue other leads. 
Except for Heller's son, we have no other leads. 
I want all tactical teams working on finding Bauer and the hostile. 
You got it. 
Keep moving back towards the corner. 
Move! 
Everybody get down on the ground. 
Lady, get down on the floor! 
Take it easy. 
Shut up! 
You want to get through this, lady, you listen to me. 
You understand? 
Get down on the floor now! 
I want your wallets and your cell phones. 
Make it quick. 
Where's your cell phone? 
I don't have one. 
Where's your cell phone? 
What's this? 
You some kind of cop? 
No. 
What do you need this for? 
Protection. 
I get my money, no one gets hurt. 
Do I make myself clear? 
You, in the cap. 
What's your name? 
Doug. 
Doug, give me your keys. 
Which one of these opens the front door? 
Which one!? 
The brass one. 
Hi. I'm sorry. We've 
got an electrical problem with the store. 
We're closed right now. 
I just need a pack of cigarettes. 
I'm sorry. You're going 
to have to go to the gas station across the street. 
Thank you. 
O'Brian. 
The satellite up yet? 
No. I have to reposition 
without Driscoll noticing. 
Where are you? 
I'm at a Mercury Mart in Solmas. 
I had to stage a robbery to keep the hostile in place. What? 
It was the only way I could stop him from getting back on the road. 
How much longer? 
It's going to take ten minutes. 
Son of a bitch. 
Chloe, please hurry. 
I'll get back to you. 
Chloe? 
Driscoll's called a briefing. 
I'll be there in a couple minutes. 
Chloe, now. 
Where you going? 
To a briefing. 
Should I be in there? 
No. 
Hi. I'm Maryanne. 
I'm helping out today. 
Okay. 
And you are? 
This is Chloe O'Brian, our senior sys tech. 
She doesn't have time to chat either, Maryanne. 
It's nice to meet you, Chloe. 
As some of you know, about an hour ago, a hostile abducted a witness in this case Andrew Paige. 
Do we have any idea where this hostile is now? 
No, but we have general direction of travel. 
County Emergency Services just called this in. 
His best route of escape is the freeway. 
He'll likely dump his vehicle and try to hijack another one. 
This is Andrew Paige. 
He was apparently tortured and about to be killed when, it seems, Jack Bauer intervened. 
Assuming this took place in the last half hour, and that the hostile was continuing east, he's somewhere in the northeastern corridor of Ventura County. 
We'll coordinate with Caltrans, CHP and Ventura Sheriff to set up watch points. 
I want every available resource on this. Edgar, 
take the lead in satellite positioning. 
Sara, you'll coordinate with NSA. 
That's all, thank you. 
Chloe? 
I'm sorry about Andrew. 
I know he was a friend of yours. 
They said there's a good chance that he'll pull through. 
Thanks. 
And, Chloe, there's nothing you could have done. 
I want you to put a pipeline on Chloe's system. 
What for? 
She knew about Andrew Paige. 
How do you know that? 
Her reactions. 
Which means she's been in touch with Jack Bauer. 
Well, I'll need her access code. 
Doug! 
Get over here now! 
Open the safe. 
That's it? 
Yeah. 
Why don't you take it and leave? 
I won't say anything to the. 
When does your armored truck make its pickup? 
About 12:30. 
What, you want to rob the armored truck, too? 
Shut up. 
Get back in the corner. 
Move! 
Is he going to keep us here another two hours? 
We have to do something to stop him. 
Damn it. 
Something is wrong. 
Kaleel is not answering his phone. 
Maybe he's out of range. 
No. Not for this long. 
Check with our people in the area. 
Find out if anything has happened to him. 
Kaleel may not be here in time. 
We'll have to start booting up the routers without him. 
Take care of it. 
Let my daughter go. 
You don't need her. 
She has already been useful. 
Please. 
I'll do whatever you want. 
I know you will. 
That's why we are keeping her. 
I don't care if you kill me. 
But if you kill her, even your own people will see you as a barbaric pig. 
Is this what your religion teaches you? 
Dad. Dad. 
Calm down. 
You all right? 
I'm fine. 
Where's your medication? 
Your nitroglycerin. 
Where is it? 
I left it in the car. 
My father has a heart condition. 
He needs his medication. 
Any indication Chloe's been in contact with Bauer? 
No. 
Keep watching. 
This is Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, it's Chloe. 
Why are you calling me? 
I need to talk to you in private. 
Meet me in Archives. 
When? 
Now. 
Why are we meeting like this? 
I'm busy. 
Edgar, I need you to help me. 
Help you with what? 
Sara piped in to my system. 
Why would she do that? 
Driscoll must have asked her to, otherwise she wouldn't even have access. 
Well, if Driscoll's spying on ya, I'm sure she's got a good reason. 
I'm not getting involved. 
I've been in contact with Jack Bauer. 
What?! 
That's right, now you're involved. 
So you're either going to help me or you're going to turn me in. 
I'm turning you in. 
Jack can find Heller if he's allowed to follow the hostile, but Driscoll won't let him. 
That's her call. 
She's wrong. 
That's your opinion. 
These decisions are not ours to make. 
How about if you do it as a favor to me? 
How many times have I helped you since you started here? 
A lot. 
What about the first two weeks when I had to do all your work for you because you were too nervous? 
You owe me. 
You're asking me to do something that can get me fired. 
Not if I say I ordered you to do it. 
Remember, I outrank you. 
I'd take the heat. 
What do I have to do? 
I need to reposition the satellite for Jack, and I need to do it now. 
Since Sarah's piping my system, we have to use yours. 
Okay. 
Send it to Archives Three. 
Transfer my calls there. 
I want to know who's in charge here. 
I want to speak to the man who was just in here. 
You'll speak to him later. 
No, now! 
I am the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America. 
You will listen to me! 
Dad, don't make it worse. 
What do you mean, worse?! 
What could be worse than waiting around here to be murdered by a bunch of lawless, Godless thugs? 
Dad, calm down. 
I don't want to calm down! 
Don't tell me to calm down! 
What's the point? 
We're here, okay? The best thing 
we could do is keep our heads, and hope that someone comes along... 
Hope? 
Hope that we get rescued? 
We have to do something! 
We have to take... 
Dad, what is it? 
What's happening? 
Okay, try to take a deep breath. 
I need help. 
Look, help me, please. 
I... I think he's 
having a heart attack. 
Dad, look, you've got to lie down. 
Lie down. 
You've got to... 
Dad, are you listening to me? 
It's okay, he's coming. 
Step back. 
Hurry. 
Move away from him. 
You need to lie him down, please! 
Hurry. Look... 
Step away. 
Go on, get out of here! 
Still with me? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Go back, go back. 
Put your weapon down, slowly. 
Both of you, hands on your head. 
If another one of my men dies, your daughter will be killed. 
When the armored truck pulls up, how many men come inside? 
Two. One stays by the door 
and one picks up the money. 
They park in the front or the back? 
In the front, by the street. 
Come on, let's go. 
Everybody up! 
We're moving to the back of the store! Now! 
Stand over there. 
Look, the longer you keep us here... 
Shut up! 
Let's go! 
You try that again and I will kill you. 
You understand me? 
Get up. 
Now! 
Move to the back of the store. 
Damn it. 
Everybody in the freezer now! 
Not you. 
Move. 
Anybody makes a sound, I kill all of you. 
Doug, you in there? 
Make him go away. 
Sorry, I didn't hear you. 
I was in the back room. 
How come you're closed? 
I'm taking inventory. 
In the middle of the day? 
Yeah. 
Okay, um... 
Sure everything's all right? 
Yeah, fine. 
You don't look fine, Doug. 
I'm just a little tired. 
Thanks, Bill. 
You mind if I use the head? 
It's... broken. 
Something's wrong here. 
Now you going to tell me what it is, or do I have to come in and see for myself? 
Don't even think about it. 
Step inside now. 
Move. 
Grab that counter. 
Doug, lock the door. 
JACK: Give me the keys. 
I want you to go over there, give me his gun and his radio. 
Move, come on! 
Take out his cuffs. 
Officer, put your hands behind your back. 
Cuff him. 
Go back to the freezer. 
Let's go. 
At this time, we have no more information regarding the kidnapping of Secretary of Defense James Heller and his daughter Audrey other than the image you are now seeing, which was... 
My husband and I realize we've been unfair to you. 
We've treated you as badly as we have been treated ourselves, by certain ignorant people. 
Well, it was pretty obvious you didn't approve of us going out. 
Is that okay to say? 
Yeah, it's okay. 
Well, we hope you'll accept our apology. 
That means a lot to me. 
That said, there's something else I want to discuss with you. 
What's that? 
This morning, you followed Behrooz to his father's warehouse. 
Oh. 
Um... I thought Behrooz 
was seeing someone else. 
I got jealous. 
Oh, I understand. 
But Mr. Araz moved 
his inventory there because he's been robbed a few times. 
And we've been trying to keep that place secret so it doesn't happen again. 
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is. 
Good. 
And you haven't told anyone yet? 
No. 
I haven't talked to anyone but Behrooz today. 
Well, then that's settled. 
Thank you for inviting me here, Mrs. Araz. 
It's my pleasure. 
Has Behrooz ever shown you pictures from when he was a child? 
No. 
Show her, Behrooz. 
Have a look at these. 
I'll be right back. 
Oh, my God. 
That's not you. 
It is. 
You were so cute. 
Thank you, Hannah. 
You're welcome. 
Have you been following this, Mr. Araz? 
Yes, it's horrible. 
It makes it so difficult for the rest of us when people from home do these unspeakable things. 
I agree. 
Yes. 
The girl didn't tell anyone. 
Are you sure? 
Yes. 
Good. It'll be taken 
care of, then? 
Soon. 
Have Behrooz do it. 
He created this problem. 
He should be responsible for solving it himself. 
I agree. 
I'll call you when it's done. 
Thank you. 
2-Charles-Nine. 
This is Station Four. 
There's a 2-11 in progress at 2221 Mill Road, cross street Cedar. 
Two males seen leaving bank with shotguns. 
Respond Code Three. 
Two-Charles-Nine. 
Do you copy? 
Stand back from the door! 
Step back! 
Two-Charles-Nine. 
Do you copy? 
You... 
Are you Unit Nine? 
Yeah. 
You tell them you're on your way. 
One wrong word and I will kill you. 
Now. 
Two-Charles-Nine... 
Help! We're being robbed! 
Two-Charles-Nine. 
We have help on the way. 
Get up, now. 
Now's your time to let us go before the cops get here. 
Shut up. 
These people are your responsibility. 
You'd better start talking to them. 
Sara, has Chloe had any contact with Bauer yet? 
No. 
What about the work she's doing? 
Could it be on his behalf? 
No. I've been watching 
her system. 
Chloe is not stupid. 
Assume she's taking measures to protect herself. 
Maybe she's co-opted the help of someone else inside. 
I'm not quite sure how much of my time you want me to devote to this, Miss Driscoll. 
I expect you to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, Sara. 
Chloe's loyal to Bauer. 
There's a good chance that she's helping him. 
Find out how. 
What are you doing? 
That looks like a satellite screen. 
It was. 
I mean, it is. 
A satellite for what? 
We're trying to find Bauer, remember? 
Division's already doing that. 
I'm just going over what they're doing. 
Sometimes they miss data. 
Do they know that you're doing that? 
Yeah, they know what I'm doing. 
Here, call them if you don't believe me. 
Relax, Edgar. 
I don't have to call anybody. 
Do what you have to do. 
I will. 
Do me a favor? 
There's a chance that Jack might try to contact Chloe. 
If you see or hear anything, call me, okay? 
Why would Jack try to contact Chloe? 
He just might. 
Let me know. 
Sure. 
Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, what did she want? 
She wants to nail you to the wall and take a piece out of me, too. 
Remember our deal. 
If you get caught, you don't take me with you. 
And if I get caught, you say you ordered me to do this. 
You don't have to repeat the deal. 
I'm the one who came up with it. 
Did you reposition the satellite yet? 
I'm working on it. 
Leave me alone. 
No, let them stay in the field. 
We'll use our own people for that. 
Hang on, Ed. 
Yes, what is it? 
Miss Driscoll, your daughter's on line two. 
I'm busy. 
Tell her I'll call her back. 
She says it's important. 
Fine. 
Ed, I'm going to have to get back to you. 
All right. 
Okay, bye. 
Maya? 
I need you to come home. 
What's wrong? 
I'm having a bad day. 
Sweetheart, have you been taking your medication? 
No. 
If you don't take it, you're going to feel bad. 
Now, you know that. 
It numbs me. 
I don't like it. 
Do you like feeling like this better? 
Come home. 
I can't, Maya. 
Why not? 
Listen to me. 
I want you to take the pills and I'll call you back as soon as I can, all right? 
You promise? 
Of course, I promise. 
What are you going to do? 
I'll take my pills. 
Good. 
Do you love me? 
You know I do. 
Then why don't you say it? 
I love you, Maya. Okay? 
Okay. 
All right, bye. 
Behrooz, can I see you for a moment? 
Yes. 
I'll be right back. 
Okay. 
I talked to your father. 
We both agree you have to be the one who'll take care of this. 
But she didn't tell anyone. 
And we're fortunate that's the case. 
But she still saw the warehouse and she could tell the authorities about it, if she's ever brought in for questioning. 
This is riskier than letting her live. 
If she disappears, her mother will call the. 
By the time this day is over, the will be too busy to look for a runaway girl. 
Now take it. 
Don't make me bring your father into this. 
Just take her to the basement and do it. 
Don't think about it. 
Get it over Behrooz. 
Hey. 
Everything okay? 
Yeah. 
I want to make a copy of this one. 
Can I take it home and scan it? 
Sure. 
We need to get out of here. 
What? 
You're in danger. 
Are you kidding? 
From who? 
Don't ask questions, just come with me. 
What? Behrooz... 
Trust me, Debbie. 
Trust me, Debbie. 
We're okay. Come on. 
I can't. 
Why not? 
What's wrong? 
I don't know. 
Debbie? 
Debbie, what's wrong? 
Answer me, Debbie, what's wrong? 
Come on, Debbie, what's wrong? 
Get up, Debbie, we need to go, Come on. 
Please help me! 
Come on, Deb! 
What's wrong, Debbie? 
Come on, Debbie! 
Come on. 
Debbie, what's wrong? 
What did you do to her? 
I didn't expect you to be able to do it. 
Debbie? 
Debbie? 
Come on, Debbie! 
Debbie! 
Give me the gun. 
Give me the gun. 
Hey! 
I am so disappointed in you. 
Yeah. 
This is Sergeant Dennis McGrath. 
You know you're surrounded. 
You should know that I've got hostages and I will kill them, if you try to use tear gas and send your men in. 
Let's not go there yet, okay? 
Who do you have in there? 
The owner, two men and a woman. 
What about Officer Datson? 
Yeah, I've got him, too. 
You only need one hostage to protect yourself. 
Keep Officer Datson and let the others go. 
I need to think about that. 
Yeah? 
I've got satellite coverage. 
Okay, good. 
The suspect will be free in about five minutes. 
He'll be traveling on foot on Route 11. 
I'll find him. 
One of you is coming with me. 
You. 
Come here. 
Put your hands up against the rack. Now! 
Everybody else, to the back of the cooler. 
Move! 
Open the door. 
Lock the door with the chain. 
Now, I will let you go as soon as we are clear. 
But if you try and be a hero again, I will kill you. 
Do you understand me? 
I understand. 
Good. 
Let's go. 
Which car is yours? 
The blue Lexus. 
Unlock the door. 
Move. 
Tell those officers to put their weapons down and take five steps back! 
Okay, calm down. 
We're going to try and help you through this. 
Tell them to do it now! 
Okay, drop your weapons and move back! 
JACK: Stand back! 
Do what he says. Step back. 
Step back. 
Come on. Come on. 
Open the door. 
Come on, open the driver's door. 
You try and follow me, I will shoot him! 
On my count, get in. 
One, two, three, move. 
Go! Go! 
Call in a roadblock. 
Suspect driving east on Route 11. 
One hostage. 
Move the rearview mirror to the right so I can see out the back. 
There. 
When do you let me go? 
When I feel like it. 
Who are you? 
What do you mean? 
You don't seem like the kind of guy that needs to rob a Mercury Mart. 
That Mercury Mart was a money drop. 
There was supposed to be 18 grand in that safe. 
How do you know that? 
We're done sharing. 
I'm not gonna forget your face, and I've got your driver's license. 
You talk to the, it's not gonna be hard to find you, do you understand me? 
I won't tell them a thing. 
Okay, pull over here. 
Now! 
Get out of the car. 
Move! 
Start running. 
Now! 
O'Brian. 
You got him? 
Yeah. 
Good work. Now download 
his position on my PDA. 
And stay reachable. 
I will. 
I'm sorry, could you repeat that? 
Hold on a second. 
Miss Driscoll? 
Yes, Sara, what is it? 
You have a phone call from a man who says he's your neighbor a George Cliocove? 
He says it's about your daughter. 
What line? 
Six. 
George, it's Erin. 
Erin, there's been another incident with Maya. 
What's happened? 
She came into the backyard where Evan was playing, and she started screaming at him again. 
Is Evan okay? 
Yes. Fortunately, 
I was home. 
But this is the end, Erin. 
I've got to protect my boy. 
Did you call the, George? 
Yes, I did. 
They're on their way. 
Where's Maya now? 
She went back to your house. 
I'm very sorry, George. 
This will not happen again. 
It can't, Erin. 
Miss Driscoll, is everything all right? 
No, it's not. 
Is there anything I can do to help? 
Yes. 
I need you to call LAPD Westside and find out who they dispatched to pick up my daughter. 
She has a medical condition. 
She suffers from schizophrenia. 
There was an incident with one of my neighbors. 
What would you like me to do once I find out who they dispatched? 
Tell the officers to cancel the call. 
I'll take care of it personally. 
Yeah, I don't think that's possible. 
Once a call's in progress, don't they have to follow through? 
CTU has preemptive privilege over local. 
Yes, but that's only in a national security situation. 
Sara, I'm asking you to do something. 
Should I ask someone else? 
No. 
I'll do it. 
Send a unit over to my house. 
One medic, one field agent. 
Bring Maya back to our clinic. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, I got it. 
Thanks. 
I found Jack Bauer. 
Where is he? 
In Solmas. He's still 
tracking the hostile, only now he's using satellite. 
How do you know that? 
DOD just called to complain that someone over here was stealing bandwidth. 
I took a look at the imagery and found him. 
All right, bring them both in. 
Who logged on to that satellite? 
Chloe. 
Chloe, why are you logged on to an active DOD satellite? 
All right, you're done here. 
Whatever, I was gonna quit anyway. 
You're not being fired. 
You're being arrested. 
Call security. 
Edgar, lock up her systems and take control of all her files. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I want you to call Jack Bauer now. 
Yeah. 
Driscoll wants to talk to you. 
What are you talking about? 
Hello, Jack. 
Erin... look, I've got 
some information for you. 
The hostile's name is Kaleel Hassein. 
Stand down, Jack. It's over. 
Erin, right now Hassein is free. 
He's looking for a car and a phone. 
Once he has those things, he's gonna lead us straight to Secretary Heller, I promise. 
You can't know that for sure. 
What have you got to lose? 
You've got him on satellite. 
Just bombard the area with a receptor beacon. 
Send a team to pick up the hostile. 
Damn it, Erin, if you do that, everything I've done over the last two hours will mean nothing! 
I'm glad you finally figured that out. 
Erin! 
Take Ms. O'Brian into holding. 
ERIN: Edgar... you 
have it up on satellite? 
EDGAR: Yeah. 
The hostile's flagging down a car. 
You need some help? 
Yeah. 
I just, uh... 
Give me the feed down here. 
Sara, what's the load on the cell tower in that area? 
About 40 to 50 calls. 
Put personnel on every call. 
Record every call. 
Let's see if he contacts someone. 
Yes? 
Omar, it's me. 
Where have you been? 
We've been worried. 
Everything's fine. 
I'll explain later. 
Where are you? 
I'll be there within the hour. 
Is the broadcast on schedule? 
Yes. 
We're about to prepare Heller. 
Hurry. 
Edgar. 
Not now. 
Yes, now. 
How do you feel about what's happening to Chloe? 
What do you mean? 
She's not just gonna lose her job, she might go to prison. 
What do you care about all this? 
I overheard the conversation you had earlier. 
I know you were working with her behind Driscoll's back. 
What do you want? 
I want to make sure I have your attention whenever I need it. 
Thanks, Robin. 
Miss Driscoll, we got the call. 
ERIN: Put it on speaker. 
Cue it from the top of the call. 
Omar, it's me. 
Where have you been? 
We've been worried. 
Everything's fine. 
I'll explain later. 
Where are you? 
I'll be there within the hour. 
Is the broadcast on schedule? Yes. 
We're about to prepare Heller. 
Hurry. 
Looks like Jack was right. 
Tell the teams to stand down for the time being. 
Keep tracking Hassein by satellite. 
Son of a bitch. 
Damn it! 
Get out of the car! 
Put your hands in the air! 
OFFICER: Step behind the vehicle now! 
Come on! Come on! 
Get out of the car! 
Get your hands up Now! 
and step out of the vehicle! 
Suspect is armed... 
Step away from the car! 
Take two steps forward! 
On your knees! 
Put your palms down! 
Put your chest flat on the ground! 
Keep your hands down! 
All the way down!

Bauer is heading the field operation. 
Jack Bauer is not the only man who can do the job! 
Put someone else in charge! 
Jack, we've got a problem. 
Secret service is on their way over there now to arrest you. 
Bill, they can't interrupt this mission. 
You got to stall 'em. 
There's nothing I can do from here. 
You have to get Marean before secret service gets there. 
People of america, you wake up today to a different world. 
I have a visual on Marean. 
He is in the building. 
Damn it. They know we're here. 
Everybody move on the doors. 
Our cover's blown! 
Everyone go, go, go, go, go! 
President Logan realized this was a mistake. 
You're free to go. 
We had Marean. 
Damn it! We had him! 
This man Marean has a nuclear warhead, and I allowed him to escape. 
Mr. President... 
Stop! 
I don't even know if I deserve to be called that. 
There's someone who can advise you better than I can. 
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do. 
President Logan is requesting you run the effort to recover the stolen weapon and be in place to make whatever decisions need to be made. 
Is it compatible? 
I'll need to reconfigure the trigger mechanism. 
Has the warhead been reconfigured? 
Yes, we, uh... may have a 
potential security breach here. 
Who? 
The technician, sabir. 
His girlfriend's getting suspicious. 
I think sabir may have become involved with radical groups. 
You mean terrorists? 
Yes. 
The woman with the phone tip who was suspicious about her boyfriend panned out. 
She sent us a schematic of a microchip that was used exclusively in the legacy nuclear warhead. 
Take a team with you. 
Let's get on this. 
what was that? 
he's going to ram us! 
The following takes place between 2:00 A.M. and 3:00 A.M. 
It's good to have you back, Mr. President. 
Thank you, aaron. 
This way, sir. 
President Logan's not working out of the west wing? 
No, sir. 
Since the strike on air force one, he's been in the bunker. 
How's your son? 
Very well, sir. 
Thank you for asking. 
Still in the service? 
Yes. In fact, he, uh, 
just re-upped. 
Good for him. 
We're mighty proud. 
Mr. President, thank you for coming. 
Mike. Is there an update on 
president Keeler's condition? 
No, he's still comatose. 
And the long  term prognosis is still unclear? 
Yes. 
How's president Logan? 
Looking forward to seeing you. 
Thank you, aaron. 
President Logan. 
David. 
I appreciate you coming so quickly. 
Tell me how I can help you. 
David... I wasn't prepared to have 
all of this thrust upon me so suddenly. 
What I'm trying to say is I-I made mistakes. 
This crisis could've ended an hour ago if I hadn't interfered with a CTU operation that would've... 
would've captured Habib Marean. 
Punishing yourself for a mistake is something you can't afford right now. 
What I can't afford and what this country can't afford is another mistake. 
Every decision I make affects the lives of millions of americans. 
I understand the pressure you're under. 
I know you do. 
When you were in office, you dealt with this kind of situation more than once. 
That's why i want you here. 
I still don't understand what it is I can do to help you. 
Sit. 
The warhead that was stolen is an s-series. 
That's one of the most powerful nuclear weapons in the arsenal. 
Wherever it's detonated, it will wreak... unthinkable devastation. 
Help me find it. 
I will give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary. 
Charles, how do you want this to work? 
I'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU, and I'll let him know that... 
he'll be dealing directly with you. 
All right. 
Thank you, david. 
Mike'll fill you in. 
We will get through this, Mr. President. 
Um, I'll be, uh, in conference room b working on the morning statement for the press. 
I'll keep you apprised of any developments, sir. 
Thank you, mike. 
Mr. President... 
I know you believe my actions during your term in office amounted to a personal and political betrayal... 
it's not something I believe. 
It's a fact. 
Get to your point. 
If my presence here makes it more difficult for you, say the word, and I'll leave. 
Mike... you're wired 
into this administration, and I have no doubt that you have this country's best interests at heart, so for now, let's let bygones be bygones and get to work. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I appreciate that. 
I reviewed the briefing materials on the way here. 
Have army reserve supplement the search teams looking for the warhead in iowa and have D.O.E. And D.O.D. Coordinating 
on crisis response in case it's detonated. 
Yes, sir. 
CTU is heading up the search for this man who stole the warhead, Habib Marean? 
Yes. They recovered a damaged videotape 
from Marean's last known location. 
They're in the process of restoring it. 
But Marean is not CTU's only lead on the warhead now. 
What else do we have? 
A CTU analyst named Chloe o'brian secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marean's associates. 
This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead. 
I told you I'm not hurt. 
I did the shooting. Now please 
leave me alone so I can do this. 
Okay. The hard drive is unlocked. 
Chloe, the hard drive belonged to someone who had no previous experience with nuclear weapons. 
He had to get that information from someone. 
The emails I'm decrypting look like exactly that: Weapons schematics, designs of nuclear triggers- all from the same person. 
Who? 
The e-mail address itself is shielded under a false domain name. 
What is it? 
Mem4xp. 
Okay. Chloe, I want you to 
forward all the emails to us. 
Edgar? 
I'll run a trace to find the point of origin. 
These emails came from a domestic server. 
Whoever sent this is in this country. 
Okay, Chloe, thank you. 
Hold on. 
Hey. How you holding up? 
I'm not used to the idea that I just killed someone, if that's what you're asking, but I'm doing my job. 
Fair enough. 
Get back as soon as you can, okay? 
Okay. 
I got a hit. 
The man who sent the emails name is lee jong. 
Is he in our database? 
He's a chinese national: A research scientist who worked on china's nuclear weapon's program. 
He was accused of falsifying research data and fired by their government in 2001. 
Is it possible china's providing Marean with support for this attack? 
No, the chinese wouldn't use someone that could be traced back to them so easily. 
He's selling his services as a freelance operator. 
If lee's helping Marean reconfigure or redeploy the warhead, most likely he'll know how to find it. 
Check with the I.N.S., 
See if lee's entered the country in the last week. 
Excuse me. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, dr. Besson. 
You wanted me to give you an update on Paul Raines. 
He's still in recovery, but you can see him now. 
Just limit your visit to a few minutes. 
Thank you, doctor. 
Get back to me if you find anything. 
Where can I find you? 
I'll be in medical. 
Okay. 
Yeah, I understand. 
Hey. 
Dr. Besson wants to move you to 
amherst general's spinal program, but the faa still has a ban on air travel. 
I am trying to get you an exemption. 
Well, if anyone can get an exemption... you can. 
Listen... I've thought a lot about this, 
and... I want to go with 
you to massachusetts. 
"With me"? 
Yeah. 
You need to get better, and you shouldn't have to do that alone. 
No, I can take care of myself. 
I don't need your charity. 
It's not about charity, Paul. 
It's what I want to do. 
What about Jack? 
You said you were in love with him. 
I know. 
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. 
I'll come back later. 
No, it's all right. 
Come in. 
Thought you'd be at the dod briefing. 
Yeah, it ended early. 
Oh. I just wanted to come 
down and see how you're doing. 
I've been trying to get down here since you got out of surgery. 
Listen, Paul... 
please, you don't have to say anything. 
Yeah, I do. 
You saved my life. 
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, so... you pushed me out of the way. 
Honestly, I wasn't even thinking. It just happened... 
Paul? You all right? 
I'll check back on you later. 
Does he know that you want to come with me? 
Not yet. 
What is it? 
We found lee jong. 
Where is he? 
Chinese consulate. 
Damn it, he must have known we were coming for him. 
He took refuge. 
He got there about an hour ago. 
Consulate's sovereign territory. 
It's the one place we can't get to him. 
But we're going to try. 
David palmer for you. 
David palmer? 
Frankly, president Logan's been a little overwhelmed by what's been happening. 
He enlisted palmer to help us directly. 
Good. 
This is Bauer. 
Hold for the president. 
Sir. 
Thank you, mike. 
It's nice to talk to you again, Jack. 
It's nice to talk to you, too, Mr. President. 
L assume Bill told you about lee jong. 
Yes, sir. 
I'm about to call the chinese consul and explain the situation. 
I'd like it if you personally took lee into custody and brought him back to CTU for interrogation. 
And you think the consul will be cooperative? 
He's a reasonable man. 
And what if the political approach doesn't work? 
I'll leave it to you to make the necessary preparations. 
Whatever it takes, we need this man lee in custody. 
I understand, Mr. President. 
Thank you, Jack. 
You have a chinese interpreter? 
Melissa rabb. She's very good. 
Okay, I need her, curtis and one of his agents,ready to move on the consulate now. 
Edgar stiles. 
Okay, I'm opening a window now, send it through. 
Ms. Dessler. 
Division just called. 
That videotape they were trying to restore they were only able to reconstruct part of it. 
They're sending it to my work station as we speak. 
Bill. 
People of america, you wake up today to a different world. 
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you. 
It'll be days and weeks before you can measure the damage we have caused. 
But as you count your dead, remember... 
you wake up today to a different world. 
Do we take that literally? 
That he'll set off the warhead before dawn? 
We have to look at the worse case scenario. 
What time is sunrise on the east coast? 
7:02. Less than two hours from now. 
Unless you renounce your policies of imperialism and interventionist activities this attack will be followed by another and another after that. 
The chinese consul in los angeles, a man named koo yin. 
Mr. Koo, this is david palmer. 
It's an honor to speak with you, Mr. President. 
I'm calling on behalf of president Logan. 
The situation today has forced him to direct his attention to other,equally urgent matters. 
I understand. 
And my government extends its sympathy for these terrible attacks on your country. 
We stand ready to help in any way we can. 
Thank you. 
The fact is, you can help us. 
There's a man in your consulate by the name of lee jong. 
Yes, he arrived here earlier tonight. 
We have evidence connecting him to the terrorists behind today's attacks. 
We need to take Mr. Lee into 
custody immediately for questioning. 
Mr. Lee expected suspicion to fall on him. 
He says there's been a mistake, he has no connections with terrorists. 
We believe he's helping the terrorists detonate a nuclear device on our soil. 
Many lives are at stake, Mr. Koo. 
President palmer I would very much like to help, but Mr. Lee is a chinese citizen and 
the consulate is chinese territory. 
I can't just hand him over to you without going through channels. 
Then I urge you to contact the premier immediately and explain the situation. 
Tell him speed is of the essence. 
Tell him cooperation will be regarded as an extraordinary act of friendship on the part of his nation, and our nation will respond in kind. 
Mr. President, I'll do my best. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
Thank you, Mr. Koo. 
Consul's going to try to make something happen. 
How long will it take? 
I don't know. 
Anything new? 
Yeah, white house just authorized adding iowa army reserve units to the ground search. 
Have they widened the perimeter? 
Yeah, they locked down a 60-mile radius around the area where the warhead was stolen, but I'm concerned Marean's people might have managed to sneak it outside that perimeter. 
Well, we closed all major roads and air traffic immediately, but there is a chance they got it through. 
Homeland security's faxing over casualty projections based on that possibility. 
That's probably them right now. 
Yeah, I'll get it. 
CTU. 
Woman: I'm calling for Tony Almeida. 
Who is this? 
This is Michelle Dessler, a colleague of his. 
May I ask who's calling? 
The woman he happens to be living with. Is he there? 
Yeah, hold on. 
It's for you. 
Who is it? 
The woman you're living with Jen. 
I've been calling everyone we know going crazy looking for you. 
Then finally I thought maybe Jack Bauer took you back there. 
Do you have any idea how worried I've been? 
Yeah, I'm sorry, I should have called earlier, but I've been very busy. 
Oh, really? Busy with Michelle Dessler? 
I'm working, jen. 
Oh, for CTU. 
On a provisional basis, yeah. 
I thought you hated that place. 
Things have changed a little. 
Yeah, I guess they have. 
Look, jen, we can talk about this later. 
Right now I got to go, all right? 
Tony, what's your ex-wife doing there? 
Jen, I'm sorry, but I got to go. 
Michelle, um... 
I'm sorry you had to find out like that. 
It's really none of my business. 
Yeah, it is. 
I should have told you I was living with somebody else. 
I don't want to talk about this right now. 
Yeah, well, I do. Listen to me. 
When you left, everything fell apart and jen happened to be there for me. 
You don't have to make excuses for your relationship. 
I'm not making excuses. 
I'm just telling you how it is. 
Do you love her? 
No. 
Ms. Dessler, the new protocols 
from dod just came in. 
Should I send them to your screen? 
Send them to station 16. 
Thank you, Edgar. 
You okay? 
I'm fine. 
Is there anything I can do? 
I said I'm fine. 
I'm trying not to think about what happened. 
I'm going to process it later, okay? 
Sure, fine. 
Edgar, I appreciate your concern, I really do. 
It's just that when I shot that guy, I thought I'd go all fetal position, but the truth is I didn't feel anything. 
At all. I hope I'm not 
some kind of a psychopath. 
Well, he was trying to kill you. 
Yeah, but still. 
Maybe it's a delayed reaction kind of thing. 
Maybe you'll freak out about it in a few days. 
I hope so. 
Sir. 
Sir. Bill Buchanan. 
thank you. 
Yes, Bill? 
Mr. President, we've just seen 
a tape recorded by Habib Marean. 
On it, he says we'll be, quote "waking up to a different world. " 
We can't be sure what that means, but it may indicate that the warhead will be detonated before dawn on the east coast. 
Thank you, Bill. 
CTU thinks that the warhead may be detonated before dawn. 
Get me Mr. Koo. 
This is koo yin. 
Please hold for president palmer, sir. 
Mr. Koo. 
President palmer, I didn't expect to hear from you quite so soon. 
Has the premier been made aware of the situation? 
Yes, Mr. President, he's 
considering it very carefully. 
There's no time for that. 
I've just learned that the terrorists may detonate a nuclear device within the next two hours. 
Mr. Palmer, I understand 
the urgency of the situation. 
And without making any promises, I have every expectation of giving you a favorable answer. 
When? 
I know I'll be speaking with him again in two to three hours. 
I told you, that's not soon enough. 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
It's the best I can do. 
Thank you, Mr. Koo, for your efforts. 
Please keep me informed. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
he thinks Mr. Lee will be handed over 
to us, but not before two or three hours. 
Now, from their point of view, that's moving very fast for something like this. 
From ours- not nearly fast enough. 
what do we do? 
this is Bauer. 
Jack, are you at the consulate yet? 
Yes, sir, we've taken up position across the street. 
Have they agreed to release lee? 
Not quickly enough. 
And I just learned that the nuclear device may be set off at any moment. 
Now, Jack, is there any doubt in your mind that lee is working with Marean? 
No, sir- the e-mails he sent left no room for doubt. 
Then we have to get lee out now and find out what he knows. 
Yes, sir. 
No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this ever. If you're caught, you'll be tried 
in a chinese court under chinese law. 
I understand. 
Now, Jack, if it was anyone else, I'd ask if you were sure about this. 
With you, I already know the answer. 
God bless you. 
Good luck. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
We're on. We're going in to get him. 
All right. 
Almeida. 
Tony, this is Jack. 
I'm at the consulate. 
I need you to get me real-time infrared satellite coverage. 
All right, I'm on it. 
What's going on, Jack? 
The consul's not going to release lee in time. 
We have to go in and get him. 
Who knows about this? 
We have authorization from the white house. 
Tony, this is a covert operation. 
You're the only person at CTU who can know. 
I need you to spoof the satellite logs and make sure that the mainframes aren't monitoring your station. 
Tony, there can't be any record that this ever took place, you understand? 
Yeah. 
Okay, thanks. 
Let's suit up. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
I'm on com. 
All right, Jack, I'm uploading a picture of lee to you right now. 
Also, I just got a hold of the building schematic. 
Can you overlay the infrared? 
Coming now. 
Looks like the bulk of the people are on the first floor residential area, most of them not moving, probably asleep. 
Try the second floor offices. 
Grabbing data on the second floor. 
All right, we got people moving. 
Okay, by the way they're gathering around that third room, that's probably where lee is. 
I think you're right. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I'm moving. 
How do you want to deploy? 
I want agent rabb to stay in the van until I need her to translate. 
You both can cover the perimeter. 
I'm going in alone. 
Jack... 
my orders are to make this mission completely deniable. 
If I get caught, I have to be able to say I was acting alone. 
All right, what do you want us to do? 
Stay here. 
If I need you, you both can reengage as soon as I leave the consulate, but only on a covert basis- masks on, non-lethal force, you understand? 
We'll be here. 
Tony, I'm going in. Any change on infrared? 
Negative. 
We'll continue monitoring in real time. 
Alarm's a cambia model three. 
I'm jumping the relays at the door now. 
Roger that. 
All right, Jack, stop. 
We have somebody approaching from your west side. 
I repeat, your west side. 
Okay, he's moving away. 
Give me the status on the other four guards. 
Jack, you're right on top of them. 
We have someone approaching from your north side. 
Okay, you're clear. 
I've got him. 
Roger that. 
People moving toward you on both floors. 
I'm heading out. Hostiles 
in pursuit. Bring up the van. 
Go! Go! Go! Go! 
let's go! 
He's hit. 
Pass me the medical bag. 
Now! 
We're in. 
Go! Go! 
Jack, give me a status. 
We're away, lee's in custody. 
He's been shot in the back, no exit wound. 
How bad is it? 
I can't tell yet. 
The bleeding doesn't look too severe. 
We're on our way to you. 
We're about 15 minutes out. 
I'll have medical ready. 
he says not to touch him. 
He doesn't want you to touch him. 
Tell him I'm just trying to help him. 
I need to check his wound. 
hold him down! 
Hold him down now! 
We need to calm him down so that I can talk to him. 
Tell him we got medical assistance waiting for him and that this shot is only to help him ease the pain. 
Does he understand? 
Yes Mm-hmm. 
That's great. 
Thank you very much. 
Hey, the faa's cleared us to leave at 8:00 on a medical transport plane. 
Dr. Besson's agreed to accompany us. 
That's great news. 
As soon as you settle in, I'll start looking for an apartment. 
I don't know what to say. 
I'm going to get through this. 
I know you will. 
Raines. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
All right, so you're going to take care of the transportation... 
I got to call you back Paul? 
Paul, what is it? 
Paul? 
Dr. Besson! 
Please, someone come quickly! 
Okay, okay, it's okay. 
He's right here. 
10 milligrams vasopressin. 
What's going on? 
I can barely hear his heart. 
We need to do an ultrasound, but all signs point to a cardiac tamponade. 
What does that mean? 
The sac around his heart is filling up with blood. 
Drain off some of the fluid, but we got to get him back in surgery now. 
If we don't stop the bleeding, his heart will not be able to function. 
Get me the pericardiocentesis tray, now. 
Okay... 
...roll on his back. 
there. 
Tell him we know that he helped Habib Marean with the missing warhead, and now we need him to help us find Marean and stop him before he can detonate it. 
If he denies involvement, tell him we can prove it with his e-mails. 
he doesn't deny it. 
He says he knows where Marean is, and he will tell you if you agree to his terms. 
What are they? 
he says he went to the consulate seeking protection from our government as well as Marean. 
He believes Marean wants to kill him to prevent him from talking. 
He wants our guarantee of protection. 
Tell him if the information that he provides us leads us to the warhead in time, he will be immune from prosecution in this country and I will take him back to the chinese consulate or wherever he wants to go. 
he says this is acceptable, but he wants a guarantee of this in writing from the president. 
Tell him I understand that and I will get that for him. 
I give him my word, but I need the information now. 
He says he must have this guarantee before he will tell you. 
No, that's not good enough. 
this is bau... this is Bauer. 
President palmer's on the line. 
Put him through. 
Jack, Buchanan told me you've got lee jong in custody, and that he was wounded. 
Yes, sir. 
Is he talking? 
He wants to help us, but he won't till he has a written guarantee that he won't be prosecuted in this country. 
We also have to provide safe travel to a destination of his choosing. 
This guarantee has to be signed by the president. 
Jack, CTU believes the detonation of this warhead is imminent. 
Can you force him to talk immediately? 
I don't think so. 
I think the fastest way to make this happen- give him what he wants. 
Okay. I'll get the guarantee from Logan 
and have it waiting for you at CTU. 
Thank you, sir. 
What is it? 
Su ming, the deputy chinese consul. 
They didn't waste any time. 
I can't blame them. 
They have to know we're behind the attack. 
What shall I tell him? 
I'll take the call. 
We have to start fencing with them sooner or later. 
Might as well be now. 
Mr. Lee won't talk unless he has a 
guarantee of immunity and safe transport. 
Get that from Logan, will you? 
Mr. Su. Yes. 
�� Is this president palmer? 
Yes. Has the premier 
responded to the consul's request to have Mr. Lee turned over to us? 
Mr. President... the consul is dead. 
What? 
He was shot when armed men broke into this building and took Mr. 
Lee with them by force. 
I'm shocked and deeply saddened. Please convey 
that to your government on behalf of mine. 
Mr. President... is it your position that 
you have no knowledge of this operation? 
That the timing of your call and this abduction is entirely coincidental? 
The consulate is a sovereign territory of the people's republic of china. 
I can't believe anyone connected with this country had a hand in it. 
I'm sure you understand the political ramifications if you are incorrect. 
And I'm sure you understand the ramifications of unproven accusations. 
No accusations have been made, Mr. President, but 
I can assure you there will be an investigation. 
Your government will have my complete cooperation. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I'm sure you'll be hearing from us again... very soon. 
President Logan will provide lee with a written guarantee, as long as it remains covert. 
Sir? What's wrong? 
Koo yin was killed in the course of the abduction. 
my god. 
By one of our own people? 
No. It must have been friendly 
fire, but it really doesn't matter. 
If they're able to find proof that we were involved, in the long run, the repercussions will be as serious as those we're facing from the terrorists. 
Tony. 
I just heard that lee jong is on his way here and he's been shot. 
How did this happen? 
The chinese weren't going to give lee up in time, so Jack and his team had to extract him. 
Jack went into the consulate? On whose authority? 
The white house. 
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this? 
This operation needed to be kept off the books to make it was deniable. 
But you knew about it. 
Yes, I did. I ran tactical from here. 
It is absolutely unacceptable. I 
was kept out of the loop on this. 
That's the way Jack wanted to play it. 
You don't work for Jack! You work for me! 
A situation, frankly, I wish I had been consulted on in the first place. 
Meaning? 
Meaning, I thought it was a mistake to reinstate you, and now I'm certain of it. 
Look, I understand you don't appreciate being kept in the dark... 
but I think this is about something else. 
Well, you're wrong about that, too, and you are way out of line! 
Thank you. 
Tell him we're almost there. 
The medical assistance that we promised him and the guarantee are waiting for him. 
I can't understand him. 
Ask him if he's in pain. 
He says he's cold, very cold. 
What's going on, Jack? 
He must have severe internal bleeding. 
Damn it. His lungs are 
filling up with fluid. 
I'll alert CTU. 
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. 
Tell me where Habib Marean is. 
Please, tell me where he is now. 
Damn it, we're losing him. 
All right, stand by with a gurney. 
We're coming in hot. 
Jack Jack, what's going on? 
Jack You can't come in here. 
He's dying. 
So is he. Get out of here. 
I just started this operation. 
This man is our only connection to a stolen nuclear warhead. 
You've got to save him now. 
I'll get to him as soon as I can. 
He's not gonna make it. 
I already have a patient. 
Curtis. 
You have a new one. 
Are you crazy? 
Maybe you didn't understand me. 
This is the only man that can help us find the missing warhead and stop it from being detonated. 
If you don't save him, millions of people will die. 
Do you understand that? Millions of people. 
Start working on him now! 
Jack, what are you doing? 
If I walk away from Mr. 
Raines now, he will die. 
You don't know that for sure. 
Jack Do it. Now! 
Give him more volume. 
Jack,please,please don't do this. 
His lungs are damaged. 
He's lost a lot of blood. 
All I need you to do is stabilize him so I can talk to him. Can you do that? 
Maybe. 
Then do it. 
Deborah, I need you over here. 
What about Mr. Raines? 
Have one of the agents give chest compressions if the pressure drops. 
I got it. 
Put some gloves on. 
Jack Jack I have my orders! I'm doing my job! 
I'm sorry. 
You're sorry?! You're letting him die! 
Get her away now! 
Stop it, Jack! 
Jack, stop!He saved your life! 
There's a tension pneumo. We have 
to relieve the pressure immediately. 
Get me a chest tube! 
Get him on a monitor. 
Jack, please, stop this. 
Pulse is weakening. Pressure dropping. 
I'm begging you,Jack,stop it! 
Hey, let go of me! 
Please! 
Let go of me! 
Jack, Paul's crashing. 
What can we do for him? 
He's in v-fib. Use the defibrillator! 
Charging. 
Clear! 
Hit him again, Jack! 
Charging! 
Clear! 
He's still flatlining. 
Give him a shot of epinephrine. 
Where is it? 
On the tray, second syringe from the left. 
Got it. 
Inject it in the iv. 
It's in. 
Come on... 
Jack. 
Jack. He's dead. 
no! 
Jack! 
No! 
He's gone. 
oh, my god. 
You son of a bitch, Jack! 
You son of a bitch! You killed him! 
He saved your life! 
Get her out of here- now. 
You killed him! I hate you, Jack! 
You killed him! How could you do this?! 
You killed him, Jack. 
You killed him! 
Let go of me! 
Suture. 
Is he gonna make it? 
I'm doing the best I can. 
The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors. 
I'm going to have to manage the override personally, make sure those six meltdown on schedule. 
Is there anything I can do? 
Take care of your mess. 
I give you my word, my wife and son will be dead by the end of this day. 
I'm not afraid of Father. 
You should be. 
He tried to kill me and then he did this to you. 
You're going to need to set things up on your end. 
All right, what do I do? 
Divert suspicion. 
Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside. 
Ms. Driscoll, what's going on? 
You're under arrest, Gavin. 
For what? 
Passing classified information. 
Thousands of people's lives are at stake. 
Where are the people who control the override? 
I swear, I don't know anything. 
Yeah? 
DRISCOLL: We've got a match, Jack. 
His name is Henry Powell. 
He's a computer consultant, that used to work for McLennen-Forster. 
They're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants. 
You're going to fly me out of here. 
Drop the weapon now! 
Now! 
Put him in the back. 
( gunshot ) He's dead, Jack. 
Damn it! 
You've got the wrong person. 
Sarah's not guilty of anything. 
It's Maryanne Taylor. 
( alarm blaring ) ( groans ) You're under arrest. 
( car alarms blaring ) Excuse me, Curtis. 
Not now. 
Coordinate that with NRC and copy me on 6-0-B. Bye. 
I warned you about her. 
What are you talking about? 
Maryanne Taylor. 
I told you she was trouble and it was a mistake to let her work here. No. 
You told me that you weren't comfortable working with her. 
You didn't tell me you were having a relationship with a corporate spy. 
How could I have possibly known that, Erin? 
Don't play that card with me. 
Fine, then don't walk in here with an I-told-you-so attitude. 
Because now we both have to deal with this. 
You mean division? 
That's right. 
They're going to want a complete timeline. 
Everything from how Maryanne got through the front door, down to the high-security files that she was able to access in a very short period of time. 
Can we have a conversation off book? 
Go ahead. 
There's no point in either of us compromising our authority in the eyes of division. 
Agree or disagree? 
Agreed. 
Maryanne did an excellent job in establishing her credentials. 
All we need to do is leave out some of the details in how she managed to leverage her way in here. 
I don't like anyone holding something over me. 
Neither do I. 
How long will it take you to adjust the files? 
Two minutes. 
I'll call division at 5:00. 
Explain to me how this mole Maryanne Taylor was able to infiltrate CTU. 
We're still investigating, Mr. President. 
Who does she work for? 
We don't know. 
Find out. 
We will, as soon as she regains consciousness. 
She's being treated here in the clinic. 
Treated for what? 
An attempt on her life. 
Who tried to kill her? 
We don't know that either. 
But whoever it was, they're more than likely connected with the theft of the override. 
Jim, we need to find that override now. 
What's the latest from the NRC? 
They just reported the San Gabriel Island reactor is about to go critical. 
What's the timeframe? 
A meltdown within the hour. 
We started evacuating the San Gabriel zone. 
The population affected is less than 100,000. 
Hopefully most of them are already on the move. 
All right. 
Expedite the process as much as you can. 
Yes, sir. 
( phone ringing ) DRISCOLL: Jack? 
Erin, Powell's dead. 
He was hit by a sniper as soon as we took him into custody. 
Get anything from him before he was killed? 
No, but I managed to get the last ten calls he made off his cell phone. 
He called two numbers repeatedly. 
Through caller ID, we traced one of them to Maryanne Taylor. 
Powell was working with Maryanne? 
Apparently. 
What about this other number? 
Hold on. 
I'm going to need you to trace it through CTU. 
Okay, go ahead. 
818-555-0539. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I've got an ID. 
I'll be standing by. 
Edgar, I need you to run a locate on this number. 
( keyboard keys clattering ) It's a cellular account. 
Can you trace the location? 
I need to ping the number. 
How? 
It needs to ring at least four times before I can triangulate the coordinates. 
Jameson can have me set up in a couple of minutes. 
WOMAN: Who is it? 
Navi. 
Navi? 
What are you doing here? 
I'm looking for Dina. 
Well, Dina's not here. 
Why would she be? 
She hasn't called you in the last hour? 
No. What's 
going on, Navi? 
Why are you blocking the door? 
I'm not. 
Let me in. 
I told you, she's not here. 
You're lying. 
You're hiding her. 
No, I'm not. Navi, no. 
You have no right to come in here like this! 
She is not here. 
Go. Look. 
That is my bedroom. 
You can't go in there. 
What the hell is going on here? 
Nothing, it's okay. 
Navi, please. 
Please, go. 
Look, pal, this is none of your business, all right? 
So why don't you hike it on out of here? Please, don't interfere. 
You can either walk out of here or I'm going to throw you out. 
I said, go! 
( gun cocking ) No, Navi, please, no. 
Navi, don't, please. 
Get back inside. 
Navi. 
Don't tell my husband. 
I beg of you. 
You disgust me. 
Navi. 
( door slams ) Dina's not here. 
What about the hospitals? 
MAN: Nothing so far. 
Keep looking. 
( phone rings ) Is it your father? 
I can't tell. 
Don't answer it. 
( phone continues ringing ) We got it. 
Where? 
A hotel in Chatsworth. 
Download the coordinates to Jack's PDA. 
Here's our backup. 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
DRISCOLL: We traced the call to a fixed location. 
We're sending it to you now. 
Hold on a second. 
Okay, I got it. 
We're less than ten minutes out. 
I'll have a tactical team in place by the time you get there. 
Thank you. 
The body is over there by my car. 
He was taken out by a sniper from the north roof. 
I want you to take your photographs and get the body back to CTU as fast as possible. 
Come on, Tony, we've got to go. 
Wait, Jack. 
Look, uh, I think I'm done here today. 
What are you talking about? 
CTU backup's here. 
You don't need me anymore. 
I need you to see this through with me. 
I appreciate the sentiment, Jack, but you don't have to prop up my ego. 
Tony, this isn't about you. 
If we don't find the override device within an hour, we're going to have six major nuclear disasters. 
So please, get in the car. Let's go. 
Mom, we've got to get you some help. 
I'm okay. 
I'm sorry. 
This is my fault. 
Your father shot me, not you. 
Because you were trying to stop him from killing me. 
Everything that's happening today, what we've all been fighting to achieve, it's more important to him than anything or anyone. 
But not to you. 
M om? 
I need to get you something for the pain. 
I'll be fine. 
I just need to rest. 
I can get it from Nasim. 
No. 
The hospital he works at is right near here. 
I'll be right back. 
Nasim doesn't know why we were really living here. 
Mom, he's your brother. 
I'll tell him you need it and nothing else. 
I promise. 
I'll be right back. 
Just hurry. 
I will. 
Mr. Secretary, 
we have a meltdown. 
The San Gabriel Island reactor has just gone critical. 
The core material is now airborne. 
I thought we had more time. 
Ms. Driscoll, I have Derrick 
Ross with the engineer at San Gabriel Island on with the NRC. 
One of their generators exploded, it cooked their com lines, so the feed is unstable. 
We may only have a few seconds. 
Patch us in. 
What's going on? 
We've had a meltdown on San Gabriel Island. 
( garbled transmission ) All attempts to contain the core have failed. 
Right now my men are trying to bypass the reactor trip, but that's not working either. 
Mr. Rosner, 
this is Erin Driscoll from CTU. 
Can you hear me? 
Yes, ma'am, I can. 
I'm here with Secretary of Defense James Heller. 
What are your radiation levels? 
We're at 500 rem right now. 
That's 10,000 times the dose of an X ray. 
At this rem rate, the radiation will continue getting stronger and will spill into the atmosphere until the core has exhausted itself. 
Son, you've done everything you can, now get the hell out of there. 
Evacuating won't make any difference, sir. 
We've already been exposed. 
We lost them. 
Have we analyzed the radiation cloud's movement? 
We're still waiting for NGS to get a weather satellite for us. 
Get on the phone and have them expedite it. 
I will, as soon as I'm done rerouting these evacuation instructions. 
Can't someone else do that? 
No, sir, I'm short of manpower. 
A government spokesman has just confirmed that the nuclear reactor at San Gabriel Island is in full meltdown. 
Emergency personnel are on site attempting to rescue workers exposed to radiation. 
Several people have been taken... 
You're not listening to me. 
I've been trying to get through to a number in the San Gabriel evacuation zone for ten minutes. 
I need you to link me in to access the emergency bandwidth, and I need you to do it now. 
All right, standby. 
Thank you. 
If you are on the road or awaiting instructions... 
( phone rings ) ...here are some items 
you and your family might need. 
WOMAN: Hello? 
EDGAR: Mom. 
Oh, hello, Edgar. 
Have you seen the news? 
Yes, I'm watching it now. 
Then why haven't you evacuated by now? 
What are you still doing home? 
You know I don't have a car. 
Where's Margaret? 
Well, I've tried to get hold of her, but the lines are all busy. 
I'm surprised you got through. 
What about one of your neighbors? 
Can't you get a ride from one of them? 
No. By the time I got outside 
they were all gone. 
Mom, listen to me. 
I'm going to make some calls. 
I'm going to get someone there to help you, okay? 
I want you to sit by the phone and wait for my call. 
Can you do that? 
Yes, I don't really have a choice. 
I'll call you back, okay? 
Okay, honey. Bye. 
No, we delegated that whole situation to Murphy's group, sir. 
HELLER: I'm not interested in who got it wrong. 
We don't have the luxury of miscommunications. 
I'm assigning someone from my office to coordinate between the State Police and the National Guard. 
Set up the conference call in ten minutes. 
Thank you all. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. How are you 
holding up? 
Considering the situation we're in... 
I'm doing fine. 
The truth of the matter is, we do not have the manpower to handle this mess. 
Tell me what I can do. 
I've prioritized evacuation protocol, but I need someone to keep the State Police and the National Guard from bumping in to each other. 
All right. 
I'll stop the Guard at the 75th mile marker and let the police take over from there. 
That'll maximize room for civilian traffic. 
I wish we had some other way to get those people out of there. 
There's nowhere else to route them. 
Jack has got to find the override before the rest of these reactors go critical. 
Hey, Jack. 
Good to have you in the field again. 
Thanks, Lee. 
You remember Tony Almeida? 
Yeah. 
I don't know what he's doing here, though. 
I want him here. 
LEE: He's not authorized to be in the field. 
I'm going through that door first. 
I want him there to back me up. 
Fine. 
Get another vest. 
You got a visual on the suspect? 
We've got a fiber optic camera inside the room. 
According to the manager, we're grabbing a mid-40s female and a teenage male. 
Possibly mother and son, both Middle-Eastern. 
Okay, we need the suspects alive. 
They're no good to us dead. 
I've been briefed. 
Let's go. 
Agent Castle, we've got a visual on the woman. 
What about the kid? 
I haven't seen him yet. 
We got to go, now. 
You ready? 
Go. 
Don't move! 
Drop the weapon! 
( gunshot ) Where is the override? 
Tell me who's got it! 
Tell me! 
( screams ) Now! 
Agent Castle! 
Agent Castle, stand down! 
Agent Castle, please stand down! 
Get off her! 
We've got to get her to talk. 
She's going to go into shock before she does. 
Just relax! 
Agent Castle, step outside now! 
I want her prints and photographs. 
Send them over to CTU immediately. 
He has no right to give me orders. 
Hey, come here. 
He did the right thing. 
That woman was willing to kill herself. 
She'd die before she gave us anything through force. 
We need to get her to talk before the other reactors go critical. 
And we will. 
What did you have in mind? 
We need to find some leverage. 
( phone rings ) CTU, Barnes. 
Yeah, it's Jack. 
Put me through to Erin. 
Come here. Come here. 
Let me see your arm. 
Driscoll. 
Erin, we've got a suspect. 
I'm sending you fingerprints and photographs. 
I need you to run a profile and send me all relevant databases and electronic communications. 
Got it. 
Thank you. 
Hey, I understand your concerns about Almeida, but for me, please, just give him a break. 
Okay, Jack. 
TONY: Jack! 
Thanks. 
JACK: Yeah? 
This is a bullet wound. 
Probably a couple hours old. 
As the evacuation appears now to be in full swing with major delays on all routes... 
Excuse me. 
A nuclear emergency team has just emerged from the plant. 
Uh, we can see them here on our Sky-Cam. 
They seem to be going through some kind of decontamination... 
( new report continues in background ) Behrooz. 
Uncle Nasim. 
Are you all right? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Yeah, it's a disaster what's happening today. 
Everyone's panicked about radiation poisoning. 
They all want iodine pills and we're almost out. 
Is that why you're here? 
No. 
I need pain medication. 
It's for my mother. 
She couldn't reach her doctor by phone, so she wanted me to get it from you. 
What's wrong with her? 
It's her back. 
She can barely walk. 
She needs a prescription. 
I told you. 
She couldn't reach her doctor. 
I'll see what I can do, okay? 
Just have a seat. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
Navi, it's Nasim. 
Hello, Nasim, how are you? 
I'm well, but Behrooz just showed up at the hospital. 
He seems disturbed. 
Is Dina there too? 
No, he says he needs pain medication for her. 
That there's something wrong with her back, but he's acting very strange. 
I'm sorry you have to be involved in this, Nasim. 
Involved in what? 
What's going on? 
Behrooz may be taking drugs. 
He's been getting worse. 
I'm sorry. 
Me, too. 
What do you want me to do? 
Keep Behrooz there until I can come for him. 
How long will you be? 
15 minutes. 
I'll do my best, but... 
Please, Nasim, don't let him leave until I get there. 
...congestion, the government 
is asking people to remain calm and exit in a quick and safe manner. 
Excuse me, Miss Raines. 
I'm Edgar Stiles. 
Sorry. 
We've got a major noncompliance problem. 
I've got 25% of the evacuees who aren't going where they're being told to go, and another 25% that don't even know that they're in the evac zone. 
However you need to do it, make sure it gets done. 
I'm sorry, what is it? 
It's my mother. 
Your mother? 
She lives near San Gabriel Island. 
She's in a wheelchair. 
She doesn't drive. 
She missed her call to evacuate. 
Now I don't know what to do. 
Maybe someone from the National Guard can get her. 
I already spoke to the area commander. 
He said he couldn't spare anyone. 
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can do. 
Here's his number. 
I thought maybe if you called him yourself. 
Look, I hate asking for special treatment. 
That's not something I would normally do, but she's my mother. 
I can't make any promises. 
Just promise me you'll try, okay? 
All right. 
I want you to give her something for the pain, but make sure she stays lucid. 
Understand? 
Did you find out who she is yet? 
Yeah. 
Her name is Dina Araz. 
She immigrated to the United States five years ago, became a citizen two years ago. 
Married to a Navi Araz. 
He's also a naturalized citizen. 
Owns an electronics store in Carson. 
They have one son, Behrooz, 17, a junior at the local high school. 
None of them have criminal records. 
They pop up on any watch lists? 
No, they must have slipped under the radar. 
Let's send some teams over to the house and the store, see what we can find. 
( phone rings ) Yeah? 
Jack, it's Driscoll. 
Homeland Security has... 
Hold on, Erin. 
I can barely hear you. 
Go ahead. 
After the attack this morning, Homeland Security has been archiving select communications in the L.A. area. 
They pulled up a call that may explain how Dina Araz got shot. 
Erin, I'm going to put you on speaker phone. Hold on a second. 
You're on. 
This conversation happened about two hours ago between the mother and the son. 
BEHROOZ: He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie. 
DINA: Behrooz, that's not possible. 
Your father would never want to hurt you. 
BEHROOZ: It's true. 
Tariq told me everything. 
DINA: He was lying. 
BEHROOZ: No, he wasn't. 
Mom, I don't know what to do. 
You have to help me. 
DINA: Where are you now? 
BEHROOZ: I'm near the Metrolink station on Lassen in Chatsworth. 
DINA: Are you using Tariq's car? 
BEHROOZ: Yes. 
DINA: Hide it. 
I'll pick you up there in a half hour. 
BEHROOZ: Hurry. 
That's it. 
Let me know the minute you get something from her. 
Yeah. 
We got our leverage. 
( door opens ) JACK: Lee. 
( water running ) How long have you been planning this operation? 
Two years? 
Five years? 
Ten? 
All this planning for one day. 
You do realize if all the reactors melt down, hundreds of thousands of people will die. 
Every war has casualties. 
These people don't know about your war. 
These people are innocent. 
No one is innocent. 
You really believe that? 
As strongly as you believe in what you believe. 
But I won't waste your time or mine, trying to explain something you can never understand. 
Maybe I understand more than you think. 
I doubt it. 
I know that something happened today to challenge your commitment to your war. 
You weren't willing to let your son become a casualty. 
That's why you were shot. 
Protecting him from his father. 
I understand that. 
I know what it's like to watch your child be threatened and feel helpless to do anything about it. 
Right now Behrooz is out there alone... 
and you and I know he's not gonna last very long. 
His father will find him... 
...and kill him. 
There is another option. 
If you were to help us find the override device... 
we will protect your son. 
So he can spend the rest of his life in prison? 
No, so he can walk away from all of this, immune from prosecution. 
How? 
Mrs. Araz, your son is a minor. 
He's 17 years old. 
I can get him a legal and binding pardon signed by the president of the United States. 
You don't have the authority to do this. 
I can reach the president. 
If you provide us with the information that allows us to find the override device in time I am confident that the president will sign that pardon. 
and this offer expires the second another reactor melts down. 
Do you understand me? 
You don't have a lot of time. 
I would think about this. 
Show me this document. 
And I'll help you find what you want. 
Can we rule out this boy's involvement with the terrorist action? 
No, sir. It's likely he knew 
of his parents' plans. 
He probably helped them. 
Jack, you're asking me to grant clemency to a terrorist. 
Mr. President, I'm sorry, 
but I don't think we have a choice. 
In all of my professional experience, I believe that we have to give in to this woman's demands. 
Have you tried negotiating with her? 
We don't have time. 
In approximately two hours, five nuclear reactors are gonna go critical unless we find the override device. 
She is our only link. 
Well, I'm uncomfortable with this, but I trust your judgment. 
I'll release the letter. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Make sure that document is non-binding. 
Yes, I understand. 
I'll get back to you on the redeployment figures. 
Miss Raines? 
Did you talk to them? 
Yes. 
Edgar, I'm sorry. 
They can't get your mother. 
Why not? They're 
five miles off the highway. 
It wouldn't take that much time. 
They know where she is. 
Then what's the problem? 
Thousands of people are stuck on the Interstate in traffic. 
It's taking the combined efforts of the police and the National Guard to get them moving. 
So who cares about one old woman. 
They've got to throw their resources into saving the maximum number of lives. 
If my mother were rich or a politician, they'd find a way to save her. 
Field Communications Desk. 
This is Edgar Stiles. 
I need another switching station for that number. 
Do you need it again? 
No, I've got it logged. 
Hold the line. 
Thank you. 
Go ahead, please. 
Mom. 
Hello, honey. 
Mom, I've been trying everything. 
I can't get anyone out there to help you. 
I've done everything I could. I did. 
I'm sure you did, honey. 
It's okay. 
It's not okay. 
The fallout's coming toward you. 
It's 15 miles away. 
I know. 
I'm watching it on the news and... 
I know what to do. 
Ma, there's nothing you can do. 
You can't stuff towels under the door. 
That's not what I'm talking about doing, Edgar. 
What do you mean? 
They've been talking about radiation poisoning on the news. 
That's not something I want to go through, especially since there's only one way it can end. 
Honey, I want to end things on my terms as opposed to all that pain and suffering. 
Mom. 
It's the right thing to do. 
It's the only thing you know that. 
No, I don't. 
You have been a wonderful son, Edgar. 
You've been a gift to me and your father. 
It's okay. I'm going 
to a better place, and... 
I'll see you there, but not for a long time. 
You've got a lot ahead of you. Great things. 
Maybe I can get someone to you. 
I'll keep trying. 
You've got a very important job to do there. 
A lot of people are counting on you. 
So... 
I'm going to hang up now, and I want you to know how very, very much I love you. 
Mom. 
Ma? 
Edgar, where are you going? 
Edgar! 
I have to get out of here. 
What are you talking about? 
My mother. She lives next to the 
San Gabriel Island nuclear plant. 
She wasn't able to evacuate in time. 
We still have five other nuclear reactors that are on the verge of melting down. 
I need you at your station. 
I don't care what you need. 
You better start caring. 
You have a choice right now. 
Obey orders or end up in a jail cell. 
You're going to arrest me for trying to save my mother's life? 
Edgar, if what you're saying is true, there's nothing you can do for your mother, but there are thousands of other people whose lives you can save. 
Suppose your mother were here right now. 
What would make her proud? 
What do you think she'd want you to do? 
She'd want me to help. 
Then don't you think you should? 
MAN: We're ready to go. 
We're just setting up the comm line. 
This is a pardon for your son signed by the president. 
This is acceptable. 
Where is he? 
He's at Lindower Memorial Hospital. 
It's not far. 
Set up a perimeter around Lindower Memorial. 
I want you to call him and tell him we're coming to pick him up. 
Give her the phone. 
We have to record the call. 
( phone rings ) Hello? 
It's me. Where are you? 
Waiting for Nasim. 
I don't know why he's taking so long. 
Don't worry about that now. 
Things have changed. 
What do you mean? 
Listen carefully, Behrooz. 
Government agents found me. 
I'm with them now. 
Behrooz, they know everything. 
Behrooz, just a few more minutes, okay? 
But it's all right. 
Everything is going to be all right. 
I made a deal. 
What are you talking about? 
You're going to be okay. 
You won't be arrested or even named in any of this. 
I don't understand. 
I'm going to help them stop your father. 
You are? 
Yes. 
You said that I would be okay. 
But what about you? 
We'll talk about that later. 
Right now, these men are coming to pick you up. 
I want you to go with them. 
Are they making you say this? 
No. 
I don't know who these people are. 
I want to be sure that they're not forcing you to say this. 
I'll come with them. 
You'll know when you see me. 
Okay? 
I'll meet you outside. 
No. Tell him to go 
to the emergency room. 
I want him to stay where it's crowded. 
Did you hear that? 
Yes. 
I'll see you in a few minutes, Behrooz. 
Okay. 
We're transferring the suspect. 
I want to set up a protective cordon right away. 
Copy that. 
Let's go. 
Uncle Nasim. 
I have to go. 
What about the pain medication? 
My mom's getting it from somewhere else, but thanks for trying. 
Behrooz! 
Hey. 
What are you doing? 
I can't let you go. 
Why not? 
I spoke to your father. 
What? 
He told me you need help. 
You don't know what you're talking about. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
I gave your father my word. 
My father is a terrorist. 
He's involved in what's happened today. 
Stop talking, Behrooz. 
I swear, it's true. 
You're talking nonsense. 
No, I'm not! 
He's behind the kidnapping this morning, and the reactors melting down. 
We're all involved my mother and me. 
We've killed people. 
Your father will be furious when he hears this. 
My father is coming here? 
No! 
Behrooz! 
I tried to stop him. 
You broke my heart, Behrooz. 
You broke my heart. 
If you kill me, Mother will tell them everything. 
Tell who? 
The police. 
She's with them. 
I don't believe you. 
It's the truth. 
She wants me to be safe and, if you kill me, she will ruin everything you're doing. 
Liar! 
If you don't believe me, look outside. 
They're coming to pick me up. 
Help! 
Shut up! 
Tony, did you notify Security? 
No. 
Something is wrong. 
Set up a Level Three cordon around the hospital. 
I'm going with you. 
No, you're not! 
What's going on here? 
There's been a shooting. 
Who? One of the pharmacists. 
Who are you? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I work with the Counterterrorist Unit. 
We've been tracking the man who did the shooting. 
Where is he? Someone just 
radioed in from C wing. 
Saw a Middle Eastern man running. He has a hostage. 
A 17-year-old boy? 
I think so. 
What are the possible exits from that wing? 
>From where he was spotted, he's pretty much got to end up in the east parking garage. 
We've got men heading there now. 
You tell your supervisor to tell his men to back off. 
No one makes contact with him. 
Do you understand me? 
All right. 
( phone rings ) Hang on a sec. 
Yeah? 
Tony, it's Jack. 
Navi Araz is here. 
He's already killed his wife's brother. 
What about the boy? 
I don't know. 
We're going to have to lock down all the exits. 
I think he's headed for the parking garage. 
I need you to meet me on the east side of the building with backup. 
Copy that. We're going to 
the east side of the building. 
We need backup teams there right away. 
What happened? 
We're still looking for your son. 
There is more. Tell me. 
Mrs. Araz, we're going 
to find your son, all right? 
I hate you. 
I've always hated you. 
The only reason I never said so was because I was afraid of you. 
But I'm not afraid of you anymore. 
Get in. 
Go to hell. 
Get in! 
Jack, we're in the garage now. 
We've secured the exit. 
I'm almost there. 
Can you get an ID? 
No. Nothing yet. 
Let me see your hands! 
Put your hands where I can see them! Now! 
Careful! 
Drop the gun! 
You'll hit the boy! 
Let the boy go! 
We can work this out. 
I will put my gun down if you give me the boy. 
All I want is the boy. 
Stay back! 
Put the g Tony, stop the car! 
Behrooz! 
Mom! 
Keep her in the car! 
That stairwell leads to the basement. 
He's got nowhere to go but down. 
Set up a link with CTU now! 
Copy that. Call CTU. 
We need backup here. 
Mrs. Araz, calm down, we'll get 
your son, all right? Calm down. 
DRISCOLL: We've uploaded the plans to you from the building department. 
There are only three exits from the hospital's basement. 
We've got all entrances and exits covered. 
He's trapped down there. 
Let's try to open up a negotiation. 
My husband won't negotiate. 
Why is that? 
He doesn't need to. 
He has to assume I have agreed to help you in return for my son's safety. 
Well, he can't stay down there with him forever. 
He won't. In two hours, 
all the reactors will have gone critical. After that, 
it won't matter what I tell you, and he can kill my son. 
I am only helping you to save his life. 
I believe in our cause, and if you can't save my son, I am happy to see the reactors melt down. 
Did you get that? 
We have a problem. If the information on that hard drive is discovered by the Americans, 
it'll jeopardize the next phase of our plan. 
Well, it's not here. 
Keep looking. 
Agent Drake? 
Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon now! 
Jack's on the line. 
Jack, what is it? 
I pulled some data off a hard drive that we found hidden in Anderson's apartment. 
I believe Mitch Anderson's trying to steal a stealth fighter. 
Mr. President, we have reason to believe that a stealth fighter has been stolen by a terrorist. 
 He's in your airspace as we speak. 
 Just how sure are we about this? 
It's a near-certainty, Mr. President. 
This is a stealth aircraft. 
If he finds you, he may be on you before your fighter escort can react. 
Mitch Anderson, we know who you are. 
We know what you're trying to do. 
Captain Anderson? Captain Anderson? Chloe, I think we've been cut off. 
Is there an override channel? 
He's cut off all communication circuits. 
I don't think there's anything we can do. 
Dad. I'm scared. 
Air Force One has been fired on. 
I repeat, Air Force One has been fired on. 
Oh, my God. 
Was Air Force One just hit? 
Was Air Force One just hit?! 
Escort pilots report Air Force One has suffered an indirect hit by an air-to-air missile. Pieces are falling to the ground over the desert. 
The following takes place between 11:00 P.M. and 12:00 A.M. 
This is Air Force One. We are declaring an emergency. Repeat, Air Force One is declaring an emergency. 
Copy, Air Force One. What is your condition? Over. 
Extensive damage to the port side wing and fuse lines. We've lost our pressurization, losing fuel pressure. Low hydraulics. 
Chloe, are those the coordinates? 
Yeah. They're 20 knot of the miles northeast to the city of Indio. 
Edgar. Contact local PD and EMS. Alert them of the situation with Air Force One. 
On it. 
Tony, do we have any CTU support teams in the area? 
The Las Vegas office has two satellites search and rescue teams available. 
I'm gonna dispatch Air Force One's coordinates to all of the search and rescue teams over in LA and Vegas so they can start for the landing site now. 
Edgar, pull up satellite on the National Park. Pinpoint any possible landing scenarios. 
Chloe, what's happening? 
We've lost the signal. They're still moving fast and losing altitude. 
Change the frequency. 
OK, I've got it. 
Reaching 6 knots. 
Going through 7500 and 210 knots. 
Roger, 210 knots. 
Chloe, are you still waiting coordinates? 
Yeah, they're making a turn. 
Roger, I'm close to a stall. Yeah, I'm putting you down now. Don't get redeployed, we are still hard and fast. 
Air Traffic Control, This is CTU. We are sending EMS, Police and rescue teams to the site ASAP. 
Copy that, CTU. 
This is Air Force One, descending through 5500, 169�� Chloe, what's showing on radar? 
Air Force One is down. 
Air Force One? Air Force One, do you read? Air Force One is down. 
I just got a confirm of scattered ground flashes from DOD satellite. 
Edgar, bring that up. 
What's the status of Air Force One? 
It's down. 
What's its crash signature like? 
It was a rough landing, radio's down. We don't know if there are any survivors. 
Match your coordinates to the satellite. Send it to all agencies. 
Got it. 
Anybody tried sub-channel com-sat? 
No. 
Secret Service has at least five personnel on board; all of them have private channels. 
Com-sat 3 operator. 
This is Jack Bauer. Log in password: F-H-Ralfie-4. 
Go ahead. 
I want you to flood all AF1 channels with an acknowledge signal. 
Copy. This is com-sat 3 operator, calling AF1 channels 1 through 5, please acknowledge. AF1 channels 1 through 5, please acknowledge. 
This is channel 3. 
Who's this? 
Peterson. We're down. 
What is the status of the President? 
I don't know. I can't move yet. 
Agent Peterson, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm with CTU. Rescue units are on route. What else can you tell me? 
I see some bodies. I�� I think we have some survivors. 
Mr. Vice President, I just received confirmation. 
Air Force One sustained an indirect hit from an air-to-air missile fired from a stolen stealth fighter. 
Is the President alive? 
We don't know at this time. 
When will we know? 
Hopefully within the next few minutes. 
Charles, we've known each other for 15 years. If I can offer some advice? 
Of course. 
We all hope President Keeler is alive, but even if he is, it's very likely he won't be in any shape to run the country. 
You need to make arrangements to be sworn into office as soon as possible, and the media should provide live coverage. 
The American people need to be reassured that their leadership is intact. 
It's good advice, Mike. I'll take it under consideration, but I don't wanna act prematurely. 
I understand. 
Well, we have to get to the White House. I've arranged for a security briefing with the Pentagon. 
That's great. 
By now, you all know that Air Force One has been shot down. The escort pilots following Air Force One managed to get a visual of the stealth fighter used to commit the act, 
pilot engaged, then shot down the stealth. The status of the President is unclear at this time. Rescue teams are minutes away. We'll know very soon. 
The man responsible for what has transpired today, Habib Marwan, is still out there, and most likely planning further attacks. I want every one of you to rededicate yourselves to finding Marwan. 
I don't want a single lead ignored or a shred of evidence missed. 
Let's get back to work. 
Michelle, let me talk to you. 
I want you to uplink all curtainlies to a station, so you and I can start working on a priority list. 
We might not know exactly where Marwan is, but he has to be within a 15 mile radius�� J ack. 
Jack. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just got off the phone with the Secretary of Defense, and right now there's a higher priority than finding Marwan. 
What is it? 
Recovering the Nuclear Football. 
Didn't it go down with Air Force One? 
Not exactly. The missile inflicted enough damage that the plane left a trail of debris as it went down. 
A lot of things were sucked out, including the Football. There's a transponder embedded in the casing, so we know its exact location. 
Well, good, then the retrieval team should have no problem recovering it. 
The Secretary wants you to head up that team, Jack. 
Why? 
It's his top priority. 
That case contains the codes and locations of out entire nuclear arsenal. 
Nothing is more critical than getting it back, and as quickly as possible. 
Fine. 
I'll organize your team, mobilize the units. 
Thanks. 
What's the location of the Football? 
Forty miles northeast of here, in the middle of the desert. 
Hey. Hey. 
What's wrong? 
What else is happening? 
Paul may have to go back into surgery. Apparently the bullet did more damage than they thought. 
I'm sorry. 
I keep thinking if I had handled things differently, if I had trusted him more, that�� Audrey, you are not responsible for this. 
I, and I alone, made the decision on how to handle Paul. 
If you wanna remain affective, be able to do your job, you have to let it go. 
Jack, that's your gift. 
You're able to block things out. I can't do that. 
Jack, the chopper's waiting. 
I have to change and get ready. 
All right. 
Honey. 
What's wrong? 
I don't know. Something woke me up. It sounded like some kind of an explosion or something. 
Explosion? Nearby? 
I'm not sure. 
It was probably just a bad dream. 
Yeah. 
You're still stressed, aren't you? I want you to try and forget about work, OK? 
Just focus on what we came out here for �C to relax, and to make a baby. 
Look. 
What? 
Watch your step. 
Oh, my God. 
Kelly. 
What is it? 
If the President is unable to fulfill his duties, Vice President Logan will have to assume office, at least on temporary basis. 
Cabinet members will need to be briefed on the circumstances surrounding the crash. 
Yeah, I'll take care of it. 
Not all Cabinet members are equal. State and Defense need more detail than say, Aviculture and Treasury. 
Yeah, I can handle it. 
I just wanna make sure that the transition is smooth. 
I understand, but uh�� I do know what to do. 
All right. 
Tony. 
I've noticed a little hostility on your part. If it's because of me and Michelle�� 
It's none of my business. 
As far as the hostility goes, I can promise you �C it's over with. 
Whatever you say. 
One more thing; I think the world of Michelle, love working with her. 
Outside work, we never got off the ground, she never said why but it didn't take a genius to figure it out �C she cared about you. 
If you ask me, she still does. 
Mr. Buchanan, rescue teams are inside Air Force One. 
We're picking up the live feed now. 
Go ahead. Check to see if he's alive. 
She's dead too. 
Copy that. They said he was in the conference room. 
We got a survivor. 
I'm going in. 
Looks like the President's son. He's dead. 
Where's the President? This may be him. Wait, hold on. This may be him. 
Mr. President? He's still alive. 
I repeat, the President is alive. 
We need medivac teams in here ASAP. Did you read that? We need medivac teams in here. 
I have Agent Buchanan for the Vice President. 
Yes, he's right here. Bill Buchanan. 
Bill. 
Mr. Vice President. I'm in direct contact with the rescue teams at the crash site of Air Force One. President Keeler is alive. 
Thank God! 
Yes, Sir. 
But he's in critical condition. He is unconscious, he's lost a lot of blood, 
there's no chance he's going to be able to lead this country, certainly not for a few days, and probably much longer. 
Mr. Vice President? 
Yes, I'm here. 
This is all confirmed? 
The President is being medivaced to the nearest emergency center as we speak. 
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th amendment, and take control of things as soon as possible. 
I understand. Thank you, Bill. 
President Keeler is alive but he's incapacitated. 
We should, uh�� we should probably contact the Cabinet members. 
Actually, sir, I've already put that in motion. Most of the Cabinet members are standing-by. The others will be very soon. 
You did without my permission? 
I�� You had enough to worry about, sir. I thought it'd be best to be prepared. 
Yes. All right. 
Thank you. 
Shall I begin the process of collecting votes? 
Yes, go ahead. 
I can't get a signal. 
Try up here. 
Got it. 
Kelly. Look at this. 
what is it? 
I'm not sure, but if it's what I think it is�� I read this article once; I think it's got a funny name, umm�� I can't remember but it's got our nuclear codes. It goes everywhere the President goes, and he can launch an attack from it. 
We gotta call somebody. 
Who are you gonna call? 
I'll start with the police, I guess. They'll put us through to the right people. 
The Football transponder's signal's still strong. 
Hello? 
Hey, it's me. 
Look, when I walked away from you at CTU, I felt like you didn't understand what I was trying to say. 
I'm not telling you that you shouldn't care. I care. I care about you. I care about what happened to Paul, I feel completely responsible for it. 
But right now this country is under attack, and I've got a job to do, and I don't have a choice. 
Jack, I understand. What you have to do is very important. 
I just didn't want us to leave things like that. 
I'm glad. Me neither. 
Audrey, hold on a second. I gotta take this call. 
Wait, Jack. Take the call. Stay focused on what you have to do. 
Yeah, I'll talk to you in a little while. 
 OK. 
 Bye. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's Tony. 
I got a guy on the line the police put through. He's in the desert, says he found a case. 
Jack, this guy found the Football. 
OK. Let me speak to him. 
All right. His name's Jason Gerard. We're running a background check as we speak. 
I'm patching him through right now. 
OK. Tony, stay on the other line. 
Mr. Gerard? 
Yeah. Hey, call me Jason. I'm with my wife Kelly. Who's this? 
Jason, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm a Federal Agent with the Department of Defense. 
My colleague Agent Almeida says you found what we refer to as ��the Football��. 
Yeah, it sure looks that way. 
I mean, I don't know very much about this sort of thing. My wife and I are just out here on a camping trip. 
OK, fine. Why don't you just describe to me what you found? 
Sure. It's a black-leather briefcase; it's got a number paneling over by the handle. 
It was in a protective case that had the Presidential seal on it. 
Well, that sounds like it. 
Right now I'm in a helicopter. I'm about 20 minutes away from you. Look, I just want you to hang out there and wait for me. 
I think someone beat you to the punch. I see headlights. 
How far away? 
Uh, it's hard to tell. A few miles? 
OK, just hold on a second, Jason. 
Tony. This kid Jason says he's got headlights headed towards him. Do we have any ground units in his vicinity? 
No. 
How about patrol park rangers, anything? 
No, nobody. 
How can that be? 
We're spread thin, Jack. All state agencies are still assisting with the evacuation. 
Jason, are the headlights headed straight for you? 
Yeah. They're pretty much coming this way. 
Dammit. This situation just got a lot more complicated than we thought. 
What do you mean? 
The Football has a transponder. It's a tracking device that allows anyone to pinpoint its exact location, as long as they've got the right frequency. 
Do you think someone got a hold of the frequency, who's not supposed to have it? 
Right now we're gonna have to make that assumption. 
Well, who do you think it is? 
The terrorists who carried out today's attacks. 
Listen, if I'm right we don't have a lot of time. 
I need you to remove the transponder and take the Football, and get away from there as far as you can. 
Uh�� All right. 
Flashlight. Get your light. 
OK, uh�� Go ahead. 
The transponder's tiny, and it's hidden in the surface of the case. It's designed not to be found. 
Then how am I supposed to find it? 
Do you have a compass and a flashlight? 
Uh, yeah. Get the compass. 
OK, I want you to move the compass over the surface of the case slowly. 
The transponder puts out an electromagnetic field. 
It's not very strong, but it should move the needle. 
Just move the compass over the surface of the case slowly, and watch the needle. 
Here, here, here. Get the beam of the compass. 
I think I got it. I found it. I found it. 
OK, good. Take a knife or a sharp rock, and start scratching the surface hard. 
Hurry. 
 Dammit. 
 Jason, they're coming. 
Come on, Jason, talk to me. 
I'm working on it. 
OK, I think I got it. 
OK, I want you to take the compass, put it over the scraped area and tell me, is the needle moving? 
No, no, it's not. 
OK, you've disabled it. Good work. How far away is the vehicle? 
Not far! 
OK, I need you to take the Football and start moving. I don't care which direction, just start moving now. I'll get back to you. 
We gotta go. We gotta go now. 
Tony, I'm gonna need surveillance of the entire area put up to my screen. 
Why are we stopping? 
We've lost the signal. 
How is that possible? 
I don't know. Maybe it was damaged on impact 
And it just happens to malfunction now that we're getting closer? 
Scan the area for cell phones, active and passive signals. 
Yeah? 
Jason. OK, we found a reserve power station about a half a mile north of you. 
Yeah, that's right. I remember it from the map. 
OK, I want you to go there now. 
It's OK. Yeah. Yeah, we'll get there. 
The station's a large unmanned facility. I want you to break in and find a place to hide. I want you to avoid using your flashlight, and as soon as you hang up, 
I want you to take your cell batteries out. 
The batteries? 
Yeah, to prevent something called passive triangulation. In other words, it'll stop you from being followed. 
What if I need to contact you? 
If you need to contact me, put the batteries back in, but only if you have to. 
Now, I'm gonna give you my direct line. Have you got a pen? 
Yeah. Hold on. 
Go ahead. 
3-1-0-5-9-7-3-7-8-1 OK, yeah, I got it. 
Start moving now. 
OK. 
He said to take the battery out of the cell phone. Come on. 
I had a cell phone signal for a few seconds. It's moving, but it's gone now. 
Did it move enough to yield a vector? 
Wait. Yes, it was headed a few degrees west of north, just before we cut off. 
Check the map. See if there's anything near there. 
There's a reserve power plant. A kilometer away, maybe less. 
Whoever has the Football, that's where they're heading. 
This is it. 
Stay back. 
We're not in any danger, right? 
I mean, how can anyone even know that we're here? 
We're just being safe. 
Not a relaxing weekend in the desert, just like I said�� They're here. I gotta call Jack. 
Come on. 
This is Bauer. 
It's Jason. These terrorists you talked about? They're here. 
How many? 
I just saw two jeeps. 
Where are you? 
Just inside the power plant. When are you going to get here? 
Soon, just stand-by. 
Go, Kelly, go, go. 
Tony, it's Jack. We're out of time. We need the schematics for the power plant now. 
Yeah, it should be on your screen in a few seconds. 
OK, I got it. Thanks. 
Jason, you're still with me? 
Yeah, I'm with you. 
Which side of the building did you enter? 
Uh�� The, the south side. 
This is a large facility. 
I want you to go to the lower level, southeast corner. 
I'll find you there as soon as we land. 
Ok. 
Hey, hey, Agent Bauer? Please hurry. 
We are. 
Find them. 
There's got to be stairs somewhere. 
Here they are, here they are. 
Wait. What if it's a dead end? 
There's a man and a woman. 
Where are they? 
This way. 
They were down here. 
Follow them and flush them out. 
Go around and cut off the exits. 
Go up there, go up there. 
Come on, come on, come on. 
Ok. 
Anything? 
Nothing. 
Helicopter. 
Intercept it. 
Ok. 
Jason. 
Where are you? 
We just landed. We're approaching the building. Where are you? 
We're inside the plant, on the lower level. 
Jack! Jack! 
Jason, you're still there? 
I'm here. They're inside the building. We cannot keep hiding. They are gonna find us. 
I know. You gotta keep moving. I'll get back right back to you. 
Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, it's Jack. I need to speak to Audrey Raines now. 
Ms. Raines, Jack's on line one. 
Jack. 
Audrey, I'm taking fire. The other agent's been killed. 
I need the latch code for the Football now. 
All right. Hang on. 
Take the Football, take the Football! Come on. 
Jack. *76114. 
I got it. 
Hey. 
Jason, I need you to open the case. The combination is *76114. 
Why? Where does that plant us? 
Just do it. *76114. 
He wants us to open the briefcase. *76114. 
OK, it's open. 
OK. Inside should be a phone, a control board and a book with colored pages. It's called the Playbook. 
I want you to remove the Playbook. Give the case with the control board back to your wife. The two items need to stay separated. 
Why? 
Because the control board is useless without the Playbook. 
I need you and your wife to split up. 
He wants us to split up. 
I can hear him. 
I am not leaving my wife. 
You have to. 
Forget it. 
Jason, please listen to me. I know how scared you are 
but if this man gets what he wants, he's gonna kill both of you. 
Right now the only chance you have to survive is to separate, do you understand me? 
It's OK, Jason. He's kept us alive this far. Let's just do what he says. 
Just get here as fast as you can. 
I will. 
I love you. 
I love you. 
Give me the Playbook. 
Here, you take the phone. 
I want you to go to that top wile over there, all right? I'm gonna stay down here. You just find a place to hide, all right? 
Go, go, go, go. Go. Hide, hide. 
I've got him! 
He's clean. 
Where's the control board? 
I�� I don't know what you're talking about. 
Tell me what I want to know. 
I swear, I don't know what you're talking about. Please. 
It doesn't have to be this painful. 
This is Bauer. 
They've got my husband. They're hurting him. 
Where are you? I'm on the lower level. 
We had to leave. We're on the second floor. I don't know where. 
OK, I'm on my way. 
They're gonna kill him. 
Kelly, stay on the phone. Keep talking to me. 
I can't. 
Kelly! 
Please... 
Where is the control board? 
Stop. 
I have what you want. 
Give it to me. 
First, you let my husband go. 
No! 
OK. OK. 
I'll give it to you if you promise not to kill us. 
I won't kill you. I promise. 
It's over there. 
It's behind the pillar. 
It's locked. 
What is the code? 
It's uh�� *76114. 
It's here. 
Let's go. 
Kill them. 
This is Jack Bauer. I need a medic. Second level, north end of the building. 
It's all right. He's gonna be OK. Help is on the way. 
Where is the Football? 
They have it. They went out that door. 
I'm sorry. 
Don't be. You did great. Thank you. 
Air support, two hostiles just left the building. 
I do not have possession of the Football. I repeat, I do not have possession of the Football. 
Air support, the Football is in the lead jeep headed north. Take it out. 
I repeat, take it out. 
Put your hands where I can see them! 
Air support, I cannot see the Football in the vehicle. Shine your spotlight on me 
and follow. 
Air support, I'm in possession of the Football. Go after the other jeep. 
Almeida. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
I'm in possession of the Football. Three hostiles are down, one escaped. 
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan. 
I'm sorry, but I had to make a choice. 
Marwan gave us the Football to buy his freedom? 
Yeah, that doesn't sound right to me either. 
What are you thinking? 
I don't know. 
Let me ask you something; Is anything missing? 
No. All the components are here. 
Hold on one second. 
Tony, I was wrong. 
There are some pages missing. 
All right, look, Jack, the sections are color-coded. What's missing? 
Red Chapter, Section Three. 
Get Audrey. 
All right. We'll call you right back. 
You're worried about him. 
I am. He seems unsure of himself. 
No, Mike, trust me. 
He spent his whole life preparing for this. He's just being cautious, feeling his way along. He'll be fine. 
Yeah? 
Well, the vote was unanimous. The 25th amendment's been officially invoked. 
Tell the press we're ready. Let's get this done. 
Mr. Vice President 
the 25th amendment is in effect Any descending votes? 
None, sir. 
Well, we should proceed with the sworning then. 
Yes, sir. The sworning will only take a minute, and then we'll take a short break and you can address the nation. 
I'm still not entirely certain that a live address makes much sense this time of night. 
After what's happened today, sir, an awful lot of people are wide awake. I'm sure they'd like to hear from you directly. 
Yes, of course. 
We're ready, sir. 
Please. Please. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. 
Yeah? 
Jack, it's Tony. 
Is Audrey there? 
Jack, I'm here. 
Tell me what the contents are of the missing pages. 
Jack, it's the Red Section which contains warhead locations and activation codes. 
But we started canceling all the activation codes as soon as Air Force One went down. 
Yes, but there are thousands of warheads. It's gonna take an hour to clear the slate. 
Jack, in the meantime, if they get a hold of a warhead and a matching activation code, we will not be able to stop them. 
Copy that. I'll get back to you. 
Mr. Novick's office. 
Let me speak to Mike Novick. 
Yes, sir, right away. 
I soundly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, and will, in the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. 
Mr. President, I appreciate it. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you coming at this late hour. 
Novick. 
Mike, it's Jack. We got a problem. 
��to take this oath under tragic circumstances. Words cannot express the sense of sadness�� 
Part of the Football's been compromised. 
Yes, I'll tell him. 
Mr. President. 
I just received a phone call from CTU. 
I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but it appears that part of the Nuclear Football has fallen into the hands of terrorists. 
Transcript: Nina Myers @inside-24.com/forum/ 
24 SO4E23  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: Mars Translator: sHiN3 Supervisor: Requiem Previously On 24 I'm just been told a cruise missle,has just been launched containing the nuclear warhead? 
Yes,sir,that's correct. 
What about Marwan,Jack? 
You think that he will break? 
That won't be easy,sir. 
He's planned and organized everything that's happened today, Now how am I supposed to be able to fight terrorists while I'm provoking a nuclear superpower? 
We marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals and in the process the Chinese consul was killed. 
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war. 
I assume you know this man- Howard Bern. 
One of your field agents. 
A security camera at the Chinese consulate picked up your face. 
That's impossible. 
I was wearing my mask. 
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame. 
It was you. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
You got to go. 
There's a chopper waiting for you. 
It doesn't matter where you take me. 
What I want is already happening. 
Go! 
Notify the perimeter we no longer have Marwan in custody! 
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago. 
This is a sketch of the guy that Richard Heller described. 
He and the girl are our only leads to finding Marwan, One of us is going to get caught to save the other? 
It's gonna be you. 
Tony, wait. 
I can't spend another day without you. 
I'm ready... 
to leave here. 
I'm ready to go with you. 
Be careful. 
Tony, this is Jack. 
Has anybody reported any outside movement? 
No, why? 
The man is dead. 
The girl is no longer in the apartment. 
Tony, do you copy? 
Tony, do you copy?! 
Castle, why is Almeida not on comm? 
All teams, this is Bauer. 
Castle is down. 
Almeida is missing. 
I repeat, Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage. 
The following takes place between 5:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. 
Jack xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx No, we do not have the female hostile in custody. 
She's hiding somewhere here in the apartment complex. 
She killed agent Castle, and I believe she's taken Tony Almeida as a hostage. 
Is there any way she slipped the perimeter? 
No. 
The perimeter's airtight, but there's over 600 apartments in the complex. 
We have to search them room by room. 
Listen, we need more personnel here. 
Jack, we're running low on manpower. 
Damn it, Bill, there's a missile in the air carrying a nuclear warhead. 
This is our best shot of taking it out before it hits its target. 
The White House has us running point with DOD to find to find the missile. 
We're stretched thin. 
Jack, we'll have LAPD send more men, and we'll send Curtis and another tac team to the location. 
Okay, fine. 
We've already initiated a search starting with the buildings nearest the perimeter working our way in, but we need LAPD here now. 
Keep us posted. 
Contact division, see if they can spare more men. 
I'll call the Liaison at LAPD. 
We've almost completed our second satellite pass over the current flight radius of the missile. 
And no sign of it yet? 
No, not so far. 
What do you think our realistic chances are of being able to locate the missile with subsequent passes? 
I don't think they're very good. 
This missile's an s-class. 
It uses elements of stealth technology. 
It was designed to evade detection. 
I'm aware of that, but it will still have a heat signature. 
Yes, but the lower the missile flies to the ground, the harder it is to pick up. 
How much longer until you've completed the second satellite pass? 
Uh, less than 20 minutes. 
All right, get back to me as soon as you have the results. 
All right. 
I don't care. 
We need every available agent there now. 
But they are not clear for field work. 
Well, bump up their security level on a provisional basis if you have to. 
Call me back with the exact number when you have it. 
All right, coordinate that with Edgar Stiles here at comm. 
Thanks, Rick. 
What did LAPD say? 
They're keeping certain units in reserve... 
but they're sending more patrolmen to help Jack, right? 
They're sending nine over there now, and they're going to try to pull another 12 from east valley. 
Nine? 
That's not nearly enough. 
We'll have to reassign our people, send them over there now. 
I'm taking care of that, Michelle. 
When? 
We need people there now. 
This woman has to be captured. 
Michelle. 
Everyone understands what's at stake here. 
We're going to do our best to find this woman, but we have to remain calm, or everything will spiral out of control. 
You're right- I'm not being objective. 
I'll admit it. 
I'm worried about what this woman might do to Tony, but I will not lose sight of the big picture. 
The big picture is that we have to apprehend this hostile alive. 
Nothing else matters. 
What is it, Marwan? 
You're late. 
You were supposed to check in. 
I know. 
There was a hitch. 
Nothing serious. 
Um, I am going to be there. 
What kind of hitch? 
There was a problem in the apartment, and I'm dealing with it. 
I'm leaving in one hour. 
I'm not waiting for you. 
I know, and I'm going to be there. 
Well, we don't have much time. 
They're very close to finding us, and that would be very, very bad for both of us. 
So, tell me, Tony, two years ago, you put Michelle Dessler's life ahead of national security. 
You let a suspect escape, and you committed treason. 
Is she going to do the same for you? 
Mike, it's Audrey Raines. 
Yes, Audrey, what have you got? 
Well, the second satellite pass is complete. 
We were unable to detect the missile with thermal imaging. 
There's just too much radiant heat from ground sources. 
Ms. Raines, this is President Palmer. 
Is there a chance another satellite pass will find the missile? 
Well, the more data we have, Mr. President, the better, 
but a more intensive pass will take two to three hours. 
And we expect the missile to find its target before then. 
Yes, sir, we do. 
All right. 
Make sure FBI's on a real time link with all local emergency channels. 
All right. I'll get that done right now. 
I also want you to compile disaster scenarios for the urban centers within range of the missiles. 
Sir, that's 20 of the largest cities in this country. 
I'm aware of that. 
I want death rates, fallout patterns, emergency response predictions laid out for all of them. 
Yes, sir, I'll take care of that right now. 
Thank you, Ms. Raines. 
As additional teams arrive on site, assign them sections of the grid. 
We do not want people bumping into each other. 
If the subject is spotted, what's the approach protocol? 
We maximize for capture. 
There can be no lag time. 
Don't you want to evaluate the formation since she's got Tony hostage? 
We proceed as if there is no hostage. 
There is only one operational objective, and that is to capture this woman. 
Make sure that's the profile you send out to all the teams. 
Understand? 
Yes. 
Dessler. 
Why don't you get somewhere private where we can talk? 
Who is this? 
I'm sending you the answer. 
Tony! 
Now do you know who this is? 
And don't bother trying to triangulate the call. 
It's scrambled. 
Please... 
don't hurt him. 
He's okay for now, but he won't be unless you do everything that I say, Michelle. 
I understand. 
I need your help getting out of here. 
Wh-what kind of help? 
You're hesitating. 
I'm not, I'm not. 
I just need to know what you want me to do. 
Your men are between me and my exit. 
I need to know what their search patterns are and how many men there are. 
Okay, okay, I'll find out. 
You'll tell me right now. 
I have to go downstairs and talk to my tactical team. 
Oh, Michelle, you're stalling. 
How many men are there total? 
Upwards of 30, not including LAPD, and reinforcements are on the way. 
You will need you to remove your men from the northeast driveway of the complex I-I-I don't know if I can do that. 
You will redeploy your men by the time I call you back, or Tony dies. 
When are you calling back? 
Soon. 
Get moving, Michelle. 
Well, she still loves you. 
The question is how much. 
Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, send the deployment group to my screen. 
It's updating. 
Want the last version, or do you want to wait? 
Just send it! 
Are LAPD reinforcements there yet? 
They're outside now. 
Some will be there in 15 minutes. 
You want me to send the updated grid when it comes in? 
Ms. Dessler? 
Yes. 
Yes, do that. 
No, no, we can't eliminate the midwest, or any region within the missile's flying range. 
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you. 
This warhead could hit anywhere. 
We're still putting together the projected casualty numbers. 
We just know they're gonna be high. 
Yeah. 
Where are we on the search of the apartment complex? 
Nothing so far. 
LAPD there yet? 
They're on their way. 
I'll be at comm. 
I can't do this. 
You can't do what? 
I can'T... 
sacrifice the lives of all those people if this warhead goes off. 
She called me. 
Who? 
Who called you? 
The hostile who has Tony. 
When? 
What did she say? 
A couple minutes ago. 
She said to redeploy our men so she can get away. 
Or Tony dies. 
Yes, sir. 
Patch me through to Jack Bauer's comm. 
Right away. 
Take your team. 
Start working the second floor, building 11. 
Jack, you read me? 
Yeah, I copy. 
We've got something. 
The suspect contacted Michelle. 
She confirmed she's holding Tony hostage. 
She's trying to use him as leverage against Michelle to open up an escape route. 
Is Michelle there? 
I'm right here, Jack. 
Do we have any idea where she is? 
She wants me to clear a path in the northeast driveway. 
She's going to call to confirm that I did it. 
When? 
I don't know. 
Could be any second. 
Michelle, I want you to make her believe that you're still cooperating with her. 
I need you to draw her into the open. 
I promise you that we will do everything we can for Tony. 
Okay. 
Stay ready for her call. 
Bill, I'm gonna pull all our units out of the northeast driveway, put them in concealed positions outside the complex. 
It's still possible she'll change her mind at the last minute and try another escape route. 
I know, and we'll be ready for that, but if she doesn't, I want her to believe that Michelle's still complying. 
As soon as she's 50 yards outside of the complex and can't reenter- that's when our teams will converge. 
Let me know when your men are ready to redeploy. 
Copy that. 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
I was gonna do what she wanted. 
Michelle... 
I didn't call you right away. 
All I could think of, at first, was saving Tony's life. 
It's okay. 
It's done. 
All designated teams, prepare to move into your secondary positions on my command. 
Curtis? 
What do you need me to do? 
Some of the residents aren't cooperating with the search. 
I want you to have LAPD units start arresting anybody that's giving us a problem. 
You got it. 
Why don't we pull some of the resources off the search? 
We have a better chance of finding the hostile through her communication with Michelle. 
No. 
The hostile's gonna be looking for any sign that Michelle's betrayed her. 
We have to follow procedure as if we have no idea they've been in contact. 
Understood. 
As soon as you're done with LAPD, I need you with me. 
You got it. 
Bill, this is Jack. 
Do you copy? 
Yeah, Jack. 
We're ready to go down here. 
Any new communication with the hostile? 
No. 
Michelle's still waiting for her call. 
Have you been able to make any kind of id on scene? 
Forensics tried to pull prints from her last known position, but they came up with nothing. 
Same result here. 
No match on the voiceprint. 
She's managed to stay completely under the radar. 
We're gonna have to hope that because how fast this is moving, she slips up and makes a mistake. 
Otherwise, we're in trouble. 
Proceed when ready, Jack. 
We're standing by. 
Copy that. 
All northeast driveway teams, move in to secondary positions. 
We're a go. 
Hi. 
What are you doing? 
Hey. 
You were supposed to stay in your apartment. 
Don't you know there's some crazy person loose in the building? 
Yeah, I know, I know. 
Hey, man. 
Where's Joz? 
He just got up. 
Can you just get him, 'cause I just need to talk to him? 
Something happened. 
Joz. 
What's going on Nothing. 
Just weird stuff. 
What? 
Nothing. 
Why don't you just tell me? 
No, it's cool. 
Hey, what's going on, Rothenberg? 
Hey, man. 
How are you? 
Not a sound. 
I just got off a very disturbing phone call from the Chinese foreign secretary. 
So they're still pressing us on the attack on the consulate? 
It's much worse than that, David. 
The fallout from that attack you authorized is escalating. 
They're determined to pin this on us. 
If they manage to confirm that this is one of our men, I don't have to tell you what kind of a disaster that would be. 
No, sir, you don'T. 
But this alone is not conclusive enough for the Chinese to turn this into an international incident. 
But if they find corroborating evidence? 
CTU is doing whatever they can to prevent that from happening, including getting this agent out of sight until it blows over. 
I know I gave you the authority to make the decision, but you never should have ordered that assault. 
If we hadn't carried out the raid, sir, we'd be nowhere on stopping the missile. 
And where are we, David? 
Is there some progress I don't know about? 
CTU is closing in on one of Marwan's associates. 
If they apprehend her in time, they feel that they can use her to find Marwan. 
Do you know how speculative that sounds? 
My god, we're never gonna find it in time. 
Don't say that! 
We will stop it. 
But you must believe that if you're gonna lead today. 
How am I gonna believe that? 
Every second that passes brings that missile closer to its target, which for all we know, is us. 
We are not sitting on our hands, Mr. President. 
We are using every resource at our disposal to find this missile. 
We will prevent the warhead from going off. 
I wish I was as confident as you are. 
You need to be. 
Remain Presidential. 
Demand nothing less than success from your people, and you will get it. 
All right. 
All right. 
What do I tell the Chinese foreign secretary when I talk to him next? 
You don'T. 
Let Mike handle this. 
You'll tell them, unless they have proof of our involvement, you don't want to hear from them today. 
Mr. Buchanan, Agent Bern on six. 
Send it to my cell phone. 
Yes, sir. 
Buchanan. 
It's Agent Bern, sir. 
I got a message to call you as soon as I landed in San Diego. 
Are we on a secure line? 
Yes, sir, it's an encrypted cell. 
The Chinese are continuing to press the case that we were involved in the assault on their consulate. 
Have they managed to find evidence beyond the surveillance video of me? 
No. 
And we have to make sure they don'T. 
I want you to start fabricating an alibi with CTU in san diego. 
I want you to make it to look like you were working there during the assault. 
Our transport's arriving right now, sir. 
I'll get right on it. 
The alibi has to withstand careful scrutiny. 
The San Diego phone logs, rosters, and mainframe records all have to back it up. 
It'll be airtight, sir. 
It has to be. 
Sir, about my family. 
Do you think there's any chance that the Chinese will try to get to them? 
They can'T. 
We've already contacted your wife, and we've moved her and your kids to a hotel for the time being. 
I'll be in touch, agent. 
Thank you very much, sir. 
Drive! 
What the hell is this? 
I think you already know what "this" is. 
CTU sent a team into our consulate just a few hours ago. 
You were on the team, and our consulate general was killed. 
You're going to tell me who was responsible. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Really? 
Then why were you being transported here by helicopter from CTU Los Angeles? 
You don't know where I came from. 
Actually, I do. 
Before entering CTU earlier tonight, we turned our satellite on that location. 
While I was questioning your superiors, our satellite picked up someone being taken away by helicopter. 
So what? 
That wasn't me. 
No, it was you! 
The Chinese government insists that someone take responsibility for the death of our consul. 
What does that mean... 
"take responsibility"? 
Now, I believe you were only following orders. 
Tell us who gave the orders, and I'll let you go. 
I'm not telling you anything. 
I believe you're going to change your mind. 
Yes? 
Have you redeployed all your men? 
Yes, I have. 
Bill? 
It's Jack. 
Uplink is on. 
Are you sure they followed your instructions? 
I'm sure. 
It's starting to rain pretty hard, Jack. 
Michelle... 
do you love Tony? 
Yes, I love him. 
Good. 
Because if I find out that you're trying to play me, the very first thing I'm going to do is blow his brains out, and don't think that there's anything you can do to stop it, 'cause there's not, understand? 
Okay, I understand. 
Good. 
Stay by the phone. 
All comm analysts, clone this call and filter it through all our servers. 
Do you have a multiple source on audio? 
 No. Just one Telco feed low res. 
 No, I know the configuration, Edgar. 
I need to know if we can multiplex, pull some background noise off. 
We need to pinpoint the source. 
I was going to do that. 
When? 
This is happening now! 
 I shouldn't have to walk you through this, damn it! 
You don't have to walk me through this. 
I'm setting it up now. 
Go to delta two, Edgar. 
It's all there. 
I will not let this thing fall apart because of technical incompetence. 
All right, I've got confirmation. 
All our visible forces have been pulled away from this street all the way to western. 
Okay, good. 
Jack. 
We've got something. 
Building three, west entrance. 
Edgar, video feed. 
Yes? 
Okay, Michelle, we're on our way. 
Okay, it's them. 
I've got a gun on Tony. 
My finger's on the trigger. 
If I move it, he's going to die. 
I told you, I moved my men. 
She's completely in the open. 
She's running a huge risk exposing herself like that. 
So far, so good. 
She's crossing the street. 
When she gets into the car, she can't stay on top of him. 
That's our opportunity. 
She's moving towards the black jag. 
All teams, hold your position Okay, here's the deal. 
As soon as we're in the car and we've cleared the area, I'm going to call you, and I'm going to tell you where you can find Tony. 
Okay. 
All right, move, move. 
Bill, not yet. 
All teams stand down! 
I see your men, Michelle. 
You lied to me, you bitch. 
You are not going to take me alive, got it? 
No! 
No! 
Bill, they're gone. 
She blew herself up in the car, and she took Tony with her. 
They're gone. 
I understand Bill Buchanan requested a conference call. 
Yes, sir. 
We were waiting for you to begin. 
Bill, we're all here; go ahead. 
I'm afraid that Marwan's associate the woman we hoped would help us locate the missile has killed herself and one of our agents. 
Oh, my god. 
Bill, did she leave behind any physical evidence that could help us? 
It doesn't appear so. 
So, what is CTU going to do now to find the missile? 
Mr. President, at this point, 
CTU no longer has any reasonable expectation of finding the missile before it reaches its target. 
This is it; it's going to happen. 
What do we do? 
At this point, we have no choice but to alert all state and federal agencies, and focus all our resources on managing the aftermath. 
But we don't even know the missile's target. 
We can assume it will be a major city. 
But no matter what the target is, there will be widespread panic across this country. 
We need to mobilize the army and the national guard in every state, and draw up a declaration of martial law. 
Yes, we need to do that. 
Bill, all federal agencies need to prepare for the aftermath of a nuclear attack. 
CTU's priority should be disaster management. 
Redeploy your people now. 
Understood. 
Edgar Stiles. 
Edgar, tell Jack the field operation is over. 
Have him bring his people back here immediately. 
Got it. 
The worst disaster in this country's history is taking place on my watch! 
I gave you the responsibility to stop this. 
You failed me, David. 
And you failed your country. 
I can't even imagine what you must be feeling. 
I know... 
part of you is second-guessing your decision... 
but you couldn't place Tony's life before the lives of potentially millions of people. 
You made exactly the decision Tony would have wanted you to make. 
That's our job. 
That's why we signed on. 
We decided we were going to leave this. 
Go somewhere and start again. 
Michelle... 
I want to get back to work. 
We still have to find this missile. 
No, I want you to go home. 
I'll be okay, Bill. 
That's not advice. 
That's an order. 
Buchanan. 
Sir, Jack says he's not pulling his men out yet. 
Did you tell him we have orders from the White House? 
Yeah, but he says he's not ready. 
Put him on the video phone in the situation room. 
You lied to me, you bitch. 
You are not going to take me alive, got it? 
Play it again. 
Give me more damn volume on the phone call. 
Jack, we need to redeploy. 
Just do it! 
Jack. 
Tony's gone. 
I'm sorry, Curtis. 
Just play it again, please. 
Okay. 
Jack, you've got a phone call. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, why haven't you redeployed? 
The operation's over. 
The hostile killed herself. 
Because it doesn't make any sense, Bill. 
Everything that we know about this woman tells us that she's a professional, not a fanatic. 
We had her cornered. 
Her next move was to try and negotiate for her freedom, not kill herself. 
In theory, I agree with you, but you saw what I saw. 
All I saw were two darkened figures in the rain concealed by an umbrella, and an explosion, and I saw that from half a block away. 
Jack, you've got to focus now. 
Nobody here is holding you responsible for Tony's death. 
You got to let this go. 
Bill, you're not listening to me. 
Jack, we reviewed the tactical feed. 
There is nothing to suggest we were deceived. 
Look, I know Tony was your friend, and you probably feel responsible for getting him involved today. 
This is not about Tony! 
This is about her, and until I can absolutely confirm that she is dead, I am maintaining this perimeter, and I am going to continue this search. 
Jack, I'm working under orders from the White House. 
You have ten minutes, then I want you to move out. 
Can you enhance the image from here? 
Not in the field. 
Then play it again Okay, here's the deal. 
I still can't hear the audio properly. 
Give me a headset. 
I'm going to call you, and I'm going to tell you where you can find Tony. 
I see your men, Michelle. 
You lied to me, you bitch. 
You are not going to take me alive, got it? 
Play back the last 15 seconds. 
What are you seeing, Jack? 
It's not what I'm seeing. 
Come on, play it back. 
I see your men, Michelle. 
You lied to me, you bitch. 
It was pouring rain. 
You can see it bouncing off the car. 
You can't hear it on her side of the phone call. 
She was making that call from somewhere else... 
indoors. 
She'd want a position that would give her a clear line of sight to the car. 
That would put her in the building that the couple exited from. 
Get the teams ready; we're moving in now. 
Alert all teams. 
We'll converge on building 11. 
Well, they're heading back in. 
Looks like my neighbors died for nothing. 
They know you're still in here. 
Open up the palm of your hand. 
Here are the keys. 
Take off your cuffs. 
Put these on. 
We're getting out of here. 
Okay, now cuff yourself back up. 
Let's go. 
We got every way in and out of the building covered, and we got men on every floor going room by room. 
We need to take her alive. 
Everyone's aware. 
Agent Bauer. 
Yeah? 
We found fresh blood outside an apartment. 
Where? 
208. 
Stand down until we get there. 
Copy that. 
Curtis take the door. 
Curtis, she went this way. 
Turn around. 
Move. 
Don't move! 
Drop the gun! 
It's over! 
Take one more step, and I'll kill him. 
Do it, Jack. 
Do what you have to do. 
Shut up. 
Do you really have what it takes to let me kill him while you're looking him in the eye? 
Yes. 
I believe you. 
So what's to stop me from shooting him? 
You can'T... 
kill me, can you? 
You need me. 
Tony. 
Hostile is down. 
I repeat, the hostile is down. 
Get a medic down here. 
I want her conscious as soon as possible. 
Look at me. 
You okay? 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
Get me that medic now! 
He's on his way. 
Does Michelle know I'm alive? 
No, not yet. 
I'll call CTU on my cell so you can talk to her privately. 
Thanks. 
Buchanan. 
Bill, this is Jack. 
Jack, what's going on? 
Have you redeployed back to CTU? 
No. 
We just apprehended the hostile. 
What? 
She's unconscious, but she's unharmed. 
Tony's okay, too. 
Thank god. 
I'll alert the White House. 
Okay, good. 
Bill, Tony wants to talk to Michelle. 
Can you put her on the line? 
She's not here. 
I sent her home. 
I'll, uh... 
I'll find her and patch her through to your cell. 
Thanks. 
Hello? 
Michelle, it's Bill. 
Tony's alive. 
What? 
He wasn't in the car. 
He's okay. 
I'll let Tony explain it to you. 
Hold on for him. 
Michelle, it's me. 
Tony? 
Oh, my god... 
it's okay, honey. 
Oh, my god... 
what happened? 
She made somebody else wear my clothes. 
She needed to keep me alive until she got out. 
Jack figured it out. 
He was able to save me. 
I don't know what to say. 
Look, you don't have to say anything, sweetheart. 
I'm coming to CTU right now. 
I'll see you in a few minutes. 
Michelle... 
I love you. 
I love you, Tony. 
Get President Palmer patch through. 
We're going to have to structure a deal. 
Yeah, all right. 
She's conscious. 
Pick her up! 
Call the White House now. 
Where is Marwan? 
That's what I thought. 
We're both professionals. 
You know that I can force this information out of you, but I'm running out of time. 
We never get second chances in our line of work, but I'm going to give you one. 
I have the power to give you a deal signed by the President of the united states that grants you immunity from past and present crimes. 
In exchange, you're going to help me find Marwan and stop this warhead from hitting its target. 
Do you understand? 
Do you understand? 
You are either going to help me now, or I will kill you. 
Show me the deal. 
You were part of the covert team that mounted the assault on our consulate an operation that resulted in the death of our consul. 
Who led the mission? 
Who is responsible for what happened? 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Please, Mr. Bern, you're wasting time. 
Give us a statement, and we'll release you. 
I'm telling you the truth, and you're going to have to release me as soon as CTU realizes what's happened to me. 
Actually, Mr. Bern... 
no one will ever know, and we will never tell them. 
What are you talking about? 
The China queen container ship is moored at the port of San Diego. 
If you don't give us our statement, we'll put you on board, and you will arrive in 18 days in the port of Hangzhou. 
Then we will transport you 2,800 miles to the province of Xinjiang, where you will be remanded to the maximum security labor camp on the border with siberia. 
You wouldn't do that. 
Why wouldn't we, Mr. Bern? 
We want justice. 
If you're not going to tell us who was ultimately responsible for the situation at the consulate, that leaves you. 
Your wife and your two daughters will not be notified. 
The U.S. Government will not be notified. 
Therefore, there will be no chance for prisoner exchange. 
There will be positively no chance of escape... 
for the rest of your life. 
Decide, Mr. Bern. 
The China queen is on a tight schedule. 
I don't know. 
All we want is a name a recorded statement naming the person responsible for what happened at the consulate. 
Then... 
then what happens? 
You will walk right out of that door. 
No, I meant... 
to him. 
As I said... 
all we want is justice. 
His name... 
is Jack Bauer. 
24 SO4E18  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: Mars Translator: sHiN3 Requiem Supervisor: rustyapple sHiN3 Previously On 24 This is air force one declaring an emergency. 
We're not gonna make it. 
I have to put it down now. 
Chloe, what's happening? 
Chloe! 
Air force one is down. 
This may be him. 
It's the president. 
He's still alive. 
I repeat, the president is alive. 
Marwan has to be within a 50-mile radius... 
Jack. 
There's a higher priority than finding Marwan. 
What is it? 
Recovering the nuclear football. 
Didn't it go down with air force one? 
The missile inflicted enough damage that the plane left a trail of debris as it went down. 
A lot of things were sucked out, including the football. 
That case contains the codes and locations of our entire nuclear arsenal. 
What's the location of the football? 
40 miles northeast of here in the middle of the desert. 
Air support! 
Football is in the lead jeep headed north. 
Take it out! 
I'm in possession of the football. 
Three hostiles are down, one escaped. 
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan. 
There's some pages missing. 
Tell me what the contents are of the missing pages. 
Jack, it's the red section which contains warhead locations and activation codes. 
If they get ahold of a warhead and a matching activation code, we will not be able to stop them. 
Mr. vice president... 
President Keeler is alive. 
But he's in critical condition. 
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th amendment and take control of things as soon as possible. 
You're worried about him? 
I am. 
He seems unsure of himself. 
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the united states, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the united states. 
Mr. President, I have just 
received a phone call from CTU. 
Part of the nuclear football has fallen into the hands of terrorists. 
The following takes place between 12:00 A.M. and 1:00 A.M. 
Vice president Logan has been sworn into office. 
He's now president of the united states. 
His office called, they want an update from us in 15 minutes. 
We're working on several protocols related to the plane crash. 
What is he going to want to focus on? 
He's going to want to know how a stealth fighter was stolen from one of our air bases and, more to the point, how it was able to take down air force one with one of our own missiles. 
Has he been briefed on Marwan? 
He knows Marwan is the mastermind behind today's events, yes. 
But he's going to want more specifics on the football. 
Where are we on that? 
Jack's at the debris field outside of indio. 
He's trying to reconstruct the red chapter of the playbook that was stolen by Marwan. 
How's he doing that? 
He's working with fred laughton from the department of defense. 
He wrote the codes, so he'll know what's missing. 
Good. 
Who's going to run point on this update? 
You and Tony. 
All right, everyone, we don't have a lot of time, so we're going to have to fast-track this. 
Double source all intel through homeland security and CIA. 
Skip the usual request procedures, tie into their data directly. 
yes? 
Ms. Dessler, I've got 
Jack Bauer on the line. 
Put him through. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
Michelle, are you still in briefing? 
Yes, Jack, you're on speaker. 
What have you found? 
Fred Laughton and I just finished a rough reconstruction of the red chapter- we're getting that over to you now. 
Jack, it's Bill Buchanan. 
Summarize our exposure. 
What information exactly does Marwan now have in his possession? 
Well, the red chapter lays out the location of our domestic nuclear arsenal. 
The inventory is in the thousands. 
Many of the weapons are in transit as part of our standard shift operations. 
Why can't DOD just secure these weapons? 
Because a number of the weapons are in between checkpoints. 
It would take over an hour to account for all of them. 
Listen, everyone, we've got to remember, Marwan only needs one. 
All right, Jack, we'll get on this immediately. 
Get back here as soon as you can and help Audrey liaison with dod. 
We need to account for every single weapon documented in that chapter. 
I'm on my way. 
The coordinates for the third one are latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes. 
Longitude 115 degrees, 21 minutes. 
There it is. 
Jefferson city, Iowa. 
When is the warhead due to arrive? 
7:00 A.M., Local time. 
Five hours from now. 
That puts it somewhere 200 miles east. 
It's still in illinois. 
We can intercept it anywhere from this point to here. 
All right. 
Let's put our people in place. 
The warheads that are in transit because of the daily shift-and-hide operations pose the biggest problem. 
We can verify military traffic in the coastal areas from here. 
Why don't we find out what DOD has in the midwest. 
Yeah, that's already underway. 
Audrey said she should have it in a few minutes. 
Look, Tony... 
am I interrupting something? 
No, Chloe. 
What is it? 
Are you logged on to division three? 
Yeah. 
Look at this: 15 minutes ago, the credit card of Eric Murphy was used at the western gas station in torrance. 
Who's eric murphy? 
His real name is yosik khatami. 
He's a terrorist affiliated with Marwan. 
How do we know that? 
Through a watch list. 
We put out a net asking for anybody connected to the name Habib Marwan. 
We didn't expect to get any hits so soon. 
Why was he so careless? 
Maybe he wasn'T. 
Maybe it's some sort of decoy. 
Well, it wouldn't be much of a decoy because we don't know where he is or what direction they're traveling in. 
This was a mistake. 
Did the gas station have a surveillance camera? 
Yes. 
He's driving a black lexus 300. 
Are we hooked into satellite? 
Yes, we're monitoring them now. 
If this guy's still on the road, we'll find him. 
Who do we have in the area to run point? 
Curtis just left division. 
He's heading over here right now. 
Divert him to western gas station. 
Have field ops meet him there. 
All right. 
This is audrey. 
Hey, it's me. 
Hey. 
Are you on your way back here? 
Yeah. 
How much of the weaponry has been accounted for so far? 
72 percent. 
We're having problems getting confirmations from the midwest. 
Why? 
There are several convoys shipping weapons to be dismantled in accordance with the arms reduction treaty. 
A lot of them were re-routed after the train bombing this morning. 
Just use local channels. 
All weapon transports have to check in with regional substations. 
Just call them directly. 
All right, I'll do that. 
How you holding up? 
I'm okay. 
What have the doctors told you about paul? 
They're having a hard time keeping him stable. 
You just hang in there. 
He'll fight through it. 
Yeah. 
Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes. 
All right, will do. 
Bye. 
yes. 
Marwan, it's me. 
Is everything all right? 
No. 
No, it's not. 
I made a stupid mistake. 
They're going to find me. 
What happened? 
I stopped to get gas. 
While I was driving away, I realized I used the wrong credit card, the one with the name Eric Murphy, the one you gave me. 
I told you to get rid of that one. 
I was in a hurry, Habib. 
I had to make the arrangements for the delivery of the warhead. 
When that transaction gets flagged, they'll be searching the highways. 
I know, that's why I'm not on the highway anymore. 
Where are you? 
Inglewood. 
I'm on my way to Prado's now. 
You're closer to the marina. 
Go straight there. 
I'll have him meet you. 
Prado can make arrangements to get you out of the country. 
Thank you, Habib. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President, it may be 
precipitous moving to the bunker now. 
Working from the oval office might exhibit a greater sense of confidence in our abilities to handle this crisis. 
The purpose of the bunker is to protect the president in times of crises, is it not? 
Yes, sir. 
now I feel it's always wiser to take the prudent course. 
Will I be able to function at 100 percent down here, mike? 
Absolutely, mr. President. 
What kind of protection does this bunker afford? 
Total. 
You're 200 feet below the surface. 
If the white house suffers a direct hit, everyone in the bunker would be safe, as would the communication infrastructure to the rest of the country. 
Let's hope that's not needed. 
Mr. President... 
Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line. 
Hello, Bill. 
What do you have for me? 
Mr. President, I'm here with 
Michelle dessler, director of CTU Los Angeles and Tony Almeida, heading up tactical. 
Good. 
Let's get started. 
Have all of our armaments referenced in the red chapter been secured? 
Not completely, mr. President, 
but we're working with DOD on that. 
What else do we know? 
The man who has choreographed today's events, Habib Marwan, is still at large. 
Most likely he is in possession of the red chapter. 
What are we doing to find him? 
We just picked up a thread, sir. 
We have a location where one of Marwan's associates was detected 20 minutes ago. 
That sounds promising. 
What else? 
We're sifting through all of our intel now. 
We're hoping to put together a pursuit scenario soon. 
So you're pretty confident you'll be able to catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan, before he strikes again? 
It's not an exact science, sir. 
All we can do is maximize the probability for success. 
There are no guarantees. 
Of course. 
I understand that. 
We need to get control of the situation. 
I can't run the government from down here indefinitely, but I'm not going upstairs until it's safe. 
Sir... 
I think their time is better spent working up what they have. 
I recommend we let them get back to it. 
Okay, bill... 
call us when you have something more concrete. 
Yes, sir, I will. 
All right, let's get back to it. 
Wait a second. 
Does anybody else feel uneasy about what we just heard here? 
In what way? 
Logan's supposed to the man who speaks to the people of this country and exudes confidence. 
Not fear. 
Air force one was just attacked, president Keeler is in critical conditional. 
Logan was just sworn in, give him time. 
We don't have time. 
We've got Yosik Khatami. 
A traffic cam picked him up, heading towards the coast. 
We have him on satellite. 
Link this up to Curtis, I want him running point on this takedown. 
Tell Curtis to remain discreet. 
I want to know what Khatami's doing, who he's meeting, before we take him down. 
Michelle... 
I was out of line before, about you and Bill. 
It's your life, and I've got no right to judge you. 
I appreciate that. 
And whatever tension there is between us, I want to apologize for my part in it. 
I'd like it if we could just let it go, so we could do our jobs. 
Leave the past in the past and move on. 
Sounds good. 
all right Curtis just called in. 
He's about to arrive at the marina and set up. 
Good, set up a satellite, also patch in an audio link. 
I'll take care of it now. 
Thanks, Edgar. 
You want me to run point on that? 
No, bill and I will do that, but I want you in on this. 
To do what? 
I'd like your tactical input. 
Fine, uh, I'll have Edgar transfer everything over to the situation room. 
I get the feeling Tony's not entirely comfortable with the configuration here today. 
We haven't seen each other for a very long time. 
It's uncomfortable for both of us. 
The difference is, you seem to be able to stay on point. 
I'm not so sure about him. 
I am He'll be fine. 
He's alone. 
What's he doing? 
It looks like a meet. 
He's waiting for someone. 
Is the marine unit in place? 
Yeah, behind the jetty. 
Looks like the man Yosik's meeting just arrived, he's walking towards him. 
Is it Marwan? 
I can't tell. 
Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive. 
All right, copy. 
All right, all teams, I'll close off the foot of the pier. 
Keep them contained, but do not shoot to kill. 
Repeat, do not shoot to kill. 
Damn it. 
Teams respond. 
Who is that? 
This is macallan at point three. 
It looks like a private patrol. 
All right, hold your positions. 
Yosik.. 
Brother. 
You're late. 
I've been standing here waiting for you. 
Well, I'm here now. 
Let's go. 
Come on. 
What are you waiting for? 
Wait. 
What's the matter? 
Someone's here. 
This is Miller. Blue base is clear. 
It's okay. 
It's just marina security. 
No, something's wrong. 
They're onto us. 
Yosik, now. 
The man he's meeting is not Marwan. 
Is there anybody else there besides the two of them? 
Not unless there's someone else on the boat. 
All right, marine units, move into position. 
All teams, move in. 
We're okay. 
I think we should just get out of here. 
There was a police officer out there. 
I told you, that's harbor security. 
They stop by all the time. 
Damn it. 
Who the hell's that? 
This is CTU. 
We have you completely surrounded. 
Yes? 
They found us! 
Where are you? 
It doesn't matter. 
It's over- they're going to get us. 
Yosik, you can't let that happen. 
You cannot allow yourself to be captured. 
I understand. 
Also, you have to kill Prado. 
He knows too much. 
I'll do what's necessary. 
Yosik? 
Yosik? 
Come out with your hands up! 
You're completely surrounded. 
There's no escape. 
Drop the gun! 
Put the gun down! 
Step off the boat. 
Get off the boat. 
There's a man inside. 
I shot him- he was gonna kill me. 
He was trying to steal my boat. 
It was self-defense. 
Put your hands on your head. 
Who are you? 
Who are you? 
My name's Joe prado I'm innocent. 
I have nothing to hide. 
Where's Yosik? 
He's dead. 
This phone was lying next to him. 
Get him out of here. 
let's go Secure the boat. 
Yosik's dead. 
We have the man he was meeting. 
He says his name is Joe Prado. 
Bring him in. 
We also recovered Yosik's cell phone. 
We'll try and pull something off it. 
I'll report to you en route. 
Good work, Curtis. 
We're standing by. 
What do you want to do? 
Control the situation. 
Make sure Prado doesn't talk to the authorities. 
He can hurt us. 
How do we get to him? 
We can'T. 
Not directly. 
Hello? 
This is Marwan. 
Yes, Marwan? 
Can you reach amnesty global at this hour? 
For what? 
An attorney. 
I'm sure I can. 
Tell them that an innocent man is being held without charges and is about to be tortured at CTU Los Angeles. 
By god's grace, President Keeler survived, but more than 75 others did not. 
I share in your grief and anger from this tragedy. 
My family and I feel no differently than each and every one of you. 
We are shocked, saddened and maybe a little afraid. 
These terrorists have displayed, once again, their indifference toward human life. 
They will pay for what they have done, I assure you. 
Bill, excuse me. 
There's a convoy missing. 
What? 
It was headed from Illinois to Jefferson city, Iowa- it disappeared just inside the border. 
Disappeared? 
They were due to call in at their checkpoint every 20 minutes, they didn'T. 
I tried to reach them on comsat. 
There was no reply. 
What about satellite? 
Nothing showing up. 
What was on the trucks? 
A nuclear warhead. 
Our faith and our resolve will prevail. 
Okay, we've got the fingerprints. 
I'll run them through our databases. 
thanks What do we know about the prisoner Curtis is bringing in? 
Just the name he gave: Joe prado. 
Curtis just uploaded his picture and prints. 
I'm running them through now. 
Prep holding so curtis can begin interrogation as soon as they arrive. 
I want this man broken in minutes, not hours. 
Clear all directories, put all resources into finding this warhead. 
Believe me, Mike, I wish I had known about this sooner, too. 
Look, I'm not pointing fingers here. 
I'm on your side, but the president is not going to be happy that the statement he made could be invalidated. 
I don't know what to tell you. 
We're putting everything we've got into finding this missing warhead. 
All right, we'll get back to you. 
Move! 
Inside! 
Let's go! 
Move, move, move! 
We've got it and we're heading out now. 
General Thomas just told me we're missing a nuclear warhead. 
Yes, I just heard some of the details from Bill Buchanan. 
When did this happen? 
It disappeared somewhere between 1:45 A.M. 
And 2:15 central time. 
None of our satellites was able to pick this up? 
It was in mountain terrain at night. 
Our people are analyzing the imagery now, but it's going to be hard to find. 
What are we going to do if we don't find this man Marwan? 
Our people are doing everything they can to contain him to the Los Angeles area. 
It's going to be difficult for him to leave. 
Yeah, well, it's difficult to shoot down air force one with our own stealth fighters, but he managed to do that. 
Who knows what else they're planning? 
I'm sure he's going to come after me next. 
Mr. President, there's no 
indication that that's his plan. 
You don't know that! 
I don't know that! 
We don't have enough information to know what his plan is! 
The head of Secret service is on his way over now. 
He has a revised plan that I'm certain will ease your mind about your safety. 
That's the bastard curtis found at the marina. 
The one that's helping the terrorists. 
I guess. 
I'd like to get him in a room for a few minutes. 
What? 
He'd talk to me in about ten seconds. 
Oh, you want to hurt him to get revenge for your mother dying. 
I can understand that. 
Take him to holding. 
Did Edgar run the prints I sent? 
Yeah. The name checks out. 
Joseph prado, ex-marine. 
No criminal record, but over the last five years, he's got no record of employment, either. 
Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary. 
That's right. 
I'll find out if he knows anything about the missing warhead. 
All right. 
Tony What do you got? 
I found the convoy I've just got off the Iowa highway patrol Millitary transfer was ambushed Everyone's dead what about the warhead? 
Gone Alright,find out what kind of vechile being used to transport also tell the local law-enforcement to put up premiters I want you to check for any airstrip server remotely clearence they might be able to put down a chopper Yeah Remember he's ex-marine He won't cave easily I just need to establish that even we're in the government building I'm gonna go as far as it takes How are you gonna start? 
i will use Richard OK I've told you i'm not talking to you,pal I haven't been doing anything wrong I killed that man,it was a self-defence,he was trying to steal my boat. 
We both know it's a lie So let's not wasting our time,what do you say,John? 
I'm not saying anyting to you. 
Now,you're lying to me What the hell is this? 
Yes Michelle,where's curtis? 
He's just about start with pardo Tell him to stop.

That's an order, both of you, come to the floor, now. 
 It was a self-defence - Curtis  You can't do this to me  Curtis What? 
Bill wants to see us before we start Wait till I get back What's this about? 
I don't know We have a problem with that This is david winston from amnesty globe And I have a signed court order here protecting the rights of joesff Prado who knew have been in custody You see US maschalls are here to assure that i'm taking to the prisoner immediately That's ridiculous That's your opinion But Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated 
Take me to him now We are not assured Curtis Do as he says There is a nuclear warhead missing This is our only lead Bill I'll get into this with the Justice Department. 
In the meantime do what he says When can i expect his call? 
It's extremely important Yes,i understand that but i need to talk to the judge immediately please have him called me back Mr. Buchanan 
Do you have those hourlies for me? 
No, i don't but i'm here on another matter you what? 
I heard the interrogation on prado have been put on hold that's right why you have a job to do,please get back to work I know i'm not supposed to be interfering in the matters of policy but considering what i have been through today my mother dying because of these terrorists i want to know why you let some slamy lawyer protect the dirty-bag like prado we don't happy that either,but we're gonna fix it but it's gonna take some time that's time we don't have Edgar stop i'm trying to cut you some slack here but you need to get back to your job you need to put all that stuff aside and hold for awhile yes,sir yeah, Cannon yes i'll hold for the judge what was that all about?you're 
supposed to be doing the hourlies. 
I know i don't want anybody keeps telling me what i'm supposed to be doing i have a photographic memory in case you forgot How can i forgot,you tell me like every other of the day i don't know why what's happened here we have some pc lawyer holding us up from doing our job your job is do the hourlies you're holding yourself up chole Have you heard of the mising warhead. 
yeah, FBI link up with our department yet? 
yes.i'm sharing both of databases 
OK. Good. who's questioning the prisoner 
You mean Joseph Prado that Curtis broght in yeah no one what are you talking about? the 
attorney came in from antis globe with a court order saying he won't allow to being-alone with Prado The attorney came in from amnesty globe with a court order saying we won't be allowed to being-alone with Prado Buchanan is on the phone with judge sending the order now I'll be right back. 
I don't believe this I disagree with you,you honor, this does not fall outside the boundary of patriot yeah,alright thanks what the hell is going on here you got the key witness on the missing warhead We should be pressing this guy with everything we've got Judge's known more If you want to appeal we should wait until 7 A.M. take him to the pillar judge 
does he know what the stakes are? 
he does,but he's feeling Prado got no record he shouldn't be treated like a terrorist What about the fact that he was caught meeting with known terrorist in the middle of the night on appear? 
Circumstantial we need to interrgoate this prisioner, I don't care what kind of court order we even get I agree but the attorney is with him U.S. Marshal's protecing his right. 
Where's attorney? 
In holding with Prado Jack, don't make it worse. 
I just want to talk to him. 
How much longer do I have to stay here? 
I'm trying to get you out as soon as I can. 
My office is in the process of filing a complaint. 
They have nothing on me. 
I was standing alone on my boat. 
I don't even know the man'd going after. 
Come in with me, Al. 
Who are you? 
My name is Jack Bauer, Department of Defense, and you are? 
David Weiss, amnesty global. 
Curtis, why is the suspect not in his restraints? 
Amnesty global's order supersedes our authority. 
Mr. Bauer, my client is cooperating. 
He's not trying to go anywhere. 
All he wants is to be treated like any other U.S. Citizen. 
Your client aided and abetted people who attacked the president of the united states today. 
You don't know that. 
As a matter of fact, we do. 
Then charge him. 
May I speak with you privately? 
Get the door. 
You and I both know that your client isn't clean and that he conspired to steal a U.S. Nuclear warhead. 
All my client wants is due process. 
Mr. Weiss 
these people are not gonna stop attacking us today until millions and millions of americans are dead. 
Now, I don't want to bypass the constitution, but these are extraordinary circumstances. 
The constitution was born out of extraordinary circumstances, Mr. Bauer. 
This plays out by the book, not in a backroom with a rubber hose. 
I hope you can live with that. 
Sir, can I help you? 
No, it's all right. 
How did you get here so fast? 
What?! 
Who asked you to represent Mr. Prado? 
I don't have to give you that information. 
Curtis, from the time of his arrest, did the suspect have time to call a lawyer? 
No. 
Marwan called amnesty global. 
This is his play. 
That means prado definitely knows something Marwan doesn't want us to hear. 
We still can't get around that court order. 
We need to call the president now. 
We cannot have any leaks regarding this missing warhead. 
I've contacted General Wilson in Iowa. 
He's sealing off the roads while we clean up the ambushed convoy. 
What about those highway patrol officers who discovered it? 
Wilson's already brought them in and is explaining the situation. 
The good news is, this is happening in the middle of the night. 
Most of the country's still asleep. 
yes. 
CTU Los Angeles is on the line for president Logan. 
They say it's urgent. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
That'll be all. 
Walt. 
Stay. 
Put 'em through. 
Go ahead, please. 
Mr. President, this is Bill Buchanan. 
I'm here with Jack Bauer. 
Yes, bill. 
What do you have for me? 
Sir, in the process of trying to track down this missing warhead, we brought a prime suspect in for questioning. 
What have you learned? 
Well, that's the problem, sir. 
Right now, our hands are tied. 
Amnesty global has interceded on his behalf. 
Interceded on what grounds? 
He's a U.S. Citizen with no previous record. 
Why is he a suspect? 
We found him with Yosik Khatami, the man who's linked to today's terrorist events. 
I don't understand. 
It doesn't violate any law to question a suspect. 
Mr. President, if I may...? 
Go ahead, Mike. 
Jack, it's Mike Novick. 
Hi, Mike. 
Am I correct in assuming that this suspect is unlikely to respond to the kind of q&a his lawyer would permit? 
That's correct, mike. 
If we want to procure any information from this suspect, we're gonna have to do it behind closed doors. 
You're talking about torturing this man? 
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to stop this warhead from being used against us. 
Give us a moment, Bill. 
Mike, what do you think? 
I think we need to do whatever it takes to find Marwan. 
Walt? 
Weigh in. 
Well, this makes me nervous. 
Why? 
Should this man be innocent, as he claims he is, your first act as president is to sanction his torture. 
Well, that'll... 
that'll forever haunt your presidency. 
All right, gentlemen. 
Here's what I'll agree to. 
I'll call a special session with members of the justice department and we'll discuss this. 
I'll have an answer for you in 20 minutes. 
Mr. President, this thing 
could be over in 20 minutes. 
That's as far as I'm willing to go right now. 
With all due respect, sir, please let us do our jobs. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
I'll have curtis start the interrogation of prado. 
You and I both know we can't afford to be wasting time like this. 
You heard the president. 
He's not going to let us touch this guy. 
The president's not here- you are. 
If I authorize this, they'll know in ten minutes. 
We'll all be out the door. 
What if I can find another way to handle this that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me? 
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack. 
You don't have to. 
What do you mean? 
Accept my resignation. 
And if I do that, what then? 
Release the suspect. 
Release him? 
We don't question him, don't charge him, we just let him go. 
He won't need a lawyer, or a marshal. 
You're going to take him on as a private citizen. 
yes? 
how far away are you? 
92 miles. 
When you get there, you'll meet with Morris. 
Is he the one who's going to configure the detonation? 
Yes. 
I've given him the codes. 
Okay. 
You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir. 
We cannot give the americans time to start an evacuation. 
Yes, Marwan. I understand. 
No delays. 
It'd be done. 
Hey, when did you get back? 
A few minutes ago. 
Thanks. 
Good. 
I could use your help on the DOD interface. 
I can't help you right now, Audrey. Sorry. 
What are you doing? 
I'll tell you when I get back. 
Jack... 
Jack! 
Audrey, please. 
What the hell are you trying to pull here? 
First you want to torture me, and now you're throwing me out? 
That's right. 
It's okay, Joe. 
I'm sure they tried to fight the restraining order, then realized they couldn'T. 
No, that's not what this is. 
They're doing something. 
Don't be so paranoid. 
We're just not interested in you anymore. 
I want protection when I get out of here. 
The marshal can escort back wherever you want to go. 
No, no, no! 
You know what? 
Change of plan! 
I don't want to leave here until I know I'm safe for the next few days. 
If you don't leave, I'm going to have to arrest you for trespassing in a secured government building. 
Once that happens, not even your attorney can protect you. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, David. 
He's right. 
What's going on? 
Where are they taking Prado? 
He's been released. 
Why? 
I don't know. 
It came from Buchanan. 
Mr. Buchanan, why are you letting him go? 
Edgar, not now, please. 
But he's working with the people that killed my mother. 
Not now. 
Cheer up, Joe, you're a free man. 
Yeah, free. 
The marshal's going to take you home. 
No. 
You kidding me? I can't go home. 
I've got to go somewhere public, like a hotel. 
Fine. 
Tell him where you want to go. 
Don't let anyone know you're there. 
Here's my card. 
You call me if anyone from CTU tries to bother you. 
Yeah, okay. 
You're going to be fine. 
make a sound, and I will blow your brains out, all over the windshield. 
Handcuff your left arm to the dashboard, now. 
now we're going to talk. 
now... 
you and I both know your heart isn't in this. 
You just wanted the money. 
I don't want you. 
All I want is Marwan. 
I don't know any Marwan. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Yeah, well, I'm running out of time here, so why don't we just cut to the chase. 
where's Marwan? 
I don't know! 
Where is Marwan?! 
Where is Marwan?! 
I don't know! 
I swear I don't! 
Okay, okay, okay, Marwan'S... 
Marwan's going to be at a place called the hub club tonight. 
Where is it? 
It's just... 
it's just east... 
where is it?! 
It's just east of downtown! 
Just east of downtown. 
24 SO4E21  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: Mars Translator: sHiN3 Supervisor: Requiem Previously On 24 People of America: You wake up today to a different world. 
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you. 
"You wake up today to a different world. 
" Do we take that literally? 
That he'll set off the warhead before dawn? 
A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marwan's associates. 
This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead. 
I will give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary. 
Mr. Koo, there's a man in your 
consulate by the name of Lee Jong. 
We need to take Mr. Lee into 
custody immediately for questioning. 
But Mr. Lee is a Chinese citizen. 
I can't just hand him over to you without going through channels. 
Jack, is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan? 
No, sir the e-mails he sent left no room for doubt. 
Then we have to get Lee out now and find out what he knows. 
Yes, sir. 
No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this... 
ever! 
Got him! 
Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van. 
Mr. President, the consul is dead. 
He was shot when armed men broke into this building and took Mr. 
Lee with them by force. 
Mr. Lee, tell me where Habib Marwan is. 
Damn it, we're losing him! 
Paul, what is it? 
I can drain off some of the fluid but we need to get him back into surgery now. 
Jack... 
Jack, what's going on? 
This man is our only connection to a stolen nuclear warhead. 
You've got to save him now. 
I already have a patient! 
You have a new one! 
If you don't save him, Billions of people will die. 
Jack... 
I have my orders. 
I'm doing my job. 
Paul's crashing. 
Jack, he's dead. 
Jack, you son of a bitch, you killed him. 
The following takes place between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. 
Gauze. 
Gauze. 
Is he going to make it? 
We're going to do the best we can. 
I just need him coherent long enough to get the information about Marwan and the missing warhead. 
I know, Jack. 
You already made me aware of that when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life. 
One milligram atropine! 
What is it? 
Jack, I don't have time right now. 
Jack, we need to leave. 
Let them do this. 
Gauze. 
I'll be right outside. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry. 
How could you? 
How could you kill him, Jack? 
How could you do it? 
No... 
No... 
no... I can't... 
I can't... 
be there right now. 
Please, Audrey... 
just tell me what you want me to do. 
Leave. 
I want you to leave, Jack. 
Jack, you need to call the white house right away. 
Mike Novick needs to speak with you. 
It's urgent. 
Okay, fine. 
What? 
Paul Raines just died. 
There was only one doctor and I had to make a choice between Lee's life and Paul'S. 
A-and I chose Lee. 
You did the right thing, Jack. 
You okay? 
No, I'm not okay. 
I'm sorry. 
Just tell me when Lee's out of surgery. 
I will. 
Mike Novick's office. 
This is Jack Bauer for Mike Novick. 
Please hold. 
Hello, Jack. 
Have you gotten anything useful out of Lee yet? 
No, he's still in surgery. 
How's that coming along? 
Not great, but he's hanging in there. 
I don't have to tell you we took a huge risk getting this guy, under the assumption that he can help us find the nuclear warhead. 
Trust me, Mike, I know. 
We also have a new situation. 
What is it? 
When you broke into the Chinese consulate, Koo Yin, the consul, was shot. 
That's not possible. 
My men never fired their weapons. 
Then he was accidentally hit by one of his own people. 
How badly was he hurt? 
He died, Jack. 
Oh, my god... 
I want you to talk to the members of your team. 
Make sure that each one of them has an alibi for where they were during the ambush. 
Okay. 
This is an extremely incendiary situation. 
I'm about to talk to President Palmer now. 
We're trying to avoid a serious confrontation with China. 
We'll handle it from here. 
Thanks, Mike. 
How did this happen? 
Mr. Buchanan, the network 
security module lit up. 
Someone on the outside is trying to jam our satellite servers. 
Could this just be a high network load? 
No, it's definitely a denial of service attempt. 
What do you want me to do? 
Do any damage yet? 
No, the Cisco system is self-defending. 
All right, have one of your people use the security auditor tool. 
Maybe it'll lead us to Marwan's network. 
That was my point from the start. 
Chloe. 
We're in an active code. 
We don't have time for your personality disorder. 
Do you understand me? 
Chloe? 
Yes or no? 
Yes, sir. 
This is Yasir. 
Is the warhead in place? 
Yes, but we have a problem. 
I can't jam their satellite. 
You assured me that you could handle it. 
CTU must have just installed new software. 
This wasn't in place last week. 
We're going to have to move our schedule forward by an hour. 
There won't be as many casualties if people aren't at work. 
If you can't jam the satellite signal, they'll find us. 
We can't let that happen. 
I understand. 
How long are we going to keep the President in the dark? 
Eventually he's going to find out that you authorized a raid on the Chinese consulate. 
We have to keep it from him as long as we can. 
Were you able to find Jack? 
Yes. He's back at CTU. 
The man they grabbed at the consulate, Lee Jong, is still in surgery. 
Was he able to tell us anything about the warhead? 
No. 
What did Jack have to say about the Chinese consul's death? 
It wasn't our people who fired the shot. 
The Chinese won't care. 
He died as a result of our trespass. 
We have to start constructing a scenario that doesn't implicate the united states government. 
They must know we did this. 
We called the consulate about Lee Jong half an hour before the abduction. 
The Chinese don't want a confrontation any more than we do. 
If we can create a scenario of plausible deniability, they may play along. 
How do we do that? 
Call CTU. 
Have them find out which anti-Chinese factions have attacked their embassies or consulates in the last five years. 
Most of these groups you're talking about are asian extremists. 
I'm sure Bauer's team was predominately americans. 
Bauer's team was masked. 
No one saw their faces. 
They were all masked? 
Yes. 
Wait. 
His mask was lifted. 
Use the image processing filters. 
OK Let me see. 
Send this image to Beijing and Shanghai. 
Have them cross-reference it with our intelligence databases. 
Find out who this man is. 
I will. 
Curtis, come here. 
Listen up. 
The Chinese consul was shot and killed during Lee's extraction. 
How? 
We never got a shot off. 
I know, I know. 
It must have been friendly fire. 
But look, we've got to make sure all our alibis cross check. 
No one outside of this operation is to know that we were anywhere near the Chinese consulate tonight. 
Understood? 
Jack, what's gonna happen? 
Are we going to be brought into this? 
I don't know yet. 
All I do know is now that the consul's been killed, everything has changed. 
It's our responsibility to make sure that the united states government is never implicated in this operation. 
Don't worry, Jack. 
Everyone here gets it. 
Okay. 
Curtis, you advise the rest of the team. 
You got it. 
Yasir. 
They're ready for you to make the changes. 
Do you think they'll find it before we launch? 
Not if I move up the launch time. 
They're looking for the warhead in their cities. 
They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile. 
Morrison? 
Yes, sir. 
Open up the guidance firmware. 
I'm going to upload a new instruction set. 
Yes, sir. 
Okay, go ahead. 
All right, you'll be ready to start the launch sequence as soon as we've reprogrammed the onboard. 
Good. 
Jack, prep all your databases. 
When Lee comes to, we're gonna have to move quickly. 
What about the warhead? 
We're meeting on it now. 
Chloe, I need you to free up a server for a large D.O.D.Block transfer 
it'll be coming through a locked channel from Heller's office. 
Has that been authorized? 
No, not yet, I still have to talk to Audrey. 
That's gonna be weird. 
What? 
Talking to Audrey, I mean, you had to do what you did and her husband died. 
It's probably destroyed your relationship with her. 
Chloe, please, just free up the server. 
Okay. 
Jack, I just want you to know that if you need anyone to talk to as a friend, I'm here for you. 
Not now, but later, when things calm down. 
Thanks. 
Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you. 
I need you to call Marcy, authorize a block transfer. 
We need all pertinent D.O.D. 
Databases sent over here to CTU. 
Were you able to keep Lee alive? 
Yeah, he's stabilized. 
All right. 
I'll call Marcy. 
Thank you. 
Now the warhead was stolen here, in eastern Iowa. 
We don't yet know how it's being transported Are we monitoring air traffic? 
Yes- so far nothing's been picked up. 
Well, if they have to stay on the ground, how far could they have gone? 
Based on our latest information, 300-mile radius, which includes three metropolitan areas. 
Have those cities been alerted? 
The President wants to keep that information restricted for the time being. 
We have raised local alert levels, but haven't mentioned specifics. 
Marwan and his people have control of the nuclear warhead. 
We have to figure out when and where he's going to set it off. 
I want you looking at everything from satellite to local police. 
We have a small window. 
It's still the middle of the night. 
If Marwan leaves a trail, it's going to be a hell of a lot easier to follow it now than in two hours when people start going to work. 
Let's get to it. 
We think this is the man you asked us to find. 
But you're not sure. 
There was a good match on a lot of the available characteristics. 
Howard Bern. 
Member of a tactical unit for CTU Los Angeles What are you going to do? 
Talk to him. 
How? CTU won't let you anywhere near him. 
They'll have to. It would 
be a diplomatic mistake for them not to cooperate under the circumstance. 
Get me the head of CTU Los Angeles. 
There's a program at division you can filter those markers through. 
It'll tell you which ones are good. 
Yeah? 
I've got a Mr. Cheng from the Chinese 
consulate who wants to speak to Michelle. 
This is Michelle Dessler. 
Ms. Dessler, my name is Cheng Zhi, head 
of security for the Chinese consulate. 
I'm sure your office is aware of the incident that happened here earlier tonight. 
Yes, we were very sorry to hear about it. 
Is there anything we can do to help? 
I would like to come over and discuss this matter with you. 
Of course. 
My office would be more than glad to make an appointment with you in the morning. 
No, I need to do that right now. 
I'm afraid that's impossible. 
You must know we're in the middle of a national security crisis. 
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war. 
What does that have to do with us? 
I believe your agency stormed the consulate and kidnapped Lee Jong. 
That is an outrageous accusation. 
Just an hour earlier, your government called and asked for permission to speak to Lee Jong. 
30 minutes later we were attacked. 
It is unlikely these two events are unrelated. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng, I can't help you. 
I suggest you cooperate voluntarily. 
Otherwise, I'll be forced to go above you on this. 
I'm sure you'll do what you have to. 
I mean no disrespect, but I do have to get back to work. 
Very well, Ms. Dessler. 
You'll be hearing from me soon. 
Get me Secretary of State Taylor Tell him it's an urgent matter. 
Comm just confirmed that we got the data from Marcy, thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Yeah. 
Audrey, you should get some rest. 
With everything that's going on, I can't. 
You could go back to the hotel. 
Jack, please don't tell me what to do. 
What? 
Jack, what do you want from me? 
You made a choice that killed Paul, and I'm trying to deal with it. 
We both have a job, let's just do it. 
Jack. 
Michelle says the head of security at the Chinese consulate just called. 
What? 
He made it sound like he has evidence linking CTU to the abduction of Lee. 
What kind of evidence? 
He didn't say, but he wants to come down here and talk to us. 
They don't have any evidence, they're bluffing. 
Bill, we don't have time to deal with them right now. 
I agree, but we don't have much choice. 
I need you to help me figure out how to deal with this, Jack. 
I need to check on Lee's condition first. 
I'll get back to you. 
All right CTU just sent this over. 
These five groups have all made attempts to attack or sabotage Chinese targets around the globe in the last two years. 
This group here... 
people's freedom coalition? 
They've actually made speeches where they referenced Lee Jong's involvement with the Chinese nuclear program. 
So an attack on the consulate and the grab of Lee Jong by this group would be plausible. 
It would allow the Chinese to save face. 
And if the Chinese can't provide proof that we entered the consulate, saving face may be all they need. 
If you want, I can start leaking it to the media. 
Do it. 
Mr. President. 
David, what have you done? 
Excuse me, sir? 
I just got a call from the secretary of state telling me about a covert action against the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. 
That's correct. 
I sanctioned it. 
Why would you have done such a thing? 
It was the only option at the time. 
Don't you know how fragile our relationship with China is right now? 
You authorized an attack on their consulate! 
That's a military engagement. 
It was a covert operation, not dissimilar to those carried out by countries on a routine basis around the world. 
Don't give me a social studies lesson, David. 
We marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals and in the process the Chinese consul was killed. 
We were unlucky, sir. 
Unlucky? 
Yeah, I would say that we were unlucky. 
That's the kind of thing that could start a war now how am I supposed to be able to fight terrorists while I'm provoking a nuclear superpower? 
I would advise you to calm down, sir, if we're going to get through this day. 
We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves, but we're going to be the ones to settle it. 
This is a dirty business, and we're gonna have to get our hands dirty to clean it up. 
Now, please, Mr. President, 
you brought me here to help you. 
Let me do it. 
Tony, what's the latest on Lee? 
He's out of surgery. 
Dr. Besson thinks he'll be able 
to respond to questions soon. 
All right, when that happens, I want everyone from comm on standby. 
Whatever information Lee gives us on the warhead I want worked up without any time lags. 
We're clear about this, correct? 
Yes, sir. 
good That was secretary of state Taylor. 
He just authorized the head of security at the Chinese consulate to come here and question us about the raid. 
What? 
In the middle of all this? 
All right. 
This breaks down very simply. 
They want to prove that we attacked the consulate tonight. 
We have to make sure they can't do that. 
Well, that ambush has got to land on someone. 
Mike Novick's working on that from Washington. 
We just have to make sure all our bases are covered here. 
Finding that nuclear warhead is our number one priority. 
I'm going to go over the strategy with Jack. 
When Cheng gets here, send him to the situation room, make sure all our visible screens are masked. 
Okay. 
This situation with the consulate is dragging us down. 
We shouldn't be diverting resources away from finding that warhead. 
Hopefully this will just be a formality and we can get rid of him quickly. 
If we don't get information from Lee, Audrey's husband will have died for no reason. 
What is she still doing here? 
I think she wants to stay busy so she doesn't have to think about it. 
It's funny, when I met Audrey this afternoon, it seemed like she and Jack were totally together. 
A few hours later, everything's changed. 
Michelle... 
I hate being without you. 
I never wanted it to be this way. 
Cheng's here. 
Send him to the situation room. 
Buchanan and Jack are waiting there for him. 
Shouldn't we keep him more isolated than that? 
No. 
We have to give the impression we have nothing to hide. 
All right. 
Mr. Cheng. 
Yes. 
I'm Curtis Manning. 
Hello, Mr. Manning. 
Our regional director is waiting for us in the situation room. 
If you'll follow me... 
good. 
Mr. Cheng. 
Bill Buchanan. 
Pleasure to meet you in person. 
My condolences for the loss of your consul. 
Thank you. 
This is Jack Bauer from the department of defense, he's working for us today. 
Mr. Cheng, please take a seat. 
I know of Mr. Bauer, of course, from 
his previous service to this country. 
We knew you were in Los Angeles today. 
When did you arrive? 
Flew in from Washington a couple of days ago with Secretary Heller. 
I assume, then, secretary Heller is still here. 
No. 
For security reasons, he's at our district office. 
Why aren't you with him? 
We felt, under the circumstances today, I could be more helpful here at CTU with Bill. 
That's odd. 
Not really. 
As you know, I used to run this office. 
So if there's anyone capable of leading a covert operation under short notice, you would be the ideal candidate. 
Mr. Cheng, this kind of unfounded... 
That's all right, Bill, I've got it. 
Mr. Cheng, I can assure you that 
neither CTU nor i had anything to do with the terrible events that took place at your consulate tonight. 
I assume you know this man- Howard Bern. 
One of your field agents. 
This was taken by one of our surveillance cameras tonight. 
This photograph has been altered. 
Just to make it clearer. 
Or to set up a scenario that you can utilize for political propaganda. 
No, Mr. Bauer. 
We ran this image through our database. 
The computer picked Mr. 
Bern as a near perfect match. 
Did you take the time to cross-reference your database to include members of the people's freedom coalition? 
Because according to our information, they're the group most likely behind this attack. 
That would be pointless, wouldn't it? 
This man is not asian. 
Mr. Cheng, 
you and I both know that the PFC has initiated terrorist activity around the globe utilizing european mercenaries, half a dozen of which are a closer match to this photograph than agent Bern. 
I take it, then, Mr. Bern 
is not available to question? 
No, he's not here tonight. 
Of course. 
Mr. Cheng, you must know 
that it would not be in America's best interest to provoke the Chinese government. 
Then what are we playing these games for? 
30 minutes before we were attacked, you asked our consul to give up Lee Jong. 
Before our government can comply, the consulate was attacked, Lee Jong disappeared. 
Now you tell me you don't have Lee Jong. 
Howard Bern is not available to be questioned. 
What are you trying to hide? 
We're not trying to hide anything, sir. 
We're just extremely busy. 
Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
This is Bauer. 
We are faced with unprecedented terrorist attacks on american soil. 
All of our resources and attention are focused on trying to stop those attacks. 
Thank you. 
We have confirmation on Marwan's last location. 
Follow up on that. 
I'll handle the rest of Mr. Cheng's questions. 
I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr. Bauer. 
I'll see what I can do. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Have Bern meet me in the east corridor. 
Get a chopper ready now. 
I will. 
Meet Jack in the east corridor now. 
Dispatch. 
This is Chloe O'Brian Jack Bauer's requesting a helicopter standing by for immediate departure. 
Okay, done. 
Thank you. 
Come on, follow me. 
What's going on? 
A security camera at the Chinese consulate picked up your face. 
That's impossible. 
I was wearing my mask. 
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame. 
It was you. 
Jack, the guy ripped the mask from my face for one second. 
I pulled it right back down. 
I can't believe a camera picked that up. 
I had no idea. 
You're going to have to leave the city. 
We're working out a scenario. 
In a couple days, you're going to have to answer questions from the Chinese. 
I didn't think anyone saw me. 
That's why I didn't bring it up earlier. 
Don't worry, we're gonna handle it. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
You got to go. 
There's a chopper waiting for you. 
This is Bauer.. 
Jack, Lee Jong's coming out of anesthesia. 
He should be ready for questioning now. 
Agent Rabb's already there. 
I'm on my way. 
Are you ready? 
All my databases are active. 
Okay, good. 
Doctor, that's enough. 
He's mine now. 
Thank you. 
Tell him he's in critical condition, he still needs medical attention I'm going to ask him a few questions. 
When he answers them, I'll let the doctor continue to treat him. 
He understands. 
Tell him I know that he worked with Marwan on the warhead. 
Now he needs to tell us where it is. 
He doesn't know. 
But he knows where Marwan might be. 
What do you mean, where he might be? 
In the van he told me he knew where he was. 
Because of what he's doing, Marwan's been moving around. 
Where? 
There are three locations he knows of that Marwan's using today. 
What are they? 
The Rocklyn building... 
we know about that one. 
A bar downtown. 
We know about that one, too. 
A factory on sixth. 
Where on sixth? 
Alameda... 
sixth and alameda. 
Give me an exact address. 
That's the one we're looking for. 
I need you to assemble a team, make sure Curtis is on it. 
They need to be ready to move now. 
Yeah. 
Audrey. 
Yes? 
The investigator from the Chinese consulate wants to talk to you. 
Why does he want to talk to me? 
In order to protect Jack's cover, we put together some new hourlies for him to look at They show you and Jack working together at the time of the ambush. 
Buchanan wants me to lie to the Chinese to protect Jack? 
Not to protect Jack- to protect the united states government. 
Is that gonna be a problem? 
Where are the hourlies? 
Edgar's sending them to your system. 
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, Curtis. 
I understand. 
Well, whatever you decide, you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng. 
What's happening? 
Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan. 
We're getting ready to move on it now. 
I'm being called in for questioning. 
By who? 
Cheng, from the Chinese consulate. 
Come here. 
Why you? 
Buchanan modified the hourlies so that it'd look like you were working here with me during the abduction. 
I'm sorry, but whatever Buchanan laid out, you got to stick to it. 
We need to sideline Cheng now. 
Why? 
Now that Lee Jong's incriminated himself, the Chinese government's not gonna try to protect him. 
That's not what this is about. 
The Chinese consul was killed during Lee's extraction. 
The united states government cannot be held responsible for that. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
You have broken every major protocol set by CTU and the dod. 
For what? 
Is any of this working? 
You're still alive, your father's still alive, and we managed to stop all but one of the power plants from melting down. 
Yeah, it's working. 
We have to fight to keep it working. 
Do what you have to, Audrey. 
I'm sorry, I've got to go. 
Thank you. 
Hello. 
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack's 
approach to Marwan's location ready. 
Good. 
Upload it to the teams; send a copy to Tony's station. 
He's running point on this end. 
You got it. 
I am surprised that after you were kidnapped that you stayed on to work here. 
That must have been very difficult for you. 
I wasn't physically hurt, and I wanted to try and help find the people who had planned these attacks. 
Very admirable. 
Now, I looked through the hourlies for Mr. 
Bauer, your associate from the defense department. 
I noticed from 1:00 A.M. 
To 3:00 A.M, you and he were working 
on some data-processing tasks. 
Yes, that's correct. 
And what analyst did you give this information to? 
Edgar Stiles. 
Why does that matter? 
They go through all this trouble to reenlist a man who used to run this place Jack Bauer and he's doing data-processing? 
Well, it's much more subtle than it sounds. 
There are hundreds of lists that have to be cross-referenced, and with Mr. Bauer's experience, 
we were able to narrow the search. 
I am surprised. 
Why is that? 
Meaning no disrespect, the log shows that your husband,Paul Raines, was at the clinic during the same hours. 
And unfortunately, he passed away. 
What's your point? 
I don't believe you were with Jack Bauer, mining data. 
That you were waiting for your husband while he was in surgery, and that you are lying to me now to cover for Mr. Bauer. 
Mr. Cheng. 
I'm not going to allow you to stand there and accuse my people of lying. 
No. 
And I'm not going to stand here to endure half-baked alibis. 
You can believe whatever you want, but my answers stand. 
Now, if we are done, I do have to get back to work. 
If you'll excuse me. 
Manning. 
President Palmer for Jack Bauer. 
It's the White House. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, this is David Palmer. 
Mr. President. 
CTU tells me you got something from Lee. 
We got a location on Habib Marwan. 
We're en route with tactical teams now. 
We're hopeful we can put an end to this soon. 
I hope you're right, Jack. 
This warhead can detonate any moment now. 
We know, sir. 
Jack... 
tell me about the representative from the Chinese consulate, Cheng. 
Is he still at CTU? 
He was there when we left. 
Are we okay there? 
They have a surveillance photo of one of my team members. 
We told them that we didn't think the photo was clear enough to be conclusive evidence. 
That's gonna hold them off for a while. 
I see. 
Thank you, Jack. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
And good luck. 
Thank you, sir. 
All right, mike. 
I'm gonna need you to advise the President that Cheng has to leave CTU now. 
President Logan was clear that he wanted Cheng to have access there. 
And he has. 
But now Cheng is slowing them down. 
He's got to go. 
CTU needs to be able to do their job without the added pressure of a cover-up. 
You think you can get President Logan to sign off on that? 
I'll see what I can do. 
Yes. 
No, not now, Keith. 
I have too many things to deal with first. 
Yes, you do that. 
Thank you. 
What is it, mike? 
Mr. President, the Chinese 
security officer, Cheng, is still at CTU, and he seems to be slowing things down. 
Well, he wouldn't be there at all if Palmer hadn't authorized an attack on his consulate. 
It's too late to change that now, sir. 
Yes. 
Yes, it is. 
If we order Cheng to leave CTU now, it'll look like we've got something to hide, and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the justification they need to escalate this crisis. 
Mr. President, if we don't find 
that warhead before it's deployed, ten million americans could face annihilation. 
And we could be at war with a Billion Chinese. 
My advice, sir, is to worry about the americans now and the Chinese later. 
Your advice or David Palmer's advice? 
Both of ours. 
When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in, it wasn't so the two of you could form an alliance against me. 
Sir, that's not what's happening. 
No? 
Why don't you tell me what's happening. 
You and David Palmer are running this country while I'm taking phone calls from mid-level staffers. 
Would you like me to ask President Palmer to leave? 
No. 
Call CTU, tell Bill Buchanan to escort Mr. Cheng out of the building. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Curtis, put Michaels in play now. 
Chloe, this is Jack. 
We're at the perimeter outside the factory. 
Our men are getting into position. 
Can you confirm that Marwan's inside? 
I can't say for sure, but I'm detecting a microwave uplink to the building. 
Can you intercept it? 
No. 
It's got encryption. 
Okay, thanks. 
Are we ready? 
Yeah. 
How are we gonna confirm Marwan's inside there? 
We don'T. 
We're out of time. 
We move now. 
Give all teams a go. 
All right. 
All teams, it's a go. 
So you know, Mr. Buchanan, 
this matter will be pursued. 
I will return with a formal order for a more extensive investigation. 
I understand. 
In the meantime, if I were you, I'd focus my attention on the people's freedom coalition. 
I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators. 
We'll do everything we can to help you. 
Sir. 
Excuse me. 
Jack's team is at the staging area outside the building. 
I'll be right there. 
Mr. Cheng, excuse me, please. 
I have to get back. 
My men will escort you from the building. 
Thank you. 
Edgar. 
Excuse me. 
Edgar Stiles, communication analyst, right? 
Yeah. I'm busy. 
I forgot to ask Mr. Buchanan one last thing. 
Maybe you could help me. 
I can't help you. 
You should ask him. 
It's not classified. 
Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you were helping her earlier with some DOD files. 
Yeah, until she was called down to the clinic. 
So it was just you and Jack? 
What? 
Edgar, come here. 
I have to go. 
Bye. 
Thank you. 
You idiot. 
What? 
Just keep your mouth shut. 
I didn't say anything. 
The man who led the attack on our consulate was Jack Bauer. 
Pull up all his files. 
I want to look at them when I get back. 
Michael, are you in position? 
Roger that. 
He's at your two o'clock- take him out. 
Copy that. 
We're ready. 
Start the sequence. 
We're done here. 
Get the car. 
He's cornered in this room. 
Counter-flank and push him back to me. 
Copy that. 
Freeze. 
I've been waiting for this. 
You're too late. 
That hurts, doesn't it? 
Jack. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
We still need him. 
Go ahead, kill me. 
That won't stop the missile. 
What are you talking about? 
What are you talking about! 
Jack, we got a problem. 
Come here a second and look at this. 
Secure the prisoner. 
Oh, my god, they've got a missile. 
Have you got your comm unit? 
Patch it through to the computer. 
Tony, it's Jack. Can you hear me? 
Yeah, Jack. 
What's going on? 
I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead. 
It's been mounted on a missile. 
A missile? 
How can that be? 
I don't know. 
We're trying to get the feed over to you now. 
Hold on. 
Have you got it? 
Yeah. 
How much time have we got? 
52 seconds. 
Tony, can you see this? 
Yeah. 
Can you get a source of the transmission? 
Hang on a second. 
No, Jack- it's on an encrypted uplink. 
There's no way to trace it. 
Do a geography scan- see if you can pull a location. 
Chloe, are there any identifying specifics on the visual? 
Looks like a forest area, trees, a structure. 
Tony, we're out of time. 
We're trYing, Jack, but we can't I.D. 
The location it's too general. 
See if you can pick up a heat signature from the point of Ignition. 
We'll try it, but it's a wide radius. 
There're not gonna be enough time to stop it launched. 
Chloe, do you have anything. 
I'm trying the four band satellite, but it's not working, either. 
 Excuse me, Ms. Driscoll? 
 What is it, Chloe? 
There was intelligence indicating the possibily of an attack at 8:00 this morning. 
A Turkish national on the FBI watch list by the name of Tomas Sherek was last seen in the city. 
 It's Tomas. 
 Did Dar get the briefcase? 
Yes, he's on his way to you now. 
So far, everything is on schedule. 
The briefcase is on its way to us now. 
When it gets here, we'll take it to the warehouse. 
What we will accomplish today will change the world. 
We're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this. 
I found something on the Net I think you should know about. 
What? 
I think someone's positioning code for a major Internet attack. 
The thing is that not all the code remarks were in English. 
 What language were they in? 
 Arabic or Turkish, maybe. 
What did you find on the Internet?! 
It was my friend, not me! 
 What's his name? 
 Andrew Paige. 
Is it going to be uncomfortable? 
What? 
Going back to CTU, seeing Driscoll again. 
I don't blame her for her decision. 
She forced you out of CTU. 
I could have joined other agencies if I still wanted to do fieldwork, but I didn't. 
I know this guy. 
Fortunately for you, Jack, it's our problem, not yours. 
Erin, listen to me- this doesn't make sense. 
You wouldn't risk exposing yourself here in the United States for a train bombing. 
It's not big enough. 
We'll take that into consideration when we interrogate him. 
I am not messing with you. 
You're going to tell me. What is happening at 8:00! 
Jack! 
What is your primary objective?! 
Secretary of Defense! 
Heller. 
Did it ever occur to you that these people are using you? 
Don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason: because you are my son! 
Audrey, it's Jack. 
 Are you still at Richard's? 
 Yeah. 
You need to get your father out of there now. 
Your father is the real target. 
Oh, my God. 
Jack! 
Audrey? 
Audrey?! 
The following takes place between 8:00 A.M. AND 9:00 A.M. 
Richard Heller? 
They took my father and my sister. 
I don't care. It's been over five minutes. 
You need to widen your perimeter. 
You're not listening to me. I'm not interested in local law enforcement. 
I want Secret Service swarming that area now. 
Good. Get back to me. 
Everyone... 
everyone, please listen up. 
Secretary of Defense Heller was abducted a few minutes ago, along with his senior policy analyst Audrey Raines. 
Heller was at his son Richard's house when he was taken. 
LAPD is bringing Richard in for questioning. 
This is a top-priority situation. 
I want all inter-agency protocols activated immediately. 
Move off that page. 
You have to link up to the Secret Service Channel. 
It's not that simple. We're locked out for a few minutes. 
Why? 
They're sequestering the rest of the Cabinet. 
Driscoll's not going to want to hear that. 
She wants us to activate these protocols. 
What do you want me to do? 
I want you to break through those channels. Hack in if you have to. 
Chloe, I need you to move everything from the train bombing to the secondary server. 
 I did that already. 
 Good. 
 I did that, too. 
 What haven't you done? 
I haven't opened a pipe to the Army Criminal Investigation Division yet. 
 Do it. 
 I'm on my way to. 
Yeah, I'm looking at it. They've widened the perimeter. 
Do you have an I.D. on any possible transportation? 
I'm working on it. The only problem we have... 
I'm going to have to get back to you. 
Erin, I need to speak to you. 
You're done here, Jack. 
 Just listen to me. 
 I'm detaining you... 
Erin, just listen to me! 
Secretary Heller is my responsibility. 
Now, I need you to reinstate me on a provisional basis until I get him back. 
You don't give me orders, Jack. 
I'm detaining you until an investigator from Division can take your statement. 
I'm going to recommend that you be arrested for torturing a suspect and rendering him useless for questioning. 
You weren't getting anywhere with him. 
Because of me, Sherek told you everything he knows. 
You'd better hope so. 
Would you please escort Mr. Bauer to a vacant office until Division gets here? 
I'm fine. 
You're making a mistake. 
 Excuse me. 
 What? 
 President Keeler. 
 What about him? 
 He wants to talk to you. 
 All right. 
 This is Erin Driscoll. 
 Please hold for the President. 
What can you tell me about the attack on the Secretary? 
We know that he was taken along with his daughter, approximately ten minutes ago. 
But you haven't had any contact yet from the kidnappers? 
No, sir, we have not. 
How is it the Secret Service wasn't able to protect him? 
It's my understanding that he broke his schedule to visit his son. 
Somehow the kidnappers had access to that information. 
We're loing into that now. 
All right. 
We're gonna go to an elevated level of security. 
I want you to take the appropriate measures. 
I understand. 
Get them back, Erin. 
We're doing everything we can, sir. 
Hello. 
 Mom? 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 I didn't expect to hear... 
 Mom, listen to me. 
You got to get out of the house right now. 
What are you talking about? 
Someone's looking for me, and they might come for you next. 
What kind of trouble are you in? 
I don't know. 
I found something on the Internet. Now these people are after me. 
Andrew, you are being paranoid. 
Mom, they killed Melanie. They killed everybody in the office. 
 What?! 
 They shot 'em. 
 Mom, I'm really scared. 
 My God. 
I'm going to call the police. 
Just get out of there! 
Get to one of your friends' houses and stay there! Go! Go now! 
Andrew?! 
I told them Driscoll wanted me to question you. 
What's going on, Chloe? What are you doing? 
I'll probably get in trouble for coming to you with this, but I don't care. 
I may have a way to find Heller. 
I'm being detained. Why are you telling me? 
Because I don't think Driscoll's handling this the right way, and I don't trust her. I trust you. 
Sit down. 
A good friend of mine called about 40 minutes ago. 
This is someone I went to school with. 
I know him. He wouldn't have come to me unless it was something serious. 
What is it? 
He noticed somdangerous computer code was planted on the Internet this morning. 
How is that connected to Heller? 
Because it originated in Turkey just like everything else that happened today. 
Sherek, the train bombing. 
Where's your friend now? 
LAPD has cordoned off the area, and you can see them taking Secretary Heller's son away from the scene now. 
That's being done for his own protection, according to a police sources. 
Those same sources tell us that at least five Secret Service agents were shot and killed in the kidnapping. 
There is also a belief tonight that the Secretary's daughter... 
 Hello? 
 Andrew, it's me. 
What did you do, Chloe? Who did you tell? 
What do you mean? 
Everyone's dead! 
They're dead! 
Now they're trying to kill me! 
Andrew, talk to me. Who's dead? What happened? 
Everyone's dead! They're dead. 
After I called you, I went back to my office. 
There was a guy there torturing Melanie. 
He wanted to know who hacked into their system. 
And then he shot her! 
God... 
Who shot her? 
Who's this? 
My name is Jack Bauer. I work for Secretary of Defense Heller. 
Andrew, we need your help. 
What?! 
Secretary Heller was kidnapped less than half an hour ago. 
I believe the same people that kidnapped him are the ones that are chasing you now. 
But I don't know anything! 
Son, you've been targeted for a reason. 
You know more than you think. 
What... What do I do? 
Where are you? 
I'm at Union Station. I'm getting out of town. 
No, you stay put. 
The best thing you can do right now is let me bring you in. 
Chloe, what should I do? 
You can trust Jack. 
Okay. 
I'll be next to track three, at the bottom of the ramp. 
Andrew, what are you wearing? 
Uh, bluejeans, brown, brown jacket and a, and a black bag. 
Okay, you stay put. I'll be there in about 
30 minutes. 
Okay. 
This is all my fault. 
I shouldn't have let Driscoll talk me into handing it over to the FBI. 
She did what? 
She told me to give it to the FBI. 
Yes. 
I found the person who stumbled onto our server. 
Is he with you now? 
No. I'll have him shortly. 
Find out who he's talked to. 
Of course. 
And then kill him. 
Yes. 
 Is everything in there? 
 Yes. 
Where's Behrooz? 
Upstairs, checking traffic on-line. 
It's almost time for him to go. 
Are you sure you don't want me to take the briefcase to Omar? 
The plan is in place. 
I don't want to deviate. 
Why? 
This is the key to everything we're doing today. 
It's a lot to entrust to a teenager. 
I told you... 
our whereabouts have to be accounted for today. 
Besides, it's because he's a teenager that he won't arouse suspicion. 
You're right. 
Don't worry, Dina. 
We've prepared well for today. 
The train, the kidnapping, it's all gone as expected. 
I spoke with Omar. 
He's happy. 
And he knows Behrooz is the one who will deliver the device? 
Yes, he knows. 
Behrooz will be fine. 
Okay, people, we're looking to find a connection between the train bombing in Santa Clarita and Heller's abduction. 
Sarah? 
NTSB has given us a full passenger list. 
We're processing those names now. 
What about Heller's son? 
Is it possible he had something to do with this? 
We're not counting anything out at this point. 
He's being brought in here for questioning now. 
Erin, I need to speak with you privately, please? 
 You're testing me, Jack? 
 Erin, please. 
Curtis will hand out assignment protocols to each department. 
I want status reports every 15 minutes. 
I have information that you ignored that appears to be connected not only to the bombing but the kidnapping of Secretary Heller. 
What information? 
A computer programmer by the name of Andrew Paige accidentally came across a possible Internet strike earlier this morning. 
I know. It was passed on to the FBI. 
Yes, against CTU protocol. 
You abandoned an active investigation by a CTU agent during a terrorist strike. 
I just got confirmation from the LAPD that Andrew Paige's co-workers were all found dead less than 20 minutes ago. 
I'll coordinate with FBI and we'll take over the investigation of that lead. 
No, you won't. 
I just talked to the kid. I'm the only one who knows where he is. 
You want that kid picked up, you're gonna have to reinstate me. 
I'm having you locked up for impeding my investigation. 
You do that and I'll tell the president that you had Sherek in custody over a half an hour before Secretary Heller was even kidnapped, and that you couldn't break him. 
I did. 
You threatening me, Jack? 
I am asking you to let me help rescue Secretary Heller. 
This is how it's gonna work. 
I'll reinstate your commission on a temporary basis until Heller is safe. 
You will not make any unilateral decisions. 
You will work as an auxiliary agent under the authority of Ronnie Lobell and then I'll hand you over to Division. 
What are they going to do to us? 
I don't know, but if they wanted me dead, they would have killed me at Richard's house. 
Richard. My God. 
He was still in the house. I don't think they went in there. 
Listen to me, Audie, no matter what happens to me, they have no reason to hurt you. 
They don't need a reason. 
And I don't want you to give 'em one. 
Do what they say. 
Whatever happens to me, don't provoke them. 
If they threaten me, if they hurt me... 
even if they kill me do what they say. 
I only asked for Heller. 
I didn't want to kill her without your permission. 
 Daddy! No! Dad! 
 Leave her alone! 
Don't you touch her! 
So help me, God I will kill you myself. 
Dad! No! 
Son of a bitch! 
Come on! 
Yes or no? 
Do not do this! 
Leave her alone! 
Not yet. 
We may be able to use her. 
Take them away. 
Dad. Dad. 
I'm going with Ronnie over to the train station to pick up Andrew now. 
Has Driscoll cleared you for fieldwork? 
 Yeah. 
 That's unlike her. 
I hope you didn't tell her I gave you the information. 
I'm not in the mood for a confrontation. 
I didn't. 
Have we heard anything from any of the Secret Service agents that survived the kidnapping? 
There's only one so far- he's in surgery. 
Any other witnesses? 
The son Richard. They're bringing him in now. 
Okay. Get back to me as soon as you've got anything on Secretary Heller or Audrey. 
Sure. Bad luck about Audrey being there when her dad got kidnapped. 
Yeah. 
I'm going to my car to get my things. 
Okay, so let me understand this. 
Bauer illegally shoots a suspect and now you're going to let him back in the field. 
He'll only give us the location if I let him work it. 
He can't hold back information, Erin. It's not his privilege. 
We don't have time to interrogate him. 
It's a simple job, Ronnie. 
You pick up the subject and you bring him in. 
Bauer has not been in the field for a year and a half, okay? 
That has consequences. It's my ass that's... 
Which is why I need you to keep him on a tight leash. 
It's not optional- it's an order. 
Fine. 
I'm ready to go. 
This is a simple task, Behrooz, but these are the ones where mistakes can be made. 
Drive carefully. 
If there is anyone in the area who looks suspicious, drive away and call us. 
Understood? 
Yes. 
Hello. 
Mrs. Araz, this is Debbie. 
Yes, Debbie, what can I do for you? 
Can I please talk to Behrooz? 
Let me see if he's here. Hold on. 
 What does she want? 
 I don't know. 
Debbie? 
I've left like ten messages on your cell phone. 
Why haven't you called me back? 
I'm sorry. I've been busy. 
Doing what? 
Working for my father. 
I don't believe you. 
Look, Behrooz, if you're seeing someone else, at least have the decency to tell me. 
I'm not seeing anyone else. 
Then why are you avoiding me? 
I'm not. 
Look, Debbie, this isn't the right time to do this. 
See? That's what I'm talking about. Now, you're still avoing me. 
I'm not. 
Then why can't we talk now? 
Because I can't. 
I've gotta go. 
Behrooz! 
Behrooz. 
That's not the right way to deal with this situation. 
This girl needs to know it's over and that there will be no more phone calls. 
I'll take care of it later, Mom. 
I don't want to be late getting this to Omar. 
You sent Jack Bauer out in the field? 
He'll be with Ronnie. 
Yeah, but why? 
He knows our procedures, and he may have information about Heller that'll be useful. 
What is it, Chloe? 
Curtis, you wanted me to tell you when Richard Heller had arrived. 
He's on his way to Holding. 
All right, thanks. 
Do you want me to choreograph the jurisdictions? 
No, I'll do it. Find out what the son knows. 
Chloe, I'd like to talk to you. 
Has it occurred to you that we might be farther along if you trusted me half as much as you trust Jack Bauer? 
You know what, Ms. Driscoll? 
I'm really not in the mood to play the part of the scared student in the principal's office. 
I came to you with important information that my friend Andrew gave to me, and you chose to not respond to it. 
When you came to me with the original information, we were looking for Sherek, were we not? 
Yes. 
He was our most important lead at the time, wasn't he? 
I guess. 
Then my question to you is, once we had Sherek in custody, if you felt that your Internet lead was still valuable, why didn't you reprise it? 
You're right. I felt more comfortable going to Jack. 
Well, at least that's honest. 
You can go back to work now. 
Check that, please. 
For the record, Jack, I think Driscoll made a mistake by letting you come along. 
All right. 
And just so we're clear, I give the orders. 
I'm fine with that. 
Look, what happened earlier in Holding with Sherek I had intel that told me I didn't have time to do it any other way. I'm sorry. 
Apology accepted, but if you try to exceed my authority again, I will stop you cold. 
Okay, fine. 
Then talk to Marcy, have her isolate all the death threats Heller's received over the last six months. 
I want phone calls, e-mails, snail mails, everything sent over to CTU for analysis. 
Well, for the time being, I'm working with them. 
Yeah. 
Okay, good. Thanks. 
Has Heller been getting a lot of death threats lately? 
No more than anyone else in the Cabinet. 
So, what's it like working in DC? 
For the most part, we solve problems in theory that'll never come into play. 
You wouldn't be interested. 
Then why do it? 
I've got my reasons. 
Hey, man, I'm just trying to make some conversation. 
I read your file. 
Must've really burned you up when Driscoll fired you. 
She did me a favor. 
I wanted to get my life back. 
I wouldn't have been able to do that if I was still doing fieldwork. 
So, how's the master plan going? Do you have a life yet? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I got a life. 
We'll be fine, Audie. 
We're still on U.S. soil. 
That's not going to help us if this is some sort of suicide mission. 
You said Jack tried to warn you about this, before they grabbed us. 
Yeah, that's right. 
That means he must have a reliable source, which means our chances are good. 
Audie, sit down. 
I am your father. 
Do you trust me? 
 Of course I do. 
 Then listen. 
You cannot allow a negative thought to enter your head now. 
They will find us. We will be rescued. 
 Say it. 
 Please, Dad... 
We will be rescued. Say it, Audie. 
We will be rescued. 
We will be rescued. 
Take off your clothes. 
You first. 
Take off your clothes. 
Go to hell. 
Stop! Please stop it! Dad... 
 Who is it? 
 It's Behrooz. 
Behrooz? 
Good job, Behrooz. 
Debbie, what are you doing here? 
 I followed you. 
 Why? 
Because I didn't believe you. 
I thought you were seeing someone else. 
Look around. Does it look like I'm seeing anybody else? 
Debbie, you shouldn't be here. I'm here doing business for my father. 
He doesn't like me socializing when I'm working for him. 
Okay. 
I get it. 
That doesn't explain why you stopped calling me. 
It's my parents. 
They've got a problem with me seeing someone who's... 
Not Muslim? 
Yeah. 
And that's it? 
 Whatever they say, you do. 
 No. 
Then what's going on between us, Behrooz? 
Do you want to be with me or not? 
 I do, but... 
 But what? 
Debbie, I want to straighten things out, okay? 
But I can't do it now. 
We'll get together later. 
Debbie, please... 
Is everything ready in Richard Heller's holding cell? 
Just about. 
They brought in the equipment and they're starting to hook him up. 
Then let's do it. 
Does Driscoll know you're subjectin the Secretary of Defense's son to a lie detector? 
Yes. 
 Is he a suspect? 
 Not exactly. 
But he's on very poor terms with his father. 
I wouldn't want to rule anything out. 
You want to be in the room on this? 
No. I'll observe through the one-way. 
Okay. 
What are you doing to me? 
What are you doing?! 
We just want to make sure you're telling us the truth. 
Why would I lie to you?! 
My father and sister have just been kidnapped...! 
Please sit back, Richard, or I'll have to sedate you. 
You can't do this to me. 
My father is the Secretary of Defense. 
I understand. 
But according to my information, you were about to unleash personal attacks on your father and the President at a rally at Lockheed today. 
Are you insane? 
This is America. I can say what I want in public. 
How dare you treat me like a criminal. 
No one's treating you like a criminal. 
You want to do something constructive? 
Why don't you go find my father and my sister. 
We intend to. 
Yeah, by treating me like I'm guilty or something! 
Richard... 
right now you're the only witness to your father and your sister's kidnapping. 
We need your help. 
Then why don't you get these things off of me and start talking to me like a normal human being. 
You don't have anything to hide, do you? 
No. 
How's the polygraph? 
100 percent. 
Father. 
How did everything go? 
It went fine. 
Omar said one of his men saw you with someone outside the compound a young woman. 
I was going to tell you. 
Who was it? 
Debbie. 
Where is she now? 
She didn't see anything. 
She saw you outside at the compound. That's enough. 
No... 
We've spent years planning for this, waiting for this day to come. 
Now it's here and you've compromised everything. 
She didn't see anything, I made sure of it. 
We'll see how much she knows. 
Call her and tell her to come here. 
Father, please don't do this, it's not necessary. 
I decide what's necessary, not you. 
What are you going to do to her? 
Since when do you question me? 
How long have we lived in this country preparing for this day? 
How long?! 
Four years. 
Almost five. 
That's how much time can be erased by a simple mistake. 
Call her. Now! 
Yes, sir. 
Tim Felson, MTA. 
Ronnie Lobell, CTU. Head of field ops. 
Where's track three? 
East entrance. If you want, I can have my guys lock it down. 
No, no. Don't want to draw attention to anything yet. 
The platform's just at the end of this hallway. 
 Hello. 
 Andrew, it's me. 
Where are these guys? 
They're outside. They should be there any minute. 
All right. Tell them to hurry up. 
It doesn't work that way. 
Just stay where you are and I'll talk to you when they bring you in. 
Okay. 
Andrew? 
Yeah. Are you Jack Bauer? 
Yes. Come on, let's go. 
Where are we going? 
I'll explain later. It's not safe here. 
Let's go. 
Just around the corner. 
You sure he said the bottom of the ramp? 
Yeah. 
 Hello. 
 Andrew. 
 Who's this? 
 It's Jack Bauer. Where are you? 
Andrew? 
I can't really, uh... talk. 
Let's go. 
Andrew? Andrew?! 
Son of a bitch, they got to him before we did. 
How did they know where he was going to be? 
I don't know! 
Who are you? 
I'm the man that's going to kill you if you don't follow my instructions. 
Felson, come on. 
Alert your MTA's. 
Tell them we've got a Caucasian male, early 20s, wearing a brown jacket and carrying a black bag being taken from this station against his will. 
Tell your men not to engage the target. 
I want a visual and a location- that's it. 
Now. 
Where are you taking me? 
This is Marx, I have the target sighted. 
What's your twenty? 
I'm on the train platform. 
Target is on the East periphery. 
Second level parking lot. 
Open the door. 
They're getting in a dark blue Lexus. 
What's the fastest way? 
Straight out the back. 
Tell your man to stay out of sight. 
Marx, stay on the guy, but make sure he doesn't see you. 
Lay down. 
There he is. 
You get the gate, I'll get the kid out of the car. 
Wait. 
Wait for what? 
This isn't the right play. 
What are you talking about? 
If we follow this guy, maybe he'll lead us to Heller. 
Or maybe he won't, but you know he'll kill the kid, Jack. 
Right now, this hostile's our best chance to find Secretary Heller. 
We'll break him back at CTU. 
You don't know if you can break him in time. 
This is not a field ops call, Jack. 
 We need authorization. 
 No. 
I can't take the chance of Driscoll resisting me. 
I told you not to go against me, Jack. 
Ronnie, please... 
You get up, enterlace your hands behind your head. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 Shut up. 
Gate four. He's leaving the parking lot. What do you want me to do? 
This is Agent Lobell. I'm moving in now. 
Let the front car go ahead and lock in the hostile. 
Ronnie. 
Ronnie, where you been hit? 
Can you move? 
Ronnie... 
Give me the keys to the cuffs. 
Please, Ronnie. 
He's our only lead. 
We gotta stop him. 
Come on! 
Damn it. 
Tell me what happened, Richard. 
My father and I were talking, and... 
my sister came in with a phone call for him. 
So he was in the room on the call? 
No. He and Audrey went outside. 
Go on. 
And then I heard an explosion, and I looked out the window and I see them both being grabbed. 
And they didn't come in and get you? 
Excuse me. I know you told me not to interrupt, but we need you on the floor. 
What's going on? 
A webcast signal is being pushed onto servers all over the place. 
A webcast of what? 
Secretary of Defense Heller. 
The terrorists are broadcasting this all over the Internet. 
Call Curtis. 
Curtis, we need you on the floor. 
There you are, you son of a bitch. 
We speak for the men, women and children who've had no voice until now, who've been victimized by the genocidal policies of the United States that James Heller has advanced. 
But the time has come for the victims to demand justice. 
Edgar, isolate Secretary Heller. 
Our soldiers have taken the terrorist James Heller into custody. 
In three hours, Heller will be tried for war crimes against humanity. 
If he is proven guilty, he will be executed in accordance with our laws. 
Because we have nothing to hide, the world will have full access to these proceedings. 
I'm the Secretary of Defense of the United States of America! 
You will listen to me! 
Put down your weapon. 
If another one of my men dies, your daughter will be killed. 
We need to get out of here. 
What? 
You're in danger. 
From who? 
Don't ask questions, just come with me. 
Please, help me! 
( choking ) Debbie, what's wrong? 
( coughing ) What did you do to her? 
( phone rings ) O'Brian. 
The satellite up yet? 
No, I have to reposition without Driscoll noticing. 
Where are you? 
I'm at a Mercury Martin in Solmas. 
I had to stage a robbery to keep the hostile in place. 
Tell those officers to put their guns down and stand back! 
Edgar, I need you to help me. 
Help you with what? 
I've been in contact with Jack Bauer. 
What? 
That's right. 
Now you're involved, so you're either going to help me, or you're going to turn me in. 
You're asking me to do something that can get me fired. 
I know you were working with her behind Driscoll's back. 
What do you want? 
I want to make sure I have your attention whenever I need it. 
Chloe, why are you logged on to an active DOD satellite? 
All right, you're done here. 
I was going to quit anyway. 
I want you to call Jack Bauer now. 
Driscoll wants to talk to you. 
Stand down, Jack. It's over. 
Erin, right now Hasan is free. 
He's looking for a car and a phone. 
Once he has those things, he's going to lead us straight to Secretary Heller, I promise. 
Son of a bitch. 
Get out of the car! 
Do we still have a SAT visual on Kalil Hasan? 
He's west of the 14 on Route 11. 
Average speed, 62 miles per hour. 
All right, I want traffic workups, roadwork schedules. 
We can't let anything delay or prevent him from reaching his destination. 
We need the tactical teams to launch now. 
Keep them at Jack's location. 
I'm coordinating with Division. 
Do you want me to pre-emp that? 
Yes, at one point. 
All right. 
Curtis, I can pull up those tactical teams for you if you want. 
No, you can't. 
That requires a level-three channel. 
You don't have that kind of clearance. 
Miss Driscoll? 
I have a Sergeant Paulson from the Sheriff's Department on line one. 
He says it's important. 
Sergeant Paulson, this is Erin Driscoll at CTU. 
How can I help you? 
Yeah, I have a man named Jack Bauer in custody, He claims he works with you. Is that true? 
Yes, it is. 
He just robbed a convenience store near Route 11 and claims it was part of some undercover operation to delay a suspect until satellite coverage could be established. 
That's also true, Sergeant. 
Well, it might be nice if you communicated with us a little better. 
Well, there were some national security issues involved, and I'm so sorry for any inconvenience. 
May I please speak to Mr. Bauer? 
All right. 
Uncuff him. 
Thank you. 
Tell me that you didn't arrest Hasan. 
No, he's still in the vehicle and we're still tracking him by satellite. 
We intercepted a phone call that indicated he's headed for the site where Secretary Heller's being held. 
You're going to need someone coordinating things on the ground. 
That should be me. 
Erin, listen to me. 
We can get Heller and Audrey out of there, but we need to work together and we need to start that now. 
We have to find Heller before this trial starts. 
It's the right move, Erin. 
He's our only option. 
All right, you're in, but you coordinate through me. 
And, Jack, make this work. 
I will. 
Please advise Sergeant Paulson of the new chain of command. 
Yeah? 
In my capacity as Director of CTU, I'm vesting Jack Bauer with the authority to command and control this part of the ground operation. 
Consider him in charge. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Thank you. 
Sounds like you're the new boss. 
Tell me what you need. 
The vehicle the hostile was driving was stolen. 
I need to make sure there's no APB on it. 
If there is one, I need you to get CHP to cancel it. 
I also left my CTU vehicle over at the convenience mart. 
I'll have it brought right over. 
Thank you. 
Why don't you go get that car? 
Hasan's making another phone call. 
Bring it up, patch it through to Jack. 
( phone rings ) Bauer. 
Jack, it's Edgar Stiles. 
Hasan's making another phone call. 
I'm patching it to you. 
Okay. 
Yes? 
It's Kalil. I'm on my way. 
How much longer? 
About a half an hour. 
The broadcast must begin on time. 
Any problems? 
Nothing I couldn't handle. 
How are you coming with the servers? 
Dumar and Farez are managing, but I'm sure they could use your help. 
I'll be there soon. 
All right. 
Did Heller sign the confession? 
Yes. 
He didn't want to, but we used his daughter. 
Did you kill her? 
Not yet. 
Sergeant Paulson? 
What's the E.T.A. 
on my vehicle? 
Any second, Agent Bauer. 
I'll see you soon. 
I want to hear it again. 
Play it back. 
Okay, Jack, one second. 
Let me play it back. 
Tell your men to stay on channel three. 
Got it. 
Any problems? 
HASAN: Nothing I couldn't handle. 
How are you coming with the servers? 
Dad? 
You did what anyone else would have done in your position. 
I embarrassed my country. 
You signed a piece of paper; all lies. 
Everyone will know that you signed it under duress. 
It's more than a piece of paper. 
This trial is going to be a spectacle, broadcast all over the world, designed to humiliate and degrade this country. 
Dad... 
there's still time. 
There's no sense in deluding ourselves. 
There's less than an hour. 
If we're going to do anything, we have to do it now. 
We've done everything that we can. 
Not quite. 
What do you mean? 
What if I'm not alive? 
They can't put me on trial. 
If I'm dead, their goals go right out the window. 
And they'll be viewed as nothing more than common assassins. 
Dad... 
Listen to me. 
Even if I say what they want me to say, they're not going to let me go. 
They're going to put me in front of a camera, humiliate me, and then they're going to kill me with the whole world watching. 
There are people on the outside looking for us. 
You cannot give up. 
I have to do something while I still can. 
And I need you to help me. 
Help you? 
The chain between your handcuffs, see if you can get it up and around my neck. 
No, no. 
I can't do it myself! 
I don't have any leverage. 
No. 
But you can pull from back there! 
Dad... 
I'm counting on you to help me! 
Stop it! Stop it! 
Stop it! 
At least try it! 
( sobbing ): I won't do it. 
I won't do it, Dad. 
I'm sorry. 
There's a gas pipe. 
If we could break it... 
No. 
Break that, you die, too. 
Do you think that they are going to let me out of here alive? 
Do you? 
They're going to kill me, too. 
Dad... 
Together we can do this. 
We can do it, okay? 
Please. 
Let's try it. 
We're almost there. 
Okay, that's good. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
( grunts ) ( loud grunt ) ( gas hissing ) I love you. 
I love you, too, honey. 
I want a full analysis on both these voices. 
Okay. I'll have it 
done in ten minutes. 
Thank you. 
Edgar. 
What, Maryanne? 
What's a level three channel? 
It's a logon that gets you into all the systems, tactical, district and division. 
I want it. 
What do you mean? 
I want clearance for a level-three channel. 
I can't give it to you. 
Only Driscoll can authorize that. 
I don't care who authorizes it. 
I want it. 
Look, just because you overheard that conversation between Chloe and me, it doesn't mean I'm your bitch. 
( telephone rings ) I'm done being scared of you. 
( phone rings ) Miss Driscoll, it's Maryanne. 
Yes, Maryanne, what is it? 
I've some further information for you regarding Chloe's circumventing your authority. 
I'm listening. 
I don't think she was acting alone. 
Who was she working with? 
I'm not sure, but I found an electronic echo in her call log, and every time she spoke to Jack, there was someone else on the line, too. 
That's an automated behavior on our system. 
Doesn't mean anyone else was on the line. 
Is that the extent of your suspicion? 
Yes, I'm, uh, I'm sorry to have bothered you. 
You're sick. 
You're going to go to Driscoll and you're going to tell her you're overloaded and you need help, and you're going to ask her to issue me a level-three channel clearance. 
Unit Three, this is Bauer, do you copy? 
Copy. 
Back off another 200 yards. 
We can't afford to be spotted here. 
Roger that. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah? 
The marines have assembled and are leaving base. 
Okay, have Chloe collate the satellite images. 
Chloe's in a holding room, Jack. 
She's been suspended. 
We could use her help here. 
Things are under control. 
I'll have Curtis collate the images. 
Erin, Chloe was just doing what I asked her to. 
The point is, she was supposed to be working for me. 
I understand that, but... 
Jack, it's one thing for you to disobey me in the field, but for someone who works for me here at CTU to betray me? 
I can't reactivate her. 
It's a non-starter. 
Anything else? 
No, nothing else. 
We have a situation here. 
I realize that. 
I can do the math as well as anyone. 
The math? 
Protocols were violated. 
Someone has to take the bullet. 
Jack's indispensable right now and I'm not. 
It took a lot of guts for you to do what you did. 
I trusted Jack. 
A lot of people around here trust Jack. 
Doesn't mean they're going to risk their careers for him. 
I have a suggestion. 
I'm going to leave this room, call Admin. 
They'll fax over some resignation papers, and you sign them. 
And then what? 
And then nothing. 
I walk out? 
You walk out. 
No jail, no sanctions? 
That's right. 
Although, if you need a letter of recommendation for your next job, you probably should get it from Jack, not me. 
Right. 
Sound like a plan? 
Yes. 
For God's sake, pull yourself together. 
She didn't know anything. 
You didn't have to kill her. 
Yes, I did, because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself. 
Courage? 
To poison a girl who did no harm to you at all? 
( car door slams ) Your father's home. 
What are you doing? 
She's already dead. 
If your father doesn't see a bullet wound, he'll ask questions. 
Do you want him to know that you tried to help your girlfriend escape? 
Do you want him to know that you failed him again? 
Move away. 
( gunshot ) Take it. 
Behrooz, take it. 
Take it. 
This has to stop, Behrooz. 
You are my son and I love you, but I cannot let you destroy everything, everything we worked so hard to achieve. 
( doorknob rattling ) I know this was difficult for you, but it was necessary. 
He'll dispose of the body tonight after dark. 
Meanwhile, move her car. 
Park it somewhere where it won't be seen. 
Then come straight back here. 
Navi? 
( cell phone ringing ) What? 
You got your level-three channel clearance? 
Yes, I did. 
So we're done, right? 
I mean, I don't think I should have to keep doing things for you. 
What's this about anyway? 
Why do you need a level-three clearance? 
Look, you may be happy tapping away at a keyboard for the rest of your life, but I'm not. 
I have an opportunity here to get ahead, and I intend to use it. 
That's mine. 
I'll be right back. 
I'm more insulted that you thought I wouldn't notice, than by the fact that you were spying on me. 
Driscoll ordered me to do it. 
Next time, do it right. 
Use a Newman filter, so the subject doesn't see red lights flashing everywhere. 
Amateur. 
Bye, Edgar. 
Could you cover for me for just a second? 
Chloe. 
Can you guys give me a moment please? 
I'm really sorry this happened. 
Don't worry, Edgar. 
I didn't use names. 
Driscoll doesn't know you were helping me. 
She doesn't? 
I'm the one who got you into this. 
I'm not going to sell you out. 
Thank you. 
You're a geek, Edgar, but you're a good guy. 
Stay that way. 
I don't really have a choice. 
I guess not. 
Good luck today. 
You're gonna need it. 
Sarah, assuming he continues driving west, what are our potential target areas? 
Well, within the time frame he mentioned, Hasan will reach one of four residential communities and two industrial areas. 
Data-mine those areas. 
See if you can find any suspicious activity in the last six months. 
Citizen complaints, known associates, everything. 
On it. 
Jack, the hostile's stopping at an intersection. 
Okay, I got him. 
( tires squeal ) ( honks horn ) Yo, Mohammed. 
That's your name, right? 
Ain't that what they call all you people? 
I'm just trying to get home. 
It'd be nice if all of ya'll went home. 
Erin, three men have approached Hasan's vehicle. 
Edgar, can you enhance this? Hang on. 
Look, I don't want any trouble. 
Too late, Mohammed! 
( siren wails ) That's him. 
Let's go, man. 
Let's go. 
You three, stay right there. 
JACK: Damn it, the police have got to stay clear of this. 
I ordered a cancellation of the APB on the truck. 
Make sure that that happened. 
It did. 
It may not have gotten out yet to all the local CHP branches. 
If they detain Hasan, this thing is over. 
He'll never lead us back to Heller. 
Put me through to CHP. 
Sarah. 
This is CTU. 
I have a priority call for local dispatch. 
You want to move this vehicle, please? 
Step out of the truck, please, sir? 
What's going on here? 
Just working some things out between him and I, that's all. 
Is that right? 
Yes, sir. 
You three, stand by your car and wait. 
Come on. 
We're going to lose him! 
Get me CHP now! 
Want to tell me what's going on? 
There's really no problem, officer. 
They're just upset about what happened this morning. 
I'm sorry about that, sir. 
Can I go now? 
Just bear with me one minute. 
Why don't you go ahead and call this in? 
Copy that. 
Jack, I have local CHP dispatch. 
Patch them through. 
CHP. This is Officer Dudley. 
Officer, I canceled an APB on a yellow pickup truck, license plate number 4 Los Angeles-Independent-945, Did you get that? 
Yeah, I see it on the system. 
I haven't gotten word of the cancellation here, though. 
One of your officers is questioning the driver of that vehicle. 
It is imperative that that driver not be detained any longer. 
We'll get you on your way as soon as possible. 
Don't let those guys get to you. 
They're just talks. 
I think everybody's been a bit jumpy today with everything going on. 
I appreciate your patience and cooperation. 
( radio squelches ) 6214, copy. 
Roger that. 
We're all clear. 
Have a nice day, sir. 
Thank you, sir. 
ERIN: We're in the clear. 
He's moving. 
He's making another call. 
Pipe it through to Jack. 
Kalil's making another call, Jack. 
( phone rings ) Finish the setup and let's do a test. 
Yes? 
We may have a problem. 
I'm listening. 
The police just ran the plates of the vehicle I'm driving. 
And? 
They let me go. 
Jack, are you getting this? 
Yeah. 
OMAR: So what is the problem? 
This is a stolen car. 
Maybe the owner hasn't reported it yet? 
Or maybe I'm getting help from people who want to make sure I get where I'm going. 
Do not jump to conclusions. 
A police officer was approaching me, his hand on his gun. 
Then he got a call, suddenly there's no problem. 
( sighs ) We can't take any chances. 
I'm moving in. 
He's not going to lead us to the site. 
The best we can do right now is try to take him alive and break him. 
All units, move in. 
I repeat, move in. 
Okay, I've got a visual. 
Set up a roadblock at mile marker 15. 
It has been an honor working with you, Omar. 
The honor has been mine, Kalil. 
Come on. 
Allah Akbar. 
( horn blaring ) No! 
Oh, God. 
He just drove head-on into another vehicle. 
He was our only lead. 
We're going to switch gears since we've lost our only lead. 
Kalil Hasan committed suicide en route to Heller's location. 
Have they recovered anything on him that might help identify where Heller is? 
It's too soon to tell. 
They're still putting out the fire from the crash. 
How much time do we have before this trial begins to broadcast? 
Some time in the next, ten, 15 minutes. 
( phone rings ) Sarah Gavin. 
It's Jack. 
Put him on speaker. 
GAVIN: Go ahead, Jack, you're on speaker. 
I'm sifting through the wreckage now, but there's not much intact. 
Hasan said he was 30 minutes from his destination. 
It's 20 minutes before he stopped. 
Do we have a maximum perimeter? 
Edgar? 
We're looking at a radius of 60 miles centered at Acton. 
We're dispatching choppers and fixed-wing crafts to survey the area. 
No, that's going to take too long. 
Use the satellites. 
Conduct a thermal scan. 
It won't work. 
Why not? 
That area has a high concentration of electric power transmitters. 
The satellite won't be able to distinguish between them and the servers. 
Those transmitters have been in place for years. 
If we take a scan, we can lay it against the previous grid pattern. 
That way we can identify any new thermal activity. 
We can start the scan immediately. 
Do it. 
Jack? 
We're using a satellite to check the thermals. 
Keep the line open. 
Hurry. 
Miss Driscoll? 
The clinic wanted me to tell you that your daughter has arrived. 
Thank you. 
All right, everyone reset your systems. 
Let's get back on track. 
I have to take care of something for a few minutes. 
Would you check in with Division? 
They're expecting an update. 
Everything okay? 
Yeah, just a little problem with my daughter, Maya. 
I had to bring her down to the clinic. 
Is she okay? 
She's fine. 
Call Division. 
What are you working on? 
Personnel allocation tables and tactical generals for the assault teams. 
I notice every time I look over, you're talking to Edgar. 
What's that all about? 
I'm just trying to learn the ropes, Curtis. 
Today is not the day to make career moves on people, Maryanne. 
The only thing you should be thinking about is how to help us stop Heller from being publicly executed. 
Come on, Curtis. 
Give me some credit. 
Save it. 
I know how you think. 
Just leave everybody alone and help us get through today. 
Mark? 
Hmm? 
Thank you so much for helping me out. 
They said Maya's arrived? 
She's in the exam area. 
We're about to do a workup. 
She's been on Thorazine. 
She stopped taking it. 
How long ago? 
Based on what happened this morning, at least a few days. 
What happened? 
She's fixated on one of my neighbor's kids. 
What does she do? 
She walks into the yard, gets verbally abusive. 
I'll take good care of her. 
Thank you. 
Sure. 
Maya? 
Mom, I'm so happy to see you. 
I was going crazy at home. 
What happened with Evan? 
Why did you go over there? 
I know you said not to, but he was throwing things against the fence. 
Maya, he plays with a ball. 
He's seven years old, sweetheart. 
I don't care how old he is. 
He should know better. 
Are you going to talk to his dad about this? 
Come here. 
Look at me. 
Mm-hmm. 
You're not thinking clearly, honey. 
You've got to put it out of your mind. 
Dr. Calis is going 
to help and you're going to feel better very soon. 
Why don't we go home right now? 
We can't, honey. 
Why not? 
There's a little trouble here in L.A. 
and I have to take care of it. 
Are you going to be okay? 
Yes, I'm going to be okay. 
And you're going to be okay. 
I love you so much. 
I love you, too, honey. 
Shh... 
Shh. 
It's okay. It's okay. 
Yes? 
OMAR: Kalil is dead. 
Dead? How? 
He was being followed here. 
He martyred himself without hesitation. 
What about the servers? 
Have they been re-conformed for the broadcast? 
Dumar is doing his best. 
I think we'll be all right. 
If you need help, I can come. 
No, no, no. 
It is too risky. 
If the servers don't work correctly, we're in trouble. 
This trial is only the beginning. 
I know that as well as you, my friend. 
But there's no need to worry. 
Everything will go as planned. 
You checked out the package? 
It's fine. 
I was afraid it might be damaged in the train crash. 
The case is very strong. 
There's no problem. 
Good. 
Then you can get started. 
Gas. 
I smell gas. 
Heller. 
( gas hissing ) Come on! 
Get them out! 
Come on, get them out! Come on, hurry! 
Come on. 
Hurry, open the door! 
Come on! 
Do whatever it takes to revive him! 
( coughing ) I know him. 
She recognized me. 
She has to be killed. 
She will, in good time. 
Go do your job. 
Go. 
Yeah? 
DRISCOLL: We got the results from the thermal scan. 
One site matches the criteria. 
Where? 
An old industrial park around three miles from you. 
Give me the exact address. 
It's off a service road south of Brach. 
Okay, I'll set up the staging area. 
Where is the marine strike force? 20 minutes away. 
This trial starts any minute, Jack. 
I know. I'll get back to you 
soon as I'm on site. 
Meanwhile, have someone download the schematics to the building. 
Send them over to my screen. 
Edgar's on it. 
( knocking ) We'll take the rest of these up later. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
What is it, Robert? 
CTU thinks it's identified the location where the terrorists are holding Secretary Heller and his daughter. 
Where? 
A compound in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
But there is a problem. 
The team's dispatched to the site may not get there in time to prevent the broadcast, and even if they do, there is a good chance the Secretary will be killed in any rescue attempt. 
Well, we have no choice but to hope and pray that you're wrong. 
We do have a choice. 
The Secretary's death would be tragic. 
But his execution on American soil, broadcast to the world, would be far worse. 
It would be a complete and utter humiliation for the country. 
Perhaps the worst in our history. 
I'm well aware of that, Robert. 
But unless you have some solution, I'm missing the point of this conversation. 
The solution is, we make a preemptive strike. 
Assuming we locate the site in time, we destroy it. 
We kill our own Secretary of Defense? 
To prevent our enemies from making a public spectacle of his death. 
He's going to be killed anyway. 
Jim Heller is a good friend. 
A loyal public servant. 
You expect me to kill him to save face? 
Not yours, sir. 
The country's. 
If we look impotent in this situation, we'll only encourage more attacks. 
And if I may say so, sir, having known Jim Heller many years myself, if he were here, he'd be the first to endorse this plan. 
The public will never accept it. 
All the public will know is the Secretary died during the course of a rescue attempt, which is certainly more palatable than letting him be executed with the whole world watching. 
( car door slams ) It's a woman. 
I don't know her. 
Oh, God. 
Who is she? 
It's Debbie's mom. 
Go back. 
Stay there until she leaves. 
What are you going to do? 
Go. 
( knocking ) It's the girl's mother. 
What? 
( knocking ) Mrs. Araz? 
Yes? 
I'm Karen Pendleton, Debbie's mother. 
Oh, good to meet you. 
Call me Dina. 
It's good to meet you. 
My husband and I are very fond of Behrooz. 
He's one of the few boys who seem to know the meaning of please and thank you. 
Oh, I'm looking for Debbie. 
This is my husband Navi. 
This is Debbie's mother. 
Oh, she's a very lovely girl. 
Oh, thank you. 
We just got a call from our dermatologist's office. 
She missed her appointment this morning. Is she here? 
We haven't seen her since yesterday. 
Oh, she left a message saying she was on her way to see Behrooz. There 
must be a misunderstanding. 
Perhaps she stopped off... 
No, she wouldn't have stopped off anywhere, she knew she had this appointment. 
It'll take weeks to reschedule and... 
Is Behrooz here? 
He is studying. 
Well, maybe he knows where she is? 
I doubt it. 
He hasn't left his room all morning. 
School is very important to him. 
( musical cell phone tones ) Oh, that's her phone. 
I know the ring. 
Many, many phones sound alike, Mrs. Pendleton. 
No, she downloaded that ring specially. 
It's one of her favorite songs. 
That's definitely her phone. 
BEHROOZ: Mrs. Pendleton. 
It was my phone. 
Debbie and I downloaded the same ring when we started going out. 
Oh. 
Do you know where she is? 
She said she had a doctor's appointment to go to this morning, and we're going to the movies later. 
I'm sorry about this. 
I'm just worried. 
Well, if you do see her, or if she calls, will you have her call me? 
Oh, yes, of course. 
I told you not to interfere. 
It was her phone. 
I shut it off. 
He took care of it, Navi. 
She went away because she believed him. 
Let's hope so. 
Get in the car. 
Follow her. 
Make sure she doesn't go to the police. 
All right. 
I'm less than two minutes out. 
Have you worked up the rescue approach? 
We're running up scenarios now based on the schematics. 
Okay, what are the probabilities of finding the Secretary and his daughter in the compound? 
Our analysts have looked at everything. 
The data is fuzzy, but our best guess is that they're on the west end of the building. 
Together or separate? 
We don't know that yet. 
Okay, we're going to have to activate a team split, one for the Secretary, one for his daughter. 
We discussed that, Jack, but it was rejected. 
What are you talking about? 
It comes directly from the President. 
Once we go in strong, there'll be very little time to secure the hostages. 
Our only priority is to get Heller. 
Curtis that doesn't make sense. 
I don't like it any more than you do, Jack, but those are the orders. 
Jack? 
They're about to begin the broadcast. 
I'm almost there. 
Damn it. 
We are about to embark on a process of justice, that will forever change the world. 
Our people will finally be liberated from the tangle of corruption that has been choking them for centuries. 
No longer will justice be the propagandist tool of the power elite. 
It will once again become the instrument of the people. 
Delivered through true believers, whose courage to use the sword has made this day not only possible, but inevitable. 
Mr. President, I've 
taken the liberty of having a laser-guided missile programmed and prepped. 
All that remains is for you to give the order. 
...with the same conviction 
and resolve... 
How long between my order and impact? 
The fighter's in the air. 
It needs to get in range, no more than ten minutes. 
...required to render judgment 
fairly, without prejudice, or we will be judged the same as our enemies. 
As our prisoner shall be judged today... 
Do it. 
Let Driscoll know. 
...this nation will 
also be judged. 
Today is the day the United States of America shall be tested for the final time on your own soil, before the eyes of the world. 
Yes, I understand. 
Jack, I have Miss Driscoll for you. 
DRISCOLL: Jack, where are you? 
I'm on site. 
Jack, stand down. 
What are you talking about? 
The marines won't get there on time. 
The President wants to take out the building with a missile strike. 
With the Secretary and his daughter inside? 
Yes. 
Let me speak to the President. 
Jack, I've been trying to get through to him myself. 
I'm sorry. You're going to have 
to clear the area. 
Jack, don't go in there by yourself. 
Jack, talk to me. 
The air strike's already been ordered. 
Jack, clear the area. 
The building is going to be destroyed. 
23.95 
Jack, look out! 
Paul! 
Get me a Medic! 
Medic! 
Losing pressure, I need 10ccs... 
It happened so fast, he was hit before I could do anything How bad is it? 
We don't know. 
We just don't know. 
Please tell me he's not going to Die. 
Why should I help you? 
I'm offering you your Freedom, Dina. 
You and behrooz will be put in the witness protection program. 
You'll be given new Names, identities, everything. 
What do you need me to do? 
I need you to go to fayed and tell him that you need to speak to marwan. 
He won't let me through his front door let alone get near marwan. 
He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him. 
Who? 
Me. 
What If rayed doesn't believe us? 
Then we're both dead. 
Close the door! 
Put your Gun over there. 
Do it! 
What is it? 
A woman named Dina araz came to me. 
What does she want? 
She wants to bring you a hostage. 
A ctu agent name Jack bauer. 
Caused me a lot of trouble, Mr. Bauer. 
kill him. 
just what I thought. 
Dina! 
No! 
Meet them at the hotel. 
I'll need his entire flight package, including clearance and identification codes. 
You'll have whatever you need. 
Get your things. 
We got a plane to catch. 
Let me talk to my family. 
Your family is dead. 
And so are you. 
Edgar, have you found any way to locate Jack? 
We're trying, but marwan wasn't stupid, he covered his tracks. 
Michelle. 
What do we have, Chloe? 
Local pd found the Van that Jack and Dina were in. 
Where? 
It was abandoned at an industrial warehouse at the far end of San Fernando road. 
Dina's body was in it. 
Okay. 
Tell local police to look for witnesses. 
We need a license Plate, something to follow. 
Edgar, pull up satellite from 8:45 to 9:00. 
I'm on it. 
All right, everyone, listen up. 
Jack bauer is missing. 
There's a good chance he's being held by our primary target, Habib marwan. 
Because we believe marwan is preparing for another domestic attack today, we need to Pool all our resources to find him. 
All comm teams coordinate with Edgar. 
Thank you. 
yes? 
There's a problem. 
What? 
I got onto the Base and through both layers of security using the pilot's Id. 
Just as I was about to do a pre-flight check, they grounded the plane. 
Why? 
Checking a trouble sensor. 
Might have to swap out a defective part. 
How long will it take? 
I don't know yet. 
Resolve this now. 
It's time to earn your money, Mr. Anderson. 
Your window of opportunity on the target closes in an hour. 
I understand. 
Excuse me. 
Yes, Sir? 
You working on the Phoenix? 
Yes, Captain, they sent me down from Hawkins. 
You taking her up? 
That's the plan, what's the ETA on getting me in the air? 
Well, trouble sensor was correct, Sir. 
There was a hairline fracture in one of your strut pins. 
But, uh, replacement won't be in till morning. 
is that the only problem, strut pin? 
Well, yes, Sir, but it would be one Hell of problem when you tried to land. 
Rear assembly would disintegrate on Impact. 
Only way out would be to Parachute out and Hope the jet doesn't come down on anyone. 
Did you make your report to the chief mechanical Officer? 
I was just about to head over there right now, Captain. 
And then I'm going to head up to Ventura for a little R&amp;R. 
Sounds great. 
Don't let me hold you up. 
Thank you, Sir. 
Thanks. 
M.E. Says Dina's been dead 
for less than 30 minutes. 
We can only assume that's when marwan grabbed Jack. 
What's the search Range on Jack and marwan? 
1500 Square miles, but it's increasing by the minute. 
What about chatter? 
Well, I filtered through everything that came from Langley, Nsa and interpol. 
None of it's correlating right now. 
And volume? 
It's actually slowing down. 
Which May mean that we've incurred all the damage we will today. 
Or it could be the calm before the Storm. 
Yeah. 
The one thing we know for sure is If Jack's alive, he'll find a way to contact us. 
We'll just have to wait until we pick up a thread on marwan. 
Yeah. 
Tony. 
Yup? 
I heard Jack called you earlier today. 
Yeah. 
And that you saved his life? 
Well, we both know I owed him one, right? 
Look, Audrey's been waiting for her husband to get out of surgery. 
I think we should tell her about Jack. 
Why? 
They're involved. 
She's married. 
Separated. 
Well, then I'd prefer not to tell her anything. 
Why? 
Because we May have to make a very tough call on how Jack's capture plays out. 
Well, Michelle, she's a professional. 
She knows that's a possibility. 
I think it'd be wrong to keep it from her. 
I don't want her interfering. 
I think she has a right to know. 
But, Hey, you're the boss, it's your call. 
excuse me. 
How's Paul doing? 
He's still in surgery. 
I won't know until he gets out. 
Have you heard anything from Jack? 
Jack is missing. 
Missing? 
We think he was taken by Habib marwan. 
My God... 
What are we doing to get him back? 
everything we can. 
How did this happen? 
I thought we were tracking him. 
He's supposed to be protected. 
No one is fully protected in the field. 
Who was in charge of this operation? 
I was. 
Get him back, Michelle. 
I have a few simple questions. 
If you answer them, there's a chance you might survive today. 
Don't waste your time. 
You located me through a man named Joseph fayed, who you might be interested to know has since martyred himself. 
It would help me If I knew he was the only Link you had to me. 
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail. 
Just like everything else you've tried today. 
Fail? 
Almost 40 dead in a Train crash, many more near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant. 
That wasn't really your plan, was it? 
We managed to stop the other 103 power plants from melting down. 
That's what America will remember, that we stopped you. 
No. 
They'll remember the image of Secretary of defense heller held hostage on your own soil,and it will Burn in their psyches. 
This country will forever be afraid to let their leaders appear in public. 
For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well. 
Whatever you throw at us, I promise you, that'll never happen. 
Marwan, we have a problem. 
What is it? 
The family of the pilot that we killed. 
What about them? 
We disposed of the bodies, right? 
Yes, yes, but a relative showed up at the house and became suspicious when no one was home. 
He called the police who are now looking into it. 
Has it gotten to ctu yet? 
No, but this man was a military pilot. 
It will be flagged by other agencies and it will get to ctu within the hour. 
What do you think we should do? 
We have to make sure ctu is too busy to realize its significance. 
Distract them. 
How? 
Tell me about the boy. 
What boy? 
Behrooz araz. 
What do you care about him for? 
Does ctu have him in custody? 
Yes. He's safe. 
You answered the question, but are you telling me the truth? 
Call ctu, ask them yourself. 
Edgar Stiles. 
What's the new password for the Server? 
For the central Server? 
I'll get you on. 
No, don't get me on. Give me the password so I 
can access it whenever I want to. 
It's not your area anymore. 
What are you talking about? 
You work for me. 
No. I worked for you. Worked. 
With an -ed at the end. Past tense. 
Edgar, I've been reinstated. 
So quit being territorial and just give me the password. 
No. 
Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar that I have been re-hired to resume my position as head of comm? 
Things have changed, Chloe. 
Edgar took over for you. 
You'll be working for him now. 
You're kidding. 
Michelle called me in because things were falling apart here under Edgar. 
Now give me my command or I walk. 
You'll have equal authority, just on Paper it has to look like you work for him. 
Well, I'm not going to do that. 
It's a matter of Principle. 
You'll be bumped up to a term four analyst. 
That's a 35% Increase in salary plus bonus. 
Well, I should be getting that anyway. 
That's not my point. 
Edgar works for me. 
Not today, Chloe. 
Fine... 
What's the password to the central Server? 
C-I-s-one-five-a. 
Thanks. 
Curtis! 
A man who says he's Habib marwan is on line one. 
He wants to speak to the director of ctu. 
Put it through a Hi-res filter. 
Activate all tracers and recorders. 
Michelle, someone claiming to be Habib marwan is on the line. 
Are you prepped for the call? 
Yeah. 
Take it there. 
Put him through. 
This is Michelle dessler, director of ctu. 
To whom am I speaking? 
This is Habib marwan. 
Jack bauer is alive and in my custody. 
I'll need to speak to him. 
I will return him to you unharmed in exchange for behrooz araz. 
I will give you ten minutes to secure clearances with your people. 
I need more time before I can agree to that. 
Ten minutes. 
I will call you then with exact details on how the exchange is to proceed. 
Did you get a Trace? 
No. 
Okay, confirm marwan's identity off voice. 
And process behrooz araz. 
got it. 
Why is behrooz araz Worth trading for Jack? 
I don't know. 
Have all tactical teams meet me in the situation room. 
Yeah. 
Sent the report about the pilot and his missing family to ctu yet? 
I don't think so. 
But our contact at lapd said that the report has been flagged. 
It will go out to all the agencies within the next 15 minutes. 
If ctu gets a hold of it, even a minute too soon, they'll be able to stop us. 
You need to tell me the second that report gets released. 
Yes, marwan. 
Marwan wants to exchange Jack bauer for behrooz araz. 
The obvious question is why. 
The way I see it, there are two possibilities. 
One, there's a personal connection. 
Two, behrooz has information that can damage marwan. 
I agree. 
Edgar, have your team sift through everything we have on behrooz araz. 
Go back as far as you can and see If there's a family Link between him and marwan. 
Did the initial interrogation reveal that behrooz knew anything that might make him valuable to marwan? 
No, but main focus was on the mother. 
We really didn't push him very hard. 
Curtis, push harder. 
See what you can find. 
But do it now. 
My guess is marwan will want to make this exchange within the hour. 
Tony, monitor him from the observation room. 
Chloe, what do we have on audio? 
I was able to get some voice memos from mclennan-Forster. 
The voice print matched. 
It was marwan's. 
How are you going to handle this? 
The kid thinks his mother made a deal to protect him. 
The first thing I have to do is let him think that the deal is off. 
We can't use a psychological approach. 
It's too slow. 
What are you suggesting? 
I think he's just going to drag his feet unless we put some physical pressure on him. 
He's just a scared kid. 
I'm pretty sure he's given us everything he knows. 
You're pretty sure? 
I'll call Richards. 
Tony... 
Go ahead... I'll catch up. 
Have you heard anything on Jack? 
Yeah, we just got some information a couple of minutes ago. 
Why didn't you let me know? 
I'm sorry, Audrey, but things are going pretty fast here. 
Look, Jack's alive. 
He is being held by marwan. 
How did you confirm that? 
Marwan contacted us. 
He contacted you? 
Why would he do that? 
He wants to make a trade. 
Jack for behrooz. 
When is that going to happen? 
We don't know If it is. 
What do you mean? 
Look, If he wants to make this trade, that means behrooz has tactical value. 
If that's the case, then we May have to hold on to him. 
Look, there's a lot of stuff we have to go over before anything happens. 
I'll keep you posted, but right now I have to get in that room with behrooz, all right? 
Thank you. 
All right, keep it at that level. 
Let me know If the readings fluctuate. 
Remember, he doesn't know that his mother's dead. 
I know. 
Hello, behrooz. 
How much longer do I have to stay here? 
These things take time. 
Where is my mother? 
She's still in the field. 
With Jack bauer? 
Is she okay? 
Yeah. 
She's fine. 
Tell me about Habib marwan. 
Why are you doing this? 
Habib marwan. 
Your mother gave us a little information. 
She said you could give us some more. 
You promised you wouldn't Hurt me! 
Please, get this Guy away from me. 
Back over here. 
We're just going to have a little talk. 
Marwan's the leader. 
That's all I know. 
I heard my parents talk about him, that's it. 
Go ahead. 
What are you going to do? 
What is he going to do to me? 
sorry, behrooz. 
We just don't have a lot of time. 
No, no, no! 
This is marwan. 
Get me Michelle dessler. 
Miss dessler, it's marwan! 
Everyone, on this! 
This is dessler. 
Union conduit dam,  North entrance. 30 Minutes. 
I need to know Jack bauer's still alive. 
Very well. 
Michelle dessler wants to make sure you're alive. 
I'm being held in an abandoned warehouse, somewhere downtown... 
Satisfied? 
I don't know If I can make this happen in 30 minutes. 
You'll find a way. 
Wait... 
Damn it! 
Ctu will never go through with the exchange. 
I'm expendable. 
Yes. You are. 
If behrooz is a value to you, he's a value to them. 
They'll never let you have him back. 
Marwan. 
The police report file has been distributed. 
In the next few minutes, ctu will be alerted that a military pilot and his family are missing. 
All right. 
Chloe, the hourlies from lapd are here. 
What do you usually do with them? 
I go through them and promote any flagged items to the analysts. 
I can't do that now. 
I have to get ready for the call from marwan. 
Well, I can't do it either. 
I'm working on tracking behrooz. 
But I'd get on those hourlies If I were you. 
Well, you're not me. 
I'll hand it off to Meg, tell her to sift through it, and deal with any flagged items when we're done with the exchange. 
Okay, boss. 
this is Meg. 
Meg, hourlies from local Law enforcement just came in. 
Chloe and I need you to sift through them. 
Do you know how backed up we are down here? 
Yeah, well, it's worse up here. 
Just do it, okay? 
Fine. Send us a four. 
Phoenix is ready to go. 
I thought we were waiting on a part. 
It's a good thing they called me in for a second opinion. 
Aft strut's fine... It was just a 
faulty trouble sensor. 
You sure? 
Absolutely, I triple checked it. 
It was just a false alarm. 
Here is my report. 
All right, I'll clear it for take-off. 
This is Miller. 
Phoenix is clear for take-off all right. 
Chloe, what's wrong? 
Nothing. 
I mean, there's no bad news about Jack yet, If that's what you're asking. 
Since Jack and your father aren't here, you're the Official dod representative, so these are some Standard non-disclosures. 
Read them whenever you get a chance. 
I flagged where you need to sign. 
I'll do that now. 
I'm really sorry about your husband. 
Thank you. 
I can't imagine how I'd be feeling right now If I were you. 
I'm feeling like someone who's afraid of losing her husband. 
No, I meant you know, you and your husband are separated... 
And you've fallen in love with Jack, I guess, and then you end up together, and your husband takes a bullet but saves Jack's life? 
What do you do with that? 
I can't think about that right now, Chloe, okay? 
I just need Paul to pull through this. 
What about Jack? 
You just assume the terrorists aren't going to kill him? 
Chloe, I don't want to talk about it. 
Here. 
I was inappropriately Blunt, wasn't I? 
I do that a lot. 
Sorry. 
Sorry, I'm going to go. 
I have a... A field meeting anyway. 
when you said your father spoke to marwan, was that on the phone or did he come to your house? 
Both. 
Did you ever speak to marwan alone, away from your parents? 
No. 
When they made the preparation for today's attacks, were you in the room? 
I told you. 
They didn't want me in there. 
Almeida. 
Tony, the briefing's about to start. 
All right, I'll be right there. 
If he produces something relevant, let me know. I'll be in the briefing. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, is anything you're doing up there yielding a military connection? 
No. Why? 
It May be nothing, but the county hourly's contain an incident report that might be Worth looking at. 
What is it? 
An air force pilot's wife and kids reported missing as of two hours ago. 
Two hours ago? 
How can someone be missing in two hours? 
I don't know, Chloe. 
I'm just telling you what it says here. 
Should I run it? 
No, we have to do it up here. 
Then why did you send it down here in the first place? 
It was Edgar's executive decision. 
Should I give it to you? 
No, I'm the primary tactical in a trade for Jack. 
Give it to Edgar. 
He said he's too busy. 
Just run it through county and get it to him. 
Okay. 
Edgar What? 
Meg found something in the hourly. 
I need you to look at it. 
Can't Meg do it? 
I'm preparing for this briefing. 
No, it's the job of the lead tactical. 
Isn't that what you think you are? 
I don't need your sarcasm, okay? 
I'll take care of it. 
Fantastic. 
Hey. Is this briefing about the trade for Jack? 
Yeah. Marwan us called again. 
Has a decision been made whether to go through with it or not? 
 No. That's going to be decided in this meeting. 
 By whom Division. 
Look, they sent someone down to run point. 
Is Division thinking about not going through with this exchange? 
Honestly, it could go either way. 
Look, I don't need to tell you that Jack would want us to do what's best for the operation and the country, not what's best for him. 
I know. 
All right. I'll let you know what's going on as soon as I can. 
All right. Thanks, Tony. 
Were you able to get anything out of behrooz? 
I don't think he knows anything but Curtis is still trying. 
Okay. 
Bill, are we up to speed? 
Yeah, I got briefed on the way here. 
All right, everyone, listen up. 
This is Bill Buchanan from Division. 
He'll be overseeing the operation. 
All department heads run everything through him. 
Bill. 
In less than half an hour, Habib marwan wants to make an exchange at the Union conduit dam; behrooz araz for Jack bauer. 
Now, before we decide whether or not to go forward, I need to know a few things. 
Why does marwan want the boy? 
What's his value? 
We were unable to find any evidence that behrooz had any critical information. 
Did you push him? 
Yeah. 
I don't think the kid knows anything. 
Who's doing backgrounds? 
Me. 
There's nothing that specifically ties these two people together. 
The parents, yes, behrooz, no. 
Could behrooz have had something implanted in his body,  something neither he or his parents knew about? 
No. 
We had him scanned when he was brought in. 
Did you do an mri? 
Yeah. 
I don't like giving something up unless I know its value. 
Let's talk about what happens If we don't agree to the exchange. 
We don't get Jack bauer back, for one thing. 
That can't be the deciding Factor here. 
Well, most importantly,  If we don't go through with this exchange, we May be lose an opportunity to trap marwan. 
Marwan has to know that's what we're thinking. 
The chances of him actually being in prison at the exchange are small. 
I agree, but we could put a tracer on behrooz. 
He might lead us to marwan. 
You tried to Trace Dina araz and Jack an hour ago. 
They grabbed Jack and killed Dina. 
We'll take a different approach. 
Use tracers, two of them. 
One for marwan to find, the other subcutaneous. 
There's no guarantee he won't find that one, too. 
No, Sir, there are no guarantees, period. 
But the fact is we have no viable leads on marwan. 
We have to run with every chance we get. 
Have tactical finish up the profiles in five minutes. 
Let's get field teams on their way to the dam now. 
How do you want to approach the site? 
We'll figure that out when marwan calls back with the details of the exchange. 
Go. 
yeah. 
What's your status? 
I should be airborne in 30 minutes. 
Very well. 
Get bauer. 
No, we have to have the satellite in position,  before the exchange takes the place. 
Edgar, Chloe wants you to take a look at this when you have the time. 
Hang on. Let me write that down. 
Just put that down. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, okay, got it. 
Mrs. Raines? 
The doctor wanted me to tell you that your husband should be out of surgery within the next hour. 
How's it going? 
That's all he said. 
Thank you. 
Audrey, any word on Paul? 
We still don't know yet. 
Look, I thought you'd want to know we decided to go ahead with the exchange. 
We're getting behrooz ready right now. 
It's not going to be as simple as that, is it? 
These things are never simple, but, uh,  if marwan really wants the kid, he's got no reason to Hurt Jack. 
And If he doesn't, and it's just a trap? 
We'll be prepared. 
Our field agents will have the area fully covered. 
Tony, will you be there? 
No, I'm going to be running point from here. 
Curtis will be on the ground. 
Is the operational objective to get Jack? 
No, it isn't. 
Audrey... 
We have to consider Jack expendable. 
This whole thing's about creating an exposure point for marwan. 
I know. 
Thank you for being straight with me, Tony. 
Look... 
Jack's about the only friend I have left, so I'm going to do everything  I can to keep him safe, all right? 
Okay. 
What are you doing? 
Where are you taking me? 
Habib marwan offered to exchange one of our operatives for you. 
We accepted that offer. 
What are you talking about? 
What does he want from me? 
We don't know. 
But we'll be behind you every step of the way, and recover you as soon as possible. 
Does my mother know about this? 
Yes. 
You made a deal with her, to put us both in witness protection. 
And we'll do everything to abide by that deal. 
Then don't do this! 
That's not an option. 
Put this watch on. 
No. 
Go away from me. 
These devices will help us track you. 
And I give you my word I'll do everything in my power for you. 
Hang on, behrooz, this will stick. 
it's a Micro tracker implanted under your skin. 
You don't care about me, or your word. 
You're just using me! 
Let's go. 
Edgar, I need you to sterilize a video feed to Curtis's Van. 
Tony, I'm stacked up. 
I got teams that need tactical uploads. 
These hourlies need to be looked at. 
They're 30 minutes past due. 
And now I got to put video together? 
Video's a priority. 
I'll take care of the uploads. 
What about the hourlies? 
Get on it as soon as the Link's in place. 
Is that tracker working? 
The red Dot is the decoy. 
When they find the watch and remove it, we can still Trace the tracker in the back of his neck. 
All right. 
Edgar, make sure all cellular stations in that area are put on auto-Trace. 
Got it. 
When our vehicles get within two miles of the dam on the West, have them hold. 
Nobody goes into that area until we hear from marwan again. 
Castle and his team will be there as soon as possible. 
Behrooz is on his way. 
The tracer's in place. 
We don't have time to send in sweep teams, make sure it's not a trap. 
We don't have a choice. 
CTU, Edgar Stiles. 
This is marwan. 
Get dessler. 
Miss dessler, it's marwan. 
This is dessler. 
I'm going to give you final instructions now. 
Make sure you follow them explicitly. 
Are you ready? 
Go ahead. 
How are you transporting behrooz? 
In one of our tactical vehicles. 
Good. 
Now... 
Approach Via the frontage road. 
Pull up by the back gate of the dam and have behrooz get out by himself and walk toward the gate. 
A Van will be there to pick him up. 
What about Jack bauer? 
He'll be in the Van. 
That doesn't work for me. 
I want to see Jack before I give up behrooz. 
That's acceptable. 
And I want him unharmed. 
Your boy scout is just fine. 
Okay. 
Remember, behrooz gets out by himself. 
If any of your agents interfere, bauer dies. 
Understood. 
Don't be late. 
Our vehicle's five minutes away. 
Then we'll see you in five minutes. 
That should keep them busy. 
What do you want to do about bauer? 
As soon as we have behrooz... 
We kill bauer. 
Who's going to protect me? 
We are. 
That's why we put trackers on you. 
You don't think marwan will find them? 
He will. 
Hopefully, it won't come to that, behrooz. 
What does that mean? 
We're gonna have the area surrounded. 
We will protect you. 
Why would you protect me? 
I'm nothing to you people. 
You think I'm a terrorist. 
I don't believe you are. 
If marwan is going to be there,  why don't you just grab him when we get there? 
He's probably not going to be there. 
We needyou to lead us to him. 
Oh, God. 
It's going to be all right. 
It's not! 
I'm in position. 
Does ctu have anyone there yet? 
No, but Rashid has spotted vehicles at the edge of the access road. 
He thinks that it might be them. 
Okay. 
Wait until the exchange. 
Then I'll give you the word to take out bauer. 
All right Once the trade is made, how much longer do we need to keep ctu distracted? 
Ideally, until we hit the target. 
In any event, as long as possible. 
And what should my men do with behrooz once we have him? 
I haven't decided yet. 
yes. 
They're here. 
Good. 
Send in the Van. 
I don't want to do this. 
Please. I'm afraid. 
I told you, behrooz, we'll be behind you every step of the way. 
What good will that do If he wants me dead? 
He's not going through all of this just so that he can kill you. 
All right, the Van's here. 
Come on. 
All right, I see Jack. 
This might be all we're gonna get. 
We could converge on them now. 
Edgar. 
Is there any indication that marwan has other personnel or vehicles in the area? 
No. Just a Van. 
Marwan's not gonna be there. 
If we close in now, they could take the Van out themselves. 
We proceed. 
Curtis, it's a go. 
All right. 
I'm sending behrooz. 
Go ahead It's all right. 
Go. 
Is my mother in the Van? 
She was working with you. Where is she? 
I don't know. 
I don't want to Die. 
We've got behrooz, and I've got bauer in my sights. 
Take him out. 
I got their sniper. 
Let's move out. 
Why'd you give them the kid? 
It's okay. He's been double-tagged. 
We're tracking him. 
All right, you two, secure the area. 
You two, let's go. 
Almeida. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
I got Buchanan and Michelle here. 
I'm putting you on speaker. 
Okay. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Look, Tony, I need you to pick up a phone matrix within a 20-Mile radius of the dam. 
What are you thinking? 
I managed to short-circuit some phone lines in the building that I was being held. 
Look, If you can find two Service obstructions at the same coordinates, we can get to marwan. 
I'm opening up an interface with the phone company right now. 
Tony, we don't have a lot of time. 
Marwan was at the building when they moved me, but he's not gonna stay there long. 
We have tactical teams ready to go. 
Once we get a location, I'll reposition for an assault. 
Okay, I know the layout. 
I'll run point. 
Copy that. 
The Van's heading West on center. 
Both trackers are registering so far. 
Good. 
Let me know If anything changes. 
Okay, I will. 
Marwan. 
We have the boy. 
I know they will have placed tracking devices on him. 
Find them. 
We're looking for them now. 
When you've destroyed them, report back to me. 
Very well. 
where is my mother? 
Your mother is dead. 
No. 
I don't believe you. 
what are you going to do to me? 
No! No! 
Curtis. 
We lost one of the tags. 
They found the decoy. 
How's the injected device looking? 
Still tracking. 
Wait. 
No, it's not. 
They must have found it. 
Damn it. Can you get me a visual on the Van? 
Hold on. 
yeah, Chloe. 
We need a satellite plugged into the tactical Server. 
Chloe, I got something you should see. 
Okay, I'll get to it. 
Right now we need that satellite to find behrooz araz before they kill him. 
I'm on it. 
We have a location from the phone company. 
I repeat, we have the location where marwan was holding Jack. 
Edgar, download these coordinates to tactical right now. 
Our window is closing. 
we will only have this one opportunity. 
You got to get it into the air right now. 
No problem. 
I am ready and on the move.

Previously On 24 There are five nuclear power plants ready to melt down. 
All I care about right now is making sure that that doesn't happen. 
Your name is on a lease in a building that was used by the terrorists to plan today's attack. 
That makes you a prime suspect. 
I don't know anything about some building in chatsworth. 
I don't believe you. 
Jack... please don'T. 
I-I-I don't know the specific building you're talking about. 
I can find out. 
How?! 
My corporate records are stored on my laptop. 
Yeah, here it is. 
Harris Barnes. 
Interpol back-traced a name and provided a list of foreign nationals who've used it in the past. 
Who used it most recently? 
A man named Habib Marwan. 
Okay, we need to find him. 
I think we already have. 
You okay? 
I overheard a phone conversation between Marwan and one of his men. 
We have less than 15 minutes. 
Have your men secure the floor. 
Curtis and i are going after the override. 
stay down! 
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer. 
I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer. 
Edgar, line one. 
It's Curtis. 
He has the override. 
Is the override logged in? 
Yes. 
Good. 
Send it to channel 11.Hurry up. 
It's starting to respond. 
It's working, Edgar. 
yes!Yes! 
The temperature is dropping on all remaining power plants. 
Miss driscoll? 
It's about your daughter maya. 
You'd better get down to the clinic right away. 
Maya? 
Oh! 
Oh... oh, baby... oh... oh... 
The following takes place between 6:00 p. m. and 7:00 p. m. 
Curtis, I've got some new intel. 
What is it? 
We found out that the man you're looking for, Habib Marwan, works for McLennen-Forster. 
Look, they're the ones that made the override. 
How's that possible? 
He's working under the alias, Harris Barnes. 
They had no reason to suspect him because his clearance has checked out. 
He must have positioned himself inside the company so we can use their technology. 
Call McLennen-Forster. 
Tell them to freeze Marwan's personal files. 
I did. 
You want me to send the com team over? 
No. 
We're closer. 
Jack and I will go. 
Okay. 
Okay, we know Marwan was in the building within the last 15 minutes. 
I want two tight perimeters set up here... roadblocks in every direction. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Jack, I just got off with CTU. 
Turns out this guy Marwan was working for McLennen-Forster under the alias Harris Barnes. 
I told CTU we'd check it out. 
Okay, I'll check it out. 
I want you to take paul and Audrey back to CTU. 
I'll be reachable on my cell. 
Cassell stays in charge here. 
This guy's still in the area. 
Our teams will pick him up. 
Curtis is gonna take you both back to CTU. 
What about you? 
I have to go to McLennen-Forster. 
Why that? 
Turns out the man we're looking for works there. 
Need to get into their computer system? 
Yeah. 
Okay, I'll go with you. 
Why? 
My company sold them their it system. 
I used to be a systems analyst. 
I designed their databases, encoded with military security. 
Mclennen-forster has personnel on board. 
They're going to help us get into his files. 
Yeah, well, I can get you in backdoors those people don't even know about. 
All right. 
You go with me. 
Audrey, I want you to stay with Curtis. 
I'll be on my cell. 
Let's go. 
Stop. 
Good-bye, baby girl. 
Okay. 
I'll let everyone here know. 
Yeah, thanks. 
Let everyone know what? 
Driscoll's daughter committed suicide in our clinic. 
Committed suicide. 
How did she do that? 
She slit her wrist. 
Doesn't make any sense. 
She was being watched. 
I don't know, Edgar. 
I wasn't there! 
I was just thinking out loud. 
You don't have to be so hostile. 
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. 
Where's driscoll? 
The president is about to come on. 
Something terrible just happened, sir. 
What's that? 
Ms. Driscoll's daughter maya committed 
suicide in our clinic about 15 minutes ago. 
Erin... Sarah just told me. 
I am so sorry. 
Thank you, sir. 
Go back to the floor, Sarah. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Erin, you do not need to be here. 
Where should I be, sir? 
We're still in crisis mode. 
Habib Marwan is still out there and we have no idea how many other cells he might be trying to activate. 
For god's sake, Erin... 
our systems are in a transition state that require my constant attention. 
I'm not in denial about my daughter's death, nor am I in shock. 
I can perform my duties until you find a suitable replacement for me. 
Secretary Heller, Ms. Driscoll, 
the president's coming on now. 
Thank you Jim,Erin... 
first I want to express my deep gratitude for what you've accomplished so far today. 
Wrestling back control of the override has saved thousands of american lives. 
The latest nrc report is that the San Gabriel island meltdown is now under control. 
That's great news, Mr. President. 
But has your staff informed you that we still have a few problems to deal with? 
Yes, and that's why I'm calling. 
I understand the man responsible for today's attack is still at large. 
Yes, sir, he is. 
His name is Habib Marwan. 
He's been a long-term employee of a major defense contractor. 
Yes, I heard, McLennen-Forster. 
This Habib Marwan do you believe that the melting down of the reactors was his endgame or do you think he's planning something else? 
As long as he's still out there, we have to assume it's not over. 
Erin, exactly where are we on apprehending this man? 
All our resources are being deployed to that end right now, Mr. President. 
I'll have more information in a few minutes once I've been briefed by my staff. 
But we know Marwan's in los angeles, and we will find him. 
Using the alias of Harris Barnes, Marwan worked at McLennen-Forster for the last two years as a senior engineer. 
His most recent project there was designing the development of the override. 
Before that? 
Well, here's the timeline we've pieced together. 
He went to graduate school in england, then worked for several years for a company outside of london. 
But it's not clear whether he was radicalized there before that. 
But the one thing we do know is that from the day he arrived in the U.S., 
everything he did was about today. 
What were his other duties at McLennen-Forster? 
We don't know yet. 
We're taking a first pass at his records now. 
I'm looking into the possibility that he may have used McLennen-Forster as a base to recruit his sleeper cells. 
And that brings up another issue. 
At present time, we have over 80% of field personnel looking for Marwan. 
I'm just wondEring if we shouldn't divert part of that manpower trying to root out some of these other cells. 
Erin? 
I'm sorry, tony. What was the question? 
Do you think we should reduce the field load on Marwan? 
How about we take some of our people off Marwan but still keep a floor of 60% looking for him? 
Would that work? 
Yes... that would work. 
Okay. 
Edgar, I want you to relocate personnel. 
Based on what? 
Keep the people who've come in the last six hours working on Marwan. 
I want the most alert people focused on him. 
Are we going to ignore what just happened here? 
What do you mean? 
She's talking about Erin driscoll. 
She can't focus. 
She shouldn't be running this place. 
Her daughter died a few minutes ago. 
Give her a little more time. 
More time? 
Edgar, since when do we have the luxury of time? 
She's not stupid, Sally. 
She knows what's at stake here. 
You're right, Sarah. 
We don't have the luxury of time. 
We have work to do. Now, work does not 
include deciding Erin driscoll's fate. 
I think we have to tell Secretary Heller. 
No, we don'T. Not yet. 
Now let's get back on it. 
Hey, it's me. 
Where are you? 
Curtis and I just arrived at CTU. 
Listen, I want you to get the security detail and go back to the hotel and just some rest. 
Jack, I can't leave. 
Not now. 
My father still needs my help. 
Are you at McLennen-Forster yet? 
Almost. 
Jack, can you make me a promise? 
What? 
Take care of Paul. 
He's not like you. 
Please, Jack, promise me that you will look after him. 
Yeah, I will. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later. 
All right, bye. 
Look, uh... 
I don't resent you. 
Well, uh... 
you didn't steal my wife- we were separated and it's fair but I'm not gonna let you take her from me. 
I don't think that's really up to you. 
Or me. 
No, maybe it isn'T. 
But... she... still has feelings for me. 
I can hear it in her voice. 
And I'm gonna fight to keep those feelings alive. 
Well, you're gonna have to do what you gotta do. 
None of field agents at the rocklyn building have been able to pick up a threat on Marwan. 
It's starting to look like he might've escaped. 
So I think we have to assume that the first thing he's going to try to do is activate some of these sleeper cells. 
I agree. 
He'll most likely launch a strike right away, create fear that we're still vulnerable. 
You'll have to excuse me, I'm not feeling very well. 
Erin. 
Sit down. 
You all right? 
get me medical up here right away. 
Erin Driscoll needs assistance. 
No, I'm fine. I don't need anybody. 
I just... got a little 
light-headed for a second there. 
No, I don't need you here. 
It's all right. I was dizzy, 
but I... I feel better. 
Well, take a break, get something to eat. 
Take Ms. Driscoll down, 
and get her some food. 
I can handle the situation here while you rest. 
Come on. 
All right. 
That's probably a good idea. 
She's going to need to be relieved of duty. 
Contact division, alert them to the situation, and tell them to send someone. 
I ran this office for two years. 
I could take over for Erin on a provisional basis. 
Forget for the moment that you technically don't even work here. 
You've been away quite a while. 
You're not fluent with the new systeMs. 
With all due respect, sir, you don't need a programmer. 
What you need a decision maker who knows how to stack up protocols. 
And you can do that? 
Yes, sir, I can. 
Fine. 
Effective immediately, you're the interim director of CTU los angeles under my authority. 
I still want to contact district, have them send someone on a more permanent basis. 
I understand, sir. 
Sarah, do you have the abstract on McLennen-Forster yet? 
One second. 
I'm finishing it now. 
all right. 
McLennen-forster was a principal contractor in the design of the override. 
and Marwan- under the alias of Harris Barnes...... 
had full security access on that project. 
And you ran fbi checks on the others that were involved in the project? 
Yes, they came up clean. 
So we're dealing with a terrorist who had inside access to a defense contractor. 
ACTUally, more than that, curtis. 
McLennen-forster, in addition to being a weapons manufaCTUrer, trains their clients to use those weapons. 
International clients? 
Yes. 
Several countries in the balkans, asia and the middle east. 
This is a messy situation. 
When Jack gets to McLennen-Forster, he's going to have to get into those company records and find out exactly who Marwan dealt with. 
It's not going to be that easy. 
This reflects on the company. 
They'll be reluctant to give up incriminating information... even if Marwan 
were the only guilty party. 
Mr. McLennen, we need to talk 
seriously before CTU gets here. 
What's the problem? 
It was more than a coincidence that one of our products, the override, was stolen and used in today's terrorist attack. 
What do you mean, more than a coincidence? 
The entire operation everything from Secretary Heller's kidnapping to the meltdown of san gabriel island, was organized by one of our own employees. 
What are you talking about? 
One of our engineers a man who we now know is a terrorist named Habib Marwan was running his own covert organization from within our company. 
When did you find this out? 
A couple minutes ago. 
They called and said that one of our employees, Harris Barnes, was aCTUally Habib Marwan. 
Who else knows about this? 
Just the two of us... and Conlin. 
Gentlemen. 
I'm David Conlin. 
Vp of internal security. 
Jack Bauer, with CTU. 
This is Paul Raines. 
Jack. 
Paul. 
How can I help you? 
I need to speak with your CEO, Gene McLennen. 
Gene's in a meeting with a couple of directors right now. 
He asked me to assist you. 
I've access to everything in the building. 
I'm sorry, but maybe my office didn't make itself clear. 
This is a matter of national security. 
I need to speak with Mr. McLennen now. 
I understand. 
Let me see what I can do. 
What's the matter? 
Something's not right. 
John, I'm not going to keep this a secret. 
We have to let the government know, right away. 
Sir, if you do this... 
it will, with 100% certainty, be the end of this company. 
Now you built McLennen-Forster from scratch. 
Everything you have is tied up in it. 
If this comes out, your name will be synonymous with what happened today- terrorism, treason. 
Well, what do you want me to do, John, lie to the government? 
Look, if I knew 24 hours ago what I know now, I would've done whatever it took to stop today's attack. 
But there's nothing we can do now except protect ourselves and keep this company from going under, which it will do if CTU finds out the truth about Marwan. 
John, CTU will subpoena the file. 
They will find out the truth. 
They won't, Gene. 
I promise you. 
Conlin and I can deal with this, if you let us. 
I don't like the sound of this. 
Mr. McLennen, we implicitly 
violated national security procedure. 
This could mean prison time. 
We've got to protect ourselves. 
Did you get the latest casualty figures in san gabriel island? 
No, not yet. 
Which version of the datalink security system are you currently running? 
Excuse me? 
One of my companies produces... for datalink. 
We installed your system. 
You at 3.4 or 3.5? 
Uh, 3.5 
Will that work for you? 
Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Dave, come on in. 
John Reese, Chief Technology Officer. 
That's right. You helped us identify 
the override earlier. Jack Bauer. 
It's good to meet you in person. 
And I'm Gene McLennen. 
I'm, uh, sorry I was delayed. 
Thank you for your time, sir. 
So how can I help CTU? 
One of your employees, a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device. 
We need you to take your IT systems off-line so Paul can look into his directory. 
We can do that. 
Can't we, John? 
Absolutely. 
Follow me. 
Thank you, sir. 
Certainly. 
Maybe you should go home. 
I'm afraid to. 
When my wife, Susan, died, I didn't deal with it at all. 
Actually, I went to work the next day. 
I remember thinking to myself, "that's life. " 
Quit feeling sorry for yourself. 
Get over it and get on with it. 
A few weeks later, I answered a call from an old friend of Susan's who did not know she had died. 
And when I heard myself saying, "Susan has passed away," when I actually said those words, It hit me. 
All the pain I was trying to shut out just overwhelmed me. 
Erin, you can't keep it inside. 
you cry, you blame god you blame yourself, and then you cry some more. 
And all the while, you let your friends help you. 
It's pretty simple. 
Very painful. 
and I am so, so sorry for you. 
Dad, I just want... 
oh, um, uh, uh, I'm sorry. I... 
I-I just wanted to let you know that I was back. 
I will go home. 
You should go, and make sure your daughter's okay. 
If you need me, I'll be on the floor. 
Excuse me, sir? 
Tony just told me you put him in charge of ctu? 
That's correct. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
He just got reinstated, and I'm second-in-command. 
Tony had Erin's job for two years. 
He has experience running the ctu. 
You don't. 
 With all due respect... 
 relax, Curtis. 
It's provisional, till district finds someone else. 
For the record... I don't like it. 
What do you hear from Bauer? 
He just arrived at McLennen-Forster a few minutes ago. 
He's gonna call on the com if he picks up interference there. 
Okay, that was Marwan's work station in the corner. 
His computer is tied into the engineering sub-net. 
What about the rest of the network? 
Can you get into it from his account? 
Yeah, I think there's a way to do that. 
All right, you've got two windows. 
One shows you his files in the system. 
and the other will get you outside the sub-net. 
All right. 
Let me know if you need anything. 
thanks for your help. 
This guy looks like he knows his way around our system. 
Don't worry. 
I'll be able to control things from here. 
He won't find a thing. 
Marwan purged a lot of files. 
When? 
Deletion dates aren't coming up. 
That means they could have been deleted today. 
Marwan wasn't here today. 
He was in rocklyn for the override. 
Maybe someone else deleted the files. 
There. 
All right, let me see what I can find. 
yeah? 
I had to open up a socket for him. 
I can see it. 
Are they gonna be able to find anything? 
As long as I can see where he's looking and stay ahead of him I should be able to delete the incriminating files. 
All right. I'm coming up. 
What if you can't stay ahead of him? 
What happens then? 
There are other options. 
What other options? 
We'll set off an EMP. 
A pulse bomb? 
Are you out of your mind? 
You'll destroy every piece of hardware we have in this building. 
It'll cripple us electronically. 
That's the point. 
This is the hand-over sequence for com. 
I'll have the default password in place. 
You can reset it as soon as you're done here. 
All right. 
Here are all the access codes to ctu and division. 
Thanks. 
Any of my personal stuff... 
gets in your way, you just have someone box them and put them into storage. 
If you need anything, ask Curtis. 
And if he can't help you, you can always call me at home. 
Thanks. 
Could I have everybody's attention, please? 
By now, you all know that I've taken over Erin Driscoll's command on a purely provisional basis. 
All protocols remain the same. 
But I want updates from all department heads every 15 minutes. 
Other than that I'm just here to support you. 
So, let's get back to work. 
What do you hear from Jack? 
He and Paul Raines are looking through Marwan's files now. 
 Any promising leads? 
 Nothing yet. 
All right. Look, Edgar... 
before Erin left, she told me the one person I should rely on was you. 
She said that? 
Yes, she did. 
So, if anything comes across your desk you think is important. 
I want you to bring it to me directly, all right? 
You got it. 
All right, thanks. 
Edgar? 
Have you scanned all the satellite imagery around the rocklyn building? 
Yeah, everything's into take-down of the override. 
All right. 
I want you to try different frequency channels on that satellite. 
Manually? 
Yeah, that's the only way we can be sure to see it all. 
You're going to have to talk to Tony about that. 
I'm supposed to be backing up Jack and Paul at McLennen-Forster. 
put somebody else on that. 
This is more important. 
What's more important? 
We've got 75% of our people on McLennen-Forster. 
I need Edgar to help me find a trail to Marwan. 
No, we don't have much of a chance of finding anything on Marwan by satellite. 
Our best chance of picking up a thread is through those files at McLennen-Forster. 
Stay on that. 
We can't afford one security-grade analyst going over imagery? 
Yeah, one. 
But not Edgar. 
Put somebody else on it. 
Tony? 
Are we trying to accomplish the same thing here, or is this about you establishing position? 
I don't have to establish position. 
I've already got it. 
Now, what do you say we stop wasting time arm-wrestling here? 
I respect your opinion. 
But we're going to disagree from time to time, and when we do, we're going to do it my way. 
Fine. 
But I suggest you put more manpower into a data search for Marwan. 
All right, grab a couple of people from image processing. 
Work the satellites with them. 
Curtis? 
don't worry. 
I'm gonna be out of here when this crisis is over. 
But in the meantime, I want the same thing you do. 
I want to find Habib Marwan, all right? 
Is everything all right? 
I heard you had a problem. 
CTU got to the override before the other nuclear plants melted down. 
Well, at least you're safe. 
For now. 
But they know who I am. 
They'll be tracking me with everything they've got. 
How does that affect our scheduling? 
It doesn't. 
Stay on task. 
Make sure everything at the air force base is ready when I give the order. 
I checked in with everyone as of ten minutes ago. 
We're gonna make this thing happen, Habib. 
Now, remember... 
when you're done, get in touch with Prodo. 
He'll get you out of the country. 
And you? 
Go. 
good. 
What? 
I can rebuild the files from these empty directories. 
Damn it. 
What's he doing? 
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted. 
How can he do that? 
I don't know. 
It's not a documented function of this system. 
He must be using some hook left into the design. 
They're gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists. 
Not necessarily. 
The pulse bomb... 
we have to use it now. 
research six. 
Set it off. 
 Sir, there was no test scheduled today. 
 This isn't a test. 
Open up the safety chamber and set it off now. 
Yes, sir. 
We set off this EMP, CTU will know we're trying to hide something. 
Well, not necessarily. 
Marwan's their suspect. 
They'll assume he was behind it. 
And what about the damage it'll do to threst of the infrastructure? 
A lot better than destroying the entire company. 
It'll take some time, but we can rebuild. 
yeah? 
The EMP has been activated, sir. 
And the shield door is open. 
Okay, good. 
It's been activated. 
It will take ten minutes to charge up before its release. 
Edgar? 
What? 
The phone TAPS you wanted at McLennen-Forster aren't holding. 
What do you mean not holding? 
The connection keeps drifting. 
I have to reset the patterns. 
Is there a problem on our end? 
Check their power supply. 
It could be their PBX. 
Oh, my god. 
Look at this thing. 
The amplitude's fluctuating like crazy. 
I thought you checked that before you set the TAPS. 
I did. 
It was fine then. 
Let me call Jack. 
That cellular customer is out of range. 
Yes, I need to speak with Jack Bauer. 
He's a CTU agent working in Parris Barnes office. 
hello? 
Hello? 
What's going on? 
That's strange- all of a sudden the land lines around McLennen-Forster are out. 
Can we use the network to message him? 
Yeah, so far the computers haven't been affected. 
All right, open up a window for me, would you? 
what the hell's this? 
I don't know. 
Something's wrong. 
I got to respond. 
Can you pipe that window over to this computer? 
Yeah, just give me an ethernet address. 
6-e-f-f-3-2-3-9. 
Almost got these files rebuilt. 
Sarah, do we have any data points outside that building? 
I'm on line with the phone company now. 
They're getting complaints as far as eight blocks away from the McLennen-Forster building. 
 Have you still got a connection? 
 Yeah, I got it. Look at this. 
son of a bitch,It's encrypted. 
It's got to be it. Print it out, now. 
Now! 
Damn it. 
They've got something. 
What? 
I can't read it- how much longer till this thing goes off? 
Any second now, we should be fine. 
We're not fine. 
He's printing it. 
What are you going to do now? 
Take care of it. 
I don't believe this. 
We're dealing with an EMP. 
Mclennen-forster were leading the way in developing a nonlethal weapon for the military. 
What is it? 
An electromagnetic pulse bomb. 
Once it goes off everything within its radius that has electrical components gets fried. 
Lights, cars, computers. 
Every piece of electronic data just disappears. 
Vanish forever. 
Well, how long have we got? 
I don't know. 
Its capacitors are still charging. 
Come on. 
All right, the printer's warmed up. 
Sarah, do we have any choppers in that area? 
Yeah, one. 
If that chopper's in the air when that EMP goes off it's going to knock out its whole electrical system and that chopper's going down. 
Get him out of the area now. 
Edgar, where's this coming from? 
From McLennen-Forster. 
I'm trying to get a position now. 
CTU 3, do you hear me? 
CTU 3, do you copy? 
All right, this is coming through. 
Okay, they found the EMP. 
I'm going to try and stop it. 
If I don't I want you to take the hard copy, try and meet me in the front of the building. 
Dave, Bauer ran out- he must have found out about the emp. 
Neil, CTU agent's heading down toward you. 
Don't let him anywhere near it. 
Mr. Conlin... 
is everything all right? 
As you can see, we're having some problems with the electricity. 
Jack just went to check it out. 
Saw you were printing something. 
How'd you know that? 
We were searching the system same time you were. 
Trying to help you guys out. 
Mind if I take a look? 
Sure. 
It's, uh, just in the printer. 
yeah? 
Two's clear, I'm moving to three. 
All right. 
oh, my god. 
I've got to stop it. 
you got nowhere to go, man. 
Doors are locked. 
Where's the printout? 
Where is it? 
Come on. 
One of our choppers is down. 
Send medical in now. 
Call all field teams outside the perimeter of the blast. 
We have to find Jack and Paul. 
Sir, we have a problem. 
Someone set off an EMP blast in the McLennen-Forster building. 
We believe Jack and Paul are still inside. 
I assume that's a response to our presence there. 
Someone does not want us to get a hold of Marwan's file. 
Jack was able to pull some information before the blast but we don't know whether it was Marwan or somebody else that set it off. 
Excuse me, sir, Driscoll's replacement's arrived. 
She just passed through security. 
Thank you. 
That was fast. 
We got lucky. 
Division had someone available with the appropriate qualifications and CTU experience. 
I understand. 
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in, and I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler. 
I'm sorry. 
Who? 
Michele Dessler, do you know her? 
I used to be married to her. 
The Chinese are continuing to press the case that we were involved in the assault on their consulate. 
Have they managed to find evidence beyond the surveillance video of me? 
No... and we have to make sure they don't. 
You were part of the covert team that mounted the assault on our consulate. 
If you're not going to tell us who was ultimately responsible, that leaves you. 
If it's Stealth,we can't track it by radar. 
Those missiles travel at a speed of 600 miles an hour, which means it could hit a target on either coast in under three hours. 
That's assuming it's headed for the coast. 
If it's not,it could hit its target at any time. 
What is CTU going to do now to find the missile? 
At this point,CTU no longer has any reasonable expectation of finding the missile before it reaches its target. 
I gave you the responsibility to stop this. 
You failed me,David. 
And you failed your country. 
Drop the gun! 
It's over. -TONY: Do it,Jack. 
Do you really have what it takes to let me kill him while you're looking him in the eye? -Yes. 
JACK: Tony... 
I have the power to give you a deal signed by the President of the United States. 
In exchange,you're going to help me find Marwan and stop this warhead from hitting its target. 
Show me the deal. 
Bill,this is Jack. 
Has the President signed the pardon yet? 
Any minute now. 
I don't like that we're cutting this woman a deal,Jack. 
We can't verify she's telling the truth until it's too late. 
We don't have a choice. 
Right now,she's the only person that can lead us to Marwan, and Marwan's controlling the missile. 
Has the Attorney General reviewed this immunity agreement? 
Yes,sir. 
We should be getting his final approval any minute now. 
PIERCE: Mr. President,I'm sorry to interrupt, 
but there's something you might want to see. 
It may affect the immunity agreement. 
What is it,Aaron? 
The woman you're about to pardon... 
I'm pretty certain you've met her before. 
Explain. 
May I? 
Absolutely. 
On the right is the hostile we have in custody. 
On the left, this is news footage from four-and-a-half years ago in Los Angeles moments before the attempt on your life. 
You're telling me the woman we're about to cut a deal with tried to assassinate me? 
Yes,sir. 
Novick. 
All right. Thank you. 
Mr. President,the Attorney General says 
the immunity agreement is in order, ready to be signed. 
LOGAN: If I read this document right, it grants immunity not only for what this woman has done today, but for any crimes she's ever committed in the past. 
NOVICK: That is correct,sir. 
Sign it. 
We're trying to get you the deal, but we will pull it if the missile hits first. 
I will talk when my representatives confirm my immunity. 
Not before. 
Manning. 
Yeah. 
She's right here. 
I'm listening... 
Is the paperwork in order? 
Good. 
Where is Marwan? 
The Global Center. 
A helicopter is waiting for him on the roof that will be taking him to a ship. 
If he flies low enough,he'll evade radar. 
When is he leaving? 
Now. 
Get the chopper ready. 
Alpha Four,it's Manning. 
She stays here until we verify this. 
Simmons,this is Bernhardt. What's your 20? 
Capturing Marwan alive is our only chance of stopping this warhead from hitting its target. 
We are not to use lethal force even in self-defense. 
Am I clear? 
Got it,Jack Let's go! 
She's not answering her phone. 
She should have been here already. 
She said she was delayed. 
We're not waiting. 
How long before we get to the ship and international waters? 
Ten minutes. 
Something's wrong. 
Edgar,it's Jack. 
We're almost there. 
Have you got confirmation on the target? 
We just repositioned the satellite. 
The images are coming through now. 
There,on top of the Global Center I see a chopper. 
Southeast corner. 
Copy that. 
I want you to take a southeast approach. 
Stay below the building. 
Missile still on target. 
We've got to get out of here. 
Just a few minutes until we're up to speed. 
Okay,come up over the building now! 
Don't let him take off! 
Stay above him! 
Go! Go! 
I can't! He's right on top of me. 
Go! 
PILOT: The engine's out! 
Put me in a position to bail. 
JACK: There he is! 
I got you covered. 
Clear! 
No! 
Tell me where the missile is. 
Tell me where it is. 
Tell me where it is. 
No! 
No! 
I don't understand. Bauer had orders to take Marwan alive. 
I'm sure Jack did whatever he could. 
That's not good enough,David. 
CTU is searching Marwan's helicopter, trying to find something that will help them locate the missile. 
We're out of time. 
Not yet. 
Mr. President... 
I'm sorry to add to an already difficult situation, but the acting Chinese consul,Su Ming,is on teleconference. 
He says it's urgent. 
Put him through. 
Gentlemen... 
as we discussed earlier, our consulate in Los Angeles was attacked three hours ago. 
A Chinese citizen was abducted, and our consul killed. 
We've already given you our assurance that we had no knowledge of this reprehensible attack. 
Which is strange, since one of your agents has confessed his direct involvement and implicated his superior,as well. 
What are you talking about? 
My name is Howard Bern. 
I'm a federal agent with the Counter-Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles, speaking of my own free will,under no duress. 
I participated in an unlawful assault on the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. 
I was acting under the orders of Special Advisor to the Secretary of Defense... 
Jack Bauer. 
SU: Mr. Bern provided details which leave no doubt 
that he is telling the truth. 
The full tape will be forwarded to you immediately. 
Putting aside the question of how this so-called confession was obtained, what does your government expect us to do? 
Mr. Bauer committed a crime at our consulate, 
which is Chinese territory. 
If he was acting without your approval, he should be turned over to our government to be tried and sentenced according to our laws. 
Mr. Su,we'll get back to you. 
Damn it,David,you said this would be handled. 
I'm sure the Chinese don't want war. 
No. But they do want to embarrass us, 
take the moral high ground in the court of world opinion. 
Well,we need to take the least-damaging course of action. 
Unfortunately,then,there's only one option. 
Which is? 
We hand Bauer over to the Chinese. 
Unacceptable. 
Besides,if we turn him over, he'll implicate this administration. 
The Chinese made Bern talk. 
They'll do the same with Bauer,eventually. 
Jack Bauer would never compromise national security. 
As much as I'd like to believe that,everyone breaks. 
What you believe is irrelevant. 
There is another option,Mr. President. 
Go on. 
Suppose something happens to Bauer? 
Suppose he has an accident? 
That's an obscene suggestion. 
It solves a lot of problems. 
PALMER: Mr. President! 
This administration does not condone murder. 
And it never will. 
Is that clear? 
Yes,sir. 
I'm sorry,sir. 
Did you find anything on Marwan's body? 
We're still looking. Are you okay? 
I'll be a lot better once we take this missile down. 
MacALLAN: Sir,we might have found something in here. 
What is it? It's been shot up pretty badly, 
but one of the drive platforms is intact. 
It's some kind of tracking or navigation program with a GPS node. 
Adams is uplinking whatever's left to CTU. 
Okay,thanks. 
Buchanan. 
Bill,it's Jack. Forensics found something. 
They sent it over... Chloe's got it. 
She and Edgar are trying to download the interface. 
How close are they? 
I'll put you on speaker. 
You're on,Jack. 
Chloe,have you got anything on that program? 
Nothing yet. 
Give us a second,Jack. 
It's totally random. I can't make any sense of it. 
Maybe try a correlation matrix. 
What's that going to do? 
Just do it,Edgar. 
I told you it wasn't going to work. 
That's because you didn't expand the parameter. 
See? 
What have you got? 
Two parallel columns, but the data points are badly damaged. 
What do you mean,parallel columns? 
They could be a flight path. 
I'll try plotting them over the USGS map. 
It's working. 
If that's a flight path,it's headed due west,over Nevada. 
It's Los Angeles. 
It's gotta be. It's coming towards Los Angeles. 
Chloe,run a time analysis. 
Assuming the missile travels at 600 miles per hour, it puts it within this 30-mile segment. 
I'll get those coordinates to the Air Force. 
Captain Clarke,Bill Buchanan,CTU. 
The missile's heading for Los Angeles. 
We've narrowed the possible coordinates. 
We're uploading them to you now. 
Okay,thanks. 
They have planes ready in the air now. 
If our projections are correct, they should be able to find it quickly. 
They'd better,since the casualty figures of an L.A. air strike 
would be over a million lives lost, including ours. 
Put the military channel on speaker. 
Delta One,I'm approaching the designated segment. 
Roger that,Delta One. 
Still no joy target. Searching. 
Jack,if the missile gets shot down, could the warhead detonate? 
No,the warhead is specifically designed not to blow up until it hits its designated target. 
But the force of the impact could trigger the arming mechanism,right? 
It's unlikely. 
But it is possible,right,Jack? 
Yes,it's possible,but we don't have a choice; we're out of time here. 
This is Air Control. 
I've got a blip at 40.38 south by 30.16 west. Respond. 
Closing in on those coordinates. 
Possible contact. Breaking left. 
Delta One,I've got tally on the target,12:00. 
I'm arming. 
I'm in range,sir. Request clearance to engage. 
Delta 2,target is confirmed. 
I've got good tone. Fox two. Missile away. 
Splash one. 
That's a direct hit,Delta One. The target is down. 
I repeat,the target is down. 
Here's the report so far. 
No nuclear radiation was emitted when the missile was destroyed. 
Debris hit the ground and,uh... 
there was some damage and several injuries, but no loss of life as far as we know. 
We'll pick this up later. 
When they told me you were dead... 
It's all right. 
Oh,I love you. 
I didn't realize how much until I thought I lost you. 
What is it? 
When that woman called and she told me... 
Hey,listen... you did what you had to do. 
But I didn't do what you did. 
You chose me,and I chose... 
Look,we did the best we could,all right? 
Now it's over. 
No,commercial flights are still grounded. I'm... 
I'm trying to get Paul back on a military transport. 
Yeah,I haven't taken care of his funeral arrangements yet. 
I still need to call his mother. 
Listen,I-I'm gonna,I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
There's something I need to deal with. 
Your father said you're going to Washington tomorrow. 
Yeah,I have to take care of Paul's funeral. 
And after that? 
I'm sorry,I... 
I know this isn't the right time to talk about everything. 
Maybe tomorrow before you catch your flight, we could,we could get together. 
Jack,I don't think that's a good idea. 
I thought we agreed that we... 
wouldn't make those kinds of decisions today. 
I know,but,just... 
Audrey... 
I love you. 
I want to spend the rest of my life with you. 
That's all I want. 
We both know that you belong here,Jack. 
At CTU, doing what you do best. 
And thank God there are people like you who can deal with that world... 
But I can't. 
Please don't say that. 
Oh,Jack. 
Oh,Jack. 
I love you. 
But after today,it's just... 
It won't work. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack,it's David Palmer. 
Yes,Mr. President. 
Words cannot express the debt this country owes you. 
Thank you,sir. 
Jack,this is hard for me, but I don't seem to have a choice. 
The Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consulate. 
What kind of proof? 
Howard Bern made a full confession. 
He identified you as the agent in charge. 
And now the Chinese want me. 
That's right. And we have no choice but to comply. 
I see. 
But what they really want is for you to implicate the government. 
Mr. President,that will never happen. 
I know that. 
They'll put you on trial, propagandize about American arrogance... 
then put you in prison. 
I understand. 
Jack,this is unfair,to say the least, and I'm ashamed of my part in it. 
But I promise you this: I will make it my life's purpose to bring you back to American soil as soon as humanly possible. 
I know you'll do what you can,sir. 
The Secret Service is sending over an agent to CTU. 
He'll place you under house arrest, but you'll have some time to put your affairs in order. 
Jack,my friend,I wish there was something else I could say. 
Mr. President,you're doing what has to be done. 
So will I. 
I know you will. 
Thank you,Jack. 
Thank you,sir This is a messy situation. 
Even if Bauer doesn't implicate the President in the attack on the consulate, there are other problems. 
Bauer is Special Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, which makes him a high-value prisoner. 
A gold mine of information. 
The Chinese could squeeze him dry. 
You're right. 
Plus,the Chinese could share the information with any intelligence agency in the world. 
Eventually,what they get out of Bauer could find its way into the hands of terrorists. 
This could set us back years. 
So the bottom line is... 
I don't think you need me to spell that out for you. 
I assume this isn't coming from President Logan. 
Absolutely not. 
He's expressly forbidden it. 
But that doesn't mean he'd be sorry if it happened. 
So any investigation into Bauer's death... 
Will be brief and superficial. 
I'll see to it personally. 
Fine. I'll take care of it. 
Good. 
The President ordered Jack be extradited,not murdered. 
Cummings wants Bauer dead so the Chinese can't question him. 
President Logan shut him down. 
We were both there. 
It was a weak rebuke,at best. 
This is still conjecture on your part, based on one side of a conversation. 
I know what I heard,and I know Cummings. You don't. 
You really think he's capable of doing something like this? 
He's been doing Logan's dirty work for the last 15 years. 
Logan's gotten used to looking the other way. 
I'd tell the President myself, but he won't listen to me. 
If you don't intervene now,it may be too late. 
...and the Prime Minister is offering 
to host a conference in London for improving the flow of intelligence information among nations. 
Tell him I accept his gracious offer. 
Maybe you should tell him yourself,sir. 
I think he wants to congratulate you personally for steering the country so effectively in its time of crisis. 
Set up a call. 
Yes. sir. 
David. 
I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of goodwill from heads of state around the world. 
Well-deserved,Mr. President. 
You played a role,David. 
You played a role. 
Thank you,sir. 
So what can I do for you? 
Would you excuse us? 
I'd like a moment alone with the President. 
Sir,I have reason to believe that your security chief may be preempting your decision to hand Jack Bauer over to the Chinese. 
Preempting me how? 
By killing him before they can take custody. 
Oh,for God's sake,David, Cummings was just speaking hypothetically. 
You can't take that at face value. 
Besides which,I told him it wasn't an option. 
All I'm asking you to do,sir, is to talk to Cummings, and make sure he understands your order. 
David,I can't indulge some half-baked conspiracy... 
I think I've earned the privilege of having my concerns taken seriously. 
You have. 
But it's also no secret that your presidency was infected with a certain level of paranoia and scandal. 
I won't allow that in my administration. 
Questioning my security chief would not only undermine his authority it would compromise mine,as well. 
Hear no evil... 
I beg your pardon? 
You heard me. 
David,thank you again for your assistance today, but it's time for you to go back to civilian life and let me do my job. 
Hi,Jack. 
Hey. 
I just found out that Logan's going to make you take the fall for everything that happened at the Chinese consulate. 
No one's making me do anything. 
The President didn't have a choice. 
Yeah? Well,that doesn't make it fair,does it? 
It is what it is. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack,are you still at CTU? 
Yes,sir. Tony Almeida's just about to debrief me. 
Listen to me very carefully. 
Do not turn yourself in. 
The man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you. 
Orders from who? 
Someone in Logan's camp. 
They think the Chinese will break you. 
Logan authorize this? 
Not directly,but he won't do anything to stop it. 
Now,listen to me. 
Get out of there now. 
Thank you,sir. 
Bill Buchanan,Regional Director of Division,Los Angeles. 
Dale Spaulding,Secret Service. 
You'll have to sign this before I take Bauer. 
What is it? 
Chain of custody authorization. 
I'm not signing anything until Bauer's been debriefed. 
When that happens,he's all yours. 
Fair enough. 
We'd be burying a million Americans right now if it wasn't for Jack Bauer. 
He's a hero. 
I'm sure he is. 
I'm just following orders. 
I want him treated with the respect he deserves. 
Of course. 
Tony's on line one. He says it's urgent. 
Something to do with Jack. 
Buchanan. 
Bill,it's Tony. 
Jack escaped. 
Escaped? 
He took me by surprise. There was nothing I could do. 
Damn it. 
Look,he's still inside the building, somewhere in Section C. 
I'm the one who ordered the lockdown. 
I'll be right there. 
All right. 
Bauer's trying to get away. 
Jack disabled the surveillance feed a minute ago. 
Were you able to make visual contact before that? 
Yes,he's still in Section C. 
Jack was willing to turn himself over to the Chinese. 
What happened? 
I can't say for sure, but he did get a phone call. 
Who from? 
I don't know. I was waiting for him to finish up. 
Next thing I know,I'm on the ground. 
He cold-cocked me. 
Does Bauer have a weapon? Yeah. 
How many entrances and exits? 
Four. They're all blocked off. 
We'll try to punch through 'em. 
Yeah,but I have two guards posted at each point. 
I'm not taking any chances. 
What are you doing? Going after him. 
BUCHANAN: Wait a second. 
I've got orders to take Jack Bauer into custody. 
I intend to execute those orders. 
This building is my jurisdiction. 
SPAULDING: You lost jurisdiction when you lost Bauer. 
If you want me to stand down,call the President. 
Otherwise,stay out of my way. 
But I'm going with you. 
No,you're not. I'm doing this alone. 
Either you take Tony, or you're not going in. 
Follow me. 
Jack,it's Tony. Are you in here? 
Let me talk to you! There's got to be a way out of this! 
Jack,give it up! 
Stay out of my way. 
This is over! 
I'm going to go bring Jack out. 
You want to stop me,you can shoot me in the back. 
Jack,I'm putting my weapon down. 
I'm coming in. 
Jack? 
Jack! 
He's dead. 
You killed him. 
He was shooting at us. He was aiming wide. 
He was laying down cover fire. 
If he wanted to hit us,he'd have hit us. 
Oh,my God,Jack. 
You killed him,you son of a bitch! You killed him! 
Get him out of here! Take him to the Situation Room. 
I'm sorry. 
God,Jack. 
Give me the epinephrine. 
I hope it's not too late. 
He really looks dead. 
MICHELLE: That was the idea,Chloe. 
How fast is it supposed to take effect? 
Come on,Jack! 
Damn! 
Tony... 
Come on,Jack! Damn it! 
Can you hear me? 
You know where you are? 
Yeah. 
All right,Chloe, I need you to run interference with the local coroner until we can switch bodies. 
That won't cover the autopsy. 
There's not going to be an autopsy. 
They wanted Jack dead. Now he's dead. 
AUDREY: Bill... 
I just talked to my father. 
He said that Jack was being handed over to the Chinese government? 
He was supposed to be... 
but he tried to escape. 
I don't understand. 
Neither do I. 
No. 
Audrey... 
No,don't say it. 
No. 
I'm sorry. 
All right,we're clear. 
You sure you're okay,Jack? 
Yeah,I'm fine. 
You both need to get back to CTU before anyone gets suspicious. 
Tony,you can drop me off anywhere up there. 
All right. 
We've secured your new identity. 
It should help you get across the border. 
Okay. 
Did you get me a clean phone? 
Yeah. Here's a scramble filter. 
You can talk up to one minute undetected. 
I can't thank you both enough for everything. 
You got to get going. 
Jack... 
Be careful. 
Yeah. 
You,too. 
Thank you both for everything. 
Palmer. 
Mr. President,this is Jack Bauer. 
You threaded the eye of the needle. 
I had some help,sir. 
I wanted to thank you for advising me of the situation. 
Mr. President,you saved my life. 
I'm only sorry it came to this. 
Me,too,sir. 
I just wanted to let you know that I was out. 
I'm glad. 
This is probably the last time we'll ever speak. 
Jack,you do understand,when you hang up, for all intents and purposes,Jack Bauer's dead. 
I understand that,sir. 
Mr. President,it's been an honor. 
Same for me,my friend. 
You killed Tariq? 
You can't let Father know. 
He wants me dead, because I messed up with Debbie. 
You were determined to kill him, to kill our own son. 
Nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done not him, not you. 
Your father's following us. 
What? 
It was the only way I could save you. 
( gunshot ) Oh, God! Oh, God! 
I think I got it. 
This is really it. 
I can turn off the override and stop the remaining plants from melting down. 
Did the best I could, sir. 
I hope it works. 
So do I. 
Edgar, what's going on? 
Why are some of the reactors still not shutting down? 
Six of the reactors were immune to the kill sequence. 
Contact Bauer. Either he 
finds the people responsible for planning the override, or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust. 
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago. 
Where'd they go? 
Falstead Security. 
You're going to need to set things up on your end. 
When Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked their location. 
Divert suspicion. 
Fine. 
The override device maintains heat levels within the reactor. 
They can melt down every one of those power plants. 
The man you saw when you were being held captive, right now he's our only lead. 
Stop there. 
I think that's him. 
They're trying to seal us off. 
Well, shouldn't we call CTU? 
No. CTU's gotta 
be compromised. 
That's the only way they'd know we were here. 
Then who are you calling? 
The only person I can trust right now. 
I'm empty. 
( screams ) Jack. 
JACK: Tony! 
Is there any chance this is a mistake? 
For the remaining six nuclear reactors, Arch is taking longer to shut down. 
No. I can recheck it. 
Those plants are firmly in the grip of the override, which has been sealed off. 
We can't get at it. 
Did you send a list of the six affected cities to the President? Yes, sir. 
What about evacuation procedures? 
We've already alerted the National Guard. 
We're just waiting to see how the President wants us to proceed. 
Miss Driscoll, President's ready. 
Okay, put him on. 
Mr. President. 
I understand we've been able to shut down 98 nuclear power plants. 
Yes, sir, but as of now, it appears that our shutdown order will not be effective with the six remaining reactors. 
Not going to be effective? 
What exactly does that mean? 
I'm afraid it means that we could have six nuclear disasters on our hands. 
What are the casualty projections if all six plants... 
melt down? 
450,000 deaths in the first 24 hours. 
The long-range estimate's in the low millions, and that's not taking into account the resulting cancers and birth defects. 
Why were we able to shut down the other power plants, but not these six? 
It's because they're still being controlled by the terrorists, sir. 
You mean because of the override device that they stole today? 
Exactly. 
We have to find the override device itself. 
It's a prototype, and the terrorists have the only one in the world. 
All right, then let's find it. 
I'm going to order the evacuation of those six cities. 
Jim, keep me posted. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
( phone ringing ) All right, let's get back to work. 
Yeah. 
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack. 
Don't let anyone know you're talking to me. 
We got a problem. 
I understand, Marcy. 
Let me see what I can do. 
I have to take this call. 
Yes, sir. 
What's going on? 
First off, sir, I want you to know that Audrey and I are safe, but there was an attempt made on our life at Falstead Security. 
What? 
A group of assassins, well armed, well trained, took out our entire security detail. 
You're gonna need to send a forensic unit over to identify the bodies, but I don't want anyone at CTU to know. 
Why not? 
Because I think someone over at CTU is complicit in the attack. 
How do you know that? 
Sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where we were. 
No one else had that information. 
Is one of Erin's people working with the terrorists? 
Yes, I think so. 
I just don't know who, but it's clear that they didn't want Audrey to make the I.D. 
of the man she saw when you guys were both being held. 
I'm sending a Secret Service detail to pick you two up. 
Sir, please don't do that. 
That's not the right thing to do here. 
Why not? 
I don't want anyone to know where we are. 
That way, I know we'll be safe. 
How do you want me to handle this? 
Remember the sequence we developed for the Melbourne situation? 
Yes. 
Try that. I think it'll work. 
Okay. 
Sir, I've got to go. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I know we're safe. 
Jack, take care of Audrey. 
Yes, sir, I will. 
You okay? 
I'm almost getting used to this. 
Yeah. 
Tony, is it possible that we could have been followed? 
No. We're clear. 
Where are we going? 
We need to lay low for a while. 
What kind of communication do you need? 
A wi-fi and a hard line. 
All right, we'll go back to my place. 
Okay. 
Thank you, Tony. 
Wait till you see it before you thank me. 
No, I mean for picking us up, saving our lives. 
I'm sure you're wondering what's going on. 
Not really, no. 
Something wrong? 
What could be wrong? 
I'm not in the federal prison anymore, thanks to you and President Palmer. 
Michelle left me. 
I... 
( sighs ) You know what? Never mind. 
Why don't you tell me what this is all about? 
You heard about Audrey and her father this morning. 
Yeah. 
We were at Falstead Security so Audrey could make an I.D. 
of a man she saw during the kidnapping. 
I don't get it. Why? 
The secretary's kidnapping was just a cover. 
The terrorists' main objective is to gain control of American power plants from coast to coast. 
The man that Audrey saw is our only lead. 
I thought you weren't in the field anymore, Jack. 
I'm not. 
The secretary is my responsibility. 
I got caught up in it. 
Yeah, well, listen to me very carefully. 
I don't want to get caught up in it. 
So you do whatever you need to do at my place. 
I'm staying out of it, all right? 
Understood. 
Today continues to be a challenge to the strength of the American spirit. 
We have a condition in six cities across the United States in which nuclear power facilities may become unstable. 
While we work to regain control over these facilities, I am also asking our National Guard to assist local authorities to affect an immediate evacuation of those six cities. 
This evacuation is only being issued for all persons living or working... 
The President didn't mention the fact that there isn't enough time left for a complete evacuation. 
If those reactors melt down, there are gonna be at least 50,000 dead per city. 
We still have time to try and find a way to prevent that. 
I can tell you now, Erin, the chances of doing that from here are very low. 
We have to find the people who have the override device. 
What about the hospitals north of there? 
All right. Keep checking. 
Called Dina's sister. 
There's no answer. 
All right, I'll take care of it. 
You and Rafi go check the station again. 
Okay. 
The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors. 
How many are under our control? 
Six. 
More than enough to break their will, but I'm gonna have to manage the override personally, make sure those six melt down on schedule. 
Is there anything I can do? 
Yes. 
Take care of your mess. 
Don't worry, Madwan. 
I give you my word. 
My wife and son will be dead by the end of this day. 
( groaning ) We have to get you to a hospital. 
No. Your father knows 
I've been shot. 
He'll be looking for us in all the hospitals. 
Well, we're going to have to take a chance. 
Mom, you're hurt. 
I'll be okay. 
You won't. 
You need to get to a doctor. 
I'm not afraid of Father. 
You should be. 
He tried to kill me, and then he did this to you. 
He is not my father anymore. 
( groaning ) Mom, please. 
All right. 
Drop me off at an emergency room, but then you have to drive away. 
No. Whatever happens, 
we're staying together. 
Jackie, I'm running a filter for Driscoll. 
Could you baby-sit it for a sec? 
I'll be right back. 
Sure. 
Yes, Marianne. 
I couldn't take your call. 
I was in a meeting. 
Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are still alive. 
My information was accurate. 
Yes. The location was correct, 
but they survived the attack. 
Are they headed back to CTU? 
I haven't heard anything. 
Bauer didn't call in? 
Not that I'm aware of. 
That doesn't make sense. 
( sighs ) Actually, it makes perfect sense. 
Bauer knows there's been a security breach, and you can bet he's told someone here. 
I gotta get out. 
No, you are to stay in until we take care of Bauer and the woman. 
What about me? I 
am not gonna spend the rest of my life in jail. 
You'll be taken care of. 
You know that. Now go. 
There you are. 
What do you need? 
Division is waiting for those projections. 
Well, they're ready to be sent. 
Well, then, send them. 
( knocking ) Yeah. 
Sir, your assistant, Scott Borman, just arrived. 
Should I sent him in? Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Mr. Secretary, it's good to see 
you safe and sound, sir. 
Thanks, Scott. Sit down. 
Is there a problem, sir? 
There's a big problem. 
Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside. 
What do you need me to do? 
I need you to go to Erin Driscoll. 
Tell her that Jack Bauer is no longer at Falstead Security, that he's watching the surveillance videos at an old CTU substation in Torrance. 
Anything about when Jack will call in? 
When they identify the man that Audrey saw. 
I take it Jack and Audrey are nowhere near the CTU substation. 
Right. I'm trying 
to flush out the mole. 
Then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat envelope around this place. 
And if anyone sends out a communication containing the information you planted, that's the spy. 
Yes, sir. 
Let's go. 
Let's go. 
Watch your step. 
The dog next door likes our yard. 
( rooster crows in distance ) Well, here we are, home sweet home. 
Just stay here. 
Oh, God! 
Who the hell are you?! 
Hey, Jack, it's okay. 
This is my friend Jen. 
Tell him to play with his guns outside. 
I'm sorry. 
Excuse me. 
I'm sorry. 
What are you doing here, anyways? 
I thought you were working. 
I'm going in late. 
This is Jack and his friend Audrey. 
This is Jen. 
Hi. 
I-I saw you on TV today. 
You're the daughter of the Secretary of Defense. 
You and your old man were kidnapped this morning. 
Yeah. 
What's going on? 
I'm helping them out with something. 
Could you be a little more specific? 
We need to use Tony's computer. 
What, they don't have computers where you work? 
Listen, babe, we have a situation here, all right? 
They need to lie low for a little bit. 
We can't let anybody know they're here, all right? 
Whatever. 
I'm leaving anyway. 
Tony... 
Jen, you can't go anywhere. 
Why not? 
We can't leave until Jack and Audrey take off. 
We can't take a chance. 
What kind of chance? 
I work at a bar. 
I'm sorry, Jen. 
We're not gonna be long. 
Look, stay as long as you want. 
I have a job. 
He doesn't. 
Jen, can I talk to you for a second? 
Please? 
Sorry. 
No, she seems real sweet. 
Look, we were fighting for our lives a few minutes ago, and if it hadn't been for Tony, we would have been dead. 
Now, I've been through a lot today, and I'm sure when this is all over, your boss will understand. 
And if he doesn't? 
I can have him killed. 
Knock yourself out. 
Thank you. 
How are you guys making out with that? 
Good. I just have convert this 
so I can read it. 
And then, hopefully, you can make an I.D. 
from the surveillance video. 
I have some software for that. 
Let me dig it out. 
Thanks. 
( quietly ): You told me about Tony, but I didn't know that Michelle left him. 
Yeah, a few months after he got out of prison. 
I thought he went to prison because of her. 
He saved her life, and she paid him back by leaving him? 
That's the way Tony sees it, too. 
Didn't happen exactly like that. 
When Tony got out of prison, he was angry. 
He couldn't get a job. 
Personally, I don't think he wanted one. 
He started drinking. 
He pushed her away. 
What is she doing now? 
Deputy director over at Division. 
I hope he can help us. 
If he can, he will. 
All right, here we go. 
You got it, Tony? 
Yeah, I got it right here. 
Thanks. 
We're in. 
Start the ball rolling with Driscoll? 
Yep. Headed into 
her briefing now. 
She's not gonna be happy when she finds out we're using her to flush out the mole. 
I am surprised you felt the need to keep her in the dark about this one. 
As long as there's a leak in CTU, we keep everyone in the dark. 
Make sure that you're online and that your databases are unlocked. 
As soon as Jack sends in the image, I need you to be able to move as quickly as possible to make this I.D., okay? 
I don't understand why Jack's doing this at the old substation. 
Well, apparently there's technical reasons. 
I didn't speak with him directly. 
Who did? 
I did. 
He also asked that his whereabouts be kept strictly internal until he contacts us. 
All right, let's go. 
Old CTU substation in Torrance. 
I remember this lady. 
We saw him around here. 
There he is. 
You sure that's him? 
Yes. 
I'm gonna route this through the D.C. office. 
Tony, she's on the phone. 
We can't have her making calls. 
We need the phone. 
Go to hell. 
I can't go to work. 
I can't talk on the phone? 
Just give me the phone. 
Go to hell! 
Give me the damn phone! 
( thud ) ( screams ) ( typing, computer blipping ) Go ahead. 
Thanks. 
This is Marcie. 
Marcie, it's Jack. 
I'm sending you the image we need I.D.'d. 
We're ready to receive. 
Okay. 
You positive this came from her system? 
Yeah. 
The voices were digitized and scrambled, but we were able to clean it up enough to make out the words "CTU substation. " 
Where's security? 
They're on the way. 
Thanks, Scott. 
Yes, Mr. Secretary? 
Erin, I'm sorry to report there's been a breach in CTU. 
What? 
The information Scott gave you about Jack is false. 
What do you mean false? 
Jack and Audrey were ambushed at Falstead Security. 
They survived the attack, but it's clear that someone in this office gave them up. 
With all due respect, sir, you knew about this and you didn't tell me? 
Being left out of the loop is not something you should be concerned about. 
I assume you're telling me now because your sting operation yielded a result. 
Yes, it did. 
Read that. 
Where is she? 
She's being taken into custody. 
Join me. 
Miss Driscoll, what's going on? 
Go with these men. 
What for? 
You're under arrest, Gavin. 
DRISCOLL: You've been passing classified information. 
What? 
What are you talking about? 
Take her to Holding. 
Miss Driscoll, what are you doing? 
Miss Driscoll, I haven't done anything. 
Miss Driscoll, this is a mistake. 
What is happening? 
Can someone please tell me what is going on? 
I didn't do anything, please! 
Get back to work. 
I don't care how you divide up her files. 
I just want everything off her system and then sent to me. 
And enter new pass codes. 
We can't just do this on your authority. 
Edgar... 
it's okay. 
But he works for DOD, not CTU. 
Yeah, well, he's the one that found the mole, right? 
And Heller wants him to have joint authority. 
Finish up here and get back to station two. 
The program we set up for the reactor is almost finished compiling. 
Can I see this? 
Sure. 
What makes you so sure Sarah's the mole? 
She was sending out encoded information about Jack Bauer. 
I don't think she would compromise Bauer or the investigation. 
That's how she was able to fool everybody, Edgar. 
She's the last person you'd expect to do it. 
All right, just get me those files. 
It's right here. 
2:22 p. m. Message sent: 
"Old CTU substation in Torrance. " 
This doesn't seem weird to you that she would leave it on her system like this? 
She didn't just leave it; it was encrypted. 
Yeah, with a Bainbridge algorithm. 
Come on, it's so old school, it's like saying, "Please decode me. " 
Let's face it, Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. 
( sighs ) ( door opens ) Please, Miss Driscoll... 
I promise you, there's been some kind of mistake. 
How could there be a mistake? 
Your system was isolated the message was sent from it while you were there. 
Somebody set me up. 
That's the only explanation I can think of. 
Tell me how that's possible. 
Someone backed into my system through a subnet, planted something. 
That's the first thing we checked. 
None of them were compromised. 
Let's stop playing games. 
Thousands of people's lives are at stake! 
Where are the people who control the override? 
I don't know. 
That's what I was working on. 
Who did you send the message about Jack to? 
I didn't. 
Miss Driscoll... ( sighs ) 
I would never betray our country or endanger people's lives. 
You know that. 
Was it the same contact who coordinated the attempt on Jack and Audrey's life at Falstead Security? 
I don't know. It wasn't me. 
I learned my lesson today with Sherrick, and I am no longer going to err on the side of caution in these interrogations. 
Do you get my meaning? 
I don't know what to say. 
Eric, no. 
Please don't do this. 
Eric... Miss Driscoll... 
( zapping ) ( gasping ) Please stop. 
If you want it to stop, you tell me where the Dobson override is and who has it. 
( crying ): I swear, I don't know anything. 
Wait. 
( crying ) There's got to be an explanation for this. 
You got to give me some time to think. 
( zapping ) Talk to me, Sarah. 
Talk to me. 
Miss Driscoll... 
I'm not a spy. 
I'm not. 
Please believe me. 
Driscoll, please. 
I'm concerned. 
Do you think you can break her in time? 
I can break her in time, if she's guilty. 
According to Scott, there is no way that this could be a mistake. 
I agree it's hard evidence, but I've known Sarah for eight months, and she doesn't fit the profile. 
How do you want to handle it? 
I'll watch for a few more minutes, then I'll go back in. 
I'll brief Jack. 
( crying ): Eric, please... 
please. 
Eric! 
What are you doing? 
Just checking the surveillance from later that night to see who he's talking to. 
Did you find anything? 
No, not yet. 
Anybody want a beer? 
I could use one. 
( phone rings ) This is Bauer. 
HELLER: We found our mole. Who is it? 
Sarah Gavin, works in Comm. 
Is she working alone? 
As far as we know. 
Okay, I'll call Marcie, tell her the CTU channels are open. 
We'll start sharing data. 
How's Audrey doing? 
She's good, she's resting. 
Sir, I think now would be a good time to send someone to have her picked up. 
We're at 21408 Kipling, North Hollywood. 
What's there? 
A friend. 
I'll send the Secret Service. 
Thank you, sir. 
Your father's sending someone over to pick you up, take you back to CTU. 
( quietly ): Okay. 
Don't you think you've made me miss enough TV today, Jack? 
( sighs ) Why didn't you ever call me? 
( scoffs softly ) For what? 
I've been there. 
I could help. 
( laughs ) I'm considered a traitor to this country. 
My wife left me. 
So how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack? 
Yeah. 
( sighs ) Look... 
I owed you for getting me out of prison. 
But today, I repaid that debt. 
And to tell you the truth, all you do is remind me of a past I'm trying to forget. 
So why don't you do me a favor. 
Do what you need to do here, and let's leave it at that, All right? 
Yep. 
So, how did this happen? 
I was working in the yard and... backed into a nail 
that sticks out of our gate. 
( groans ): Oh. 
This looks like a gunshot wound. 
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor. 
It was my fault. 
I was supposed to fix that gate last week. 
All right, you're gonna need a tetanus shot, then I'll stitch it up. 
Thank you, Doctor. 
I'll be right back. 
Go watch him. 
DINA: What's going on? 
He said something to the nurse. 
Did he make a phone call? 
Not that I could see. 
Did she? 
No. 
Good. 
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they called the police. 
At least the police could protect us from Father. 
It would be bad to go to jail for the rest of our lives. 
That's what would happen. 
So where are we going to go after we leave here? 
If we can get out of the city and stay somewhere for a couple of days, I can arrange for us to get out of the country. 
( sighs ) ( crying softly ) ( phone rings ) Yeah? 
Jack, it's Marcie. 
We got a match. 
Who is it? 
Name is Henry Powell. 
I posted everything on that secure site. 
Hold on a second. 
( typing ) Okay, I got it. 
He's a computer consultant. 
He used to work for McLennen-Forster. 
Wait a second, McLennen-Forster. 
They're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants. 
Yeah, well, he's not there anymore, but he freelances for them, and he's definitely still in L.A. 
How do you know that? Because 
he's trying to leave the city. 
We just found out he scheduled a chopper to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes. 
I thought all air traffic had been grounded. 
It is. He must have 
some well-connected friends. 
He got a special clearance. 
Son of a bitch. 
Where in Van Nuys? 
The helipad at the Larchmont Building. Okay, I'm gonna 
want you to ground his flight but not until I get there. 
I don't want him to see me coming. 
Jack, they're here. 
Can you make it in time? 
I'm gonna try. 
Audrey, get your things. 
We got to go. 
Agent Davis, Secret Service. Jack Bauer. 
You're gonna take the secretary's daughter straight back to CTU. 
Those are our orders. 
Okay. 
You got a car for me? 
It's right over there. 
Thank you. 
Audrey, they're ready. 
This is Agent Davis. He's 
gonna take care of you. Okay. 
Be careful. 
I will. You, too. 
CTU, Patterson. 
This is Jack. 
Let me speak to Erin Driscoll. 
Jack, I just got the file on Henry Powell. 
I'm going through it now. 
He's trying to leave the city. 
I've got to get over to Van Nuys. 
You want air backup? 
No, I want to keep a low profile. 
I don't want to spook him. 
The soonest I can get you a ground package is 30 minutes. 
That's gonna be too long. 
When is his flight due to take off? 
Less than 15 minutes. 
What do you want to do, Jack? 
He's most likely on his own. 
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself. 
All right. 
I'll send a team anyway. 
I'll be in touch. 
What are you gonna try and handle by yourself? 
Don't worry about it. 
It's covered. 
Jack, it'd be pretty stupid of me to let you die right after I risked my life trying to save you. 
Could you use my help? 
Yeah. 
All right, let's go. 
Curtis. 
Yeah, Edgar? 
Has Sarah confessed to anything yet? No. 
What are they doing to her? 
Don't worry about it. 
Just get back to work, all right? 
Curtis? 
What did Edgar want? 
Why do you care? 
Well, you should let him know we need his full attention Get back to your station. 
What's that? 
Just something to numb the arm so that I can close the wound. 
Okay. 
I really wish you'd let me admit you. 
This wound is serious. 
There's a chance of an infection here. 
No, Doctor, please. 
Do whatever you can, and we'll leave. 
Behrooz, where are you going? 
I'll be right back, Mom. 
WOMAN ( over P.A. ): 
Dr. Travis, 
you have a visitor in the main lobby. 
Dr. Travis... 
Mom, the police are here. 
Did you call the police? 
This is a gunshot wound. 
I told you it wasn't. 
DOCTOR: Then why are you acting so strangely? 
Let's go. 
You shouldn't leave you need to be treated. 
Wait! 
Let's go! 
Come on... 
Come on! 
( tires screech ) Marianne. 
( sighs ) What is it, Edgar? 
About an hour ago, you asked me to bump up your security clearance. 
I was a little busy with the override, but I finally got it for you. 
Great. Thank you. 
What? 
You'll need to pick a password. 
I set up the screen on server five. 
( sighs ) There you go. 
You need to use the same password as the one that unlocks your system files. 
Okay. 
Edgar. 
Why do you keep looking at me? 
I don't keep looking at you. 
Let's go outside. 
I want to talk to you in private. 
I don't want to talk to you in private. 
I have a lot of work to do. 
It is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar, to have to remind you repeatedly that I could step into Driscoll's office any moment and have you fired. 
Curtis, I need to talk to you. 
What is it? 
I need you to walk with me to Driscoll's office. 
Walk with you? 
Please, Curtis. 
Sorry to interrupt. 
What is it? 
You got the wrong person. 
Sarah's not guilty of anything. 
How do you know? 
Because I just sneaked into Marianne's system. 
She used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU, made it look like Sarah was the one. 
That's not possible. 
Sarah's workstation was isolated from the subnet. 
She didn't use the subnet. 
How'd she get through? 
She used a plain old AC power line. 
What? 
That's the last place anybody would ever look. 
Plus it has plenty of bandwidth to carry the signal. 
Where is she? 
She's trying to leave the building. 
Lock down the exits. 
( alarm buzzing ) ( grunting ) You're under arrest. 
Examine the contents. 
Impound the car. 
Strip it and search it. 
I got her. 
( car alarms blaring ) Mr. Powell? 
Yeah, let's go. 
Uh, sorry, sir, we can't. 
What? 
Uh, flight's been grounded. 
No. McLennan-Forster 
has special ordinance. 
The paperwork was sent. 
I know, but the order was superseded. 
By who? 
Department of Defense. 
You're going to fly me out of here. 
Please, sir. 
Now! Get in. 
All right, where we going? 
Just get us in the air and fly east. 
There it is. 
Do not take off! 
Do not take off! 
Go! Go! 
Hold on! 
Shut it down! 
Come on, go. 
Drop the weapon now. now! 
Shut it down. 
Get out of the helicopter now. 
Move! 
Get up! 
Move! 
Put your hands on the roof of the truck. 
Some people I know, they'll pay you. 
Shut up. 
I got his cell phone. 
Bring me the bag. 
Put your hands behind your back. 
( panting ) Who are you guys? 
Police? FBI? 
Actually, I'm currently unemployed. 
I'll make it worth your while. 
Put him in the back. 
Come on. 
( gunshot ) He's dead, Jack. 
Damn it!
