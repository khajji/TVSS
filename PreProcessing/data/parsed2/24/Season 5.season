CTU is being absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security, and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol. 
MILES: Ms. Raines signed 
a detailed statement documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU, and by you, in particular. 
CHLOE: I don't understand, why am I staying and everybody else is being let go? 
Because Ms. Raines requested 
that you keep your position. 
I had to keep Karen from replacing you, that's why I signed the document, I didn't have a choice. 
Why were those men trying to kill you? 
David had a source inside the White House. 
Who's the source? 
Mrs. Logan's assistant. 
I have proof about who's behind everything that's happened today. 
( whispering ): Someone killed David... 
and they just tried to kill me. 
I have to go now... 
Give me what I need! 
They kidnapped my little girl. 
Evelyn. 
I promise you we're going to get your daughter back. 
I already told them I wouldn't give up any information until I have my daughter. 
JACK ( over radio ): We need Henderson alive; do not shoot to kill. 
Did you bring what we discussed? 
I have the evidence with me. 
I want my daughter. 
She's moving. 
Give me the evidence, Evelyn. 
Now. 
( gunfire ) ( screaming ) Wayne, I didn't get him if you got a shot, take it! 
( gunshots ) ( tires squealing ) Chloe, it's Jack, Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car! 
Do you have him on satellite? 
We can't lose him! 
Evelyn's been hit. 
JACK: It's not serious, but it's gonna have to be dressed. 
Evelyn, you've got your daughter back, now tell me what I need to know. 
Who is behind this? 
Is it the vice president? 
The vice president has nothing to do with this! 
LOGAN ( over phone ): You promised me you would control the situation. 
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir. 
Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around long enough to tell anybody else what they know. 
HENDERSON ( over phone ): I will not let you down. 
See that you don't. 
WAYNE: The lanes are cut off. 
Okay, Evelyn, I need you to stay focused. 
The recording of the phone call that you made between President Logan and Henderson is in a safety deposit box which bank? 
Which bank? 
City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills. 
Where's the key? 
My jacket pocket. 
Mom? 
JACK: It's all right, sweetheart, your mom's going to be fine. 
She's going to be fine, okay? 
Jack, you heard what they said. 
We have to get off this road, there are military patrols everywhere. 
There's a motel up there on the right. 
Turn in there. 
I want to go home. 
We're gonna get you home, honey. 
We're gonna get you home. 
Wayne, can you get us a room. 
I'll keep watch. 
Make sure you keep pressure on the wound, I'll be right back. 
( phone speed dialing ) ( ringing ) Hello? 
JACK ( over phone ): Audrey, it's Jack. 
Have you got Henderson on satellite yet? 
No, Chloe wasn't able to reposition in time. 
JACK: Damn it! 
Are you still on a secure line? 
Yes. Why, 
what's going on? 
Evelyn didn't implicate Gardner. 
She implicated President Logan. 
Oh, my God, Jack. 
Logan? Are you sure? 
She said he was responsible for everything that happened today, starting with providing the terrorists with the nerve gas. 
That's what David Palmer found out. 
That's why they killed him. 
Are you saying that President Logan ordered Palmer's assassination? 
Henderson gave the order. 
But Evelyn says she has evidence that shows that President Logan was complicit. 
What kind of evidence? 
She recorded a conversation earlier this morning between Henderson and President Logan. 
She put it in a safety deposit box in a bank. 
We're on our way to get it now. 
Jack, the city is under martial law. 
I know. I need you to upload 
every military checkpoint to my PDA so we can navigate our way around them. 
All right, I'll take care of that. 
Audrey, as soon as I have the recording, we're going to have to involve your father. 
We need someone in the government, someone credible, to present the evidence. 
All right. 
He's on his way back from a summit in Japan. 
I'll call him on the plane. 
Okay. Make sure 
you leave CTU before you do anything. 
You don't think that they can be trusted? 
Right now, we can't trust anyone. 
Logan will have every federal law enforcement agency, the military, all at his disposal. 
And he will use them to try and stop us. 
Don't fill your father in on the particulars. 
Just try and set up the meeting. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording. 
All right, I'll upload those checkpoints. 
Yeah. 
Wayne? 
The bank manager was listed. 
That's his address, he's not far. 
Good. Let's get them 
in the room. 
( gently ): Hey... we need 
to get inside now. 
Come on, it's okay. 
JACK: Give me your arm. 
( straining ) You can sit right here, okay? 
Okay. Lie down 
here on the bed. 
( groaning and panting ) JACK: I'm sorry, but it's not safe enough to take you to a hospital yet. 
Let me see, let me see. 
( moaning ) Wayne? 
Take Amy outside for a second. 
( groans ) Okay, even though the bullet went through, I'm still going to have to clean out this wound. 
It's gonna hurt. 
But I promise you I'll get you to a hospital as soon as I can. 
In the meantime, I'm going to have Wayne look after you. 
No. I'll be fine. 
You need to get the evidence. 
And you'll need help. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Keep pressure on it. 
Sweetheart, you can see your mom now. 
Give me the car keys. 
Let's go. 
I haven't been able to pick up Bauer's trail yet. 
LOGAN ( on phone ): So he got away. 
And there's nothing to stop him and Wayne Palmer from going to the media with everything they know. 
Jack knows there's no point in going public until he has proof. 
He won't make any accusations until he has that evidence in his hand. 
This evidence, this... this 
recording that Evelyn made of our conversation. 
Are you any closer to finding out where she's hidden it? 
No, sir, not yet. 
But she was wounded, and I will find her; we're monitoring hospitals, emergency services. 
This is containable, I promise you. 
Please spare me your promises, Mr. Henderson. 
It's all gone wrong. 
None of this should have happened. 
All these killings... 
This whole thing was planned to make our country safer. 
Stronger. 
To protect our interests. 
And it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer. 
Mr. President, 
what's done is done. 
And right now, we have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording. 
No. 
You have to focus on it. 
Why haven't the analysts finished the hourlies? 
They're still getting up to speed on CTU's protocols. 
We knew this wasn't going to be a seamless transition. 
Sometimes I wonder if it was even a necessary one. 
Karen... 
CTU's performance today has been considerably less than stellar. 
Dozens of people have been killed. 
And they weren't even able to prevent an attack on themselves. 
Do you really believe, under the circumstances, that we could have done any better? 
CHLOE: Ms. Hayes? 
The president is on line one. 
Put him through to Bill Buchanan's office, I'll be working out of there from now on. 
And have Medical notify me as soon as Bierko has regained consciousness. 
Miles. 
Yes, Mr. President? 
Karen. 
Do you know where Jack Bauer is? 
Not at the moment, sir. 
He was due back here 30 minutes ago to lead the Bierko interrogation. 
He's gone off grid. 
I'm not surprised. 
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer. 
I want you to run point on this, and I want you to make this CTU's top priority. 
Yes, sir. 
For purposes of the warrant, I'll need to know what Bauer's being charged with. 
His role in the assassination of President David Palmer. 
But I understood that he'd been exonerated of that charge, sir. 
You, yourself, reinstated his credentials. 
I know, but I didn't have all the facts then. 
Some new evidence has come to light. 
New evidence? 
Yes. 
I'm looking at it right now, and I will forward it to you at the appropriate time. 
Yes, sir. 
Karen. 
Obviously, this is a very sensitive matter, and for now I would like you to treat the origin of this warrant as confidential. 
Understood, sir. 
Put out an alert on Jack Bauer to all federal law enforcement agencies and NSA. 
I'll also get military the warrant they have more men on the street than anyone. 
I don't like this. 
Pulling our resources off finding Christopher Henderson to go after Jack Bauer without knowing the evidence? 
It's a direct order from the president. 
You know, if we really want to find Bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help. 
Starting with Audrey Raines. 
What's this? 
Chloe, open it up and make it look like this is what we're talking about. 
Okay... 
Can you get me a secure channel, so the calls on my cell phone can't be monitored? 
Using a VPN pathway, sure. 
Take somebody about an hour to crack. 
Why, what's going on? 
I just spoke with Jack. 
Gardner isn't the one who's behind this. 
It's President Logan. 
What? 
Jack is on his way getting proof. 
I'm leaving now to go help him. 
Take a CTU walkie. 
( computer chimes ) Audrey. 
It's a warrant for Jack's arrest. 
It's starting. 
What do we do? 
Heading out? 
Yes, I'm going to try to grab a couple hours of sleep. 
I came to talk to both of you about the warrant. 
Well, let's start with why the hell it was issued. 
There's new evidence implicating Jack in David Palmer's assassination. 
That's ridiculous. 
I was there when the assassin confessed. 
All you have to do is check the log. 
I know about the logs, Chloe. 
My orders are to bring Jack in. 
New evidence? 
Have you seen it? 
It's forthcoming. 
Who ordered this, Karen? 
I'm not at liberty to discuss that. 
When was the last time you spoke with Jack? 
About an hour ago. 
We haven't had contact since. 
I hope I don't have to remind either one of you that you have a legal obligation to notify me if Jack contacts you. 
Look, I know this may seem odd to the both of you frankly, it does to me but let's remember it's in everyone's best interest to bring Jack in peacefully. 
Have a good night. 
Thank you. 
VALERIE ( over phone ): Harris. 
Valerie? 
Audrey's on her way. 
What's your status? 
We're placing the transponder on Audrey's car right now. 
HAYES ( on phone ): Good. 
There won't be many cars on the road, so use the tracker and stay out of sight. 
Will do. 
We don't want anything to stop Audrey from leading us to Bauer. 
That's the house. 
Okay. 
What's the bank manager's name? 
Carl Mossman. 
You got your gun? 
Yeah, but we don't need them for this, do we? 
He's not going to let into his bank in the middle of the night unless he thinks he has to. 
Jack, why don't we just try telling him the truth? 
Would you believe it? The 
only way we're going to have his full compliance is if he's scared. 
If you're uncomfortable with that, you should stay here. 
( grunts ) Damn it. 
They've got a magnetic alarm. 
( panting ) We're in. 
MAN ( on TV ): ...that will take place 
within the hour. 
At that time, President Logan is scheduled to make a statement to the American people about the successful resolution of today's terrorist threat. 
Did you hear something? 
Like what? 
I don't know. 
Carl? 
Hang on. 
Carl? 
I'll be right back. 
Don't you move. 
Rose, call the police...! 
( groans ) Cover him. 
Put the phone down. 
Put the phone down now! 
Bring him in here! 
Just stay calm, and everything will be fine. 
Oh my God. Carl... 
Take a seat on the bed. 
Okay, look, our money and jewelry's in floor safe in the closet. 
We're not interested in that. 
You're gonna get us into your bank. 
( panting ) I can't do that. 
It's not that I won't. I can't. 
The alarm system and the vault only allow entry during business hours. 
Don't lie to me. 
Every bank has procedures to allow access during an emergency. 
Hey! No, no! 
I'll take you to the bank. 
( quietly whimpers ) JACK: Slowly get up, get dressed. 
Go on. It's all right, 
it's all right, it's all right. 
I want four of your neckties. 
Tie her up to the chair. 
Ankles and wrists. Make 
sure she doesn't move. 
Come on. 
Yes, hi. This is Audrey Raines. 
I need to speak with Secretary Heller, please. 
Mr. Secretary, there's 
a call coming in for you on an over-air encrypted channel. 
It's your daughter. 
Audrey, is everything okay? 
Hi. Uh, yes, I'm okay. 
Dad, I need your help. 
Is this a secure line? 
Very secure. 
Is this about the arrest order for Jack? 
I was just informed. 
Dad, I can't go into details right now, but Jack is innocent. 
He's being set up. 
Set up by whom? 
What the hell is going on, Audrey? 
You call me this morning, to tell me that Jack's alive. 
Now I get word he's a suspect again in the Palmer assassination. 
Dad, I can't talk to you about it right now. 
I need to see you in person. 
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles? 
Dad, I would never ask you to do this if it wasn't extremely important. 
All right, yes. 
Thank you. 
The closest airport is Van Nuys. 
We're about an hour out. 
I'll call you on final approach. 
Okay. Thank you. 
I'll see you there. 
I'll see you. 
Bye. 
Doug! 
Yes, sir. 
We have to make a stop in L.A. 
And keep it off the manifest. 
Yes, sir. 
Pull over. 
She stopped. 
Corner of Alderton and Davis. 
It's a gas station. 
CHLOE: O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's me. 
Hold on. 
Okay, switched over to my own VPN. Now they can't 
monitor either end of the conversation. 
Do you have the walkie? 
Yeah. Hang on. 
All right, what do I do with it? 
Tune to proprietary channel 17, turn the sensitivity up all the way. 
See if you pick up a pilot signal. 
Okay, hold on. 
( high-pitched squeal ) Wow. Do you hear that? 
That's what I figured they put a tracker on you. 
I found it. All right, Chloe, 
I got it. Thank you. 
Audrey, you need to disable your phone by taking the battery out as soon as you can. 
All right, I have to wait for a call from Jack and then I will. 
Okay. 
( sighs ) Yes. 
Sir, it's almost time. 
Yes. 
The press conference. 
That's right. 
Mr. President, 
if I could have a moment... 
Uh, I should be done with my statement shortly, Hal. 
This is potentially time sensitive, sir. 
I just got an alert that a warrant has been issued for Jack Bauer. 
Thank you, Aaron. 
Yes, sir. 
What about the warrant? 
Well, it's an executive branch warrant. 
I didn't issue it, so it must have come from you. 
That's right, it came from me. 
Well, as you've put me in charge of overseeing CTU and the Homeland Security transfer, don't you think you should have discussed it with me first? 
I appreciate everything you've done today, Hal, but the last time I checked, I was still Commander in Chief. 
Of course, Mr. President, 
but Jack Bauer? 
It doesn't make any sense. 
We should be treating that man like a hero. 
I've gone over the logs. 
Walt Cummings has confessed that he arranged Palmer's assassination, framing Bauer. 
Well, clearly, Cummings was protecting Bauer. 
Why? 
I don't know why. 
But the fact remains I have received confirmation from Intelligence sources that Jack Bauer was, without question, the shooter. 
Which sources? 
That's enough! 
I'm not going to stand here and have my orders challenged. 
You have concerns, Hal. 
We'll sort this all out once Bauer's in custody. 
Does that suit you? 
Yes, sir. 
Good. 
Mom? 
( water running ) ( sobbing ) ( sobbing continues ) Amy? 
Sweetheart, it's okay. 
( groaning ) Hold on. I'm coming. 
( sobbing continues ) Hold on, sweetheart, I'm coming. 
( groaning ) Mom! Mom! 
Mommy. 
WOMAN: 911. What's your emergency? 
My mom-- she passed out. 
I can't wake her up. 
Calm down. Tell me your name. 
Amy. My mom's name is Evelyn. 
What's your mom's last name? 
Martin. 
Her name's Evelyn Martin. 
All right, honey, now tell me where you are. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah. 
MAN: Sir, a call is coming in to the 911 operator from a Motel 6 on Porter Valley Drive requesting medical assistance for an Evelyn Martin. 
LOGAN: My fellow Americans, it is with great relief that I announce that the terrorist threat our nation faced today is over. 
More than an hour ago, federal counter-terrorist agents, under my direction, thwarted the latest attack on innocent civilians, the nature of which was kept secret due to national security. 
This was done with the public's best interest in mind. 
He really did it. 
Ma'am? 
Charles. 
He stopped the terrorists, the treaty was signed. 
He said he would ride out this crisis, and everything would be okay. 
And it is. 
I should have trusted him. 
Yes, ma'am. 
What's wrong, Aaron? 
I'm just a little battle worn. 
LOGAN: They attempted to derail the historic accord... 
Jack, why are we stopping here? 
There's too many military checkpoints in the area. 
They'll stop our car. 
We have to go the rest of the way on foot. 
How far is the bank from here? 
About a quarter of a mile that way. 
( phone ringing ) Be right back. 
( phone ringing ) Aaron, it's Jack. 
Jack, are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest for your role in David Palmer's assassination? 
No, but that makes sense. 
The Vice President's not the one who's behind this, is he? 
No, it's Logan. 
They're going to have every agency and the military looking for you. 
And Logan is the only one who can call them off. 
As soon as we have the evidence in hand, We're gonna pass it off to Secretary of Defense Heller. 
After that, it's not gonna matter. 
Is there anything I can do for you, Jack? 
Keep your eyes open and watch your back. 
Will do. 
Get out of the car. 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Move, move. 
( vehicle approaching ) ( whispers ): Take cover, go! 
Not a word. 
WOMAN: Ms. Hayes, Valerie Harris 
is on line two for you. 
She says it's urgent. 
Valerie, what's happening? 
We lost Audrey Raines. 
What? 
She found the tracker and transferred it to a DWP truck at a gas station. 
Damn it. How did 
she find it? 
She's got no field experience. 
I don't know. 
The only reason we discovered it is the DWP guy stopped to check a faulty power line. 
All right, hold your position and wait for my instructions. 
Will do. 
MILES: Papazian. 
Audrey Raines ditched her transponder. 
I need you to redirect satellite surveillance and track her. 
I can redirect CalTrans and maybe one SAT-LINK, but the rest are dedicated to finding Bauer. 
Following Audrey should lead us right to Bauer. 
Just get it done and tell me when you've got something. 
I'm on it. 
Against the wall. 
Watch him. 
Just do what he says, Carl. 
Do what he says and you'll be home before you know it. 
Right. 
What's the emergency procedure to enter the bank? 
I have 30 seconds to put my key in the alarm panel, then I enter my code. 
You enter the wrong code and alert the police, all I have to do is make one call, your wife is dead. 
You understand me? 
Yes. 
Let's go. 
Where's the vault? 
Take us around the back, stay away from the windows. 
How do I open it? 
There's a 12-digit code, but it's a timed unlock procedure, which allows enough time for the police to arrive in the event that someone should trigger the silent alarm. 
Write the code down for me. 
Take him over to one of the desks, keep an eye on him. 
I know you. 
No, you don't. 
Yes, I do. 
You're David Palmer's brother. 
I saw you on TV this morning. 
You were there when he was shot. 
Now, what the hell are you doing in my bank? 
And who is he? 
Listen, I know it's absurd to ask you to trust me under these circumstances, but believe me, you don't want to know. 
Oh, come on. 
You threaten me with a gun, you kidnap me, you're robbing my bank. 
Now, I deserve to know what the hell is going on here. 
Fine. 
Jack and I believe there's evidence inside of one of your safety deposit boxes that's gonna prove who was behind the assassination of my brother, okay? 
JACK: Wayne. 
What's going on? 
What do you want me to say, Jack? 
He recognized me. 
It's all right. 
Mr. Mossman, 
how long is the delay before the vault opens? 
Five minutes. 
Is that true what he said? 
Is that why you two are here? 
Yes. 
Why didn't you just wait till morning, get a subpoena? 
The people that are behind this will never let it go that far. 
They've already tried to kill me twice tonight, Carl. 
And they're gonna try again the very first chance they get. 
( sniffs ) ( moans ) Mom. 
MAN: Miss Martin, you're in shock. 
But you're going to be okay. 
You know my name? 
( silenced gunshots ) Where's Bauer? 
( screams ) You did? 
Well, that's good. 
I'm glad. 
I'll get back to you. 
I thought you went to bed. 
No. 
I, uh, watched you with the press. 
Well, um, that was Morry, and he thought it went pretty well. 
Good. 
But that doesn't begin to describe it. 
Charles, you have had to deal with more crisis today than any president in an entire term. 
You... 
were magnificent. 
Magnificent. 
Well, I like the sound of that. 
Especially coming from you. 
I'm so proud of you. 
I hope I haven't embarrassed you too much as your First Lady. 
Stop. No. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
I mean, you walked up to the edge a couple times, but nobody noticed. 
I'll try to find a compliment in there somewhere. 
I'm sorry, Marty. 
I didn't... 
Wow. 
I was so selfish today. 
No. 
You had so much on your plate, you didn't need me piling more on. 
No, I... 
Please don't say anything. 
Just accept my apology. 
I do. 
I do, I accept your apology. 
( phone ringing ) I have to take this privately. 
Who is it? 
Now, what difference does it make? 
Please, Marty. 
I thought the crisis was over. 
I thought you and I... 
( phone ringing ) All right. 
Yes. 
We know where Bauer is. 
Evelyn gave him up. 
Well, then take care of it. 
My men are heading there now. 
Good. 
Let me know when it's done. 
I'm sorry, honey. 
I guess I haven't gotten used to the idea that... 
that the crisis is over. 
When what's done? 
What? 
You just said, "Let me know when it's done." 
Oh, that was Jamey. 
I asked her to write me a radio speech for tomorrow morning. 
We found Audrey Raines. 
Where? 
She's heading north toward Mulholland. 
Connect me with Harris. 
( phone rings ) Harris. 
Valerie, we have a fix on Raines. 
She's heading toward the Sepulveda Pass, coming up on Mulholland. 
Copy that. 
Let's go. 
( starts engine ) ( tires screeching ) Chloe? 
Do you have a minute? 
No. 
What is it? 
I was assigned to log all satellite and ground video activity, but part of the vector is locked out. 
Locked out? 
What do you mean? 
I mean, someone's taken control of one of the satellites using a class one priority override. 
Do you know anything about it? 
No. 
I'll look into it. 
Thanks. 
( sighs ) Crap. 
All points are covered, sir. 
The perimeter is secure. 
Do you have a visual? 
I did, briefly. 
All right, listen. 
You tell your men the instant, and I mean the instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building you take him down. 
Then, kill the others and secure the recording. 
( buzzer sounds ) Which one is it? 
Twenty-three. 
MOSSMAN: Mr. Palmer, 
I admired your brother a great deal. 
He was a great man. 
Thank you. 
HENDERSON ( on tape ): It had to be done, sir. 
LOGAN: I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson. 
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 
Palmer was nosing around. 
He'd have found out about your involvement. 
For God's sake, sir, he called your wife. 
I can handle my wife. 
Right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards. 
You're protected, sir. 
That's president Logan's voice. 
Every thread ends with Cummings. 
He thinks he's running this, And you need to keep playing it that way. 
I know my part, Mr. Henderson. 
You just do as you're told. 
Oh, my God. 
We got what we need. 
Mr. Mossman, 
I'm sorry we put you and your wife through this. 
It'll be safer for you to stay here now. 
Could you please let us out? 
Like to help if I can. 
I've come this far. 
We're gonna need to borrow your car a little longer. 
MOSSMAN: Sure, it's insured. 
Wait. There's someone inside. 
Mr. Mossman, get 
back in the vault now. 
Is there any other way out of here besides the front door? 
No, front door only security reasons. 
Damn it. 
Both of you stay here. 
I'll be right back. 
Henderson's men are taking up positions. 
There's no other way out-- we're gonna have to turn ourselves in. 
They didn't come here to arrest us; they came here to kill us. 
What are they waiting for? 
All the windows are bulletproof. 
They're waiting for us to leave the building. 
So what are you gonna do? 
How do you trip the silent alarm? 
I have a key, but you trip that alarm, LAPD will be here within a few minutes. 
That's exactly what I want. 
Henderson's men outnumber us. 
We leave this building now, we lose. 
Jack, if you call the cops, they're gonna get the recording when we're taken into custody. 
We won't be taken into custody. 
As soon as Henderson finds out the LAPD have arrived, he's gonna have his men engage them. 
He doesn't want the police to have the recording any more than he wants us to have it. 
So they start shooting at each other. 
How does that help us? 
We have to try and use that as a diversion. 
It's our only way out. 
Trigger the alarm. 
Be right back. 
Valerie. 
The feed should be coming through to your laptop now. 
I've got her. 
She's heading west on Chandler. 
How close are you to Audrey's car? 
About two miles. 
Close the gap to one mile. 
Affirmative. 
Something's wrong. 
The feed's breaking up. 
We're experiencing the same difficulty with our signal hold on. 
What's going on? 
I don't know. 
The satellite's positioned correctly. 
I'm tracing the corruption. 
It's the server. 
What is it? 
O'Brian's gone. 
* * What were you doing? 
What? 
What were you doing? 
Are you kidding? 
If you really want the details, I'll write you a report. 
Let's go, now. 
MOSSMAN: The police should be here any minute. 
Mr. Mossman, like I said before, 
it might be safer for you to stay here in the bank. 
No, these guys find me, they assume I know about the recording, they'd probably kill me, right? 
I'll take my chances with you. 
I want you to stay as close to Mr. Palmer as you can. 
I'll provide cover fire. 
Once we leave the bank, you break left. 
Yes, sir. 
Cooper, what's your status? 
No change, they still haven't come out. 
Must have seen you, damn it. 
Tell your men to move in immediately. 
The cops are here. 
We can't let them have Bauer; take 'em down. 
Yes, sir. 
This is LAPD! 
Drop your weapons! 
Engage! Engage! 
( heavy gunfire ) Let's go. 
( heavy gunfire continues ) ( gunfire continues ) ( rapid gunfire ) Need to go to the police car now-- move! 
( gunfire continues ) JACK: He's been hit! 
( tires screeching ) ( bullets ricocheting ) ( heavy gunfire continues ) How is he doing? 
He's dead. 
Damn it. 
( phone rings ) Jack, where are you? 
I'm on my way to you. 
Did your father agree to meet? 
Yes, he's landing at Van Nuys Airport in about 15 minutes. 
I'm there now. 
Good, we got the evidence. 
Have you listened to it? 
Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan. 
You understand what this means. 
We're talking about taking down the President of the United States. 
Captioning sponsored by 20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION and FORD. 
Built for the road ahead. 
We have waited patiently for you to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors, but we have heard nothing. 
This it the cost of that silence. 
If you choose to sign this corrupt document, understand that you will also be staining it with the blood of the remaining hostages. 
If CTU can't pull this off in time that's upwards of 60 people, Mike. 
Mrs. Logan, if someone 
altered the recording of your conversation with David Palmer, the president needs to know. 
Between the summit and the hostage situation, he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this. 
Until the treaty's signed, I'm not letting this out of my sight. 
What did she tell you? 
She said it was a transcript of the call she had with David Palmer. 
I under President Logan wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible. 
Yes, before the treaty is signed. 
Curtis, what's your situation? 
My men are in place, and we're setting the entry charges. 
We should be able to make our entry on target. 
I assume Mr. Bauer's 
been taken into custody? 
Well, I plan to debrief him here. 
Bring him in now. 
Diane, what's going on? 
What's wrong? 
Derek is inside the terminal. 
I see him. 
He's with the other hostages but he's not hurt. 
Please don't let anything happen to him. 
This is not your fault. 
I'm the reason you went along with them. 
This is not over. 
We got a problem. 
One of the hostages is missing. 
He was working with the terrorists. 
Give me a description; I'll take care of it. 
I'll help you now let's go. 
Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody. 
I watched Beresch give this guy a key card. 
Something else is going down here. 
We've got to find this guy now. 
Sorry we have to bring you in like this, Jack. 
It's all right, Mara. 
I understand. 
A year and a half. 
How did you manage to stay invisible for so long? 
Apparently I wasn't as invisible as I should have been. 
Tyler. 
Mara, it's Curtis. 
Put Bauer on. 
It's Agent Manning. 
Yeah? 
Jack, you say the suspect was hiding among the hostages? 
Yeah, right up until the assault began, somewhere around 10:30. 
Then he must have broken for an exit. 
What exit was closest? 
Without an alarm? 
Between gates six and seven. 
Thanks, Jack. 
Yeah. 
Pull up external video starting at 10:30. 
All cameras covering gates six and seven. 
We're away. 
Mrs. Logan? 
Mrs. Logan? 
Oh, my God. 
Help! 
Something's happened to the First Lady. 
Get a doctor, now. 
According to Jack, he should be between gates six and seven, just outside this view. 
I got this feed from ten minutes ago. 
Try camera seven. 
Camera four. 
All right, there he is. 
Tighten up. 
Yellow Tie. Got him. 
Now let's follow him. 
Damn it. What camera covers 
the adjacent sector? 
14A, but it's a bad angle. 
Pull it up, anyway. 
Match the time codes. 
Okay, here he is. 
This is two minutes, 25 seconds later. 
What hangar is that? 
Hangar Double-B. 
Has it been searched yet? 
No. It was outside 
the secured perimeter. 
All right, I'm going to take a field team, head over there. 
Send this info to Comm. 
Team A with me. 
Let's go! 
Hangar Double-B. 
Let's go. 
CTU. Stiles. 
Edgar, Jack told us about a suspect hiding among the hostages. 
We just picked up surveillance on him. 
He entered Hangar Double-B at roughly 10:57. 
Did you check it out yet? 
No, we're going in now. 
I'll need comm. 
I'm on it. Chloe, what volume 
is airport facilities on? 
Hennessy Four. 
Team Two, cover the rear. 
* * Check it out. 
Everyone else, search the building, see what you can find. 
* * Craig, it's Curtis. 
Send a forensics team down here now. 
Tell them they'll need a full bio-pack with spectrum analyzers. 
Any problems getting the canisters out? 
No. They were hidden exactly 
where you said they'd be. 
Everything on schedule with our transport? 
Customs documents are being finalized at the port. Good. 
The Russians will finally understand the consequences of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard. 
When did this happen? 
A few minutes ago. 
I came back in, and I found her on the bed. 
What do you mean "came back in"? 
You mean you left her alone. 
What happened, Doctor? 
Is she all right? 
She seems to be now, but I'd have to do some tests to find out why she blacked out. 
I didn't black out. 
Someone did this to me. 
Someone attacked me, Charles. 
Shh, shh. Martha... 
You have to do something. 
You have to do something. 
They're trying to get me. 
No, no one's trying to get you. Yes! 
We just want you to be well. Honey, listen. 
Listen, listen. 
I had the proof, and now it's gone. 
What proof? 
What are you talking about? 
The proof that David Palmer called me to warn me about today. 
Are we still on this? 
We've never been off of it. 
You just wouldn't listen to me. 
Sir. 
Is everything okay? 
I think so. 
No. No, damn it, 
it's not o... okay! 
You people have got to listen to me. 
I had a document, from the archive room. 
Where was this document? 
I am trying to tell you. 
It was hidden in my blouse. 
It's gone. 
Someone stole it from me. 
Martha, you've been under a lot of stress. 
We all have. 
Let... let... 
No, let Dr. Hill... 
Let Dr. Hill examine you 
and we can figure out how to get you better. 
You don't believe me. 
You don't believe your own wife. 
I have an important phone call from the Secretary of State that I have to get to. 
If there's any sudden changes, you get back to me as soon as possible. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Charles, don't leave. 
Honey, I'll be right down the hall. 
No, no, no, honey, honey, don't leave me. 
You need to get some rest. 
Ple... 
Close that door. 
What do I do about this, Walt? 
This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont. 
Are you suggesting that I readmit her? 
You have to consider the option. 
For her sake. 
She said she'd rather die than go back in there. 
Sir, if she's going to persist with these conspiracy theories, it's only a matter of time before she talks to someone who believes her. 
Then we really will have a problem. 
I wish you were wrong, but I don't think you are. 
Do you want me to handle this, sir? 
Make the arrangements. 
But don't let Martha find out. 
Let me be the one to tell her. 
Yes, sir. 
Yeah. 
Have you handled the problem there? 
Yes. 
Martha Logan won't be giving us any more trouble. 
Good. Erwich has just 
completed transferring the gas to the semi and is on his way to the port. 
And the authorities don't know anything's been stolen? 
Not yet. 
Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer. 
Where is he? 
On his way to CTU. 
Mm. He's getting too close. 
He's already started putting the pieces together. 
I know. 
He needs to be taken out. 
I'm handling it myself. 
How? 
Once he gets to CTU, your hitter won't be able to get near him. 
I've have someone on the inside who can help us. 
Then use him. 
Done. 
You sure those readings are right? 
They're right. 
2,000 parts per million. 
That can only be military grade. 
I'll tell him. 
Where are you going? 
I need you to finish the shell script. 
Not now. 
Since when do you say "not now"? 
According to this, the hangar was leased to some offshore company, but it's been vacant for at least 18 months. 
Sir? 
I just heard from Curtis. 
He was right. 
There was nerve gas in hangar Double B. 
That's what killed the rats. 
There were trace amounts found in the animals' blood. 
But the concentrations were definitely mil spec weaponized. 
So this man in the yellow tie, the suspect that Bauer's telling us about that's what he was doing at the airport? 
Stealing canisters of nerve gas out of the hangar? 
Stealing from whom? 
Military destroyed its stockpiles years ago. 
Well, maybe this nerve gas wasn't produced by the military. 
Edgar, have forensics get a signature off the trace samples. 
See if they can figure out who manufactured it. 
Chloe, elevate our alert status. 
Activate all available personnel and get Curtis back here. 
We're gonna need everyone we have. 
I wouldn't issue a statement about the First Lady for another couple days. 
Let your successes today run front and center on all the networks. 
That sounds right. 
Dr. Hill, please, come in. 
How's Martha doing? 
Well, she's asleep now. 
Have you figured out what caused the blackout? 
I spoke with her psychiatrist, Dr. Carlstrom, 
and none of the medication she's been prescribing would have caused this kind of collapse. 
So we still don't know what it was. 
Not yet, no. 
Mr. President, I need 
to speak to you and Walt alone. 
Thank you, Doctor. 
Keep a close eye on her. 
We'll talk soon. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
What's up, Mike? 
I'm afraid the situation at the airport has taken an unexpected turn. 
What's the problem? 
The hostages were saved, we've captured or killed all the terrorists. 
Not all of them. 
One of the terrorists was posing as a hostage. 
He used the hostage crisis to cover a theft. 
A theft? 
What was stolen? 
A cache of chemical weapons. 
What kind of chemical weapons? 
Nerve gas. 
Is it ours? 
No, sir. 
CTU is still trying to source it. 
But it was buried in a bunker at the airport. 
It seems this man had another crew waiting for him there. 
Do we have any idea what the terrorists are planning? 
Well, they haven't made any demands or issued any threats, yet. 
Well, what are we doing to stop them? 
CTU is running an interagency search effort. 
They're coordinating ground operations, filtering intelligence. 
Has the press found out about this, yet? 
No, sir. 
It's being kept internal. 
Whatever retaliation we were bracing for an hour ago is nothing compared to what these people are capable of doing now. 
Sir, I'll assemble the Homeland Security team to discuss evacuation scenarios. 
I sent everyone updates on the airport forensics. 
What did you want me on next? 
Check the task list. 
You don't need to ask me every time you need something new to do. 
I don't care if you are my boss or if you regret sleeping with me last night. 
No one talks to me like that. 
Really? 
I just did. 
Now, what's your problem? 
I don't have a problem. 
Then what do you want? 
Nothing. 
Edgar. 
Look, I'm sorry that my private life hasn't remained private today. 
I'm thinking the opposite. 
What do you mean? 
You're too private. 
We've known each other for years. 
And today I find out you're keeping secrets from me? 
Haven't you ever taken a psychology class? 
People keep secrets. 
I don't. 
Not from my friends. 
Why didn't you tell me Jack was alive? 
Oh, come on. 
It's called national security. 
Yeah, well, what about Spenser? 
I didn't even know you two were going out. 
Give me a break. 
Okay, when we find the nerve gas and the alert level drops, we can have some chamomile tea and I'll tell you all my secrets, okay? 
You paged me. 
Has Bauer arrived at CTU? 
No, not yet. 
When he does, I need you to do something. 
We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas. 
Bauer is a priority. 
I need you to clear an entrance into CTU. 
I'm sending it now. 
Okay. 
Miss Raines. 
I'll get back to you. Yes? 
I take it you're up to speed on the nerve gas stolen from the airport. 
I was just filling in DOD. 
Diane Huxley and her son were brought in to be debriefed. 
I'd like you to interview her. 
Interview her about what? 
Any information she has that could help us find the nerve gas. 
What could she possibly know about that? 
I've reviewed the evidence against Jack Bauer, and I'm inclined to agree with your assessment that he was framed for the assassination of David Palmer. 
Thank you. 
I also think that whoever framed Jack is also involved with the theft of this nerve gas. 
Which means that Diane Huxley could have had contact with that person without realizing it. 
I- I'm not a trained interrogator. 
But you know Jack Bauer better than anyone else in here. 
You have something in common with this woman. 
It might help her open up. 
I realize it's awkward, but I need you to do it. 
Fine. 
I'll see what I can get from her. 
Thank you. 
Where is she? 
She and her son just cleared security. 
Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines. 
Hi. 
Hello. 
This is my son, Derek. 
Hi. I'm gonna be asking you 
a few qutions. 
And Derek, I want you to be checked out by a doctor while I speak with your mother. 
There's nothing wrong with me. 
It's just procedure. 
When you're done, you and I will speak. 
Can you take him to medical, please? 
It's okay, I'll see you in a bit. 
Don't worry, he'll be fine. 
Is Jack gonna be here soon? 
He's on his way in. 
Come with me. 
I had no idea he worked in a place like this. 
It's just up these stairs. 
Did you know him before? 
Yes. 
I knew him. 
A lot of people here thought you were dead until today. 
Yeah, I know. 
Excuse me. 
Chloe. 
Hi, Jack. 
You all right? 
Yeah, I'm okay. 
We wouldn't have made it out of that airport without your help. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Mr. Bauer, Lynn McGill 
from division. 
Mara, I'll assume custody at this point, thank you. 
You're no longer a suspect in President Palmer's murder, but while you're here, you will need this. 
It'll give you level two clearance. Thank you. 
Was Agent Manning able to apprehend the suspect? 
No. 
It seems the person you identified used the hostage situation as a cover to steal a cache of weaponized nerve gas from the airport. 
Nerve gas? How do 
you know that? 
McGILL: Following your lead, Curtis found trace amounts in a hangar adjacent to the terminal. 
We don't know how much there is and where it came from, but it is a military grade chemical weapon. 
Do you have any leads? 
Not yet, but we're gonna run the search operation from here. 
You're not gonna be able to track these terrorists fast enough with a standard search operation. 
The only way you're gonna get that nerve gas in time is if you find out who ordered the hit on David Palmer. 
I agree. 
I think Palmer was about to expose this plot. 
I think that's why he was killed. 
I also think that if you can help us identify who framed you, we can intercept this nerve gas while there's still time. 
Hello, Jack. 
Hey, Bill. 
President's been informed of the nerve gas. 
He wants to ensure the media doesn't find out. 
Well, make sure Division restricts information flow. 
We'll continue this conversation when I'm done. 
Good to see you again, Jack. 
It's good to see you, too, Bill. 
I'm so sorry about Michelle. 
I never meant to put her in jeopardy. 
Of course, you didn't. 
How's Tony doing? 
He's still unconscious, but the doctor says he's going to pull through. 
Good. 
We're gonna need to speak to him as soon as possible. 
They know to call us. 
Jack... 
Audrey has been working for us. 
She's here in the building now? 
She's debriefing Diane Huxley. 
Why is she talking to Diane? 
Lynn asked her to. 
I'm not used to calling him Jack. 
He said his name was Frank Flynn. 
I thought he worked for the oil company. 
You probably know more about him than I do. 
We all thought he was dead for the last year and a half. 
So what do you want to know? 
You said that Jack was living with you for the last... 
six months, is that correct? 
He was renting a room. 
So, you don't have a personal relationship with him? 
I'm not sure that's any of your business. 
I'm sorry, I just... 
I need to know how close you and Jack were, whether he confided in you or not. 
Jack's a private person. 
I always knew he was keeping something from me. 
I just never pushed it. 
I accepted him for who he was. 
Ms. Raines... 
whoever he was before... 
it doesn't change the way I feel about him. 
He was good to me, he was good to my son. 
He meant a lot to us. 
He still does. 
I see. 
Did anyone ever come by and ask about Jack? 
What do you mean? 
Someone knew that Jack was alive. 
It's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was. 
No. No one asked about him. 
No one ever came to see him. 
Can you excuse me for a minute, please? 
Yeah. 
Jack. 
I don't even know where to begin. 
You have to believe me. 
I couldn't tell you I was still alive. 
Jack, you don't need to apologize. 
I did it for your own protection. 
It's been hard for me, thinking you died, believing that I was angry at you... 
that I hated you. 
I wasn't able to forgive myself for that. 
You had every reason to hate me. 
I was responsible for Paul's death. 
I lied to you. 
Jack. 
You made a hard decision. 
I never imagined I'd get another chance to tell you this. 
But I want... 
I want you to know that I don't blame you for what happened with Paul. 
Thank you. 
Jack... 
There's so much that I want to say to you, I know its... 
Mr. Bauer. 
Mr. Buchanan needs 
to see you. 
I'll be right down. 
I should go. 
Evelyn, is Mrs. Logan 
still asleep? 
Yes, she's finally getting some rest. 
Good. 
You should probably start gathering some of her things. 
I thought the president was staying through the weekend. 
He is... but she'll be 
leaving today. 
Where's she going? 
Just make sure she has the essentials to make her trip comfortable. 
Yes, sir. 
Edgar said he saw you come in here. 
What are you doing? 
Setting up a new socket. 
We're overloaded from the NSA database. 
Why are you here? 
Looking for you. 
What for? 
I need to get into your utilities volume. 
Why didn't you message me? 
Okay, I wanted to say something, too. 
Let's not make a big drama out of it. 
What? 
I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago. 
I didn't mean anything. 
All right. 
Apology accepted. 
It wasn't really an apology, it was more of an observation. 
I mean, the fact... 
Spenser. 
Damn it, why do I do that? 
It's Chloe. 
What is it? 
I need to know Spenser's clearance level? 
Why are you asking? 
Spenser works for me, and I need to know his clearance level, so could you please open the header file and give it to me, Edgar? 
Fine. 
Level three. 
Chloe? 
Call Buchanan, tell him I need to talk to him now. 
It's important. 
Division sent me. 
One of your mainframe servers is cycling slow. 
You're not on the manifest. 
I was told it'd be taken care of. 
I'm going to have to clear this with the systems administrator. 
Are you Hank, from on-site support? 
Yeah. 
My fault. 
I was supposed to advance him an emergency clearance. All right. 
Place the bag on the conveyor belt, and walk right through, sir. 
All clear. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
I'll show you the way. 
Mr. Cummings told me 
it would be best to keep you off the manifest. 
Classified material generally runs on servers nine and twelve. 
All the information you need on Bauer should be there. 
I don't know what files Mr. Cummings 
asked you to download, but you need to keep vector counts the same, or it'll get flagged. 
I got it. 
Okay. 
I need to get back to my station. 
Evelyn, what are you doing? 
Mrs. Logan, 
are you feeling better? 
Why are you packing my things? 
Walt Cummings asked me to. 
Why? 
Where are we going? 
I don't know if the president's going with you. 
Evelyn, stop. What's going on? 
They just asked me to get you ready to leave. 
They're sending me to Vermont, aren't they? 
Charles is having me committed. 
I'm sorry, Mrs. Logan. 
I honestly don't know anything else. 
It's fine. 
I'll getting dressed. 
Edgar, my FGA is locked. 
Where's Chloe? 
How should I know? 
Can you unlock this? 
No. 
Mr. Wolff? 
Please come with us. 
What do you want? 
Mr. Buchanan has ordered us 
to take you to him immediately. 
I'm in the middle of a critical task here. 
Mr. Stiles 
has been authorized to take over your work load. 
Did you know about this, Edgar? 
Yeah. I just got the bulletin. 
Sorry. 
Mr. Wolff. 
Please. 
I'm coming. 
Chloe? 
Sir. 
What is going on here? 
Sit down, Spenser. 
You've been burrowing into classified CTU protocols without authorization. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Stop- I know you were logged onto the security subsystem, where you had no right to be. 
We're going through your system so you might as well tell us now what you were doing. 
I told you I was opening... 
That's enough! 
You've accessed files outside your clearance level at least 18 times in the four months you've been here. 
Sir, whatever you think you've found, it's a mistake. 
I've done nothing wrong. 
Come on, Spenser, you obviously have your own agenda here. 
I don't have an "agenda." 
And while you're at it, why don't you explain why it was necessary to crawl into my bed. 
Which certainly wasn't what it appeared to be, just like your work here isn't what it appears to be! 
Chloe, Chloe. 
Chloe, let me handle this, please. 
Sir, obviously you can't take anything she says into consideration. 
I was careless. 
And, inadvertently, I caused her some emotional pain. 
Oh, please. 
And now she's trying to get back at me. 
I don't think so, Spenser. 
Sir, I'd like to talk to a lawyer. 
Forget about a lawyer! 
We're in the middle of a terrorist crisis There are lives on the line. 
You're going to tell us what you've been doing here, and you're going to tell us now. 
I hope this goes better than when I sent her up there the last time. 
Dr. Hill and his staff 
are on standby if she overreacts. 
I'm not looking forward to this. 
Evelyn? 
Mr. President. 
Where is she? 
She's in the bathroom, sir. 
Martha? 
Marty? 
Are you sure she's in there? 
Yes, sir. 
She's getting dressed. 
Marty? 
Aaron? 
My wife is gone. 
This is Pierce. 
We have a priority alert. 
The First Lady has left her quarters and is unaccounted for. 
All agents in the main wing, move to points north and west. 
Anyone spotting her, check in immediately. 
So the only people who knew you were alive were David Palmer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler and Chloe O'Brian. 
Yeah, and at least one other person who killed David Palmer and tried to frame me for it. 
And you don't know who that other person might be? 
No. 
Any theories? 
About a year and a half ago, David Palmer called me. 
Told me there's someone in Logan's administration targeting me. 
Which is why you faked your own death and assumed a new identity? 
Yeah, except it didn't work. 
I believe that whoever tried to kill me 18 months ago somehow found out I was still alive, and waited until today to exploit that information. 
Someone inside President Logan's administration? 
That's what David Palmer told me a year and a half ago, and I believe him. 
Well, first of all, that would mean someone in this administration is also tied to the theft of the nerve gas. 
Yeah. You're going 
to have to look into that. 
Well, even if you're right, there are hundreds of people in Logan's administration. 
It would take an investigation of that magnitude months to gain any traction and we don't have months to work with. 
WOMAN I'm sorry to interrupt, but Dr. Paulson is calling 
from medical. 
Put him through. 
DR. PAULSON 
Mr. McGill? 
Yes? 
Tony Almeida's regained consciousness and is in recovery. 
Can he talk? 
Yes. He's very weak, 
you'll have to be brief. 
Let him know I'll be down in a few minutes. 
Tony asked if be could speak to Jack Bauer first. 
He says it's important. 
He's a friend of mine. 
Tell Mr. Almeida that Jack 
will be down in few moments. 
I'll let him know. 
Thank you. 
I'll be right back. 
Jack. 
What's going on? 
I know you're busy. 
I... 
I just wanted to apologize. 
You have nothing to apologize for. 
Yes, I do. 
I thought you were just another loser, trying to take advantage of my mom. 
I was wrong. 
You were trying to protect her. 
Your mother is lucky to have someone who loves her as much as you do. 
As soon as this is over, I promise you, you and I are going to get a chance to sit down and talk. 
But right now I have to go. 
Yeah. 
Take care of your mother. 
Who gave you the Level Five authorization? 
Don't look at me. 
Answer him! 
I can't. 
I can't talk to anyone here about this. 
Whatever you were doing is over, Spenser. 
Sir, I was able to pull Spenser's screen activity from the archive. 
This is what he was looking at ten minutes ago. 
Looks like he was using in-house surveillance to track someone through CTU. 
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer? 
What the hell's going on here, Spenser? I 
was following orders. 
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason. 
Who is they? 
I won't say anything else. 
Chloe, find security, have them locate Jack now. 
Dr. Paulson? 
Yes. 
I'm Jack Bauer. 
Tony Almeida wanted to speak with me. 
Oh, of course, Mr. Bauer. 
Just remember to please keep it brief. 
Thank you, sir. 
Tony. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
Jack, you all right? 
I think he cracked my rib. 
I've been trying to reach you, but the lines were locked out. 
What happened? 
Who is he? 
I don't know, but he's a professional. 
He killed Dr. Paulson, 
then he tried to kill me. 
You have any idea how he got into CTU? 
We identified a mole working in Chloe's department. 
Who? 
Spenser Wolff. 
We've been interrogating him, but he hasn't talked yet. 
Where is he? 
Holding. 
Get a doctor down here to monitor Tony Almeida now. 
Lock this room down. 
Contact Lynn McGill, have him meet me in Holding. 
Bring up visual surveillance on Medical Room Two. 
Open the door. 
Get up! 
Did you let that man into CTU? 
This man is a professional assassin. 
He just killed Dr. Paulson, 
and he tried to kill me. 
Did you let him into CTU? 
No. They told me he was here 
to place a tap on one of the servers. 
That's all I knew. 
Who told you? 
I was here as part of an Internal Affairs investigation. 
Are you starting to understand how much trouble you are in? 
Now, I'm gonna give you one more chance. 
Who told you to let that man into CTU? 
The White House. 
Mr. Cummings 
in the White House. 
Cummings recruited me after I started working here. 
He said that they wanted to make sure CTU was operating... 
within the rules. 
You have to believe me. 
I thought I was serving the President. 
Yeah. Take him back 
to Holding. 
Walt Cummings killed David Palmer, and he tried to have me killed. 
Even if it is true, we have to build a case before we call the President. 
We don't call the President. 
He's here in California. 
We go see him now. 
Cummings is the President's Chief of Staff, Jack. 
And his friend. 
Without any hard evidence, CTU can't touch him. 
I'm not CTU. 
I'll go get Walt Cummings myself. 
You're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office. 
Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much. 
Logan had more to protect, and you know that. 
Aaron? 
Ma'am, please stay where you are. 
( gunshot ) Bierko's escaped. 
What? 
How long ago? 
Davis, Karen Hayes here. 
What happened? 
Our lead car got taken out by an IED. 
I overheard Bierko talking to his men. 
He said they're not finished. 
I'm sure he said something about a nerve gas canister. 
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with. 
Trust me. 
You're wasting your time. 
He's not going to help us. 
He will if we offer him a deal. 
What do you want? 
I'll disappear just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese. 
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate, this deal is off. 
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon. 
We need to know where. 
CHLOE: It's a Russian submarine, Jack. 
What is the armament package on a Russian Delta-4 class sub? 
Best of my knowledge, 12 Scorpion land-attack missiles. 
They're fast and accurate, carry multiple warheads. 
One of them can take out several city blocks. 
Lieutenant, we believe the Natalia has been targeted for a terrorist attack. 
We think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub. 
You need to secure your vessel and lock down your weapons system immediately. 
We have control of the weapons system. 
Vertical tubes are loaded and ready. 
I've flushed the Sentox. 
The atmospheric readings are all normal. 
It's safe to breathe. 
The coordinates for the targets upload them into the missiles. 
Begin the launch countdown. 
Remove your masks. 
We are close to finishing what we started today. 
I have identified 12 high-value targets: financial centers, transportation hubs, high-population-density areas. 
The Americans will wake up this morning to discover how steep a price they've paid for their alliance with Moscow. 
What we're about to accomplish today will be remembered by our countrymen forever. 
( typing ) Ms. Raines. 
Admiral Kirkland. 
I understand you're reporting some type of emergency at the Port of Los Angeles? 
In anticipation of today's treaty with the Russians, the Russian submarine Natalia is docked here for inspection by the U.S. Navy. 
I'm familiar with the exercise. 
I authorized it myself. 
Terrorists have seized control of that submarine. 
What? We haven't received any 
distress signals from the crew. 
Because they're dead, sir, all of them, including the Russian crew. 
We believe the terrorists have flooded the sub's ventilation system with Sentox nerve gas. 
My God. 
Sir, I don't mean to preempt your protocols, but how long will it take you to scramble a flight of F-18s? 
You're asking me to sink the submarine? 
Sir, these terrorists are in control of 12 multiple-warhead missiles, which they will use against civilian targets unless we stop them first. 
I'll need all of this confirmed. 
We have a team on the ground that can confirm, but now I need to know precisely: How long will it take for you to scramble these fighters? 
I'm sending you the estimated approach vectors and ETA for my F-18s. 
I can have my fighter jets there within 22 to 25 minutes. 
We have a problem, sir. 
According to our simulation, Bierko will have his missiles in the air in less than 20 minutes. 
Scrambling the jets right now, but it seems to me as if this is going to be up to your team on the ground. 
We have visual contact with the sub. 
Hatches are still closed. 
Ship's been locked down. 
Confirming one hostile topside, standing guard. 
Jack, Chloe's simulation has Bierko firing those missiles in less than 20 minutes. 
Sooner than that if he's already started programming targets. 
The Navy won't be able to intercept in time. 
Jack, it's Audrey. 
I just got off the phone with Admiral Kirkland. 
He's scrambling F-18s, but they won't be able to get them in the air in time in order to destroy the sub. 
How far out are reinforcements? 
Too far. 
Additional tac teams won't arrive until after the missiles have launched. 
That means we have to take Bierko down ourselves. 
That's not a real option, Jack. 
There are only four entry points on that submarine. 
We have to assume that Bierko's locked them down and is defending them. 
AUDREY: Jack, Bill's right. 
We don't have the manpower or the resources to get on that sub. 
We might. 
Somebody just launched a signal tube off the starboard side. 
What's a signal tube? 
It's a radio beacon crewmen can send to the surface in case of emergencies. 
Chloe, if there are friendlies inside, they can help us board the sub. 
I want you to scan all emergency frequencies. 
On it. 
Standing by. 
Jack, just so we're straight we stop Bierko, my wife and I disappear for good, with your help, right? 
Yeah. 
One other thing. 
If I'm going on that sub with you, I need a firearm. 
I'll cover you. 
Well, that's what I'm worried about. 
I don't go anywhere undefended against hostiles. 
I still consider you a hostile. 
Jack, I don't get a gun, I don't go in. 
CHLOE: Jack, you were right. 
There's a survivor on the submarine. He's sending 
out a distress signal. 
Can he receive on this frequency? 
Yeah. 
Patch him through. 
MAN: I repeat. Petty Officer 
Tim Rooney, on Natalia K524. 
Code seven. SOS. 
We are under attack. 
Petty Officer Rooney, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm with the Counterterrorist Unit, Los Angeles. 
What the hell is going on, sir? 
Everyone's dead. 
And there are people in the Control Room trying to operate the missile launch system. 
Who the hell are they? 
They're Russian separatists. 
They're the terrorists that were responsible for the attacks that took place earlier today. 
Does the Navy know about this? 
Yeah. They're sending 
in fighters, but I don't think they're going to get here in time. 
So what are we supposed to do? 
Did anyone else from your crew survive the attack? 
No. I don't think so. 
Where are you? 
Lower Level, Auxiliary Engineering. 
I was down here doing an inventory when the alarms went off. 
The atmospheric gauges red-lined. 
It's a sealed compartment, so I shut it down. 
The men that attacked the ship, were they wearing gas masks? 
They were, but they took them off a few minutes ago. 
Okay, good. 
That means they flushed the Sentox out of the air system. 
You should be able to move around freely. 
Hold on one second. 
Chloe? 
Yes, Jack? 
I want you to get me the nearest entry point to Petty Officer Rooney's current position. 
The closest hatch is the forward escape hatch. 
Copy that. 
Petty Officer Rooney, do you have a firearm? 
No. The armory's 
on the other side of the ship. 
You need to find something that you can use as a weapon. 
I have a... I have 
a utility tool. 
It has a knife on it. 
That'll work. 
I want you to make your way up to the Upper Level. 
Let me know when you get there. 
You still haven't told me what it is you want me to do. 
I need you to get to the forward escape hatch and let us in. 
There's a man there guarding it. 
Then you're going to have to kill him. 
Petty Officer Rooney? 
I'm an engineer. 
I... I'm not trained for that. 
The men that commandeered the Natalia plan to use its missiles and launch them on civilian targets unless we stop them. 
You need to make your way up to the Upper Level. 
You need to do it now. 
We are running out of time. 
I'll contact you when I get there. 
Copy that. 
We need to get closer to the sub. Are you ready? 
Jack, I know you got Malina's .45 in that bag. 
Now, give it to me. 
Let's go. 
We're generating a list of potential targets, but frankly, we have no idea what Bierko plans to hit. 
Are we evacuating these potential targets? 
Don't have time. The missiles 
will strike before we can mobilize even small numbers of people to the safe zones. 
How could this happen, Mike? 
How could these people even access a submarine in the first place? 
The sub was attacked when it was being serviced at a civilian port, not on a Naval base where security would have been more substantial. 
There has to be a way to destroy that sub before Bierko can launch those missiles. 
F-18s are scrambling as we speak. 
According to the latest estimates, they're not going to get there in time. 
AARON: Yes? 
I'm still waiting to talk to Mike Novick. 
He's in some kind of crisis meeting. 
There's no telling how long he'll be. 
Then I should try to get off the ranch on my own. 
No. Without Mike's help, 
you'll be seen. 
Charles can't find out you're still alive. 
I'll call you as soon as I get ahold of Mike. 
Okay. 
Jack, the missiles will launch in less than ten minutes. 
Copy that. 
How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence? 
I won't know for certain until I see how the targeting software is configured. 
Jack, the Petty Officer is coming back on. 
Patch him through. 
Petty Officer Rooney, you're on with Jack Bauer. 
JACK: What's your position, son? 
I'm 30 feet forward of the hatch. 
Have you got a visual of the hostile guarding the hatch? 
Yeah. He's still there. 
What do you want me to do? 
You need to kill him without alerting the others. 
Are you right-handed or left-handed? 
I'm right-handed. 
I want you to approach him from behind. 
When you're within 18 inches, I want you to take your left hand, put it on his mouth, pull his head back into your chest exposing his neck. 
Then I want you to take your right hand and slit his throat. 
I... I don't, uh... 
I don't know if I can do this. 
You don't have a choice, son. 
I want you to visualize the hostile down on the ground, dead. 
You cannot afford to think about this, son. 
You need to do it. 
Jack, there's less than six minutes until the missile launch. 
Petty Officer Rooney? 
Petty Officer Rooney? 
Okay, I can do this. 
I have to do this. 
Cut him deep, and cut him fast. 
Agent McCullough, cover us. 
We're moving in on the tower. 
Go. 
Petty Officer Rooney, what is your status? 
My status is, uh... 
He's dead. 
Did anyone hear you? 
No, no one's coming. 
Good. Open the hatch. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
I'll take out the guard. 
Let's go. 
All right, he's down. 
We're going in. 
Oh, no. 
The sub's missile hatches just opened. 
I see them. 
What does that mean in terms of our time frame? 
You have less than four minutes until they launch. 
Are you all right? 
I'm okay. 
Which way is the control room? 
It's down that hall. 
You lead, we'll follow. 
Okay. 
All right, the control room's right down that hall. 
BAUER: I'm going to need your help drawing the rest of the hostiles out of the con. 
What do you want me to do? 
Is there another way for you to get to the other side of the control room? 
Yeah, I can go down one level and then come up behind them. 
Okay, when you get there, I want you to create a diversion, something loud. 
Just make sure you get them out of there. 
When you do, I want you to find somewhere to lay low and stay there. 
I do not want you to engage them. 
Do you understand me? 
Yeah, I can do that. 
Go. 
With the last three missiles, make sure you overlap these populations centers in San Francisco. 
Locking up GPS coordinates, sir. 
Keep working. 
Did you hear that? 
Yes, sir. 
Down there. 
Come with me, both of you. 
The control room's right behind us. 
I have a visual on one hostile. 
Agent McCullough, I'm going to move into position. 
When he's directly above me, signal me with the mirror. 
CHLOE: Jack, the missiles are armed. 
Three minutes to launch. 
We're all clear. 
Jack, I'm gonna have to manually reverse all these codes. 
Do you have enough time? 
I'll do my best. 
I don't want to be in here any more than you if those F-18s take out this sub. 
We're going to keep Bierko and his men out of here so you can finish this. 
Let's go. 
( yells ) Agent McCullough's down. 
Bierko and one hostile remaining. 
Henderson, what is your status? 
Jack, I need more time. 
You've got to hold them off. 
60 seconds until they launch. 
( groaning ) Jack? 
Hang on, Jack. 
CHLOE: 30 seconds to launch. 
( screaming ) It's almost there, Jack. 
Four more seconds. 
CHLOE: Ten seconds. 
It's done. 
( bones cracking ) HENDERSON: The launch sequence is canceled. 
I repeat, the launch sequence is canceled. 
Audrey, recall the F-18's. 
I'm on it. 
Bierko's dead. 
The submarine is secure. 
HENDERSON: Jack, are you okay? 
Bill, I'm fine. 
I'm getting a lot of feedback. 
Take me off the com. 
Hold it, Jack. 
Now lower your arms real slow and turn around. 
You were never really going to let me go, were you? 
No. 
( clicks ) Good for you, Jack. 
You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer, Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler. 
They were friends of mine. 
That's the way it works. 
Identify yourself! 
My name is Jack Bauer, with the Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles! 
All the hostiles are dead! 
Holster your weapons! 
Sir, you need to contact Bill Buchanan-- immediately. 
Okay. Lieutenant, I need 
access to a vehicle. 
Petty Officer, get me a vehicle-- now! 
Thank you. 
BUCHANAN: Jack? 
Yeah. 
I've been told the Navy's running cleanup and security on the sub. 
Yeah, they're here now. 
Bill, Christopher Henderson is dead. 
What? What happened? 
He fired on me. 
I didn't have a choice. 
Are you coming back to CTU? 
Yeah, I'll be there soon. 
All right, we'll see you then. 
Chloe, the Navy needs our access codes to our logs so they can use them for their report. 
Can you pick up? 
Yeah. 
What codes do they need? 
They don't. Get somewhere 
where you won't be overheard. 
I'll have to get that from my screen. 
Let me get back to my station. 
I'm here. 
What's going on? 
I'm not coming back to CTU. 
I'm going after Logan. 
What do you mean, going after Logan? 
I'll fill you in on the details later. 
Right now I need you to walk me through modifying some field communications equipment. 
That's not exactly my area, Jack. 
Then you'll need to get some help. 
Chloe, are you with me on this? 
Yeah. What do you need? 
Hold on, I'll give you a list. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
We're certain the missiles no longer pose a threat? 
Yes, Mr. President. 
We have complete control over the boat. 
Vladimir Bierko and all his known associates are dead or in custody. 
So then it's all over, Mike. 
It's over. 
( sighs ) I need to make a statement before I go back to Washington. 
About the successful resolution of the crisis. 
Yes. 
And about David Palmer. 
Sir? 
David's casket is being flown to Arlington for burial, and I would like to say a few words alongside it at the airfield, and then I'll fly back to Washington. 
I'll get to work on it right away. 
Good. Thank you, Mike. 
For everything. 
It's been a hell of a day. 
Yes, sir. 
It has. 
Mike. 
You need to come with me. 
Come with you? 
Please. 
Oh, please. 
Mrs. Logan, 
have you been...? 
No. 
I've never been more sober. 
Or more sane. 
What's this about? 
My husband. 
What about him? 
Mike, I know you've been troubled by Charles's actions today. 
You know that something is terribly, terribly wrong. 
You just can't put your finger on it. 
Okay. 
Tell me what this is about. 
No, I'm going to show you. 
It'll explain everything. 
Please come. 
The mission to retake the submarine has been successful. 
Hmm, so I understand. 
You'll also be interested to know Christopher Henderson was killed during the operation. 
You're certain of this? 
CTU has confirmed the information. 
That's excellent. 
But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that's the end of all our problems. 
There's still Bauer to deal with. 
Don't worry. 
Mr. Bauer will 
be taken care of. 
Good. 
Mike. Over here. 
Aaron... 
What happened to you? 
Agent Adams tried to kill me. 
On the president's orders. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
Where is Agent Adams? 
Mike, we need your help. 
God. 
What the hell's going on here? 
The president had something to do with this? 
Everything. 
He was involved with everything that happened today supplying the terrorists with the nerve gas, the murder of David Palmer. 
( sighs ) But Walt Cummings? 
Walt was just their scapegoat. 
He didn't commit suicide. 
He was murdered by a man who works for Charles. 
Charles told me to be quiet. 
For the good of the country. 
Keep my mouth shut. 
I can't do that. 
Not anymore. 
Do you have proof? 
Jack Bauer was in possession of a recording that implicated the president. 
That's why Logan was willing to go so far as to shoot a plane full of people down because Jack was on it. 
Well, where is this recording? 
It's been destroyed. 
I didn't want to believe it either, Mike, but it's the truth, so help me God. 
All right. 
If this is true, we need to find another way to make a case against the president. 
You're right, but first we have to get Aaron off the ranch. 
There can't be a record of it. 
All right. You're right. 
We need to move fast. 
I know the men at the Western Gate well. 
They won't stop and inspect the vehicle if I'm driving. 
You'll hide in the back out of sight. 
Thank you, Mike. 
Give me the keys. 
Aaron. 
I'll be fine. 
I'll go somewhere where your husband's people can't find me. 
But will you let me know that you're all right? 
It's probably safer if we don't have any contact. 
Good-bye, Aaron. 
Thank you. 
Mike Novick. 
Mike, it's Jack Bauer. 
I know this is an unusual request, but I'm looking for Aaron Pierce. 
I've been trying to reach him on his cell, but he's not answering. 
It's Jack Bauer. 
He's trying to find you. 
Can you put him on speaker? 
Aaron's with me right now, Jack. Hold on. 
It's all right, Jack. You can 
speak freely in front of Mike. 
He knows what I know. 
Aaron, where are you? 
A few miles from the ranch. 
What happened? 
The president tried to have me killed, but Mrs. Logan 
saved my life. 
She and I both decided to bring Mike into this. 
And I'm still trying to process everything they told me. 
This is a real mess, Jack. 
Mike, I'm calling Aaron because I need his help. 
I need yours, too. 
Help with what? 
Bringing President Logan to justice. 
Well, Aaron said the recording you had implicating the president was destroyed. Is that true? 
Yes. 
Well, without it you can't mount a case. 
I can if I can get a direct confession from Logan. 
I'm working with someone inside CTU. 
They're setting up a digital uplink. 
If I can get Logan to acknowledge everything that he's done today, it's going to be all the evidence we need. 
Jack, if you intend to physically coerce the president of the United States... 
Mike, we need to do this now. 
The longer we wait, the more vulnerable we are. 
President Logan tried to take me out, just like he did Aaron. 
I don't need to remind you that he was responsible for David Palmer's assassination and a terrorist attack on this country's soil. 
He cannot be allowed to remain in office, not for one more day. 
How long will it take you to get here? 
20 minutes. 
That's too late. 
President Logan will be gone. 
He's leaving for Washington around that time. 
Then you have to try and delay him. 
I'm not sure I can do that. 
Mike, just tell me you'll try. 
All right. 
But get here as fast as you can. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Yes, sir. I'll get on a plane 
as soon as I finish our debrief with the Navy. 
Homeland's ordered me to Washington as soon as I file the Bierko case. 
Apparently, the request came from the White House. 
Logan's looking for an excuse to clean house. 
I'm sure I'll be next. 
HAYES: Come in. 
Yes, Chloe. 
Do you have something? 
I need an authorization code. 
For what? 
I need access to a high-clearance workstation. 
You already have access. 
It's for some new personnel. 
What? 
Morris? 
You're bringing Morris back? 
Yes. 
Why, Chloe? 
Because I'm still trying to salvage something from the recording that Miles erased. 
If anyone can do it, it's Morris. 
I didn't think Morris was even on the government payroll anymore. 
He's not. 
What's he doing? 
He's selling women's shoes in Beverly Hills. 
What? 
Is this a joke? 
No. You know I wouldn't 
have brought him in if there was anyone else I could call. 
Please, Mr. Buchanan. 
Thank you. 
Bill... 
It's going to be all right. 
Who is this guy? 
Morris O'Brian. 
Chloe's ex-husband. 
No, no, not like that. 
May I? 
See, the beauty of the beast is if you leave these fields blank, it'll prompt you for a code. 
Ba-bing. See that? 
You just saved 60 seconds. 
Ten of those a day, that's an extra cigarette break or whatever it is you do to take the edge off. 
Morris. 
What are you doing? 
Just making your people more efficient. 
I noticed you picked the most attractive one. 
Wrong. You're the most 
attractive one. 
Here's your clearance. 
I'm surprised you got Bill Buchanan to sign off on me. 
You know, this is a really good opportunity for you. 
Why don't you surprise me and not totally screw it up? 
Okay. 
I'm going to pretend that this will require all my focus and attention, even though we both know I can do it in my sleep. 
Sit down. 
So where is this recording you want me to resurrect? 
Nothing. Forget it. 
It's fried. 
I'm missing something. 
You said you wanted me to salvage a digital recording. 
That was an excuse. 
I need some comm unit modifications. 
I need a certified digital audio transfer rate of 6.8. 
I can only get to 6.5. 
Can you do that without talking? 
I could, but it'd be a terrible waste of my charm. 
Okay. I'm not 
listening anymore. 
Call me when you're done. 
Thanks. 
Behind me, you can see preparations as the casket bearing the body of David Palmer is due here shortly. 
It will be met by President Logan who is scheduled ( knock on door ) to make a statement before he flies back to Washington... 
Is Aaron safe? 
Yes. 
Thank God. 
I can't believe Charles is going to do this. 
He has David's blood on his hand, he has the audacity to eulogize him in front of the whole world. 
Mrs. Logan... 
I said earlier there was no way to make a case against your husband. 
I was wrong. 
Jack Bauer, the former CTU agent, contacted Aaron and me. 
He's on his way here now. 
What for? 
He's going to confront your husband directly. 
Confront him? 
What's he going to do? 
Jack Bauer will do whatever it takes to compel your husband to confess the truth. 
He's the only one I know who can do this. 
When will he be here? 
15 minutes. 
But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately. 
I know, I know, I tried to delay him myself, but he wouldn't change his schedule. 
That's why I'm coming to you. 
I need you to keep him here. 
Martha... 
if you want your husband brought to justice, this is our only chance. 
You have to find a way to stall him. 
Aaron, it's good to see you. 
Same here, Jack. 
Was Mike able to delay the President? 
He's trying. 
But he had to ask Mrs. Logan for some help. 
The First Lady knows what we intend to do? 
She does. 
Aaron... 
can she be trusted? 
She is with us, Jack... 
100%. 
Can you still get access to the Secret Service deployment grid? 
I already have. 
The way security has been beefed up around the main building, there's no way you're going to be able to get Logan alone there. 
Is Marine One taking him to the airfield? 
No, this was last minute. 
They're transporting him by reduced detachment. 
They're using a Navy helicopter. 
That's where this has to happen. 
I need to get on that chopper. 
I don't see how that's going to be possible. 
Aaron, you get me as close to that helicopter as you can and then we'll figure it out from there. 
All right. 
Let's go. 
Yes, I agree, Wayne Palmer should be at the airfield. 
But if you can't find him, I'm not going to wait for him. 
Yes, I'm leaving now. 
Have a copy of my speech on the chopper, and I'll work on it on the flight over. 
I'll be out of your way in a second. 
I saw on your schedule that you're meeting David Palmer's casket at the airfield. 
If you came here to judge me, Martha, I really don't have time... 
No, no. 
That's not it. 
I've had time to reflect and I... 
I think I owe you an apology. 
All right. 
I said some horrible things to you. 
I've had horrible things said to me before... 
and by you. 
But there was one thing you said that I can't get over. 
What? 
That I broke your heart... 
and that you hated me. 
Well, I wish I could take those words back. 
All I can ask now is that you forgive me. 
Please, Charles... 
I don't know how to respond, Marty. 
I never expected you to say anything like this. 
I mean it, Charles, I... 
I mean it, I need you to forgive me. 
You mean it now, but you know how you are. 
By tomorrow, I could be the man you hate again. 
I know. 
It'll take time for me to prove myself to you, but the truth is... 
even though sometimes I don't understand you, I still need you. 
And I still love you. 
And that will never change, Charles. 
Not tomorrow, not ever. 
I need you, too, Marty. 
Fly with me to Washington. 
We can spend some time together. 
On a plane surrounded by Secret Service? 
Why can't we just spend a little more time here, together, alone? 
You know that's not possible. 
I have to go. 
I had to go five minutes ago. 
Okay, Charles. 
You go. 
Come with me. 
I have a better idea. 
There's a helicopter waiting for me. 
Let it wait. 
I can't. 
Yes, you can. 
You're the President. 
Tell the helicopter to stand by. 
Yes. 
Until I'm ready. 
And make sure I'm not disturbed. 
It's clear. 
( cell phone rings ) Yeah. 
The President just notified Secret Service he's going to be delayed. 
How long? 
He didn't say. 
But Mrs. Logan knows we need 
as much time as possible. 
Jack... 
if Logan doesn't confess, how far are you actually willing to go? 
As far as I have to. 
I'm issuing an executive order, imposing a curfew on all civilians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. 
This curfew will be effective immediately and will be enforced by the military. 
They're talking about this like it's an illegal action. 
Don't worry, Mr. President. 
I'm in control of the situation. 
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall? 
Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country. 
There's going to be a fallout. 
And you know it. 
You're here to shut this place down, aren't you? 
I told you before, the White House... 
I know what you told me before. 
Now tell me the truth. 
CTU is being absorbed by Homeland, which means from now on, every operational decision needs to go through me. 
There's something from my brother I need to give you personally. 
I should be there within the hour. 
You coming here? 
I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron, but I'd rather see you sooner than later. 
I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly. 
( tires squealing ) ( tires squealing ) Does she have the schematics and the access codes? 
Yes. Everything 
we need. 
Release the Sentox here... 
and 200,000 people die. 
The decryption key is Charlie-Alpha 3-9-Alpha. 
It worked. 
This is what you wanted. 
JACK: Drop the gun! 
I'm with the German Federal Intelligence Service. 
I've been undercover for the last six months, gathering intel on Collette's clientele. 
If we don't find Bierko, hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die here today. 
JACK: Let him go! 
He's given us what we want! 
Put your hands up! 
As for the data I sold to Bierko, it's something that I received from a contact from the Department of Defense. 
What's his name? 
Her name? 
Audrey Raines. 
You were lying to me. 
She sold me the information, Mr. Bauer. 
Apparently, she had a price. 
Chloe, I need you to do something for me right away. 
Check out Audrey Raines's activities in the last 18 months. 
Audrey? Why? 
I'll explain later. 
I'm particularly interested in any unusual connection between her and Christopher Henderson or Walt Cummings. 
You think she has something to do with their conspiracy? 
I don't know what to think. 
Please do it quickly. 
Audrey. 
Yes, sir? 
I'm afraid I have to take you into custody. 
What? I don't understand. 
Am I being arrested? 
Detained. 
On what grounds? 
Collette Stenger's been passing information to Bierko, information he apparently intends to use in his next attack. 
She claims she got the information from someone at DoD, and she named you as the source. 
She's lying. 
That's impossible. 
We already uncovered one mole in the White House today, Audrey. 
I have no choice. 
What kind of information did Stenger say I gave her? 
I've told you as much as I can at this point. 
Prep Ms. Raines 
for interrogation. 
Does Jack know that I'm being detained? 
Yes. 
He sanctioned it. 
COLLETTE: It's the truth. 
Audrey Raines was my contact at the Department of Defense. 
You met with her face-to-face? 
Yes. 
Good, then you'll be able to recognize her when you see her. 
Of course. 
CTU AGENT: She identified Ms. Raines 
from photographs on the way here. 
If you were lying to me, I'm gonna make this the worst day of your life. 
You understand? 
Put her in Holding. 
Burke's interrogation methods should only be used as a last resort. 
The situation warrants a more aggressive approach. 
Then do the same thing to Collette Stenger. 
Stenger is protected by an immunity agreement. 
We can't touch her unless the information she's provided turns out to be false; then we can nullify the agreement. 
So we can torture our own people, but we can't touch a criminal? 
I've known Audrey Raines for years. 
I trust her implicitly. 
So does everyone else. 
Maybe that's the problem. 
Bill, we don't have the luxury of time. 
Intel indicates that an attack is imminent within an hour. 
Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Americans are at risk, and we just got information that Audrey Raines knows about it. 
Karen, the decision is yours. 
But any adverse consequences that result from insufficiently aggressive action taken now will come down hard on you. 
What is Agent Burke doing here? 
KAREN: We're talking about authorizing the medical interrogation. 
On Audrey? 
Yes. 
That's ridiculous. 
I'll handle the interrogation. 
I can't allow that. 
Karen, I brought this to you. 
I called it in. 
You can't pull me off of this now. 
Your emotional involvement with Ms. Raines 
is not exactly a secret, Jack. 
That has nothing to do with this. 
That's right. 
You always put the work first. 
You never let your feelings get involved. 
Is that what happened with Nina Myers? 
Nina Myers was a mistake I've never denied that but she was deep cover for years before I even met her. 
She fooled a lot of people for a long time, not just me. 
Well, maybe Audrey is fooling people, too. 
You might be right, Karen, but if I were you, I would think twice about who you're willing to invasively interrogate. 
Audrey Raines is the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense, James Heller, who happens to be her father! 
And if you were wrong, he's gonna eat you alive. 
At least let Jack talk to her for ten minutes first. 
She deserves that much. 
If she's guilty... 
she doesn't deserve anything. 
That's the point. 
She hasn't been proven guilty. 
After she's been prepped, you can see her for ten minutes. 
But at the first sign you're less than objective, you're out. 
Understood. 
Thanks, Bill. 
I don't believe Audrey is guilty of anything, Jack. 
Neither do I. 
The one thing we do know is, Bierko is going to release the Sentox in the city sometime in the next hour. 
If Audrey knows anything that can help us find him, she needs to tell us now. 
Keep an eye on the traffic patrol. 
Bierko's gonna need to move those canisters. 
He's gonna need transportation. 
With the curfew in place, I might get lucky and pick up a trail. 
Yeah. 
( man groans ) ( siren whoops ) ( grunts and groans ) ( scuffling ) Hey, break it up! 
( man groans ) OFFICER: Break it up now! 
Gentlemen, I said, break it up! 
( gunshot ) Take their uniforms and weapons. 
Now we have a police escort to the target, the curfew won't be a problem. 
( whispering ): Chloe, walk with me. 
You were doing background on Audrey? 
Yeah. 
What have you got? 
You're not going to like it. 
I found the connection between Walt Cummings and Audrey. 
What kind of a connection? 
They dealt with each other a few times the usual stuff between DoD and the White House. 
But there is something else. 
What? 
Chloe, what? 
They both stayed at a place called the River Hotel in Pikesville, Maryland, last April. 
So? 
So, Pikesville isn't exactly a hot spot with top-ranking federal officials. 
It wasn't a coincidence that they were there the same night. 
Chloe, what are you trying to say? 
They didn't just stay in the same hotel, but they stayed in the same room. 
How could you possibly know that? 
Because I e-mailed photos of them to the manager. 
He recognized them both. 
He showed me phone bills, room service receipts. 
I can show you a few if you want. 
No. I'm sorry. 
I believe you. 
It doesn't mean she was part of their conspiracy, but it doesn't exactly look that good either. 
Make copies of everything you've got and put them in a folder for me. 
Thanks. 
Excuse me. 
My name is Shari Rothenberg. 
I work in Section Five downstairs. 
I know where Section Five is. 
Right. Uh, Mr. Buchanan told me 
to report to Chloe O'Brian. 
Is that you? 
You're gonna have to wait a second. 
Um, I'm here to replace Edgar. 
I understand he died in the attack. 
Yes, he did. 
Well, if he was a friend of yours, I'm sorry. 
( sighs ) Thanks. 
He worked at Station Six. 
It's right there. 
Are you familiar with the Gavilan matrix analyzer? 
Yes, I am. 
Use it to make sure our databases are current. 
Some of them may have fallen behind in the past couple of hours. 
No problem. 
( sighs ) ( phone ringing musical tones ) Jack. 
Sit down. 
Sit down. 
That's the dossier you gave me on Collette Stenger. 
She says that you provided her with information from the DoD. 
I know. Bill told me. 
That's ridiculous. 
You know it. 
Jack, you're wasting time that we don't have. 
I had to ask CTU so that I could interrogate you. 
I have a job to do. 
If I don't do it, Burke will, and I promise you, you do not want to see him walk through that door. 
Fine. 
What kind of information did she say I gave her? 
She said you provided her with a structural schematic of Bierko's next target. 
What kind of structure? 
She didn't know. 
She just delivered the package. 
She claims that I gave her information, yet she can't tell you what that information is, and that's enough to make me a suspect?! 
Damn it, Audrey! You know 
what this nerve gas does? 
They are planning another attack. 
We will not ignore any leads. 
I have nothing to do with these terrorists. 
How did Collette Stenger get your name? 
I don't know. 
My father is the Secretary of Defense. 
I'm an easy target. 
Maybe she's trying to use him or embarrass him. 
Is he involved? 
Oh, Jack, you know him better than that. 
You worked with him. 
He would never do anything outside the law, and neither would I. 
The two men that we know are part of the conspiracy are Walt Cummings and Christopher Henderson. 
Have you had any contact with these men? 
Christopher Henderson. 
I have never heard... 
I'd never heard of him before today and, um... 
Walt Cummings I-I have met a couple of times, yes. 
Where? 
Um, DoD briefings. 
That's it? 
Yes. 
Are you sure? 
Yes, I'm sure. 
Open it. 
The River Hotel, Pikesville, last April. 
Yeah, I'm sorry. 
Um... We happened 
to be there at the same time. 
We may have had a drink or two together. 
You weren't having drinks with him. 
You shared a room with him. 
You slept with him. 
Yes. 
I was still recovering from losing you, Jack. 
He, uh... 
He had just separated from his wife, and I slept with him once and then I broke it off. 
Why'd you break it off? 
Jack, please, it's complicated. 
Why did you break it off?! 
Because he wasn't you. 
Why did you lie to me when I asked you the first time? 
'Cause I, I was... 
I was afraid that you'd think less of me, that you wouldn't be able to forgive me. 
Because you slept with someone after you thought I was dead? 
Because I slept with someone who turned out to be a traitor, Jack. 
Is that the only time you spent with Cummings? 
Yes. 
Did he ever talk to you about a terrorist attack, nerve gas? 
No. 
He ever mention Christopher Henderson? 
No. 
Damn it, Audrey! 
Jack, I... Jack! 
Tell me the truth! 
I am telling you the t... 
You've already lied to me once. 
You tell me what you know, or I promise you this will become very unpleasant. 
I'm telling you everything. 
All right. 
Do what you have to do. 
Damn it, Audrey. 
Tell me the truth! 
Jack. I am telling you 
the truth, I swear. 
This is over! 
You understand? This is over! 
If you ask me, she broke him and not the other way around. 
Karen. 
He didn't push her hard enough, and you know it. 
He's protecting her. 
She's innocent. 
We have to be certain. 
I am certain. 
Jack is certain. 
Well, I'm not. 
Karen. 
Send Burke in. 
I have to do this, Bill. 
I can't waste any more time, and make sure that Jack doesn't interfere. 
Okay, I'll pass that on. 
Shari. That was 
the agent at Bierko's safe house. 
The place is empty. 
Forensics is still looking, but they don't expect to find much. 
Upload that information onto the subnets. 
Oh. Right. 
I checked your file. 
You're not qualified for Level Three work, and that is not a Three. 
I'm provisionally qualified. 
It's all in my supplemental file. Go ahead 
and check it if you want. 
All right, Shari. 
First mistake, I yank the provisional and you're out of here. 
What's with him? 
Two years ago we both worked in the San Francisco office. 
There was a sexual harassment thing. 
Miles? 
It was subtle at first, and then it got really bad. 
Finally filed a grievance. 
What happened? 
He got off with a warning. 
These things are really hard to prove. 
They said we didn't have enough evidence to go to trial. 
I can't get into any details. 
The file is sealed. 
Don't worry. 
I don't need details. 
But I guess I'd better not make any mistakes. 
Yeah. 
What's going on? 
I'm sorry. This is 
out of my control. 
Karen wants to push Audrey a little harder. 
No, her interrogation is over. 
Jack, I'll try to stall her as long as I can. 
Jack, I have orders to take Miss Raines to Holding for further interrogation. 
I don't care about your orders. 
That's not gonna happen. 
Get out of my way. 
Get out of my way. 
Jack, stop it! 
Jack, don't make this any harder than it is. 
( taser buzzing ) AUDREY: Stop it, Jack! Stop it! Jack! 
Bill, do something! 
Bill! 
Bill! 
Hello. 
Mr. Henderson, it's Brennan. 
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet? 
No. 
Explain. 
We rolled his car, but he survived and got away. 
It was sloppy work. 
We'll make it right. 
Well, you damn well better. 
You know what's at stake. 
Yes, sir. 
PALMER: This is Wayne Palmer. 
At the tone, leave a message. 
Steve, has Wayne Palmer come through a checkpoint within the last half hour? 
Yeah, he was cleared through Checkpoint 6 30 minutes ago. 
What, he's not here yet? 
No, he's not, and I can't reach him on his cell. 
If you're worried, I can send out an alert. 
No. 
Actually, he kind of wanted to keep his visit under the radar. 
I think I'm going to go out there and take a look myself, in case he had car trouble or something. 
Do me a favor. 
Keep this between us, would you? 
Yes, sir. 
Thanks. 
Thanks. 
KAREN: You need to calm down, Jack, and remember who's in charge. 
Audrey Raines is innocent. 
She slept with a known conspirator and lied about it. 
That doesn't concern you? 
She slept with him once and lied about it because she was embarrassed. 
That hardly makes her part of this conspiracy. 
Why did Collette Stenger name her as the source? 
She must have gotten Audrey's name from Henderson. 
Why would Henderson want to implicate Audrey? 
Henderson doesn't want to implicate Audrey. 
He's coming after me. 
He's trying to make me lose focus. 
And he's trying to pull you off target. 
And he's done it. 
These plans must have been made some time ago, when Henderson had every reason to believe you were gonna be killed. 
Karen, listen to me. 
This is what I do for a living. 
And the first rule of engagement is that you have a contingency plan. 
And this is his, and it's working. 
You're getting ready to interrogate Audrey Raines when you should be interrogating Collette Stenger, because she still has information that we don't have! 
Stenger has immunity. 
She's being protected by a federal marshal. 
That's your doing, Jack. 
You made that deal! 
I know. 
But if I can prove that Collette Stenger is withholding information from us, that act alone negates her deal. 
I'll be able to start questioning her again. 
She will give me Henderson. 
And once I have Henderson, he will lead us to the nerve gas, and that's what we're supposed to be focused on! 
What are you suggesting we do, Jack? 
Let me and Chloe find proof that Collette Stenger is lying to us. 
If we don't, you lose nothing. 
But if we do, we can stop this thing from happening, I promise you. 
Karen, please. 
Excuse me. 
These matrix sweeps are partials only. 
Where's the rest of the data? 
I thought matrix data could be sent unfiltered. 
That's not protocol. 
I thought it was all right in house. 
Only if it's authorized. 
Who authorized it? 
I did. 
She did it under my authority. 
I take full responsibility. 
I don't believe you. 
Believe what you want. 
That would be sloppy, O'Brian. 
You don't work like that. 
She told you about my alleged sexual harassment, right? 
Well, she's lying. 
Listen... 
No, you listen. 
There are 17 canisters of nerve gas about to be deployed somewhere in Los Angeles, and we're trying to find them. 
If you interrupt our work one more time, I'll file a complaint with Division. 
Then you'll see what protocol's all about. 
Thank you. 
Chloe, we need to help Audrey. 
We don't have much time. 
How? 
We need to find the connection between Collette Stenger and Henderson. 
We found Collette's name on Henderson's computer. 
It's not enough. 
We need proof that they had direct contact, preferably more than once. 
You think Henderson gave Collette Audrey's name? 
I'm sure of it. I want you 
to use outside agencies, including foreign. 
Put it on a priority channel. 
I'm on it. 
We have an important delivery. 
There's no delivery scheduled. 
I'm gonna need to call this in. 
( gunshots ) Stay out here and watch the perimeter. 
( indistinct conversation ) Who's in charge? 
I am. 
We need access to the control room. 
Can you take us there? 
What are you guys doing here? 
Can you take us to the control room? 
Yeah. It's that way. 
Good. 
Keep cooperating and no more of your friends will die. 
Do you understand? 
Yes. 
Mikhail, take the canisters to the main distribution tank. 
Quickly! 
( steam hissing ) This is it. 
Don't move. 
Hands away from the console. 
Sam, what's going on? 
Ah, Sam... I'm not an engineer, 
but I know enough, so you'd be wise not to try to deceive me. 
What we're doing here is very simple. 
We're going to release a certain substance so that it flows into your pipelines. 
What kind of substance? 
That's not your concern. 
But at the pressure which currently prevails in these pipes, the substance will react chemically with the gas and become inert. 
So I need the pressure reduced by about 50%. 
Sam, don't do it. 
Do you understand what I want? 
You want PSI cut by half. 
Exactly. 
And how long will it take? 
Could take an hour. 
You don't seem to care very much for your friends, do you, Sam? 
No, no, don't! 
I might be able to do it in 30 minutes. 
You have 15. 
Better get started. 
PALMER: Don't move! 
Drop the gun. 
Now! 
Move away from it. 
Now get on your knees. 
Mr. Palmer. 
It's Aaron. 
Oh, God. 
Aaron, what are you doing out here? 
I was looking for you, sir. 
So are some other people. 
Let's go. 
( gasps ) BURKE: Ms. Raines, we know you 
conspired with Mr. Cummings. 
I didn't. 
Who else in the White House was involved? 
I don't know. 
You know, Ms. Raines. 
I don't have... have any names. 
You're gonna give me a name... 
I swear I don't know, I... 
We don't have the time, Ms. Raines. 
Give me a name! 
I don't... I swear. 
I don't know. 
Chloe, what have you got? 
I found some masked entries in Collette Stenger's cell phone. 
The decryption program... 
Come on, Chloe. 
Bottom line: Henderson placed eight cell phone calls to Collette Stenger within the past three months. 
Where's Collette Stenger now? 
Holding Room 3. 
Bill, we have a connection between Henderson and Collette Stinger. 
She received eight calls from him that she didn't tell us about. 
That voids her agreement. 
It's off. 
That's for the president to decide. 
Call the president! 
You need a rescinding order to question her, Jack. 
Get him to back off of Audrey! 
Get me the president. 
What's your connection with Christopher Henderson? 
I have an immunity agreement signed by your president. 
She's right. 
She can't be questioned. 
We have proof that she withheld information. 
Her deal's been rescinded. 
The order's on its way. 
When it gets here, she's all yours. 
An innocent woman is being interrogated because of her. 
Look, I'm sorry, sir, but  you have to go. 
We know you lied to us. 
We know that you did not get the schematics from Audrey Raines. 
Henderson told you to use her name in case you got in trouble, right? 
You do not want to try me. 
Yes. 
He tell you why? 
No. 
He's using you. 
He wanted you to get inside my head. 
It worked. 
Now I'm... upset. 
You have three seconds to tell me where the target is, or I will kill you. 
Where's the target?! 
A natural gas distribution center. 
There are dozens of those in the city. Which one? 
I don't know. 
I swear. 
( hammer cocking ) I don't know. 
I don't. 
Jack, what's going on? 
Bierko's targeting a natural gas distribution center, but we don't know which one. 
Natural gas? 
He can use it as a delivery system for the Sentox. 
He can get it into people's homes. 
I need you to get Chloe on it. 
We need to find out which one. 
Right. The rescinding 
order will be here in 15 minutes. 
Good. Give it to the marshal. 
He'll be looking for this, too. 
Please, no more. 
I'm begging you. 
Please. Don't do 
that. Please... 
( sobbing ) Please. I'm telling 
you the truth. 
You're bringing this on yourself. 
( screams )No! 
Stop it! Make him... 
This can end whenever you want it to... 
Let her go! 
Shut it down now! 
Jack! 
You are finished in here. 
She is innocent. 
You can confirm it with Buchanan. 
I said you're finished. 
Get out! 
Audrey, are you all right? 
I don't know. 
It's over. 
I promise you, it's over for good. 
My God, what's happening to me? 
What's happening? 
( moans ) Henderson set you up... 
to get at me, to throw me off his trail. 
Come here. 
I'm so sorry. 
Jack, the only thing that got me through this... 
was knowing that you would come. 
I knew you would come. 
I'm so sorry. 
( sniffles ) ( cell phone rings ) Bauer. 
Jack, it's Bill. We need you. 
Go. 
Jack? 
I'll be right there. 
Yep. 
Bill, I want you to send someone over from medical to Interrogation 1 to tend to Audrey Raines. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
Gonna be all right? 
Go. It's okay. 
Our satellite covers only 60% of the distribution centers. 
If our target's not in that grouping, we're out of luck. 
Can we redirect any other satellite? 
I'm trying. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, the medic's on the way. 
JACK: Did you identify the distribution center that they're gonna hit? 
We're pulling in more satellites. 
Our analysts tell us once the Sentox hits the main tank, it goes right into the pipes, where it becomes impossible to stop. 
From there, it goes straight into people's homes. 
How many casualties are we talking about? 
The largest centers serve 90,000 people. 
We could have twice that many casualties. 
If our intel is correct, we have 15 minutes. 
Okay, I'll prep a team with Curtis. We'll go airborne. 
We'll be ready as soon as you ID a target. 
Mr. Buchanan? 
There may be a faster way. 
I was a chem major at Cal Tech. 
Most toxins become inert under high pressure. 
The PSI would have to be lowered before the nerve gas was introduced. 
Chloe, can you monitor the pressure levels at the distribution centers? 
Yeah. I have citywide 
readings of them all. 
Hold on. 
Wilshire Gas Company. 
The PSI has dropped to 75% in the past ten minutes. 
We have to assume that's it. 
I'll tell Jack. 
Great work, Sherry. 
Congratulations. 
Thanks. 
Did you see the way his hand brushed across my shoulder as he walked by? 
What? 
That was wrong. 
He shouldn't have done that. 
( rustling ) What is it? 
Get down! 
Get in the car! 
JACK: Chloe, what's the PSI level? 
PSI level is down to 57%. 
Another seven is all they need to deploy the Sentox. 
How long will that take? 
Four, maybe five minutes. 
Jack, the PSI level can only be adjusted from the main control room. 
It's the large building in the center of the complex two floors down from the roof. 
Copy that. 
Okay, we'll insert here. 
We'll advance to the control room, locate and secure the canisters. 
We're almost there. 
The noise from the plant should cover our descent. 
We're ready. 
Good. 
Get back here. 
How much longer? 
A few more minutes. 
I can't lower the pressure any faster without risking a shutdown. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Do you have any heat signatures? 
Yes, but I can only scan from the exterior of the site. 
There are two guards patrolling the perimeter. 
I've given the pilot an approach vector to keep you from their line of sight. 
Maintain this position! 
Go! 
CTU, the team's away. 
They're on the roof. 
The PSI level is down to 54%. 
CTU, we're inside. 
Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute. 
Copy that. 
( silenced gunshots ) Silencers off. 
Door. 
Bierko! 
( gunshots continue ) ( beep ) Keep moving! Cover me! 
Curtis, the Sentox is already in the system. 
Who's in charge here?! 
Listen to me. 
You have Sentox nerve gas running through your pipeline. 
Can you shut down the pumps? 
By the time we power down, gas will be in the main tanks, then it's out into the city. 
Where's the closest pipeline that feeds those tanks? 
Just out the door to your left. 
It'll have a red arrow on it. 
Give me the C4 and a timer, then get these people out of here. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, what are you doing? 
In order to deliver the Sentox, it had to mix with natural gas. 
If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated. 
Bill, this is the last chance we've got to stop this threat. 
The Sentox has been in the system for one minute. 
You have 50 seconds before it gets out. 
Charge has been set. 
Curtis, are you clear? 
Just about. 
Keep going. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, are you clear? 
Jack? 
Jack, respond. 
Come on, Jack. 
( loud explosions ) Jack, you okay? 
Curtis, I got a visual on Bierko. 
Jack, you won't have time before the main tank explodes. 
Right now he's our only connection to Henderson. 
Jack! 
Bill, he's going in. 
JACK: Bierko! 
( rumbling explosion ) ( loud thud ) Jack, that's it. 
The main tanks are going. 
Get out! 
The terrorists are controlling the main terminal at Ontario Airport. 
Today, your president and the president of Russia have come together to sign an anti-terrorism alliance. 
I have hostages. 
( on TV ): Unless President Logan and President Suvarov make a joint statement repudiating this accord, I will order their execution. 
I want this handled! 
Do you understand? 
I don't care how you do it. 
I don't care what it takes. 
Fix it! 
David Palmer called me last night. 
He said it was a matter of national security. 
Those were his exact words. 
PALMER: I need to talk to you. 
It's hardly a matter of national security. 
That's not what he said. 
Yes, it is. 
No, that is a trick. 
MARTHA: I know that all phone conversations are recorded. 
Where do they store those transcripts? 
Archive room, down the hall. 
This is Bill Buchanan. 
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully. 
I don't think you understand just how serious we are. 
You make any efforts to enter the tunnel, you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts. 
Jack, I'm going to need you to quarterback this thing from inside. 
I'm staring straight down on the main concourse. 
We've got six hostiles wearing explosive vests. 
We have to assume their orders are to detonate if we try to make a move. 
Hey, I got a woman Diane Huxley says she has info for CTU. 
Diane, what's going on? 
What's wrong? 
Derek is inside the terminal. 
You! 
No... 
JACK: Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages. 
Oh, my God, it's Derek. 
You have a problem at the terminal. 
Jack Bauer is inside providing recon for CTU's rescue operation. 
( loud static ) Mr. Bauer, 
Derek has five seconds left to live. 
Four, three... 
Beresch! 
We've been trying from here, but we still can't make contact with Jack. 
Can you make a visual, Curtis? 
Negative. 
Maybe Jack went dark intentionally. 
Unlikely. He was 
talking to us when his transmission cut off. 
We have to assume he's been captured or killed. 
Which means we need to mount this assault without his help. 
Without Jack directing our teams, success probability falls to less than 20%. 
President Logan is going to sign this treaty in less than an hour. 
If the terrorists are still in control, they'll kill all the hostages. 
What do you want me to do, Bill? 
Work up an assault plan that doesn't include Jack. 
All right, I'm going back to the staging area. 
We'll coordinate from there. 
Back to your stations. 
Prepare to reconfigure. 
All teams, stand down. 
We're working up a new mission profile. 
Mr. Bauer, 
what is CTU's assault plan? 
The boy means something to you otherwise, you wouldn't have given yourself up so easily. 
Tell me the plan. 
They're going to storm the north concourse doors on my command. 
I'm coordinating the operation from in here. 
Is there anyone else inside? 
No. 
Get me the plans to the terminal. 
You've been a great help. 
We'll keep the boy. 
Bring me another hostage. 
Anything you do in here today will not stop that treaty from being signed. 
The United States Government does not negotiate with terrorists-- you know that. 
Your president is a weak man. 
He'll back down once more blood is spilled. 
Not him. 
Move! Move! 
I'm not your enemy... 
Please... Please, 
you don't have to do this. 
Vlad. 
I can help you buy more time-- please! 
No! You don't have 
to do this now. 
CTU was supposed to have raided the terminal by now. 
Why haven't we heard from them? 
Bill Buchanan said they had a setback. 
What kind of setback? 
They lost contact with Jack Bauer. 
( phone ringing ) Why? What happened to him? 
They're not sure what happened to him, but they need to reconfigure their assault plan. Yeah. 
I'll tell the President. 
Beresch is transmitting from the terminal. 
He's got another hostage. 
BERESCH: We have waited patiently for you to renounce this unholy pact with our oppressors, but we have heard nothing. 
This is the cost of that silence. 
( gunshot ) ( hostages screaming ) BERESCH: What happens next is your choice, Mr. President. 
If you choose to sign this corrupt document, understand that you will also be staining it with the blood of the remaining hostages. 
If CTU can't pull this off in time, that's upwards of 60 people, Mike. 
You know I've never done anything in my presidency that I didn't feel was right for the country. 
Of course not, sir. 
Nobody thinks otherwise. 
I know I'm ambitious, that I want this treaty to be the hallmark of my presidency, but I never thought I would sacrifice innocent life. 
Mr. President, 
you are not responsible for the actions of these murderers. 
I could postpone this. 
Sir?! 
I give them what they want, maybe nobody else has to die. 
Do you think these people would actually release the hostages? 
We both know that would never happen. 
You're doing the only thing you can do. 
TV REPORTER: The terrorists, calling the treaty an "unholy pact..." 
Mrs. Logan, if someone 
altered the recording, of your conversation with David Palmer, the President needs to know. 
No. Not now. Not yet. 
What are you waiting for? 
Charles is much too preoccupied. 
Between the summit and the hostage situation, he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this. 
Besides, he thinks I'm unstable. 
Which means I have to show it to him in just the right way. 
So, until the treaty is signed, I'm not letting this out of my sight. 
( indistinct radio transmissions ) What's happening? 
I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain. 
You said you were going in to get the hostages. 
We lost contact with Jack. 
What does that mean? 
We're not sure what happened. 
But we need to change our assault plan. 
Is Jack okay? 
We don't know. 
What about Derek? 
As soon as we get more information, I'll make sure you're told. 
Please, I... 
Ms. Huxley... 
I need to go. 
REPORTER: The situation here continues to grow more tragic. 
We've just received a video feed confirming that another hostage has been executed inside the main terminal at Ontario Airport. 
Jack... 
Don't say anything. 
We're going to get through this. 
Just don't say anything right now. 
TV REPORTER: ...White House spokesperson 
confirms and reiterates the President's intention to sign the historic pact with his Russian counterpart as scheduled. 
You're going to call CTU and tell them you've revised your assault profile. 
Tell them to come to the emergency door south of gate 12. 
They won't just do that because I ask them to. 
They'll need an explanation. 
That's your concern, Mr. Bauer. 
Overwrite volume four with the approach vectors, and re-key with the airport grid. 
Okay, hold on, just for one second. 
We don't have one second. 
We're running out of time to save the hostages. 
Want some help, Spenser? 
He doesn't need any help. 
Just keep managing the two-ways or else we're gonna have dropout. 
Excuse me. 
You're Ms. O'Brian, right? 
Who are you? 
Lynn McGill. 
I'm from District. 
I met you when you came out for that memory management lecture. 
If you say so. 
What do you need? 
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan. 
Is he around? 
He's in the Situation Room. 
He's kind of busy right now. 
I see him. Thanks. 
I look forward to working with you today. 
You don't know who Lynn McGill is, do you? 
No, and I don't care. 
Get back to work. 
BUCHANAN: Once Curtis and his teams go in there, I want an update on deployment of HRT. 
Hi. 
Mr. Buchanan, I assume 
they told you I was coming. 
Lynn, please... call me Bill. 
If we were having a beer or something, but at work, it's better if we maintain a more formal mode of address. 
Whatever makes you feel comfortable. 
Look, we're in the middle of final prep here... 
I know; I understand President Logan wants us to go into the terminal as soon as possible. 
Yes, before the treaty is signed. 
Is Curtis Manning ready to send his teams in? 
He is, but we're flying blind. 
My briefing sheet says that we have Jack Bauer on the inside. 
And we haven't heard from him for close to 20 minutes now. 
Well, that's interesting. 
Lynn, I read the bulletin from Division, but I still don't know why you're here. 
District was getting heat from the White House. 
Heat about what? 
Jack Bauer. 
They just want to know things are running smoothly. 
We're on track, Lynn. 
Well, I'm sure you are... 
but that's my assignment. 
Is your tactical wired through to all the servers? 
Yes, it is-- you can go ahead and plug into Station Four. 
I'd prefer to work from your office, Mr. Buchanan. 
I hate to displace you, but I think I should have a central vantage point, and I just want to make sure that you're okay working from another station. 
Fine. 
Good. 
And, uh, it's not a big deal, but just so that everyone's clear on the chain of command, I think you should address me as Mr. McGill 
in front of the others. 
You know, Lynn, I'd rather not. 
Just a suggestion. 
Anyway, I need your office. 
And that's not a suggestion. 
( intercom beeps ) Fine. 
( over intercom ): Mr. Buchanan, it's Jack Bauer 
on line one. 
Is Curtis plugged into this call? 
CURTIS: I'm on, Bill. 
Go ahead, put Jack through. 
( over intercom ): You're both on with Jack Bauer. 
Jack, what happened? 
One of the hostiles got too close, I had to end the transmission. 
CURTIS: All right, we'll restart the countdown. 
Negative, Curtis. 
We need to scrap the existing plan, find a new breach point. 
My men are already in position. 
They moved the hostages within the kill zone. 
They'll be taken out with the crossfire. 
There's an emergency door just south of gate 12. 
It's unguarded. 
You should be able to punch through with no opposition. 
I see it, but I'm not comfortable with this entry point. 
It's the only shot we've got. 
Are you there now? 
Yes. It's clear. 
I'm in a flank two position. 
I repeat, I am in flank two position. 
Curtis, how long before your teams can redeploy? 
About 20 minutes. 
The President's going to sign that treaty within 30 minutes. 
I'll go as fast as I can. 
Jack, I'll call you when my men are in position. 
You can call us in. 
Copy that. 
I'll be standing by. 
Ivan and Ishmael, stay with the hostages. 
The rest of you come here. 
Vlad, guard them. 
Manning. 
It's Buchanan. 
How long until your people are ready to move on the terrorists? 
About 15 minutes. 
Why so long? 
When Jack called and changed the breach point, I had to modify everything, including the explosives. 
They have to be repositioned precisely. 
Maybe it's a mistake to write down Jack's new information. 
It might take too long. 
Jack's aware of our deadline. 
If he didn't think it was worth the delay, he wouldn't have made the call. 
I trust him. 
All right, Curtis, 15 minutes. 
You have to make this happen. 
I will. 
Call when you're in position. 
Mr. Buchanan? Mr. McGill needs 
to see you in his office. 
It'll have to wait. 
Tell him I'm busy. 
He said it had to be now. 
Fine. 
No, I'm settled in fine. 
If I need anything, I'll call. 
Thanks, Donna. 
What is it, Lynn? 
I'm up to my ears trying to coordinate this hostage situation. 
Sit down, Mr. Buchanan. 
Would you stop with the "Mr. Buchanan"? 
We need to get this assault in motion now. 
Sit down, Bill. 
I informed the White House that the rescue operation is back on track. 
Thank you. 
I must admit, though, I felt a little inappropriate talking about an operation that I didn't personally review, so before you send your men into the terminal, I'd like to see the Playbook. 
Look, I can't have you micro-managing my work here, Lynn. 
If you want to do my job, just let me know. 
I'll go home. 
Please don't be defensive. 
I'm not challenging you. 
I'm just trying to do my job. 
( sighs ) I'll have Chloe send it to your laptop. 
Anything else? 
That's all for now. 
Bill? 
Fighting me isn't going to increase our chances of saving those people's lives. 
Lynn wants to look at the revised assault plan. 
Send it to him. 
Does that mean he's running point, instead of you? 
It just means he wants to see the plan, Chloe. 
Bill, Curtis just confirmed that his team will be ready in ten minutes based on Jack's new intel. 
TV REPORTER: As of this time, there is no word as to whether or not the president is going to call off the signing of the historic treaty agreement between the United States and Russia scheduled for just under an hour. 
There been any response from the White House since we killed the last hostage? 
They released their statement confirming the signing of the treaty is going ahead as planned. 
They won't capitulate, as long as they think their rescue attempt will succeed. 
Once we kill them, then they'll realize their options have run out. 
The only chance these people had of being rescued is gone because of me. 
People were going to die here today, Derek. 
That was their plan. 
This is not your fault. 
I'm the reason you went along with them. 
If I wasn't here... 
Stop it. 
( sniffling ) This is not over. 
TV REPORTER: While there has been no official rebuke of the terrorists' demands, statements from the White House appear to confirm the president's position is unchanged, and that the treaty will be signed within the hour, as scheduled. 
That puts the lives of the approximately 60 men, women and children being held as hostage in question. 
Were the terrorists to carry out their intentions... 
Good news, sir. 
CTU has reestablished contact with Jack Bauer. 
The rescue operation is back on track. 
But that's still no guarantee. 
Excuse me, sir? 
The hostages may be killed when we go in there. 
Let's be honest. 
That's more likely than not. 
We don't know that, sir. 
President Suvarov is waiting for you outside. 
You're walking outside together onto the stage. 
We all agreed to the protocol. 
It's time already? 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. President. 
Shall we? 
My people have just informed me that the assault has been delayed. 
It's happening now. 
It will happen before the treaty is signed. 
Don't worry. 
Mr. President, like you, 
I have staked much of my political future on the success of this treaty. 
If this rescue attempt fails it will not only be rendered meaningless, it will become a mockery. 
And so will we. 
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan. 
The ceremony's beginning any minute. 
She'll be out in a moment. 
Oh, may I... 
have a word? 
You're aware Mrs. Logan 
was found in one of the archive rooms? 
Uh... I don't know 
anything about that. 
Aaron Pierce said you lied to him. 
You told him Mrs. Logan 
was in her room, when she was actually going through classified documents. 
I don't think you understand just how grave this situation is. 
What do you mean? 
Mrs. Logan removed a document 
from the archive that contains highly-sensitive intelligence protocols. 
That's not what she said it was. 
What exactly did she say she took? 
I think that you should talk to her about this. 
Evelyn, this is important. 
What did she tell you? 
She said it was a transcript of a call she had with David Palmer. 
And I'm sure when she said that, she believed it. 
You're aware if this document finds its way into the wrong hands, that you'll be held responsible. 
I'm not the one who took it. 
No, you aided and abetted. 
You'll not only lose your job, you'll be prosecuted. 
That's not fair. 
Hmm... 
I tried to talk her out of this. 
Look, all I'm asking is that you tell me where did she put it. 
She has it with her. 
It's in her blouse. 
She said she wouldn't let it out of her sight until she talked to the president about it. 
( door opens ) Walt? 
Sorry to keep you waiting. 
I'm ready now. 
( door shuts ) Presidents Logan and Suvarov will each make statements, which will be followed by the signing of the treaty. 
There will be several photo opportunities... 
How much time will there be between the moment I step out on stage and when I sign the document? 
Not long. 
Does CTU know that's how long they have to launch the rescue attempt? 
Yes, sir. They're 
with what's going on here. 
( sighs ) I hope so. 
The lives of those hostages depend on it. 
( spokesman speaking indistinctly ) Today was supposed to be the crowning achievement of my presidency. 
Instead, everybody's waiting to hear what's going to happen at the airport. 
( chuckles, sighs ) So, how are you feeling? 
I'm fine. 
Don't worry about me. 
How come you just keep getting better looking as you get older, and I just keep getting older? 
What are you talking about? 
You're the most beautiful first lady Pennsylvania Avenue has ever seen. 
( spokesman speaking indistinctly ) Ladies and gentlemen, President Logan and President Suvarov. 
The treaty signing is a minute and a half ahead of schedule. 
Should you call Curtis and let him know? 
He might need to speed up the assault prep. 
No. Curtis is moving 
as fast as he can. 
A call from me isn't gonna make him move any faster. 
I just thought he might like to... 
I said no, Chloe. 
The only way to make sure the assault happens in time to save the hostages is to try to slow down the signing. 
What's wrong with Buchanan? 
Nothing. 
I think he just realizes we're not gonna be able to save the hostages. 
Before we begin the treaty signing, I would like to address what's happening just a few miles away from here. 
As you know, terrorists have already taken innocent life in an attempt to stop this historic treaty from being signed. 
President Suvarov will not let this happen. 
I will not let this happen! 
BUCHANAN: Yes, Mike? 
Bill, I should have heard from you by now. 
Have your men gone in yet? 
We're not quite ready. 
You have to go in now. 
The president's about to sign that treaty. 
I understand. 
We're pushing as hard as we can. 
In the meantime, is there anything you can do on your end? 
Like what? 
Can you stall things? 
Can you slow down the ceremony? 
Bill, the entire world is watching this on live television. 
The presidents of the United States and Russia are on stage now. 
This process has been set in motion. 
No, I can't stall. 
Okay, I'll call you back. 
No. You stay on the phone 
with me. 
I need to know the moment your people go in. 
Yes, sir. 
( people clapping ) This barbaric lawlessness that's taking place at Ontario Airport only underscores the need... 
the necessity for this accord and for our continued vigilance and commitment to fighting terrorism around the world. 
It looks like President Logan is going through with the signing. 
He said he's not going to give in to your demands. 
Are you sure this is going to work? 
It will work. 
And the reason the president is so confident is that he thinks his rescue attempt will save the day. 
Are you sure you can fend off that assault? 
As soon as the CTU agents come through the entry point that Jack Bauer fed to them they'll all be killed. 
One of the president's aides will then walk up to the podium and whisper into his ear that there'll be no rescue, that his signature on the treaty will be the death warrant of the hostages. 
That will stop him, I assure you. 
Well, just in case you're wrong and he signs the treaty, you be ready to carry out your threat. 
Every one of my men is committed to doing what needs to be done today. 
We've upgraded our estimate of how many wounded there'll be. 
I need ten more ambulances at the airport before we launch. 
Right. 
The rescue operation you're about to execute is radically changed from your initial approach. 
It was revised based on new intelligence from Jack Bauer. 
Which he phoned in after going dark for nearly 20 minutes; I was there. 
Right. 
I need to call you back. 
Well, I can't say that his explanation for being out of touch is entirely satisfactory. 
Jack said he was trying to avoid detection. 
Wh-What are you suggesting? 
There's too many unusual circumstances at work here I want to try to understand it better before we send our people in. 
I'll need the entire transcripts of your communications with Mr. Bauer 
since he's been inside. 
To what end? 
Thoroughness. 
I don't need a sorting run on the calls, just the raw transcripts'll be fine. 
Fine, I'll send them to you. 
Thank you. 
Curtis is on line three. 
Curtis, what's your situation? 
My men are in place, and we're setting the entry charges. 
Any complications? 
No. 
We're also jamming the trigger frequency so Beresch can't detonate the vests remotely. 
We should be able to make our entry on target. 
Good. 
( ringing ) O'Brian. 
Uh, Miss O'Brian, I'm trying to understand the transcript of Jack's last call to CTU, and there are... 
Mr. McGill, I'm really 
busy trying to help keep this revised assault on schedule what do you need? 
I understand, and I don't want to slow you down, but I'd appreciate it if you'd unlock volume five-- there are a few things that I'd like to see. 
I don't need to know what you'd like to see. 
Okay, it's unlocked. 
Good. 
This Lynn McGill person's really slowing things down. 
Yeah, that's his style. 
I worked with him once before. 
He usually loses about... 
20% of his staff in the first couple of days after taking control of a new office. 
That many people quit? 
No. 
Most of them are fired. 
In the volatile climate of the 21st century, the sharing of deterrent technologies by responsible powers is the surest guarantee of global peace. 
But let this accord be proof that our two great nations stand together in their commitment to fight the enemies of peace and freedom. 
( panting ): Akhmed found Chevensky. 
He's dead. 
He killed himself we found him in the baggage room. 
What about the key card? 
Chevensky had it hidden right where he said he would. 
BERESCH: The rest of you will work cleanup on whoever makes it through that line of fire. 
Assume CTU is in body armor, so go for the head shot. 
You... and you, 
guard the hostages. 
Kill anyone who tries to break away. 
the black night is broken by the dawning of the light of global peace. 
( phone ringing ) ( ringing continues ) Curtis. 
Jack, my men are in place. 
Okay. 
Now, remember, I am in a flank two position make sure your men don't hit me when they come in. 
Roger that. Ready to start 
the countdown on your word. 
Jack? 
( panting ) Move in at your discretion. 
All teams, we have a green light. 
Counting down from 60 seconds on my mark. 
Now. 
Jack, we'll see you inside. 
Everyone, 60 seconds. 
( rhythmic beeping ) ( beeping continues ) Stop the assault! 
Put Curtis on the phone. 
What are you talking about? 
They're walking into a trap. 
Look at the transcript. 
When Jack issued the command directive, he used the term "Flank two." 
Yes, he was trying to give us his position. 
inside the terminal. 
No, he wasn't. 
"Flank two" is a duress code used to indicate the agent is communicating under duress. 
We ran Jack's calls through a protocol filter if there'd been a duress signal in there, it would've found it. 
You filtered through the current codes. 
When Jack was active, "Flank two" was a duress code. 
Chloe, confirm that. 
Jack is trying to tell us he's being used to send misinformation. 
If Curtis Manning's teams go in now, they'll be ambushed. 
He's right. 
Curtis, abort the countdown. 
Repeat, abort, abort. 
Stand down. 
All teams stand down. 
We're aborting entry. 
Repeat, we're aborting entry. 
Confirm that we're standing down. 
What's wrong? 
We detected a duress code in Jack's call. 
We have to assume that terrorists are feeding him the information he gave us. 
Redeploy your men according to the original assault plan and do not contact Jack. 
If Jack contacts you, buy time. 
Copy that. We're moving. 
You're gonna outflank the terrorists? 
Yes. 
That should work. 
CURTIS: All teams, reposition for entry through the east and north gates-- plan Bravo, repeat, plan Bravo through the east and north gates. Go! 
Acknowledged. 
Redeploy protocol one. 
What's happening? 
Ma'am, I need you to step back to the vehicle. 
He said 60 seconds three minutes ago. 
What is CTU waiting for?! 
I don't know. 
You heard what I heard. 
( rings ) It's Jack. 
Jack. 
What's happening? 
There was a malfunction on the entry charges. 
What's the time frame? 
Any minute. 
They're resetting the detonators. 
Stand by. 
Copy that. 
They're in position. 
Stay ready! 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
Is it done? 
No. CTU hasn't attacked yet. 
You said it would happen before the signing. 
And you told me the president would never let it go this far. 
He's signing it. 
You have no choice. 
Kill them all. 
No! 
( explosion ) You okay? 
Yeah. 
CURTIS: Secure the terminal. 
Besides the hostiles, there appears to be no further casualties. 
Repeat: remaining hostages are unharmed. 
Good work, Curtis. 
You get that, Mike? 
Yeah... 
( inaudible whispering ) Mr. President, 
I have some good news. 
I have just received word that the crisis at the Ontario Airport is over. 
The rescue operation that I authorized was successful. 
The terrorists have been captured or killed. 
And, best of all, this has all been accomplished with no further loss of innocent life. 
( applauding ) Excuse me, agent! 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I know who you are, sir. 
Can I use your pick? 
This is Derek Huxley. 
His mother is waiting for him at the command post. 
Can you please take him there? 
Of course. 
What about you? 
Come here. 
I have to finish this. 
Go take care of your mother. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Go. 
I'm missing one. 
Everybody, I need your attention. 
We're looking for a man who was being held here with you. 
He's a white male, mid-30s. 
He was wearing a bright yellow tie. 
Did anyone see him leave? 
Anyone? 
Keep the hostages here until I get back. 
( sniffling ) Mom! 
Derek! 
( crying ) Oh, God... 
They were going to kill me. 
Jack saved my life. 
He saves everyone's life. 
Mrs. Huxley, 
I need you and your son to follow me. 
( sniffles ) Can I see Jack Bauer? 
I'm sorry, I have instructions to transport you to CTU. 
This way, please. 
( applause ) Thank you. 
Charles? 
Oh, watch your step. 
I need to talk to you. 
Sweetheart... 
smile, it's over. 
Charles, I just need a few minutes alone with you. 
Yes... soon. 
No! 
Not soon, right now this is very important. 
Martha, when I am done with this, I'll call for you. 
I promise. 
All right, this ends now. 
I have played my role without interfering. 
Now it is time for you to attend to me. 
And I will. 
Charles, do not patronize me! 
Something is going on. 
I am not crying wolf again. 
Martha... 
please... do not ruin 
this moment for me. 
We'll talk later. 
Martha. 
Everything all right? 
No, it's not all right. 
I have to talk to my husband. 
The situation is more dangerous than he realizes. 
Whoa, and what situation is that? 
I'm sorry, Walt. 
I can only talk to Charles about this. 
Curtis just confirmed the area's been contained and their reporting only minor injuries among the hostages. 
Good, thank you. 
You should probably route all field updates through Mr. McGill, 
for the time being. 
Oh, okay. 
Thanks. 
Bill, if you have a moment. 
Lynn, uh, before you say anything, I owe you an apology. 
For what? 
Well, if you hadn't recognized the duress code that Jack transmitted, well... 
Bill, you're the reason I figured out what he was doing. 
What do you mean? 
Well, I admit, I was suspicious of Mr. Bauer, 
but you were so adamant about his integrity that I just... 
looked for a way to reconcile the contradiction, so... 
thank you. 
I assume Mr. Bauer's 
been taken into custody? 
Well, I plan to debrief him here, but not as a suspect. 
Well, he hasn't been officially cleared in the deaths of David Palmer or Michelle Dessler. 
Well, based on mitigating evidence in Chloe O'Brian's testimony, we're confident that Jack was framed for those murders. 
I appreciate that, but it still doesn't change a very tangled situation. 
I mean, we have surveillance footage that places Jack Bauer at the site of David Palmer's assassination. 
Well, clearly, it was doctored. 
Not according to preliminary tests. 
If we're gonna get to the bottom of this, Jack Bauer has a lot to answer for. 
Bring him in now. 
The rest of the terminal's clear. 
MANNING: Jack. 
It's good to see you again. 
It's good to see you. 
We've got a problem one of the hostages is missing. 
He was working with the terrorists. 
Give me a description; I'll take care of it. 
I'll help you now let's go. 
Jack, you need to go back to CTU. 
Buchanan just gave orders to take you into custody. 
I watched Beresch give this guy a key card. 
Something else is going down here. 
We've got to find this guy now. 
And I'll get right on it, but I need you to go with these men, please. 
He's a white male, mid-30s, wearing a dark suit and a yellow tie. 
He's about five-eight. 
We'll find him. 
Okay. Thanks. 
These are my weapons. 
MANNING: Altieri, Hutchinson, we have a possible sleeper among the hostages. 
We're looking for a Caucasian male, five-eight, dark suit, yellow tie. 
Where have you been? 
We had a problem with Chevensky. 
Where is he? 
Dead. 
You have the key? 
* * ( device beeping ) Masks. 
All right, now. 
One, two, three. 
Push it, push it. 
( speaking foreign language ) Do you have the merchandise? 
YELLOW TIE (over phone): Yes, we're moving the canisters out now. 
Good. 
Transportation's been arranged. 
Call me when you're out. 
I will. 
TV REPORTER: This will be remembered as a significant day for President Logan, perhaps a turning point in what has been up until now a fairly unremarkable presidency. 
It is almost symbolic that it should come on the heels of the tragic assassination of David Palmer. 
( door opens ) Evelyn, did you get a chance to speak to my husband? 
As soon as I get the recording, we're going to have to involve your father. 
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark. 
Tell me what this is all about. 
I will. I just 
need a minute. 
I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Anderson. 
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 
President Logan? 
And a man named Christopher Henderson. 
I know what you did. 
I know what you're doing. 
And I'm going to put an end to it. 
You asked to see me, Mr. President? 
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his resignation and I wanted you here as a witness. 
What?! 
He came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks. 
Miles set me up. 
Please come with us, Ms. O'Brian. 
We traced your call to a public phone at Van Nuys Airport. 
If Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble. 
You're supposed to be in custody. 
You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance. 
You're sick and you need help and if you try to stop me, I will recommend you for psychiatric evaluation. 
I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey. 
I haven't talked to them either. 
Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us. 
I promise you. 
Not here. 
Outside the south stable. 
Is Bauer dead? 
Not yet, Mr. President. 
He has the recording. 
Yes, sir. 
That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death. 
Son of a bitch. 
What the hell's going on?! 
They've come for the recording. 
Audrey! 
I have her, Jack! 
JACK: What have you done to her? 
The left brachial artery. 
She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death. 
Now throw me that recording. 
Jack, don't do it. 
She's running out of time. 
AUDREY: Don't give it up. 
Here it is. 
Stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
( panting ) I need to loosen the tourniquet. 
Oh! Ooh! 
Good. The bleeding's stopped, 
which means he didn't sever the brachial artery. 
I need to get you to a doctor. 
Jack, I can wait. 
Do what you have to do. 
Are you sure? 
Yes. 
Keep your arm elevated. 
( panting ) ( touch tone beeping ) FEMALE VOICE: Chloe O'Brian is not available. 
Chloe's not picking up her phone. 
Is there someone else who can help you track Henderson? 
No one who has the same access to the CTU satellite network. 
Jack, I'm so sorry. 
This is my fault. 
Audrey, stop it. 
( phone ringing ) I'll be right back. 
( ringing continues ) This is Jack Bauer. 
Jack? 
Why are you answering Wexler's phone? 
Wexler's dead. 
Henderson and a commando unit attacked us 15 minutes ago. 
They killed all your men and took the recording back. 
Is Audrey all right? 
She's fine. 
Did you cut your deal with Logan? 
Logan accepted my terms. 
Then he took a call, and suddenly changed his mind. 
That call must have come from Henderson. 
Jack, we have to get the recording back. 
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know. 
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, 
I asked you for your help, and you betrayed me. 
Jack, I did what I thought was best for this country. 
I made a mistake. 
Please forgive me. 
I need to go, sir. 
( panting ) ( touch tones beeping ) ( phone ringing ) Hello? 
Bill, it's Jack. 
Jack, we've been waiting to hear from you. 
Did you get the recording to Secretary Heller? 
I don't have time to explain. 
Henderson's got the recording. 
I need Chloe to help me find him, but I can't reach her. 
Chloe's here with me, Jack. 
She was arrested by Homeland Security for helping you, but she managed to get away. 
Put her on speaker. 
Jack, where are you? 
I'm at Van Nuys Airfield. 
Chloe, listen to me. 
Henderson left here ten minutes ago with a recording that implicates President Logan. 
I need you to access CTU's satellite data streams so that we can find him. 
If I log onto their system, they're gonna find me eventually, no matter what I do. 
I don't need you to track him for long. 
Do you think you can do it? 
I guess I can try to slip in through the subnets. 
Get back to me when you're in. 
I'll set up a VPN pathway, so that they can't trace our call, but it will only work with the phone you're using. 
Okay. I got a hold 
of Chloe. We need to go. 
Okay. 
Can you get up? 
Yeah. 
Slowly. 
( groans ) Come on. 
If we're going to do extensive satellite tracking, I need more than my laptop. 
I'm gonna have to network onto your computer, even though it's kind of pathetic, and I need you to get that screen to work for me. 
All right. 
I hope you don't mind me bossing you around, but technically, I don't work for you anymore. 
That's all right, Chloe. 
Good. 
( phone ringing ) ( soft groan ) Oh. 
Bauer. 
Jack, I'm pulling up satellite footage of the airfield from 15 minutes ago. 
Look for an explosion in the northwest corner. 
Okay, I see it. 
About five minutes after that, a vehicle leaves the airfield. 
That'll be Henderson. 
He went south on the service drive, and east on Menders, then I lose him on the grid. 
Use another satellite, traffic cams, whatever you have to, just find him. 
It's gonna take us a few minutes. 
We're just setting up, but we're on it. 
Copy that. 
Get back to me as soon as you got him on a live feed. 
( engine starting ) ( tires squealing ) ( groans ) What makes you think that Henderson hasn't already destroyed the recording? 
He would have done it immediately, in front of me. 
Given me less of a reason to come after him. 
Why would he keep it? 
It's his insurance. 
( phone ringing ) Yes. 
Is Bauer dead? 
No. 
What happened? 
All that matters is that I have the recording. 
Have you destroyed it? 
No, sir, I have not. 
Why, what's the problem? 
Actually, I'm making sure they're won't be any problems. 
I don't understand. 
I may need protection. 
That recording gives it to me. 
Protection? 
Yes, sir. 
Do you mean from me? 
That's absurd. 
With all due respect, Mr. President, 
it isn't absurd, as evidenced by Walt Cummings suicide. 
That was different. 
You told me yourself that was necessary. 
And I'm assuming that one day, others will tell you the very same thing about me. 
Chris, you and I have been in this from the beginning. 
Destroying that recording protects both of us. 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
I give you my word it will be kept in a very place safe, and will only be made public should I meet with some... accident. 
Chris, this is completely unnecessary. 
I'm sure it is, sir. 
Then again, I am a very cautious man. 
( phone ringing ) Chloe, have you got Henderson yet? 
Yes, his car is three quarters of a mile in front of you. 
He had a head start. 
He should be farther along than that. 
I don't know what to tell you. 
It's definitely the car he left the airport in. 
How long until I've got a visual? 
The road curves up ahead, Jack. 
You should be able to see him once it straightens out. 
Hold on. 
( tires squealing ) Got him. 
( engine revving ) ( tires squealing ) ( thudding ) ( door squeaking ) ( tires squealing ) Get down. 
( chamber clicks empty ) Damn! 
It's over, Christopher. 
Turn around! 
Put the gun down and keep your hands where I can them. 
Do it or I will kill you! 
You kill me, Jack, Secretary Heller dies, too. 
What are you talking about? 
There's always a contingency plan, Jack. You know that. 
My men have been tracking Heller from a chopper ever since he left Logan's Retreat. 
Now, if I can't contact them every 15 minutes on the dot, they have orders to kill Secretary Heller. 
Which means, you got about three minutes to save his life. 
Jack? 
Audrey, please get back in the car. 
Is he lying about my father? 
Slowly walk towards me. 
Put your hands behind your head. 
Get on your knees. 
Cuff yourself. 
( touch tones beeping ) Yeah, Jack. 
Chloe, patch me through to Secretary Heller's cell phone. 
See if you can get a satellite to lock on his signal. 
I need you to download a visual of his vehicle on my PDA. 
He was leaving Logan's retreat just before 1:00. 
On it. Open up the parallel 
channel on the NSA's landsats, can radial slices in three mile increments, emanating from the Retreat... sir. 
Okay, Jack, I'm pulling up the DOD database. 
Here it is, I'm patching you through. 
Copy that. 
( phone ringing through ) ( phone ringing ) Heller. 
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack. 
I need you to confirm for me if a helicopter's been tracking your vehicle? 
What's going on, Jack? 
Sir, time is critical. 
Is there a helicopter above you or not? 
Yeah, there's a chopper above me. 
Who are they? 
Henderson's men. 
He claims he's given them orders to kill you if I don't let him go. 
Is he bluffing? 
He doesn't do that, sir. 
CHLOE: Jack, I've got Heller's car. 
I'm patching it through to your PDA. 
Copy that. 
( helicopter propeller whirring ) Jack... they have a laser sight 
trained on me. 
Get up. 
You give me the recording, I let you go: that's the deal. 
No. 
Come on, Jack, you're wasting time. 
We both know you're not going to let Heller die. 
I can hear him, Jack; don't let him do this. 
I'm going to walk out of here, Jack, and you're not gonna stop me, so uncuff me. 
Jack, don't let him go. 
I don't have a choice, sir. 
Yes, you do. 
If I had listened to you in the first place, none of this would be happening. 
This is my responsibility, I will not allow Logan and Henderson to use me as a pawn. 
Sir? 
Do not let them get away with this. 
Make sure that the recording gets to the right people. 
Tell Audrey I love her. 
Mr. Secretary, 
what are you doing?! 
No. 
( engine revving ) ( helicopter propeller whirring ) JACK: Chloe, are you still on the line?! 
Can you confirm that Heller just drove his car into the lake? 
Yes. 
Damn you! 
Oh, my God, no. 
How could you do this? 
This isn't about what you think is best for the country. 
This is about your greed for power. 
Today, you have been responsible for killing an ex-president, David Palmer, and the secretary of defense, two real patriots. 
Damn you! 
What happened to you? 
Give me the recording. 
I don't have it. 
Where is it?! 
I'm not going to tell you, Jack. 
and you know that-- no matter what you do to me. 
AUDREY: Do it. 
Kill him, Jack. Do it! 
MAN: Yeah. 
Graham? 
Yes. 
You need to cancel the action against Henderson immediately. 
Why? 
He has the recording, but he's made arrangements to have it released if anything happens to him. 
You should have exercised more control over him. 
There's a limit to how much I can do. 
Apparently. 
Don't. 
Don't you use that tone with me. 
We've both made mistakes today. 
You're right, Mr. President, 
my apologies, but the fact is, I think we have a bigger problem than Henderson. 
What? What are you 
talking about? 
At least he can be trusted to act rationally, in his own interest. 
Unfortunately, the same is not true of your wife. 
My wife. 
Apparently, there's a secret service agent named Aaron Pierce who knows a little more than he should. 
He intends to share that with Martha. 
I'm well aware of that, and I've taken steps to deal with Agent Pierce. 
But the real problem is Mrs. Logan. 
She continues to talk, to ask questions, talk about her suspicions. 
People don't take her seriously. 
They think she's unstable. 
There are too many loose ends lying around. 
We cannot afford to have her pull on one and unravel everything. 
You think I don't realize that? 
I think you're in a very difficult position and that you have been hoping the situation with Martha would resolve itself, but it hasn't. 
You must silence her. 
I know. 
But I'll handle this myself. 
( flips phone shut ) MAN: Mrs. Logan, 
Agent Pierce was transferred. 
That's what you keep saying, but it doesn't make any sense, not at 1:00 in the morning. 
We work around the clock, ma'am. 
It's quite common for agents to get pulled off details at odd hours. 
Right when they're supposed to have a meeting with the First Lady of the United States? 
I don't know anything about a meeting. 
Well, I do! 
I found Aaron's phone laying on the ground, right where we were supposed to meet. 
Now, I want you to find Agent Pierce, and I want you to get him back here, right now! 
There's a glitch in the scheduling software, I can not pull that record up right now. 
And are these glitches quite common, as well? 
Actually, no, but... 
Mrs. Logan. 
I'm Agent Adams. 
I think I can explain everything. 
Well? 
This is a sensitive issue, ma'am. 
President Logan would like you to come with me. 
Ma'am. 
What is this "sensitive" information? 
Is it about Agent Pierce? 
I'm sorry-- you need to talk to the president about that. 
I'm asking you. 
Do you know where Aaron Pierce is? 
No, ma'am, I don't. 
Is this where my husband is? 
I want to talk to him. 
Charles? 
Hello? 
( dialing ) ( phone ringing ) Yeah. 
Henderson wasn't lying. 
He doesn't have the recording on him. 
Could it be in his car? 
No, he wouldn't have left it behind. 
There must have been some kind of a hand-off. 
What do you mean? 
Well, that would explain why he wasn't any farther ahead of me. 
when I left Van Nuys Airfield. 
He must have stopped and given it to someone. 
Okay, I'll back trace the route with the satellite, see if I can spot anything. 
Yeah. 
Jack, we're getting that recording and exposing Logan. 
I don't care how far I have to go or what I have to do, Do you understand, Jack? 
Yes. 
( phone rings ) Go ahead. 
Jack, you were right, I found the hand-off. 
Henderson stopped and rendezvoused with another car. 
I'm sorry I didn't see it before. 
Can you track the other car? 
BUCHANAN: We're tracking it now, Jack. 
It headed back to Van Nuys. 
Looks like the civilian side of the airfield. 
Pulled onto the tarmac. 
Whoever was in it got out and got directly onto the plane. 
Isn't air traffic still grounded? 
Yeah, this is not a commercial flight. 
I'll find out what I can about it. 
CHLOE: Jack, the plane is servicing. 
It's about to take off. 
Has Curtis been relieved of his duty, or is he still attached to CTU? 
He's at CTU, taking orders from Homeland Security, but I think we can trust him, Jack. 
Where is he? 
According to the deployment grid, he's 25 miles northwest of you, with a tac team. 
Bill, I want you to call him. 
Get him to this location as soon as possible. 
I want him to transfer Henderson and Audrey back to CTU. 
Are you sure that's a good idea? 
Logan's in control at CTU. 
Curtis will be able to protect them. 
Right now, it's our best chance to secure Henderson and get Audrey the medical attention she needs. 
Calling Curtis now, Jack. 
Thanks. 
What's happening? 
The person Henderson gave the recording to just boarded a plane at Van Nuys Airfield. 
Why aren't you going now? 
I'll go as soon as Curtis gets here-- he's not far. 
Jack, I'll be fine until then. 
I'm not leaving you here alone. 
Jack, if you don't get that recording, my father will have died for nothing. 
Jack... 
for me. 
Henderson is secure. 
When he regains consciousness, I don't want you going anywhere near him. 
You don't even talk to him. 
You understand me? 
I understand. 
We have to assume his people are still looking for him. 
They're gonna be monitoring all non-VPN cell traffic, which means, you can't make or receive any calls unless they come from me. 
Here's Wexler's cell. 
I've got the number. 
All right. 
Audrey, I don't feel right about this. 
I'm going to be all right. 
I'm so sorry. 
Jack, you have to go now. 
Jack? 
Make sure you get that recording. 
I will. 
Let me know as soon as you're done. 
Vladimir Bierko has regained consciousness. 
But we're still waiting for the medical assessment to be finished before we can begin the interrogation. 
Let me know when they give us the go ahead. 
Final protocol shifts. 
You can tell Washington the transfer of authority from CTU to Homeland is officially complete. 
Okay. 
Two hours ahead of schedule, Karen. 
That is remarkable. 
I'm sorry, my head is somewhere else. 
Where? 
We gave the President Bauer's location over an hour ago. 
We should have heard something by now. 
The military authority is handling Bauer. 
Yes, I know, but this doesn't make any sense. 
The President insisted we redirect our focus from Henderson to Bauer. 
We find Bauer, and then he hands the mission over to the military. 
Karen, we're out of that loop. 
( phone ringing ) ( beep ) Karen Hayes. 
Ma'am, we have a problem. 
Chloe O'Brian got out of holding, and as far as I can tell, she's not in the building. 
MILES: Not in the building? 
How's that possible? 
I'm still gathering the details. 
But I reviewed the surveillance tape, and it looks like Shari had a conversation with her, and Shari let her go. 
Shari didn't try to stop her? Why? 
I don't know. She 
won't tell me. 
I had security take her into custody. 
Good. Bring her up 
here right now. 
We need to focus on how we find Chloe now. 
My guess is she'll try to contact Bauer. 
I agree, but how? 
She was using CTU resources before to help Bauer. 
Maybe she'll try that again. 
Which means she could try to access our system remotely. 
All she needs is a laptop. 
That's right. 
She'll disguise her traffic. 
Can you get through that? 
I can trace her physical location by looking at the binaries. 
Do it. 
HAYES: Wait outside. 
Why did you let Chloe escape? 
She intimidated me. 
She intimidated you? 
Sit down. 
You are in a great deal trouble, Miss Rothenberg. 
You had better start talking to me now. 
She said she'd recommend me for psychiatric evaluation. 
I'd lose my job. 
I'm sorry, Miss Hayes. 
There's something wrong with me, I know that. 
Shari... 
And I should probably see someone... 
Shari! 
Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer? 
She thinks Jack is innocent. 
Based on what? 
Based on some absurd idea that President Logan framed Bauer. 
She even said something about President Logan being involved in the assassination of David Palmer. 
I mean, can you believe her? 
And people think I'm crazy. 
MARTHA: Damn it, open this door! 
MARTHA: I don't know what you think you're doing, but you'd better think again! 
Unlock it. 
MARTHA: Open it! 
( pounding ) Charles. 
I want that man arrested! 
And I want know where Aaron Pierce is. 
Shh. 
Martha, calm down. 
All right? 
Aaron's fine. 
I just transferred him back to Washington, that's all. 
In the middle of the night? 
Doesn't make any sense. 
And why am I locked in this room? 
'Cause we need to talk. 
About what? 
Martha, I've been wanting to tell you this, but I told myself that you were too fragile to handle it. 
But that's not the truth. 
The truth is, I've kept this from you because it's horrible and because it's ugly. 
What are you talking about? 
What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen. 
He put himself in harm's way, and he got involved with something that he shouldn't have. 
What are you saying? 
That I never authorized his death. 
You... mean... 
you know who killed David? 
Yes. 
How do you know that? 
He works for me. 
What? 
Martha, it's very complicated. 
What?! 
There's an explanation. 
What?! An explanation?! 
Oh, my God! 
Stop! 
Go to hell! 
Stop! You don't understand! 
Oh, my God! 
You're involved in David's murder. 
Martha... 
Oh, my God, oh, my God. 
( sobbing ): Why are you telling me this? 
Why are you telling me this? 
Because you're on your way to finding out the truth on your own. 
( sobbing ) And because you need to stop. 
Stop what? 
You have to stop asking questions, you have to stop talking about this to everyone. 
Never again. 
Martha, do you realize how traumatic this would be for the country if people were to find out? 
Oh, yes, we're worried about the country. 
Damn it, Martha! 
That's the most important part of this! 
This scandal would destroy the American people's faith in their government. 
It would destroy our credibility all over the world. 
You lied to me. 
Everything. 
This whole day has been one giant lie. 
What you've done makes me sick! 
Martha, enough! 
I know that what I did, what I allowed to happen, was a mistake. 
It was a terrible mistake. 
But it's done. 
Right now, I need you to swear to me that you will do as I ask... 
for the country, Martha. 
I've forgiven you many things, Charles, but not this. 
You've broken my heart. 
I'm looking at you... 
I hate you. 
But I will keep my mouth shut. 
Because the people of this country don't deserve to suffer. 
You do, Charles. 
RON: Are you sure we're going to get through this the way we planned? 
What does that mean? 
There's too many loose ends. 
What operation doesn't have loose ends? 
Of course we're not going to get through this the way we planned. 
No one ever does. 
I have never made a deal in my life that didn't feel like it was going to fall apart in the 11th hour. 
Now, if you don't have the stomach to deal with a few bumps, then this is not the room where you belong. 
And that goes for all of you. 
GRAHAM: You're starting to have doubts. 
I can smell it, and I don't like it. 
You need to remember the strength we had 18 months ago when we started this thing. 
We okay, Ron? 
Yeah. 
Think about your kids. 
That's what I do when I need to get focused. 
Yeah? 
The situation with Martha is taken care of. 
I spoke to her. 
And? 
And I made it very clear that if she continues with this behavior, I will send her back to the hospital in Vermont. 
Well, you were going to have her committed earlier today. 
But you changed your mind? 
It's because she found out the truth. 
And I decided I should keep her close. 
What if she finds out the truth again? 
She won't. 
And if she does, I will handle it, just like I have all day. 
Okay. 
Fair enough. 
You have done a remarkable job today, Mr. President. 
I will admit that. 
Thank you. 
It's about time I heard some words of appreciation. 
Oh, listen to me, we were just talking about how you've had to be on the front line through this, how you've had to get your hands dirty, while we could just sit back and watch from a safe distance. 
You've earned our trust. 
And I am sure... 
that you will do whatever it takes to keep your wife in line. 
Audrey. 
Where's Jack? 
Audrey. 
I'm sorry about your father. 
I never intended your father to get in the middle of this. 
I've known Secretary Heller a very long time. 
He's an honorable man. 
What time is it? 
It's ten to 12 minutes since... 
If those windows didn't collapse when that car hit the water, it could have created an air pocket or something. 
20, 30 minutes in a submerged car, even at 100 feet, if there was an air pocket. 
Stop it. 
Your father could be alive. 
( straining ) Secretary... 
Secretary Heller could be alive inside that car. 
If he's alive, you got to do something about it. 
I mean, if there's a possibility that he's living, you got to call military authority or the emergency services or something. 
I mean, for God's sake, he's your father. 
Stop it! Stop it! 
Stop! Stop! Stop! 
Stop talking! 
What, do you think I'm stupid? 
You want me to make that phone call so that your people can find me. 
Audrey, my people are going to find us anyway. 
And Jack's not going to stop all this. 
I'm trying to help your father. 
Your father's drowning in a car, and you're not doing anything about it. 
You're gonna live with that the rest of your life. 
Shut up. 
He is dying, and you are doing nothing, Audrey. 
You are doing nothing. 
I swear to God, not another word. 
( cell phone ringing ) Yeah? 
Jack. 
I've got a visual on the plane. 
It must be some kind of diplomatic flight. 
There's a lot of security on the ground. 
We have a problem. 
What? 
I've been tracking the helicopter that Henderson's men used to shadow Secretary Heller. 
And? 
It changed course, it's heading towards where Audrey's holding Henderson. 
How could they find them? 
CHLOE: I don't know maybe they're using satellite imagery, too. 
The point is, they're going to be there any second. 
Where's Curtis? 
Based on the speed of the chopper, he might not make it there before Henderson's men, Jack. 
Upload your visual to my PDA. 
Advise Curtis of the situation, I'll get back to you. 
( speed dialing ) ( cell phone ringing ) Jack? 
Audrey, listen to me. 
Henderson's men have zeroed in on your location, they're heading back towards you. 
You've got to get out of there now. 
And just leave him? 
JACK: We don't have a choice. 
Yes, we do, Jack. 
I have the gun and I can kill him. 
Audrey, we need him alive. 
Curtis's team is almost there, they'll track him down and they will secure him. 
You've got to get out of there. 
AUDREY: Jack, he's responsible for the death of my father's death. 
I can't just leave him here! 
JACK: Audrey, please, listen to what I'm telling you. 
You've got to start moving now. 
Audrey! 
HENDERSON: Stipes, get over and get these handcuffs off me. 
( metal clanking ) Heller's daughter's somewhere in this building-- kill her. 
Then get back here, we'll deal with Bauer. 
( muffled shriek ) ( whispering ): Audrey, it's me. 
Stay down. 
( gunfire stops ) Secure him for transport back to CTU. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
CURTIS: Hostiles are down and we have Henderson in custody. 
( sniffling ) ( speed dialing ) ( cell phone rings ) Yeah? 
AUDREY: It's me. 
What's happening? 
Curtis's team killed Henderson's men and they're taking Henderson into custody. 
Jack, I tried to shoot him, but I couldn't. 
The only thing that matters is that you're safe. 
I'm fine. 
You sure? 
Yeah. 
Okay, good. 
Let me speak to Curtis. 
Curtis? 
It's Jack. 
Go ahead. 
Yeah, Jack? 
Curtis, I want you to transport Audrey back to CTU as quickly as possible. 
And get her over to Medical. 
And I want you to tell Karen Hayes that no one is have access to Christopher Henderson. 
CURTIS: She'll be taken care of. 
But as far as Henderson goes, CTU is more interested in apprehending you than taking your advice. 
Just do what you can. 
I'll get back to you. 
( speed dialing ) ( phone ringing ) ( speakerphone beeps ) Jack, is Audrey all right? 
JACK: Yeah, she's gonna be fine. 
Curtis is in control of the situation. 
Chloe, what have you got on the plane? 
The details just came in. 
You were right, it is a chartered diplomatic flight, security-level eight, scheduled to leave at 2:00 A.M. or sooner. 
Okay, we need to find out who's onboard so we can try and figure out who Henderson passed off the recording to. 
I'll try-- it's not going to be easy getting past the State Department's firewall. 
I understand. 
Bill, see if you could slow down the departure of this flight so I can figure out a way to get on it. 
All right, Jack. 
There's a maintenance gate on the northwest side of the airfield. 
You should be able to get close to the plane there. 
I know, I'm there. 
Just get back to me as soon as you've got the passenger list. 
GUARD: All clear. 
Go ahead. 
( grunts softly ) Yeah? 
Jack, we've tried everything we can there's no way to delay the plane. 
It's taking off in less than ten minutes. 
Okay. 
Has Chloe got the passenger list yet? 
I still can't get past the firewall. 
Chloe, I need that list. 
Jack, I'm trying. 
( phone snaps shut ) ( computer chirps ) ( snapping fingers ): There you are. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah? 
I got O'Brian. 
HAYES: Did you find her on our system? 
Yes, she's using one of our nodes to try to log-in to the State Department network. 
Do we know why? 
No, but she was using a work around I'd never seen before. 
so I machine-coded a matrix to get through... 
Miles, we just need to find her. 
Where she is? 
I'm running a physical trace. 
It's a private house. 
Cross-referencing with property records. 
( computer beeps ) Karen... 
she's working out of Bill Buchanan's house. 
Are you sure? 
Positive. 
We have a Tac Team not far away. 
I'll dispatch them now. 
What's their ETA? 
I'm showing less then seven minutes. 
Good, keep me posted. 
( speed dialing ) NOVICK: Novick. 
Mike, it's Karen Hayes. 
Karen. 
How are things going over there? 
HAYES: It's a rough transition from CTU to Homeland, but we're getting through it. 
NOVICK: That's good to hear. 
What do you need? 
I need some clarification. 
We were sent over here on a directive from the White House, but we've been dealing exclusively with Vice President Gardner until about two hours ago. 
What happened two hours ago? 
The president called me himself and ordered me to arrest Jack Bauer on evidence he was unwilling to share with me. 
Yes. I know about that. 
Have you seen the evidence? 
No, actually, I-I haven't. 
HAYES: Mike... 
Who has seen it? 
I don't have a good answer for that. 
Are you telling me you're not in the loop? 
Actually... 
I don't even think there is a loop. 
The president is keeping his own counsel at the moment. 
That's a first. 
Yes. It is. 
Is there anything else you want to tell me? 
Uh, nothing that I can say with any authority. 
All I know is that... 
it's been a strange night. 
I see. 
NOVICK: I wish I could be more helpful. 
No, Mike, actually, you've been very helpful. 
Thank you. 
( dialing ) ( phone ringing ) ( speakerphone beeps ) Hello? 
HAYES: This is Karen Hayes. 
You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there. 
Karen, I don't know what you're talking about, Chloe's not here. 
Bill, stop. 
Miles traced Chloe through a remote node she's accessing. 
And if you don't believe me, tell her he used a machine-coded matrix to find her. 
Karen, why are you warning us? 
Because I may have made a mistake earlier. 
A lot of things have not made sense today, until Shari told me what Chloe said. 
About President Logan being... involved. 
I've got to go. 
Just get out of there, now. 
Chloe, we have to go. 
I can't leave yet. 
Jack needs the passenger list. 
Chloe, if they find you here, you'll be arrested. 
You have to go now! 
Not yet. 
It's the last one! 
Let's get this thing out of here. 
Jack, we've authenticated the thumb-drive data. 
Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military. 
Who is this Henderson? 
JACK: Someone I used to work for. 
Where? 
CTU. 
He's the man who recruited me. 
Things ended badly between us. 
What are accusing me now of, Jack, being in bed with terrorists? 
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program. 
HENDERSON: I've got to merge some files, find out who was working on this project. 
We need I.T. 
They're next door. 
I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the thumb-drives. 
CTU does not have enough information to hurt us. 
WOMAN: What about Bauer? 
Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead. 
Oh, my God... 
How could I be so stupid? 
( yells ) Mr. McGill, we think 
there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade. 
My people are not going to chase that white elephant. 
They're busy trying to locate 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas. 
Now let my people focus on their work, or I will have you escorted out of here! 
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU. 
What are you suggesting? 
Section 112. 
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles 
and Ms. O'Brian, 
put them in holding, and then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU. 
Lynn McGill,I'm relieving you of your command under the "incapacity clause" of section 112. 
Mrs. Logan is riding 
with the Suvarovs. 
Get my wife on the phone. 
The terrorists were very specific: if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, they're going to release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations. 
You need to get out of the car! 
We're under attack; we need backup now! 
( gunfire ) ( screams ) ( sirens approaching ) I thought we had an understanding. 
It happened outside of my authority. 
I told no one. 
If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens. 
Mr. President, this is our 
final conversation. Good-bye. 
No... Wait! 
How long has he been conscious? 
Ten minutes. 
Before you go in, you should be aware of something. 
Tony's been asking for his wife. 
He doesn't remember? 
He remembers the explosion, but that's all. 
We have to tell him Michelle is dead. 
No, absolutely not. 
He's undergone severe trauma. 
This kind of stress will raise his blood pressure and make the vascular damage worse. 
Please, just hold off on telling him until his condition has stabilized. 
Would you excuse us, please? 
Tony. 
How are you feeling? 
They told me they took Michelle to Cedars. 
Yes, they couldn't treat her here. 
Why? How badly was she hurt? 
Is she going to be okay? 
As far as I know, yes. 
What the hell's going on here, Bill? 
They killed President Palmer, and they tried to kill Michelle and me. 
David Palmer was the primary target. 
They killed him because he was going to expose someone inside Logan's administration. 
They set Jack up to take the fall. 
Did they get Jack? 
No. He's alive. 
He's working with us here on a provisional basis. 
Bill, I need to talk to Jack. 
You need to rest. 
No, I don't need to rest. 
I need to talk to Jack. Now. 
I'll tell him. 
Thanks. 
Could you do me a favor? 
Could you get a message to Michelle? 
Tell her I'm okay. 
I will. 
( softly ): Tony... 
we need you to get better. 
( indistinct police radio transmission) ( speaking in Russian ) ( crying ) Copy, Blacktop One. 
We're standing by. 
The Navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am. 
It'll take us back to the retreat. 
He... didn't warn 
the motorcade. 
Ma'am? 
Charles, he knew about the attack, and... 
he just let it happen, Aaron. 
That can't be true. 
He didn't just let it happen. 
He... 
He gave the terrorists the Suvarovs' motorcade route. 
Ma'am, why would he do that? 
( helicopter approaches ) How soon before you're ready? 
I'll be leaving in a couple of minutes. 
I just need to finish setting the arming mechanism. 
Make sure you place the canister to maximize casualties. 
It must look as if this is one of our primary targets. 
It'll be taken care of. 
OSTROFF ( over phone ): Yes? 
Do you have the key card yet? 
I'll have it within the hour. 
They're can be no miscues. 
I'm using up one of my canisters to create this diversion. 
Without the key card, it's all for nothing. 
Call me when you have it. 
I will. 
( phone rings ) ( sniffs ) Hello. 
I'm going to be there soon. 
Make sure you bring the money. 
You'll have it. 
And you'll have your precious card. 
Careful. 
It's all we got left. 
Don't worry about it. 
In a little while, be able to buy all you want. 
Mrs. Logan and the Suvarovs 
have been treated. 
The chopper is picking them up now. 
What do I say to my wife, Mike? 
She put you in an impossible situation... 
It's my job to handle impossible situations, and I failed, and not for the first time. 
Mr. President... 
I should never have given in. 
I should have ordered back the motorcade. 
Sir, with all due respect, you don't have time for self-recrimination. 
The terrorists' attack failed. 
We have to assume they'll make good on their threat to use the Sentox on American soil. 
Has CTU made any progress, or are they just waiting for the other shoe to drop? 
They're looking for a lead, working the scene where the motorcade was ambushed. 
Bill, they're airlifting the bodies of the terrorists to CTU. 
When will they be here? 
Any minute. I'm meeting 
them in the morgue. 
Let me know what you find. 
You got it. 
Jack's calling in. 
Put him on speaker. 
Jack, we're in an emergency briefing with department heads. 
Bill wants to put you on speaker. 
I thought Lynn took Bill off the active roster. 
AUDREY: Bill's been reinstated, and Lynn's been relieved of duty. 
Okay, fine. Put me on. 
All right. 
You're on. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
What did you find at Omicron? 
Christopher Henderson was responsible for setting up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox. 
He just tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker that the Sentox was developed in. 
I managed to survive, but unfortunately the servers that control the data were destroyed and Henderson managed to escape. 
Chloe, are you there? 
Go ahead, Jack. 
Can you hack into Henderson's office computer? 
I already did it. 
Henderson's home workstation is clean. 
He wiped his hard drive five minutes ago. 
There's still an active socket. 
What's that mean? 
It means he's exchanging data with an off-site link. 
Can you locate it? 
Yeah. The registry listing is 
5714 Tarawood Drive, Toluca Lake. 
Tarawood Drive? 
That's his home address. 
I'll send a tac team. 
No, Bill. 
I need to go in alone. 
Why? 
Henderson's good; he'll be able to detect a tac team moving in. 
How do you want to play this, Jack? 
He left me for dead. 
I'm the last person he expects to see. 
I should be able to walk up to his front door. 
All right. 
But I want you in constant contact with CTU. 
Right now, Henderson is our primary link to finding this nerve gas. 
I know. 
I'll get back to you. 
WOMAN: You've reached the private client line for Banco Buenos Aires. 
Please leave a message at the tone or press the star button for immediate assistance. 
MAN: Client identification code, please. 
Eight-four-seven-seven-C, as in "Charlie." 
How can I help you, Mr. Henderson? 
I'd like after-hours access to my personal safety deposit box, please. 
Buchanan. 
Bill, we found a schematic of some kind of ventilation system on one of the terrorists. 
It's from the Suvarov attack. 
Since that's the most efficient way to deliver the Sentox, this could potentially be their next target. 
Do we know what building the schematic is from? 
Not yet. But I sent a copy 
off to Building and Safety. 
They're running it against their archive. 
Upload it to Chloe and Edgar. 
I want them working on this, too. 
Better make it fast. 
There's a number handwritten in the margin-- 18:00 hours. 
That means the attack could happen in the next hour. 
Yeah. 
That was Curtis. 
He's going to upload a set of schematics to our server. 
This is the likely target of their next attack. 
There was a time-stamp on it. 
The attack could occur sometime in the next hour. 
Where is it? 
We don't know. 
The only thing Curtis could tell at first glance is that it's the ventilation system in some kind of industrial building. 
How big? 
Big enough to hold several thousand people. 
Let's find it. 
How you doing, Tony? 
Fine. 
Have you heard anything else on my wife's condition? 
I haven't heard anything new. 
Sorry. 
( panting ) Tony. 
You'll have to get back to Recovery. 
Get away from me. 
Mr. Almeida, please... 
I said get away from me! 
Tony, come on. 
Two cc's of Ativan. 
Michelle... 
Thank God that you're all right. 
Let go of me, or I'll... 
Martha, please... 
Listen, don't touch me. 
Martha, I'm sorry. 
I made a mistake. 
I didn't think that I had any choice. 
Charles... 
It isn't just that you... 
You didn't stand up to them. 
You should have stood up to them. 
Martha... 
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell you how glad I am that you're both all right. 
ANYA: Thank you. 
It was awful. 
I'm deeply embarrassed that something like this could happen on U.S. soil, 
but I promise you, whoever did this will be brought to justice. 
( speaking Russian ) Excuse me, Mr. President. 
Of course. 
We both know who is responsible for this. 
We believe it was the same group who attacked Ontario Airport this morning, but we thought that they were all killed in the siege. 
Obviously, you were wrong. 
The situation is much more serious than you know. 
These terrorists have possession of a military-grade nerve agent. 
And they've threatened to use it against the civilian population of Los Angeles. 
How long have you known this? 
We just found out about it. 
But given this change of circumstances, I'm asking you to honor the terms of our treaty. 
Allow my intelligence and law enforcement agencies access to whatever intelligence your security people have on these separatists. 
You will have our help. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr. President, I hope 
you won't find this offensive, but there's something that's been troubling me. 
What is it? 
Mrs. Logan-- her behavior. 
She has not been herself. 
I'm sure that she is very upset by what just happened. 
Yes, I imagine she would be, but I noticed this before the attack. 
From the time she entered the car with Anya and me. 
Yuri, the truth is, my wife has been under a doctor's care for quite a while now. 
She suffers from depression and anxiety. 
It's been very difficult for both of us. 
I'm sorry to hear that. 
Thank you. 
Guard said you wanted to see me? 
How long are you going to keep me here? 
You're not going out there any time today, Lynn. 
District Marshal's reviewing your case. 
I need to ask you a favor, Bill. 
I know I don't deserve it. 
I was unfair to you earlier. 
What is it? 
I need to make a phone call. 
Lynn, if you think you can get out of this with a few phone calls, you're mistaken. 
I won't let that happen. 
It's not that, I swear it. 
I'll give you the number, you can clear it yourself. 
What's this about? 
My sister. 
I need to talk to her about a personal matter. 
It can't wait a few hours? 
No, it can't. 
Bill, please, she's in a little bit of trouble and I'm the only one who can help her. 
I don't need to clear it. 
Get Mr. McGill a phone. 
Give him some privacy. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
( phone ringing ) Hello. 
Jenny, it's me. 
Listen, I don't care that you took my wallet. 
Keep everything that's in there. 
I just need to get my key card back. 
What key card? 
My CTU access card. 
It's of no value to you. 
It just lets me in and out of this building. 
Well, can't you just get them to give you a new one? 
I mean, that's what I did when I lost the key to my laundry room. 
Damn it, Jenny, this isn't a laundry room. 
This is a secure government building. 
Now, if you don't want me to call the police, you'll get me back the key card today. 
You hear me? 
Yeah, I do. 
Listen, I got to go. 
Where's that card from Lynn's wallet? 
Why? 
'Cause I want to give him back his key card. 
We don't need it. 
That's how I'm getting us all this money. 
You told me we were just going to take his cash and a credit card. 
Yeah, we're taking a credit card. 
$20,000 line of credit, right here. 
$20,000? 
Who's going to pay you that kind of money? 
Yes, Mr. President? 
I'd like to speak with my wife. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
She asked to be left alone. 
Evelyn, I want to see my wife now. 
Move away from the door. 
Sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in. 
I'm not anyone, Evelyn. 
I know, sir, but she specifically mentioned you. 
I have to get to a meeting. 
Would you please tell my wife that I would like to speak with her? 
Of course, Mr. President. 
Thank you. 
I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now. 
I want to know how he's doing. 
Is there a message you want me to get to him? 
If he's all right, tell him I'd like to see him. 
Chloe, come here. 
I think I got a match. 
There's a discrepancy here. 
That's because they're from two different layers. 
The one Curtis had was structural, but this is an electrical blueprint. 
You're right. 
Mr. Buchanan. 
Edgar matched the schematics we got from Curtis. 
Where is it? 
Tyler Memorial. 
Westwood. 
A hospital. 
Tell Curtis to activate a tac team. 
I'll call Tyler Memorial, tell them to evacuate. 
This is Bauer. 
I'm on-site at the Henderson house. 
Do you copy? 
Jack, we found intel in the body of a dead terrorist. 
There is going to be an attack. 
Where? 
Tyler Memorial Hospital. 
We think it's happening within the hour. 
Okay, I copy. 
I'm moving in now. 
Miriam... 
AUDREY: Who? 
Christopher's wife. 
He's not here. 
Tell Chloe I'll get back to her as soon as I have access to his computer. 
All right, we're on it. 
This is Curtis Manning with CTU. 
I need to speak to the ranking security officer on site. 
You're talking to him. 
Tom Wegman. 
Mr. Wegman, I'm heading to you 
now with a tactical team. 
The nerve gas will most likely be released into a ventilation unit. 
You need to seal off the sub-basement. 
I've called in a second security shift. 
Good. 
We'll get that area locked down. 
How long before the hospital's evacuated? 
Uh, an hour, maybe two. 
This attack could occur within the next 30 minutes. 
This is a large facility, Agent Manning. 
We have 600 patients, many of whom need assistance. 
Mr. Wegman, 
if this nerve agent is released into the ventilation system, everyone inside that building will die. 
Do what you have to do, but get those people out of that building. 
Right. 
Hello, Miriam. 
Oh, my God. 
We thought you were dead. 
Where is he? 
What are you doing, Jack? 
Miriam, where's Christopher? 
He's still at work. 
Did he call you? 
You're scaring me. 
In the last hour, has he called you?! 
No. 
Now tell me what the hell is going on. 
I need to see his computer. 
What are you doing? 
Where is his computer?! 
I'm not going to tell you anything until you tell me what is going on. 
Christopher developed a chemical weapons system called Sentox-VX nerve gas for Omicron. 
He enabled terrorists to gain control of it, now it's being used against civilian targets in Los Angeles. 
So where is his computer?! 
Miriam, I am telling you the truth. 
We have proof that he brokered the deal. 
That's impossible. 
Less than an hour ago he tried to kill me. 
Move towards the living room. 
Keep walking towards the den. 
I want you to take a seat on the couch. 
Look, why don't we just call him? 
I'm sure there's an explanation. 
Miriam, take a seat. 
You don't need the gun, Jack. 
You're not going to shoot me. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I need access to Henderson's hard drive. 
I need you to talk me through it. 
( knocking ) Yes? 
You wanted to see me, ma'am? 
Oh, yes, Aaron, come in. 
I-I didn't really get a chance to say thank you before. 
You saved my life. 
I know that you'll say it was all just in the line of duty. 
You're welcome. 
The country's lucky to have men like you. 
I'm lucky. 
I hope you'll allow me to say that. 
NOVICK: Mrs. Logan. 
Would you excuse us, Aaron? 
What is it, Mike? 
The President's been trying to reach you. 
I know. 
But I don't want to see him. 
Would you like me to convey that to the President? 
You can convey whatever you want, Mike. 
Mike... 
Mike, I want you to know nothing happened in there. 
Whatever didn't happen, make sure it doesn't happen again. 
( indistinct radio transmission ) Manning? 
Yeah. 
Tom Wegman, hospital security. 
Thanks for mobilizing your people so quickly. 
Have you uplinked with CTU yet? 
We're doing that now. 
We've doubled security at all sub-basement ingress points. 
Nobody's getting down there unless they go through us. 
Good. 
The bad news is we have 26 patients in ICU that can't be moved. 
Seven of them are high-dependency newborns. 
We can't even relocate them without the specialized transport units which we don't have on site. 
What about nearby hospitals? 
All neonatal transport units are in service. 
All right, thanks. 
I want a visual sweep of all high-probability target points within the hospital. 
Team A, start at the north end, Team B take south. Move. 
It's Viktor. 
I'm at the hospital. 
And why are you calling me? 
They must have found out about the attack. 
The hospital's being evacuated. 
All of the elevators and stairwells are guarded. 
Calm down, Viktor. 
Bring up the schematics of the hospital. 
There's another entrance to the sub-basement. 
An electrical conduit. 
There's a good chance it isn't guarded. 
How do I find it? 
In the Radiology wing down corridor six. 
Call us when you're there. 
We'll talk you through it. 
I'll call you in a few minutes. 
Viktor, I need you to finish this task, even if it means you don't get out. 
DOD just concluded a briefing with Russian Intelligence. 
We were given a name. 
Vladimir Bierko. 
He made billions in the postSoviet economy weapons and oil. 
He bankrolled several underground radical publications promoting the separatist cause, but it's believed that he was more than just a sympathizer. 
The Russians think he's financing these attacks? 
They think that he's directing the attacks himself. 
Based on what? 
A number of communiques that were intercepted by Russian security force, supported by the fact that Bierko vanished from Russia three months ago. 
We posted Bierko's profile to the interagency servers. 
Homeland Security has issued an emergency brief to local law enforcement. 
Do you think there's any hope of finding him before the attack on Tyler Hospital? 
The most promising lead we have is a man named Christopher Henderson. 
Unfortunately, he escaped. 
Jack Bauer believes there may be files on Henderson's computer that could lead us to Bierko. 
He's trying to acquire those files now, sir. 
Well, let's hope he succeeds, Bill. 
The country's already suffered three devastating attacks today. 
We need to stop this madman. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Have you found anything yet? 
The only thing on Henderson's hard drive is domestic stuff: bill-paying programs, downloaded music. 
Chloe, Henderson isn't trading music files with his office. 
There's something else on the computer. Find it. 
I'm doing the best I can. 
Why don't you face it, Jack? 
Christopher is innocent. 
He was innocent when you forced him out of CTU, and he's innocent now. 
Maybe you didn't hear me earlier, Miriam, he tried to kill me. 
If he did, then he was defending himself. 
No, he blew up the server room at Omicron while I was still inside. 
He was destroying evidence that would have implicated him in this conspiracy. 
This is so familiar. 
You're accusing him of being a criminal. 
Why do you hate him so much? 
I want you to know something. 
Chris never hated you, not even after what you did to him. 
When he thought you were dead, he looked in on Kim. 
He cared about your daughter, Jack, just like he cared about you. 
We both did. You know that. 
CHLOE: I found something, Jack. 
What is it? 
It's a shadow drive. 
It was partitioned from the primary hard drive. 
What's on the shadow drive? 
A backup log that contains data points for every satellite phone call Henderson has made in the last year. 
Can you cross-reference those numbers with the telephone numbers the terrorists used earlier this morning? 
I got into the log, but the phone lists are password-protected. 
Hold on. 
Christopher had a secret file on his computer. 
There's a list of numbers. 
And that implicates him? 
We need access to that list. 
Do you know the password? 
No, I don't. 
Miriam, we believe there's going to be another attack within 30 minutes. 
Thousands of lives are at stake. 
Please, if you know that password, I need it now. 
I can't help you. 
Chloe, you're going to have to try and hack into it. 
I'll see what I can do. 
Hurry. 
I'll show this to Manning. Good work. 
Agent Manning? 
One of our guards caught this. 
This guy's dressed as an orderly, but I've never seen him before. 
An orderly has no business being where he is. 
That was five minutes ago. 
Where is this? 
Sub-basement. 
Team A, meet me in the southeast stairwell. 
Team B, form a soft perimeter. 
We have a possible suspect in play. 
CTU, did you copy that? 
Yes, we copy. 
Edgar, I need you to uplink the hospital video surveillance for facial recognition software. 
See if you can get a match. 
Curtis has a suspect. 
We're running the image through facial recognition. 
Halfway through the database. 
Got something. 
All right, put it up. 
Curtis, we have a suspect. 
His name is Viktor Grigorin. 
He's a Russian national. 
Served time for drug smuggling and weapons trafficking. 
Copy that. 
All teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile. 
Repeat: a confirmed hostile. 
( faint clattering ) Freeze! 
Don't move! 
Agent Manning, you need to come look at this. 
Search him. 
Don't! It might be set to 
go off if it's moved. 
Chemical Response Team, we need you down here now. 
All teams, we've located the canister, and it is on. 
CTU, Chemical Response Team is on the way in. 
The hospital evacuation is still in progress. 
There are still a lot of people in here. 
Copy that, Curtis. 
Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies. 
I want a mandatory evacuation of the downtown core. 
Yes, sir. 
Jack, Henderson is using an interlaced encryption key. 
What does that mean? 
It could take me a half a day to crack it. 
Damn it, Chloe, we don't have that kind of time. 
I'm sorry. It's a little tougher 
than it looked at first glance, okay? 
Yeah. All right. 
Jack, you should know that Curtis and his team intercepted a terrorist at the hospital. 
Did they take him into custody? 
No. He's dead. 
But they found a nerve gas canister. 
They're trying to disarm it now. 
There are patients there that can't be evacuated. 
Chloe, listen to me. 
There's nothing you can do about the hospital. 
There's still 18 canisters out there. 
I need you to stay focused. 
I know. 
If I got you more personnel, would that help you crack the code faster? 
I've already got three analysts working on it, Jack. 
Miriam? 
Miriam? Honey, I want you 
to pack a bag. 
I want you... 
Don't you move! 
Miriam, sit back down! 
Put your hands behind your head. 
Get back up on your knees. 
Now! 
I want you to handcuff yourself. 
Behind your back. 
Get up. 
Take a seat next to Miriam on the couch. 
You okay, honey? 
Okay. 
How do I find the nerve gas? 
I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Where is it? 
That's right, Jack. 
Start at my knee, just like I taught you. 
Sooner you do it, sooner you'll see I don't know what you're talking about. 
Where is it?! 
He doesn't know, Jack! 
He doesn't know! 
For God's sake, leave him alone! 
Christopher, CTU found one of the canisters at Tyler Memorial Hospital. 
It's armed! 
People are going to start dying. 
How do I find the nerve gas? 
Jack, leave him alone! 
He doesn't know anything! 
You really trust him? 
Ask him what's in the briefcase. 
Unlock it! 
Ask him what he's doing with all the money! 
Ask him! 
Christopher? 
Is this true? 
Have you been lying to me all this time? 
I've been protecting you all this time. 
By lying? 
It's not that simple, Miriam. 
I defended you. 
I defended you, too, against things you would not want to know because I love you, Miriam. 
There's not one thing I've done out of self-interest or greed. 
Even when they fired me even when they framed me I served my country. 
I don't care how you justify this. 
I am out of time. 
You are going to tell me now how to find the rest of the nerve gas. 
Oh, go ahead and do it, Jack. 
Get it done. 
Shoot me. 
Kneecap me. 
Go ahead and do it. Do it! 
( shot fires ) ( screams ) You son of a bitch! 
I shot her above the kneecap! 
Son of a bitch! 
She can still walk! 
You make me shoot her again, she'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life! 
Damn you! 
Where do I find the nerve gas?! 
Damn you! 
Where is it? 
Please, please, baby. 
Don't you make me do this. 
Tell him what he wants to know. 
I can't. 
I can't. 
Forgive me, Miriam. I can't. 
You son of a bitch. 
( gasping ) You don't care about anybody. 
Not even her. 
Chloe, this is Jack. 
I need an ambulance on site. 
I repeat: I need an ambulance on site. 
Miriam Henderson's been shot in the leg. 
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson in to CTU. 
It's all right. 
I'll need an interrogation room prepped, and a medic standing by with hyocine-pentothal. 
It'll be ready when you get here. 
You okay, Jack? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Just get the ambulance here now. 
Team's on its way. 
Put Buchanan on. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
Jack's on line one. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
What's happening at the hospital? 
There's a CRT team on site. 
Stand by, Jack. 
Curtis, what's your status? 
We're still trying to defuse the detonator. 
Look what we found on the hostile. 
Hold on, Bill. 
It's a remote timing display. 
Can we defuse the detonator? 
Not in 60 seconds. 
We'll have to get it out of here. 
It could go off if we move it. 
( wheezing breaths ) It's a chance I'm gonna have to take. 
All teams, we're moving the canister to the containment unit. 
All right, go, go, go, go, go! 
Go, go, go, go, go, go! 
Move, move! 
All right, clear off! 
Clear off! 
Go, go, go! 
Get out of the way! 
Everybody clear! 
Go, go, go! 
All right, get 'em out of the way! 
Move! 
Move, move! 
Get that door open! 
( grunting ) Come on! 
Get that thing sealed! 
We're clear! 
CTU... 
the canister detonated inside a containment unit. 
The hospital's safe. 
Good work, Curtis. 
( muffled whimpering ) ( silenced shot fires ) ( screams ) ( whimpers ) ( silenced shot fires ) I have the key card. 
How long will it take for you to reprogram it? 
Five minutes. 
Then we will be able to use it to access CTU. 
Good. 
Has Bauer arrived at CTU? 
No, not yet. 
I need you to clear an entrance. 
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer? 
What the hell's going on here, Spenser? 
I was following orders. 
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer, they have a reason. 
BAUER: This man is a professional assassin. 
He just killed Dr. Paulson. 
He tried to kill me. 
Did you let him into CTU?! 
They told me he was here to place a tap on one of the servers. 
That's all I knew. 
Who told you? 
The White House. 
Mr. Gomez. 
David Palmer was murdered because he was about to expose Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists. 
You want the nerve gas? 
Cummings is your connection. 
McGILL: Cummings is the President's chief adviser. 
How exactly do you suggest we get to him? 
I could secretly meet with Mike Novick. 
JACK: Who did you tell? 
Who did you tell?! 
I didn't tell anybody, Jack! 
Tell your men to stand down! 
I'm sorry, sir. 
We can't do that. 
Put your hands in the air! 
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country by separatists who think they're going to use it against the Russians. 
However, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil. 
And you know this how? 
We control the remote detonators on those gas canisters. 
As soon as they've reached the terrorist base, we'll trigger the canisters by satellite and release the gas. 
You're a traitor. 
You'll let things play out as they are. 
Otherwise, your administration will be implicated, and your presidency will be destroyed. 
Mr. President, 
my name is Jack Bauer and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this. 
But your Chief of Staff is withholding information that is vital to this nation's security. 
Stop this! 
I'm done talking with you. 
You understand me? 
So for the last time, where is the nerve gas? 
Stop! Stop! 
Stop! Stop! 
I'll tell you! 
I'll tell you! 
It's on a freighter leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30. 
CTU, we've located the target container. 
No hostiles present. 
You have a green light. 
Take possession of the canister. 
Open 'em up. Let's go. 
Open 'em all up. 
Empty. Next. Moving on. 
What do we got, nothing?! 
There are no gas canisters here, CTU. 
The nerve gas is not here. 
Where are the canisters? 
I've told you everything. 
We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr. Cummings. 
Erwich, listen. 
We can negotiate something. 
I don't negotiate with my enemies. 
I eliminate them. 
Your country is about to pay a very steep price for betraying us. 
I was approached six months ago by a man named James Nathanson. 
He was my contact. 
Who is he? 
Former CIA. 
Said he was recruiting like-minded individuals for this initiative. 
"Initiative." 
Is that what you call this? 
You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas! 
I told you we were gonna trigger the canisters once the separatists reached their base in Central Asia. 
This was not supposed to happen. 
But it happened! 
You got into bed with these people, and now they're threatening to use the gas on American citizens! 
Oh, you make it sound like our goal was to kill Americans! 
What the hell was your goal, Walt? 
Explain that to me. 
We're patriots, Mr. President. 
We were acting in the best interests of this country. 
How is any of this in our best interest? 
Shoring up a strategic partner in the war on terror, ensuring a stable flow of oil. 
How is any of that not in our national interest? 
WOMAN: Chloe O'Brian's on the line. 
Chloe, are you set up for the trace? 
All set, Jack. 
We're ready to call Nathanson. 
How long do I have to keep him on the line? 
Until I give you a signal. 
Chloe, dial the number. 
The line's been disconnected, Jack. 
There's nothing to grab onto. 
They must know something went wrong. 
He's gone dark. 
Damn it, Walt! 
I don't want this weapon deployed on US soil any more than you do, but Nathanson cannot help you now and neither can I. 
These terrorists are operating on their own. 
Mr. President, I think 
he's telling the truth. 
He can't help us, not anymore. 
Aaron, get him out of here. 
Yes, sir. 
Jack. 
What do we do now? 
I need to be debriefed. 
After that, I'm leaving, sir. 
Given the current situation, things have become more complicated. 
CTU is gonna have to be responsible for the retrieval of the canisters. 
Why are you leaving? 
Sir, I have a daughter that doesn't know that I'm still alive. 
If I have to disappear again, in all fairness to her, I don't think she should know. 
Jack, terrorists just threatened to deploy chemical weapons on US soil. 
They have the ability to kill millions of people. 
I understand that, Mr. President, 
and I believe that CTU can handle this. 
Jack, your experience can make a crucial difference in stopping them. 
Look... you and I have 
a complicated history. 
I realize that. 
And I'm not naive enough to expect any special personal allegiance from you. 
But I know your respect for this office and your concern for this country is just as strong as it was when you served under David Palmer. 
I'm asking for your help, just until this crisis is over. 
I will reinstate you. 
I will give you all the support you need. 
Mr. President, you and I... 
Jack, please! 
For God's sake, we need to recover this nerve gas before it's too late. 
Micro-circuitry on this remote has been tampered with. 
As far as I can tell, unless we can repair it, we can't arm the canisters. 
Rossler will have a way. 
He should have called by now. 
Our real enemy is Russia. 
We should be figuring out another way to get back home, not wasting time trying to use the gas against the Americans. 
Question my orders again, and I will kill you. 
Do you understand? 
They've closed the ports. 
They will hunt us until they find us. 
So if we cannot use the gas against Russia, we will use it against America. 
Get up. 
( phone rings ) Hello? 
Lynn? 
Jenny, now is a really bad time. 
Yeah, I know you're busy, but I need to see you, please. 
What is it? 
I need some help. 
You mean money. 
Lynn, I'm clean. 
I'm working two jobs and busting my ass to put my life back together. 
How much? 
$500. 
Can I, can I come over there? 
Absolutely not. 
Why? 
Are you afraid I'll embarrass you? 
Yeah, I am. 
Lynn, I got nobody else to turn to. 
You know, I can't go back on the street again. 
If you don't help me, I swear I'm going to hurt myself. 
For God's sakes, Lynn, I'm your sister. 
All right, listen. 
Jenny, listen. 
There's a parking lot across the street from CTU. 
I'll meet you there in 20 minutes. 
Okay. 
Thank you, Lynn. 
( sighs ) Sorry I'm late. 
BUCHANAN: I was just explaining that Cummings provided us with a schematic of one of the canisters. 
Triggering mechanisms on the canisters can only be activated via satellite relay. 
Cummings says the terrorists have been given invalid detonation codes. 
Then these canisters are useless to them. 
Unless they can find a way to control the triggering mechanism. 
McGILL: Are we running evacuation scenarios? 
Evacuation isn't feasible, not without a time frame or a target. 
Erwich's threat was intentionally vague. 
What are we doing to track these canisters? 
Chloe? 
I pulled a voice print from Erwich's call to Cummings and I'm doing a scan of all satcom chatter. 
If Erwich is in contact with anyone on that bandwidth, we should be able to intercept and trace the call. 
We better get lucky 'cause we just got a new assessment from Civil Defense. 
They're estimating that the nerve gas from each canister will create kill zones between one and three square miles. 
The terrorists are in possession of 20 canisters. 
We're talking about potential casualties in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps over a million. 
( phone rings ) Yeah? 
Ivan Erwich? 
Go ahead. 
Jacob Rossler. 
I was asked to call you by a friend in Moscow. 
You've been briefed on our situation? 
You need to reconfigure the remote trigger for an Aatox chemical delivery system, right? 
Yes. 
You have the canisters with you? 
Yes. 
You'll need to start by cutting into them. 
Listen carefully to my instructions. 
( phone rings ) O'Brian. 
WOMAN: We just got a pattern match. 
Send me the hit. 
All interagency search protocols are being run through CTU. 
Ken, no one is going around you. 
All right, I'll make sure that you're apprised in real time. 
Audrey, I thought you should know. 
Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated on a provisional basis. 
He's been given full autonomy and access. 
We got a possible intercept on Erwich. 
This just happened. 
ROSSLER: On the inner casing, you will find a display window with a seven-digit readout. 
I'll need them. 
ERWICH: And then what? 
ROSSLER: I will program a new chip for your remote trigger. 
Put me through to Jack Bauer. 
Voice print is a 95% match. 
It's Erwich. 
EDGAR: He was on a sat-phone. 
I can't trace it, but the call originated from a landline downtown. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, we may have a lead on Erwich. 
I'm listening. 
We intercepted a call between Erwich and an unknown associate. 
We weren't able to trace Erwich, but we may have a location for the associate. 
22 North Figueroa, a penthouse. 
Chloe, bring up the building manifest. 
See who's in there. 
On it. 
From what we heard, Erwich is trying to acquire some kind of activation code. 
Yeah, he's trying to reconfigure the trigger mechanism so he can disperse the Sentox. 
Bill, we're running out of time. 
Okay, the penthouse is leased to a man named Jacob Rossler. 
Cross-checking. 
He's a software programmer indicted for high security code infiltration, identity theft. 
Never convicted. 
Okay, I'm gonna need schematics on the building and vectors for every entrance. 
We'll have it for you by the time you get there. 
Bill, we're going to need to go in covertly. 
Have Curtis meet me at the location with a small team of four. 
But tell them to stay out of sight until I get there. 
Right. 
We'll be in touch. 
This is our new destination. 
They'll clear a landing zone for you. 
Mr. Buchanan, this building's 
security system uses proprietary technology. 
It's a high-end platform. 
It's a bitch to hack into, especially with the time constraints we're under. 
So, get Edgar to help you. 
Spenser is better. 
Chloe, absolutely out of the question. 
CHLOE: Spenser can do this faster than Edgar and I put together. 
He wrote an infiltration code that took us four months to hack. 
That's a bad idea. 
CHLOE: Stay out of this, Edgar. 
He didn't know Cummings was dirty. 
His polygraph proved that. 
He's was spying on us. 
He was spying on you. 
He lied to you. 
Sir, if you don't let Spenser help us do this, we're not going to get it done in time. 
He has to wear a security wristband and be under constant supervision. 
Fine. 
( phone ringing ) Audrey Raines. 
Audrey, it's Jack. 
Hey. 
Listen, I wanted to tell you myself, the president asked me to stay on until the canisters were retrieved. 
I heard that you were reinstated. 
Jack, you know what this means. 
You'll be exposed. 
CTU can handle the crisis. 
Audrey, I have to do this. 
Jack, you don't owe them this. 
Listen, Audrey, the reason why I called: I need to ask you to do me a favor. 
What? 
Kim doesn't know I'm alive yet. 
I don't want her to find out the wrong way. 
Do you want me to tell her? 
No, I just want you to call her and bring her in to CTU. 
I'll see her when I get back. 
All right. 
Are you sure you're comfortable doing this for me? 
Of course. 
Thank you. 
Sure. 
Yeah. 
Well, your swing arm needs to be replaced. 
With parts you're looking at $475. 
Yeah. We're open 
till 5:00. 
Okeydoke. 
Can I help you? 
Do you have some kind of precision tool for cutting metal? 
Sure. 
Where is everyone else? 
Lunch. Why? 
I need you to do some work for us. 
And we need it done fast. 
If you do it, you'll live. 
Do you understand? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Just take it easy. 
Why haven't I gotten an update? 
Bauer left here on some sort of lead. 
Find out if CTU is any closer to recovering the nerve gas. 
Yes, sir. 
How are you feeling? 
Remarkably well... 
for someone whose husband tried to have her committed without so much as a good-bye. 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't come here to fight with you. 
You have every right to. 
The two of us used to be a pretty good team. 
Do you remember? 
I was the one you would always come to first for advice. 
I remember. 
We've got to get back to that relationship, Charles. 
You're right, things are going to get rough for you. 
And you are going to need me and everything that I can give you. 
I don't know what to say, Martha. 
Don't you ever do that to me again. 
( knocking ) Mike, please, come in. 
Mr. President. 
Mrs. Logan. 
Mike. 
Mike, I owe you a profound apology. 
You were in an impossible situation, sir. 
I understand why you did what you did. 
No. 
I panicked, Mike, that's it. 
Plain and simple. 
I'm not proud of how I handled myself. 
I intend to make it right from this point on. 
I'd like you to resume your duties. 
Of course, sir. 
Thank you, Mike. 
( sighs ) CTU is in the process of tracking down the canisters, but we still have to deal with the issue of Walt Cummings. 
It's all right, Mike. 
I would like Martha's input on this. 
So what do we do about Walt? 
We can't detain him indefinitely. 
Maybe not, but we can keep him out of sight long enough for us to construct a credible narrative. 
Mike... 
are you talking about a cover-up? 
I mean, exercising discretion to spare this country unnecessary humiliation. 
Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination. 
He has allowed these terrorists to get their hands on weaponized nerve gas that is at this point With respect... 
a very real and present threat With respect... 
Mrs. Logan, 
if we go public with Cummings, the president's reputation won't be the only casualty. 
The credibility of this office will be destroyed. 
Charles, you are going to take a hit on this. 
But you won't be destroyed. 
You did nothing wrong except to trust someone who betrayed you. 
You are human. 
You might be overestimating the public's capacity for forgiveness. 
No. I'm not. 
The only thing they won't forgive is being lied to. 
I think you should issue a statement to the press, and the sooner the better. 
I agree. 
Why don't you and I work on it together, see what we come up with. 
Great. 
Chloe. 
Go to Station 3. 
We don't have much time. 
Thanks for getting me reinstated. 
I only did it because I need your help getting Jack through the high-security building, not because I forgive you because I don't. 
Have a seat. 
We need to gain access to the security server at 22 North Figueroa. 
It's a proprietary network, so get to work. 
Chloe? 
I swear, I thought I was falling... 
I don't care, Spencer. 
( keyboard keys clacking ) CTU, they've got eyes and ears on building security. 
We have two units, one east, one west of the building. 
Chloe, do you copy? 
CHLOE ( on earpiece ): We're here, Jack. 
Spenser's countervailing the building's security protocols. 
What are you talking about? 
Spenser's under arrest. 
Buchanan released him from Holding. 
Fine, just give me Rossler's position. 
I've hacked into the building's motion sensors. 
According to them, Rossler is still in the penthouse. 
I have two guards on the penthouse level. 
What about the ground level entrance? 
SPENSER: There's one guard, three surveillance cameras. 
Okay. Stand by to take out 
all security cameras that are covering the front desk and the elevators. 
I can only shut them down for 60 seconds. 
After that, they will reboot automatically. 
That's as long as you have to subdue the lobby guard. 
Copy that. 
Teams A and B, you will remain in a holding position till you get a "go" code. 
We are three minutes out. 
We have to cross the street to get to Rossler's building. 
ROSSLER ( on phone ): Yes? 
We're ready to cut into the canisters. 
You have to cut precisely ten centimeters from the bottom of the casing to reveal the trigger. 
How thick is the outer casing? 
Five millimeters. 
Call me with the identification numbers when you're done. 
We're in position. 
We're set. We're ready to go. 
Give me a few seconds to access control. 
Okay. 
Here we go, Jack. 
On my mark. 
Camera's dark. 
Federal agent. 
Let me see your hands! 
Let me see your hands! 
Elevator code, let's have it. 
Uh... four, zero, 
seven, three, pound. 
Unit one, status check. 
Just lost cameras A and C. 
Tell him you don't know why the cameras went down, but everything is okay. 
Everything is okay. 
Status check: blue. 
Don't know why the cameras are out. 
Everything's fine down here. 
Turn around. 
Back up to me. 
Back up to me. 
Where are the elevators? 
The elevator's almost there. 
You have two floors to go. 
The camera reboots in ten seconds, then you'll be visible. 
( elevator bell dings ) Move. Move! 
Unit one, status check. 
Where are you? 
You tell him you had to use the men's room. 
Base, headed to the men's room. 
Something's wrong. 
( machine beeping ) ( phone beeps ) Yes? 
GUARD: Mr. Rossler? 
We may have a situation. 
What kind of situation? 
I'm not sure. 
Please remain in your office until you get the all clear. 
The guards look suspicious. 
One of them has an automatic weapon. 
Copy that. 
Federal Agents. 
( gunfire, shouting ) You okay? 
Yeah. Go ahead. 
Get my vest. 
Rossler's on the move. 
Where is he? 
9:00. 
( gunfire ) Federal agent. 
Drop the weapon! 
Drop the weapon! 
Put your hands behind your head. 
Do it! 
Interlock your fingers. 
Rossler is in custody. 
I repeat: Rossler is in custody. 
All backup teams move in. 
I need a medic. 
We're patching you into the Situation Room. 
Someone else is in the penthouse, Jack. 
Where? 
In the bedroom, to your right. North side. 
Curtis, cover him. 
I got him. 
Let me see your hands. 
Let me see your hands! 
Don't shoot. 
Who are you? 
I'm Inessa. 
Who did that to you? 
You are the police? 
Counterterrorist unit, Los Angeles. 
He is holding me here. 
I want to go home. 
You need to cut into the outer casing exactly ten centimeters from the bottom. 
The casting is five millimeters thick. 
You cannot puncture the inner lining. 
What's in these things? 
Don't worry. Just do what I say. 
Just... Can't you tell me 
what this is all about? 
Do you have a family, Cal? 
A wife. 
My wife is in prison. 
She's been there for seven years. 
Her only crime was to support me while I fought for my country. 
My son lives in a state-run facility He does not even remember what I look like. 
You want to know what this is about? 
Justice. It's 
about ending tyranny. 
When you're finished, we will leave. 
You won't hurt me? 
You're not my enemy. 
The government is my enemy. 
Hey. 
You have my word. 
Begin. 
It's all right. 
You're all right. 
Just take a seat. 
You're safe now. 
Have a medic take a look at her. 
I want CT to do a full background check. 
I don't mind that they've dressed his wound, but make sure they don't give him anything for the pain. 
Yes, sir. 
Curtis. Put him in a chair. 
All right, let's go. 
Get him up. 
Easy on my leg. 
CURTIS: Just get him over there. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm with CTU. 
25 minutes ago you contacted a man named Ivan Erwich. 
What did he want you to do for him? 
I want my lawyer. 
You'll get a lawyer as soon as I get what I need. 
Mr. Erwich is in possession 
of 20 canisters of Sentox-VX nerve gas, which he has threatened to deploy here in the United States. 
I guess you have a problem. 
No, sir. You 
have a problem. 
You've been conspiring with and aiding a known terrorist, which means I get to hold you for as long as I want. 
Now, we know Mr. Erwich 
can't deploy the canisters unless he reconfigures the trigger mechanism. 
Is that what he wanted you to do? 
Trust me. You don't want 
to go down this road with me. 
Go to hell. 
( yells ) That's exactly where I'm going to send you unless you start to cooperate. 
You like hurting girls? 
Curtis. 
( yelling ) JACK: When I finish with you, you're gonna wish you felt this good again. 
Where is Erwich?! 
( moaning ) I want full immunity. 
Unfreezing of all my assets. 
And transport to a foreign country of my choosing. 
No. 
I need Inessa. 
She comes with me. 
That's the deal. 
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. 
We're not making a deal. 
Curtis. 
( yelling ) ( yelling ) ( groaning and panting ) Jack, it's Lynn. 
Go ahead. 
We don't have the luxury to engage in brinkmanship. 
He's gonna tell us what we want to know. 
You may be right, but we're not gonna wait around to find out. 
Accept the deal. 
That's an order. 
Fine. It's your call. 
We're signing off. 
Make sure he follows through. 
I'll be back in a few minutes. 
I've been instructed to accept your proposal. 
A certified agreement, signed by the Attorney General. 
When I see that, I'll tell you what you want. 
But remember, I want Inessa. 
Your immunity agreement is being drawn up. 
Now I want something. 
Where's Erwich? 
I have no idea. 
I don't know the man. 
Not even what he looks like. 
I first spoke with him 30 minutes ago. 
We were put in contact through a mutual associate in Russia. 
Who? 
Sergei Voronov. 
He's a commander in the resistance movement. 
What's Erwich want? 
He wants to reprogram the chip of the trigger. 
He's calling me back with the identification keys. 
What's your time frame? 
Within the hour. 
How is he going to receive the package? 
I was going to deliver it. 
We haven't agreed on a meeting place. 
I want that chip. 
It's in a safe place. 
Once I see some paperwork, I'll show it to you. 
I want you to be ready to fit that chip with a transponder so we can track him. 
Okay. 
( touch tone beeps ) ( phone ringing ) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
Where are we with Rossler's immunity agreement? 
We have the Attorney General's sanction. 
You should have the documents in a few minutes. 
Okay, good. 
Did we get any information on the girl? 
There isn't much. 
Inessa Kovalevsky. 
Reported missing 19 months ago from Kiev. 
The assumption is, she was kidnapped by traffickers in the sex slave trade. 
She's 15, Jack. 
15? 
Okay, thanks, Bill. 
I'll get back to you. 
You can't take the girl. 
Then you don't have a deal. 
You'll have your immunity, your freedom. 
Leave the girl out of this. 
No. 
Inessa is all I care about. 
She comes with me, or you lose Erwich. 
( sighs ) I've almost finished compiling those surveillance protocols. 
Whatever you have, port it over to Edgar's station. 
Why? 
He'll be finishing that task. 
Fine. 
Chloe, don't you understand? 
I know. 
I'm glad you do. 
You don't work here anymore, Spenser. 
That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
What? 
Your reinstatement was temporary. 
Just until we got Rossler into custody. 
But there's still a lot of stuff that has to be done here. 
We pulled people from Division. 
We don't need you anymore. 
These men will escort you out. 
I know that was hard, but you did the right thing. 
Shut up, Edgar. 
You're right. 
We don't need that part. 
Okay, "I promise a full and open inquiry "into this matter. 
"I will not rest until I've restored "the faith that you have placed in this office, "and I can demonstrate to you, the American people, "that I bear its mantle of responsibility with respect and deep humility." 
See, this way, you're assuming responsibility for Walt's actions, but you're also personally taking the initiative to bring him to justice. 
Well, I'd like to run it by Mike, but I think it works. 
I think it's the right move, Charles. 
Thank you for letting me help you. 
I'm glad to have your help. 
Been a long time since you and I have worked together like this. 
( phone ringing ) Yes? 
Mr. President. Mike. 
What is it, Mike? 
I think you should come here. 
I'm in the west hallway. 
What's going on? 
Just come here, sir. 
I'm on my way. 
( machinery whirring ) ( whirring stops ) Good. 
Cut him down. 
Thanks for meeting me. 
You got the money? 
Jenny, I'm not here to bring you money. 
Here's the name of a doctor. 
He's a good man. 
I want you to call him. 
I'll pay all the expenses. 
It won't cost you a cent. 
We'll call him together. 
I can't. 
( grunting ) Don't hurt him. 
Oh, my God. 
Hurry up. 
( coughing, groaning ) Let's go. 
I'm sorry. 
Come on! 
( coughing ) ( groaning ) Rossler's been given a shot for the pain. 
We have air and land pursuit units on standby. 
As soon as he moves out, we'll be ready. 
No one's going anywhere unless Erwich makes that call. 
Stand by the phones. 
Excuse me. 
Audrey Raines. 
It's me. 
Hey. 
Did you manage to get a hold of Kim? 
No. I tried her, 
but she wasn't in. 
I left a message. 
Would you mind trying again for me, please? 
Sure. 
Okay, thanks. 
I want to contact my family. 
When can I go? 
I-I need to explain something to you first. 
Please, sit down. 
For now... 
we need you to go with Mr. Rossler. 
Just-Just for now. 
Men like me, agents, are going to follow you. 
And when we get what we need from Mr. Rossler, 
they're going to move in and they're gonna take you away from him. 
You don't know what he does to me when we're alone. 
I promise you, I won't let him be alone with you. 
I don't believe you. 
I won't do it. 
Please, let... 
Let me go. 
I'm sorry. I can't. 
Then you are no different than Rossler. 
I am not Rossler. 
Look at me. 
I won't let anything happen to you. 
I promise. 
We need you to get dressed, please. 
Thank you. 
( machinery whirring ) Good job. 
( silenced gunshot ) That's it. 
Load the canisters. 
Get rid of the body. 
( phone ringing ) JACK: Pick it up. 
Yes? 
We have the identification keys. 
I'm messaging them to you now. 
I've got them. 
How long will it take you to reprogram the chip and deliver it back to us? 
I'll be ready in ten minutes. 
You and I need a place where we can meet. 
You're coming personally? 
Unless you have someone who can install and program a coded binary chip. 
I'll call you back in five minutes with the location. 
I'll be here. 
Get him set up for a wire. 
I'll get the girl. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. Rossler, in a minute, 
we're going to be implanting a transmitter. 
We're ready to go. 
It's going to be fine. 
What's happening? 
Couldn't complete the trace. 
We've narrowed it down to a ten-block radius. 
( phone ringing ) Okay. Thanks. 
( gunshots, shouting ) No! Hold your fire! 
Get a medic in here now! 
Inessa, give me the gun. 
I know you don't want to hurt anybody else. 
I couldn't go with him. 
( gun hits floor ) Is he gonna make it? 
No. He's dead. 
Rossler was our only link to those canisters. 
Erwich's gonna call here any minute. 
He's gonna expect to talk to him. 
Jack Bauer is currently undercover with some of the terrorists. 
They're expecting Jack to help them release a single canister of Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall. 
Do you mean to actually let them release the Sentox? 
Are you out of your mind? 
We have the terrorists under surveillance. 
Even if they kill Bauer, we will be able to track them back to the remaining canisters. 
I'll go along with your assessment. 
Let them release the Sentox, but you'd better find those other canisters or those people will have died in vain. 
There is still time to move in and stop them before they murder all those people. 
Audrey, we have a directive from the President. 
Do you realize how many more people could die if these men don't lead us to the other 19 canisters? 
with that order, stand by and watch as they murder all those people? 
If those are the orders of the president? 
Yes, I would have to! 
The trigger's been reconfigured. 
You can activate the canisters now. 
Better hope it works. 
What's the unlock code? 
Jack, the unlock code is alpha-kilo-charlie. 
Ecko-bravo-charlie. 
Jack, this is a direct order from the president. 
Now enter the correct code and let them release the gas. 
Now! 
Make it work! 
I told you there's nothing I can do! 
They have another way to release the gas. 
( hissing ) I managed to stop the flow of gas, but some got into the air system. 
We need to evacuate the mall now. 
What about the terrorists? 
One's dead, one escaped. 
Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger. 
The hostile that escaped still had it on him. 
I managed to activate the valve before I got away. 
At least some of the gas was released into the mall. 
What do you want me to do? 
Come back here. 
You were followed. 
You know what to do. 
( gunshot ) No! 
Hostile down! 
Erwich is gone, the canisters are gone. 
We've got nothing here. 
Damn it! 
REPORTER: Despite an attempt by extremists to derail the process, the treaty was signed earlier today by President Logan and Russian President Yuri Suvarov. 
Officials from each country are hailing the agreement as a major milestone in U.S.-Russian relations. 
The White House Press Secretary has called this a critical achievement in diplomacy and will set the course for President... 
Sentox gas is genuine. 
The test was successful. 
I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees. 
And you waste it killing a handful of American civilians. 
We were betrayed, Bierko. 
Someone must pay. 
I agree. 
You were the one who trusted the Americans. 
Nathanson lied to us. 
He plotted to turn the gas against us. 
Your trust nearly cost us everything. 
Since I anticipated this, I have secured additional men and resources at great personal expense. 
Have you found a way to reconfigure the canisters with dispersal mechanisms? 
Yes. 
Do it. 
Nathanson will be eliminated. 
Then we will return to our original task striking at the heart of Russia. 
Where's Nathanson? 
I don't know where he went. 
I swear, I don't. 
( exhales ) ( gunshot ) ( dialing phone ) ( phone ringing ) Yeah. 
I took out Nathanson's men. 
But there is no sign of Nathanson. 
Find him. 
( dialing phone ) ( phone ringing ) Alpha-seven. 
This is Nathanson. 
Someone just took out my men. 
Who? 
I think Bierko's hitting us back. 
Destroy all your databases. 
( gunshot ) I know you're there, Jenny. 
Pick up the phone. 
Damn it, Jenny, I need the keycard from my wallet! 
Look, I'll leave the police out of this. 
You and your loser boyfriend can keep the money you stole, max out my credit cards, I don't care. 
Just give me back my keycard. 
It's important. 
We can't sell the keycard. 
Why can't we just give it to him? 
I'm calling my brother. 
No, you're not. 
What is going on, Dwayne? 
I'm handling this. 
( phone rings ) Jenny? 
SECRETARY: Please hold for the President. 
LOGAN: Have your people recovered the nerve gas? 
McGill? 
Yes, sir. 
I'm here. I'm sorry. 
( clears throat ) Do you have any leads? 
Have you intercepted the terrorists? 
( sighs ): No, sir. 
The man we followed from the mall took his own life before he could be apprehended. 
Damn it, McGill, I put this on you. 
If you'd let the terrorists release the Sentox gas in the mall as I agreed to let you do, we wouldn't be where we are right now, which is nowhere. 
Mr. President... 
Stop! 
LOGAN: Stop making excuses. 
Take responsibility and do your job. 
( phone beeps off ) Although we were able to limit the casualties, the attack at the mall indicates that these terrorists intend to make good on their threat to release the nerve gas on U.S. soil. 
Unless we catch a break, we can expect to suffer multiple attacks, resulting in mass casualties. 
I assumed you'd want me to start without you. 
Just tell me where we are. 
LAPD is setting up a perimeter around the terrorists' last known location. 
We've activated all search protocols, including satellite and Caltrans surveillance. 
But we don't have any real leads, do we? 
( scoffs ): If Jack Bauer would have followed orders and maintained his cover, we could have intercepted these people. 
We don't know that for sure, Lynn. 
What we do know is, Jack's field decision saved over 800 innocent people. 
It may well cost us 100 times that many people. 
In the meantime, we've contained both the physical threat and the media's awareness, which would have triggered massive civil unrest. 
Well, you tell yourself that if you want to, Ms. Raines, but the 
fact remains that these terrorists are at large with 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas, and we don't know where or when they're gonna hit us next. 
We're all aware of the threat, Lynn. 
Then why does she keep defending Bauer? 
I want Bauer placed in custody. 
I want him brought in here. 
I want him held responsible for what's happened. 
Jack can be disciplined later. 
Taking him out of the field right now is a mistake. 
Don't tell me how to do my job. 
He was authorized by the President, Lynn. 
But he works for me, and so do you. 
I want him here now. 
The rest of you, maintain your search protocols. 
Send your progress reports to my screen in ten minutes. 
It's all right. 
We're all under a lot of pressure. 
Let's get back to it. 
( phone ringing ) Manning. 
This is Buchanan. We have orders 
to bring Jack in. 
We weren't able to find anything that confirmed this guy's identity. 
I want you to take his picture, lift his prints, get him over to CTU as soon as possible. 
We've got nothing on this guy. 
We're gonna have to run him through NCIC and Interpol databases. 
I just got off the phone with Bill. 
Lynn McGill wants me to bring you back to CTU. 
He's on some kind of warpath. 
Why? Because I didn't think 
letting terrorists release Sentox nerve gas in a crowded mall was an acceptable loss? 
And because we lost our only real lead, and Lynn's looking for someone to blame. 
I was appointed by the President of the United States. 
It was a field call. 
I know. 
And between you and me, I think you made the right call back at the mall. 
I'm calling the President. 
Look, Jack, the trail's gone cold. 
There's no point in fighting it. 
Let's just go back to CTU and square it. 
Fine. 
Look, I'm sorry, but I also have to take your gun. 
Jack, don't make this any more difficult than it already is. 
Fine. 
We can't afford to decommission Jack, especially now. 
I agree. 
What can we do about it? 
Nothing... 
while Lynn's in charge. 
He may be in charge, Bill, but he is not in control. 
Ms. Raines, you have 
a call on line one. 
Thank you. 
I'll be filtering intel at Station Three. 
Audrey Raines. 
NATHANSON: Ms. Raines, if you try 
to trace this call or put anyone else on the line, I will hang up. 
Who is this? 
My name is James Nathanson. 
I'm sure Walt Cummings has already told you all about me. 
You're the one who sold the nerve gas to the terrorists. 
That's close enough to the truth. 
What do you want? 
Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line. 
Why Jack? 
That's not your concern. 
You're getting to Jack through me. 
That makes it my concern. 
I'm going through you because I know you have a special relationship with Bauer. 
I know all about you, Ms. Raines. 
Which is why I'm counting on you to recognize an opportunity when it presents itself. 
What opportunity? 
I can help you find this nerve gas. 
How do I know you're telling the truth? 
You don't. 
Now put me through to Bauer. 
( phone ringing ) This is Bauer. 
Jack, I know you're with Curtis, so I'm assuming that you can't speak freely. 
It's Audrey. 
It's personal. 
Go ahead. 
Thanks. 
I'm on the phone with a man who claims to be James Nathanson. 
He was Walt Cummings' contact. 
He says he has information about the terrorists, but he will only talk to you. 
Why me? 
NATHANSON: You can hang up now, Ms. Raines. 
My phone has a node monitor. 
I'll know if anyone else comes on this line. 
Jack? 
That's all right, Audrey. 
Hang up the phone. 
All right. 
What do you want with me? 
Protection. 
The terrorists you're after are trying to kill me. 
If the terrorists figured out that you were the one who rigged the canisters of Sentox to blow up in their faces, what do you need me for? 
Just turn yourself in to the authorities. 
They'll protect you. 
Walt Cummings isn't the only one behind this operation who works inside the government. 
I need your help. 
You conspired to have me take the fall for President Palmer's assassination. 
What makes you think I'm not going to kill you myself? 
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas from being released on American soil. 
So do I. 
Where are you? 
There's a phone booth on the south side of Moorpark, just east of Densmore. 
Be there in ten minutes, or I'll be gone. 
Moorpark and Densmore. 
Got it. 
Jack? 
Audrey, I'll explain everything as soon as I get back to CTU. 
Thanks. 
It's going to be strange for her. 
Audrey. Just yesterday, 
she thought you were dead. 
Yeah. 
I know it's none of my business, but she's a good person, Jack. 
I hope you two get half a chance. 
Thanks. 
( grunting ): Jack! 
Don't fight, Curtis. 
Don't fight it. 
Lynn McGill. 
It's Curtis. Jack escaped. 
What? 
He got a call from someone.The next thing I know, 
he blindsided me,took my car. 
Who called him? 
He said it was Audrey, but he may have been lying. 
Lynn? 
We can try to track him using your vehicle's onboard transceiver. 
I just tried bringing it up on my PDA. 
He's either disabled or shut down the transceiver. 
Curtis,how could you let this happen? 
I'll get dispatch on it. 
One of my team's en route to pick me up. 
We'll find him. 
You don't even know where to look. 
Get back to CTU. We'll deploy from here. 
Damn it. 
Chloe,run a triangulation on Jack Bauer's cell phone. 
 Find out where he is. Yes,sir. 
Have you talked to Jack since he's been in custody? 
No. 
Well,he's not in custody anymore. 
He assaulted Curtis and stole his car. 
Why would he do that? 
Maybe you can tell me. 
I don't know where Jack is, if that's what you're asking me. 
You have no idea what he's doing? 
No,but I'm sure there's an explanation. 
Mr. McGill,we're not getting a signal from Jack's cell. 
The sim card must be out of his phone. 
Well,if you think of anything you'll let me know,right? 
Of course. 
Thanks. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe,what I'm about to tell you needs to stay between us. 
It involves Jack. 
What is going on? It just came on my screen that Jack's gone missing. 
He's following a lead on the Sentox gas. 
He needed to go alone. 
I just transferred a call from my station to him. 
I need you to delete the record. 
If Lynn finds out we're working behind his back... 
Chloe,I know. Believe me,I know. 
But this is the only way. 
There isn't a lot of time. 
When did you make the call? 
Communications archive. 
This is Lynn McGill. 
Bring up the phone logs at the station Audrey Raines is using Yes,sir. 
I found the transfer.I can't dump just the one call. 
They're all cross-indexed. 
Can't you unlink it? 
No. It would take like two hours. 
Okay,Mr. McGill, 
the call logs should be on your screen. 
Scroll through to station five. 
That's the one we dedicated to the DOD. 
The only way to get rid of the entry is to dump the entire log... all the calls you've made and received today. 
Do it. 
It's done. 
Thank you,Chloe. 
...a day that will long be remembered as a step forward for both the United States and Russia. 
President Logan and President Suvarov are expected shortly to deliver their closing remarks. 
Following this, the Russian head of... 
What is it now,Mike? 
I'm sorry,sir,but there's a call you need to take.It just came in on this. 
And what is that? 
Walt Cummings' phone,sir. 
It's been in Secret Service custody. 
They just brought it to me. 
The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas. 
Is someone tracing the call? 
They can't. 
It's being sent through multiple relays. 
I'm not talking to a terrorist. 
You talk to them. You find out what he wants. 
Mr. President,he's demanding to speak with you. 
All right. 
But put him on speaker. 
This is President Logan. 
Is this Erwich? 
Ivan Erwich is no longer with us,Mr. President. 
His attack on your shopping mall was unsanctioned and unwarranted. 
It didn't serve our interests. 
What is it you want? 
What I want is to release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow. 
Since that is now impossible, I'm forced to strike at Russia on foreign soil... 
with your help. 
My help? 
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade. 
His entire route to the airport, along with a full profile of his security detail. 
I...I don't personally have that information. 
Then get it. 
Make no mistake,Mr. President, 
it's our Russian oppressors I mean to hurt,not your people. 
However,if you refuse to cooperate, I will have no choice but to release all of the Sentox gas in areas far more populated than your shopping mall. 
You just said that killing Americans didn't serve your interests.This... 
this would be senseless murder. 
Yes,it would. 
So give me Suvarov's route. 
I'll need some time. 
You have 15 minutes. 
I'm... I'm not sure... 
He wants to assassinate Suvarov. 
We can't let that happen. 
If the Russian president is killed on U.S. soil, 
it wouldn't just nullify the treaty... 
it would destroy our relationship with Moscow. 
Get me Suvarov's route from Secret Service. 
Mr. President... 
No,I haven't made any decision yet,Mike, but whatever I decide,I'd better have the route in hand when he calls back,don't you think? 
Yes,sir. 
Somebody's screwing with me,Bill. 
I won't tolerate it. 
Screwing with you how? 
Audrey Raines' phone log has been erased. 
What? 
Take a look. 
Probably a system glitch. 
It wasn't a glitch. She did it on purpose. 
Audrey? You think Audrey did this? 
I know she did. That's ridiculous. 
She's one of the most by-the-book people I know. 
when you're trying to hide something. 
Did you know that she was on the phone with Jack right beforehe attacked Curtis? 
No,I didn't know that. What... what does that prove? 
There's something going on with these two. 
What's their history? 
You know their history,Lynn.They worked together at DOD. 
There's more than that,right? 
It got personal later on,Lynn.- NPersonal? 
And you didn't think it was important to tell me that? 
No,I didn't. 
What difference does that make? 
When did she find out Jack was still alive? 
This morning,with the rest of us. 
You sure about that? 
I was there,Lynn. I saw her reaction. 
Could have been an act. 
You're starting to sound paranoid. 
I don't care how I sound. 
From this point on, I want all our people on a tight leash. 
If someone has a hidden agenda, I want to know about it. 
CTU's become way too porous, and that's your fault,Bill. 
I don't need to hear this from you. 
You don't want to hear this from me? 
Then tell me why Audrey erased her phone logs. 
I'm here. Where are you? 
In a minute. First,I want to make sure that you weren't followed. 
Otherwise,there's no deal. 
Take the alley between the two buildings across the street from you. 
I left the gate open. 
Listen to me. 
I don't know what you think I can do for you, but you committed treason. 
I don't see it that way. 
I love this country. 
You're never going to be able to justify killing David Palmer. 
That was an unfortunate necessity. 
We admired Palmer,but we had other priorities. 
This country needs a reason to secure its oil interests in Asia a reason that Russia and the rest of the world can get behind. 
I've heard your reasoning from Walt Cummings. 
It's still treason. 
No. It's realpolitik. 
Do you see the open door ahead? 
Yeah. 
Enter it,make two right turns, and walk back the direction you came from. 
Hold on. 
You have hostiles coming in after you. They are not CTU. 
Do you have a weapon? 
Yes.Where are you? 
Second floor. 
Try and make your way to the roof.I'll meet you there. 
Stay on the line. All right. 
All right. I understand. 
Audrey. 
DOD wants a fuller explanation about what happened at the mall. 
I told them we're still trying to find a thread on the nerve gas. 
I just spent the last five minutes getting grilled by Lynn. 
About what? 
You and Jack. 
Your relationship. 
What'd you tell him? 
The truth. 
That you and he were once romantically involved and now I'm not sure. 
I don't see how that's any of his business. 
He thinks it is. 
He thinks you had something to do with Jack breaking from custody. 
Did you? 
Not exactly. 
What the hell does that mean? 
A man claiming to be James Nathanson called here about 20 minutes ago. 
He said that he had information on terrorists. 
That he would only give it to Jack. 
Why didn't you tell me about this? 
I was afraid of losing this lead. I didn't know what to do,Bill. 
So Jack's meeting this man Nathanson alone,without backup. 
 Where is he?  I don't know. 
Nathanson dropped me from the call. 
Who else knows about this? Just Chloe. 
 She helped me cover the call from Lynn.  Audrey. 
If you could just,uh,sign right here. 
District elevated the threat level. 
I'm briefing first responders on the high probability of multiple attacks, so I need to review DOD protocols. 
All right,I'll send them to your screen. 
We can do it here. 
Unless you have a problem working with me on this. 
No. No,no,it's fine. 
Excuse me. 
Bauer? 
Yeah,where are you? 
I'm in the freight elevator. 
You need to get out of there now. You're cornered. 
Bauer,where are you? 
I'm almost there. Just keep moving. 
Nathanson,stay down! 
Stay down! 
Nathanson! 
Look at me. Look at me. 
How do I find the canisters of Sentox? 
How do I find the canisters? 
In my pocket. 
What's on the chip? 
Please.What's on the chip?! 
Nathanson's dead,but there was someone else there. 
Who? 
I don't know yet. 
But he took out three of my men and disabled the helicopter. 
Nathanson may have given him information that compromises us. 
Keep looking until you find him. 
Some critics have already said that by signing this treaty, we as the United States are taking on our ally's enemies as well as having to deal with our own. 
Diagram Seven lays out the hierarchy for first responders. 
Civil Defense protocols for each agency are pretty well defined. 
Shouldn't you get that? 
Audrey Raines. 
It's me.Nathanson's just been killed, but he gave me intel. 
I need you to uplink the data. 
Sorry,Steve,you have the wrong extension. 
I'll transfer you to I.T. 
Overlapping responsibilities default to federal,then to state. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe,it's Jack. Audrey just rolled my call over to you. 
What the hell's going on over there? 
It's Lynn. He's been shadowing her. 
He thinks that she's been talking to you behind his back, which I guess she has. 
Chloe,listen to me. 
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox. 
I need you to data mine the files. 
Upload the drive to my socket. 
Access code 5J55J. 
Hold on. 
You should be getting it now. 
Chloe,I need you to keep this under the radar. 
You mean keep it from Lynn. 
At least until we know what we've got. 
My number come up on your screen? 
Yeah. 
Okay,I had to switch out phones. If you need to get ahold of me, 
call me back on that number. 
Okay,I will. 
Suvarov's motorcade, with his security detail. 
Sir... 
If President Suvarov is killed, and the Russians find out we supplied his killers with this information, it would be considered an act of war. 
The Russian motorcade has a significant security force. 
I see no reason to believe that the terrorists would even be successful. 
Maybe we should have an analysis done, determine,uh,uh, the vulnerable points along the route. 
Sir,we can't do that without giving away the fact that we had advance knowledge of an attack. 
What attack? 
It's-It's nothing that you need to be concerned about. 
Charles,you invited me into this circle. 
What attack? 
The terrorists want the Suvarovs' motorcade route. 
They've threatened to deploy more Sentox gas if I don't give it to them. 
You're not... 
seriously considering it,are you? 
Martha... Charles believes 
an assault on the Suvarovs has a good chance... 
Mike,will you please let the president speak for himself? 
May we have a moment? 
Charles. Martha,please. 
If I don't give them the information they want, tens of thousands of Americans will die on our own soil... 
maybe hundreds of thousands... and I will be responsible. 
All right,all right,all right, Charles,Charles, there has got to be another way. 
You change their itinerary, delay Suvarov from leaving. 
It's all over the news that the Russians are leaving after we make the joint statement. 
If there's any deviation from that,the terrorists will know that I've alerted them. 
Charles,what are, what are you telling me? 
What are you saying? 
That we are going to stand in front of the entire world with the Suvarovs,you're going to look him in the eye, shake his hand,knowing you're sending them to their deaths? 
If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this ultimatum,do you think that he would spare us? 
I am not talking about Russia. 
I am not talking about Suvarov. 
I am talking about you. 
You are the president of the United States of America. 
My God! Charles! 
You're talking about murder! 
Martha,my back is up against the wall. 
You... Give me another solution. 
You stand up to them. 
Refuse to negotiate with them. 
Isn't that the policy of this country? 
Isn't that the point of the treaty you've just signed? 
It's not that simple,Martha. 
It never is. 
Oh,damn it. 
Buchanan. 
This is Chloe. 
What is it,Chloe? 
Jack just sent me the data he got off Nathanson. 
My decryption filters weren't working and I just realized why. 
The drive's DOD formatted. 
DOD? 
Yeah. I don't know how Nathanson got his hands on a highly classified government t-drive. 
Audrey's the only one with clearance. 
Lynn's got her tied up. 
Exactly. 
How much time do you need? 
To decrypt all the vectors? 
Two,three minutes. 
Hang on. 
Lynn,do you have a minute? 
What is it? 
You were inquiring about a security breach with the phone logs. 
LYNN: That's right. 
...The archive room? Are you sure? 
BUCHANAN: We can key in the user I.D. 
from your office and find who we're looking for. 
We just have to use your key card. 
LYNN: Why are you so interested in this? 
I'm serious about all breaches of security. 
What was that? 
What? 
That last window you closed... what was it? 
It was just the DOD protocols. 
What is going on here? 
Lynn,will you please just calm down? 
LYNN: Don't tell me to calm down! 
The two of you are up to something and I'm not gonna stand for it. 
I think you're protecting Audrey and she's protecting Bauer. 
Look,I can explain,Lynn. 
So can I. 
This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority. 
Lynn,we are all on the same side. 
If your father wasn't the secretary of defense, I'd have you thrown out of here. 
I don't have that problem with you. 
Can I have Security to Station Five,please,right away. 
What are you doing,Lynn? 
Place Mr. Buchanan in custody and take him to holding. 
You are making a mistake - NAudrey. 
I want everyone's attention. 
I'm putting a section two-three redundancy into effect as of this moment. 
All of your stations will be mirrored and monitored through my office. 
Now get back to work. 
We need Bill to get through this crisis. 
You are jeopardizing our chances of finding that nerve gas. 
I will make sure that DOD and the Secretary of Defense are aware of that. 
Don't threaten me,Ms. Raines. 
I promise you,you do not want to threaten me. 
What do you got? 
The decryption element kicked out a company called Terra-Dyne. 
Over the past three years, they've acquired more than 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope, used to create Sentox nerve gas. 
Where do I find Terra-Dyne? 
La Ca~ada. 
It's a subsidiary of a larger corporation called Omicron International. 
Hold on,did you say Omicron? 
Yeah. Are you sure? 
What's wrong? 
Pull up their senior executive roster. 
See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list. 
Why? 
Just do it,please. 
Okay,here it is. 
Christopher Henderson, Senior Vice President of Research and Development. 
Do you know him? 
Yeah,I did once. 
Listen,send me the decrypted files over to my PDA. 
It's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now,Jack. 
Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk. 
Well,can Buchanan help you?- He could if he weren't in holding. 
What are you talking about? 
Lynn detained him for insubordination. 
How could he do that? 
Because he's losing it. 
I think the President's putting too much pressure on him to get those canisters. 
He can't handle it. 
Chloe,I still need the decrypted files. 
You're gonna have to find a way to get them to me. 
I'll try. 
They haven't called yet? 
Not yet,sir. 
President Suvarov's waiting. 
We'll be out in a minute. 
Martha... 
please? 
This is a difficult decision for me... 
both politically and personally. 
And maybe I won't have to make it. 
Maybe CTU will find the canisters before the Suvarovs have to leave. 
That's what I'm praying for. 
But whatever happens, I need you to understand. 
I do. 
I understand,Charles,I do. 
Mr. President. 
SUVAROV: It has been a challenging day so I especially appreciate how professional you have all been. 
Your president is fortunate to have such talented people working for him. 
Thank you. 
Yuri. 
Anya. 
Mr. President,I'm glad we have this opportunity 
to thank you and Mrs. Logan personally for your hospitality. 
( cell phone rings ) LOGAN: Mr. President it's been our pleasure. 
SUVAROV: Anya and I hope that you will visit us soon... Yeah 
Hold on. 
We would love that. 
Wouldn't we,Martha? 
Yes. 
It would be lovely. 
Martha... thank you again for being so kind. 
SUVAROV: I read the text of your statement. 
It was excellent. 
And congratulations again on your brilliant handling of the crisis at the airport. 
Thank you,Yuri. 
And-And thank you for your steadfast support. 
Have there been further developments? 
No,no,not at all. 
There's always pressure,huh? 
But everything's under control. - yes 
Ladies,the photographers are waiting. 
Thank you,Mr. President. 
The motorcade will take service roads to the 118, then to the 5 Freeway... 
Charles... 
Martha,please,just... just smile and wave. 
The motorcade will take Suvarov through this downtown corridor. 
That will give us our best shot at destroying all the vehicles. 
Tell our people this is where I want them to strike. 
All right,that's it,folks. We need to move. 
Charles,you can't let them get in that car. 
It's not too late. 
Mr. President,Lynn McGill is calling from CTU. 
What about? 
He didn't say. He just asked to speak with you directly. 
Excuse me. 
Mr. President,I'm afraid I have to say my good-byes here. 
Affairs of state,you know, the pressure's continuous. 
Yes,I understand,of course. 
Thank you,President Logan, for everything. 
Thank you. 
Anya. 
Charles. 
Mrs. Logan. 
Aaron,I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs. 
You could have a car follow us. 
We're not detailed for that. 
I'll ride up front. 
No,Aaron,no,that's not necessary. 
Yes,it is. 
Would you... 
tell my husband where I am? 
I hope you don't mind if I accompany you. 
You sure your husband won't mind? 
No,of course not. 
This way,we'll have more time to talk. 
Ma'am,the President is being briefed by CTU right now. 
But I left word for you. 
Thank you. 
What happened to David Palmer wasn't supposed to happen. 
He put himself in harm's way, and he got involved with something that he shouldn't have. 
You know who killed David? 
He works for me. 
MARTHA: You lied to me. 
This entire day has been one giant lie! 
What you've done makes me sick! 
Martha, enough! 
I need you to swear to me that you will do as I ask for the country. 
I hate you. 
The situation with Martha is taken care of. 
There are too many loose ends lying around. 
We cannot afford to have her pull on one and unravel everything. 
She won't. 
I have the recording. 
Have you destroyed it? 
No, sir, I have not. 
You and I have been in this from the beginning. 
Destroying that recording protects both of us. 
I've got O'Brian. 
Where is she? 
She's working out of Bill Buchanan's house. 
Did Chloe tell you why she was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer? 
'Cause she thinks Jack is innocent, that President Logan framed Bauer. 
This is Karen Hayes-- Miles traced Chloe to your house. 
You have less than seven minutes to get Chloe out of there. 
Karen, why are you warning us? 
Because I may have made a mistake earlier. 
Chloe, if they find you here, you'll be arrested. 
You have to go now. 
Not yet. 
BAUER: It's over, Christopher! 
Turn around! 
Give me the recording. 
I don't have it. 
Where is it?! 
BAUER: Henderson wasn't lying. 
He doesn't have the recording on him. 
There must've been some kind of a hand-off. 
Henderson stopped and rendezvoused with another car. 
Can you track the other car? 
We're tracking it now, Jack. 
It headed back to Van Nuys looks like the civilian side of the airfield-- pulled onto the tarmac; whoever it was got out and got directly onto the plane. 
CHLOE:It is a chartered diplomatic flight. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, we've tried everything we can. 
There's no way to delay the plane. 
Okay, call me when you've got 'em. Yeah. 
Bill, are you out? 
The field team's almost there. 
Chloe's packing the comm gear she needs to stay in touch with Jack. 
Where is Jack? 
Van Nuys Airport. 
He stowed away on a diplomatic flight that just took off. 
What? Why? 
He's trying to find a recording that implicates President Logan. 
And someone on that flight has it? 
Yes, and we don't know who. 
That's what Chloe's been trying to find out. 
Hang on. Yeah? 
Field team's a block away from Buchanan's. 
I'll set up here for the remote debrief of O'Brian. 
No. Put it in 
the Situation Room. 
Oh, I thought you wanted... 
I want it in the Situation Room. Go. 
Bill, the field team's gonna be there any second. 
Get Chloe out of there now. 
How close are they? 
One block. 
All right, I'm gonna have to run interference. 
It's more important that she gets away. 
Good. I'll bring you in. 
You'll be treated as a suspect. 
We never talked. 
BUCHANAN: Understood. They're here. 
Out the back. 
Bill, wait. 
Have Chloe call me on a dry channel. 
Either one-five or two-seven. 
Dry channel, one-five or two-seven. Got it. 
There's a gate in back. 
Follow the path between the houses to the alley, turn right and go to Ventura Boulevard. 
What about the curfew? 
There's a hotel on the boulevard, the Miramont. 
You should be able to make it there without being spotted. 
What about you? 
I'm gonna make sure you're not followed. 
I'll be at CTU, probably in Holding. 
Why in Holding? 
Karen's gonna place me under arrest. 
If you need anything, contact her. 
Why is she... 
Chloe, please, just go. 
( knockingat door ) Who is it? 
MAN: Homeland Security. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
we need you to open the door. 
We're under order from Karen Hayes. 
I'll be right there. 
What, uh, what's going on? 
Please step aside, sir. 
We need to search the house. 
No, I'm not stepping aside. 
Do you have a warrant? 
Where's Chloe O'Brian? 
I have no idea. 
Sir, don't make us use force we know she's been here. 
Look, I don't know what you're talking about. 
Where is she? 
I don't know where Chloe O'Brian is. 
She's gone. 
Sir? This is a recent 
file from Comm. 
Only O'Brian could access it. 
Talk to us, sir. 
I'm not talking to you. 
I'll talk to Karen Hayes. 
Mr. Papazian, 
we are on site-- it appears Chloe O'Brian was here, but she is gone. 
Is Bill Buchanan there? 
Yes, sir. 
We lost O'Brian. 
Damn it! 
Put him on the phone, please. 
Hello? 
Don't play games with me, Bill. 
Just give me O'Brian's location, or I will make it very bad for you. 
From what I understand, Miles, she got out of CTU right under your nose. 
You're the one who ought to be concerned, not me. 
Bill, this is Karen Hayes. 
Tell us what you know now. 
Stop wasting our time. 
I'm not saying any more. 
This is Ed. 
Ed, bring Buchanan in. 
Set up a grid search for Chloe. 
She's probably got a car, which means she's about 15 miles out. 
Copy that. 
But the agents on site are trained for interrogation. 
Why are you bringing him in? 
Because I want to run this, Miles. 
But now it's us who are wasting time here. 
Don't worry. 
I will make him talk. 
I'll be in my office. 
( phone line ringing ) HAYES: Yeah? 
I'm set up at the Miramont Hotel. 
Make sure no one looks for me here. 
I'll take care of that. 
Tell me what else you need. 
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520. 
Pull up the manifest. 
Got it. Flight 520 to Frankfurt. 
Okay, put everything you've got from that flight under the shared volume so I can get to it. 
Crew, passengers, cargo, everything. 
Done. 
Okay, I see it. 
Thanks. 
( phone rings ) ( panting ) Yeah. 
CHLOE: Jack, are you okay? 
I'm fine. 
Did you get what I need? 
I've got the passenger list it's gonna take some time to cross it against Henderson. 
What about the air marshal? 
That I'll have in a couple of minutes. 
Okay, good. What's 
happening at CTU? 
They're still under orders from the president to stop you, but Karen Hayes is backing us. 
Openly? 
No, but she's letting me help you. 
If there's proof against Logan, she wants it found. 
The proof is on this plane. 
Check the flight manifest, figure out which passenger has a connection to Henderson and get back to me with the air marshal's seat number. 
I will. 
I don't think so. 
Oh, hey. I was 
just asking. 
You don't have to go all feminist on me. 
Did you see that? 
21st-century woman. 
We better get used to it. 
( computer beeps ) ( phone rings ) Yeah. 
Jack, I found the air marshal his name is George Avila. 
He's sitting in 7A. 
Anyone sitting next to him? 
No. 
Okay, good. 
Get back to me when you've got the connection to Henderson. 
Got it. 
( quietly ): Excuse me. 
Is that seat taken? 
No. 
Thanks. 
The stewardess said I could change seats-- I was next to the galley, it's kind of noisy. 
I'm trying to get some rest. 
Yeah? 
Okay, the man you're looking for is in seat 12D. 
His name is Hans Meyer. 
He's with the German government. 
He's been connected to Omicron since the mid-1990s. 
He's worked directly with Henderson. 
That's it. 
Okay, I've got it. 
Mr. Meyer? 
Yes? 
My name is George Avila. 
I'm the air marshal on this flight. 
What's wrong? 
It's nothing serious. 
We found something that we think is yours. 
It should have been in the baggage compartment. 
We'd just like you to come back to the galley and identify it for us so we can properly stow it. 
Please, sir. We'd 
really appreciate it. 
If you have any carry-on bags, you should bring them with you. 
I don't. 
Very well. 
What makes you think it was mine? 
Ticket stub. 
They have taken away all my medication. 
I need to get to it. 
I'm sorry, ma'am. They won't 
let me give that to you. 
What do they think I'm going to do? Kill myself? 
Over that son of a bitch?! 
I just called the president of the United States a son of a bitch. 
No reaction? 
He must have some kind of law on the books against that, or am I immune, just like he is? 
Do you have a first name, Agent Adams? 
It's Justin, ma'am. 
You don't have much of a personality, do you, Justin? 
This is Novick. 
It's Martha. 
Are you still in the retreat? 
Yes. I'm just down the hall 
from your room. 
I need you to come here right away. 
I'll be right there. 
They've cut me off from my medication. 
You haven't been cut off. 
Dr. Hill said you had enough 
in your system right now. 
You need to wait a few hours. 
I don't want to wait a few hours, Mike. 
I need something now. 
What's going on, Mrs. Logan? 
I don't need counseling, Mike. 
I just want a damn pill. 
Sit down. Sit down. 
Thank you, Agent Adams. 
We've been through some tough times before, Martha. 
Just follow the doctor's orders for now. 
This is more than just a tough time, Mike. 
None of this is going to go away. 
I just have to live with it. 
What do you mean, "It's not going to go away"? 
What are you talking about? 
I... I shouldn't have said that. 
Martha, it's me. 
Say what needs to be said. 
What needs to be said I can't say to you. 
Why not? 
Listen, Mike, I just... 
I just need to get some sleep. 
I'm just... 
My nerves are shot from today. 
I just need something to calm me down. 
I just need to get to my medication. 
The president doesn't want you to leave the room. 
Then you can bring it here. 
I just want to take a couple of pills. 
I need to sleep. 
You can watch me take them. 
I'll see what I can do. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
GRAHAM: They found Bauer yet? 
No, they haven't. 
That's not good. 
I know that's not good. 
I'm putting pressure everywhere I can. 
I don't think I have to tell you how disastrous it would be if Bauer gets his hands on that recording. 
That's exactly right. 
You don't have to tell me. I know. 
When I find him, I will call you. 
Is there anything else? 
No. 
Good. 
Mr. President? 
What is it, Mike? 
There's something I think I should call to your attention. 
Yes? 
Your wife is in a very agitated state. 
I don't know how to proceed. 
Proceed with what? 
She wants me to bring her her medication against doctor's orders. 
That's all I need right now is to deal with her! 
No! No! 
No more pills. 
And she shouldn't be wasting your time with this anyway! 
Mr. President. 
Is there something going on that I should know about? 
Why? What did she say? 
She needs more medication to calm herself down. 
Something's clearly bothering her, but she didn't want to talk about it. 
I don't see where any of this becomes your business, Mike. 
I'll tell you where, Mr. President. 
I'm your Chief of Staff. 
If there's something going on that I don't know about that involves national security, it is my business. 
This isn't national security, Mike. 
It's our marriage. 
I think both of us realized today, at this point, our relationship is nothing more than a facade, and one that we're going to have to keep up for as long as I'm president. 
I think that she's reacting to that, Mike. 
I see. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
Mike? 
Give her what she wants. 
Lord knows, she's in a lot of pain. 
( groaning ) Where are you hiding it? 
Hiding what? 
What-What do you want? 
What the hell is this? 
I know who you are. 
I know your connection with Omicron. 
I know your history with Christopher Henderson. 
He asked you to take something out of the country for him. 
Where is it? 
Christopher Henderson? 
I have not seen him in months. 
Don't you lie to me! 
I'm not lying, I swear! 
I know Henderson, but I don't know what you're talking about. 
Did you check your luggage? 
Yes. 
Find it. 
Move! 
What are you doing? 
Nothing. 
Homework? 
Homework, yeah. 
I didn't know they had WiFi in here. 
Could you leave me alone? 
I can't talk right now. 
( laughs ): You're a little, uh, freaked out because of the curfew thing. 
Join the club. 
Yeah, okay. 
When you come up for air, I'm buying. 
MAN: Airport Customs. 
This is Chloe O' Brian from CTU Los Angeles. 
I need to talk to somebody in passenger clearing. 
I'll need verification. 
Agency ID: CTU 99A-12. 
( bell dings ) The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign, as we are expecting some turbulence. 
Please return to your seat and make sure your seat belt is securely fastened. 
( rumbling ) ( rumbling ) The passenger in 12D must be in the forward lavatory. 
You should get him out. 
The captain said it's going to shake pretty hard. 
There's nobody in those. 
I just checked. 
Then where is this guy? 
MAN: I don't know. Maybe 
he changed seats. 
( loud rumbling ) ( screaming ) ( quietly ): Call the captain, and tell him the air marshal's down, and a passenger's missing! 
What's going on here?! 
Please be seated, sir. 
Now, sir! 
Yeah? 
Captain Cotter, this is Dan. 
The air marshal's been assaulted. 
What? 
Assaulted? 
What's going on back there? 
I don't know, sir, but he's been knocked out, and a passenger's missing. 
Okay, okay. Secure the cabin. 
Keep the passengers under control. 
What's going on? 
There's a problem in the cabin. 
Make sure our door is secure. 
It is. What kind of problem? 
The air marshal's been knocked out. 
Call L.A. Center, 
get vectors for an emergency return. 
Mr. Avila, what happened? 
The man seated next to me where is he? 
I didn't see him. 
We got to find him. 
Damn it. 
What? 
Mike, come in. 
So, do you have something for me? 
This is just enough for a couple of days. 
Dr. Hill's going 
to come in... 
Thank you, Mike. 
Thank you. 
I'm going to get ready for bed now. 
Is there something else? 
Yes, there is. 
Earlier you said something to the effect that I didn't know everything that was going on. 
I was confused. 
I wanted my pills. 
I don't think so. 
Are you calling me a liar? 
I just spoke with the president. 
And I got the same feeling from him I get from you. 
Which is? 
That you're both covering something up. 
You know, Mike, I'm the one around here who's supposed to be paranoid, not you. 
I know you, Martha. 
And I know the president. 
He said this was all about marital difficulties. 
I think there's something else. 
What is it? 
Don't shut me out. 
Maybe I can help you. 
There is something else, Mike, but it's between me and Charles. 
If that changes, I promise I'll let you know. 
I don't know what you think Henderson gave me. 
I saw no one. 
I was picked up at the Consulate and brought directly here. 
There are witnesses, you can ask them. 
Is this your only piece of luggage? 
Yes. 
If you're lying to me, I'll find out. 
I am not lying. 
Please, if there is someone on this plane that has something you want, it is not me. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah. 
Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer is our guy. 
Why not? 
The timeline doesn't match. 
He's been in customs for the last three hours clearing himself onto the flight. 
The plane's turning. 
What does that mean? 
It means they know I'm on board. 
Chloe, keep looking. 
Okay. 
( metal rattling ) Are you sure he's down there? 
There's nowhere else he could be. 
Tell the pilot he can do it. 
But there's a passenger down there with him. He'll die. 
There's over 50 passengers up here. Call him now. 
Do it. 
Captain, the air marshal says the baggage area is secure, and that you should begin. 
( gasping ) ( loud hissing ) Air's coming in. 
It's not coming in, it's going out. 
What do you mean? 
They're depressurizing this area. 
What's going to happen to us? 
If we don't get into the main cabin, we're going to lose consciousness. 
( phone ringing ) Jack, what's going on in the plane? Security net just issued 
a bulletin. 
Chloe, I need you to patch me through to the pilot. 
I don't know if I can do that. 
Chloe, they're depressurizing this area. 
We're going to lose consciousness. 
Okay, okay. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah, Chloe. 
Jack needs us to patch him in to the pilot of the flight. 
Can you get through on a CTU sub-channel? 
I'll try. Hold on. 
I'll stay on the line. 
MAN: Air control operator 44. 
Yes, I need you to patch me through to the pilot of diplomatic flight five-two-zero out of Van Nuys. 
Hey, what do you got? 
A little voice-over IP going on there? 
Please leave me alone. 
No, seriously, I can help. 
I know a way for you to get some free bandwidth. 
Really? 
Absolutely. 
Sit down. 
Cool. 
Wow, nice piece. 
Never seen one of these before. 
What is that? 
( electrical crackling ) It's a CTU Series four. 
Chloe, they've opened the line to the pilot. 
I'll patch him through. 
Thanks. Okay, Jack, I'm putting 
you on with the pilot. 
Go ahead. 
This is Captain Stan Cotter. 
Who am I speaking to? 
Captain, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm with the counterterrorist unit in Los Angeles. 
I'm the man in your baggage hold. 
What do you think you're doing? 
I'll explain everything in a moment, but you're going to have to restore air pressure to this area. 
Sir, I remind you, I am a federal agent. 
What kind of a federal agent knocks out an air marshal? 
I don't believe you. 
Sir, I was patched through to you by a CTU sub-channel. 
I couldn't have done that unless I had clearance. 
All I know is, you have a gun and you have breached airplane security. 
Captain, this is a matter of national security. 
Now open the damn hatch! 
( air hissing ) What do you think? 
He couldn't have patched in through CTU if he was hostile. 
There's no point in taking a chance. 
In a couple of minutes he'll pass out. 
From there, the air marshal can handle it. 
Captain, we are running out of air down here. 
( air hissing ) Captain, I know you can hear me. 
There is a man on board your plane that is a danger to you. That's why I am here. 
Open the hatch! 
I can't do that. 
Okay, you son of a bitch. 
( air hissing ) ( shouting ) What the hell was that? 
The aileron conduit's been breached. 
What?! 
What the hell do you think you're doing? 
You're going to kill everybody on this plane. 
That's up to you. 
Open the hatch. 
I'm not letting you up here. 
Then you'll be responsible for everything that happens. 
( people screaming ) All right, all right, all right. 
Sue, I'm going to stabilize the pressure and I'm letting him up. 
I want you to unlock the hatch. 
The cockpit's secure. 
He can't get in here. 
Yes, Captain. 
What do you think you're doing? 
The captain ordered me to open the hatch. 
Both of you, turn around and grab the wall. 
Now! 
You... 
in the baggage hold. 
Do it. 
Now. 
Close it. 
Lock it. 
Out of the galley now. 
Get back to your seats. 
What's going on? 
Sit down! 
He has a gun! 
( people screaming ) Everybody just stay in your seats. 
Face forward. 
Put your hands on your head. 
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt. 
If you don't, people will start to die. 
Get the captain on the phone now. 
Sir, he's in the main cabin. 
He has a gun. 
Get the first-class passengers, move them into the main cabin. 
Everyone to the main cabin. 
Captain, this is Jack Bauer. 
I want to assure you I have no intention of hurting any of your passengers. 
I need to find something that's on the plane. 
It's a matter of national security. 
What do you want, Bauer? 
I want you to remain in a holding pattern so I can search your passengers. 
If you're really a federal agent, then you know I have to land this plane. 
Sir, that won't give me enough time. 
That's not my problem. 
I have a gun. 
Your air marshal is down. 
Captain, it is your problem. 
You need to remain in a holding pattern, do you understand me? 
You do what you have to do, Mr. Bauer. 
My job is to land this airplane. 
And that is what I am going to do. 
Captain? Captain... 
MAN: That's all we have on Flight 520, sir. 
Okay, look, I want updates on the situation on a minute by minute basis if necessary. 
GRAHAM: Yes. 
I just got word from the FAA about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight that left Van Nuys a half hour ago. 
So what? 
Jack Bauer is the hijacker. 
What is he doing on that flight? 
Looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer's death. 
Henderson handed it off to somebody before he was arrested and Jack must know that it's on board. 
Then you shouldn't be wasting your time talking to me. 
Order the plane down, and grab Bauer before he can hurt us. 
Wait, what are you saying? 
That he hijacked the plane? 
Not exactly. 
He has control of the cabin. 
The pilot is landing the plane. 
What about that recording? 
He's still looking for it, but there's no guarantee he'll find it before the plane lands. 
And after that, it's all over. 
The president will have his people arrest Jack at the airport and isolate him. 
What are we supposed to do? 
Just keep helping Jack. 
Chloe, I need to see that evidence. 
Call me if you need anything from here. 
Fine. 
Give me a second. 
What's Bauer doing on Flight 520? 
You have no idea what you're dealing with, you little ass-kisser. 
You don't talk to my people like that, Bill. 
Take him to Holding. 
It's no wonder CTU fell apart under that guy. 
Miles, I know you're trying to help, but I'll take it from here, okay? 
WOMAN: Western Operations. 
This is Miles Papazian, Homeland Security, Los Angeles. 
Pass code 21 double six. 
Put me through to Mike Novick. 
One moment, please. 
Yes, Miles. What is it? 
I need your input, sir, because I'm having a problem with Karen Hayes. 
I'd like to preface what I'm about to tell you by saying that I don't wish to be second-guessing... 
I don't have time for prefaces. 
Karen Hayes was called in to replace Bill Buchanan. 
She was hand-chosen by the vice president to take that post. 
I understand that, sir. 
Are you saying you feel she's unfit to do the job? 
Four hours ago, she relieved Bill Buchanan for ineffectual leadership. 
He's been working covertly with Chloe O'Brian to aid Jack Bauer, a federal fugitive. 
Which means Buchanan needs to be dealt with appropriately. 
What has Karen done? 
She sent in a tac team to pick them both up, but by the time they got there, O'Brian was gone. 
But instead of having the team do the interrogation of Buchanan onsite, Karen wasted 20 minutes by bringing him in to CTU. 
Maybe she felt the interrogation would be more effective with CTU resources. 
But, sir, she isn't even using rudimentary CTU resources. 
She wants to do a soft Q and A by herself. 
Any leads we may have had on O'Brian have dried up. 
Wait a second, Miles. 
I'm not going to pass judgment on Karen Hayes at this point. 
She's not interrogating a terrorist. 
She's dealing with a high ranking federal employee. 
Sometimes finesse and diplomacy are better than coercion. 
Your concern is duly noted, Miles. 
If you'll excuse me, I need to see the president. 
Karen. 
Shut up, Bill. 
We're offline. Now we can talk. 
Look, you can continue this charade of me being under arrest if you want to, but Jack needs our help. 
And he's getting it, but make no mistake, I am still in charge of this facility, and until I see that evidence, I must remain skeptical. 
Have you talked to Chloe? 
Yes. 
What's Jack's status? 
He's searching the cabin for the evidence, but the pilot is going to land that plane. 
How much time does Jack have? 
15 minutes. 
To search over 50 passengers? 
That's impossible. 
STAFFER ( over intercom ): Ms. Hayes. 
Yes. 
The president and Mike Novick want an update on the hijacking of the diplomatic flight. 
Put them through. 
Go ahead, sir. 
Ms. Hayes, 
this is the president. 
Talk to me about 520. 
We know that Bauer's involved, but we don't know why. 
Isn't it obvious? 
Bauer is a fugitive and he's looking for safe passage out of the country. 
Well, that's certainly a possibility, sir. 
Listen to me. This 
man is desperate. 
He will say or do anything. 
He's not to be trusted. 
We need to take him down now, dead or alive. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. President. 
Look. You call the pilot 
and you tell him that I don't care if Bauer is making threats or not, that plane has to land immediately. 
And when it lands, I want my Secret Service detail to take him into custody, is that clear? 
Ms. Hayes? 
Yes, Mr. President. 
The president has had knowledge of everything that's happened today. 
He wants that plane down before Jack finds the evidence. 
We have to buy him more time. 
I don't have the authority to keep that plane from landing. 
Sir. 
It still doesn't make sense to me. 
What? 
Jack Bauer has been on the right side of everything that's happened today, up until now. 
Well, right now, he is hijacking a plane. 
This man is not stupid. 
He's appeared to do the right thing, but right now, he's backed into a corner, and he's desperate. 
Do you really believe that, sir? 
I absolutely do. 
Bauer's lied to us all day. 
MAN: Flight Operations. 
This is Chloe O'Brian again. 
Yes, Ms. O'Brian. 
The copilot, Don Faganson, didn't check in when he boarded Flight 520. 
Mr. Faganson didn't board. 
Why not? 
He was replaced at the last minute. 
By whom? 
Scott Evans, the new copilot. 
Here are your things, Go back to your seat. 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
Jack, it's the copilot, Scott Evans. 
How do you know? 
He used to fly for Hatton Air. 
It's a private charter company that worked exclusively for Omicron. 
Evans was assigned to Henderson's group. 
He flew him around for over a year. 
Okay, I need you to patch me through to the captain on a discreet channel so Evans can't hear me. 
Okay. 
Sit down! 
Now! 
Everybody stay in your seats and no one  will get hurt! 
CHLOE: Go ahead. 
Captain, this is Jack Bauer. 
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel. 
The person that I'm looking for, the man with the evidence that I need, is sitting next to you. 
He's your copilot, Scott Evans. 
That's ridiculous. 
Sir, my sources have informed me that Evans was a last-second replacement. 
Can you explain to me why you're not flying with your regular copilot, Don Faganson? 
Captain, Scott Evans has been connected to a known terrorist. 
You need to open the door. 
This conversation is over. 
Damn it. 
What did he want? 
He's desperate. 
Wants us to land. 
This is messed up. 
Yeah. 
Bad luck for you, huh? 
Why? 
Well, wasn't Don supposed to have your seat tonight? 
Yeah. 
What happened to him? 
I don't know. 
I got the call, so I'm here. 
Yeah. 
Oh, God. 
What's wrong? 
( groans ) Could you, uh... 
Could you take the stick for a second? 
You okay? 
Yeah. I just... 
got a cramp in my leg. 
Yeah. Those are a bitch. 
Yeah. 
( groans ) I'm the only one who can fly this plane. 
Now, you don't strike me as a man who's willing to die for Christopher Henderson. 
Give me the recording. 
( cocking gun ) Do it. 
Slowly. 
Get up. 
Get back in your seat. 
You're going to land this plane or I'm going to put a bullet in your head. 
( phone ringing ) Yeah, Jack. 
Advise CTU I have the recording. 
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes. 
Got it. 
NEWSCASTER: At this hour, there are still many unanswered questions surrounding David Palmer's death. 
During the emergency press conference, the president announced that the terrorist threat was over... 
( phone ringing ) Yes. 
MARTHA ( weakly ): Charles. 
If I'm going to live with this, then you're going to have to help me. 
Help you do what, Martha? 
Understand. 
I... 
I know you're a good man, and that deep down, you do what's best for this country. 
Of course I do. 
Then why... 
why didn't you come to me? 
I'd have been there for you. 
I could have talked you through it. 
For God's sake, Martha, for the last three years, you've been one click away from a nervous breakdown every single day, and I'm gonna come to you for advice? 
( phone rings ) I'm gonna have to take another call. 
No. Charles, no, no. 
We'll talk later. 
( sobbing ) ( cell phone ringing ) Yes. 
Bauer's got the evidence. 
He is in control of the plane. 
How do you know that? 
We just picked up a call from Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes. 
What do we do? 
You are going to have to shoot down that plane, Mr. President. 
What? 
It's the only option we've got. 
Otherwise, you go to prison for treason and murder. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, Air Traffic Control just received a VCI distress signal from your aircraft that effectively authorizes President Logan to shoot you down. 
Start taking us down. 
Do it now. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, the F-18 is within 15 miles. 
PILOT: My radar is locked onto the target. 
Lower the landing gear! 
We're going too fast! 
Touch it down! 
( screaming ) ( screeching ) We're ready to move Bierko. 
Thank you. 
I'll be right out. 
Vladimir Bierko,  you're being transferred to a primary holding facility in our district headquarters. 
Jack, the attorney general is on his way to his office right now. 
He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes. 
JACK: Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback. 
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature so we can establish a chain of evidence. 
You work alone. 
We got the evidence. 
President Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination. 
The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating. 
Yes, it would. 
If only there were a way that we could prevent such a trial from taking place. 
( phone rings ) MILES: Mr. President? 
You don't know me. 
My name is Miles Papazian, I work under Karen Hayes. 
What is this about? 
It's about a recording, sir, if leaked, could significantly compromise national security. 
Why are you telling me this? 
I feel compelled to intervene, and I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve. 
I do, Mr. Papazian, 
I do approve. 
Get out of here, Miles. 
I'm just doing my job, Chloe. 
Well, if your job is is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work. 
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready. 
The attorney general will be on the line in five minutes. 
Did you tell him that the recording implicates President Logan in Palmer's assassination? 
No. I feel he needs to hear it 
directly from the source. 
Fine. 
We're minutes away, Chloe, what's your status? 
Everything is set up. 
I've got a T-1 line hooked in to the attorney general, the other two lines are secured on dedicated channels. 
What other two lines? 
We're patching in a representative from the House Judiciary Committee and a Congressional liaison. 
We need their support to call for an emergency session of Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. 
Impeachment proceedings? 
What about an arrest warrant? 
We'll never get Justice to indict a sitting president. 
Removing him from office is a necessary step to begin full criminal prosecution. 
All right, Chloe, let's check the sound levels. 
Play the recording. 
( recording playing white noise ) What's wrong? 
I don't know. 
What do you mean you don't know? 
Where's the recording? 
This is what's on the digital medium. 
That's impossible. 
See if there's an overlay, check your connections. 
There are no mistakes. 
Damn it, Chloe, you were responsible for this recording. 
What the hell happened? 
I just told you, I don't know. 
But if there was something on this memory chip, it's been erased. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
STAFFER: Excuse me, Ms. Hayes. 
The attorney general's holding on the line. 
Ms. Hayes? 
I heard you. 
Bill Buchanan will take the call in a moment. 
I'll tell him we're having technical difficulties, we need to postpone the conference. 
Someone got to that recording. 
Perhaps it was damaged in your attempts to retrieve it. 
It wasn't. 
Chloe, who had access to this room? 
No one. 
Someone did! 
Who had access to this room think about it! 
Miles was in here. 
What? 
You sent him in here to check up on me while I was setting up. 
HAYES: I never sent him in here! 
Jack... 
HAYES: Security, stop Mr. Bauer. 
Mr. Bauer! 
Jack, don't! 
You son of a bitch. 
Let go of me, Bauer. 
Do you know how many people lost their lives so I could bring that evidence in? 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
We know it was you. 
Let him go, Jack. 
Jack, let him go! 
Where are you going, Miles? 
I've been transferred. 
I was told to report immediately. 
The order should be coming through any minute. 
Transferred to where? 
The White House. 
How could you do this, Miles? 
This is not over. 
There will be an investigation. 
Do what you have to do, Karen... 
...but I work for 
the president now. 
Jack, I'm so sorry. 
I don't know how he did it, he didn't even touch the recorder. 
Karen, Audrey Raines heard the recording when I played it for Secretary Heller. 
I know that she will sign an affidavit... 
Jack, not now. 
Chloe, take the recorder down to Processing. 
Break down the memory chip and see if you can restore anything. 
Fine. 
Ms. Hayes? 
The president's calling for you. 
Line two. 
Mr. President. 
LOGAN ( over phone ): Karen, what's this I hear about a conference call you've scheduled with the attorney general? 
Is there some problem I should know about? 
HAYES ( over phone ): It's nothing, sir, a mistake. 
The conference call was canceled. 
Good, I'm glad to hear that. 
Listen, the real reason for my call is Jack Bauer. 
What about Jack Bauer? 
I'm embarrassed to say that after further review, it appears that the evidence against him is, at best, inconclusive. 
Now, we'll have our lawyers continue to work on it, of course, but for the time being, I'm suspending the arrest order. 
You're dropping the charges against Bauer? 
That's correct. 
Mr. President, you have had 
this office, other agencies, and the military dedicate all manpower and resources into apprehending Jack Bauer. 
Yes. Based on evidence I 
initially thought was credible. 
And now I have new information that's convinced me that the original intel was faulty. 
Am I to release Bauer, sir? 
I'll leave that to your discretion. 
Thank you, Karen. 
Good work. 
We'll be in touch. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
He's letting me go because he knows he's won. 
What does he gain by releasing you? 
I'll be on my own. 
Alone, unprotected, a perfect target. 
Word just came in Bierko's escaped. 
What?! 
How long ago?! 
The convoy that was moving him to District was hit about ten minutes ago. 
They took out all our agents except one: Davis, on line three. 
( phone beeps ) Davis, Karen Hayes. 
What happened? 
Our lead car got taken out by an IED. 
I counted six attackers. 
Bierko got away before I could call in backup. 
Did you see the vehicle? 
Negative. 
I blacked out when I took one in the shoulder. 
There's a medevac team on the way. 
DAVIS ( over speakerphone ): Before I lost consciousness, I overheard Bierko talking to his men. 
He said they're not finished. 
"Not finished"? 
Yes, ma'am, I'm certain he said something about a nerve gas canister. 
Did he say anything else? 
I'm sorry, Ms. Hayes, 
that's all I heard. 
All right, Davis, stand by. 
The medical team will be there in a minute. 
Copy that. 
Why would Bierko even mention the Sentox? 
I don't know. 
I assumed all the canisters were destroyed in the explosions at the distribution center. 
How many canisters has forensics accounted for? 
By the time the fires were put out, there was not enough left to do a full accounting. 
Damn it. 
Bill, raise an inter-agency alert. 
I need LAPD to do a sweep of the ambush area for witnesses. 
I want search helicopters. 
I want Chloe to have full domain over surveillance satellites. 
This is priority one we have got to find Vladimir Bierko. 
( metal door rattling ) We held one in reserve, just as you ordered... 
but I still don't understand why. 
We can't do much damage with one canister of nerve gas. 
You're so wrong. 
E-Excuse me? 
Agent... 
It's Agent Cole, ma'am. 
Cole. 
I'm sorry, Agent Cole. 
My husband said that Aaron Pierce had been transferred to Washington, and this is Agent Pierce's phone. 
I was wondering if you'll be so good as to make sure that it's returned to him? 
Of course. 
Was there anything else, ma'am? 
No. 
There's nothing else. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm sorry about this, Aaron. 
Listen to me, Aaron. 
You think you know what's going on. 
( sighs ) I'm here to tell you, you don't. 
Then why don't you explain it to me, Mr. President? 
I understand Jack Bauer led you to believe that there was a recording something that tied me to David Palmer's murder. 
That recording doesn't exist. 
That's not what I've been told. 
You're not hearing what I'm saying. 
The recording doesn't exist. 
It's over. 
You have a choice here, Aaron. 
You are a good man. 
You're a fine agent. 
I see no reason to throw away your career. 
But I need to know that we can put this behind us. 
If you'll give me your word that you'll let this drop, I will make sure that you are reassigned to whatever post you want. 
Except for the White House, of course. 
So... 
what's it gonna be, Aaron? 
Are my terms acceptable? 
There is nothing that you have said or done that is acceptable to me in the least. 
You're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office. 
And it's my duty to see that you're brought to justice for what you've done. 
Is there anything else, Charles? 
I know Pierce, Mr. President. 
Served with him for five years. 
And his loyalty is to David Palmer. 
Believe me when I tell you, he's going to be a problem. 
( dialing ) ( cell phone ringing ) Mr. President. 
I confess, I didn't expect to hear from you again. 
The situation's changed. 
Everything's under control. 
The recording's been destroyed; it's no longer a problem. 
That's very good news, Mr. President. 
But what about the people who've already heard it? 
Can't do anything without proof. 
I don't think any further action needs to be taken. 
Then can we assume you've got the rest of your house in order? 
If by that you mean my wife, yes. 
Yes, she's cooperating fully. 
As for Aaron Pierce, that's another matter, but, um... 
I'm taking care of that. 
Of course. 
What about Jack Bauer? 
I've already given Karen Hayes permission to release him, and the arrangements that we discussed about taking him out have already been set in motion. 
It appears you have everything well in hand, Mr. President. 
Yes, yes. 
I said I would handle it, and I have. 
Situation's contained, there's nothing more to worry about. 
I'll call you back. 
Mike? 
Sir. 
What is it, Mike? 
I just got off the phone with Karen Hayes. 
Vladimir Bierko has escaped. 
What? How? 
The caravan transporting him to District was ambushed. 
Damn it! 
I thought we rolled CTU into Homeland Security just to avoid screwups like this. 
There's more, sir. 
They have reason to believe Bierko might be readying another terrorist attack. 
What kind of attack? 
Well, CTU's working on that now. 
I want constant updates. 
You keep me apprised of the progress. 
Yes, sir. 
Chloe, any luck? 
Only the bad kind. 
None of these satellites were positioned toward the ambush site. 
By the time I queued a redirect, Bierko and his men were long gone. 
You try CalTrans? 
I'm back-streaming now. 
So far, I've come up dry. 
Keep trying. 
We've got to get an ID on the vehicle. 
I know. 
That was LAPD command. 
They've combed the area, but they can't find any witnesses. 
None? 
4:00 a.m. in 
the middle of a curfew; there simply wasn't anyone there. 
Then we have nothing. 
We've got Henderson. 
What about him? 
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with. 
No, we've already been down that road. 
He won't talk to us, and you know that. 
That was about protecting Logan. 
If Henderson's the patriot he says he is, he's not gonna want those terrorists to succeed. 
Trust me, you're wasting your time. 
He's not gonna help us. 
He will if we offer him a deal. 
That's not gonna happen. 
Jack. 
No. 
Not this time. 
Not this man. 
We're running out of options here. 
This is about saving lives, not indulging a grudge. 
You think this is about a grudge? 
He killed an ex-President of the United States. 
He tried to kill the Secretary of Defense. 
You want this man to walk with full immunity? 
It's not about what anyone wants, it's about doing what has to be done. 
Nobody knows that better than you. 
Bierko is going to kill innocent people. 
Henderson might be our only chance to stop him. 
Jack... 
what would David Palmer want you to do if he were here? 
The best way to honor his memory is to make the choice to save others. 
Obviously, I can't stop you from doing this. 
If you're gonna give him a deal, at least let me present it. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
Since you're clearly no longer a fugitive, I assume they retrieved that recording. 
Someone got to it and erased it. 
I'm not here to talk about the recording. 
Bierko escaped about a half an hour ago. 
He's gonna carry out another attack. 
I'm sure he will. 
You bruised the man's ego when you stopped his first attempt. 
You know him. 
You know how he thinks. 
You studied him before you set up this deal. 
What's he gonna do? 
Why should I help you? 
You call yourself a patriot. 
Prove it. 
These terrorists are gonna attack the country that you love, because you betrayed them. 
Why don't you help me put out the fire that you started? 
They sent you in here to broker a deal, didn't they? 
What's the offer, full immunity? 
That just must be really eating you up inside. 
What do you think? 
You were responsible for the murder of people that I cared about. 
I am sorry about David Palmer, I am. 
But what I did was in the interest of the destiny of this country. 
And I'm not talking about the version you read on the op-ed pages pages ofthe New York Times. 
I'm talking about the politics of survival the way the world really works. 
Do you want immunity or not? 
Immunity is worthless. 
Yeah. 
( beeping ) Jack. 
That recording was my only immunity. 
They give me a piece of paper, I walk out of here, I'm a dead man. 
It's two days, two hours, two months, who cares? 
They're gonna take me down. 
Who's they? 
Same people that made Walt Cummings look like a suicide. 
Come on, Jack. 
You can't really believe that Charles Logan masterminded all of this by himself. 
Give me the names. 
You can't touch them. 
But they can touch you. 
I'll help you catch Bierko. 
But not for an immunity deal. 
I need something more, and you're the only person can make it happen. 
What do you want? 
To disappear, just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese. 
Except, I'm not gonna make your mistake. 
I'm gonna leave the country, I'm gonna take Miriam with me. 
You don't need my help for that. 
Actually, I do. 
All of my contacts are still loyal to the President. 
I need somebody I can trust to cover our tracks. 
I need somebody who can do a better job of it than those incompetents who failed to cover yours. 
What makes you think that I'm not gonna kill you the second this is over? 
Because you're gonna give me your word. 
And I know what your word is worth to you. 
So it's all I need. 
Anything less than Bierko's head on a plate, this deal is off. 
Fine. 
Now, Bierko is gonna hit hard, so you gonna think fast Chloe, do a phone check on these 14 names. 
I want you working out of the Situation Room. 
What do we have? 
Henderson gave us 14 names that he believes Bierko's gonna contact first. 
Chloe's doing a phone check and pulling up relative data. 
Is Tactical standing by? 
They're on priority alert. 
I put Curtis Manning in command, if it's all right with you. 
I trust your judgment, Bill. 
Security's getting ready to bring Henderson in here for a debrief. 
Excuse me for one second. 
Audrey. 
Jack, I just heard about the recording. 
Has it really been destroyed? 
President Logan managed to get to it. 
My God. 
We have a more immediate problem. 
Bierko. I heard that he escaped. 
That's why I came back out here. 
I was hoping that I could help. 
Why is Henderson coming out of Holding? 
We're using him to help us find Bierko. 
Audrey, Karen made a deal. 
She gave him immunity. 
What?! Jack, 
how can you let this happen? 
You know what that man has done. 
We didn't have a choice. 
Bierko's our number one priority. 
We know he's planning another attack. 
Without Henderson's help, we won't find him. 
BUCHANAN: Jack! 
I think we've got something. 
Audrey, I'm sorry. 
I've got to go. 
CHLOE: Out of the 14 names on the list, only one has an active cell phone-- Joseph Malina. 
Joseph Malina's an arms dealer. 
Used to be a military contractor until they accused him of selling secrets. 
But they couldn't prove anything, so he beat all the charges. 
You know him? 
Well enough. I did business 
with him before and after he was arrested. 
HAYES: What do you have on him? 
Malina got a 12 second call on his home phone at 4:03 a.m. 
from a pay phone in Van Nuys not far from the ambush site. 
A minute later, the same pay phone got a call-back from a GSM Sat phone. 
In other words, he took down the number, called from an untraceable line. 
Sounds like our guy. 
Tell Curtis to mobilize his tactical team. 
Hang on, hang on. 
What good is that going to accomplish? 
You're going to bring Malina in here. 
You think he's just going to roll over on Bierko? 
He didn't cut a deal when he was busted before, he's not gonna cut a deal now. 
And even if you can crack him I don't think you can you're going to need hours, and you don't have hours. 
What do you suggest? 
I suggest you send me in to talk to Malina. 
I'll find out what Bierko got from him. 
I don't think so. 
Jack, don't be stupid. 
You know you can't get anything out of this guy, and his computer makes this place look like an Internet cafe. 
He's got the absolute, most sophisticated, state-of-the-art security system, including a Phoenix Shield. 
We can get through it. 
Not a Phoenix. 
It's a poison pill firewall. 
Any attempt at circumventing it, and the hard drive does a cold-start erase, at which point, you can forget about retrieving any data. 
Take him back to Holding. 
I don't think we have a choice here. 
Karen, please, don't do this. 
Jack, I know how you feel, but Henderson's right. 
We can't afford to gamble on this play. 
Damn it, Bill, you cannot trust this guy. 
HAYES: I agree. 
That's why I'm sending you with him. 
I want him under your guard on a tight leash. 
If he tries anything, I swear to you, I will kill him. 
Then don't let it get to that point. 
* * * * Get in. 
Adams, listen to me. 
You don't have to do this. 
Logan isn't worth protecting. 
You know that. 
He's not going to get away with any of this, and neither will you. 
Shut up and get in the trunk. 
Use your head. 
Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much, that I'm a liability. 
How soon before you're just another liability? 
( both grunting ) ( grunts ) MARTHA: What are you doing? 
Ma'am please stay where you are. 
Aaron? 
You're going to shoot me? 
I'm the First Lady. 
You're going to shoot the First Lady? 
Who are you calling? 
Mrs. Logan, 
this is my last warning. 
( grunts ) ( silenced gunshot ) ( shallow breathing ) ( whimpering ) ( crying ) Martha. 
Aaron! 
( crying ) Aaron, stay with me. 
Aaron! Oh, God. 
Oh, God, Aaron. 
CURTIS: Jack, we're coming up on Malina's place. 
( tires squealing ) ( engine revving ) Curtis, I want you to set up a perimeter. 
I want a man at each possible escape route. 
You got it. 
As for you, you got ten minutes. 
You don't get the intelligence from Malina by then, we come through the door, and we interrogate him. 
I'm gonna tell you again, Jack, interrogating won't work. 
This guy won't break. 
Then you better hope your way does. 
Get me an audio pack. 
Undo your shirt. 
Wait a minute. 
You can't wire me. 
Why not? 
Well, think about it, Jack. 
You heard Malina's file. 
This guy didn't get where he got by being careless. 
He's got a scanner, frequency detector, God knows what else. 
The second I walk through that door with a wire, the bells go off, this thing's over. 
Look, you don't trust me, fine. 
And just so we're straight, I don't trust you, either, but neither one of us can afford to blow this operation. 
We're all set. Men 
are in position. 
No games, Christopher. 
I don't need another reason to put a bullet in your brain. 
You got ten minutes. 
Have CTU in-monitor channel 8. 
Hold up. 
Go. 
( beep ) ( beep ) Who is it? 
What do you want, Chris? 
We have to talk. 
What, at 4:30 in the morning? 
About Vladimir Bierko. 
You don't waste my time, I don't waste your time. 
You're going to want to hear what I have to say. 
( buzzer sounds ) ( door creaks open ) ( panting ) ( buzzer beeping ) ( whirring ) ( whirring ) ( beep ) ( beep ) Hey! 
What's so important it couldn't wait? 
What are you looking for? 
Is there another way out of here? 
What the hell are you talking about? 
Jack, I don't like this. 
What's Henderson doing? 
I don't yet. 
Maintain your position. 
I repeat, maintain your position. 
Secure-cache the files. 
Anything you can't do without. 
Why? 
Because there is an entire phalanx of CTU agents outside, including an ex-agent named Jack Bauer. 
He's selling us out, Jack. 
HENDERSON: Now, Bauer is running me. 
I cut a deal with him, but I know this guy's gonna kill me first chance he gets. 
JACK: Curtis, move your team in now. 
All teams, move in now! 
You bastard, you brought him here! 
He was coming here anyway. 
So secure the files, crash the system. 
Stop wasting time, and do it! 
( panting ) ( whirring ) ( blow torch hissing ) ( panting ) Give me a weapon. 
( glass shattering in distance ) Freeze! ( yells ) 
( groans ) ( grunts ) ( Curtis groans ) Christopher! 
Let me see your hands! Now! 
Slowly stand up. 
Put the weapon on the counter. 
Step back. 
Curtis, how are your men? 
CURTIS: My men are fine. 
I've been hit, but I'm okay. 
Call in medical; get him transferred back to CTU. 
What's Malina's condition? 
Gunshot to the hip. 
He's losing blood. 
Stabilize him, keep him alive. 
I had him, Jack. 
30 more seconds was all I needed. 
You played me. 
This is over; you're going back. 
No, you blew it, Jack. 
What are you talking about? 
I got him to life the firewall, and he was about to dump all of his files onto a flash drive before you jumped the gun and busted in here. 
Now you're going to waste a hell of a lot of time trying to decrypt those files off a mainframe, so you'd better pray there's something on there you can read. 
Cuff him. 
Bill, this is Jack. 
Get Chloe to open up a channel. 
I'm going to send you some files from Malina's computer. 
I'm on it, Jack. 
Chloe, I need you to access these files, find out which ones were opened in the last ten minutes. 
They'll tell us what Malina sold Bierko. 
They're coming through now hang on. 
Bill, Curtis was hit he's stable, but I'm having him transported back to CTU. 
All right, Jack, I'll tell Medical. 
Send a chopper over to this location. 
As soon as we know what Bierko's target is, we're going to need to move fast. 
Okay, I got through the firewall. 
It's still going to take me some time to decrypt the files. 
Chloe, just do it as quickly as you can. 
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon. 
We need to know where. 
There, you should have everything. 
Let's go. 
Aaron? 
Charles lied to me. 
He said you'd been transferred to Washington. 
That agent, um... 
Adams, my husband ordered him to kill you, didn't he? 
Yes, ma'am. 
But I'm sorry to tell you... 
the president was involved with much worse things than that. 
I know. 
I was going to let him get away with it... all of it. 
I was going to keep quiet. 
We have to do something. 
I'll hide the body, get him in the trunk, but I can't drive it out of here. 
The president has to believe that I'm dead. 
I need to lay low, keep out of sight. 
I can do it. 
No. No. 
Yes, Aaron, I can drive it. 
No, you need to get back inside the residence. 
Your husband can't suspect that anything has gone wrong. 
You need to find Mike Novick. 
Mike? 
Tell him everything. 
And tell him to meet me here. 
Okay. 
Aaron, promise me... 
promise me that if something goes wrong and you're in danger of getting caught, you will find a way off these grounds, and you will leave. 
Promise me. 
You have my word. 
Secure him by the tailgate. 
( dialing ) ( phone ringing ) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
How is Chloe doing with the files? 
Almost there, Jack. 
Okay, I got it. 
Wait, there's something more. 
Classified defense contracts and plans. 
It's a Russian submarine, Jack. 
The Natalia-K524, Delta-IV class. 
It's here for inspection by our navy. 
Why is the U.S. Navy inspecting 
a Russian submarine? 
It's part of the treaty that President Logan and President Suvarov signed. 
There's a provision that calls for the sharing of technology. 
Where is it docked? 
Docking Station 8. 
It's a non-military shipyard at the Port of Los Angeles. 
I'll deploy TAC teams to the port. 
Good. 
Chloe, hold on. 
What's the armament package on a Russian Delta IV-class sub? 
Best of my knowledge, 12 Scorpion land attack missiles. 
Are they nuclear? 
No, but they're fast and accurate. 
ey carry multiple warheads. 
One could take out several city blocks. 
( helicopter propeller whirring ) Uncuff him. 
Karen, it's Jack. 
Are you still there? 
Yes, Jack, I'm here. 
Okay, I need you to put me in touch with the ranking U.S. officer 
on the Natalia. 
We need to get them to lock out their onboard weapons systems! 
All right, I'll have Audrey call DOD and open a priority line to the sub, and she'll get back to you. 
Okay, thank you. 
You're coming with me. 
I found Bierko's target for you. 
The deal was Bierko's head on a plate. 
What do you want me to do now-- kill him for you?! 
The only reason you're going with me is 'cause you know the weapons systems. 
Go! 
( phone ringing ) This is Bauer. 
Jack, I've got the U.S. Navy's 
ranking officer on board the Natalia I'm putting you through. 
Okay, Audrey, stay on the line. 
All right, Jack, hold on. 
AUDREY: Lieutenant Southern, you're on with Jack Bauer. 
Agent Bauer, what is this about? 
JACK: Lieutenant, we believe the Natalia has been targeted for a terrorist attack. 
You need to secure your vessel and lock down your weapons systems immediately. 
Ski! 
Call all hands, set Condition Delta, seal the bridge and aft hatches. 
Aye, sir. 
You need to put your men on alert. 
There's a threat to your submarine. 
( speaking Russian ) Now, what is the nature of this threat? 
We think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub. 
I'm going to check right now. 
Sailor! I've got that. 
Report aft. 
Bauer. 
I'm checking topside. 
Lieutenant! 
Damn it, Audrey, I've lost him. 
Notify DOD. 
All right, Jack, I'm on it. 
Captain, how far out are we? 
Just over five minutes, sir. 
( device beeps ) ( typing ) Read me the code we got from Malina. 
PETROV: "Alpha 255 Tango Romeo 99." 
( beeps ) We have control of the weapons system. 
Are the missiles loaded? 
Vertical tubes are loaded and ready. 
Loading horizontal tubes now. 
Coordinates for the targets  upload them into the missiles. 
Begin the launch countdown. 
How much time do you need to cancel the launch sequence? 
I won't know for certain till I see how the targeting software is configured. 
We're going to keep Bierko and his men out of here, so you can finish this. 
CHLOE:  Ten seconds to launch. 
It's done. 
( over radio ): The launch sequence is canceled. 
You were never really going to let me go, were you? 
 JACK:  No. 
You were responsible for the deaths of David Palmer and Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler. 
I'm going after Logan. 
What do you mean, "going after Logan"? 
 I'll fill you in  on the details later. 
Right now, I need you to walk me through modifying some field communications equipment. 
Who is this guy? 
Morris O'Brian, Chloe's ex-husband. 
I need some com unit modifications. 
Can you do that without talking? 
I could, but it would be a terrible waste of my charm. 
Jack Bauer's on his way here now. 
 He's going to confront  your husband directly. 
But Charles is leaving for the airfield immediately. 
You have to find a way to stall him. 
There's a helicopter waiting for me. 
Let it wait. 
I can't. 
Yes, you can. 
You're the president. 
Aaron said the recording you had implicating the president was destroyed. 
Yes. 
NOVICK:  Without it, you can't  mount a case. 
I'm working with someone inside CTU. 
They're setting up a digital uplink. 
If I can get Logan to acknowledge everything that he's done today, it's going to be all the evidence we need. 
 I need to get on that chopper. 
PIERCE:  I don't see how that's  gonna be possible. 
If Logan doesn't confess, how far are you actually willing to go? 
As far as I have to. 
Ah... 
Here, let me get this for you. 
Watch your hair. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
I got a flight suit. 
Go ahead. 
Did you make it to the Secret Service outbuilding? 
Yeah. 
I think Morris and I may have a way to pull the copilot from the flight. 
What about the reassignment protocol? 
Working on it. 
Mike Novick will have to verify the pilot codes. 
It should take him about one minute. 
Chloe, hold on a second. 
I'm switching over to com. 
Okay. 
Do you copy? 
Yeah. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I'm on the chopper. 
Mike Novick's going to call. 
Morris. 
Yes, sweetheart? 
I need you to do one more thing. 
Some guy from Central just called. 
Says your packet's messed up. 
I got that straightened out Monday. 
I guess not. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Now? 
Right now. He had 
me patch you through to the Secret Service outbuilding. 
Mike. 
I've delayed him as long as I can. 
He'll be there in a few minutes. 
Have you heard anything from Jack Bauer yet? 
He should be in the Secret Service outbuilding. I'm sending him 
the necessary documents now. 
There's not much time. 
I understand. 
PIERCE: Yeah, Mike. 
The reassignment protocol and authorization should be coming through to you. 
He'll need both. 
How are we doing for time? 
Hurry. 
Hello. 
Hello. 
John. 
Aaron. 
I thought you transferred out. 
Not quite yet. 
Some guy from Central called, said my packet's all messed... 
Don't worry about him. 
Carruth has been relieved. 
I guess there was something wrong with his packet. 
Ron Franklin. 
There's my protocol. 
This is not bad, but it needs to be more positive, like, uh... 
Jack Bauer is on the helicopter. 
You have to find an excuse not to get on board. 
LOGAN: Um... Carolyn, do you 
have the itinerary? 
MARTHA: Charles? 
Excuse me. Could 
I talk to you for a second? 
Absolutely. 
Will you excuse us for a second? 
I know it sounds silly, but I didn't bring my medication. 
and I just, I just want to have it with me. 
Of course. Of course. 
We'll send somebody back for it. 
No, no, no.  
I don't want to delay you. 
I'll be along later. 
Besides, Charles, I-I'm thinking that when you land, it would be better if I wasn't with you. 
Why? 
This is your moment, Charles. 
I-I think that... 
when you step out of that helicopter alone, after saving the country, that is an image that history will never forget. 
All right. 
Thank you, Marti. 
But don't be  far behind me, now. 
I won't. 
Thank you. 
Captain. 
 I can fly this thing if I have to,  which leaves you with one of two choices. 
You either do what I say and you live, or you don't and you die for nothing. 
You understand me? 
I want you to wait until I give you my command, then follow these instructions slowly. 
You're going to disconnect your helmet from the communications system. 
Then I want you to rip out the mic cable, take your helmet off and stow it. 
Do it now. 
I'll know if you deviate from your flight plan. 
Mr. President! 
I have a message for you from the White House! 
LOGAN: What the hell are you doing?! 
Put these on! 
You. 
This is Jack. 
Do you copy? 
I'm here, Jack. 
Where are you? 
We just left the ranch. 
I have Logan with me. 
Is Morris standing by with the equipment? 
He's on his way. I'll 
let him know you're airborne. 
Make sure the pilot takes heading 2-8-6 for two miles, then breaks south. 
Captain! 
I want you to follow heading 2-8-6 for two miles, then break south. 
Once you break south, there should be an industrial park. 
There's an abandoned printing press facility that you can use. 
I'll get back to you. 
Copy that. 
What are you trying to do, Jack? 
Whatever it is, you know you won't get away with it. 
Are you going to kill me? 
I suppose you want some sort of revenge. 
I understand that. 
Bad things happened. 
I didn't want them to happen. 
People who worked for me they-they went too far. 
They did things that they thought I wanted them to do, but they were wrong. 
You have to understand. 
I have always acted in the country's best interest. 
But you're just trying to get even. 
Do you realize what effect this will have on the American people? 
This day has been trying enough, and now the President is being attacked. 
If you want to do what's right, you will turn this thing around and go back. 
Damn it, Bauer, say something! 
Hello. 
Morris. 
Yes, love. 
The helicopter is landing in an industrial park one mile due east of where you are. 
Head over there. 
Okay, now, I give this guy what we worked on, and then I'm out, right? 
Yes, but make sure you have him call me when you do the hand-off. 
All right. 
Thanks. 
Shut it down! 
Your safety belt. 
Move towards the door slowly. 
Come on. Move! 
Come on. 
Move inside. Go. 
Jack, maybe we can work something out. 
There's still time. 
What do you want? 
I can help you get away from here with enough money to start a new life, maybe find that daughter of yours. 
Try to work something out. 
Whatever you want, it's yours. 
You have my word. 
Your word. 
Jack, I'm the President of the United States. 
I'm not, I'm not carrying any weapons. 
Don't you make a sound. 
Hey. 
Give me the case. 
Jack Bauer. 
I should have known that. 
Modified equipment. 
Yeah. 
Oh, that's President Logan, Jack. 
Get out of here. 
Yeah. 
Chloe wants you to call her. 
Go. 
Yeah, Jack? 
I have him. 
All right. 
I've just checked the response deployment. 
You have less than ten minutes until they're on you. 
Fine. 
Listen, Jack. 
I don't mean to put any added pressure on you, but if you don't have a confession by then, we'll all be arrested for treason. 
Is this some kind of broadcast? 
What is this? 
I would like to know. 
Is this an assassination? 
A confession. 
Don't count on it. 
I know you're good at extracting information. 
I know that you're good at torture. 
I saw what you did with Walt Cummings. 
I think you'll be surprised to find out that I'm a little tougher than that. 
Take a seat. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Can you hear me? 
Yeah, Jack. 
I want to make sure that you have good reception. 
Who you talking to? 
Are those your friends at CTU? 
You know you're putting them in danger, as well. 
Coming through fine, Jack. 
Okay, good. 
My people can't be far behind, Jack. 
There's still time to get away. 
Take it. 
The plan involving the Sentox nerve gas, it was designed to fool the terrorists and the Russians. 
Whether or not you formulated the plan is irrelevant. 
You authorized it. 
You're delusional. 
David Palmer uncovered evidence of this plan. 
When he started asking questions, he was assassinated. 
Other people were killed to cover that murder up. 
Men and women who served this country with distinction; people that I worked with; friends of mine. 
No, you're wrong. 
This is all a pack of lies. 
The terrorists discovered your deception. 
And they deployed Sentox nerve gas on American soil. 
Every American who died today as a result of terrorist activity is another murder that you're accountable for. 
And before you leave here, you're going to admit it. 
I suppose if you hurt me enough, Jack, I'll say whatever you want, but that won't make it  the truth. 
And everybody who watches this will know that perfectly well. 
What are the names of your co-conspirators? 
There are no co-conspirators, because there is no... 
Walt Cummings, Christopher Henderson, James Nathanson have all admitted to being part of this conspiracy! 
Now they are dead! 
Right before Christopher Henderson died he acknowledged that there were others! 
What are their names?! 
A man will say anything under torture. 
This won't mean a thing. 
Mr. Logan, I'm not going 
to torture you, but you are going to tell me what I want to know. 
Or so help me God, I will kill you. 
A year and a half ago, I was warned that my life was in danger by someone within the government. 
I was told the only  way I could stay alive was to create the illusion that I was dead. 
I was forced to deceive people that I loved. 
My only daughter will never forgive me. 
As I see the depth of your corruption unfold, I have no doubt that you are that source of danger. 
David Palmer was a great man. 
And he was a great president. 
He was also my friend. 
He tried to warn me about you and now he is dead. 
Other people tried to help me and they are dead, too. 
So, Mr. Logan, I hope 
you understand I have absolutely nothing to lose. 
You are going to be held accountable for your part of everything that happened today. 
You are not going to be able to hide behind the presidency. 
Right here, right now, you are going to face justice! 
And make no mistake about this, this is personal. 
And if you think for a second that I am scared to put a bullet in your brain, you don't know me. 
I'm going to ask you one last time, who are your co-conspirators? 
You have until the count of three, or I will kill you. 
One... 
You make me a martyr, I'll go down in history with Lincoln and Kennedy, but you'll go down with John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald. 
Is that what you want? 
Two! 
You're a man of honor. 
How can you assassinate a president of the United States in front of the entire world? 
If you love your country, you won't pull the trigger. 
Three! 
You can't do it, can you? 
No, Jack, it's all right. 
Jack, it's all right. 
It's all right. 
It's all right that you can't. 
I'm the president. 
Jack, they're here. 
AGENT: Lay flat on your stomach! 
Put your hands out in front of you! 
Extend your arms! 
Mr. President, 
are you all right? 
I'm fine. 
I actually feel sorry for that man. 
He's delusional. 
It would be better if he were put in some sort of solitary confinement for the time being. 
Jack Bauer wasn't able to get the President to confess, Mrs. Logan. 
I'm sorry. 
Why not? 
What happened? 
I'm not sure of the details. 
Bauer's in custody. 
Gentlemen. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. 
That will be all. 
Thank you so much. 
If I could just get you to come this way. Thank you. 
Thank you so much. 
David... 
Marti, don't do this to me now. 
You killed him. 
You killed him. 
You're a murderer. 
Stop. 
You are! 
You're a criminal! 
My wife is not well. 
Would you please escort her? 
Get off me! 
Don't you touch me! 
Don't you touch me! 
Escort her into the hangar, please. 
You don't know what he did! 
He's not fit to be president! 
It is a sacrilege for him to be even speaking David's name! 
Don't...! 
No! 
I want to make sure that she's all right. 
Has the hangar been cleared? 
Yes, sir. 
All secure. 
It's empty. 
Good. 
Let them know that I'll be back in a moment. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
You're not wearing some kind of listening device, are you? 
What are you talking about? 
I have to watch you now, Marti. 
You said that I was a good liar, but I am nothing compared to you. 
Charles...! Stop it! 
Stop it! 
Charles... 
Aah! 
Yeah, Marti. 
Tell me the truth. 
You're hurting me. 
You don't know what pain is. 
I'm on to you, Marti. 
I should've seen it from the first, but I wanted to believe that you still cared for me. 
Making love to me was just a ploy, wasn't it? 
Took a lot of planning to get Jack Bauer on that helicopter. 
You were part of that plan, weren't you? 
It was your job to delay me, wasn't it? 
Wasn't it?! 
Please... 
Wasn't it?! 
They used you so Jack Bauer could get to me. 
Come on, Marti. 
Come on, Marti. 
Admit it, you were part of it. 
Yes. Yes. 
Why? 
Why...? 
Why did you help them? 
Because you killed David Palmer. 
I told you I didn't realize that was going to happen. 
Your people killed him to protect you. 
You covered it up, that's just as bad. 
I covered it up because I had to. 
Oh, and then others died to cover that up. 
That's right, for the good of the country. 
You sold nerve gas to terrorists. 
You're insane. 
You're insane! 
I did it for the good of the country as I saw it at the time. 
You're such a hypocrite. 
After your little performance this morning, you're in no position to call me a hypocrite. 
And I will tell you something else if you blow up like this one more time... 
I will fill you so full of drugs, you won't even remember your own name. 
And then I will ship you off to an asylum and you can stay there for the rest of your life. 
Are we clear? 
Are we clear? 
My fellow Americans, this has been a terrible day in the history of this country and yet at the same time, a triumphant day, because in the end, we won a significant victory over the forces of chaos and terror. 
We have preserved and protected our way of life, despite the loss of innocent American lives. 
I'll start the transmission in one minute. 
Is the Attorney General there? 
I'm here, Ms. O'Brian. 
I certainly hope this recording is as important as you claim it is. 
Chloe, what's this about? 
I set up a conference call with the Attorney General. 
He's on speakerphone now. 
Are you serious? 
I'm very serious. 
Mr. Attorney General, 
this is Karen Hayes, Homeland Security. 
Bill Buchanan, CTU. 
Sir, I apologize. Ms. O'Brian 
placed this call without authorization from me. 
I'm sorry I had to do that. 
We had to do things under the radar to protect you all in case things went wrong. 
In case what things went wrong? 
I think it would help if I just played the recording. 
HAYES: What recording? 
It's a conversation that took place five minutes ago between the President and his wife. 
How could you possibly have a recording of something like that? 
Sir, an agent named Jack Bauer placed a listening device on the President shortly before this conversation. 
Bauer? Isn't he the one 
that's under arrest? 
CHLOE: I'm going to play the recording now. 
I don't want to listen to it. 
Ms. O'Brian, at the very least, 
this constitutes an egregious violation of privacy, and we're talking about the President. 
MARTHA ( sobbing ): ...'cause you killed 
David Palmer. 
LOGAN: I told you, I didn't realize that was going to happen. 
Your people killed him to protect you. 
You covered it up, that's just as bad. 
I covered it up because I had to. 
Oh, and then others died to cover that up! 
That's right, for the good of the country. 
You sold nerve gas to terrorists. 
You're insane. 
You're insane! 
A poet once said, "No man is an island." 
On a day like this, we can feel the truth of those words. 
Any untimely death is a tragedy. 
Yet some men embody such greatness of character that their death serves as a unifying force for those who remain behind. 
David Palmer was such a man. 
A great President, a great American and on a more personal note a wonderful friend. 
He'll be missed... 
( cell phone rings ) ...more than words 
can express... 
Holtzman. 
Yes, sir. 
We take this moment to remember with appreciation... 
With all due respect, Mr. Attorney General, 
are you sure this isn't some kind of mistake? 
Yes, sir. 
I understand, sir. 
I'll do exactly as you say. 
LOGAN: ...combination of wisdom, 
strength and moral courage, this country might have not survived in its present form. 
It's very appropriate that David Palmer will be laid to rest in Arlington Cemetery, for he was a soldier in the truest sense. 
He was a man whose courage rose in direct proportion to the threats his country faced. 
In closing, I would ask that the country observe a national day of mourning for one of the greatest Americans this nation will ever see. 
Thank you very much. 
Federal marshall. 
Would you please come with us? 
What the hell do you think you're doing? 
You came very close to disrupting my speech. 
BROWN: On behalf of President Logan, I wish to thank you all very much for joining us. 
I am sorry, but out of respect for today's... 
Those are ridiculous accusations. 
Excuse me. 
If I may, sir? 
You've probably never seen one of these, Mr. President. 
It's a micro-transmitter. 
Agent Clark, arrest these men and get them the hell out of here. 
I'm sorry.  
Mr. President. 
We have our orders. 
You take...! 
You take your orders from me. 
Not anymore. 
After you, sir. 
OFFICER: Attention! 
Aim, fire! 
OFFICER: Attention! 
Aim, fire! 
Attention! 
Aim, fire! 
Present arms. 
Sir. 
Give me a second. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Thank God you're safe. 
Everything's going to be all right. 
Jack, when I heard you kidnapped the President... 
I was just trying to get him to give me a direct confession. 
Jack... 
How much longer do you need to stay here? 
Not much longer. They can 
debrief me tomorrow. 
You sure? 
I can't believe you're really, you're really here. 
Agent Bauer, excuse me, but there's  a call for you from your daughter. 
From my daughter? 
Yes, sir. A Kim Bauer. 
It's been put through to a land line just inside that door. 
Thank you. 
I'll be right back. 
I promise. 
Take as long as you need. 
I'm not going anywhere. 
I love you. 
I'll be right back. 
Hey, Kim? 
Any word on Logan? 
No. My guess 
is he'll try to cut a deal. 
He'll resign without a fight in exchange for clemency. 
He doesn't deserve clemency. 
No, but the country doesn't deserve a long impeachment process, either, with everything that's happened. 
In any event, we can expect Hal Gordon to be sworn in as president soon. 
Which means this will probably be the last time I see this place. 
I don't think so. 
Not if I have anything to do with it, and I will. 
You'll be back here running CTU. 
Thank you. 
I appreciate that. 
When I came in here last night to save the day, I was a little bit condescending and tactless, to say the least. 
I had no idea what you were up against. 
I'm sorry. 
No. No need to apologize. 
Mistakes were made. 
You were right to come in with a firm hand. 
Well, I better go. 
Karen. 
I was thinking of getting some breakfast before going home. 
I have to go over to Division for one last briefing. 
Bureaucracy. 
Rain check? 
Sure. 
Chloe, really good work today. 
You, too. 
I found this in Edgar's possessions. 
I thought you should have it. 
Thanks. 
Hey. 
What's all this, then? 
A friend of mine who died today. 
You, um, do you want to talk about it? 
Yeah? Come on. 
Jack? 
Oh, my God. 
Agent Davis, Jack Bauer's missing! 
Attention, all units. 
We have a missing agent: Jack Bauer. 
I repeat, we have a missing agent: Jack Bauer. 
...the lower level. 
Put three men on perimeter search. 
Report back. 
You surely must be aware, Mr. Bauer, 
that China has a long memory. 
Only 18 months ago, you invaded our territory and killed our consul. 
Did you really think that we would forget, hmm? 
I know how this works. 
I need to make one phone call. 
Please... 
just one phone call. 
Kill me. 
Just... 
kill me. 
Kill you? 
You're far too valuable to kill, Mr. Bauer. 
AUDREY: I'm on the phone with a man who claims to James Nathanson. 
He was Walt Cummings' contact. 
He says he has information about the terrorists, but he will only talk to you. 
JACK: What do you want with me? 
CUMMINGS: Protection. 
The terrorists you're after are trying to kill me. 
What makes you think I'm not gonna kill you myself? 
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas from being released on American soil. 
So do I. 
Nathanson, stay down! 
Stay down! 
What's on the chip? 
Please, what's on the chip! 
O'Brian. 
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox. 
CHLOE: The decryption element kicked out a company called Omicron International. 
Pull up their senior executive roster, See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list. 
Okay, here it is. 
Senior Vice President of Research and Development. 
Send me the decrypted files over to my PDA. 
That's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now, Jack. 
The two of you are up to something, and I'm not gonna stand for it. 
This is a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority. 
Lynn, we're all on the same side. 
If you're father wasn't the Secretary of Defense, I'd have you thrown out of here. 
I don't have that problem with you. 
I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees. 
And you waste it. 
We were betrayed, Bierko. 
Someone must pay. 
I agree. 
This is President Logan. 
What is it you want? 
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade. 
If you refuse to cooperate, I will have no choice but to release all the Sentox nerve gas. 
He wants to assassinate Suvarov. 
Don't negotiate with them! 
Isn't that the point of the treaty you just signed? 
Mr. President, I'm glad 
that we have this opportunity to thank you and Mrs. Logan 
for your hospitality. 
The motorcade will take service roads to the 118... 
Mrs. Logan... 
Aaron, I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs. 
I'll ride up front. 
No, that's not necessary. 
Yes, it is. 
Yes? 
Where is the motorcade now? 
Just getting on the 118. 
How long before they reach the ambush point? 
About 40 minutes. 
Good. We'll be waiting. 
Get everything ready. 
Mr. President, 
I asked Secret Service to sent a threat assessment for President Suvarov's route. 
The most vulnerable point is here, the downtown corridor. 
This is the most likely point of attack. 
If an ambush were to occur. 
It's going to happen, Mike. 
We gave the terrorists Suvarov's route. 
I need to come up with a public response. 
I need to convince the world that Suvarov's death only underscores the importance of this antiterrorism treaty that we just signed. 
I'll, uh, begin working on a statement, sir. 
Yes? 
Thank you. I'll... 
let the president know. 
What? What is it, Mike? 
What's going on? 
Who was that? 
Agent Pierce. Um, 
I don't know how to tell you this. 
Just tell me. 
Mrs. Logan is riding 
with the Suvarovs. 
What are you talking about? 
Sir, she got into that limousine. 
Oh, my God. 
Didn't-didn't the Secret Service try to stop her?! 
There was no reason to stop her. 
The motorcade is under Secret Service escort. 
As far as they're concerned, she's not in any danger. 
She wants me to call back the motorcade-- she's trying to save the Suvarovs. 
Should I alert them? 
Yes! 
No, stop, wait. 
If we warn them, the terrorists are going to set off the gas. 
Where are they now? 
They're still on the 118. 
Get my wife on the phone. 
MRS. SUVAROV: 
My aunt visited Los Angeles in the 1950s. 
She told me this area was filled with orange groves, but I haven't seen any. 
I suppose it's all been built over, no? 
Martha? 
Yes. I-I... 
I was just trying to remember. 
Um, I think your aunt's memory is better than mine. 
I visited here when I was a child, but I don't recall the orange groves. 
Yeah, this is Pierce. 
Mrs. Logan, 
it's the president for you on line one. 
Thank you, Aaron. 
Hello, Charles. 
Listen to me carefully. 
I want you... 
Yes, I think they had a wonderful visit. 
And they would very much like for us to come to Moscow. 
Wouldn't that be lovely? 
I want you to tell the Suvarovs that I need you back here. 
I'm gonna have one of the follow cars bring you back. 
I don't think so, Charles. 
Tell them now, while I'm on the phone. 
Martha, I know that you want me to call the motorcade back, but... 
the terrorists were very specific: if-if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, they're gonna release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations. 
Well, I... guess we'll just have 
to figure something out before that happens. 
We're trying! We're trying, 
but we haven't found them yet. 
You need to get out of the car. 
Okay, I should go now, but you'll call me Martha... 
if there's any change of plans? 
Damn it, Martha! 
Okay, bye-bye. 
I'll-I'll talk to you soon. 
She won't get out of the limousine. 
My God. 
We got to do something, Mike; we got to get her out of the car. 
I could have, uh, one of the trail cars stop them and force her out, say that I need her back here. 
You could, but... if Martha 
is desperate to save the Suvarovs, she might feel that the only remaining option is to tell them the truth. 
And Suvarov will know that I gave him up for assassination. 
Sir, do you want me to recall the motorcade or not? 
Edgar, meet me in the server room in a few minutes. 
Am I in trouble? 
No, but there's something very important that we need to discuss. 
Okay. 
And, Edgar, don't tell anyone where you're going. 
This needs to stay between us. 
Sure. 
What did Audrey Raines want? 
She was just going over some DOD protocols. 
I thought you were supposed to be monitoring chatter. 
We are. 
Why isn't it on my screen, Carrie? 
I didn't think you wanted us to mirror everything to your system. 
I thought you wanted to save time. 
I do want to save time. 
It saves me time by not having to clean up more mistakes. 
Mirror everything until we've secured this nerve gas. 
Is that clear? 
Yes, sir. 
The thumb drive data Jack sent us checks out as authentic. 
It's time-stamped by DOD and CIA. 
So Omicron International did make Sentox gas for the military. 
Yeah, and some terrorists found out about it. 
Or worse-- they were in contact with Omicron. 
Who is this Henderson? 
CHLOE: Christopher Henderson, Senior Vice President, R&D. 
Jack said he knew him, but he wouldn't talk about it. 
Is he connected with the Sentox? 
Doesn't say; it just said he was a senior VP. 
All right. 
Yeah? 
Jack, we've authenticated the thumb drive data. 
Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military. 
Okay, I'm almost there look, I need you to work something up that gets me through the front door without them knowing I'm CTU. 
Do you think it's necessary to go in covertly? 
Yeah. There's someone 
I need to talk to. 
I don't want him to see me coming. 
Christopher Henderson? 
Yeah. 
Who is he? 
Someone I used to work for. 
Where? 
CTU. He was the man 
who recruited me. 
You've never mentioned him. 
I know. 
Things ended badly between us. 
What happened? 
I was part of an investigation that uncovered evidence that implicated him in the sale of classified intelligence to defense contractors. 
We never had enough evidence to indict him, but he lost his job, his command. 
Even as he was walking out the door, he maintained his innocence. 
He never forgave me for being part of the investigation. 
Are you convinced he did it? 
I was at the time. 
Jack, Chloe can't find a direct connection between the Sentox and Henderson. 
Trust me, if Omicron was making Sentox, legally or illegally, Henderson knew about it. 
Get back to me as soon as you got my cover. 
All right, I'm on it. 
What are you doing here, Chloe? 
Same thing you're doing here. 
Edgar, thank you for coming. 
Look, whatever this is about, I don't have a lot of time. 
We don't have a single active lead on this nerve gas. 
That's not exactly true. 
Jack is following a lead out in the field. 
How do you know? 
I just spoke with him. 
Everyone's looking for him. 
Lynn issued an arrest warrant. 
That's why we wanted to talk to you, Edgar. 
Lynn is losing it first he went after Jack, and then he took Bill Buchanan out of play. 
Lynn is incapable of leading us through this crisis. 
So you're both working behind his back? 
We're afraid that if we bring him into this, he might derail the only good lead that we have. 
We have to help Jack locate the nerve gas before it's too late. 
What do you want from me? 
Cover for Chloe until Jack reports back. 
Please. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Okay, fine. Yeah. 
That was Secret Service. 
As you can see, the motorcade continues to make its way to the airport without incident. 
There won't be any warning, Mike. 
When these people attack, they will be fast and they will be merciless. 
You can count on that. 
I have to talk to this man. 
M-Maybe I can convince him to hold off. 
Hold off? 
Just until Martha gets out of the car. 
She wasn't supposed to be a part of this in the first place. 
Sir, I don't think that would change his plan. 
He has to know that my wife's in the car! 
I can't lose her, Mike. 
The only way to keep Martha safe is for me to call Secret Service and tell them to turn the motorcade around. 
What about... 
what about CTU? 
Do they have any active leads on the nerve gas? 
As of five minutes ago, they don't... 
nothing that would help our situation. 
What am I missing, Mike?! 
There's got to be some way out, something that I'm not seeing. 
You're not missing anything. 
Any action we take to save Martha would also save the Suvarovs, and if that happens, the terrorists will release the gas. 
Unfortunately, it's that simple. 
Then there's nothing more we can do, Mike. 
Unless I warn them. 
Martha's going to die with the Suvarovs. 
Aaron... 
have there been any changes? 
Excuse me? 
Changes to what, Mrs. Logan? 
I-I was just wondering if there had been any changes to our route. 
We haven't gotten any revised instructions, ma'am. 
Thank you. 
You sure you're all right, Martha? 
Yes, yes. 
I just wanted to make sure we don't run into any heavy traffic. 
Understood. 
Those protocols should be coming over shortly. 
Who were you on the phone with? 
Homeland Security. 
I gave you specific orders to have everyone's systems mirrored to mine. 
I've been doing that. 
But you're not finished, yet somehow you have time to chat with Homeland Security. 
They needed us to give them updated code sets. 
It'll just take another minute. 
No, it won't. 
Stiles, finish her task. 
Carrie, you're done. 
What do you... mean, done? 
Fired. You don't 
work here anymore. 
STILES: Mr. McGill, 
it's not her fault. 
She just... 
Edgar, one more word out of you, you walk out with her. 
What's it gonna be? 
Where's Agent O'Brian? 
She had to step away for a minute. 
Where? 
I don't know. 
Jack, I'm still trying to get your credentials into Omicron's system. 
You can't get into the building without them. 
What's the problem? 
Omicron's systems don't refresh often enough. 
We need to push this page in manually. 
Okay, I'm in. 
You're going in under the name of John Barrie. 
B-A-R-R-I-E. 
You're with a company called Eclipse LLC. 
John Barrie, Eclipse LLC. 
I got it. 
Hold on a second; she hasn't planted it yet. 
Chloe. What are you 
doing in here? 
I asked her to help me. 
She doesn't work for you, Ms. Raines; she works for me. 
But I don't, and DOD has assignment priority over CTU. 
We're in the middle of a real-time investigation, and we're understaffed. 
Chloe's a department head you can't just take her away from me. 
AUDREY: I'm not taking her from you. 
We needed a system patch on a server, and Chloe's the only one who could fix it. 
Well, then you come to me and you ask me. 
Everything in this office runs through me! 
Lynn, we are all trying to do the same thing. 
Can we please just get past this? 
Yeah, I'm past it. 
I want Chloe back. 
Okay, I'm finished here. 
Sorry, Mr. McGill, 
it won't happen again. 
Good afternoon. 
John Barrie with Eclipse. 
I've got a 4:30 with R&D. 
Thumb print, please. 
Go on in. 
Thank you. 
MAN ( over intercom ): Well, I'll tell you what you do. 
You kick the McAvoy meeting to next week on Thursday, but you keep everything else. 
What about your trip to Washington? 
That's right. Okay. 
Well, I got to talk to Kagan tomorrow morning. 
I'll get back to you then. 
Can I help you, sir? 
Yeah, I'm sorry. 
I'm a little lost. I was looking 
for the men's room. 
Over there, second door. 
Thank you. 
Audrey Raines. 
It's Jack. I need you 
to lose the secretary. 
Her name is Joanna Tandy. 
All right, I'll take care of it. 
Thanks. 
Christopher Henderson's office. 
Ms. Tandy? 
Yes? 
Jane Espenson from accounting. 
We need you to come down now and double-check some of these invoices. 
What invoices? 
It's a little difficult to explain over the phone. 
Would you mind popping down just for a minute? 
Fine. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Henderson, there's a problem 
down in accounting. 
I'll be right back. 
Jack? Jack? 
Just for the record, I never believed you were dead. 
What are you doing here? 
Earlier this morning, terrorists gained control of a large quantity of Sentox VX nerve gas. 
Omicron manufactured it. 
When I pulled up the executive list, your name was on it. 
Sure my name's on it I work here. 
Omicron had the contract. 
We manufacture this stuff. 
But every single gram of it went to the Department of Defense. 
It's all been accounted for. 
Well, that can't be true, now, can it? 
We have confirmation that terrorists are in control of 19 canisters of Sentox! 
What are you accusing me now of, Jack? 
Being in bed with terrorists? 
I'm following the leads! 
Well, the leads are wrong. 
DOD destroyed the entire stockpile. 
Sentox was responsible for the death of the people in the Sunrise Hills Mall less than two hours ago. 
The news said it was chlorine gas. 
That was a cover story to stop a widespread panic! 
Come on, Christopher, you know how this works! 
The terrorists have threatened to release the rest of the gas. 
( quietly ): Good God. 
Well, whoever's implicating me in this knows my history with CTU. 
I mean, I'm an easy target. 
This is not a coincidence. 
Look, Jack, I know there's dirt between us, but I swear to you, I got nothing to do with this. 
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. 
I can't afford to take your word on this. 
Well, you're gonna have to take my word. 
11 people died in that mall! 
Hundreds of thousands of others will if they release the rest of the Sentox. 
You're not hearing me, Jack! 
I had nothing to do with this! 
Then prove it to me. 
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program. 
I'm doing it now. 
The entire operation was run from a bunker across the campus. 
Let me see the bunker. 
NSA chatter analysis just came in. 
I decoded some words and phrases. 
What were they saying? 
It's too scrambled to make any complete sentences, but number strings keep coming up. 
5, 110, 10. 
Freeways? 
Those are the routes President Suvarov's taking to the airport. 
The only other phrase I could decode refers to the downtown corridor. 
How long ago did this chatter start? 
About 30 minutes ago. 
Come on. 
Can we expand the search area? 
I've got CTU air surveillance on everything east of Glendale. 
What about the north? 
Edwards Air Force Base is giving us support there. 
We're still at a dead end on finding new leads with the nerve gas. 
Excuse me, Mr. McGill, we think 
there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade. 
What? 
Edgar just monitored some chatter from NSA and ran a threat assessment. 
What are you doing analyzing chatter that isn't related to finding the nerve gas? 
It came through on one of my filters. 
The point is, sir, we found something. 
Don't you want to alert Secret Service considering that Suvarov is on his way to the airport? 
Based on an unsubstantiated theory from a couple of analysts? 
I think I've been embarrassed enough for one day. 
Can we at least devote some limited resources to try to confirm this threat? 
I'm sorry. 
Maybe I wasn't clear. No. 
Now go downstairs and focus on what you're supposed to be doing. 
I don't think it would be a bad idea to pass along the intel. 
Well, I do. 
I don't want to hear another word about it. 
Yes? 
Our men are in place. 
How far out are they? 
The motorcade will be there in less than 20 minutes. 
Are you sure no one is going to interfere with us? 
I don't think so. 
Logan knows the consequences if that happens. 
But be alert. 
Make sure they haven't placed any of their people near you. 
If police show up, we'll deal with them. 
Good. 
I'll call you when it's over. 
Let's go, let's go. 
Keep them out. 
If things don't go as planned, I'll use them here. 
I'm busy, Ms. Raines. 
Lynn, I just looked at this chatter report and I definitely think that we need to let Secret Service know of the threat. 
I'm not going to repeat my orders to every person in this office individually. 
My people are not going to chase that white elephant. 
They're busy trying to locate 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas. 
Has it occurred to you that if this threat is real, then it's likely that the terrorists who have the Sentox nerve gas are the same ones that are planning this attack? 
This is an unverified threat! 
If you want to hand it off to NSA, be my guest. 
NSA can't recall the motorcade without going through a time-consuming approval process. 
Good. 
That process helps eliminate false threats. 
Look, we don't have that time. 
According... 
Ms. Raines, Ms. Raines, 
this office has made enough mistakes for one day, and I intend to stop the bleeding. 
Now let my people focus on their work or I will have you escorted out of here. 
Thank you. 
I need to call this in to Secret Service, but they won't act on it unless Lynn verifies it. 
He's never going to back you up on that. 
Yes, he is. 
I need you to hack into Lynn's account for me. 
I'll forge a message to Secret Service and make it look like it came from him. 
That's illegal. 
Fine. 
Edgar, I need you to put a blanket on my sub-net to make it look like I'm doing something else. 
We could all end up in jail. 
Think about it for a second. 
The Russian president, his wife, about 35 Secret Service, all dead in a few minutes. 
All right, but for the record, this is not a good idea. 
All right, I'll compose a message. 
As soon as you have the forged verification file, call me. 
Curtis. 
Excuse me. 
We need to talk. 
What is it? 
We've got a problem with Lynn. 
Yeah, I know. 
He's not listening to anybody. 
Well, it's going to start costing lives. 
Just give him some time. 
He'll come around. 
Curtis, we don't have time. 
We've got to get Bill back out here. 
That's not going to happen, Audrey. 
We need to make it happen. 
What are you suggesting? 
Section 112. 
On what grounds? 
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU. 
I may not agree with all his choices, but going from there to mentally unfit? 
That's a stretch. 
No, it's not and you know it. 
You've seen him. 
With Bill in custody, you are the ranking agent. 
You are the only one that can invoke it. 
I don't know, Audrey... 
Yes, you do. 
Curtis, CTU is barely functional. 
You are the one that can turn it around. 
Even if I agreed, Section 112 requires documentation, testimony, a lot of groundwork. 
The record of what is going on right now is documentation enough. 
Curtis... 
please. 
Think about it. 
I will. 
Good. Thank you. 
Mr. President. 
Come in, Mike. 
The motorcade is only 15 minutes away from the airport. 
Yeah. 
My father always told me that life was about problem solving. 
That every problem had a solution. 
You tell me where the solution is on this one. 
I don't have an answer, Mr. President. 
But if you want the Suvarov motorcade to turn back, I need to do it now. 
We know the terrorists are willing to kill civilians. 
And the low... the low end 
of the casualty range on this one is... 
100,000 lives. 
Yes, sir. 
I decided before that I couldn't risk all those lives to save one man the Russian president. 
I can't risk those lives now... 
( voice breaking ): even to save my own wife. 
Damn you, Martha, for putting me in this position. 
You brought it on yourself. 
Mike... 
Pray with me, Mike. 
Uh, Mr. President, 
with all due respect, this is a personal matter. 
I don't... 
Please, Mike. 
How much longer until we can send this out? 
A couple of minutes. 
I've almost hacked in. 
We don't have a couple of minutes. 
EDGAR: I'm almost there. 
Oh, no. 
Lynn cut us off. 
What do I do? 
I think it's too late to do anything. 
Mr. Stiles, 
did you really think I wouldn't notice that you were trying to access my com? 
Lynn, listen, we need to talk... 
Shut up! 
These people are working against CTU protocols. 
That means they're working against me. 
Lynn, what is this? 
We were trying to warn Secret Service on an attack on Suvarov's motorcade. 
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles 
and Ms. O'Brian 
put them in holding. 
And then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU. 
I can't do that. 
Yes, you can, Curtis. 
It's a direct order. 
Now do it. 
You forced them to work covertly. 
They had no choice. 
You're not behaving rationally, Lynn. 
LYNN: You and you, take them all into custody including Mr. Manning. 
CURTIS: If you try to carry out that command, I will draw my weapon. 
If he draws his weapon, shoot him. 
CURTIS: This situation is already getting out of control. 
Don't make it worse. 
McGILL: Why are you hesitating?! 
I gave you an order. 
Now do it! 
What would you like me to do, Mr. Manning? 
What?! 
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command under the incapacity clause of Section 112. 
You'll do no such thing. 
Take him away. 
You can't do that. 
He can't do this. 
Don't touch me. 
This is an unjustified usurpation of my authority. 
Do you hear me? 
We're in the middle of a crisis. 
There are going to be repercussions. 
Everyone involved in this is going to face prosecution. 
This is Curtis Manning. 
Release Bill Buchanan from holding and inform Division that he's been reinstated as director of CTU under Section 112 provisions. 
Everyone, get back to your stations. 
Fill me in. 
Chloe and Edgar detected chatter indicating a possible attack on President Suvarov's motorcade en route to the airport. 
How'd they get Suvarov's route? 
We don't know, but the most likely point of intercept is the downtown corridor. 
Has Secret Service been notified? 
Lynn refused to do so. 
Notify Secret Service now. 
I need your level one access code to override the firewall Lynn put up. 
Here. 
I need Carrie back. 
He fired her for no reason. 
Have security reinstate her. 
Edgar, pull up satellite and all possible intercept points, and call the president. 
Yes, sir. 
Where are we on the location of the nerve gas canisters? 
No substantial progress. 
What about the lead Jack was following? 
He traced the Sentox back to Omicron International where it was manufactured. 
Is that where Jack is now? 
Yes. 
EDGAR: Mr. Buchanan, 
president's on the line. 
Mr. President, 
we have intelligence that indicates President Suvarov's motorcade may be attacked in the next few minutes. 
Is that so? 
Yes, sir. 
We are in the process of notifying Secret Service. 
What we can tell you is that if the attack happens it will occur in or around the downtown area. 
The motorcade is approaching that area now, sir. 
Mr. President? 
Bill. Mike Novick. 
The president is at a loss for words. 
His wife is in the Suvarov's limousine. 
Thank you. 
You've done a good job. 
What do we do? 
There's nothing we can do, sir. 
CTU is informing the Secret Service. 
They'll no doubt take defensive measures, which makes the attack substantially less likely to succeed. 
AARON: Yes, sir. 
Protocol red. 
Protocol red. 
Hold on tight. 
We're turning around we just received intelligence about a threat to the motorcade. 
They're turning around! 
We're under attack! 
We need backup now! 
It's a missile fire. 
The motorcade's been hit. 
A-Aaron? 
Aaron? 
Oh, my God... 
( softly ): Aaron... Aaron... 
It's okay. 
Are you okay? 
Novick. 
Yeah, Frank. 
How badly? 
And what about Mrs. Logan? 
I will. Thank you. 
Your wife survived the attack. 
CTU intervened in time. 
Thank God. 
What about the Suvarovs? 
They were shaken up, but, uh, they'll be okay. 
He's going to think I tipped off CTU. 
It won't matter to him that I tried to keep my end of the bargain. 
I agree. 
????? 
All the work on the Sentox project was run out of here. 
How restricted was the access? 
Extremely. For security reasons, 
each defense contract was run out of its own separate dedicated bunker, each bunker's a completely sealed environment. 
Nothing gets in and nothing gets out. 
This is gonna take some time. 
I've got to merge some files, find out who's working on this project. 
You're Senior Vice President and you don't know? 
Give me a break, Jack there's 8,000 people that work for this company. 
I got to run a sort it's gonna take me a minute. 
So who's the honcho over at CTU now? 
Bill Buchanan. 
( chuckles ): Buchanan. What a stiff. 
No wonder everything's going to hell over there. 
You guys keep getting rid of everybody who can do their job. 
You made your own bed. 
You accused the wrong man, Jack. 
I wasn't the lead investigator; I showed them what I found. 
I was framed. 
By who? 
Nina Myers, George Mason... 
Who knows? 
But I'll tell you, the one thing that just hangs on me, I'll tell you, the one thing that just... 
hurts me is that you didn't believe me. 
You made it impossible to believe you. 
How could I possibly defend you? 
You wouldn't even defend yourself. 
No one gave me the chance. 
Okay, we got something here. 
Lead scientist, head of Project Sentox Alan Burkett, PhD. 
I'm gonna need to speak to him. 
Well, you're gonna have a problem. 
Died in a helicopter crash in Geneva two years ago. 
Let's see what else we got. 
This is bizarre. 
Two other senior scientists on the Sentox project one drowned on a diving trip in the Bahamas, the other burned to death in a car accident two weeks later. 
What the hell is going on? 
CTU's gonna have to break it down. 
How do I upload the files and get them ready to transfer? 
We need I.T. 
They're next-door. 
I'll get somebody to help us. 
I'll CTU know that we're sending the files over. 
Hello? 
Damn it. 
Oh, my God. 
How could I be so stupid? 
WOMAN ( over phone ): Yes? 
Yeah, it's me. 
I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the thumb drive CTU does not have enough information to hurt us. 
What about Bauer? 
Well, in about one minute, he'll be dead. 
Tell the media we don't know how the terrorists found out about the Suvarovs' route. 
We're looking into it now. 
Mike, I've been thinking that... 
diplomatically, we should play up the fact that Martha was in the vehicle. 
Why is that, sir? 
It will get rid of any suspicion that we might have been... 
( phone rings ) shortchanging Suvarov's security. 
There he is. 
Hello. 
I thought we had an understanding. 
I had nothing to do with this. 
You have to believe me. 
It was your job to make sure no one interfered with the attack on the Suvarovs. 
It happened outside of my authority. 
I told no one. 
If Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens. 
Mr. President, 
this is our final conversation. 
Good-bye. 
No. Wait! 
What we're doing here is very simple. 
We're going to release a certain substance so that it flows into your pipelines. 
Take the canisters to the main distribution tank quickly. 
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet? 
No. 
Explain. 
We rolled his car, but he survived and got away. 
It was sloppy work, we'll make it right. 
Well, you damn well better. 
You know what's at stake. 
Get down! 
( gunfire ) Get in the car. 
( gunfire ) It's the truth. 
Audrey Raines was my contact at the Department of Defense. 
You met with her face-to-face? 
Yes. 
Damn it, Audrey! 
Tell me the truth! 
I am telling you the truth. 
You already lied to me once. 
You tell me what you know or I promise you this will become very unpleasant. 
Bill, we have a connection between Collette Stenger and Henderson. 
She received eight calls from him she didn't tell us about. 
That voids her agreement, it's off. 
You have three seconds to tell me where the target is or I will kill you. 
Where is the target?! 
A natural gas distribution center. 
Our analysts tell us once the Sentox hits the main tank, it goes right into the pipes where it becomes impossible to stop. 
From there, it goes straight into people's homes. 
JACK: Sentox is already in the system. 
Give me the C-4 and a timer, then get these people out of here. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
In order to deliver the Sentox, it had to mix with natural gas. 
If we can ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated. 
Bierko! 
Jack, that's it, the main tanks are going. 
Get out! 
BUCHANAN: Jack, respond. 
Curtis, Curtis, this is Audrey. 
Any sign of Jack? 
Nothing so far. 
I've got men searching the main tank area. 
Fire and rescue units just arrived. 
They're assessing the situation now. 
Chloe, what are we getting from the air monitors? 
Come on, Jack. 
Chloe. 
Just minimal trace readings of the nerve agent. 
Well below danger levels. 
It looks like the Sentox was incinerated in the blast. 
Jack's plan worked. 
I'm going to brief the White House. 
Apprise me of any developments. 
Miles. 
Curtis, have we done a full search of the area for Jack? 
It's underway. 
We know he hasn't gone out the north exit. 
CTU, Jack's okay. 
Get a medical team over here now! 
Jack! 
Give me a hand. 
Bierko! 
Bierko! 
Bierko! 
I need him conscious. 
Yes, sir. 
The nerve gas, did it leave the plant? 
There's no trace of it. 
Explosion worked. 
Good. 
He's going into severe shock. 
We need to transport him now. 
I want him taken back to CTU Medical. 
Yes, sir. 
Curtis, organize an escort team. 
You get him back to CTU alive. 
You got it. 
On my count. 
Three, two, one. 
Let's go. 
( cell phone rings ) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
Is your line still secure? 
Yes. 
What's your status on Henderson? 
Henderson's still an active protocol. 
You need to make him a priority. 
Bill, listen to me. 
I know Henderson. 
He couldn't have planned this. 
He's a soldier and a patriot. 
However misguided, he believes what he's doing right now is right for this country. 
He was willing to let his wife die in order to protect someone, someone very powerful. 
Who? 
I don't know. 
Bill, I'm scared. 
I think this is bigger than anything we could ever have imagined. 
Karen, you're not hearing me. 
They managed to prevent an attack, but that doesn't negate the fact that CTU's performance has been comprised of one misstep after another. 
I'm not disputing that, Mr. Vice President. 
Then why the hesitation to carry out your mandate and have Homeland absorb CTU? 
CTU is still actively looking for Christopher Henderson. 
A shakeup right now could hamper that search. 
I'm not going to hold up this takeover because of a procedural mop up. 
Henderson will be caught, you can be sure of that. 
Is that understood? 
Clearly. 
Whatever bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through, that's your business. 
Just get it done. 
Yes, sir. 
And keep me informed. 
I guess we should get started. 
Buchanan is not going to take this lying down. 
Despite what the vice president said, CTU just saved a lot of lives. 
If Buchanan mounts a challenge, it will be seen in that light. 
This action could be easily reversed. 
If we were to find someone who would go on record citing Buchanan's mismanagement, how he superseded Lynn McGill's authority, how he allowed CTU to be compromised... 
go a long way to mitigating his successes, give us the protection we need. 
Buchanan's people are extremely loyal. 
I'm not thinking about a member of CTU. 
I'm thinking of Audrey Raines. 
She was here all morning, she saw what went on. 
And her loyalty is split between CTU and DOD. 
We could take advantage of that. 
Let me draft a statement and present it to her. 
BUCHANAN: We're being rolled up, Audrey. 
Homeland's taking over. 
That's impossible. 
Karen told me herself. 
No, they can't do that, not after what you've accomplished today. 
I'd like to think we've earned a reprieve, but I doubt it. 
CTU is in the middle of an investigation. 
Henderson is still at large. 
I know, it doesn't make any sense. 
Karen's taking orders from Vice President Gardner. 
He wants this to happen. 
Why? 
I've been asking myself the same question. 
HENDERSON: Yeah. 
Well, how in the hell did you lose him? 
Palmer knocked Cobb out and retrieved his weapon. 
We tried to pursue, but someone came to Palmer's aid. 
Who? 
That's unclear. 
They got away. 
All right. 
We're going to a fallback, scrub the scene and get over here. 
Yes, sir. 
You're all right, Mr. Palmer. 
Just take it slow. 
Aaron? 
We're at the presidential retreat. 
Can you try to sit up? 
I think we need to get you looked at, sir. 
No, no, Aaron, there's not enough time for that. 
I'm all right. 
Then maybe you can explain to me what's going on. 
Why were those men trying to kill you? 
Because David had a source inside the White House and someone is trying to prevent me from seeing her. 
Who is this source? 
Mrs. Logan's assistant. 
Evelyn Martin? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, she and David were trading e-mails. 
Listen, Aaron, I need to find out the content of those messages. 
I think David was killed because of information Evelyn gave him. 
Mrs. Logan, 
I drafted a letter to the families of the victims at the Sunrise Hills Mall. 
It's here for your review. 
Thank you. 
And your schedule's there as well. 
You have a 9:00 a.m. 
with the press office and the president wants you in on his morning briefing. 
Evelyn... 
you all right? 
I'm fine. 
Just tired. 
It's been a long day. 
I'm surprised any of us got through it. 
Oh, do you have your credentials with you? 
There's still a curfew in place. 
I have them with me. 
Good. 
Try to get some rest. 
Good night. 
Good night. 
Evelyn. 
Hi. 
I really need to talk to you. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer, 
I need to go home. 
Ma'am. 
Please. 
This won't take but a second. 
You were sending e-mails to my brother, Evelyn. Why? 
Mr. Palmer, I don't know 
what you're talking about. 
I traced the IP account. 
I traced it right to your address, so, yes, you do know what I'm talking about. 
I need to know what you told David. 
I didn't tell him anything. 
Evelyn, I have the record of your correspondence. 
David deleted the content on the messages, but I know, Evelyn, I know you were in contact with him, so please don't lie to me again. 
Tell me what I need to know. 
Someone killed David they killed him and they just tried to kill me. 
Now, I think they knew I was coming here to see you. 
So I think that means we're both in danger, don't you? 
Please, I have to go now. 
Tell me what I need! 
Talk to me! 
I can't. 
They kidnapped my little girl. 
They kidnapped my little girl. 
They said they would give Amy back to me if I gave them the evidence. 
What evidence? 
I have proof about who is behind everything that's happened today. 
They're going to kill my baby. 
Evelyn, okay... 
They're going to kill... 
Listen to me, all right? Listen. 
Even if you turn over this evidence, they're not just going to give you back your daughter and let you go. 
That's not what these people do. 
Now, you've got to trust me, Evelyn. 
Please, talk to me. 
If I may? 
Mr. Palmer's right. 
You know too much. 
They'll kill you both. 
I'll give you the evidence that I have if you get me back my daughter. 
I pulled up Henderson's work records for the past ten years. 
It's a lot of material. 
I'll start data-mining, see if there's anything we can use to track him down. 
That's Chloe O'Brian. 
SHARI: Who are those people? 
That's Jim Hill, from Homeland. 
I'm Jim Hill, Homeland Security. 
Could you show me your station. 
Chloe O'Brian? 
Yeah? 
I'm taking over your station. 
I'll need all your relevant access codes. 
Who are you? 
What's going on here? 
May I have your attention, please? 
These men and women are from Homeland Security. 
I've just authorized a unit-wide backslash protocol. 
CTU is being absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I realize this is sudden, and this has been a very difficult day, but let's all cooperate to make this transition as smooth as possible. 
There is still work to be done. 
Vladimir Bierko is en route to CTU, and Christopher Henderson remains an open protocol. 
Thank you. 
Ms. Raines, would 
you mind joining me in the Situation Room? 
Why? 
We need to speak in private. 
Fine. 
( phone rings ) This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's  Wayne Palmer. 
Wayne. 
Are you all right? 
I just heard about that explosion at the gas plant. 
Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, Wayne, 
I wish I could tell you that all the people that were responsible for your brother's assassination are in custody, but I can't. 
Yeah, Well, maybe I can help you with that. 
How? 
Jack, I'm at President Logan's retreat. 
I'm here with Evelyn Martin, Mrs. Logan's personal assistant. 
What does Evelyn Martin have to do with this? 
She says she has proof there were other people involved in the plot to kill my brother. 
And I believe her. 
Who? 
She won't tell me. 
Why not? 
Her eight-year-old daughter's been kidnapped. 
They're going to kill her unless Evelyn hands over the evidence. 
This has to be Henderson. 
They're supposed to call any minute with a place to meet. 
Okay. I want to be 
on that call when it comes in. 
CTU will provide operational support. 
We're going to need a place to meet. 
I passed an old barn about a mile west of the retreat off Service Road 19. 
Service Road 19. 
I'll be there in 20 minutes. 
See you then. 
Jack's going to meet us. 
We should go. 
Evelyn, listen. 
They may be watching you, so I don't think we should leave together. 
What do you want to do? 
We'll separate. 
Get to your car, and we'll meet up in the parking lot. 
I'll see you soon. 
"...the acting director's 
failure "to enhance security measures, especially in the light "of the heightened threat, effectively "invited the subsequent attack that resulted in loss of personnel." 
You can't possibly expect me to sign this. 
It's a complete distortion of today's event designed to place blame on Bill Buchanan and CTU. 
But you would agree that today's attacks represent a serious intelligence failure that needs to be addressed. 
Thanks to CTU, hundreds of thousands of people are alive who would otherwise be dead. 
But, if CTU had been operating effectively, those people would never have been at risk. 
I couldn't more strongly disagree with this statement. 
Well, I'm disappointed with your decision, but I appreciate your loyalty. 
Of course. 
Oh, just to confirm. 
As on-site liaison for DOD, you participated in today's decision-making process. 
What's your point? 
Serious mistakes were made here today that resulted in the loss of American lives. 
It would be a shame to see the taint of CTU's mismanagement spread to your agency... 
and your career. 
By signing this, you isolate the fallout for today's mistakes to Bill Buchanan and CTU... 
where it belongs. 
I'm proud of what we did here today. 
The people of CTU are heroes, especially Bill Buchanan. 
This takeover is completely unwarranted, and I won't help you justify it. 
( phone rings ) Hello. 
Audrey, it's Jack. 
Jack, where are you? 
I'm on my way to see Wayne Palmer. 
Wayne Palmer? 
Wayne just told me that Evelyn Martin, Senior Aide to the First Lady has evidence that would prove who was really behind David Palmer's assassination, but she won't give the evidence to Wayne because her daughter's been kidnapped in an effort to try and keep her quiet. 
I think Henderson's behind this. 
They want to make a trade: the evidence for the girl. 
My God, Jack. 
Yeah, I'm going to need you to retask a satellite to those coordinates I'll have them in a few minutes. 
Jack, that could be difficult right now. 
Why? 
CTU is being rolled up. 
Karen Hayes is replacing everyone with people from Homeland. 
What are you talking about? 
That doesn't make sense. 
I know. 
Even if she has a reason to, we're in the middle of tracking down Christopher Henderson. 
We'll never be able to bring her team up to speed. 
I know she's taking orders from Vice President Gardner himself. 
Gardner. 
Jack, maybe you should talk to Karen directly. 
No. 
She's the one in control here. 
When I was interrogating Henderson, it was obvious that he was protecting someone, someone very powerful. 
He was willing to let his wife die rather than give him up. 
and now, all of a sudden, Vice President Gardner is shutting down CTU when we're actually in a position to bring Henderson in? 
Do you really think that Gardner's involved with this? 
We can't afford to take the chance that he's not. 
All right, what do you want me to do? 
I want you to get Chloe to retask the satellite. 
I'll get the coordinates over to you. 
Jack, Chloe has been let go, along with the rest of her department. 
Audrey, I need the satellite. 
Just figure out a way to get Chloe back on. 
All right, all right, I'll call you back. 
MILES: I could approach some of the senior CTU staffers. 
I told you, that's a waste of time. 
They're worried about their jobs. 
We could promise them some security. 
Excuse me. 
I've reconsidered my position. 
I'll sign your statement. 
May I ask why the sudden change of heart? 
I don't necessarily agree with everything that is in the statement, but I do see the need to shield DOD of any possible controversy that could reflect back on my father. 
HAYES: Miles. 
Thank you. 
I want one thing in return. 
What's that? 
That Chloe be kept on and assigned to me. 
Why Chloe? 
I'm going to need considerable server access to compile my report for DOD. 
Chloe can help me finish it in half the time. 
There are other people who can do that job. 
I have a working relationship with Chloe. 
She's an asset that you cannot afford to lose. 
Do we have a deal? 
Yes. 
Good. 
All right. 
Evelyn Martin will be leaving the presidential retreat in a couple of minutes. 
It's time to get going. 
What about the girl? 
( sighs ) I'll take care of her. 
MAN ( over phone ): Wayne Palmer. 
I'm at my car. 
No one's around. 
We're on our way. 
Okay. 
I'm extremely uncomfortable sending the two of you off without protection. 
Aaron, we've been over this. 
If you leave the compound again, we're going to risk raising suspicion. 
I know it, sir, but I don't like it. 
Wayne. 
Well, this is a surprise. 
We didn't know you were coming. 
Are you here to see the president? 
No. 
Mr. Palmer came here 
to give me a memento from his brother. 
It's a service medal. 
Sorry, I just... 
I knew you and the president were going to be dealing with this crisis today, and I just... 
I don't want you people to feel obliged to see me. 
There would never, ever be any obligation on our part, Wayne, especially under the circumstances. 
I just want you to know how sorry I am. 
Your brother was one of the greatest men to ever occupy the office. 
And his loss, to all of us, can't be expressed in words. 
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. 
And I know that the president would also like to express his condolences to you personally. 
That means a lot, sir, but unfortunately I have a plane to catch. 
I'm, uh... flying David's body 
back to Washington, so... 
Oh, I understand. 
Safe trip. 
Thank you, sir. 
I'll walk you out, sir. 
Excuse me. 
( typing ) CHLOE: Mr. Buchanan. 
Miss O'Brian, we're not done here. 
How can they get away with this? 
Chloe, this is not over. 
Just follow your instructions. 
Oh, it sure seems over. 
Everyone's getting fired. 
I'm going to do everything I can to get that order rescinded. 
Once the details of what we accomplished here today are made public, I'm confident we'll be back at our posts. 
The best thing you can do is stay focused and follow your orders, do you understand me? 
Yes, sir. 
It's going to be all right. 
O'Brian, don't transfer your station to Valerie. 
You got a pass. 
I did? 
Yeah. So get back to work. 
I don't understand. 
Why am I staying and everybody else is being let go? 
Because Miss Raines requested that you keep your position. 
What has Audrey Raines have to do with this? 
Miss Raines signed a detailed statement documenting the numerous missteps made today by CTU. 
And by you in particular. 
So, for the moment, she gets what she wants, and she wants O'Brian. 
Audrey would never sign anything like that. 
AUDREY: I did sign it, Bill. 
Why? 
Because it's the truth. 
You realize this effectively kills any chance we have of rescinding that order. 
Yes, I know. 
I'm sorry. 
O' Brian. 
I got a call from a man about an hour ago who told me that he had my daughter. 
That if I wanted to see her alive again, that I would have to follow his exact instructions. 
Did he give you proof he had her? 
I talked to her. 
She sounded so scared. 
You told anybody else about this? 
I couldn't. He said that 
if I did, he would know. 
Evelyn, listen, I know we have a deal. 
And I'm going to do everything I can to get your daughter back. 
No, I told you before. 
I can't tell you anything until I have Amy back. 
You called David with this information. 
Why him? 
I knew him. 
He and the First Lady were friends. 
He was truly a wonderful man. 
Yes. 
Yes, he was. 
I still can't accept talking about him in the past tense. 
I just... 
I just can't believe he's gone. 
I told him this information because I trusted him. 
I never thought for a moment that it would endanger him. 
I have your brother's blood on my hands, and for that, I will never forgive myself. 
Evelyn, you did nothing wrong. 
( cell phone rings ) It's them. 
( speed dialing ) ( cell phone rings ) Bauer. 
Jack, the call's coming through. 
Patch me in. 
( Touch-Tone beeps ) You're ready for this? 
( phone beeps ) Hello. 
What took you so long to answer, Evelyn? 
I was just passing through security. 
I just left the retreat. 
HENDERSON: Are you alone? 
Yes. 
Why was Wayne Palmer at the retreat? 
Wayne Palmer? 
Please don't waste my time. 
He was there for a reason, and it wasn't to drop off his resume. 
I think he was there to speak with you. 
I didn't even know he was there. 
I don't believe you. 
I didn't see him. 
Evelyn, if you're lying to me, it's your daughter who will suffer. 
I'm telling you the truth. 
Please, you have to believe me. 
Did you bring what we discussed? 
Yes. 
Please, let me talk to Amy. 
Very well. 
All right, sweetheart, this is your mommy. 
Say hello. 
Mommy? 
It's me, honey. 
Are you okay? 
Uh-huh. Are you 
coming to get me now? 
Mommy's going to be there real soon. 
I want you to keep being brave. 
Okay? 
Promise me? 
I promise. 
I love you, my baby. 
I love you, too. 
Okay, that's enough, sweetheart. 
Very good. 
Now take down this address. 
4615 Tarpin Street. 
Got it? 
EVELYN: Yes, I've got it. 
( speed dialing ) ( cell phone rings ) Hello? 
Audrey, it's Jack. 
I just got off the call. 
It was Henderson. 
Have you got Chloe back on line? 
Audrey? 
Sorry, Jack. 
Yes, Chloe's still here. 
Okay, I'm going to give the address for the satellite sweep. 
All right, go ahead. 
4615 Tarpin. 
All right. 
Give me a few minutes. 
Chloe, I need you to come with me. 
Don't talk to me. 
It's for Jack. 
Jack? 
Chloe, Jack needs your help. 
Please. 
Fine. 
What the hell's going on? 
I had to keep Karen from replacing you. 
That's why I signed the document. 
I didn't have a choice. 
I don't understand. 
Chloe, you're the only one that Jack and I trust here. 
Jack needs one of the satellites retasked. 
Why? 
Here's the address. 
We need a full infrared sweep. 
I'm going to need an explanation. 
Chloe, I promise you, I will give you one, but right now we need to hurry. 
( vehicle approaching ) ( car door slams shut ) ( approaching footsteps ) Something's wrong. 
Wayne. 
Jack. 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
It's good to see you. 
Good to see you, too. 
Evelyn, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I promise you, we're going to get your daughter back. 
Right now I need to know what you know. 
I already told them I wouldn't give up any information until I have my daughter. 
Fine. 
Excuse me for one second. 
( dialing phone ) ( over phone ): Audrey Raines. 
Audrey, it's Jack. 
Let me speak to Chloe. 
Okay, Jack, hold on. 
Jack, you're on speaker. 
Jack, Audrey told me what's happening. 
I can't believe the vice president's involved in this. 
Yeah, I know. 
Where are we with the satellite? 
It's coming up now. 
I'm sending the image to your PDA. 
There are men all over the place. 
How many? 
I'm counting ten. 
Okay. I want you to keep 
the satellite on target. 
I want you to download real-time images to my PDA. 
CHLOE: Okay. 
Jack. 
I'm going to go with Evelyn in her car to make the exchange. 
I want you to find somewhere safe, and I want you to stay there until this is over. 
No, I'm going with you. 
I can't allow that. 
This is going to be extremely dangerous. 
I was a Marine, Jack. 
I know that, Wayne. 
And you never saw a combat. 
There's a big difference between training to kill someone and actually having to do it. 
I can't put you in harm's way out of respect to your brother. 
Your family needs you now. 
These are the people who killed my brother, Jack. 
They shot a bullet right through his neck, and then he died in my arms. 
Put yourself in my position. 
Could you just walk away? 
No. 
Neither can I. 
I'm coming with you, Jack. 
( laughing ) Thank you for your support, Mr. Prime Minister. 
Give my regards to your lovely wife. 
We'll talk soon. 
It's going to take me better part of the day to return all these phone calls. 
That's wonderful, Mr. President. 
World leaders, prominent Americans. 
They're all lining up to offer their congratulations. 
Uh, sir, were you aware that Wayne Palmer was on the premises? 
He was? 
Yes, I just spoke with him, not a half hour ago, he just left. 
You didn't speak with him? 
No. 
What was he doing here? 
Well, he said he had a memento from President Palmer he wanted to give to Aaron Pierce. 
It was a service medal. 
That explains it. 
David and Aaron were very close. 
I'm just surprised he didn't want to speak with you. 
Well, it's no secret that his brother and I had our share of disagreements over the years. 
It's possible Wayne harbors ill feelings towards me. 
That must be the reason. 
You clear on the plan? 
I don't think I can do this. 
Evelyn, do you want to see your little girl again? 
Because these men didn't hesitate to kill President Palmer and they're gonna hesitate to kill you and your daughter once they get what they want. 
Right now, I am your last chance. 
We have to stick to the plan, do you understand me? 
Okay, once you have your daughter in your arms... 
I know what to do. 
We are going to get her back. 
Let's go. 
( engine starts ) Call out testing one, two, three. 
Testing, one, two, three. 
Chloe, did you get that? 
You're coming through now. 
I'm refreshing your screen. 
Okay, we're at the southeast corner entrance. 
Jack, there's a tunnel through that door that leads to a conveyor belt that lets out into the middle of the plant. 
Be careful, there's a hostile at the exit. 
Copy that. 
Draw your weapon. 
Let's go. 
Bravo, check. 
Have you got a visual on the mark? 
Negative, sir. 
All units holding. 
Copy. 
This way. 
( silenced gunshots ) Let's go. 
Damn it, there's too many of them. 
We're running out of time. 
I'm gonna need you to take out one of their guards so I can climb to the top of this structure and take out the sniper. 
He's about a hundred yards north of here, just on the other side of the conveyor belt. 
Can you do that? 
Yeah. I can do it. 
Wait. One of them's moving. 
( silenced gunshots ) Go. 
Mr. Palmer, 
can you hear me? 
Copy. I'm on the south side 
of the lower belt moving west. 
Continue to the end, your target's to the north. 
( silenced gunshots ) Jack, it's all clear. 
( vehicle approaching ) This is Bravo. 
I think I hear a car. 
Vehicle headed north. 
Single occupant, female, over. 
HENDERSON: Bravo, what have you got? 
I repeat, Bravo, what have you got? 
Come in, Bravo. 
( garbled transmission ) Say again. 
I didn't get that. 
I repeat, woman is alone... 
( static hisses ): ...in the car. 
Copy. 
Chloe, we've taken out four men. 
Evelyn has moved into position. 
Wayne, I want you to wait for my signal. 
Copy. 
We need Henderson alive. 
Do not shoot to kill. 
( cell phone ringing ) Yes? 
Evelyn, open all the doors and the trunk of the car. 
Very good, Evelyn. 
Now go to the front of the car and drop the keys on the ground. 
I have the evidence with me. 
I want my daughter. 
Bravo, hold your position. 
I'm coming out. 
I have a visual on Henderson and the girl. 
Okay, Evelyn, give me the evidence. 
I'll give you the evidence once you give me Amy. 
Come on, let her go. 
Okay, honey, go see Mommy. 
Mommy! 
She's moving. 
Give me the evidence, Evelyn. 
Get down. Get down. 
Bravo, check. Come in. 
Bravo. Come in, Bravo. 
( gunfire ) ( screaming ) ( gunfire continues ) Wayne, I didn't get him. 
If you got a shot, take it. 
( engine starting ) ( grunting ) ( gunfire ) Chloe, it's Jack. 
Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car. 
Do you have him on satellite? 
We saw it, Jack, but he's leaving the search grid. 
We're thermal-scanning the plant, not the entire neighborhood. 
Well then reprogram it! 
We can't lose him! 
Is she all right? 
Evelyn's been hit. 
The bullet passed right through. 
It hasn't hit an artery. 
It's not serious, but it's gonna have to be dressed. 
Evelyn, you've got your daughter back, now tell me what I need to know. 
Who is behind this? 
Is it the vice president? 
Evelyn, is it the vice president? 
The vice president has nothing to do with this. 
You promised me you would control the situation. 
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir. 
He outmaneuvered me. 
Sir, Bauer and Wayne Palmer won't be around long enough to tell anybody else what they know. 
I'm putting together another team. 
I will handle this, sir, I promise you. 
I will not let you down. 
See that you don't. 
What's going on? 
What do you mean? 
I'm your brother. 
Whatever it is, you can tell me. 
It's all right, really. 
Okay. 
One more chapter and we'll take a break. 
( glass shattering ) David. 
Get help! 
Whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody by the time the Russians get here. 
BUCHANAN: I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, sir. 
No. Absolutely not. 
I think... that David was killed 
because of something he was about to tell me. 
He said that it concerned national security and that it involved you. 
Was she all right? 
No, Walt, she's not all right. 
She's having another one of her delusions. 
What is this, an interrogation? 
I just don't like being lied to. 
No one's lying to you, Derek. 
Yeah, I'm not hungry. 
Sorry. 
You don't owe me an explanation. 
If you had wanted to tell me about your past, you would have told me already. 
( cell phone ringing ) Yeah? 
Jack, I know this isn't protocol, please don't hang up on me, I need your help. 
They got Tony and Michele, Michele is dead, Tony's in critical condition, now they're gonna kill me. 
What the hell are you doing here? 
I'm sorry I followed you, I'm just... I'm just worried 
about my mother. 
You're going with me. 
( gunfire ) ( gunshot ) ( gunshots ) Hold your fire, Chloe! 
Palmer was my primary target. 
( coughing ): Set you up. 
Make it look like you did it. 
You're the one that killed Palmer. 
Yeah. 
( gunshot ) AUDREY: The President's retreat is still vulnerable. 
You need to post two more people here at Delta. 
It's a high probability point of infiltration. 
We'll have to pull assets from somewhere else. 
Yeah, Marcie, hi. 
Can you give me the figures? 
Excuse me, sir. 
Sorry to interrupt. 
What is it, Edgar? 
We have a visual on a suspect, I thought you might want to know. 
He may be the Palmer shooter. 
Were you able to make an ID? 
I think you should see for yourself. 
About an hour before President Palmer was shot... 
( typing ) ...someone broke into 
the service ance of the building across the street, the one the sniper used. 
We have a frame grab from a security video. 
I ran it through a high-res filter, so it may take a few seconds to render. 
Audrey. 
What is going on here, Jack? 
They're setting me up to take the fall for Palmer's assassination. 
Palmer's not even president anymore. 
Why would they want him dead? 
I don't know. 
You need to get as far away from here as you can. 
Just disappear. 
No, what I need to do is I need to find out who really killed President Palmer. 
How are you gonna do that? 
Start at the beginning. 
Investigate the original crime scene. 
David Palmer was visiting his brother when he was shot. 
Maybe he left something there that can help me. 
That's crazy. Palmer was 
assassinated an hour ago. 
The place is gonna be crawling with Secret Service, FBI, local police. 
I need access to a building schematic and an interagency deployment grid. 
Can you get that for me or not? 
Yeah. 
I should be able to log on remotely from the site. 
Okay. 
Come on, let's go. 
How could you kill that guy? 
I'm sorry you had to see that, Derek. 
Gein the van. 
I'm not going anywhere with you. 
You're gonna do exactly what I tell you until I pass you off to your mother. 
Let go of me. 
Let's get something straight, kid. 
The only reason you're still conscious is because I don't want to carry you. 
Now get in the van. 
EDGAR: Preliminary analysis indicates the video hasn't been doctored. 
Then Jack was in the building the sniper fired from at the same time President Palmer was assassinated. 
That's impossible. 
This whole thing is impossible. 
Bill, you were there when Jack was shot. 
He had not pulse, no vitals. 
And I have no idea how Jack staged his own death. 
But I understand his reasons. 
He was about to be handed over to the Chinese government to spend the rest of his life in prison. 
None of that explains why Jack would want to kill David Palmer. 
I had Curtis pull the phone logs. 
Palmer, Tony and Michelle were all talking to Jack right before he was supposedly killed. 
Our working theory is that they conspired to help Jack fake his own death. 
Now you're saying that Jack was behind the attack on Tony and Michelle, too? 
Why would Jack want to kill the people who helped him? 
CURTIS: Something may have happened and he stopped trusting them to keep his secret. 
Jack would never murder his friends. 
Audrey... 
I don't want to believe Jack did this, either. 
But right now, it's the best explanation for the evidence that we have. 
I'm sorry. 
The White House needs to know about this. 
Yeah, I'll call the President. 
CURTIS: Bill. 
What is it, Curtis? 
I had Adamson run a data recovery operation on Tony's phone records. 
They show Chloe was on those calls with President Palmer and Tony. 
Chloe knew Jack was alive? 
Apparently. 
We called her in an hour ago, she should have been here by now. 
EDGAR: I've been trying to call her on her cell, but she's not answering. 
I wanted to run a locate but Spencer talked me out of it. 
If anything happens to her it's your fault. 
Stop. 
Have Adamson track her cell we need to get to her before Jack does. 
Put out an interagency alert. 
Jack Bauer is now the prime suspect in President Palmer's assassination. 
Emphasize that he's a former agent, well-trained and should be considered extremely dangerous. 
CUMMINGS: Excuse me, sir. 
What is it, Walt? 
Mrs. Logan called again. 
I can't keep putting her off about this phone call with David Palmer. 
Why would David Palmer call my wife about a national security threat? 
That's what she says he wanted to talk to her about. 
A matter of national security. 
Maybe if I investigated the phone call? 
No, you need to stay focused on the Summit. 
I am, sir, which is why we can't risk having Mrs. Logan 
obsess about this phone call. 
Showing her the truth might help her get on with her responsibilities today. 
So what are you... 
what are you suggesting? 
Well, if David Palmer called her yesterday, our communications office will have a recording of their conversation. 
Get that for me. 
Yes, sir. 
And Walt. 
Thank you for doing this. 
( over intcom ): Mr. President, 
Audrey Raines is holding on line three. 
Ms. Raines, this 
is President Logan. 
You're also on with Walt Cummings. 
Sir, CTU has a suspect in the assassination of President Palmer. 
Good! 
Who is it? 
Ms. Raines? 
It's Jack Bauer, sir. 
Jack Bauer's dead. 
We've all been living under that assumption, sir. 
I don't understand. 
What makes you think it's Bauer? 
CTU has verified surveillance video placing Jack Bauer at the same time, in the same building as the sniper who killed President Palmer. 
Audrey, this is Walt Cummings. 
Let me get clear on this. 
Are you saying that Bauer shot David Palmer? 
We're proceeding under that assumption, yes. 
Why? For what possible reason? 
David Palmer might have known that Jack Bauer s alive, knowledge that he shared with three other CTU agents, all of whom have been targeted in the last hour. 
The man does have a histor of insubordination, irrational behavior, drug addiction. 
Jack Bauer has a history of great service to this country. 
How does thiaffect your threat assessment for the Summit? 
We're still recommending that you delay or reschedule until Jack Bauer's apprehended. 
Ms. Raines, you have a suspect. 
Find him. 
Yes, sir. 
Sir, President Suvarov arrives within the hour. 
Should we think about informing his security chief that he's a potential target? 
No. No. 
I-I want this information limited to those involved in the manhunt for Jack Bauer. 
Understood? 
Yes, sir. 
I found Haas. 
He and his men are all dead. 
How did this happen? 
I'm not sure. 
The last time I spoke to Haas was about to move on Bauer and the woman. 
Is there any sign of Bauer now? 
No. I'll dispatch 
a team and track him. 
We'll have him in 24 hours. 
No, let CTU find Bauer. 
Once they have him in custody, we'll take him out. 
You're not concerned Bauer will impede the operation? 
He won't have chance. 
We launch in less than an hour. 
All of their hardware's military spec. 
Fragmentation grenades, percussion grenades. 
Here's a comm unit we can use. 
Who are these people? 
( phone ringing ) Yeah? 
DIANE: Frank, will you please tell me what's going on? 
Diane, I know it's hard, but please try not to worry. 
Derek is fine. 
Where are you now? 
Um, I'm-I'm about a half hour outside of L.A. 
Just tell me where to meet you. 
I don't know yet. 
Just keep heading towards the city. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
Can I talk to him? 
Of course, yeah. 
It's your mother. 
Talk to her. 
Mom? 
Derek, are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm all right. 
Are you sure? 
Jack, we're about a block away. 
Say good-bye to your mother. 
I have to hang up now, Mom. 
Derek, I love you. 
Me, too. 
Give me the phone. 
Get to the back of the vehicle. 
Go! 
RADIO DISPATCHER: Unit 14, clear. 
WOMAN: While security agencies are remaining hushed, speculation begins to grow. 
We're told, though, that that speculation will not be addressed because the government says security right now is of utmost importance. 
Now, look behind me, you'll see the Los Angeles apartment building where President David Palmer was assassinated a little more than an hour ago. 
You can also see Americans of all ages have started to gather to mourn and pay their last respects to the beloved former president, who surprised many almost three years ago with his 11th-hour announcement that he would not be seeking a second term. 
All right, go on through. 
...cordoned off the area 
and security... 
Let her through. 
( inaudible police radio transmission ) We're clear. 
Go on up front. 
Hold the light on the bag. 
Can you get a wireless access point from down here? 
Yeah, I'm reading the agents' transponders. 
I can track their locations to within three feet. 
Jack, there are 167 agents in and around the location, 25 of them in Wayne Palmer's apartment alone. 
I know-- that's why we better hope that this is gonna be the last place they're gonna be looking for me. 
Testing one, two, testing one, two, three. 
Okay. 
This is field ops communation unit. 
All you need to do is put it in your ear and we're set to go. 
Derek, put out the light. 
Officer. 
I live in this building. 
I was told that... 
( inaudible ) What... 
Relax. 
He's really good at this. 
You sure he's okay? 
Yeah. 
I think. 
All right, do you copy? 
Yeah. 
( keyboard clacking ) CHLOE: Wayne Palmer's apartment is the penthouse. 
( bell dings ) I'm going up now. 
Jack, there are four agents waiting at the lobby. 
Hold off on going up if you can. 
( bell dings, door opens ) Too late. 
( bell dings ) This first room is a study. 
He told my mother and I if ahis name's Frank. 
Who is he, really? 
His name's Jack Bauer. 
Up until a year and a half ago, he worked for the government. 
Is that why we're in the building where the president was killed? 
Please don't ask me any more questions. 
C-Can't you at least tell me why he had to pretend he was someone else? 
Certain people thought the best way to cover up their mistakes was to get rid of Jack. 
You mean, kill him? 
Yes. 
Jack had to give up everything and everyone in his life, including his daughter. 
He has a daughter? 
I've already told you more than I should. 
JACK: I have the computer in the study booted up. 
President Palmer had a user account. 
Is it password-secured? 
No. There are about 
a dozen files; only one of them's encrypted. 
That's where I'm gonna look. 
Okay, give me the computer's IP address. 
I'll upload a decryption program to it. 
Hold on. 
292dot16 2-dot-1-2-dot-2. 
( door opening ) Someone's at the door. 
Not according to the deployment grid. 
There are no agents there. 
Do not move. 
Do not raise your voice. 
You son of a bitch. 
You killed my brother. 
Mr. Palmer, you know 
I didn't do that. 
Whatever evidence they showed you against me has been fabricated. 
I served your brother for years. 
I would've gladly given my life for his. 
He was my friend. 
The only reason that I ahere is to try and figure out why and how he was assassinated. 
I was hoping to find clues on that computer. 
Why don't you step into the next room, Jack, and ask the Secret Service to help you find it? 
Because I'm being set up. 
Whoever's behind this has planted evidence against me making me the shooter. 
It would be useless to try and convince the authorities otherwise. 
You think you're gonna convince me? 
If I killed your brother, why didn't I kill you when you walked through the door? 
Think about this, Wayne. 
Why would I be here? 
Please... I need your help. 
Jack, how do you expect me to believe you under these circumstances? 
Take the gun. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
Take the gun. 
MAN ( over TV ): That after two terms in the House and one in the Senate, he was elected president... 
There you are, Mrs. Logan. 
...recapturing for his party 
key states... 
David and I first got to know each other when he was elected to Congress. 
He and Charles never saw eye to eye politically, but... 
David never let that get in the way of our friendship. 
Oh... 
that picture's from his inauguration. 
At the ball, I was one of the first people David asked to dance. 
...and above all, honor! 
Mrs. Logan, I need 
a few more minutes with your hair... 
I know! I can do it myself. 
Just trying to help. 
Um, I'm sorry, Evelyn, I know. I'm sorry. 
Mrs. Logan... 
may I have a word? 
Of course. 
The president asked me to look into the call from David Palmer that you... 
told him about. 
I was beginning to think you were ignoring me. 
Oh. So when did this 
call take place? 
Last night. 
It woke me up. 
I had fallen asleep watching the news, so it was somewhere between 10:00 and 11:00. 
Well, I'll have someone pull up the call from the audio archives. 
PRESIDENT PALMER: ...very thing that will 
defeat our enemies... 
Walt. 
He doesn't believe me, does he? 
Charles. 
He thinks I'm making the whole thing up. 
( cheering over TV ) I wouldn't say that, Mrs. Logan. 
( laughs ): Well, of course you wouldn't say it. 
( sighs ): Mrs. Logan... 
Walt, you can go now. 
NEWSMAN: ...partially scarred 
and weakened. 
He leaves behind a son and daughter, as well as a shocked and grieving nation. 
David Palmer, dead today at age 55. 
Your brother say or do anything out of the ordinary before he was shot? 
He was acting distracted ever since he came to Los Angeles. 
I finally called him on it this morning. 
What'd he say? 
He never had the chance to say anything, Jack. 
Yeah. 
The decryption program's finished running. 
You should be able to open the file. 
Okay, I'm going into it now. 
( keyboard clacking ) WAYNE: That's the first chapter of his memoir. 
That doesn't make any sense why would he encrypt that? 
I mean, there are printouts of it all over the place. 
Maybe he hid some information in the document. 
We're gonna have to compare this to the printout, see if he added or changed anything. 
Got one right here. 
You haven't sent the file allocations; whas the problem? 
I need a higher vel access code. 
Look, if you're still upset about me and Chloe... 
I don't care about that. 
I care that if you hadn't left her on her own this morning, maybe she'd be okay right now. 
Don't you think I know that? 
Look, you're just making it harder for me to do my job. 
Use Chloe's access code: JJ72. 
You won't get fire-walled with it. 
Thank you. 
Edgar. 
What? 
This is weird. 
I tried logging in under Chloe's access code the system says I'm already signed in. 
Let me see... 
( typing ) That's because Chloe's logged in, remotely. 
Are you sure it's her? 
Yes-- see the way the traffic's redirected through an external socket? 
Even I don't know how to do that. 
( sighing ): Then she's alive. 
( phone ringing ) Buchanan. 
Sir, it's Edgar. 
I think we can find Chloe. 
How? 
She's accessing our system through a laptop. 
I'm running a locate now. 
What's she using our system to do? 
EDGAR: All I can see from here is she's tracking Secret Service and FBI deployments. 
The locate came back. 
She's at Wayne Palmer's building. 
The signal's faint. 
It's possible she's in t parking garage under the building. 
Let me know if she changes location. 
Why would Chloe be at the scene of Palmer's assassination, tracking agents? 
She wouldn't be... 
unless someone was forcing her. 
What do you mean? 
Maybe Jack left evidence behind he needs to erase. 
Surrounded by all of those agents? 
Bill, that doesn't make sense. 
Jack can explain it to us when we apprehend him. 
This is Bill Buchanan at CTU. 
I need to speak to Yes. 
Have you left yet? 
No, we were delayed. 
We're still loading the truck. 
You should be on your way by now. 
Be there in 20 minutes, as planned. 
Call me when you're approaching. 
Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop... 
Right there-- he added something in the middle of a sentence: a name and an address. 
There. 
JACK: "Chevensky - 16 Transport Way." 
Chloe, did you get that? 
It looks like an address. 
Yes. Transport Way is a street 
at the Ontario airport. 
Okay, I want you to check all inbound flights into Ontario. 
Look for a passenger Chevensky. 
Try and make the connection. 
Jack, the Secret Service is changing its deployment. 
JACK: How? 
CHLOE: Suddenly, there are a lot of agents moving into the building. 
I'm on my way down. 
They know that I'm here. 
Let me help you get out of here, Jack. 
No. 
You can't risk being connected to me. 
And until we know who to trust, you can't tell anybody about what we found, do you understand? 
I'm going to do everything I can to find out who did this to your brother. 
I'll be in touch. 
Chloe, I need another way out of here. 
Checking. 
Jack, across the hall, through the kitchen. 
One agent at the door. 
Copy that. 
( bell dings ) I'm in the elevator. 
Where are they concentrating their agents? 
Jack, they cut off accesso my grid; I don't know where the agents are. 
They were grouping in the lobby. 
( bell dings ) I'm getting out on the second floor. 
Come on, Jack. 
What'd you get for me on Chevensky? 
He's not a passenger, he's a baggage supervisor at the airport. 
AGENT JENNINGS: Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian! 
The perimeter is sealed! 
There is no way out! 
Step into view with your hands in the air! 
We know you're down here! 
Step into view with your hands in the air! 
Do not shoot! 
We need them alive! 
JENNINGS: No one fire! 
No one fire! 
JENNINGS: Do not fire! 
Step out of the vehicle! 
Check the back! 
Get the side! 
Step to your left! 
Get down on your knees! 
Cuff her! 
Open the back! 
Back. 
Clear. 
JENNINGS: Bauer's not here. 
Secure the area. 
JACK: Get in! Give me my bag! 
Come on... 
Got it. 
( phone auto-dialing ) ( phone ringing ) Frank. 
Yeah, it's me. 
Listen, Derek is all right. 
I just need to know where you are. 
I'm on the 210 at the 10. 
Okay, I want you to take the 10 East to the Ontario Airport. 
When you get there, I want you to go to the parking lot in front of the terminal. 
I'll meet you on the west side of that parking lot. 
Do you understand me? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Diane, listen to me. 
I am so sorry that I got you involved in this. 
But everything's gonna be all right. 
I'll be there in a few minutes, okay? 
Okay. 
Okay. Thanks. 
Mr. Buchanan, this 
is Agent Jennings. 
There's no sign of Jack Bauer yet, but we've apprehended your agent, Chloe O'Brian. 
She was trying to escape our agents and get away from the building. 
You're telling me she wasn't under duress? 
Not as far as I can tell. 
Put her on the phone. 
Uncuff her. 
Bill Buchanan wants to talk to you. 
Hi. 
Chloe, what the hell's going on? 
Jack didn't kill anybody. 
He's being framed to cover up the real reason Palmer was assassinated. 
This is according to Jack. 
This is according to the man who killed Palmer. 
I heard his dying confession. 
You'll find his body at the refinery, just north of the city, at Variel and Topanga. 
Chloe, do you have evidence that Palmer's assassination has anything to do with the summit? 
No. Jack's trying to 
figure all that out. 
BUCHANAN: How? Where is he? 
I can't tell you. 
Why not? 
Because I don't think you believe him. 
I think you're just trying to arrest him. 
Chloe, I'm not going to ask you again. 
I'm ordering you to tell me where Jack is. 
I'm sorry; I'd like to tell you, but I can't. 
Chloe! 
JENNINGS: Sir? 
Bring her back to CTU. 
Curtis, take a team to the refinery. 
See what you can find there. 
Edgar, make sure Chloe goes into a holding cell when she gets back. 
That woman, Chloe... 
she told me some stuff about what you used to do. 
( ghs ) Yeah, well, she shouldn't have. 
Why did you have to lie? 
Couldn't you have just told us the truth? 
First of all, Derek, you have to understand that I never thought anything like this could ever happen. 
After your mother rented me that room, I started to remember what it was like to have a family. 
( gentle laugh ) How nice it was. 
I started to believe that a guy like me could actually get a second chance. 
I know you don't believe this now... 
but I really do care about you. 
And I care about your mother. 
I hope, one day, you can understand that. 
MARTHA: Charles? 
Evelyn said you wanted to talk to me? 
I do. 
Did Walt find the tape of the phone call? 
I told him approximately when it took place. 
Why don't we sit down? 
No. I don't want to sit down. 
All right. 
You don't need to be concerned that there's any connection between David's death and the phone call that he made to you. 
He said it was a matter of national security. 
Those were his exact words. 
There's got to be a connection, of course. 
There isn't. 
David was killed by an unstable ex-CTU agent. 
This was not a conspiracy. 
This was one man acting out some kind of grudge. 
Did you hear the call? 
Marty, can we just drop this? 
Did you or didn't you hear it?! 
Martha, it's David Palmer. 
Did I wake you? 
MARTHA: No, no, David, not at all. 
What's going on? 
I need to talk to you. 
It's hardly a matter of national security, but I'm hosting a charity nner next month for the Art in Action Scholarship Program. 
That sounds wonderful. 
No. That's not what he said. 
I would very much like you No. That's not 
what he said. 
and the President to be there. 
Okay, David. 
No, that is not it. 
That is not it, Charles. 
That's not it. 
Thanks so much for calling. 
Let me... 
Martha, listen! 
Thank you, Martha. 
Of course. 
Please send the president my best. 
No, that's not... 
that's not what he said. 
Yes, it is. 
No, that is... 
that is a trick. 
Listen to me... 
I am not crazy. 
Marty... Martha! 
I know what I heard! 
I know what I heard. 
I spoke to Dr. Hill. 
He said if you were not consistent with your medication, you could become disoriented. 
Your memory can be affected. 
He said that? 
Yes! 
That's why you remember something different. 
I know you don't like how these pills make you feel, but you need to take them. 
( sighs ) If Jack was responsible for President Palmer's assassination, why would Chloe cover for him? 
It just doesn't make sense. 
There's something else going on here, and we're missing it. 
NSA just intercepted some chatter identifying the summit as a target. 
We're sourcing it now, but the reliability is approaching 95%. 
Is there a timeframe? 
Within the next 15 minutes. 
That's when the Russian president is scheduled to land. 
President Logan said he will not postpone this summit. 
In light of this, he may not have a choice. 
Put me through to Mike Novick. 
NATHANSON: I'm watching Suvarov's helicopter leave the airbase. 
His arrival at the retreat is on schedule. 
As are we. 
We'll go dark now. 
No communication until after you strike. 
I will monitor yourrogress from here. 
Understood. 
( speaking foreign language ) Mr. President? 
Yeah, Mike, what is it? 
CTU has confirmed intelligence suggesting President Suvarov's helicopter will be targeted. 
How good is this intelligence? 
Very good. They're updating 
their recommendation that you delay or reschedule. 
No. I've told them, 
I'm telling you. 
I will not postpone this summit! 
Then at least have Suvarov alter his arrival plan. 
His chopper can land at a different site and he can be brought here by motorcade. 
The risk would be substantially reduced. 
And the impact of his arrival would also be reduced. 
I've got the media waiting for a landing five minutes from now! 
Mr. President... 
I don't want to hear it, Walt. 
It's up to Secret Service and the Air Force to protect our airspace! 
Make sure they do the job. 
There's your mom. 
Hey. 
I'm sorry about the way I treated you earlier. 
You're a good kid. 
Go get your mom. 
Mom?! 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, are you okay? 
I was so worried! 
I'm sorry. 
You got to tell me right now what the hell is going on here, Frank. 
My name's not Frank. 
It's Jack Bauer. 
I lied to you. 
I lied to you about a lot of things. 
I'll explain as soon as I can, but right now, you and Derek need to go to this address. 
"CTU"? 
Counterterrorist Unit. 
I used to work there. 
You need to ask for a man named Bill Buchanan. 
Tell him I sent you. 
I'm sorry. 
I have to go. 
When we get there, what do we tell him? 
Tell him the truth. 
Where can I find the Baggage Claim Supervisor? 
Down that hall to the left. 
Thank you. 
DOD is still giving us the all clear on the air space and the retreat. 
Any word from our agents on the ground? 
Okay. 
I'm all quiet so far. 
But if they're going to attack the helicopter, it's going to be now. 
Hi, Mr. President... 
Our intel must have been wrong. 
Mom, do you see those men? 
Yeah. 
That's where Jack went. 
Something's wrong. 
I have to tell Jack. 
Derek, where are you going? 
Come back here! 
Derek! Come back here! 
Derek! 
Come back here! 
Wait! Excuse me! 
I've got to get my son! 
No! You... 
Get off! 
You can't... 
Please move your car. 
I've got to get my son. 
Derek! 
Get back in! 
Chevensky! 
Why was President Palmer killed?! 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
( grunting ) You are going to tell me what I want to know. 
It's just a question of how much you want it to hurt. 
( gasps ) No! 
( screaming ) ( automatic gunfire continues ) ( screaming continues ) Quiet! 
Quiet! 
( screaming stops ) You will not be harmed as long as your president complies with our wishes. 
Derek! 
Derek! 
Ma'am, stop! 
I have to get my son! 
You need to go the other way. 
My son! 
Go the other way. 
This is a dangerous situation. 
I have to get my son! 
CUMMINGS: I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation. 
She's not going to be a problem? 
No. I was able to alter 
the tape of the phone call before the president heard it. 
There's no longer any evidence on my end that Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack. 
Good. 
The terminal and the hostages are secure. 
It'll only be a matter of time until the president is notified of the demands. 
All right. 
Evelyn, I need you to stay focused. 
The recording of the phone call that you made between President Logan and Henderson is in a safety deposit box. 
Which bank? 
City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills. 
Jack knows there's no point in going public till he has that evidence in his hand. 
None of this should have happened. 
This whole thing was planned to make our country safer. 
and it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer. 
We have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording. 
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer. 
I want you to run point on this and I want you to make this CTU's top priority. 
Understood, sir. 
You know, if we really want to find Bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help, starting with Audrey Raines. 
Don't fill your father in on the particulars. 
Just set up the meeting. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording. 
I need to see you in person. 
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles? 
All right, yes. 
I'll see you there. 
Jack, are you aware President Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest? 
The vice president's not the one who's behind this, is he? 
No. It's Logan. 
As soon as we have the evidence in hand, we're going to pass it off to Secretary of Defense Heller. 
HENDERSON: It had to be done, sir. 
LOGAN: I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson. 
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 
You know what we need. 
The instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building, you take him down. 
Kill the others and secure the recording. 
( gunfire ) ( gunfire ) ( gunfire ) ( bullets hitting metal ) ( machine gun fire ) We got the evidence. 
Have you listened to it? 
Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan. 
We're talking about taking down the president of the United States. 
This checkpoint is just one of many that have been in place for several hours now. 
Despite his announcement that Los Angeles is no longer under threat of attack, President Logan has ordered that martial law remain in effect. 
While the move has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil rights advocates, the president is defending his decision as a necessary precaution. 
( phone ringing ) He's citing the need... 
( mutes TV ) Yes. 
HENDERSON: It's me. 
Is Bauer dead? 
Not yet, Mr. President. 
You said your men had him. 
Bauer triggered the bank alarm. 
The authorities came before our men could get to him. 
Bauer used the cover of the firefight to slip away. 
He has the recording? 
Yes, sir. 
That evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death. 
Only if he gets it to someone who can do something about it. 
We'll have Bauer before that happens. 
How? 
Mr. President, 
you've established direct control over CTU, and CTU is heading up the search effort for Bauer. 
You're putting an awful lot of faith in their ability. 
This city is locked down. 
CTU will find Bauer, and when they do, make sure you're the first to know so my men can intercept. 
( intercom beeps ) Yes, Mr. President? 
Karen Hayes at CTU. 
Put it through to my office. 
We're sifting satellite and CalTrans video for Audrey Raines's vehicle. 
I've distributed her file photo to military checkpoints throughout the city. 
If she used her DoD credentials at any of them, there should be a record. 
Well, I hope we're not wasting our resources on Raines when we don't even know she's helping Bauer. 
Karen, she dumped the tracker. 
There's a reason she doesn't want to be followed. 
( intercom beeping ) MAN: Miss Hayes, the president's on line one. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Where are we, Ms. Hayes? 
Still running active manhunts on both Jack Bauer and Christopher Henderson. 
I told you to prioritize Bauer. 
I have, sir. 
I've allocated my resources accordingly. 
If David Palmer's killer is still at large when the morning news cycle begins, then all the success we've had handling these terrorists will be undermined. 
I will find Bauer, sir. 
You let me know the moment you do. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Bauer, right? 
Audrey Raines. 
She knows where he is, and those protocols aren't going to be enough to track her. 
You still think Chloe helped Audrey break surveillance? 
I'm sure of it. 
Remember, Audrey insisted Chloe be assigned to her. 
Then we need to confront Chloe. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
She'll just deny it. 
There's a way we can use her to find Bauer. 
It's all right. It's him. 
JACK: Bill, over here. 
Jack. 
Bill Buchanan, Wayne Palmer. 
Sorry about your brother. 
What the hell's going on, Jack? 
The military authority, every law enforcement agency across this country has a warrant for my arrest. 
What for? 
Killing David Palmer. 
That's impossible. 
We cleared you this morning. 
I'm being set up again, this time by President Logan. 
He was complicit in David Palmer's assassination. 
My God, you're serious. 
Logan's using the military to try and stop me from exposing him. 
Mr. Buchanan, we 
have the evidence: a digital recording of a conversation made between President Logan and Christopher Henderson. 
I need to get the recording to Secretary Heller. 
He's gonna take it to the Attorney General, and they'll file for the warrant. 
But until then, Wayne's a target. 
I need you to take him somewhere safe. 
Of course I will. 
Where are you gonna meet Heller? 
Van Nuys Airport. 
( engine starts ) JACK: Yeah. 
Jack, my father landed. 
Where are you? 
I just dropped Wayne Palmer off with Buchanan. 
I'm on my way to the airport now. 
All right, I'm on the north side of the emergency runway at hangar 112. 
I'll be there in a few minutes. 
All right, hurry. 
Dad. 
Hi, sweetheart. 
Hi. 
Thank you so much for doing this. 
Well, I don't know what it is I'm doing, so don't thank me yet. 
These men in your security detail, do you trust them? 
With my life. 
Dad, I need to be sure that they are loyal to you. 
What's going on? 
( car approaches ) Dad, I will tell you, but only you. 
Stay here. 
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark. 
Tell me what this is all about. 
I promise, I will. 
I just need a minute. 
Mr. Secretary. 
What the hell are you doing here? 
He's a fugitive. 
Every law enforcement agency in this state is looking for him. 
He's innocent. 
Then why don't you turn yourself in? 
Mr. Secretary, I swear to you, 
I had nothing to do with David Palmer's assassination. 
I'd like to believe you, Jack, but you're acting like a criminal. 
I don't have a choice; they're setting me up. 
Mr. Secretary, I only need you 
for a few minutes. 
I need to show you something, but privately, inside the building, please. 
Thank you, sir. 
HENDERSON: It had to be done, sir. 
LOGAN: I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson. 
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer. 
HENDERSON: Palmer was nosing around. 
President Logan? 
And a man named Christopher Henderson. 
HENDERSON: He'd have found out about your involvement. 
For God's sake, sir, he called your wife. 
LOGAN: I can handle my wife. 
Right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards. 
HENDERSON: You're protected, sir. 
Every thread ends with Cummings. 
He thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way. 
LOGAN: I know my part, Mr. Henderson. 
You just do as you're told. 
( recording clicks off ) JACK: President Logan supplied the terrorists with the Sentox nerve gas. 
What? 
His plan was to deploy the nerve gas en route to Moscow. 
That way, he could expose the terrorists and use them as an excuse to invoke the military terms of the agreement that he made earlier with Suvarov. 
This was all in an effort to gain control of the oil supply in Central Asia. 
David Palmer found out about it, and that's why they killed him. 
How do you know that recording hasn't been fabricated? 
I trust the source. 
Mr. Secretary, I promise you, 
this will stand up under scrutiny. 
I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not. 
I watched Charles Logan rise on the tide of his own ambition. 
I was terrified when he took the oath. 
Sir, I'm very sorry that I had to involve you, but I needed someone who had access to hand-deliver this to the Attorney General. 
So you contacted me. 
You're the only one I could trust. 
All right, then. 
Thank you, sir. 
You need to go with your father. 
He's going to need someone to corroborate the evidence to the Attorney General. 
What about you? 
I'm going to go dark until the Attorney General comes forward. 
I'll call Buchanan; I'll let him know what's happening. 
All right. Jack, 
everything's going to be okay now. 
Yeah. Go. 
Okay. 
Jack, one more thing. 
What, sir? 
( grunts ) Dad, what are you doing?! 
Secure my daughter. 
You're playing a dangerous game here, Jack, and you're playing it wrong. 
Turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle will not bring back David Palmer. 
It'll tear this nation apart. 
You're not only destroying the president, you'll be destroying the presidency. 
The collateral damage of the truth will cripple this nation. 
So what are you going to do? 
Bury the evidence? 
No. 
You're coming with me, Audrey, and we'll use the evidence to get Logan to step down quietly. 
Once he's gone, we'll have a chance to set things right again. 
Doug, I'm trusting you to keep this item safe. 
Audrey, are you coming with me or not? 
Dad, I can't. 
Then secure them both until you hear from me. 
Dad, please, no! 
Mr. Secretary, 
you can't make a deal with him! 
Do you know what's going on in the Situation Room? 
It's some sort of briefing. 
No one told me. 
It's a Class 3. 
That's all I know. 
I'm a department head. 
I should be in all Class 3s. 
That's all I know. 
Shari, what was that briefing about? 
Just a protocol review. 
I don't believe you. 
Why not? 
'Cause you're a bad liar. 
Miles just gave me a bunch of busywork to do in the Archives Room to keep me out of the briefing. 
Do you ever think there might be a reason he kept you out? 
He thinks I helped Audrey break her surveillance. 
Is that what it was about? 
I've already said too much. 
Please don't ask me any more questions. 
Come on, Shari, you owe me. 
I stuck my neck out for you with Miles. 
Tell me what happened in there. 
Miles found Audrey. 
He activated a transponder on her car. 
So they know where she is? 
We're running an operational support right now. 
That's what the briefing was about. 
They sent a tac team ten minutes ago. 
Please don't tell anyone I said anything. 
Here she comes. 
( phone ringing ) Damn, she's good. 
She set up a proprietary com channel. 
How long will it take to track her call? 
Not long. 
Pick up. 
( line continues ringing ) Somewhere in the Valley. 
Looks like a pay phone. 
I've got the receiving end narrowed down to a one-mile radius. 
Why isn't Audrey picking up? 
MILES: Narrowing... 
Got it. 
Where? 
Van Nuys Airport the emergency runway adjacent to the main field. 
Move the tac team out now. 
Van Nuys Airport. 
Miles is forwarding the coordinates. 
Get me the president. 
You said they sent the tac team ten minutes ago. 
Miles set me up, and you helped. 
You're working against us, Chloe. 
You have no idea what you've done. 
Miles said that... 
Miles is an idiot. 
If anyone should know that, it should be you. 
I can't believe you went along with him. 
Please come with us, Ms. O'Brian. 
Where are we going? 
Let's go. 
Mr. President, I need to remind 
you that we still don't have confirmation that Audrey Raines and Bauer are at the location. 
You'll find out soon enough. 
I'll have the military authority follow up on it. 
The military? 
Sir, I just dispatched my tac team. 
Call them back. 
I don't understand... 
Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem. 
There are political ramifications. 
I've decided to handle him directly. 
And besides, you must have your hands full, transitioning CTU to Homeland Security. 
I'll recall my team, sir. 
Good. 
Now the president wants oversight on the Bauer operation. 
MILES: He's the president. 
He can do what he wants. 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
CTU thinks they found Bauer. 
Where? 
Jack, what if my father's right? 
What if he can get Logan to step down quietly? 
Maybe that is the best thing for this country. 
These people brokered chemical weapons to terrorists. 
They've killed an ex-president of the United States. 
Logan's not going to make a deal with your father, and even if he did, he wouldn't keep it. 
Henderson wouldn't let him. 
The only thing your father's doing right now is making himself a target. 
You want to help him? 
Help me get the recording back before he speaks to Logan. 
Look, Mike, this isn't me being territorial, but if the president wants Jack Bauer, why doesn't he let us take care of it? 
Now, look, I've been on other things. 
Let me find out what's going on. 
I'll get back to you, Karen. 
Thank you, Mike. 
...Will be lifted 
within the next two hours, but the curfew will remain in effect... 
( knocking ) HAL: Come in. 
That's only six hours from now. 
Okay. 
David Palmer's body's being flown back to DC at 7:00 a.m. 
The president and I both want to be there when the coffin's put onto the plane. 
That's a good idea. 
Yeah. 
What's up, Mike? 
I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU. 
Do you know about the president's decision to pull them off the acquisition of Jack Bauer? 
No, but what's the problem? 
The problem is it doesn't really make sense. 
Karen's teams are closer. 
They can do it more efficiently. 
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them than with a group of military police he doesn't know. 
Well, Karen and her team have barely gotten CTU back on its feet. 
I'm sure the president just feels more confident with the military units already in place because of martial law. 
Well, the military has its hands full, Hal. 
What do you want me to say, Mike? 
It's the president's call. 
I can see it both ways. 
( phone rings ) Yeah? 
WOMAN: Operations. 
Beth, it's Mike Novick. 
Put me through to General Warren, please. 
Yes, sir. 
( phone rings ) This is Warren. 
BETH: Sir, I have Mike Novick on the line for you. 
Go ahead, Beth. 
BETH: He's on. 
What is it, Mike? 
General, can you give me an update on your search for Jack Bauer? 
What are you talking about? 
The one the president ordered. 
We never received such a call from the president. 
I see. 
I-I'm sorry to disturb you, General. 
You should try to get some rest, Mr. President. 
Yes, I know. 
I should try to get some rest. 
What is it you want, Mike? 
I just got off the phone with General Warren, who's running military operations here in Los Angeles. 
Why would you be talking with him? 
Karen Hayes over at Homeland raised a few good points I thought I'd follow up on. 
What good points, Mike? 
She doesn't understand why she was taken out of the loop on this Jack Bauer situation. 
You know, I really don't care what Karen Hayes understands. 
She should be doing her job and not bothering my advisors, asking questions that diminish my authority. 
Be that as it may, I did follow up, and, uh, now, frankly, I'm a little mystified by some things. 
What things mystify you, Mike? 
Well, you told Homeland that you wanted the military to pick up Jack Bauer, but I just spoke with General Warren, and he's unaware of any such directive. 
Because I didn't go through General Warren. 
May I ask who you did go through? 
Mike, let's get one thing straight: I don't answer to you. 
Of course not, sir. 
However, I will tell you this: I-I have decided to use a covert task force to bring in Jack Bauer. 
The reason I'm doing that is because Bauer presents... 
special circumstances. 
Special circumstances? 
I want this completely off the radar, Mike. 
The Chinese government may still believe that Jack Bauer is dead. 
If they find out that he's alive, they're going to blame us. 
They're going to, uh, accuse us of fabricating the story of his death. 
Um, wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller if we let Karen handle this? 
Her people already know about Bauer. 
They're working under a secretive mandate. 
You know what, Mike? 
I am tired of being second-guessed. 
I've been dealing with-with-with... 
wall-to-wall crises for the last 18 hours, and I think I've done a pretty damn good job of leading the country. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
You came in here suggesting that I should get some rest. 
That's the one recommendation of yours that I intend to take. 
Thank you, Mike. 
to a public phone at Van Nuys Airport. 
If Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble. 
Miles, this situation is more complicated than you think. 
You have no idea what you're dealing with. 
But you do. 
Yes. 
Then why didn't you tell me? 
Because I can't. 
You think the rules don't apply to you because you're smarter than the rest of us, but I have news for you. 
They do, and you're not. 
I won't miss you when you're gone. 
Miles. 
Don't touch me. 
What? 
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer. 
He's a Federal fugitive wanted for the murder of a former president, which means you're going to jail, O'Brian. 
For a long time. 
Miles. 
I don't think you're as big of a jerk as you pretend to be. 
I need to speak to you. 
Yes, sir. 
No, sir, I've been there the whole time. 
What are you doing, Chloe? 
You're supposed to be in custody. 
Miles let me out. 
You're a worse liar than I am. 
Shari, don't do that. 
You helped Audrey Raines break surveillance. 
Yes, I did it for a good reason. 
I can't get into it right now. 
Well, I don't really think you have a choice. 
Listen to me for a minute. 
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer. 
He knows who did it. 
He may need my help to prove it and I can't help him if I'm in custody. 
Then why don't you just tell Karen? 
Because she won't believe me. 
Nobody will, not without evidence. 
It's President Logan. 
What are you talking about? 
The evidence Jack is trying to get implicates Logan in the assassination of Palmer. 
That's ridiculous, Chloe. 
You know your sexual harassment charges against Miles? 
I know you were lying. 
You're sick and you need help, and if you try to stop me and it turns out I'm right about Jack, and I am, I will recommend you for a psychiatric evaluation. 
And you won't like that, trust me. 
MARTHA: Charles. 
You coming to bed soon? 
I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight. 
You should try. 
Yeah. 
You okay? 
I'm fine. 
It's just, uh... 
It's been a challenging day. 
Okay. 
Come to bed. 
I will. Soon. 
( phone ringing ) Yes? 
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. President, 
but Secretary Heller is on the line. 
He insists on talking to you. 
Tell him I'll call him back tomorrow. 
He says it's urgent, sir. 
Put him through. 
Yes, James. 
Thanks for taking my call, Mr. President. 
You said it was urgent. 
I need to see you, sir. 
See me about what? 
I'd rather speak to you in person. 
Fine, but I won't be back to Washington for a couple of days. 
I'm in L.A., sir. 
I need to see you tonight. 
Tonight? What is this about? 
I'll be there shortly and we can discuss it then. 
I don't like your tone, James. 
In case you've forgotten, you're addressing the President of the United States. 
I know who I'm addressing. 
And I think you know exactly what this is about. 
When will you be here? 
Five minutes. 
Fine. 
James Heller? What does he want? 
He's getting flak from the Joint Chiefs about my decision to maintain martial law. 
You would think that these people would show some allegiance. 
Can't James handle it himself? 
Apparently not. 
Come to bed when you're done. 
I will. 
( speed-dialing ) ( phone ringing ) We're leaving now. 
How long will it take you to get there? 
Ten minutes. 
We may not have that much time. 
James Heller is on his way here. 
He insisted on seeing me right away. 
Jack got to him. 
What if Bauer's given him the recording? 
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with him, and without it, whatever he knows or whatever he thinks he knows won't matter. 
You think Bauer still has it? 
I'm sure of it. 
I'll hold Heller off as long as I can, but you phone me the second you have the evidence in hand. 
Right. 
What is Secretary Heller doing here? 
I don't know, ma'am. 
But you have an idea. 
My husband says it's about his order to maintain martial law, but I think it's something else. 
If you know what it is, will you please tell me? 
I can't. 
You can't? 
Or you won't? 
Please don't ask me anything more, Mrs. Logan. 
Whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us. 
I promise you. 
Aaron... 
you can trust me. 
You know that. 
Not here. 
Meet me in a couple minutes. 
Where? 
Outside the south stable. 
James. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
I hope this was important. 
I know what you did. 
I know what you're doing. 
And I'm here to put an end to it. 
You have to be a little more specific. 
You are responsible for the murder of David Palmer. 
That's outrageous. 
I heard a recording a conversation between you and man named Christopher Henderson. 
When Palmer found out about your insane plan, Henderson had him killed. 
And you let it happen. 
Where is this recording? 
It's in a safe place. 
I would like to hear it. 
Why? 
You know exactly what you said, and so do I. 
It's burnt into my memory. 
How dare you stand there and judge me? 
You have no idea. 
Until you sit in my chair, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. 
Your chair is not a throne, Charles. 
I'm protecting the interests of our country. 
You mean oil. 
Yes. 
Yes! 
This country needs energy more than you or anybody in this gridlocked government cares to admit. 
We'll see how you judge me when the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel and the people who put me in office can't afford to heat their homes or run their cars. 
And you think that justifies the blood on your hands? 
What do you want? 
I want you to drop the trumped-up charges against Jack Bauer. 
And leave my daughter alone. 
Anything else? 
Announce your resignation by tomorrow morning. 
Blame it on the crushing stress of today's events, or blame it on whatever you want, just as long as you go public by the start of the morning news cycle. 
And then what? 
The recording will be kept under lock and key, and this will remain between us. 
Call in Vice President Gardner. 
I want to be here when you hand him your letter of resignation. 
Get in here. 
I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey. 
I haven't talked to them either. 
CTU might have them in custody. 
I need to tap into their current protocols. 
Where's your workstation? 
This way. 
Homeland changed my access code. 
I can create a workaround. 
If CTU has Jack, it's all my fault. 
( beeping ) ( phone rings ) ( grunts ) I can get us out of here. 
Watch the door. 
( grunts ) He's got restraints in his pocket. 
Wexler, status report. 
Mark, come in. 
Don't move. 
Don't... move. 
Slowly put the gun on the ground and kick it towards me. 
Do it! 
Put your hands where I can see them. 
Give me the recording. 
Slowly. 
Stand up. 
What did you do to my partner? 
He's fine. 
Son of a bitch! 
Take cover behind the wheel! Now! Move! 
Move! 
What the hell's going on?! 
They've come for the recording! 
If you and I are gonna get through this alive, we need to work together. 
Give me my gun! 
( grunts ) ( grunts ) ( gunfire continues ) ( explosion ) Audrey? 
HENDERSON: I have her, Jack. 
Now don't make me kill her. 
There's been too much killing today already, so just throw out that recording. 
Let her go, Christopher. 
After I have the recording. 
Why are you doing this? 
Why are you protecting Logan? 
I'm protecting something much more important than Charles Logan. 
What? 
The integrity of our government. 
Our government has no integrity. 
Not when someone like Charles Logan occupies the Presidency. 
Christopher, you can make this right. 
You can help me stop him. 
Sorry, Jack. 
Now throw me the recording. 
I'll give you the recording if you let Audrey go. 
I wish I could believe that. 
I give you my word. 
I'll tell you what. 
I'll meet you halfway. 
What does that mean? 
( muffled groaning ) Get up. 
Audrey? 
Just hold still, Ms. Raines. 
( muffled screams ) Damn it, Christopher! 
Here she comes, Jack. 
Walk out slow, or I'll kill you. 
Audrey. 
( panting ) HENDERSON: That's far enough, Ms. Raines. 
What have you done to her? 
The left brachial artery. 
She has about three minutes before she bleeds to death. 
Now throw me that recording. 
Jack, don't. 
HENDERSON: She's 15 seconds closer to dying, Jack. 
Give me the recording. 
Jack, don't do it. 
HENDERSON: She's running out of time. 
Don't do it, Jack. 
Don't. Don't 
give it to him. 
Here it is! 
( pained groan ) ( Audrey whimpers ) Audrey. 
( panting ) Easy, easy, easy. 
Easy. Stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
Jack, go get him. 
Go get him. Go. 
Stay with me. 
( Audrey panting ) I'll be right back. 
( groans ) Here you are. 
( groaning ) ( Jack panting ) ( groaning ) ( panting ) ( groaning ) I need to move you. 
Come on. 
( groans ) All it needs is your signature, Mr. President. 
James, we can find another way to handle this. 
There must be something I can give you, something that you want. 
You're giving me exactly what I want. 
You asked to see me, Mr. President? 
Hi, Jim. 
I thought you'd be on a plane back to Washington. 
What are you doing here? 
I'll let President Logan tell you. 
Mr. President. 
Hal... 
( phone rings ) Yes. 
HENDERSON: I have the recording. 
Really? 
I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle. 
Thank you. 
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his resignation. 
I wanted you here as a witness. 
What?! 
He came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks. 
I don't know how he can make such an accusation without any evidence. 
He orchestrated a conspiracy to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas. 
That's insane, James. 
He sanctioned the assassination of David Palmer! 
And I have the evidence. 
Where? Show it to us. 
Who was on the phone? 
Who made that call? 
( two beeps ) I want your resignation on my desk by the morning. 
If any harm comes to my daughter... 
Gentlemen! 
Please escort Secretary Heller out of my home. 
Jack, this is hard for me. 
The Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consulate. 
And now the Chinese want me. 
That's right. 
Listen to me very carefully. 
The man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you. 
Orders from who? 
Someone in Logan's camp. 
Bill Spaulding, Secret Service. 
I have orders to take Jack Bauer into custody. 
I intend to execute those orders. 
Jack! 
He's dead. 
I'm sorry. 
Oh, Jack! 
Give me the epinephrine. 
CHLOE: I hope it's not too late. 
He really looks dead. 
Come on, Jack! 
Come on, Jack, damn it! 
Hey. 
All right, Chloe, I need you to run interference with the local coroner. 
Make sure their database information. 
That won't cover the autopsy. 
There's not going to be an autopsy. 
They wanted Jack dead, now he's dead. 
Mr. President, 
you saved my life. 
PALMER: I'm only sorry it came to this. 
I just wanted to let you know that I was out. 
I'm glad. 
Jack, you do understand that when you hang up, for all intents and purposes, Jack Bauer is dead. 
JACK: I understand that, sir. 
Mr. President, 
it's been an honor. 
Jim Nichols! 
You're on pump number one. 
Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest. 
You're on pump number four. 
Phil Stone, Greg Nelson, you're on pump five. 
Sorry, guys, that's all I got today. 
Hey, Frank? 
Look, I-I know I promised you work today, but... 
pump seven went off-line last night. 
That's all right. 
I'll try again tomorrow. 
Yeah, tomorrow'll be much better. 
See you tomorrow. 
ANCHORMAN: The sun is shining, but the air is cool at President Logan's retreat, where Russian President Yuri Suvarov is expected to arrive later this morning. 
Everything worked for me, up until the chapter on your first campaign. 
I'm sorry, but I think it's a little long-winded, and I think that we can cut that down by half. 
You didn't hear a word I just said, did you? 
Yes, I was listening. 
No, you weren't. 
You're right. 
I'm sorry. 
Are you okay? 
I can use a break. 
What's going on? 
What do you mean? 
I mean you've been distracted ever since you got to Los Angeles. 
I don't know, it's... 
It's like you're somewhere else. 
Writing my memoirs... 
maybe it's put me in a melancholy mood. 
Is that all it is? 
Yeah. 
David... I'm 
your brother. 
Whatever it is, you can tell me. 
It's all right, really. 
Okay. 
Well, then let's get back to work. 
One more chapter, and we'll take a break. 
Why don't we jump down to, um, Chapter Six? 
There's going to be a lot of questions about your relationship with Sherry. 
David! 
No, no, no, no, no... 
Get help! 
Stay with me. 
Stay with me! 
Get help! 
Walt. 
My chair? 
Don't worry, Mr. President. 
I had it adjusted. 
Good. 
Adjusted? 
Wait a minute. 
What are we talking about here? 
Yuri Suvarov is over six feet. 
Russian President can't be looking down on the President of the United States when the cameras roll. 
That's a risky proposition, Walt. 
The press finds out about it, and... 
They won't. 
Don't underestimate the power of the image, Mike. 
Stalin and Churchill, they both sat for FDR at Yalta. 
This is the defining moment of my administration. 
We have to make sure that the media presents it the right way. 
( phone rings ) I'll get it. 
Yeah, put him through. 
Have you checked on my wife? 
Ah, she's still getting ready. 
She'll be fine, sir. 
Hmm. 
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill. 
I'd feel better if you would check on her yourself. 
She cannot have one of her meltdowns today. 
Look... 
you're the only one she listens to, Walt. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you. 
Mike? 
Mike, what is it? 
David Palmer's been assassinated. 
What?! 
It just happened. 
Oh, my God. 
Where? 
In L.A. 
I don't believe this. 
Mr. President, uh, CTU is 
standing by to brief you directly. 
Whenever you're ready. 
Make sure LAPD sets up a hard perimeter. 
They're sending everyone they've got. 
Where are they on witnesses? 
Nowhere yet. 
Who's running search and sweep? 
Secret Service, but they're shorthanded. 
Narrow the search area. 
Make sure ballistics runs a line-of-fire trajectory. 
Sir, President Logan's ready. 
I'll call ballistics. 
Put the President through. 
Mr. President. 
Bill... not to diminish 
the loss that we're all feeling right now, but I'm expecting the Russian President very soon, so... 
let's say what needs to be said. 
Of course, sir. 
Have you arrested the person who did this? 
Not yet, sir. 
Then what do you have? 
Sir, the damage inflicted by the single shot indicates that President Palmer was hit by a 308-caliber bullet fired from an adjacent building. 
We've initiated an interagency protocol, level five... 
Don't... don't give me 
protocols, Bill. 
Give me results. 
Whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody by the time the Russians get here. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
But until we know more, I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, sir. 
No. Absolutely not. 
Mr. President, we can't 
discount the possibility that this attack is somehow connected to the arms agreement. 
A former president was assassinated 15 miles from where you are. 
And I'm sure I don't need to explain the significance of this day. 
Do you realize what kind of political and economic capital I've spent just to get the Russians to the table? 
If we call this off, they won't come back. 
Spencer? 
Spencer! 
What? 
Get out of my bed. 
Yeah. 
I had a good time last night, too. 
I'm serious. 
This was a mistake. 
Get out of here. 
What do you mean, a mistake? 
We had a great time. 
I don't get involved with people who work for me. 
It's too late for that. 
I would appreciate it if you didn't tell everybody at work about this. 
I don't want everyone thinking I'm some kind of slut. 
Believe me, no one's ever going to think that. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
You should lighten up, you know? 
You'll live longer. 
What are you doing? 
When you quit overanalyzing the situation, I think you're gonna find out that you and I are pretty good together. 
So I'm telling you advce, yes. 
Yes, what? 
I'll let you buy me dinner. 
Get me drunk. 
Have your way with me. 
Anytime you want. 
You know, um, arrogance doesn't turn me on. 
I've read that some women respond to it, but I'm just letting you know, I don't. 
What is it? 
President Palmer's been shot. 
He's dead. 
REPORTER: While it remains unclear how the assassination will impact today's scheduled signing of the arms treaty with Russia, President Logan is expected to make a statement shortly. 
Again, if you are just joining us, former President David Palmer has been assassinated. 
We're going to take a few moments now to look at the former president's great achievements. 
Who is it? 
WOMAN: It's me, Frank. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
I saw your truck outside. 
I thought you were on today. 
Oh, Ned didn't need me this morning. 
Hmm. 
It's so terrible, what happened. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Come on, I'm making breakfast. 
Okay. 
Frank's gonna join us. 
Great. 
Derek, stop it. 
Morning. 
Morning. 
Use a glass, please. 
Here. 
Excuse me. 
Can I ask you something, Frank? 
Yeah, sure. 
That rig in Alaska you worked on, what was that called again? 
The Albatross. 
And you were thereast year? 
Yeah, why? 
It's funny. 
My friend's got a brother who's been working on that rig for five years and he's never heard of any Frank Flynn. 
It's a big platform. 
Yeah, well, my friend's brother says everyone knows everyone. 
What is this, an interrogation? 
I just don't like being lied to. 
Derek. 
No, it's all right. 
No one's lying to you, Derek. 
When you're out there, a lot of the guys just use nicknames. 
DIANE: Yeah. 
What's your friend's brother's name? 
Eat your breakfast. 
Yeah, I'm not hungry. 
Sorry. 
He's just kind of protective of me. 
But it's the best thing in the world for him to have a man around here. 
Look, what he said about me and Alaska... 
You don't owe me an explanation. 
I figure if you had wanted l me about your past you would have told me already. 
I trust my instincts. 
And I trust you. 
Former President David Palmer was killed just a short while ago. 
Now, no information has been released to the public athis time, but an independent source has verified that Palmer was in Los Angeles visiting his brother and former White... 
Bill will call if he needs us, you know that. 
No, he won't. 
Authorities are remaining very tightlipped as the LAPD and Secret Service seal off the area, and there has been no word on whether this was an accident... 
It's not our job. 
Not anymore. 
This is different. 
Come on, Michelle. 
I'm just as upset as you are. 
David Palmer meant a lot to me, too. 
But there are other people at CTU who can handle this. 
No one who was active during the other attempts onis life. 
Tony, you and I worked up suspect profiles. 
We ran scenarios. 
And theyAneth our records on file. 
They don't have our experience. 
I never once regretted our decision to leave CTU. 
But I don't want to look back on today and realize I could have helped. 
We're running a business here, Michelle. 
Rick Rosen is expecting us to make a presentation in less than an hour. 
You can handle the meeting on your own. 
Michelle, don't do this. 
It's Rick. 
Leave me a message. 
Yeah, Rick, it's Tony Almeida. 
Look, I just wanted to call you and let you know that Michelle's not gonna be able to make our meeting today. 
She had to go someplace. 
On second thought... 
I'm going with her. 
Did Jepson brief you on what's happening? 
Said there was a car bombing. 
Two former CTU agents were hit. 
Yeah, their names are Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida. 
You knew them? 
Yeah. 
We're data-mining for a connection between them and President Palmer. 
I sent the parameters to your screen. 
I'll get on it. 
Yeah? 
It's Edgar. Are you coming in? 
, I just, I  paged on a level five protocol, X of crse I'm coming in. 
I wanted to give you aveeads up before you got here. 
Heads up? 
It's bad, Chloe. 
Yeah, President Palmer was gunned down. 
I'd say that's pretty bad. 
It's not just him. 
What are you talking about? 
Someone planted a bomb in Michelle Dessler's car. 
What? 
Michelle's dead. 
He Tony's not doing too good. 
Doesn't make any sense. 
They were retired. 
Buchanan thinks it's lind to Palmer somehow. 
We're cross-referencing everything we have on Palmer with Tony and Michelle, to see if we can find a connection, anything they may have had in common. 
Chloe? 
Go. 
Chloe? 
I'll call you back. 
I'll call you back! 
Why? Chloe? 
Since I don't have to go to work today, I can take care of the fence out back if you want.wa 
Oh, that'd be great. 
I can't thank you enough for all the work you've down around here. 
It's t least I could do. 
Excuse me. 
Yeah? 
Jack, I know this isn't protocol. 
Please don't hang up on me. 
I need your help. 
Uh, hold on, I can barely hear you. 
I don't have a very good signal. 
Excuse me. 
What is it? 
They got Tony and Michelle. 
Michelle is dead. 
Tony is in critical condition. 
Now they're gonna kill me. 
What are you talking about? 
There's four people that know you're alive. 
Three of them are down. 
Jack, I'm the only one left. 
This has to be about you. 
It's the only thing the four of us have in common. 
What happened to Tony tod Michelle. 
There was a car bomb. 
X There was a guy outside my apartment and he was chasing me. 
Oh, my God. 
Where is he now? 
I think I lost him. 
I'm at a pay phone. 
I dumped my cell phone. 
I don't know what to do now. 
Chloe, you need to go dark. 
That means zero contact with anyone. 
Even CTU? 
Especially CTU. 
Whoever's behind this is probably monitori them. 
Someone out ther knows I'm still alive. 
Who? 
I don't know, but that's what we need to find out. 
Right now, I want you to head north out of Los Angeles. 
There's  abandoned oil refinery at Variel and Topanga. 
I want you to wait for me there You can take cover by the large storage tanks at the north end of the field. 
You're coming to L.A.? 
Give me about a half an ho. 
Okay. Thanks. 
Tony Almeida is being medevaced in. 
We have a trauma team standing by to receive him in medical. 
You're bringing him to CTU? 
If there's a second attempt on his life, we can't protect him in a hospital. 
This doesn't track. 
Michelle and Tony have been inactive for over a year. 
Who'd want them dead? 
Whoever wanted Palmer dead. 
So we're assuming they're connected. 
The timing was too close to write it off as a coincidence. 
There is a connection. 
Let's find it. 
Sir, the DOD liaison is here. 
I need to set her up with the security protocols for the summit. 
I'll take care of it. 
You have your assignments. 
Send updates directly to my screen. 
Where is she? 
She just cleared security. 
Thank you. 
Audrey. 
Bill. 
Must be hard for you to be back here. 
Thank you, Bill. I'm fine. 
I'm sorry about Michelle. 
Walt Cummings briefed me on the way over here. 
He said that you wanted to postpone the signing of the treaty. 
President Logan is making a mistake. 
I don't disagree. 
Have you let him know that? 
He's the President, Bill. 
It's his call. 
That's what I'm afraid of. 
He wants me to make sure that your top priority is still security for the summit. 
Station Five is set up for you. 
When you're situated, we'll go over the revised security protocol. 
Great. 
Thank you, Bill. 
David Palmer was a man of truth and of honor. 
And his influence will be felt for generations to come. 
Our nation grieves for its loss. 
Martha and I offer our deepest sympathy. 
You look beautiful, Mrs. Logan. 
I look like a wedding cake. 
Les start over. 
Oh, you can get that. 
Is Mrs. Logan ready? 
Not quite. 
You didn't tell her about David Palmer? 
No. 
Thank you. 
She'll take it hard when she finds out. 
They've been friends for a long time. 
You don't have to talk about me like I'm not here. 
Excuse us, Evelyn. 
Martha... 
I... I'm sorry. 
Look, I know... I know I'm late. 
I'm sorry. 
I just... I'm having 
a bad hair day. 
Martha... 
I've got som very bad news. 
But... it's not Charles, 
is it? 
No. No, he's fine. 
He wanted to tell you himself... 
Well... what? 
Walt, Walt... 
well, what... what is it? 
David Palmer was assassinated. 
No... 
I'm sorry. 
I know how close you were. 
When did this happen? 
Less than an hour ago. 
This morning?! 
I... 
I... I have to talk to Charles. 
He's doing damage control, trying to keep this om pushing the treaty off the front page. 
No, no, oh, no, I have to talk to him now. 
No. He's doing a 
press conference... 
No! 
Martha! 
Martha! 
Agent North! 
Call John, tell him not to let Mrs. Logan 
anywhere near the stage. 
Yeah, give me Dr. Hill. 
As I look back upon the deeds of David Palmer not only one of this country's greatest leaders, but one of this world's greatest men... 
Our nation grieves for its loss... 
Mrs. Logan... 
Let go of me. 
Let go of me! Let go! 
I can't let you... 
...to President Palmer's 
entire family. 
MARTHA: Would you get away from me? 
LOGAN: And to them, I also pledge the full resources of this great nation to find and to punish those responsible. 
AGENT: No, no, no. 
Get aw from me. 
I can't let you go out there. 
Don't-don't touch me. 
Don't touch me. 
Get away from me now, or I swear I will have your family eating dog food out of a can. 
Martha, stop it! 
Mike, damn it, I am the First Lady! 
Tell your storm trooper to stay away from me! 
CUMMINGS: Certainly. 
I need to talk to my husband. 
Martha, look... he's in the 
middle of a press conference right now. 
Hundreds of millions of people are watching him live. 
LOGAN: ...interfere with my job 
of making this country more secure. 
What is it, Martha? 
What is so urgent? 
LOGAN: ...I have decided to keep 
my scheduled meeting with the Russian president Maybe I can help. 
LOGAN: Yuri Suvarov and I will sign a comprehensive treaty that promises a new level of cooperation between us and our Russian friends in the war on terror. 
Tell Charles I want to see him when he's done. 
Don't shoot me. 
What the hell are you doing here? 
I'm sorry I followed you. 
I'm just... I'm just worried 
about my mother. 
Get up. 
Get up. Get up! 
Damn it! 
Come here. 
You're going with me. 
This is none of my business. 
This is none of my business. 
I won't tell anyone. 
Just let me go, okay? 
I really wish I could, kid, but I can't. 
You're going with me. 
Now get in the helicopter. 
Frank, Frank, come on, please. 
Get into the helicopter. 
Move! 
BESSON: Prep a sterile cranial field. 
I need access to the right hemisphere. 
I need to talk to Tony before he goes into surgery. 
He's non-responsive. 
According to the paramedic on the chopper, he suffered a closed head trauma that's affected his speech. 
They're going to try to insert a stint to relieve the pressure. 
Will he be able to talk then? 
The doctor doesn't know. 
I want real time updates on his progress. 
We need Tony to explain this. 
What is it? 
I may have found a connection between Tony and David Palmer. 
Tony's phone records? 
One call in particular. 
The last time Tony spoke to President Palmer was the day that Jack Bauer was killed. 
Pull the transcripts? 
I tried, but the files were corrupted. 
What's he hiding? 
Something about Jack's death. 
DEREK: Are you kidnapping me? 
No! 
Then where are you taking me? 
Los Angeles. 
Why? 
Because I couldn't leave you back there. 
You'd have gone to the police, and I couldn't let that happen. 
But what is this about? 
Who are you? 
Someone who's not supposed to still be alive. 
Like some kind of witness relocation thg? 
Yeah, mething lith that. 
So you were a criminal. 
No. Listen, Dere the less 
you know about me, the better. 
So what are you going to do with me? 
DIANE: Hello? 
Diane, it's me. 
Frank, I can just barely hear you. 
What's that noise? 
I'm in a helicopter with Derek. 
Derek? 
Yeah. He's fine. 
Listen, Diane, I need you to pick him up hiin Los Angeles for me. 
Why is he with you? 
I'll explain everything as soon as I see you. 
Frank, Frank, what are you doing with Derek? 
Diane, please just do this for me. 
I need you to get in a car a and start driving now. 
You're scaring me. 
Heane, do you remember this morning, when you said that you trusted me? 
Right now, I need you to trust me. 
Derek's going to be fine. 
Just do what I say. 
I need you to get in a car and start driving towards Los Angeles. 
Don't talk to anybody about this. 
And I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
Frank? 
I don't understand. 
You're just going to hand me back to my mom? 
I thought you were worried about me going to the police. 
I have something to do in Los Angeles. 
Once it's done, it doesn't matter. 
FO How are you doing? 
I'm sorry, Charles. 
I didn't mean to make a scene. 
I know that. 
Dr. Hill says you haven't 
been taking your medication. 
I don't like the way the pills make me feel. 
Martie... 
we just need to get through today. 
Charles... 
the reason that I needed to... 
eded to talk to you... 
What is it, honey? 
Go ahead. 
I think... 
that David was killed because of something he was about to tell me. 
What are you talkiou aal? 
He called me yesterday. 
He said he wanted to meet with me. 
Meet with you about what? 
He said it concerned national security, and that it involved you. 
Me? 
Yes. 
What else did he say? 
Just that he would explain when he saw me. 
If this was so important, why wouldn't he have called me himself? 
Well, Charles, you shut him out of this White House about 18 months ago. 
You know that. 
He had no real access. 
Except through you. 
You don't believe me. 
I didn't s that. 
You didn't need to. 
Martha... 
I am not making this up. 
I am not crazy; I am not a fool, Charles! 
Martha... 
it's going to be all right. 
I'm not making this up. 
All right. 
I'll have Walt look into it. 
You will? 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
But right now... 
President Suvarov and his wife are arriving in one hour. 
I need you to be there. 
I need you by my side. 
I'm sorry. 
Thank you. 
Was she all right? 
No, Walt, she's not all right. 
She's having another one of her delusions. 
She thinks that David Palmer was killed because of something he was about to tell her. 
She's imagining she's in the middle of one of her own conspiracy theories. 
Well, what should we do? 
Nothing. 
Spenser, have you talked to Chloe this morning? 
No. Why? 
She left her apartment about a half hour ago. 
She should've been here by now. 
It's probably traffic. 
She commutes against traffic. 
And she's not answering her cell phone. 
I wouldn't worry about it. 
She sounded strange when I talked to her. 
She always sounds strange. 
I'm gonna call Adamson, have him run a locate on her cell. 
Don't waste his time, Edgar. 
She's fine. 
I'm sure of it. 
What makes you so sure? 
It doesn't matter. 
It does to me. 
I saw her, okay? 
Uh, about half an hour ago. 
But I thought you said... 
Forget what I said. 
Where did you see her? 
Man... 
do you really need me to spell it out for you? 
Don't worry about Chloe. 
She's fine, all right? 
You can just let me out here. 
There's nothing here. 
Just pull over, please. 
FO I still don't understand what this is all about, Frank. 
Will you please tell me what's going on? 
Please? 
A friend of mine's in trouble. 
I needed to pick her up in a hurry. 
This is the only way I could get to her quick enough. 
X FO HeFO Chloe. 
Jack! 
Are you okay? 
I'm fine! 
What's happening? 
Why would anyone want to kill the people who know you're alive? 
I don't know yet, but we're gonna find out. 
Right now, I need to get access to CTU's archives from a secure location can you help me do that? 
I can't do it from my laptop. 
But there's a research loft at Cal Tech. 
I can get us in. 
Who's that? 
I'll explain as soon as we're in the car. 
I don't have a car. 
I took a cab. 
Come on, get in the helicopter. 
We got to go. 
Derek, get back in. 
X ( tires screech ) Jack? 
What? 
CHLOE: It's them. 
How did theydiind me? 
I don't think they ever lost you. 
Come on. 
What's going on, Frank? 
Who are they? 
What are we waiting for? Take off! 
We're not at speed!pe 
We're not gonna make it. 
Get out! Get out now, 
and stay by the side of the helicopter! 
Here! Take him and go 
into the refinery! 
Find somewhere to hide! Move! 
Double back, cut him off. 
Go through the smoke screen; I'm going around. 
Hold your fire, Chloe! 
Jack, what are you doing? 
Let's get out of here. 
Chloe, take Derek and walk away. 
Walk away now! 
At the rate you're bleeding out, you're not gonna make it unless you get medical attention. 
You tell me what I want to know, and I will get you to a hospital, you understand me? 
Do you understand me? 
Yeah. 
Four people knew I was alive. 
This morning, you tried to take them out. 
Why are you coming after me? 
Palmer was my... 
primary target. 
They only cared about Palmer. 
The others were just a diversion... 
...to set you up, 
maket look like you did it. 
Why'd they want to kill Palmer? 
To keep him from talking. 
They had to shut him up. 
What'd he know? 
HeI wasn't given that information. 
Only hired... 
to take out the principle. 
You're the one that killed Palmer. 
Yeah. 
Who's behind this? 
Oh... 
I got my orders through a code of silence. 
We never use names, you know that. 
That's all I know. 
Take me to a hospital. 
Yeah. 
I'm reprogramming a CTU key car right now. 
Good. 
Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets. 
They'll be in place soon. 
When are you launching your attacks? 
After you're done at CTU. 
GARDNER: When these terrorists attack, you're going to need to maintain order. 
I believe we should be thinking of a preemptive declaration of martial law. 
in the Greater Los Angeles area. 
If CTU can't find this man, Bierko, we're gonna get hit! 
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive? 
JACK: If you knew I was alive, you would have been at risk, and I had no choice. 
I'm happy that you're alive-- I am, but I can't give you what you want right now. 
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan. 
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas. 
Who's behind it? 
BUCHANAN: Christopher Anderson. 
Whatever he's not telling us is important. 
And he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain. 
Thousands of lives are at stake. 
There is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity, please! 
I'm sorry, guy, but I can't tell you what you want to know. 
( phone ringing ) This is Bauer. 
BUCHANAN: We've been compromised! 
Someone used a stolen key card to access CTU less than an hour ago. 
JACK: Freeze! 
Drop the gun! 
Bill, it's Jack. 
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas throughout the building. 
BUCHANAN: Code six, everybody out! 
Go, go! 
Seal all the rooms. 
Oh, no. 
Chloe. 
MAN ( over P.A. ): 
All CTU personnel. 
This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX1 nerve gas. 
Repeat: this facility has been contaminated. 
There are two safe zones on the main floor the Situation Room and Medical. 
On the second floor, the safe zones are Mr. Buchanan's office 
and Holding Room Four. 
These areas will remain sealed, pending the arrival of the Chemical Response Team. 
If you are in any of these sealed areas, do not attempt to leave until the CRT clears the environment. 
I'm on my way, but it could take 20 to 30 minutes to gather all the CRT personnel you'll need. 
I understand, Curtis, but we need CRT here now! 
This is a high priority. 
Get here as fast as you can. 
All right, copy-- I'll call you in a few minutes with updates, ( phone ringing ) This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
I just talked to Curtis. 
He's with the Chemical Response Team. 
They won't be able to get here for at least 30 minutes. 
Why not? 
Most of their units were sent to Tyler Memorial. 
The rest are en route to high probability targets. 
Okay, we're going to keep working here. 
Our networks are still up, right? 
Yeah, the phones are working, the computers are up. 
I can coordinate with Division from here. 
What do you need where you are? 
I need to know if Henderson is still alive. 
Where is he? 
Agent Burke was transferring him over to the Isolation Clinic in Medical. 
I don't know if they made it before the barriers went down. 
You can tell if you pull up a building grid. 
What about CTU's chemical response plan? 
Chloe, my name is Dr. Landes. 
Now, he was a friend of yours what was his name? 
Edgar. 
Edgar. 
LANDES: I'd like you to turn away from Edgar and focus on me, please. 
Chloe, you're in shock, and I'd like to help you through it. 
The only thing I'm going to ask you to do is sit in this chair and collect your breath. 
Let's do that now. 
Just collect your breath, just for a second. 
He was such a good guy. 
I just treated him like crap all day. 
This is my fault. 
Sir? 
Someone stole my key card and used it to get into the building. 
It was missing, and I didn't say anything. 
Why not? 
I thought they just stole my wallet for the money. 
How could you not report it? 
I was embarrassed. 
I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up. 
So we're all going to die, because you were embarrassed? 
( man groans ) Mr. Almeida, what are you doing? 
I want to know what's going on. 
No, I can't allow that. 
I'm not sitting in this damn bed while CTU is under attack got it? 
Fine. 
How long are we supposed to be sectioned off like this? 
I haven't received any news. 
Oh, my God. 
Jack, we've got the building grid. 
( dialing ) ( ringing ) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack the grid's up. 
All right, check the isolation zones that have logged in. 
You'll have survivors. 
Two zones have logged on in Medical. 
Try them. 
I'm going to keep this line open. 
Okay, hold on. 
( phone ringing ) Clinic. 
Dr. Besson, it's Jack Bauer. 
Jack, what's going on? 
One of the terrorists infiltrated CTU and deployed a canister of Sentox nerve gas through the ventilation system. 
That's why we needed to seal off as many rooms as possible. 
I need to know if Agent Burke got to Medical with Henderson. 
Yes, he did. 
Henderson's here right now? 
Tony, is that you? 
Jack, how much longer are we going to be locked down? 
Right now, we're in standby we're trying to figure out how to clean out the air supply. 
Dr. Besson? 
Dr. Besson? 
Tony! 
Get me a security feed over at Medical. 
Jack, I don't think this program is set up for that. 
Try a redirect. 
All right. 
Dr. Besson! 
( phone beeps off ) BURKE: What are you doing? 
Move aside. 
( system beeps ) My God, he's got a gun. 
Patch me through to their intercom. 
Do it. 
We'll be able to hear them, but they can't hear us yet. 
BURKE: You can't kill him. 
He's got information we need. 
He killed my wife! 
Tony, please, don't kill him. 
Move aside, Rick! 
I don't want to shoot you, but I will. 
Move it! 
Henderson! 
You remember me? 
My name is Tony Almeida. 
You killed my wife, Michelle Dessler, this morning. 
He's going to kill him-- hurry! 
Hurry! 
She was my life, and you took her. 
And now, I'm going to take yours. 
I got it. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
I've got you on the security feed. 
Stay out of this, Jack! 
Tony, please, just listen to me. 
You can't do this. 
I know how you feel right now. 
I lost Terry the exact same way, to one of our own. 
I know what it feels to be betrayed like this. 
But, Tony, Henderson has information that can save thousands and thousands of lives. 
And I know that doesn't make you feel better right now, but I know you, Tony. 
I know you don't want to make this situation any worse than it is. 
Please? 
Please, just let us finish our interrogation. 
Hurry up. 
Agent Burke, please continue. 
We have to get him talking. 
He's our only lead to Bierko and the rest of the Sentox canisters. 
Tell me where to find Bierko. 
( grunts ) Where? 
Nowhere. 
BURKE: What is your computer password? 
No. 
I know no password. 
JACK: Agent Burke, can we increase the dose? 
Not without killing him. 
Okay, take a short break and then start again. 
Get back to me as soon as you've got anything. 
Yes, sir. 
GARDNER: How could CTU have been hit? 
We're not sure, Mr. Vice President. 
Are you telling me they didn't have any safeguards in place? 
They had partial containment, but our early reports indicate that 40% of their personnel have been taken out. 
You mean they've been killed? 
We're afraid so, sir. 
CTU is protecting this city. 
Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that? 
I'm saying they've been seriously compromised, yes. 
So what are we going to do, Ms. Hayes? 
We've got terrorists with nerve gas canisters out there. 
Who is going to stop them? 
Mr. President, I suggest 
an emergency restructuring. 
Meaning what? 
Meaning that the Chemical Response Team will go in neutralize the nerve gas at CTU and I will take a team in there and personally manage the operation. 
How soon can you do that? 
Within the hour. 
Fine. Do it. 
Yes, sir. 
All right, they're still somewhat operational. 
It's not a complete disaster. 
Mr. President, it is. 
I can see no other option right now but to impose martial law on the city of Los Angeles. 
Hal, my advisors believe if the military takes over the streets and starts detaining people, it could create mayhem. 
Sir, it's only a matter of time before more canisters are released in public places and then you will have mayhem. 
Except without the soldiers you'll need to contain it. 
So what do I tell the public? 
That we've got nerve gas canisters all over the city, but we don't know where they are?! 
No, no, you don't have to get into that. 
Tie it to that earlier incident at the airport. 
I'm going to get resistance from all sides. 
That's true, sir. 
We may have to swallow some saltwater, but wouldn't it be worth it, if we can keep the people off the streets, safe from another public attack? 
I don't know, Hal. 
Sir, consider this if we clear the streets of everybody except the military, these terrorists won't be able to move as freely as they are right now. 
We have to do whatever we can to stop the people behind this. 
CTU is no longer an obstacle. 
At least for the time being. 
Good. 
Have our men move from their current positions and go to the new target. 
How much of the nerve gas will they release there? 
All of it. 
Excuse me. 
Chloe, are you ready to go back to work? 
What do you need? 
I need you. 
We can't break Henderson. 
I need you to keep trying to decrypt the files that we took from his computer. 
I already tried that. 
It didn't work. 
Maybe somebody else could do it. 
Chloe, you're the only person in the room qualified. 
Chloe, please. 
Don't shut down on me now. 
I'm upset about everything that's happening too, but you know how things work around here. 
We do not quit until it's over. 
You're not helping her. 
You're just making things worse. 
I am sure that you are qualified to help someone through this kind of distress over an extended period of time, but you see, we do not have an extended period of time. 
So if you don't mind stepping aside so I can do my job, I would appreciate it. 
Believe it or not, Jack, you don't have to be qualified to help people. 
You just have to be there for them. 
Like you were there for my daughter. 
What does that mean? 
You're 20 years older than she is. 
I know exactly what you're doing. 
I've done nothing but try and help her deal with her loss. 
How dare you accuse me of taking advantage of her. 
You did... 
Dad, stop! 
You can be angry at me all you want, but before I met Barry, I didn't want to live. 
Do you understand that? 
Fine, I'll get back to work if everyone could just relax. 
Jack, we have a problem. 
What? 
( beeping ) Chloe, I just saw the alarm. 
What's going on? 
The seal pressure indicators in the contaminated zones are showing traces of sublimated polymer near the partition seal. 
What does that mean? 
It means that the nerve gas must be mixed with a corrosive agent an acid. 
The acid's breaking down the seal between the rooms. 
How long till the seal fails completely? 
CHLOE: It's hard to say for sure. 
Can you give me an estimate? 
It's deteriorating quickly. 
I'd say 15 minutes, 20 at the most. 
And then what? 
As soon as the gas permeates the seal, it enters the room. 
Then it's over. 
Get me schematics on all the isolated zones. 
( typing rapidly ) Mr. Vice President, 
with all due respect, I'm not trying to usurp your position. 
I'm simply trying to serve the president the best way I can. 
( sighing ): Yes, sir. 
What was that about? 
I was trying to convince Gardner to let me help him draft the president's statement. 
Charles is letting Hal write his statement?! 
He's insisted. 
And the president gave him the go-ahead. 
But that means Gardner is effectively making policy. 
We've got to stop him. 
I'm trying. 
But you know what kind of pressure the president's under today. 
He wants all the counsel he can get. 
And Hal's only too eager to help out. 
Of course he's too eager. 
He's got his eye on the Oval Office. 
Anything he can do to speed up Charles' downfall puts him one step closer to the presidency. 
Martha, you have to intervene. 
Hal feeds the president ideas. 
We saw it at the WTO, we saw it in Chicago. 
When they work, Hal takes the credit for them. 
When they don't, the president takes the hits. 
Have you reminded Charles of that? 
I can't. 
Hal's the vice president. 
I'm just the chief of staff. 
You have influence that supercedes any constitutional rank. 
And now's the time to use it. 
I want to see the statement as soon as it's issued. 
You will. 
I just checked the readings from all uncontaminated zones. 
The testing you've been doing in your respective areas is consistent. 
The Sentox nerve gas that was released into the air duct system contains a corrosive agent that is eating away at the barrier seals protecting the safe zones. 
I'm not going to pull any punches. 
CRT will not be here to help us. 
At this point, our only hope is to help ourselves. 
We need to find a way to either neutralize or flush the Sentox out of the contaminated areas before the barrier seals fail and the gas enters the safe zones. 
I want all personnel working on this problem. 
We don't have much time. 
Do what you can. 
We'll hope for the best. 
Maybe we can do something from in here. 
Access the ventilation system? 
Even if I could, it doesn't mean we could do anything to stop the seals from breaking down. 
Just try. 
Maybe it's not as bad as we think. 
Maybe the numbers are off. 
They're not. 
Even if the seals leak, CRT could get here in time. 
The only reason she's here is because I asked her to stay. 
If something happens to her, it's going to be because of me. 
Because of what I did. 
There was no way that you could know that CTU was vulnerable. 
CHLOE: Jack. 
You've got something? 
I think if I can slow the seals from breaking down I can flush the contaminated areas using the air conditioning. 
Do it. 
Something's wrong. 
The control isn't responding. 
Why not? 
It's being blocked by some program that I can't get to remotely. 
It's probably on a computer near Holding Four. 
Can you get me in there? 
This is a false wall. 
The air in there is not contaminated. 
Can he get to the computer through there? 
Yes, but once he makes it through the safe zone, he'll be in a contaminated area. 
What are you talking about? 
He can't go through a contaminated area. 
I can hold my breath. 
The Sentox won't be absorbed by my skin over that short a period of time. 
As long as I don't inhale it, I'll be fine. 
Jack, you can't hold your breath that long. 
I only have to hold my breath long enough to get to the computer, disconnect the program and get back to the ventilated room. 
Once I'm back in the safe room, how long will it take you to clear out the Sentox? 
About 20 seconds based on the cubic footage. 
AUDREY: Jack, even if you get to the computer, what if we can't ventilate that room? 
Chloe thinks we can. 
Right now, this is our only option. 
CRT is not going to get here in time. 
The seals are now 80% gone. 
What's the bottom line? 
We have less than 20 minutes. 
AUDREY: All right, Jack, Chloe and I are on channel one. 
If you need to communicate with anyone else we'll patch you through. 
As soon as I go through, you have to replace this behind me. 
Jack, it's time. 
Go now. 
Now. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I just completed the airlock. 
I'm getting ready to move into the ventilation room. 
I'll tap my com unit three times when I'm back in the safe room. 
All right. Jack, 
I don't have to remind you if that airlock leaks, we'll all be dead within the next three minutes. 
It's not going to leak, Chloe. 
Okay... 
I'm going in. 
Okay. 
( inhales deeply ) * * ( computer blipping ) Seal corrosion is now at 86 percent. 
Is there anything we can do from here? 
No, we just have to wait. 
There's nothing we can do to get your dad out any faster. 
Don't talk down to me, Chloe. 
Listen, we're in a crisis situation here, okay? 
Tempers are bound to flare. 
Let's just everybody breathe. 
What's with you and the breathing? 
Is that your solution to everything? 
It's Jack, he's back in the room. 
It's too soon, he couldn't have found the program and disabled it yet. 
He's got 15 more seconds before the room clears. 
What's it mean that he finished so quickly? 
I don't know. 
Well, it could be a good thing, right? 
It could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing. 
That's what "I don't know" means. 
( computer blips ) All right, Jack, the room is clear, you can breathe. Are you okay? 
( gasps ) I couldn't get to it. 
Chloe, you're right. 
I saw it. 
There's a computer program running on the AC control unit, but there's a security grate in the wall behind the vent. 
I don't see it on my system. 
Trust me, it's there. 
I just found it. 
It was a security upgrade in the last two years. 
Somebody didn't file it properly, that's why I didn't see it. 
Are there any other vents that could help us get into that wall? 
No, they've all been upgraded. 
Well, it's a room, there's got to be a door. 
Where does it lead? 
To a corridor above Holding Four. 
None of us can get there from where we're at. 
Who's in holding room four? 
Lynn McGill. 
Are there any other vented rooms we can get him to? 
No, Jack, there's nothing. 
Patch me through to him. 
( phone rings ) ( phone beeps on ) McGill here. 
Lynn, it's Jack. 
We found a computer interrupt in the AC control unit. 
Now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas from permeating the safe zones. 
Well, that's good news. 
The problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it. 
Chloe? 
CHLOE: It's directly above the holding room where you are now. 
Take the stairs, go to the left around the corner. 
It's the room on your left. 
Okay... 
How are we going to do this, Jack? 
Lynn, the truth is if I can get there, I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough. 
No one who's still alive in CTU is. 
You're the only person who can do this. 
And I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection. 
I see. 
No, you don't. 
As soon as you open the door to the hallway, your room will become contaminated. 
You can hold your breath long enough to fix the problem, but we have nowhere else to send you. 
We can't airlock you. 
There are two of us in here, Jack. 
Sir, this is Harry Swinton. 
So you're saying that if he does this, then we're both going to die? 
I'm so sorry. 
We don't have a choice, Harry. 
How do we know that you're not just making this story up so you don't have to make the sacrifice yourself? 
You don't. 
All I can ask you to do is believe me. 
I'm telling you the truth. 
Well, that's easy for you to say, sir. 
You're not the one who's about to die. 
It's not easy for me to say. 
Hold on. 
( keypad beeps ) We have to do this, Harry. 
We're going to die anyway. 
If we don't, so will everyone in CTU. 
We have to do this. 
( phone beeps on ) Okay, Jack, go ahead. 
Once you enter the ventilation room, the computer will be on your right. 
CHLOE: There's a program running on the computer. 
You need to quit out of it, I'll take it from there. 
JACK: Lynn, we don't have a lot of time. 
I'll do it. 
Chloe... 
I'm sorry about how I acted earlier... 
and about your friend that died. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
I've been wanting to ask you something. 
Did you have contact with my dad while he was gone? 
I sent him information about once a month. 
What kind of information? 
A lot of different things. 
About me? 
Actually, almost all of it was about you. 
Your breakup with Chase, your depression... 
Wha...? 
How did you get...? 
I'm really good at getting information. 
I don't judge it, I just pass it on. 
I'm sorry about you and Chase. 
It must've been really painful. 
Yeah, it was. 
So you talked to him, too? 
Chase? No. 
You know where he is? 
No, but I could find out, if you want. 
No, no, it's all right. 
Barry thinks I should let that go. 
He's probably right. 
Yeah, well, shrinks are always giving advice that they probably don't follow themselves. 
How are you doing? 
Well, this morning I woke up with a guy in my bed that I'll probably never see again. 
And I just watched one of my best friends die right in front of me, so... 
I guess not that great. 
Yeah. 
( panting ) ( knocking ) Replace the panel. 
Pull up the security feed for the observation room. 
( typing ) You be a good girl for Mommy, okay? 
She tells you you have to go to bed, you have to go to bed. 
When you coming home? 
I don't know, honey. 
If I fall asleep, will you wake me up? 
Of course I will. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
I'm going in now, Harry. 
I love you. 
Love you, too, Dad. 
( keypad beeps ) Chloe, we're ready. 
I'm going in. 
Okay, good luck. 
And thanks for doing this. 
Yeah. 
( inhales deeply ) ( computer blips ) ( computer blips ) He did it. 
Is the AC responding? 
Yes. I'm starting the fans now. 
How long before the Sentox is neutralized? 
At least 15 minutes, but the concentration should go down enough to stop eating away at the seals immediately. 
Polymer count is down It looks like the seals will hold until all zones are clear. 
JACK: Lynn, Harry, I don't know if you can still hear me, but I want you to know what you did was successful. 
The seals are holding. 
I will personally notify your families and tell them of the sacrifice you made. 
I'm so sorry. 
I don't know what else to say. 
Thank you. 
( gasps deeply ) ( gasping ) I'm okay... 
I'm okay. 
( heaving breaths ) ( gasping ) ( gags ) Oh, my God. 
( gasps deeply ) ( grunts ) ( gags, coughs ) ( grunting ) Pull up the security feed to Medical. 
Can you hear me? 
What's your name? 
No... 
No name. 
You're wasting your time. 
Agent Burke, this is Jack Bauer. 
What have you got from Henderson? 
Nothing. He's still not talking. 
Okay, keep working on him. 
As soon as the barriers go up, I'll get back to you. 
Chloe, I don't think we're going to break Henderson now. 
All the information that we're going to get is from his computer. 
I need you to keep working on those files. 
Most of my team is gone. 
How am I going to do that? 
Only work on his files. 
Kim, as soon as the barriers go up, I want you go over to Medical and let them check you out. 
No, Dad, when the barriers go up, I'm leaving. 
Kim, please, just do this for me. 
We still need to talk. 
There's nothing to talk about. 
Don't be in such a hurry to cut me off. 
You cut me off. 
Listen to me, I'm not angry. 
I love you. 
But there's nothing left to say except I don't want to be around you. 
Every time I am, something horrible happens. 
People die, and I know that's not your fault, but I can't be a part of it. 
I don't want you to be a part of that. 
All I want is for one day you and I just to be able to spend time together. 
Kim, I had to give you up once, I'm not going to let that happen again. 
Dad... 
I can't. 
Hi. 
Hey. 
God, that was close. 
I know. 
Are you all right? 
No. 
An emergency peacekeeping force. 
It was Hal's suggestion. 
I think it works. 
Charles, aren't you afraid that an edict of this kind could do far more damage than any chemical weapon ever could? 
Martha, CTU has been attacked. 
Our first line of defense is shut down and people were killed because of this chemical weapon. 
And that's just a prelude to what's going to happen in this city. 
More nerve gas will be released, I can guarantee it. 
Look, if you or Mike you have any better ideas please, I would be glad to hear them. 
What is it, Martha? 
If you, Charles Logan, really feel that martial law is your only option, I will support you. 
But what I will not do is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda. 
Please, Martha, give me some credit. 
He has done it before. 
He is not the president. 
You are. 
I am doing this because it's the right thing to do! 
I don't know how much more of this I can take. 
I really don't. 
David's assassination, the nerve gas, the murder of those hostages, Walt Cummings' betrayal, and you... 
I almost lost you. 
I didn't lose you, did I? 
No, Charles. 
You didn't lose me. 
I'm still here. 
Yes. 
Good. 
The men are there. 
They need the schematics. 
( phone rings ) Who is it? 
Just a client. 
Hello. 
Have you got it yet? 
I told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything. 
I'm still waiting on a few items. 
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette. 
And if you could have gotten the detailed specs of a facility this secure from someone else, you would have. 
But you didn't. 
You called me and I'll have it for you in a few minutes. 
What's wrong? 
Nothing. 
Difficult client. 
I wish I knew exactly what it is you did. 
I might be able to help. 
You do help me. 
Oh, I can't. 
I have to go and finish something. 
Finish this. 
How long till the air will be safe to breathe? 
( phone ringing ) All right, thank you very much. 
Buchanan. 
Mr. Buchanan, this is 
Karen Hayes from Homeland Security. 
Karen. 
I'm running a damage assessment and I need your body count. 
We don't have a body count yet. 
We'll know more when CRT gets here and the barriers lift. 
What's your best estimate? 
I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in Comm and 35 in Tactical and other departments. 
All right, well, I'm on my way over there with a core team. 
We can make adjustments when I get there. 
You coming here now? 
Yes. 
I see. 
I'll be there soon. 
How's your progress? 
Good. 
I've already reformatted their main servers to our specs. 
All their tactical protocols will have to go through me. 
Good. 
I may have to replace some of their personnel with my people. 
Do you have a problem with that? 
Absolutely not. 
After what these people have been through, most of them won't be up to full capacity. 
We need to identify these people quickly and send them home. 
What about chain of command? 
Am I going to need approval from Bill Buchanan if I want to make a personnel change? 
No, Bill won't be in charge when we get there, I will. 
For all intents and purposes, CTU is no longer an operation entity. 
It's a building with workers who will report to us. 
We're clear. 
I'm going back to Medical. 
All right. 
Kim, I have to finish this now. 
I know. 
Good-bye, Dad. 
Good-bye. 
Excuse me, Jack. 
I just wanted to say thank you for saving our lives. 
I mean, we definitely couldn't have gotten through this without you. 
Take her outside of the city. 
Don't make any stops. 
You understand? 
Bye. 
Looks like he's dead. 
No. His nervous system 
is shut down. 
Well, can you wake him up? 
No. 
( phone rings ) Almeida. 
Tony, it's Jack. I'm on my way. 
Yeah, Jack, Henderson's in a coma. 
He's not coming out of it. 
You've had your chance. 
He's mine now. 
Damn it, Tony, just wait until I get there! 
No, I'm done waiting. 
You don't want to do this. 
It's not going to bring back Michelle. 
No, but I'll feel better. 
Trust me, it won't. 
You're probably right. 
I'll let you know. 
Tony! Tony?! 
What'd Jack say? 
He's on his way here. 
We'll figure out what to do when he gets here. 
There's nothing to figure out. 
This guy's cooked. 
* * ( grunting ) Tony! Tony! 
I-I couldn't do it. 
It's all right. 
It's all right. Come on. 
You stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
I need help! 
Somebody help! 
No, no... no, hang on. 
Hang on! 
She's gone, Jack. 
00:00:00,-400 --> 00:00:04,600 =THE LAST FANTASY= Proudly Presents =TLF SUB TEAM= EngSub by snowmoon Have you got it yet? 
Told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything. 
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette. 
And if you could've gotten the detailed specs of a facility this secure from someone else, you would've. 
CTU is no longer an obstacle. 
MAN: This facility has been contaminated with Sentox VX1 nerve gas. 
Repeat: this facility has been contaminated. 
Everybody, leave the situation room. 
Move! Now! 
Seal it. 
Lynn, it's Jack. 
We found a computer interrupt in the AC control unit. 
Now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas from permeating the safe zones. 
The problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it. 
Lynn, the truth is if I could get there, I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough. 
And I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection. 
He did it. 
Oh, my God. 
( groans ) CTU is protecting this city. 
Are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that? 
I'm saying they've been seriously compromised here. 
We've got terrorists with nerve gas canisters out there. 
Who is going to stop them? 
Mr. President, I suggest 
an emergency restructuring. 
CTU is no longer an operational entity. 
It's a building with workers who will report to us. 
I can see no other option right now but to impose marshal law on the city of Los Angeles. 
What I will not do is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda. 
You killed my wife Michelle Dessler this morning. 
She was my life. 
And you took her. 
My God, he's got a gun. 
You can't do this. 
We have to get him talking. 
He's our only lead to Bierko and the Sentox gas canisters. 
You've had your chance. 
He's mine now. 
Tony! 
Oh, my God! 
Jack, I am so sorry. 
Security find Henderson yet? 
No, he got out of the building before the lockdown. 
An external cam got a shot of him as he was leaving. 
And the car that he was using was found a block away. 
But I think that we might've got what we needed from him. 
What are you talking about? 
Chloe was able to decrypt a file from his computer. 
She got a name of someone connected to Bierko. 
Who's Collette Stenger? 
She's an international intelligence broker. 
State secrets, intellectual property. 
What's her connection to Bierko? 
Interpol claims that she and Bierko met at least twice over the last eight months. 
And we think she helped broker the deal. 
Is she still in Los Angeles? 
She gave a name of a hotel to customs. 
But nothing's to say that she's actually there. 
Curtis is prepping a tactical team to try to bring her in. 
Okay. 
Good work. 
( cell phone rings ) Manning. 
Curtis, it's Jack. 
When is the tac team leaving? 
Right now. 
I'm going with you. 
All right. 
I have no intention... 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, member of the press corps... 
Just so you're aware, there will be no Q&A following the president's statement. 
But you can submit questions to my office... 
You're having second thoughts? 
Putting soldiers on the streets of L.A., 
this will not be a popular announcement. 
Maybe not. 
But it's the right move. 
Hal, would you excuse us, please? 
Mrs. Logan, the president's 
about to go on the air. 
I'll be brief. 
I would like a moment alone with my husband. 
BROWN: Now, before we begin, I want to take a second to address an issue of security. 
I understand that many of you have been here since early... 
I've made up my mind, Martha. 
I'm not debating this anymore. 
Just listen, listen please. 
Mike Novick spoke to someone at CTU. 
They think they have a lead on this man, this man Bierko. 
They think they may find him before he launches another attack. 
CTU was just hit. 
40% of their people are either dead or unable to work. 
To think that they would be able to stop this attack, that's just wishful thinking. 
Maybe not. 
( sighs ) Bringing the military in is the best way to maintain order. 
The Vice President's right about that. 
Of course he is. 
What's that mean? 
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that he proposed this whole thing to set you up for a fall? 
So he gets the nomination next year. 
That's insane. 
Hal's only motivation is what's best for the country. 
There's going to be fallout. 
Hal knows it. 
And you know it. 
I have to go. 
Charles... 
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. 
As you all know, America has been hit today by a series of terrorist strikes, beginning with the assassination of former President David Palmer and the murder of innocent Americans at Ontario Airport, followed by the attempted assassination of Russian President Yuri Suvarov. 
These events are being orchestrated by terrorists operating within our borders. 
Our most recent intelligence suggests that they will strike again and soon. 
I can and will do my sworn duty to ensure the safety of the American people. 
Therefore I am issuing an executive order imposing a curfew on all civilians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. 
This curfew will be effective immediately and will be enforced by the military. 
As disruptive and distasteful as I know this is for many of you, I would ask that you remember that we are at war. 
Bracing ourselves against future attacks... 
D.O.D. is asking for a list 
of our casualties. 
I don't want any names released until the next of kin have been notified. 
Let me know when that happens. 
This place is a sinking ship. 
We should be taking over now, not going through the charade of an assessment. 
Until we're ready to transition, we need everyone here functioning. 
Once the remaining canisters of nerve gas have been found and the terrorists captured, then we'll assume full control. 
Karen. 
Hello, Bill. 
Bill Buchanan, Miles Papazian from my office. 
I appreciate your coming, but that wasn't necessary. 
We just need to replace some key personnel. 
We're all sorry about the loss of lives here, but the White House feels you may need more than that. 
They want an assessment of how Homeland may best assist CTU. 
I'll brief you in my office. 
Fine. 
Miles, familiarize yourself with the networks, and then start the survey. 
Let's go. 
Upstairs. 
Chloe O'Brian? 
Who are you? 
Homeland Security. 
I asked your name, not who you work for. 
I need a vacant station set up. 
I'm kind of busy right now. 
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles listed on my report as a casualty. 
Is that right? 
Yeah. 
Then his station should be available. 
I'll set up over there. 
I'll be reinstalling operating protocols for everyone in your group, so I'll need your keycard. 
No. 
I'm sorry? 
You can't have my keycard. 
We're here with a priority admin directive. 
You can confirm that with your supervisor on your own time. 
REPORTER: We're live in Los Angeles, where just a few minutes ago, Army units stationed in L.A. County 
began moving in force across city limits. 
This is the first time a military presence of this scale has been activated in a major metropolitan area. 
While White House officials have stopped short of officially declaring full-scale martial law... 
Where are you going? 
I just need some fresh air. 
These mobile Army divisions were activated shortly after the President's press conference in which he declared an enforced curfew. 
Officials are hoping the curfew will prevent further acts of terror. 
I do not trust him. 
Ma'am? 
The Vice President. 
( cell phone ringing ) This is Aaron Pierce. 
Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer. 
Sir, I am so sorry about President Palmer, more sorry than I can describe. 
Aaron, I know how close you were to my brother. 
You must have known he felt the same way about you. 
Thank you for saying that. 
Actually, Aaron, he's the reason I'm calling. 
There's something from my brother I need to give you personally. 
I should be there within the hour. 
You're coming here? 
Yeah, I know it sounds impulsive, Aaron. 
But I'd rather see you sooner than later. 
There's a curfew in effect, sir. 
I know, I know. 
I left before it was declared. 
If I may say so, this is an odd request. 
Aaron, my brother trusted you with his life. 
I am asking you to trust me. 
All right. 
I'd also appreciate it if you would keep this between us. 
I'm hoping there's somewhere we can meet discreetly. 
I'll find a place. 
Thank you, Aaron. 
I'll call you when I'm close. 
REPORTER: The effects of this action will no doubt ripple across the country, as other cities begin to take note. 
So while legislators debate the legality of President Logan's action, martial law is already a fact... 
Mike, turn it off. 
...on the ground, 
here in Los Angeles. 
( TV turns off ) "Debate the legality of President Logan's action." 
Did you hear that? 
They're talking about this like it's an illegal action. 
Don't worry, Mr. President. 
I'm in control of the situation. 
Our legal people are working on it right now. 
Do we have anything more from CTU? 
They're still following up on this Bierko lead. 
As soon as they have something to report, we'll be the first to hear. 
Give me details of the current threat assessment. 
There's a high probability that Bierko is planning an attack on a much larger scale than anything we've seen today. 
That's why he targeted CTU to cripple our ability to stop him. 
And the question is: Was he successful? 
When you look at the numbers, you were harder hit than you thought, Bill. 
We're still functioning. 
Maybe not at a 100%, but when you install the people I've asked for... 
we'll be back to fighting strength. 
Have you made any progress finding Bierko? 
We've identified a woman we believe might lead us to him. 
Collette Stenger. 
We've just sent a tac team to bring her in. 
Good. 
I enjoy watching you get dressed almost as much as I enjoy watching you get undressed. 
You should get dressed yourself and send the bags down. 
This deal you're working on, I hope you're getting a lot of money for it. 
I never talk about my business, you know that. 
I know... 
but Maria called about this villa in Positano. 
She said when you see it, you'll love it. 
We'll call her later. 
I'll see you at the airport, okay? 
In 45 minutes. 
I'll be there. 
( cell phone ringing ) Yes. 
I'm on my way. 
And you have everything I asked for? 
Of course. 
Good. 
Do you have the money? 
As soon as I verify the merchandise, I'll have it transferred to your account. 
I'll be there soon. 
Does she have the schematics and the access codes? 
Yes. 
Everything we need. 
The Distribution Center is a difficult target. 
It would be much easier to hit a less secure location. 
No, Mikhail, this is the place. 
Release the Sentox here... 
and 200,000 people die. 
And we need a second satellite repositioned as soon as possible. 
Good. Thank you. 
I saw a request for proficiency evaluations for all CTU personnel on my secondary screen. 
That's a formality. 
The fact is, we don't have time for evaluations right now. 
Then why was it put in the pipeline? 
Like I said, it's a formality. 
You're here to shut this place down, aren't you? 
And the evaluations will be filled in later as a matter of protocol. 
I told you before, the White House... 
I know what you told me before. 
Now tell me the truth. 
The truth is, CTU is being absorbed by Homeland. 
Which means, from now on, every operational decision needs to go through me. 
Bill, what did you expect? 
You've been infiltrated. 
56 of your people have been killed. 
The others are demoralized... 
They're not demoralized, they're angry! 
They want to fight back. 
They're willing to lay down their lives. 
Some already have... 
It's done, Bill. 
The decision's been made. 
And I know neither one of us wants this transition to interfere with ongoing protocol, so let's just keep it between us. 
At least until this crisis plays out. 
There. 
Bill? 
Homeland is being overly aggressive with their survey. 
What is going on? 
Nothing. 
It's just a formality. 
They'll be gone as soon as they finish their evaluation. 
Where are we on the military mobilization? 
Martial law is in effect in nine of the 15 L.A. districts. 
I'm setting up checkpoints for the rest of the county now. 
I hope the president's doing the right thing. 
CURTIS: Alpha Team, we're approaching Collette Stenger's apartment and we're ready to move. 
Are you in position? 
AGENT ( over radio ): Affirmative. 
We've got the lobby covered. 
CURTIS: Copy. 
I think she went for the roof. 
Cover the stairs. 
Let's go. 
We're going up top. 
JACK: Drop the gun! 
Stand down or he dies! 
I said stand down! 
Our people are all around you. 
They will drop you before you could pull that trigger. 
Put the gun down! 
What do you mean your "people?" 
Who are you? 
Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles. 
Show me identification. 
I'm with the German Federal Intelligence Service. 
My name's Theo Stoller. 
What are you doing in this country? 
I'm here on special assignment... 
by agreement between our governments. 
Now you can get the hell out of here before you destroy my cover. 
That's not going to happen. 
CHLOE ( over phone ): O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I want you to check on a foreign agent on the SA list. 
"Theo Stoller." 
Okay. 
Got it: "Theo Stoller, height, 5'll", brown hair, brown eyes." 
He's a German operative, but trained in England at MI-6. 
There's even contact information: cell phone... 
That's all right, Chloe. 
That's enough, thanks. 
I told you, you have to get out of here now. 
We can't do that. 
You were with Collette Stenger. 
We need her to help us find Vladimir Bierko. 
I don't know him. 
Bierko's responsible for the terrorist attacks that took place in the city earlier today. 
He's preparing to mount another one as we speak. 
Collette Stenger is the only way we can find him. 
Where is she? 
I can't help you. 
Why not? 
Giving you Collette jeopardizes my operation. 
What operation? 
I've been undercover for the last six months gathering intel on Collette's clientele. 
We've identified cells in three countries, but she's connected to a dozen more. 
She's too valuable to give up. 
If we don't find Bierko, hundreds of thousands of innocent people will die here today. 
That is more important than your preemptive operation. 
It's not a question of importance, it's a question of different agendas. 
Your job is to save American lives. 
Mine to save German lives. 
You're asking me to betray my duty to my country. 
Ask yourself what you would do in my position. 
You better start asking yourself what you would do in mine. 
Now, let's go. 
I'm here by permission of your government you can't touch me. 
Right. 
We'll see about that. 
Well, make sure that your superior understands that if this attack happens, my government will hold your country accountable. 
Jack, it's Buchanan. 
Audrey will be joining us momentarily. 
You're also on the line with Karen Hayes from Homeland Security. 
She's been providing support to CTU, and she's also been in contact with the White House. 
Did President Logan get in touch with the German Chancellor? 
He's tried; the chancellor's unreachable for another hour. 
We don't have another hour. 
They're stalling, there's nothing we can do about that. 
Jack, this is Audrey. 
I was just speaking with German Intelligence. 
They're refusing to order their agent to cooperate with us. 
Maybe you can get a deal with him. 
Okay, I'll talk to Stoller again. 
Good. Call me 
if you get him to change his mind. 
Yeah. 
Curtis? 
Let me have a moment with him alone. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
It's all right. 
All right. 
Your intelligence service denied our request for cooperation. 
So has your government. 
I'm not surprised. 
Collette Stenger is a golden goose. 
There's no upside in giving her up. 
Maybe I could provide you with one. 
Meaning? 
I will give you something that is more valuable than Collette Stenger. 
It's hard to know what that might be. 
Our roster of all known terror suspects working around the world, our WET list. 
As allies, we've requested this WET list many times before. 
But the NSA has always said, giving us the list would jeopardize their operations. 
It will. 
I don't work for the NSA, I don't work for CTU. 
This is personal. 
And right now, you're not giving me another choice. 
All right. 
I'll give you Collette in exchange for the WET list. 
Okay. 
Let's see what we can do. 
Agent Bauer. 
I'm aware of several names that should be on that list. 
Don't try and pass me a fake. 
( phone ringing ) O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Do we still have a back door into NSA's secured mainframe? 
I can't really talk right now, Jack. 
Okay, fine. Then, listen. 
I need you to log on to their server, download the WET list, and send it to my PDA immediately. 
Why? 
The WET list is what we're gonna have to pay to get Collette Stenger. 
Jack, that list is as top secret as it gets. 
Homeland Security sent a team over here. 
You're gonna have to clear it with them. 
We can't afford to take the chance of them saying no. 
I'm not saying I won't do it without their approval. 
I'm saying I can't. 
They took my keycard. 
I can't get into the NSA mainframe without it. 
Just do what you have to. 
It's our only way to get Bierko. 
Fine. I'll call you back. 
Excuse me, Miles. 
Oh! 
( gasps ): My God! 
What is the matter with you? 
Sorry. 
What's wrong with you? 
I'll pay for the dry cleaning. 
JACK: Yeah? 
Jack, I got on the NSA server. 
Did you get the file? 
Not yet. They put 
an extra layer of authentication in place. 
Can you get around it? 
Hold on. 
Okay, I got it. 
I hope you know what you're doing. 
I'm uploading it now. 
Thanks. 
I got it. 
Well, that appears legitimate. 
It is. 
Give me back the memory card. 
You can't upload the WET list to your people until I have Collette Stenger in custody. 
Well, fair enough. 
We have to go now. 
I'm supposed to meet her at the Van Nuys airport in less than 20 minutes. 
What kind of a car is she driving? 
I don't know. 
I'm supposed to park in car Lot C and wait for her. 
She'll probably recon the area before she makes contact. 
She's, uh, cautious by habit. 
Curtis, we're on the move Van Nuys Airport. 
We'll give you the details when we're on the way. 
When you receive the funds, transfer them immediately into the Caymans account. 
In Euros. 
My bank is ready to accept the transfer. 
The file is encrypted. 
What is the decryption key? 
Transfer the funds. 
It's been sent. 
Thank you. 
E-mail me confirmation of the transfer. 
The decryption key is Charlie alpha three nine alpha. 
It worked. 
This is what you wanted. 
Of course it is. 
Until next time, gentlemen. 
Are the men ready? 
Yes. 
Torch this place. 
We're moving out. 
Governor, I'm not trying to co-opt your authority, but we are in the middle of a crisis here. 
Now, you can either transmit my orders word for word to the National Guard, or I can federalize them, and give them my orders directly, your choice. 
Excellent. 
Thank you, Governor. 
I look forward to your cooperation. 
Sir, we have a situation at one of the roadblocks that the region three commander needs your call on. 
Tell me. 
Wayne Palmer is insisting he be let through one of our roadblocks. 
He claims he still has his clearance and that he's on official business. 
And where exactly is that? 
He was stopped trying to get on the access road coming towards the retreat. 
He's on his way here? 
To do what? 
He wouldn't give the officer in charge of the roadblock any information. 
What should I tell the roadblock, sir? 
Captain, all I'm asking you to do is call and confirm I have a grade two clearance, that's it. 
Sir, regardless of your clearance, authorization to let you through must come down through the appropriate chain of command. 
And just who would that be, huh, Captain? 
Who's in charge of the military's role in this? 
( phone ringing ) Riggs. 
Understood. 
Thank you, sir. 
You can go on through now, sir. 
Let him through. 
Thank you, Captain. 
CURTIS: All teams are in position, Jack. 
No one moves in until I confirm that it's her. 
Copy that. 
Collette won't show herself if she senses anything's wrong. 
Make sure he stays hidden. 
Don't worry. He will. 
What will happen to her? 
To Collette. 
I don't know yet. Why? 
Uh, just curious. 
You've been in my situation? 
I've been undercover for long stretches of time, yeah. 
And been involved with a woman during that time? 
There's no question we are doing what has to be done for our countries, but sometimes it's harder than others. 
Chloe, could you join us in the Situation Room, please? 
Sure. 
What's going on? 
Why don't you tell us, Ms. O'Brian? 
I don't know. 
We've got you hacking into a top secret NSA archive. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
MILES: I pulled a mirrored archive of your web traffic. 
Whatever you took from NSA was uploaded to Jack Bauer's remote node. 
Ms. O'Brian, tell us exactly 
what document you passed to Jack Bauer. 
BUCHANAN: Chloe, this is going to get much worse if you force me to have NSA run a back trace. 
What is it? 
Jack needed the WET List. 
What?! 
Why on earth would you give him that? 
Theo Stoller wouldn't lead us to Collette Stenger without it. 
Chloe, giving that list to another intelligence agency could be disastrous. 
Years of work could be rendered useless, our own agents could be exposed. 
Jack needed it, okay? 
No! No, it's not okay. 
And you expected us to give your agents a chance? 
Get me Bauer. 
( phone ringing ) Put it on speaker phone, or I'm getting out of this car. 
Fine. 
This is Bauer. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, it's Bill. 
Karen Hayes is here, as well. 
If you're with Theo Stoller, get some place you can talk privately. 
I can't. We're in the middle 
of an operation. 
If I move, I'll jeopardize our position. 
Then you'll have to have this conversation in front of him. 
Have you given him the WET List yet? 
Yes. 
Has he given it to German Intelligence? 
No. 
Then get it back. Now. 
I can't. 
If I do that, Stoller won't cooperate. 
And then we'll lose Collette Stenger. 
Bill, will you explain this to her? 
It's not his decision. 
Retrieve the WET list now, or I will order Agent Manning and his team to do it. 
Right now, Collette Stenger is our only connection to Bierko. 
If you blow this operation, you will be responsible for every life lost in his next attack. 
I don't like to be threatened, Mr. Bauer. 
Ms. Hayes, that's not a threat, 
that's a fact. 
HAYES: German Intelligence will move preemptively on people that we have been watching for years. 
Our ability to prevent terrorist attacks will be severely threatened. 
Then that's a risk we'll have to take. 
Right now, we have to deal with this situation. 
It's not your call. 
It's not mine, either. 
We need authorization from the President. 
Then get it. 
CURTIS: Jack, one of our forward teams I.D.'d a woman fitting 
Stenger's description driving a red Lexus making its second circuit around the lot. 
This could be her. 
We have a possible suspect approaching. 
Ms. Hayes, are you 
telling me that I have to abort this operation? 
Yes or no? 
Ms. Hayes, this is your call. 
You don't know for certain that this woman will lead us to Bierko. 
No, not for certain. 
But, right now, she's our only lead. 
Are you willing to take this chance? 
You've left me no choice. 
Proceed. 
But you have severely compromised this situation and I promise you there will be repercussions. 
Fine. 
Are we all right? 
We're fine. 
CURTIS: Red Lexus turning the corner. 
A hundred yards away and approaching. 
No one move until I give a go. 
The red Lexus is parked. 
Move the center mirror, so that I can see the car. 
There. 
Now get her out of the car. 
Hi. 
Hello. 
JACK: I have a positive I.D. 
All teams move in. 
All teams move, move, move! 
Let's go! 
Put your hands where I can see them! 
Theo, get in the car, now. 
Let me see your hands! 
What are you doing? 
Now! 
Let me go. 
Theo, get out of there. 
I'm sorry. 
Theo, who are you? 
Move! 
Letting him go. 
He's given us what we want! 
Put your hands up! 
Turn and face the car! 
Put your hands on the roof! 
Do it! 
Where is Bierko? 
We know you're working with Bierko. 
Where is he? 
Fine. 
Take her back to staging. 
I want a team searching this car. 
Take everything back to the staging area. 
Now! 
It's Theo. 
I'm en route to the hotel. 
Tell Heinrich I'm uploading something he's been wanting for a long time. 
( phone rings ) Stoller. 
Theo, it's Jack. 
I'm sorry. 
I thought we had a deal. 
When this is over, I promise you, I will help you rebuild your investigation. 
I give you my word. 
I had your word. 
What have you got? 
Nothing. 
She's covered her tracks. 
There's no sign of what she sold to Bierko. 
Come with me. 
Collette Stenger, my name is Jack Bauer. 
Who is Theo really? 
German Intelligence. 
Then he sold me for a price. 
German and American Intelligence don't work together often. 
Where is Bierko? 
The fact is, I actually had feelings for Theo. 
I never once suspected. 
He was very good. 
I always thought that there were some things that you cannot fake. 
Bierko. 
Tell them to leave. 
Jack? 
It's all right. 
Curtis, have your men move back. 
Just give us a second. 
Let's go. 
Theo had a price. 
What's yours? 
I'm not for sale. 
Everyone is for sale. 
This isn't a game, lady. 
We're running out of time. 
You better tell me what you want. 
All right. 
Full immunity. 
No holdbacks. 
Signed by your president and transmitted to lawyers in Zurich and Tripoli. 
But I can't tell you where Bierko is. 
Why not? 
Because he's already gone. 
I met him at a safehouse, but he was already on his way to carry out the attack. 
What were you selling him? 
I don't know. 
What do you mean, you don't know? 
I mean I don't know. 
It was a schematic. 
What kind of a schematic? 
I'm paid to broker the information, not dwell on the details. 
I make it my firm policy. 
You expect me to believe that you acquired information for a terrorist group and you didn't know the specifics? 
You can believe whatever you want. 
The fact is, I got the schematics from a source and they were digitally encrypted. 
That source can tell you what they mean. 
Give me immunity and I'll give you my source. 
Those are my terms. 
You haven't offered us very much. 
I'll see what I can do. 
( phone rings ) Buchanan. 
Yeah, it's Jack. 
She wants full immunity signed by the president. 
She claims that she doesn't know where Bierko is. 
That she just brokered a deal for a set of schematics, and then delivered them. 
She doesn't know what building they're for, but she can provide us with the source of the schematics. 
She doesn't know what she sold him? 
She said it was digitally encrypted. 
Do you believe her? 
She's an independent contractor. 
In her line of work, sometimes what you don't know will save your life. 
Either way, if she's telling the truth, we don't have a lot of time. 
She said Bierko already left to set off his next attack. 
Miles, call Mike Novick, let's get this started. 
Jack, this better work. 
And for the record, I don't like it. 
We've paid a steep price. 
There'll be fallout on the WET List. 
No, there won't be. 
The fallout will be from German Intelligence. 
I programmed the memory card to self-destruct. 
Why didn't you tell us this before? 
I told you, I was in the car with Stoller. 
Get back to me as soon as this is done, we need to move fast. 
I think it's clear. 
CTU was hit, but we're still doing our job. 
I believe that's an argument to maintain our autonomy. 
Well, I'll withhold judgment on that. 
We're giving a free pass to a terrorist collaborator, and I have yet to see what we're getting from it. 
( tires screeching ) ( panting ) Has the document been received in Tripoli as well? 
And it meets with your approval? 
So, there's no way that they can fail to live up to the terms? 
Merci, Herve. Au revoir. 
The safehouse is a manufacturing facility at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard. 
As for the data I sold to Bierko, it's something that I received from a contact at the Department of Defense. 
What's his name? 
Her name. 
Audrey Raines. 
You are lying to me. 
She sold me the information, Mr. 
Bauer. 
Apparently she had a price. 
Put her in the car. 
=TLF SUB TEAM= http://tlfsub.eastgame.net 
Any problems getting the canisters out? 
No. They were hidden exactly 
where you said they'd be. 
Russians will finally understand the consequences of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard. 
Erwich has just cleared airport security. 
Then the authorities don't know anything's been stolen. 
Not yet. 
Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer. 
You paged me? 
I need you to do something. 
We have our hands full searching for the nerve gas. 
Bauer is a priority. 
I just signed a treaty. 
Now all of a sudden I find out that the terrorists are still out there... 
with nerve gas. 
MARTHA: You people have to listen to me. 
I had a document. 
It was hidden in my blouse. 
It's gone. 
Someone stole it from me. 
This is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont. 
Are you suggesting that I readmit her? 
For her sake, if nothing else. 
Aaron, my wife is gone. 
We have a priority alert. 
You've been burrowing into classified CTU protocols without authorization. 
SPENSER: I don't know what you're talking about. 
Stop. I know you logged on 
to the security subsystem where you had no right to be. 
AUDREY: Someone knew that Jack was alive. 
It's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was. 
( grunting ) Did you let that man into CTU? 
This man is a professional assassin. 
He just killed Dr. Paulson, 
he tried to kill me. 
Who told you to let that man into CTU? 
The White House. 
Mr. Cummings. 
JACK: I don't understand the problem. 
David Palmer was murdered because he was about to expose Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists. 
When Cummings failed to frame me for Palmer's murder, he tried to kill me. 
All that may be true, Jack, but we don't have proof. 
We can prove that Cummings used Spenser to get Jack's assassin into CTU. 
All we have is Spenser's word. 
That's not enough to build a case. 
You don't have time to build a case. 
You want the nerve gas, Cummings is your connection. 
Cummings is the President's Chief Advisor. 
How exactly do you suggest we get to him? 
I can secretly meet with Mike Novick, enlist his help. 
How do we know Novick's not in this with Cummings? 
Because I know him. 
He'll listen to me. 
And the President will listen to him. 
With Novick's help, we can isolate Cummings. 
Jack, as much as I appreciate you wanting to be involved, you don't work here anymore. 
That's exactly the reason why I should do this. 
If it backfires, there'll be no fallout on you. 
I think it's worth a try. 
I agree. 
It's your call. 
( sighs ) All right, Jack. 
But just so we're clear, this is about finding the nerve gas, not getting revenge for David Palmer. 
Understood. 
Work out your protocols with Ms. Raines. 
We'll keep looking through Cummings' background for anything that supports our case. 
We're gonna need to set up a secure channel for you to contact us on. 
We'll drop you as close to Logan's retreat as possible. 
Can you bring up the satellite photo of the compound? 
Jack, I'm sorry if I'm being a little distant. 
I just... 
It's taking me a little while to get used to you being alive. 
I understand. 
I'll call Novick. 
Jack. 
When Cummings finds out that you're still alive, he's gonna come after you again. 
Yeah. 
( cell phone ringing ) Yes? 
NATHANSON: Is Bauer dead? 
I haven't received confirmation yet. 
Your man should have taken care of this by now. 
Perhaps he had to alter his strike window. 
Has the nerve gas reached the port? 
Not yet. 
But they should be arriving any minute. 
Good. I have to go. 
I'm late for a briefing. 
You have all the shipping documents in order? 
The canisters will arrive at port in your country in eight days. 
Ground transportation to your base camp will take another day. 
Will you need my help getting them to your target? 
No. I've arranged 
transport to Moscow. 
( indistinct talking ) Have they found my wife yet? 
No, sir, but Secret Service is confident she's still on the grounds. 
If they're so damn confident, why can't anyone find her? 
What the hell are they doing? 
I'm sure it's just a matter of time, Mr. President. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I was just setting up the video. 
This was made by terrorists, to document the effects of exposure to nerve gas. 
It was recovered from a training camp two years ago. 
Disorientation occurs moments after exposure. 
Now the video jumps forward, no more than a couple of minutes, we estimate. 
Within that time, there's permanent damage to the central nervous system. 
Violent seizures take over. 
Bronchial membranes blister and peel away. 
Death occurs within... 
Stop. 
Now, according to DOD, the Sentox-Six nerve gas stolen from the airport is far more lethal than the gas we just saw used. 
( beeping ) If released in a town or city, for example, the cloud will remain lethal for much longer. 
Are we any closer to finding the canisters? 
There haven't been any reports of progress, sir. 
Excuse me, Mr. President. 
I need to return a call to the State Department. 
Do you have those updates, Walt? 
Yes, here's one from CTU. 
Also one from Homeland Security. 
( phone beeping ) This is Bauer. 
Jack. Mike Novick. 
It's good to hear your voice. 
Yours, too, Mike. 
I'm so sorry about David Palmer. 
I know how much he meant to you. 
Yeah... 
What's going on? 
I have a lead on the stolen nerve gas. 
Isn't CTU coordinating the search? 
This is something I need to bring directly to you. 
I don't understand. 
I can't talk about it on the phone, Mike. 
We need to meet. 
No one can know about this, not even the President. 
I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack. 
You need to give me some idea what this is about. 
It concerns Walt Cummings. 
There's an area a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate. 
It's at the far side of the property from the main house. 
Thanks, Mike. 
I'll see you in 15 minutes. 
Jack... 
Hey. 
They said we can leave soon. 
I know, I heard. 
What about you? 
Are you coming home with us? 
No, I need to stay here. 
CTU still needs my help. 
Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right? 
Yeah, of course. 
Take him downstairs. 
She'll be there soon. 
You're not coming back to us at all, are you? 
No. 
I never thought I was going to be back here at CTU. 
I would never have gotten you involved in all of this, I promise you. 
It's the woman who interviewed me, isn't it? Audrey Raines. 
You were involved with her. 
I could tell by the way you looked at each other. 
I was with her before I had to disappear. 
Are you still in love with her? 
Yes. 
Does she still love you? 
I don't know. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Your transportation's standing by. 
I'll be right there. 
I'm sorry, I have to go. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
( sniffling ) NOVICK'S VOICE: I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack. 
You need to give me some idea what this is about. 
JACK'S VOICE: It concerns Walt Cummings. 
NOVICK'S VOICE: There's an area, a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate. 
It's at the far side of the property from the main house. 
Your man didn't do his job. 
Don't put that on me, Nathanson. 
You were supposed to have Bauer killed hours ago. 
I'm not going to warn you again. 
Pull yourself together. 
You heard the call, didn't you? 
Bauer's coming here to expose my role in all this. 
You're assuming he knows the extent of it. 
Well, it's obvious he knows enough. 
Now, what the hell am I supposed to do? 
At this point, there's only one thing you can do. 
Mrs. Logan, 
please come out of there. 
Mrs. Logan... 
Aaron... 
don't let them take me. 
You've got to listen to me. 
They're just trying to help you. 
No. No. 
They're trying to set me up. 
They're trying to make it look like I had a breakdown, so they can cart me off to some psychiatric hospital. 
Ma'am... 
Aaron... 
It's someone in my husband's administration. 
They're trying to shut me up because I know the truth. 
What truth? 
David Palmer. 
I know... 
( radio static ) Don't let him take me, Aaron. Please? 
We have our orders, Mrs. Logan. 
I'm sorry. 
Aaron... please... 
Aaron... 
Audrey, did you check with the airports? 
Yes. They've all been alerted 
on the missing canisters. 
And CHP? 
Same thing. 
Trucks are being checked at all major interstates. 
Make sure there's no mention of the Sentox nerve gas. 
The White House is clear about that. 
Yes, I know. 
The bulletin only describes the missing canisters. 
There's no mention of chemical weapons. 
Good. The last thing we need 
is for the public to find out that nerve gas is out there. 
( quiet beep ) ( loud beep ) ( clanking ) Schaeffer... 
...what were you 
doing in there? 
Making sure the canisters were secured properly. 
Don't want them knocking around when this gets loaded onto a ship. 
My men secured the canisters according to my instructions. 
You don't need to be concerned. 
All right. 
Here are the customs documents you need when the shipment arrives, along with the remote trigger and the arming codes. 
I'll take the rest of my payment now. 
Our arrangement was you'll get your final installment when the ship left port. 
There's not gonna be a problem. 
They're loading out in less than an hour. 
Then you won't have long to wait. 
Fine. 
Ms. Raines? 
Yes. 
We've been released. 
Oh, good. 
Can I ask you something? 
Of course. 
Do you still have feelings for Jack? 
I'm sorry, but that's personal. 
I know, but he's been living with my son and me for the last six months. 
We started to become a family... 
...and I care about him. 
Do you know he still loves you? 
If you don't love him, let him go. 
( phone rings ) Bauer. 
Jack, it's Audrey. 
What's going on? 
Jack... 
What? 
Audrey, what? 
When this is over, are you coming back? 
I don't know. 
Are you going back to Diane? 
No... 
I don't know what I'm doing yet. 
I haven't had any time to think about it. 
Is it true what she said? 
What'd she say? 
That you still love me. 
I never stopped loving you... 
not for one second. 
Then don't go away again, Jack, please. 
It's more complicated than that. 
I know. 
It's time. 
I gotta go. 
Jack... 
I have to go. 
Yeah, I know, I know. 
Okay. Bye. 
No, no! 
Keep me out of this! 
The last thing I want to do is comment to the press about the roadblocks going up. 
And we can't have any leaks about the nerve gas. 
It would just cause a panic. 
Come in. 
Pardon me, sir. 
We found Mrs. Logan. 
Is she all right? 
She's fine, sir. 
She was hiding in the stables. 
( heavy sigh ) Stables? What the hell 
did she think she was doing? 
Mr. President... 
I feel awkward mentioning this, but... 
Mrs. Logan said 
some things... 
About David Palmer. 
Yes, sir. 
I've heard her conspiracy theories, Aaron. 
I've heard them all. 
But thank you for your concern, Aaron. 
They found my wife. 
Good. 
Mr. President... 
we need to talk. 
What is it, Walt? 
I was hoping to spare you from this, but I'm afraid Jack Bauer is forcing my hand. 
He's on his way here to meet with Mike Novick. 
Bauer? Why? 
He's going to accuse me of helping the terrorists acquire the nerve gas. 
That's ridiculous. 
No, sir. 
It's the truth. 
What did you say? 
Through a proxy, I leaked information to the terrorists about where the nerve gas was hidden. 
You have to understand, sir, this gas was never going to pose a threat to American lives. 
Never pose a threat?! 
People died in the airport! 
Hostages were killed! 
We had hoped to limit the collateral damage. 
"Collateral damage"?! 
What are you thinking? 
This is an unspeakable crime. 
Walt... you have to answer 
for this. 
Mr. President... 
it's in your best interest to hear me out before you make that phone call. 
( slams receiver ) What do you mean "my best interest"? 
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country by separatists who think they are going to use it against the Russians. 
However, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil. 
And you know this how? 
We control the remote detonators on those gas canisters. 
As soon as they reach the terrorists' base, we'll trigger the canisters by satellite and release the gas. 
So everything that happened today was just to kill a some terrorists? 
No, the goal is to produce a smoking gun, proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Central Asia. 
This is unbelievable. 
It's necessary. 
It will finally give us a pretext to increase our military presence in the region, guaranteeing the flow of oil for the next generation. 
How dare you. 
How dare you act without my consent. 
How dare you put this administration this entire country in jeopardy. 
You're a traitor. 
No, no, Mr. President, 
I am a patriot! 
Doing what needs to be done for the continued safety and well-being of this nation! 
My God... 
you gave the order to have David Palmer killed. 
That was an unfortunate but necessary intervention. 
He found out too much and we had... 
Walt! 
You're rationalizing murder, the murder of a president. 
You're going to contact these people and recover the nerve gas before it leaves the country. 
I'm afraid I can't do that. 
Why not? 
I don't know where the nerve gas is. 
And the man I have working inside has gone dark he's unreachable. 
Now, you'll let things play out as they are. 
Otherwise, your administration will be implicated and your presidency will be destroyed. 
Jack. 
Thanks for seeing me like this, Mike. 
What is it? 
Did you tell anyone we were meeting? 
Of course not. 
Son of a bitch! 
Who did you tell? 
Who did you tell?! 
I didn't tell anybody, Jack! 
MAN ( over loudspeaker ): Jack Bauer, stay right where you are. 
Put down your weapons and put your hands up. 
What's the meaning of this?! 
Tell your men to stand down! 
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that. 
He's here at my request! 
We have orders to use force if necessary. 
Orders? From who? 
The President of the United States. 
Get on your knees. 
Thanks. 
Novick and Bauer have been taken into custody. 
So we're just gonna lock Mike Novick up? 
For the time being. 
Well, what good will it do? 
Eventually, he's gonna get out, and he's gonna talk to the press. 
What can he say? 
He doesn't know anything. 
I thought you told me he talked to Jack Bauer. 
We stopped Bauer before he could give Mike any details. 
What's he gonna think? 
We're detaining him. 
Bauer was about to divulge national security secrets that Mike's not authorized to hear. 
That's why Mike's being detained. 
And what about Bauer? 
He must have talked to other people at CTU and told them what he knows. 
As soon as this nerve gas leaves U.S. soil, 
it's gonna be very difficult to prove that either of us is connected to this in any way. 
And you're sure that these-these-these detonators will work, that the Sentox gas will be released before it can be used against the Russians? 
Yes. 
Right now all you need to do is authorize me to terminate CTU's involvement in this matter. 
We'll tell them we've got the situation under control, and that we'll deal with Bauer. 
Who, after all, is not officially affiliated with them any longer. 
All right. 
Good. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
Mr. President, I have 
Mrs. Logan for you. 
Not now. 
Yes, sir. 
Dunley. 
What is Jack Bauer doing here, why is he under arrest, and why wasn't I told? 
Orders of the president. 
Directly? 
No. It came through 
Walt Cummings' office. 
Okay. Thank you. 
We're no longer running point on the search for the canisters. 
We've been ordered off by Division. 
Why? 
The White House wants to use their own people to coordinate from now on. 
That doesn't make sense we'll waste hours getting another agency up to speed. 
Yeah, I know. 
I tried calling the president. 
He's not taking my calls. 
What about Mike Novick? 
Jack should be with him by now. 
Novick's people say he's unreachable, and Jack's cell goes right to voice-mail. 
Something's wrong. 
Yeah, I know, but I don't know what we can do about it. 
I do. 
What? 
We can disregard the order. 
We're not disregarding a presidential order. 
If we don't, we will not find this nerve gas. 
Sending Jack Bauer to have a conversation with Mike Novick as a private citizen is one thing, but I'm not about to start considering disobeying a direct order from the White House. 
That's because you don't have the experience to know any better. 
( soft chuckle ) Mr. Buchanan, 
will you step outside for a moment? 
I can't have you talking to me like that in front of these people. 
You're right. I'm sorry. 
Are we clear about who's in charge here? 
Yeah, but my advice stands. 
If this order jeopardizes our chances of finding that nerve gas, it's your responsibility to ignore it-- at least until we can make our case to the White House. 
You also need to learn to make decisions faster. 
Bill... 
One more thing that comes with experience. 
Lynn, if we don't do everything in our power to stop these terrorists, we're not doing our job. 
( panting ) Okay, disregard the order. 
Thank you. 
EVELYN: Is there anything else you'd like me to pack for you? 
Maybe a few of your... 
nicer dresses? 
I'm being confined to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn. 
I don't think there are gonna be any black-tie events. 
Sorry. 
How'd this happen? 
What's that, Mrs. Logan? 
Charles and me. 
I was his confidante. 
All those years in Congress, my... opinion 
was the one that mattered most to him. 
And now I'm... 
...less than an 
afterthought. 
I'm sure the president would be here if he could. 
He's the President of the United States, Evelyn. 
He can do whatever he wants. 
If he wanted to be here, he would be. 
( zipping suitcase ) ( door opens ) Mr. Bauer, you're being moved 
per the president's orders. 
Where? 
To a class three detention facility. 
On what charges? 
I was invited here by Mike Novick. 
Those are my orders, sir. 
You're Pierce, right? 
Aaron Pierce. You served 
under David Palmer. 
Yes, I did. 
I need to speak with you just for a moment, please. 
That's not possible. 
It concerns David Palmer's killer. 
All right. 
David Palmer was assassinated because he was on the verge of discovering that the terrorists that attacked us today were being helped by someone within Logan's administration. 
Who? 
Walt Cummings. 
Why would Mr. Cummings 
be involved with terrorists? 
I couldn't tell you. 
But I can tell you that the terrorists are now in possession of a weaponized nerve gas, and Walt Cummings may be the last chance we have to stop them in time. 
Walt Cummings ordered the assassination of David Palmer. 
I know that's hard to believe, but I can prove it, it's true. 
Actually, it's not that hard to believe. 
The First Lady also thinks someone in the administration was involved. 
Your primary responsibility as lead agent is to protect the President of the United States. 
Someone in his administration is undermining his authority. 
That is equivalent to a coup d'\tat. 
Agent Pierce, please... 
please, I need your help. 
Bauer's escaped. 
When? I didn't get 
a code alert. 
My comm's down. 
Call it in, have agents cover the west gate that's where he was headed. 
What about you? 
I'll take your post. 
Go. 
Yes, sir. 
That was NSA CTU hasn't transferred the search operation to their jurisdiction yet. 
What's the problem? 
I don't know. 
But you need to call Lynn McGill, make sure we're in charge of this. 
I've been avoiding his calls because he's just gonna ask me why I'm pulling CTU off the search operation, and I don't know what to tell him! 
You don't have to tell him anything. 
You're the president. 
Agent Pierce, we're in the middle of a meeting, if you don't mind. 
Mr. President, 
my name is Jack Bauer, and I'm sorry to have to confront you like this, but your chief of staff is withholding information that is vital to this nation's security. 
( blow lands ) Stop this! 
I'm the President of the United States get your hands off this man! 
Agent Pierce, do something! 
I am, Mr. President. 
I'm upholding my oath to protect you. 
That won't have any effect, sir. 
I've overridden the distress line. 
Mr. Cummings is guilty of 
conspiring with terrorists. 
He facilitated the theft of a military-grade nerve gas, and today is responsible for the death of at least three people, including David Palmer. 
I know about that, but there's an explanation. 
What do you mean, you know about that? 
Mr. Bauer, please, I just 
found out a couple minutes ago. 
It's very complicated. 
I don't know what this man has told you, but we need to find that nerve gas now, and I mean immediately, before it is too late. 
It's already too late. 
What do you mean? 
Apparently, it's on its way out of the country. 
Where is it?! 
He told me he doesn't know! 
He's lying to you, sir! 
The man I have inside has gone dark, I don't know. 
I'm done talking with you, you understand me? 
Now you read my file. 
First thing I'm going to do, I'm going to take out your right eye, then I'm going to move over, and I'm going to take our your left. 
And then I'm going to cut you. 
I'm going to keep cutting you until I get the information that I need, you understand me? 
So for the last time, where is the nerve gas? 
( Cummings grunts ) Stop. 
Stop! Stop! 
I'll tell you! 
I'll tell you! 
( breathlessly ): I'll tell you. 
It's-it's on a freighter leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30. 
JACK: How is it concealed?! 
In a container carrying medical supplies. 
What's the container number? 
I don't know. 
What's the number?! 
I don't know! 
I-I'd tell you, I swear. 
LOGAN: Mr. Bauer! 
( grunting ) I don't know. 
( strained grunting ) ( intercom beeps ) MAN: Mr. Buchanan, I've got 
Jack Bauer on line three. 
Jack, what's going on? 
We've been trying to reach you. 
Bill, hold on. I'm going 
to put you on speakerphone. 
Bill, I'm standing here with the president. 
The nerve gas is at Long Beach Harbor in a container full of medical supplies on a freighter bound for Central Asia. 
It's set to depart at 2:30 p.m. 
How solid is the intel, Jack? 
It came directly from Cummings. 
Mr. President, we've 
been trying to reach you about an order we received changing our jurisdiction. 
Disregard the order. 
Then you want CTU to maintain operational control of the retrieval? 
Yes. Absolutely. 
I'm alerting CBP. 
Get hazmat teams in there and set up a perimeter. 
Have medical teams standing by in case the gas is released. 
Got it. 
Good work, Jack. 
Are you heading back to CTU? 
I don't know yet. 
Jack, we'll let you know when we have more information on the container. 
Copy that. 
Mr. President, Agent Pierce 
and I are prepared to hand ourselves over to the authorities now. 
Aaron. 
Yes, Mr. President? 
Take back your shield and get Walt Cummings out of my sight. 
Yes, sir. 
He told me it was too late, and I believed him. 
You need to understand, I trusted Walt Cummings... 
but he lied to me. 
I was coerced. 
There is, uh, one more thing that we need to discuss. 
What is that, sir? 
You. 
The fact that you're alive presents problems for both of us. 
( softly ): Yes, Mr. President. 
I accomplished what I set out to do, which was to identify and locate David Palmer's killer. 
I would like to stay on until the nerve gas is retrieved. 
After that, I give you my word I will simply disappear again. 
All right. 
I think that would be best for the good of the country. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you, Mr. Bauer. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I'll see you soon. 
( knocks on hood ) Wait. Hold up, Kevin. 
What's happening? 
Martha. 
Charles... 
Come on. Get out 
of the car. 
Be careful. 
What? 
You were right. 
There was a conspiracy. 
David was trying to warn you and warn me. 
I should have listened to you. 
( stammering ): I-I... 
Y-you... you believe me now? 
It was Walt Cummings. 
He lied to me. 
He convinced me that you were out of control. 
Walt?! 
Sending you back to the... the clinic 
in Vermont was his idea. 
And you went along with it. 
I'm sorry, Martha. 
Sending me away without a word... 
like I was... some nuisance 
to be gotten rid of. 
Excuse me, Mr. President, 
but you wanted to know when a link with CTU was established. 
Yes, um... 
thank you, Wendy. 
See that the First Lady's bags get back to her room. 
Of course. 
I've got to go. 
Chloe, do we have confirmation on the intel Jack gave us? 
There's only one ship scheduled to leave the port of Long Beach at 2:30. 
It's a freighter heading for Central Asia, leaving from Pier F. 
We don't have CTU teams in the vicinity, but we've got a Customs and Border Protection task force on site under our directive. 
All right, make sure that CBP understands the nerve gas is housed in 20 canisters of gray metal that are unmarked. 
They're going out in a shipment of medical supplies. 
Yeah, yeah, they know all that already. 
But there's going to be about a thousand cargo containers on that ship, and we don't know which one the nerve gas is in. 
It's container 539146, box seven. 
I was able to hack into the ship's manifest. 
It's the only container stocking medical supplies. 
That's great. 
Make sure all the strike force units have that. 
Right. 
Lynn, the White House is requesting a live feed from the assault. 
We'll have Chloe patch them in once the TAC teams reach the staging area. 
All right, got it. Yeah. 
That's him. 
BUCHANAN ( over speakerphone ): His name is Ivan Erwich. 
He's a chemical engineer trained at the University of St. Petersburg. 
Joined his country's separatist movement six years ago. 
Do we have any clearer images, any file photos? 
No, which is why we need you to I.D. him 
when the strike force has a visual. 
Okay, just make sure that CPB knows that we need to take Erwich alive. 
They know. Stand by. 
What's the situation? 
The strike team is in place, Mr. President. 
We're just waiting for the video feed to come up. 
Feed's up. 
FINN ( over monitor ): CTU, we've located the target container. 
No hostiles present. 
You have the green light, Agent Finn. 
Remember, do not discharge your weapons unless absolutely necessary. 
If a bullet breaches one of those canisters, we'll have a massive casualty situation. 
FINN: Copy that. 
Masks on. 
Go! 
Don't move! 
Put your hands in the air now! 
He's dead. 
Open 'em up. 
Open 'em up. 
Let's go! Open 'em all up. 
This one. 
Empty. Next. 
Moving on, moving on. 
No. 
FINN: Come on, get it open. 
Empty. Next. 
Come on, move it. 
Open it, open it. 
Next. 
Open it, come on, come on. 
What do we got? 
What do we got?! 
Nothing?! 
There are no gas canisters here, CTU. 
Repeat, the nerve gas is not here. 
Get Walt Cummings in here now! 
Yes, sir. 
Damn it! 
The nerve gas isn't there. 
It has to be. 
Where are the canisters?! 
I don't know. 
I-I've told you everything. 
They have to be there. 
Oh, God... 
What is it? 
That's Schaeffer, the man we had inside. 
They must've found out we reprogrammed the detonators. 
( phone ringing ) It's his cell phone, sir. 
Who's calling you? 
That's Schaeffer's number. 
JACK: Bill? 
Yeah, Jack? 
I want you to monitor and record this call. 
We're on it. 
Answer it now. 
Yes? 
ERWICH: We know you've altered the arming codes, Mr. Cummings. 
CUMMINGS: Who is this? 
I think you know my name... 
as I now know yours. 
Your man Schaeffer confessed everything. 
Is President Logan with you? 
The President had nothing to do with this... 
nor did anyone else in the government. 
I was acting alone. 
Do you really expect me to believe that? 
It's the truth. 
Erwich, listen. 
We can negotiate something. 
I don't negotiate with my enemies. 
I eliminate them. 
Your country is about to pay a very steep price. 
Captioning sponsored by 20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION and FORD. 
Built for the road ahead. 
You helped terrorists acquire weaponized nerve gas! 
I told you we were going to trigger the canisters once the separatists reached their base in Central Asia. 
Damn it, Walt, you got into bed with these people and now they're threatening to use the gas on American citizens! 
What do we do about Walt? 
We keep him out of sight long enough for us to construct a credible narrative. 
Are you talking about a cover-up? 
Walt Cummings was complicit in David Palmer's assassination. 
If we go public with Cummings, the credibility of this office will be destroyed. 
Mr. President... 
What is it, Mike? 
 I think you should come here. 
 What's going on? 
Just come here, sir. 
 Lynn? 
 What is it? 
I know you're busy, but I need to see you, please. 
I need you to do some work for us and I'm going to need it done fast. 
Get the canisters! 
You have to cut precisely ten centimeters from the bottom of the casing. 
You and I need a place where we can meet. 
Call you back in five minutes. 
Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated on a provisional basis. 
He's been given full autonomy and access. 
We got a possible intercept on Erwich. 
A man named Jacob Rossler... 
a software programmer indicted for high-security code infiltration. 
Never convicted. 
Copy that. 
Federal agent! 
Rossler is in custody! 
I repeat, Rossler is in custody! 
Answer. 
Yes? 
We have the identification keys. 
No! 
Is he gonna make it? 
No. He's dead. 
Rossler's our only link to those canisters. 
Erwich's gonna call here any minute. 
He's gonna expect to talk to him. 
What's the situation? 
Rossler's dead, shot by his female companion. 
What does that do to our plan? 
We intended to use Rossler to lead us to Erwich and the Sentox. 
How? 
Rossler was going to sell Erwich a chip that would enable him to activate the canisters and release the Sentox. 
And we put a tracker on the chip? 
Yes, to follow Erwich back to the canisters. 
Obviously that plan has to change. 
Has Erwich set a time and place for the meeting yet? 
No. 
We've also picked-up increased chatter related to the canisters. 
Related how? 
Erwich's been putting out feelers to terrorist organizations with sleeper cells established here. 
He's asking for help launching nerve gas attacks on larger targets, across the country. 
There's a call coming in on Rossler's phone. 
We assume it's Erwich. 
What do you want to do? 
Put it on the speaker. 
Jack, this has to be Erwich. 
CTU is on the line. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Five minutes. 
Roof of the parking garage, corner of White Oak and Mattison. 
One of my men will meet you. 
Look for a blue van. 
What do you think? 
I think we caught a break. 
Give me the chip. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
Let me speak to Bill Buchanan. 
Buchanan. 
Bill, did you get that? 
Yes. Erwich is sending someone else 
to the meeting. 
That's a problem. 
No, I don't think so. 
It means I can pass myself off as Rossler. 
We can keep the meeting. 
We can control this thing. 
Rossler and the man Erwich is sending may know each other. 
No, he said: "look for a blue van." 
He wouldn't have said that if they knew each other. 
It's a big risk, Jack. 
Jack, they will probably kill you, even if they do think you're Rossler. 
It ties up a loose end. 
Well, right now, we don't have a choice. 
If we're lucky, this guy will take the chip back to Erwich. 
And that will lead us to the nerve gas. 
All right, Jack. Do it. 
Thank you. 
Chloe, Edgar, Jack is gonna need you to tech support him through the installation of that chip. 
 We'll pull up the schematics. 
 Already on it. 
All  right, the chip you'll be giving them is genuine, but it's useless without the correct unlock code. 
The tracker's built into the chip itself. 
Okay. Thanks. 
How  do you want to play this? 
Passive, nonthreatening. 
I want these people to think I'm scared of them. 
All right, get TAC teams ready. 
We're on the move. 
You'll need a new com unit with fresh battery. 
You'll be patched into CTU at all times. 
With this, we'll be able to hear everything within a 20 foot radius of you. 
I'll be watching your back. 
Thanks. 
Testing, 1, 2, 3. Testing, 1, 2, 3. 
He'll be waiting for you there. 
Let me know if there's a problem. 
Do we have the new chip yet? 
N o. 
I sent Polakov and Komar to meet Rossler. 
They should have it in a few minutes. 
Anything? 
Remote will always be the most effective way of triggering the canisters. 
I understand, but what if the new chip doesn't work? 
I need options in case Rossler fails us. 
There may be a workaround, but someone will have to be on site with the canister. 
Get it done. 
Excuse me, Mr. President, 
I thought you should know, Walt's body has been moved to the Secret Service outbuilding for the time being. 
You realize, sir, we still need to issue a public statement about his death. 
No statement till his wife's been notified. 
Of course. 
Sir, if you don't mind me saying, I think perhaps we have an opportunity here. 
This statement you and Mrs. Logan plan to release... 
disclosing the fact that Walt was part of a conspiracy to supply the terrorists with nerve gas, and that he was involved in David Palmer's assassination... 
What's your point, Mike? 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I wonder if his death might render all that moot. 
Go on. 
Very little will come from dragging Walt's name through the mud when he's not here to answer for what he's done. 
And it would be devastating for this country, particularly if, God forbid, that nerve gas is used against us. 
What are you suggesting? 
We could attribute Walt's suicide to a despondency over the day's events. 
Overwork. 
Personal issues. 
Let him go out with some dignity, you mean, and not as a traitor. 
Yes, sir. 
My wife will have a considerable problem with that. 
Well... I respect 
the First Lady's moral conviction, but this is your decision, not hers. 
Is there anything else I can get you, Mrs. Logan? 
No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine. 
Can I ask your advice on something? 
Of course. 
Some of the staff are asking questions. 
About? 
Walt Cummings' death. 
Evelyn, I'm helping prepare a statement right now that the President's gonna give later. 
It'll explain everything. 
Is there something else, Evelyn? 
Yes. 
What? 
What is it? 
Why did he do it? 
Why did Walt kill himself? 
I deserve to know. 
A violent thing happened to someone that I work with every day, someone who had no visible signs of depression. 
What if it wasn't suicide? 
What if we're in danger? 
I don't know what to think. 
It was suicide. 
How can you be so sure? 
Evelyn, listen to me. 
What I'm going to say to you has to stay in this room until its made public, do you understand? 
You do understand? 
Even his family doesn't know the truth yet. 
Okay. 
Walt Cummings was a traitor. 
What? 
I'm not going to go into any details, but suffice it to say that Walt was responsible for some of the awful things that have happened today. 
I can't believe that. 
The President just found out. 
I suppose that Walt didn't want to face the humiliation of a long public trial and... 
and he decided to kill himself. 
Was he working with the terrorists? 
Our enforcement agencies are trying to figure that out. 
Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point. 
Maintain your distance. 
All right, head's up. 
We have a blue van entering the parking garage, license plate six-Quebec-four n ine-nine-five-one. 
Repeat, six-Quebec-four, nine-nine-five-one. 
Running the plates. 
He's heading up the ramp towards you, Jack. 
Couldn't get a visual on who's inside. 
I have a hit from DMV. 
The plates don't match the vehicle. 
They probably stole the van and put clean plates on it. 
Two men are getting out. 
Show time. 
Rossler? 
I was told there'd only be one of you. 
Is that a problem? 
Yeah... I don't like surprises. 
Relax... we've got your money. 
Let me see it. 
When I see the chip. 
Erwich says you have to install it. 
Where's the remote trigger? 
Let's go. 
Okay, Jack, you need to remove the backing. 
Inside, there are five jumpers. 
Toggle the one in the middle to the left. 
Then pry out the old chip, do it gently. 
When it's out, clear your throat or something. 
Okay, insert the new chip in the slot, press the reset button under it. 
Screw the back on, and you're done. 
The trigger's been reconfigured, you can activate the canisters now. 
You'd better hope it works. 
You're coming with us, just to make sure. 
What are they doing? 
We are on the move. 
This isn't the deal I made with Erwich. 
I reconfigured the trigger... 
you're supposed to just give me the money! 
Standing by to move in. 
Hold on, Curtis. 
Erwich knows who Jack is, he saw him at the airport. 
They'll kill him. 
By the time Jack gets close enough to be recognized, the TAC teams will move in. 
No, we need to move in now, take the 2 terrorists and make them tell us where Erwich is. 
We don't have time. 
Erwich will know something's wrong and we'll lose him. 
This is our only shot. 
Bill?! 
Are we letting them take Jack? 
I'm awaiting orders. 
Stand down, Curtis. 
Take no action. 
Reassemble the TAC teams and mount a follow operation. 
All teams stand by. 
Lynn's right. 
Whatever happens, Jack can handle it. 
He has to. 
Come in. 
Excuse me, Mrs. Logan. 
What is it? 
Laura  Campbell gave me the press release to give to you. 
 I'm confused. 
 About what? 
It's not what you said. 
They're calling Walt Cummings a hero, not a traitor. 
I don't believe this! 
Well? 
Is CTU any closer? 
They're mounting an undercover operation, which they hope will lead them to the canisters. 
Hope is not good enough. 
We want results. 
You need to make that abundantly clear to them, Mike! 
I believe they're doing everything that can be done, sir. 
I just read the statement you issued about Walt's death. 
"Stress due to overwork robbed this country" "of one of its most dedicated public servants. 
"His work with this administration has..." 
You're covering everything up. 
I'll wait outside. 
Don't go anywhere, Mike. 
Your fingerprints are all over this. 
Charles, we worked on this together. 
I thought we'd both agreed that you needed to go public about Walt's involvement with everything that is going on today. 
I know. I know you're disappointed, 
but I think it's obvious that Walt taking his own life changes things. 
What's obvious is that this is a pack of lies! 
Mrs. Logan... 
full disclosure would have been necessary to ensure Walt faced justice for what he'd done. 
With his death making that a non-issue, it was decided this course was best for his family. 
Oh... don't. 
You don't care about his family. 
You decided that this was best for you. 
But, Charles, you are dead wrong... 
Martha, that's enough! 
I made my decision... 
and I am the president. 
Which means it's your job to tell the truth... 
even when it's ugly. 
And if you don't, I will. 
If you feel so strongly about telling the truth, you can start with Walt's wife when she arrives. 
Suzanne's coming here? 
To collect her husband's body. 
So you can be the one to tell her that the real reason that Walt took the coward's way out was because he disgraced himself and he betrayed his country. 
All right. 
It'll be very painful... 
but it's the right thing to do. 
We're one mile behind Jack, heading west on Nordhoff, just passing Sepulveda. 
Maintain your distance. 
We've got them on satellite. 
We're not going to lose them. 
Where are we going? 
What does it matter? 
I have another appointment, I just want to know if I'm going to make it. 
We're almost there. 
How long it takes once we get there is up to you. 
What do you mean? 
I told you. 
We need to make sure the remote trigger works on the canisters. 
Oh, my God, you've got one of the canisters with you. 
Erwich wants a field test. 
I'm not going to be within 50 miles of that thing when it goes off. We have masks. 
What's the target? 
Curtis, are you reading this? 
Yeah. You want me to reposition 
the TAC team for an intercept? 
No! Not till we have a visual 
on the canister. 
If they stay on Nordhoff, up ahead there's an industrial park and two retail complexes. 
They just turned north. 
That's not good. 
What is it, Chloe, what's the potential target? 
The Sunrise Hills Mall. 
Curtis, the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall. 
Repeat, the intended target is the Sunrise Hills Mall. 
Uploading schematics of the mall, surrounding streets, to TAC teams now. 
All right, all teams stand by for positioning. 
We're setting up at the second level of the parking structure. 
This is it. 
Curtis? 
Do you have Jack on visual? 
Yeah. He and the two hostiles 
are in the south parking lot. 
Alpha Team, take the position on the perimeter of the lot. 
Bravo Team, I want your plainclothes agents in position at the mall doors. 
How are you going to get the canister inside? 
Through the front door. 
Anyone asks, we're working on the air-conditioning. 
I didn't agree to this. 
I'm not going in. 
Yes,  you are. 
Jack is trying to stall for time. 
What are we waiting for? 
There are hundreds of video cameras in there. 
This entire country will know what we look like in the next few hours. 
We want your leaders to know who did this to them. 
This is your fight. 
The deal I made with Erwich was to sell him the chip, not to get my face all over the news. 
Erwich prefers to keep you alive, but only if you cooperate. 
Now, hand me the jackets. 
Jack, we're moving the TAC teams in to recover the canister before you go inside the mall. 
Fine, let's get this over with. 
I'll let you know as soon as we're in position. 
Sending redeployment orders now. 
Hold off on that. 
What? Lynn?! 
We have got to stop them before they get inside. 
If we move in now, Erwich will know that we're onto him, and we won't be led to the other canisters. 
Are you talking about letting them go through with this? 
Sacrificing the lives of all those people? 
We're talking about accepting the damage that one canister can do, versus what the other 19 can do. 
This is insane. 
Bill?! 
Bill's not in charge here, I am! 
We need to call the President. 
I just got into the mall's internal video surveillance server. 
We should be able to see Jack. 
Jack, we're still waiting for the President to call. 
I'll let you know as soon as we have him. 
Can we go to the ice-cream shop selling up those Sunday bars? 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
I need flavors you like, I'll bring out the sauces... 
I'll be right back. 
Get the security guard. 
Knock on the glass. 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 Servicing the HVAC units. 
We didn't get a call about that. 
I don't know what to tell you. We did. 
You got paperwork? 
Just a minute. 
Will this work? 
Yeah. 
Do it. 
Throw me the bag. 
And your jacket. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
the president is on line one. 
Put him through. 
Jack, we have the President on the line. 
I'm gonna patch you in. 
Go head? 
Mr. President, this is Lynn McGill. 
You also have Bill Buchanan, Audrey Raines, Chloe O'Brian, and Edgar Stiles in the room. 
Go ahead. 
Sir, we're calling you for a decision on a critical operational matter. 
What is it? 
Jack Bauer is currently undercover with some of the terrorists. 
They're expecting Jack to help them release a single canister of Sentox nerve gas in the Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall where they are right now Well, then arrest them. 
What's the problem? 
Sir, the problem is, if we don't maintain Jack's cover, there's no guarantee that they'll lead us back to the other 19 canisters. 
Do you mean actually let them release the Sentox? 
Are you out of your mind?! 
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan. 
I had the same initial reaction. 
Then I looked at our updated scenarios. 
With the help of other terrorist organizations, the remaining 19 canisters could be deployed at other, more crowded public areas, such as subway stations, hospitals and sports arenas, sir. 
The loss of life could exceed hundreds of thousands of people. 
My God. 
Bring it over here. 
What kind of casualties are you predicting at the mall? 
We don't have exact numbers, but based on our video surveillance, our best guess is between eight and nine hundred. 
Sir, many of them are children. 
Can't you evacuate the mall? 
Not without the terrorists knowing. 
The public will not tolerate the government's complicity in this. 
They wouldn't know, sir. 
This would be a covert decision. 
We are monitoring the terrorists. 
We know at 100% that when they'll leave the mall, they are going back to the remaining canisters. 
What's your recommendation? 
Bill Buchanan and I agree that the greatest good would be served by allowing them to release this single canister of Sentox nerve gas. 
And I believe, sir, that we have no right to sanction the deaths of innocent people. 
We should take our chances, interrogate these men, and find the location of the other canisters. 
Are we ready? 
Almost. 
Mr. President, 
we're running out of time. 
We need your decision, sir. 
This is a field operation. 
It's up to you. 
With all due respect, Mr. President, 
it's not. 
We don't have the legal authority to make this decision, only you do. 
You're putting me in a terrible position. 
Hold on. 
Mike? 
CTU has laid out the facts well. 
But you have to make the call. 
All right. 
The terrorists are forcing us to make a tragic choice. 
I'll go along with your assessment. 
Let them release the Sentox. 
But you better find those other canisters or those people will have died in vain. 
Pull our TAC teams out of the mall. 
Jack, you heard the president's decision. 
Let's go. 
Put your masks on. 
Go and arm the valve. 
What's the unlock code? 
Jack, the unlock code is alpha-kilo-charlie. 
I repeat, alpha-kilo-charlie. 
Come on! 
What's the unlock code?! 
Alpha-kilo-charlie. 
Echo-bravo-charlie. 
Enter the correct code, Jack. 
That's an order. 
Jack, this is a direct order from the president! 
Now enter the correct code, let them release the gas! 
Now! 
It's not arming the canister. 
Why isn't it working? 
Maybe the remote's been damaged. 
Make it work or I'll kill you. 
There's nothing I can do. 
Make it work! 
I told you there's nothing I can do! 
Jack, can you hear me? 
Yes? 
We can't arm the canisters! 
What is the problem? 
Rossler says he doesn't know. 
 Do you believe him? 
 I don't know. 
Should I kill him? 
Not until we are sure we have another way to release the gas. 
Andrei thinks he's discovered an alternative. 
I'll put him on. 
Get him in the other room. 
Polakov. 
What's going on? 
Andrei thinks he may have another way to release the gas. 
Now move the jumper over. 
Expose the red and yellow wire. 
Hang on, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone. 
Are you sure the valve can't open without warning? 
If you make a mistake, it could, so pay attention. 
Five more splices to go. 
Which one now? 
The orange wire next to... 
Exactly as before. 
The white wire and the blue wire, connect them directly to the socket and to the release valve itself. 
Get the masks. 
We're almost ready. 
Lynn, there is still time to move in and stop them before they murder all those people. 
Audrey, we have a directive from the president. 
The president's not looking at these children whose death warrant he just signed. 
Don't you realize how many more people could die if these men don't lead us to the other 19 canisters? 
They could. 
That's theoretical right now. 
Those children will die within minutes! 
Look at them. Look at the monitors! 
 Audrey, that's enough. 
 No, it's not. 
Tell me, if you were in Jack's shoes, could you follow through with that order, stand by and watch as they murder all those people? 
This is war. 
There are going to be casualties. 
And if those are orders of the president, yes! 
I would have to. 
I hope that's not true. 
For your sake. 
Got two more wires to go. 
All right, the wires are together. 
Put your mask on. 
Next pair you splice will open the valve. 
Go kill Rossler. 
Polakov. 
Polakov! Polakov! 
Jack, can you hear me? 
What's happening, Jack? 
What's your status? 
I've managed to stop the flow of gas, but some got into the air system. 
We need to evacuate the mall, now. 
What about the terrorists? 
One's dead, one escaped. 
Have Curtis and his men start looking for them. 
Curtis, this is Buchanan. 
Move in, now. About time. Move in! 
Move in! All teams, move in! 
You! Against the wall! 
I'm a federal agent. 
Terrorists have released a toxic substance into the air system. 
You need to evacuate people now. 
This is not a joke. 
This is not a robbery or a drill... do it now! 
Uh, we have a red alert. 
Begin evacuation procedures immediately! 
Where is the power source for the air system? 
It's next to the food court. 
The control room door's right there. 
Get everybody out now! 
Proceed to the nearest mall exit in an orderly fashion. 
A mall evacuation is in progress. 
I repeat: the mall is being evacuated. 
Everyone inside the building must proceed to the nearest exit as quickly and as safely as possible. 
Curtis, do you copy? 
Yeah, Jack, we're closing in on the mall. 
I'm going to try and shut down the air system in the mall. 
I do not have a visual on the hostile. 
Make sure your men take him alive. 
Understood. 
Curtis, it's Jack. 
The Sentox that escaped has managed to stay in the food court. 
We've got at least 11 people down. 
I need assistance. 
I need assistance now! 
Got it. 
Sweetheart, can you hear me? 
I want you to hold the mask. 
when I take it off, okay? 
Here you go. 
All right, everyone, masks on. 
Inject anyone who's down. 
Get them outside as soon as possible. 
I need a shot of atropine for a child under 12! 
Curtis, give me that jacket for her head. 
I'm losing her! 
Come on. 
She's responding. 
Her pulse is stabilizing. 
Jack, we've secured the exits. 
We don't have a visual on the other terrorist. 
If he got out of the mall before we locked down, he may be lost. 
And our only remaining chance of finding Erwich. 
Monitor the tracking device in the remote trigger. 
The hostile that escaped still had it on him. 
Chloe? 
Jack's right: the signal's moving away from the mall. 
Looks like he's on foot. 
Michaels. 
Jack and I are going after the remote trigger. 
You're in charge here. 
Report directly to Bill Buchanan. 
Walsh, gather your team. You're with us. 
Don't be scared. 
You're gonna be all right. 
This man's going to take care of you. 
Yes. 
Rossler... or whoever he was... 
killed Komar and tried to stop us. 
What are you talking about? Why? 
I don't know! 
I managed to activate the valve before I got away. 
At least some of the gas was released in the mall. 
You sure you're not being followed? 
Yes. 
What do you want me to do? 
Come back. 
I'll be there soon. 
He's turning left on Reese. 
We're six blocks out. 
Hold on, Mr. McGill. 
I'll connect you to the President. 
Yes. 
Mr. President, I know this is 
not what your order stipulated. 
That's why I thought I had to let you know what was happening. 
What's happening is I sent you over there to make sure CTU was running smoothly in a time of crisis, and you seem to be incapable doing that. 
Sir, Bauer refused the order. 
There was nothing I could do. 
No. I don't want excuses. 
Just do your job. 
And if you can't do it, I'll find somebody else who can. 
The estimates from the mall are much lower than we originally anticipated. 
It appears the fatalities will be limited to between 10 and 20 people. 
Thank God. 
So, what are we telling the media? 
Nothing yet. 
CTU is maintaining a blackout on the ground there until we give them direction on a cover story. 
What about the other 19 canisters? 
CTU has a terrorist under surveillance as we speak. 
They believe there's a good chance he'll lead them to Erwich and the rest of the canisters. 
All right, good. 
There's something else, sir. 
Suzanne Cummings has arrived to claim Walt's body. 
Martha is on her way to speak with her now. 
Thank you, Mike. 
Suzanne. 
Hi, honey. 
I can't believe he's gone. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm so, so sorry. 
I should have been with him today. 
 Don't do this. 
 I wanted to be. 
Honey, don't, don't do that. 
Don't blame yourself. 
You know how much we love you, honey. 
And no matter what you need, we'll always be here for you. 
I just don't understand. 
This doesn't make any sense. 
You were with him today. 
Why, Martha, why in the world would... Walt do this? 
Suzanne... 
Walt... 
loved this country. 
And he loved you. 
I'm sorry. 
I think I need a moment. 
Of course. All right. 
He's slowing down. He's stopping. 
Cross-referencing with the street grid. 
He's in front of 1136 East Muldauer. 
Bill, we're going to have to hit him hard and fast, to try and stop him from releasing any more Sentox from the canisters. 
Agreed. 
Set up a perimeter and begin your approach. 
All right, teams, we're moving in. 
Put your gas masks on. 
Team B, take the front entrance off the street. 
We're taking the side. 
Go now. Go. 
Yes. 
You were followed. 
I don't know how. 
It doesn't matter. 
You know what to do. 
Yes. 
No! 
Hostile down! I repeat! 
Hostile down! 
Erwich's gone! 
Curtis, have your men call in now. 
Team A, Team B, report. 
Come on, guys. What do you got? 
There's nobody here. 
Place is empty. 
Erwich is gone. The canisters are gone. 
We've got nothing here! 
Damn it! 
Transcript: Raceman Suggestions, critics, insults: 24subs@gmail.com 
BIERKO: We release the Sentox here and 200,000 people die. 
We need access to the control room. 
CHLOE: Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute. 
JACK: If we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated. 
JACK: Bierko! 
Give me a hand. 
Organize an escort team. 
You get him back to CTU alive. 
You got it. 
I just word from the FAA about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight. 
So, what? 
Jack Bauer is the hijacker. 
GRAHAM: What was he doing on that flight? 
Looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer's death. 
Order the plane down and grab Bauer before he can hurt us. 
We need to take him down now, dead or alive. 
Mr. President? 
I don't care if Bauer's making threats or not, that plane has to land immediately. 
And when it lands, I want my secret service detail to take him into custody. 
Sit down! 
He has a gun! 
Everybody just stay in your seats! 
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt! 
Captain, this I Jack Bauer. 
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel. 
The person that I'm looking for, the man with the evidence that I need, is sitting next to you. 
He's your copilot, Scott Evans. 
JACK ( over headset ): You need to open the door. 
Could you, uh, take the stick for a second? 
( captain grunts ) ( struggling ) I'm the only one who can fly this plane now! 
Give me the recording. 
Advise CTU I have the recording. 
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes. 
Bauer's got the evidence. 
He is in control of the plane. 
What do we do? 
You are going to have to shoot down that plane, Mr. President. 
Otherwise, you'll go to prison for treason and murder. 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: Sierra Tango, cleared to flight level 2-2-0, report reaching. 
5-2-0, Sierra Tango descend to flight level 2-2-0. 
We can expect the approach to Van Nuys. 
Good. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
Can you patch me through to Karen Hayes? 
( over phone ): Hold please. 
I'm bleeding. 
I think you broke my nose. 
You'll get medical attention as soon as we're on the ground. 
Right now, your only concern should be flying this plane. 
( over intercom ): Miss Hayes, I've got Jack Bauer on line one. 
Put him through. 
Yes, Jack? 
I've got the recording. 
It was on the copilot. 
The copilot? 
Yeah, he was working for Henderson. 
The captain's unconscious, but I've secured the copilot. 
We're en route back to Van Nuys airfield. 
What's our ETA? 
21 minutes. 
We're going to be on the ground in 21 minutes. 
Karen, listen to me. 
This recording proves that President Logan was complicit in David Palmer's assassination. 
It's imperative that we do not let it fall into the hands of anyone that is loyal to the president. 
As soon as we're on the ground, I'm going to need you to provide me with a safe corridor back to CTU. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
I'm back here with Karen. 
I'll explain everything later. 
We can dispatch a team to meet you at the airfield. 
They can head off any law enforcement, take you into protective custody. 
Okay, good. 
Bill, how is Audrey? 
Curtis just brought her in. 
She's in Medical getting treated, but it looks like she's going to be okay. 
Thank God. 
Okay, I'll get back to you as soon as we're on final approach. 
All right. 
Audrey. 
I just got off the phone with County General. 
I have some great news. 
Your father survived the crash. 
He's alive? 
Yeah, one of our teams picked him up about 30 minutes ago at the accident site. 
He's still in ICU, but they expect him to pull through. 
Oh, my God. 
We have a team stationed at the hospital. 
He'll be well-protected. 
Thank you. 
( phone rings ) I have to take this. 
Curtis? 
Thank you so much. 
You're welcome. 
This is Manning. 
Is Henderson secured? 
He's in Holding Room Three. 
Good. 
I need you to take a team to pick up Jack. 
Where is he? 
He's on a plane heading towards the Van Nuys airport. 
ETA is 20 minutes. 
Why is he on a plane? 
He had to commandeer the plane in order to secure the evidence against President Logan. 
I'll brief you with the details en route. 
Curtis, I cannot emphasize strongly enough the explosive nature of the evidence that Jack is carrying. 
I need you to put him into protective custody and bring him back here to CTU. 
Understood. 
President Logan will probably send his men to retrieve it. 
You've got to get to Jack first. 
We will. I'm heading out. 
( phone rings ) Yes? 
We have a solution that will allow you to order the plane shot down. 
I sure as hell hope so. 
I may be the president, but there are protocols in place that I can't just ignore. 
What we're proposing will circumvent your protocols. 
What is it? 
We're going to simulate a VCI distress signal. 
It'll be broadcast on the airplane's transponder code, and it will appear to come from Bauer's flight. 
Hold on. What is 
a VCI distress signal? 
It's an emergency signal indicating that there's a hijacking in progress, and that the perpetrators intend to use the aircraft as a weapon. 
It'll give you the pretext to shoot it down. 
There really is no other legitimate response to this scenario, Mr. President. 
All you need to do is appear to struggle with the ethics and then give the order. 
Mr. President? 
Fine. 
All right. 
You sound reluctant. 
I can't believe it's come to this. 
I'm going to shoot down a plane full of innocent people. 
None of us is happy about this, Mr. President, 
but you don't really have a choice. 
Bauer has evidence implicating you in this conspiracy, and I don't have to tell you what the consequences will be for all of us if it's released. 
We should contact Chloe and bring her in. 
We're going to want her help bringing Jack back to CTU. 
HAYES: Fine. 
Send an escort. 
Karen, I appreciate this. 
I know you're putting everything on the line to help us. 
All I can say is this recording better be everything Jack claims it is. 
I know Jack. 
I don't always agree with his methods, but I trust his judgment. 
I'll go make that call. 
What's going on? 
What's Buchanan doing out of Holding? 
The situation has changed, Miles. 
There's some new intel. 
I haven't seen anything. 
What new intel? 
I don't have time to explain it right now. 
What does that mean? 
It means that I'll brief you when I've got the chance. 
Have you compiled the orders for Bierko's transfer? 
I'm still working on them. 
Let me know when you've got them. 
What is it, Mike? 
A situation has come up regarding the hijacked plane. 
Tell me what's happening. 
The FAA just picked up a VCI distress code. 
It originated from flight ST-520. 
What's a VCI distress code? 
The VCI is a coding system that was recently installed on all commercial airliners. 
This particular code indicates that a hijacking is underway, and that the plane is going to be used to target installations on the ground. 
Oh, my God. 
Admiral Kirkland is standing by on video-conference from Point Mugu. 
He's ready to brief you with the details. 
Admiral Kirkland, I'm Mike Novick. 
I have the President here. 
Mr. President. 
Admiral. Mike's told me 
about this VCI signal. 
How could it have been sent without Bauer's knowledge? 
Most likely, one of the pilots under duress secretly activated the transponder code. 
Let me get this straight. 
At last report, Bauer was in the passenger cabin. 
Does this mean that he's now in the cockpit and that he's in control of the plane? 
It appears that way, sir. 
( sighs ) What do we do, Admiral? 
Sir, the protocols for this scenario are clearly specified. 
We're compelled to take preemptive action. 
What action? 
The aircraft must be shot down. 
We've already scrambled an F-18 out of Point Mugu. 
We just need your approval to engage. 
There are over 50 people on that plane, Admiral. 
We have to think of the people on the ground, Mr. President. 
Over 20 million citizens live in Los Angeles County, each one of them is now a potential target. 
I don't believe this. 
Mr. President, if 
I can interject. 
Admiral, it's hard for me to accept that Bauer intends to use the aircraft as a weapon against civilians. 
From my briefing document, Jack Bauer is a distraught individual with a history of erratic behavior. 
Jack Bauer has spent his entire career protecting American lives. 
I think there's a reason he's doing what he's doing. 
What would that be? 
I don't have the answer, but we should at least try to find out. 
We don't have the time. 
Mr. President, we 
could have the F-18 shadow the aircraft. 
We could issue a standing order to fire only if the target deviates from its present course. 
That's not a viable option, Mr. President. 
Why not? 
Right now, that plane is over the desert. 
In another 15 minutes, it'll be above Los Angeles. 
If we're forced to shoot it down then, there'll be facing massive casualties on the ground. 
And, Mr. President, 
we must also consider the possibility that Bauer intends to attack the Presidential Retreat. 
The Retreat? 
You're inside the target zone, and Bauer's already been accused of killing one president today. 
The simple fact is, sir, we don't know what his intentions are. 
Mr. President... 
Mike. Stop. 
I've made my decision. 
Admiral, I'm authorizing you to shoot down that plane. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. President... 
Mike, please. 
Don't make this any more difficult for me than it already is. 
Miss Hayes. 
This just came in over the interagency sub-net. 
BUCHANAN: What is it? 
We have to alert Jack. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, air traffic control just received a VCI distress signal from your aircraft. 
That effectively authorizes President Logan to shoot you down. 
Shoot us down? 
BUCHANAN: And F-18's been scrambled out of Point Mugu, Jack. 
You have eight to ten minutes at best. 
Can you patch me through to the pilot of the F-18? 
No chance. 
They're on a coded frequency. 
We can try to get in touch with the White House. 
And tell them what? 
They don't want to hear anything I have to say. 
Hold on. 
We need to land this plane now. 
We're 100 miles from the nearest airport. 
They just scrambled an F-18 to shoot us out of the sky. 
We need to get on the ground now! 
You didn't hear me. 
There's nowhere to land. 
How much runway do you need? 
At least 5,000 feet. 
Bill, do you hear me? 
Yeah, Jack. 
I need you to look for a stretch of freeway 5,000 feet long, straight enough for us to land on. 
I'll pull up maps in the area, Jack. 
It'll take a few seconds. 
Get back to me as soon as you've got something. 
We can't land on the freeway. 
Yes, we can. 
It's late, there's a curfew. 
There won't be any cars on the freeway. 
Cuff your right hand to the flight control, now. 
All the way. 
Start taking us down. 
Do it now. 
What's Chloe O'Brian doing here? 
I don't know. 
You can go. 
What's going on? 
An F-18's been scrambled to shoot down Jack's plane. 
Can you open up a socket with the ATC radar tracking plot? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Do it, Chloe. 
We need to know the exact amount of time Jack has before the fighter plane reaches him. 
Okay. 
Karen, look at this. 
Two possible landing sites. 
I think this one's the best shot. 
I agree. 
Let's get Jack on the phone. 
I need to speak with you. 
We need to make an emergency landing. 
Talk to your passengers and get them ready. 
What's happening? 
Don't worry. 
Everything's gonna be fine. 
Just get them ready. 
Okay. 
Listen up, everybody. 
We're going to prepare for an emergency landing. 
The proper procedure... 
It's Bauer. 
Jack, it's Bill, I think we found something. 
Bill, hold on one sec. 
I want to put you on speakerphone. 
Go ahead. 
It's a stretch of the 118 freeway between mile marker 91 and 92. 
There's about 4,000 feet, then there's an overpass. 
That's not long enough. 
It's the best we can do. 
Copy that, Bill. 
Hold on, give me a second. 
You can either try and land this plane on the freeway or I will. 
Give me the coordinates. 
3-4-5-0.2 north 
by 1-1-0-3-0.4 west. 
We need to know where that F-18 is. 
Jack, it's Chloe. 
I'm working on it. 
CURTIS: Manning. 
We have the exact location where Jack's putting down. 
Go ahead. 
It's the 118 freeway between mile markers 91 and 92. 
He should be on the ground within minutes. 
Copy. We're redirecting. 
118 freeway. 
Copy. 
Mr. President, 
we're five minutes away. 
I'm patching us in directly with the pilot of the F-18. 
Go ahead. 
KIRKLAND: Bravo One, this is Admiral Kirkland. 
You're on with the president and myself. 
Report status. 
My radar is locked onto the target. 
Target is in a steep descent. 
Maintaining radar lock-on. 
Okay, I've got the ATC radar plot. 
Put it on the main screen. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, the F-18 is within 15 miles. 
They're not gonna make it. 
He's gonna be within the missile range in two minutes. 
You're not descending fast enough. 
If we increase the descent rate, we won't be able to pull out of the dive. 
If we don't get on the ground before that F-18 reaches us, it's not gonna matter. Descend now! 
( people screaming ) SUE: Put the oxygen masks on! 
PILOT: Target has increased angle and rate of descent. 
One minute from missile lock. 
Jack, they're almost within weapons range. 
The aircraft can't take this. 
I have to pull up. 
Not yet! 
I can see the freeway! 
Come on. 
Okay, level up now! Now! 
We can't pull out of the dive! 
I need your help! Pull! 
( alarm sounding ) Ground proximity alert. 
20 seconds to missile lock. 
Target's at 1,000 feet and leveling. 
Leveling? 
PILOT: Affirmative, sir. 
What does that mean? 
Target may be preparing to land. 
The objective seems to be the 118 freeway. 
Lower the landing gear! 
We're going too fast! 
Lower it! 
He's lowering his landing gear. 
The F-18's in range. 
I have missile lock. 
KIRKLAND: The aircraft is in a landing profile, sir. 
I recommend we abort. 
What? 
The parameters have changed, sir. 
I want that plane shot down! 
Sir... 
Order your man to fire, now! 
Mr. President! 
Admiral Kirkland is right. 
The aircraft's not a threat. 
There's no reason to do this. 
I implore you to reconsider. 
Abort. 
Yes, sir. 
But if they don't land, I want you to shoot that plane down immediately! 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Bravo One, hold fire. 
I repeat, hold fire. 
Copy, base. 
Bravo One holding fire. 
We have Marine units deployed in the area. 
I want them to cordon off the landing site and apprehend Jack Bauer. 
Yes, sir. 
500 feet! 
We're not gonna make it. 
Come on. 
CTU. 
We've spotted the plane. 
They're coming in for a landing. 
We're heading towards them now. 
I'm handing the controls back to you! 
Touch it down! 
We're still going too fast! 
Touch it down! 
( people screaming ) Target has touched down. 
I'm clear. 
Returning to base. 
Bill, we made it. 
We're down on the ground. 
Jack, we've redirected Curtis to your location. 
He should be there in a few minutes. 
I'm just east of the Balboa overpass. 
Have him meet me there. 
Send a secondary team to pick up the copilot and EMTs for the pilot. 
Got it. 
Get out of there, Jack! 
Everyone, keep moving to the rear of the plane! 
Exit from the rear, now! 
You should have followed through, Mr. President. 
You should have ordered that pilot to fire. 
They were landing on a freeway. 
I had no pretext to shoot them down. 
I had to abort. 
It's going to be much harder to contain now, if not impossible. 
Bauer's on the ground. 
He won't get far. 
Even before the plane touched down, I ordered two battalions of Marines into the area. 
They're cordoning off the landing site, even as we speak. 
Bauer... 
has nowhere to run. 
I hope you're right, Mr. President. 
This is our last chance. 
If Bauer gets through... 
I know. 
I know what's at stake, Graham. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news. 
( sirens wailing ) ( garbled radio transmission ) ( cell phone rings ) Yeah. 
Curtis, it's Jack! 
Go ahead. 
The Marines are moving in. 
They're setting up a perimeter. 
Where are you? 
We're approaching your position from the north. 
Okay, I got you. 
I'll meet you on the north side of the freeway. 
( garbled radio transmission ) They know I'm still in the area. 
We got to get out of here. 
Head south on Variel. Move. 
Damn it. 
You're gonna have to try and talk your way through the roadblock. 
Get your hands up! 
Hands where we can see them. 
We're federal agents. 
Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit. 
We've been given orders to detain everybody inside this perimeter. 
We're all on the same team here, Commander. 
We're trying to apprehend the suspect who hijacked that plane. 
Jack Bauer? 
That's right. 
Now, let us do our job. 
I need to see individual ID's. 
I'm gonna call this in. 
We don't have time for this, Commander. 
The longer we sit here, the better chance Bauer has of slipping through the net. 
This will only take a few minutes. 
A few minutes is all Bauer needs to escape. 
We're not prepared to let that happen. 
Now we're moving out. 
If you really want to fire on federal agents, that's your call. 
Stand down. 
Move out. 
Stand down! 
Head east for a while, then turn south. 
Yes, sir. 
Buchanan. 
It's Curtis. 
We've got Jack, and we're headed back in. 
Okay, Curtis. 
Marines are all over the place. 
Barely got past one of the patrols. 
They must be taking direct orders from Logan. 
There's no other explanation. 
We can't take the chance of running into any more of these patrols. 
We'll stick to the back streets. 
Understood. 
( phone rings ) Hayes. 
MILES: I want to know what's going on. 
Miles, I told you I would tell you when I felt the time was right. 
I'm sitting here watching you work with two people under arrest for aiding and abetting a federal fugitive. 
If you don't talk to me, I'll have to get my answers somewhere else. 
I'll be right there. 
You can't tell him. 
I can't hold him off any longer. 
You really think that's a good idea? 
I have to trust him. 
He's been nothing but loyal. 
I probably shouldn't have kept him in the dark this long. 
I'll be right back. 
I don't appreciate being threatened, Miles. 
And I don't appreciate being shut out. 
We've worked a lot of years together, Karen, and I have never wavered in my allegiance. 
I don't deserve this. 
No, you don't. 
Come with me. 
Jack Bauer's acquired evidence implicating President Logan in David Palmer's death. 
Have you seen this evidence? 
No, but Bauer's bringing it here now. 
What is it? 
It's a recording of a conversation between the president and an accomplice. 
But you haven't heard it? 
No. 
And that's what you're doing with Buchanan and O'Brian? 
Covertly helping Bauer? 
Yes. 
For the past three hours, President Logan has done everything in his power to keep Jack from getting back here alive. 
You're working against the most powerful man in the world, and you haven't actually heard the evidence. 
This is why I didn't talk to you, Miles. 
Because you knew I'd talk you out of it. 
Yes, I know what I'm doing is risky. 
If I am wrong, my career is over. 
I could be brought up on charges. 
Not just your career, Karen. 
I am doing this because I believe that Bauer is telling the truth. 
But you don't know. 
Okay, okay. 
Let's say he is. 
Let's say that recording implicates Logan. 
Then what are you going to do? 
Are you going to arrest the President of the United States? 
That will be up to the attorney general. 
You're depending on... 
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
Yes. 
They're ready to move Bierko. 
Thank you. 
I'll be right out. 
Look, I have to go over the transfer protocols. 
I know that what I'm asking from you is difficult. 
Everything rests with what's on that recording. 
Tell me what you need. 
Bauer will be here any minute. 
The best way for you to help me is to go back out there and keep things running smoothly. 
All right. 
Miles? 
It's imperative this stay between us. 
Of course. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
We have a full tactical complement, enhanced ordinance package, two vehicle escort. 
Vladimir Bierko, you're being transferred to a primary holding facility at our district headquarters. 
Let me know the second he arrives. 
Understood. Let's move out. 
Where the hell is Mike Novick? 
SECRETARY: He's moments away, sir. 
You told me that three minutes ago. 
Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
I was on the phone with Colonel Owens. 
He's the Marine field commander on the site. 
Is Bauer in custody? 
No, sir. 
What happened? 
As ordered, the Marines sealed off a one-mile radius around the landing site. 
They've completed a sweep of the area. 
And? 
And it's Colonel Owens' estimation that Bauer is no longer inside the perimeter. 
He got away. 
It appears so, sir. 
I can't believe this. 
Uh, Mr. President, 
it's only a matter of time before Bauer's apprehended. 
Sir, are you all right? 
Thank you, Mike. 
I need some time alone now. 
( door closes ) ( phone ringing ) ( phone continues ringing ) ( phone ringing ) Jack, the attorney general's on his way to his office right now. 
He'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes. 
Okay, good. 
Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback. 
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature so that we can establish a chain of evidence. 
Okay. 
You need to work alone. 
I don't want anyone else near that recording. 
You don't ever let it out of your sight. 
I won't. 
You said I had ten minutes. 
I'd like to see Audrey. 
Of course. 
She's in Medical. 
Thank you. 
Well, when will I be able to speak with him? 
All right, I understand. 
Well, just let him know... 
Can you please tell him that his daughter called and that... 
she loves him very much. 
Thank you. 
It looks like my dad's gonna be all right. 
Yeah, I know, I heard. 
Oh, God, I'm so glad to see you. 
Me, too. 
We did it. 
We got the evidence. 
Oh. 
The attorney general's going to hear it. 
So it's over? 
Yeah. 
President Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination. 
Thank you. 
Close your eyes. 
I'm going to sit with you for a minute. 
( phone rings ) Yes. 
LOGAN: Graham. 
I've been trying to reach you. 
I know. 
Bauer slipped through the cordon, didn't he? 
Yes. 
I've just been told that the attorney general's office received a phone call from the director of CTU. 
I think it's fairly obvious they're in possession of the recording. 
I think that phone call was about you. 
I didn't expect it would to happen so soon. 
I am sorry, Charles. 
You don't deserve this. 
Listen, Graham, despite how things turned out... 
...I still believe that 
we were in the right. 
I still believe that we acted in the best interest of the country. 
And we have to keep putting the country's well-being ahead of our own. 
The spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating. 
Yes. Yes, it would. 
Aside from the psychological damage to the country, a trial would expose certain realities that should never see the light of day. 
If only we could keep such a trial from taking place. 
That thought occurred to me, as well. 
I'm glad we agree. 
I want you to know I've taken steps to ensure that you and your associates won't be implicated in any of this. 
I appreciate that, Charles. 
We all do. 
There's nothing more to say. 
I'm going to hang up now. 
There are, uh, a few things I'd like to take care of before... 
Good-bye, Charles. 
Good-bye, Graham. 
Martha, may I come in? 
Now you want to talk? 
Marti, please? 
What do you want? 
Is there something else you want to confess? 
No. 
I want to tell you how sorry I am... 
for everything. 
When you forget to give me something for my birthday, that's when you say you're sorry. 
I know what I did was wrong. 
It was horribly wrong and unforgivable. 
I know that. 
But what I can't live with is the fact that I hurt you. 
That's the last thing I wanted to do. 
Marti? 
Marti, please. 
That's the truth. 
The truth. 
( sniffles ) You know what really gets me, Charles? 
What? 
That you had me going for so long. 
I had no idea you were such a good liar. 
If I wasn't so horrified by the fact that I'm married to you, I might actually be impressed. 
( sighs ) * * * * ( phone ringing ) Yes. 
SECRETARY: I have an urgent call for you, sir. 
He says his name is Miles Papazian from CTU. 
I don't want to talk to anyone from CTU. 
He insists that you'll want to speak to him. 
He says it's about Jack Bauer. 
Put him through. 
You're on with the President. 
MILES: Mr. President? 
Yes, go ahead. 
You don't know me; my name is Miles Papazian. 
I work under Karen Hayes. 
What is this about? 
It's about a recording, sir, that Jack Bauer has just delivered here to CTU. 
Sir, my understanding is it's a recording of a conversation of yours that, if leaked, could significantly compromise national security. 
Go on. 
My superior, Ms. Hayes, 
is working with Bauer and Bill Buchanan. 
Their intention is to play the recording for the attorney general. 
Why are you telling me this? 
Because, sir... 
I feel compelled to intervene. 
And I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve. 
I do, Mr. Papazian, 
I do approve. 
Listen, I'm going to text you... 
my private number. 
Let me know how it goes. 
And, Miles... 
...I promise you, 
I won't forget this. 
Thank you, sir. 
That's all I wanted to hear. 
Mr. President, I look forward 
to speaking with you again soon. 
* * Karen wants to know how long before the teleconference starts? 
Five minutes get out of here, Miles. 
We'll be ready? 
Not if you keep interrupting me. 
I'm just doing my job, Chloe. 
Well, if your job is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work. 
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready. 
Thanks. 
Now, why would David Palmer call my wife about a national security threat? 
Can't risk having Mrs. Logan 
obsess about this phone call. 
David Palmer called her yesterday. 
Our communications office will have a recording of their conversation. 
Get that for me. 
You don't need to be concerned that there's any connection between David's death and the phone call he made to you. 
He said it was a matter of national security. 
Those were his exact words. 
Martha, it's David Palmer. 
I need to talk to you. 
It's hardly a matter of national security... 
No, that's not what he said. 
That is not what he said! 
Yes, it is. 
CUMMINGS: I have dealt with the Martha Logan situation. 
I was able to alter the tape of the phone call before the president heard it. 
There's no longer any evidence on my end that Palmer was trying to warn her about the attack. 
Sir, it's Edgar. 
I think we can find Chloe. 
She's accessing our system through a laptop. 
I'm running a locate now. 
What'd you get for me on Chevensky? 
He's a baggage supervisor at the airport. 
Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian! 
We know you're down here! 
( tires squealing ) JENNINGS: Don't fire! 
Do not fire! 
Chloe, what the hell's going on? 
Jack didn't kill anybody. 
He's being framed to cover up the real reason Palmer was assassinated. 
Where is he? 
I can't tell you. 
Where can I find the baggage claim supervisor? 
Down that hall to the left. 
Chevensky! 
Why was President Palmer killed? 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
You are going to tell me what I want to know. 
It's just a question of how much you want it to hurt. 
Mom, do you see those men? 
I have to tell Jack. 
Derek, where are you going? 
Come back here! 
( gasps ) No! 
Quiet! 
Quiet! 
You will not be harmed as long as your president complies with our wishes! 
( sirens wailing ) We have a critical incident in progress! 
I want a facility lock down and a code five evac, right now! 
Clear the area! Ma'am... 
Officer... 
Officer, my son is in there. 
I'm sorry, ma'am. 
We're evacuating the area. 
Follow these people. 
Ma'am! 
Grab her! 
I have to get my son! 
( crying ) Sorry, lady. 
I'm sorry, you can't stay. 
I have information for CTU! 
Please! 
My son! 
BERESCH: Everyone, quiet! 
Quiet! 
If you cooperate, you have a chance of leaving this building alive. 
If not, you will die. 
Do you understand? 
Take out all cell phones and pagers and drop them on the floor. 
( boy crying ) We're going to be okay. 
We're going to be okay... 
Bring them in. 
GUNMAN 1: Everyone up. 
Move it. 
GUNMAN 2: Let's go! 
GUNMAN 3: Chevensky? 
Chevensky? 
( phone rings ) Yeah. 
Well? 
Chevensky's not here. 
We have to find him. 
Keep searching. 
( line disconnects ) ( sirens wailing outside ) ( garbled radio transmission ) ( phone rings ) McClaren. 
BERESCH: Listen very carefully. 
We have hostages. 
If you wish to keep them alive, you'll make no attempt to re-enter the terminal. 
I'm listening. 
We are wearing explosive vests. 
We are prepared to detonate ourselves along with our captives. 
If you make any efforts to enter the terminal, you will spend the rest of the day collecting body parts. 
Hello? 
Set up a security perimeter. 
We'll operate from the northwest apron behind hangar 12 and get those fire trucks out of here! 
Everybody out! 
Claremont, grab that woman in the yellow next to Bailey. 
Bring her up here. Quick! 
All right. 
Yeah. Thank you. 
Bill, I just spoke to the director of Secret Service. 
Now that Suvarov has arrived safely, they're lowering their security level by one. 
I think we should do the same. 
I'll take our Tac Teams off standby. 
Have we heard back from our unit that was sent out to the refinery? 
Yeah. At least that part 
of Chloe's story checked out. 
So it's possible that Jack was set up in Palmer's assassination. 
We can't assume too much. 
Jack still has a lot to answer for. 
( phone rings ) Buchanan. 
MAN: Mr. Buchanan, I've got 
Jack Bauer on the line. 
Put it through. 
Bill, put it on speaker phone. 
Please. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
Bill, I'm in Ontario Airport. 
Gunman have just attacked and taken over Terminal One. 
They are carrying automatic weapons and they have hostages. 
We haven't received any alerts. 
Trust me. You will. 
What are you doing at the airport, Jack? 
I was following up a lead. 
President Palmer knew of the planned attack. 
I believe that's why he was assassinated. 
We just received an interagency flash. 
There's been an attack on Ontario Airport. 
First reports are of several men carrying automatic weapons and they've taken control of Terminal One. 
Go to alert level four. 
Launch all available Tac Teams. 
Curtis is in the air. 
Redirect him to the airport. 
Have him maintain operational control the moment he's on site. 
Right. 
Jack, we just received confirmation of the situation. 
I want you out of there now, Jack. 
Turn yourself in. 
Let our people handle this. 
Understand this, Bill. 
I don't work for you. 
I'm staying inside. 
You want my intel, fine. 
How many hostiles are there? 
Approximately 15 to 20. 
What's your situation? 
Gunmen have locked down the terminal. 
Heads down! 
I'm going to be sending you photos of the hostiles. 
They should be clear enough that you can identify them. 
Hold on. 
Okay, they're transmitting. 
All right, Jack. 
We'll pull a schematic of the airport and forward it to your cell. 
Bill, hold on. 
One more thing. 
A woman is going to contact you. 
Her name is Diane Huxley. 
I sent her and her son to CTU for protection. 
Who are they? 
I don't have time to explain, but I'm responsible for them. 
Just make sure they're safe, okay? 
We'll take care of them, Jack. 
Thank you. 
I'll be standing by. 
We have to alert the president. 
Right. 
I'd like to personally extend my condolences on the loss your country has suffered today. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I hope that what you and I accomplish here today will serve as a fitting tribute to David Palmer's legacy. 
I can't imagine anything more appropriate than the two of us establishing a... a comprehensive 
antiterrorism alliance between our nations. 
If you would excuse me for a moment, Mr. President. 
Of course. 
What's up, Mike? 
Terrorists are controlling the main terminal of Ontario Airport in Los Angeles. 
Terrorists?! 
Yes, sir. There are 
eyewitness reports of two casualties and they've taken hostages. 
Who are they? 
Unclear. 
CTU Los Angeles is prepping a briefing. 
Mr. President. 
I suggest we move to the Situation Room. 
Now?! 
CTU thinks this may be related to the summit. 
Related in what way? 
I don't know, sir, but we'll find out during the briefing. 
Sir? 
We should go. 
Of course. 
Mr. President, as you've 
probably been made aware, a situation has developed that requires my immediate attention. 
I have just been informed. 
This is terrible news, indeed. 
Please let me know if there is anything I can do. 
I will. Thank you, sir. 
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen. 
Spencer? 
Pulling the ground plan of the terminal off the NTSB server and sending it to Jack Bauer now. 
Good. Edgar. 
Were you able to identify the terrorists from the photos Jack sent? 
Still no matches on the watch list. 
I tried three different encoding arrays. 
Did you try widening the parameters? 
If it was any wider, we could use the phone book. 
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second. 
Try using NP-safe adaptive search. 
You okay? 
Thanks for asking, Edgar. 
Chloe... 
you managed to rack up four protocol violations. 
Well, it's a lot worse than that if you count agency doc codes. 
It's more like 26 violations. 
Do you want me to figure out whose face that is? 
Or I could just go wait in holding. 
See what you can do. 
Did it work? 
We got something. 
It's off an archive from the Bureau of Consular Affairs. 
Anton Beresch, a former army officer in one of the Russian breakaway republics. 
BUCHANAN: Which means this definitely has something to do with the summit. 
I'll data-mine the interagency servers, see what I can come up with. 
DOD is receiving a localized broadcast from the airport. 
The networks are also picking it up. 
Spenser, put it on screen. 
...citizens 
of the United States, today your president and the president of Russia have come together to sign what they have called an "historical accord," an "antiterrorism alliance." 
BERESCH: Your leaders claim it will bring peace and security to their respective countries. 
As you'll soon learn, it'll accomplish exactly the opposite. 
I have hostages. 
Unless President Logan and President Suvarov make a joint statement repudiating this accord, I will order their execution. 
You have exactly 90 minutes. 
We have to get this lunatic off the air. 
Sir, we can contact the networks, but they're under no legal obligation to comply. 
BERESCH: We take these actions with the full knowledge that we will be called butchers, but we are only responding to the violence that has been inflicted upon our own sons and daughters. 
Until we as a people achieve our own due national sovereignty terror will be met with terror. 
NEWSMAN: That was a live feed from the Ontario Airport in Southern California. 
As we just heard, the terrorists are demanding that President Logan repudiate the antiterrorism accord. 
This is insane. 
How did these people get control of an entire airport?! 
We've been preparing for this summit for 16 months! 
Every news agency in the world is here! 
I-I've staked my entire administration on this day, and now these people are demanding that I go on national television and publicly repudiate everything we've done? 
Mr. President, 
perhaps you should take a few moments... 
Mike! 
I want this handled! 
Do you understand? 
I don't care how you do it, I don't care what it takes fix it! 
Go ahead. 
Curtis, this is Jack. 
I'm staring straight down on the main concourse. 
I've got six hostiles wearing explosive vests. 
Four of them are staying near the hostages. 
I expect their orders are to detonate if we try and make a move; the other two are roaming. 
I've got two security doors on the northeast side of the concourse both are chained, but currently unguarded. 
All right, get a recon unit over to the northeast wall. 
All right, Jack, I'm gonna need you to quarterback this thing from inside. 
Copy that. 
Hey, I got a woman, Diane Huxley, says she has info for CTU. 
CURTIS: Diane Huxley. Who is she? 
Curtis, did you just say Diane Huxley? 
Yes, I did. 
Is she there? 
Yeah. 
Let me speak to her. 
I'll bring her over. 
Hello? 
Diane, what's going on? 
What's wrong? 
Derek is inside the terminal. 
What are you talking about? 
I left him with you. 
He saw some men; he wanted to warn you. 
I tried to go after him. 
There was an explosion. 
Are you sure he made it all the way inside? 
I don't know. 
Hold on. 
Damn it! 
I see him. 
He's with the other hostages. 
But he's not hurt. 
Please don't let anything happen to him. 
Jack, I can't lose my son. 
Diane, listen to me. 
I promise you on my life, I am gonna get Derek back to you. 
Do you understand me? 
Okay. 
Let me speak to Curtis. 
Okay. 
Jack. 
Hey, Curtis, I need to ask you a favor. 
I want you to let Ms. Huxley 
stay with you at the command post. 
You got it. 
I need you to let me know if the hostiles adjust their profile in any way. 
Copy that. 
I'll get back to you. 
Son of a bitch! 
His name is Anton Beresch. 
He's a member of the Dawn Brigade, a separatist movement blamed for numerous terrorist bombings in Russia. 
Precisely the kind of terrorist organization today's accord was designed to combat. 
Bill, I have no intention of calling off this signing, much less making a public statement to that effect. 
So that gives you less than 90 minutes to rescue the hostages. 
We're already operating under that timetable, sir. 
We have a unit on the ground, and we're making an on-site assessment. 
Spare the agency patter; just get it done. 
Sir, you need to be aware, we should be prepared to accept additional civilian casualties. 
More casualties? 
It's a possibility we have to face, sir. 
I'm not prepared to accept any such thing. 
Bill, it's your job to make sure those people get out of there alive. 
Mr. President, the terrorists 
are wearing explosive vests. 
They've threatened to detonate themselves and the hostages if any attempt is made to retake the terminal. 
I'm aware of the situation. 
Bill, have you tried initiating a dialogue with the terrorists? 
Yes, what about talking to them? 
Have you tried that? 
Beresch placed a call to an Airport Police sergeant it was a blocked number, but we're in the process of back-tracing it. 
Look, whatever you do, just make sure it's done by the deadline. 
When I put my name on that accord, I do not want to be signing the death warrant of innocent American citizens. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Do you have that number? 
Yes, sir. 
We just completed the back-trace. 
Try it. 
( woman crying ) ( phone ringing ) It's gonna be okay. 
It's gonna be okay. 
( ringing continues ) Yes? 
This is Bill Buchanan, a director of the Los Angeles Counter-Terrorist Unit. 
I am listening. 
The president has authorized me to speak on his behalf. 
I'm hoping we can resolve this peacefully. 
I've told you how to resolve this peacefully. 
Your president must make a public statement. 
I know he's considering that option. 
Then we have nothing more to speak about. 
There must be some other way we can address your demands. 
I don't think you understand just how serious we are. 
Wait. We can talk about... 
( line disconnects ) Data-mine the call. 
Yes, sir. 
Get up! 
Up! 
What? 
Bring him. 
Curtis, they're moving one of the hostages. 
On your knees! 
Oh, my God. 
Please... 
I have a wife. 
So do I. 
No. 
( people screaming ) * * You! 
No. 
Curtis, they're moving another one of the hostages. 
I can't see where. 
I'm changing position. 
Derek? 
Ma'am, please, ma'am. 
That's my son. 
Ma'am, please. 
They're gonna kill my son! 
( weeping ): That's my son! 
Derek! 
No, let me go! 
( Diane screaming ) In 15 minutes, your president will get another demonstration of our commitment. 
15 minutes. 
I'm in position. 
How much longer till you're ready to move in? 
At least a half hour. 
We're still transferring personnel from the summit. 
Negative. That's too long. 
You need to advance your attack. 
We can't. 
We're just not ready. 
Curtis, they're gonna kill that kid. 
Jack... 
I heard that woman Diane's side of the conversation... 
This has nothing to do with her. 
These people are gonna continue to kill hostages until the summit deadline. 
We can't risk the lives of all those hostages for this one kid. 
You know that. 
I not gonna jeopardize the mission. 
Just tell your men to hurry. 
It's all connected. 
Maybe that's enough, Mrs. Logan. 
The doctor said you really shouldn't be watching this... 
Evelyn... 
David Palmer called me last night. 
He said he had something to tell me. 
It was "a matter of national security." 
I think it has something to do with this. 
The terrorists? 
Yes. I tried to tell my husband 
and Walt Cummings, but they think I imagined the call. 
So we checked the phone recordings. 
The conversations don't match. 
Someone altered the conversation, Evelyn. 
Who would do something like that? 
I don't know. 
Now listen to me. 
You have got to cover for me. 
No one can know that I am gone. 
Do you understand me? 
W-Where are you going? 
( sighs ) ( phone dialing ) ( phone rings ) O'Brian. 
Chloe, is that you? 
Jack? 
What's going on? 
Why are you answering the phone? 
Mr. Buchanan 
needed my help with the airport crisis. 
Are you alone? 
Yeah. 
Okay, I'm going to send a picture of one of the hostiles over to your screen. Hold on. 
Okay, I got it. 
I want you to enlarge the upper right corner of his vest. 
Looks like a secondary detonator, cell phone activated. 
Yeah, so the leader can set off the charges individually in case anybody gets cold feet. 
I need the detonation frequency. 
Okay, I'll have to I.D. the detonator. 
It could take some time. 
Just get started. 
Did you clear this with Buchanan? 
No. 
Chloe, can you see the live feed? 
Oh, my God. It's Derek. 
I need your help. 
Okay. I'll get back to you. 
( sighs ) Spenser... 
I was really worried about you. 
Uh, not now. 
I need you to reconfigure Jack's phone to emit an alternate signal. 
What for? 
Could you just work up a procedure? 
This is off protocol, isn't it? 
Yes. 
Spenser, you have more knowledge about bandwidth processing than anyone here. 
I need you. 
( computer keys clacking ) Got it? 
Yeah. 
( knocking ) It's Agent Pierce. 
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan 
to the Garden Room. 
She's still not ready. 
President Logan is expecting her 15 minutes before the ceremony. 
Could I speak with her? 
What's going on? 
She's in one of her moods. 
If you push her, it'll make it worse. 
I'll wait out here. 
Thanks. 
( door closes ) ( liquid flowing ) It's Mr. Burk, 
isn't it? 
Uh, Mrs. Logan... 
You work in the communications office, don't you? 
Yes, Ma'am. 
I know that all phone conversations are recorded. 
Where do they keep those recordings? 
Uh, well, the calls are recorded onto a hard drive. 
It's part of the central server. 
Is there, by any chance, any hard copies? 
Actually, the-the President insists on written transcripts as backups. 
He's-he's kind of old-fashioned that way. 
I know. Where do they store 
those transcripts? 
Archive room down the hall. 
Can you show me? 
Access is restricted. 
I'm the First Lady. 
I understand, Mrs. Logan, 
uh, but there are security requirements. 
You... you have to have 
an entry card. 
Do you have one? 
Well, yes, I do... 
Can I borrow it? 
It's extremely important. 
Mrs. Logan, I'm sorry. 
Um... there's-there's 
nothing I can do. 
Mr. Burk... 
we can continue this little dance if you really want to, but you and I both know I am going to get into that room, so you can save us both the trouble and just give me your entry card. 
Mrs. Logan, you wouldn't... 
You know, in three seconds, Mr. Burk, 
I am going to scream louder than any woman you've ever heard in your life. 
One... two... 
Here's the card. Here. 
Um... 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, they're going to kill Derek in less than three minutes I need that frequency. 
We're still trying to find the manufacturer of the detonator. 
Hurry. We're 
running out of time. 
I know, but if we don't get the frequency right, we could accidentally detonate all the vests. 
Okay, there's no match on any of the Czech military components. 
That leaves the German manufacturers. 
Jack, we're trying to narrow it down. 
Now, the first team will enter through the southeast door and split into two flanks. 
The primary kill shots will take out the hostiles wearing bomb vests. 
Second team enters through the southeast door, forms a protective ring around the hostages. 
We'll only have a few seconds to neutralize the hostiles, so find your targets fast. 
Go. 
What's your time frame? 
We're on target to launch the assault in 15 minutes. 
Understood. 
( sniffling and panting ) How old are you? 
Fifteen. 
BERESCH: Try to control your breathing. 
Slow down. 
( quiets ) See? 
Better. 
Please don't kill me. 
That's up to your president. 
( phone rings ) Bill Buchanan. 
MAN: Beresch is calling from the airport, sir. 
This is Bill Buchanan. 
The boy hasn't long to live. 
We're haven't heard from the president yet. 
We need more time. 
No. 
The president must announce the summit is canceled, or I kill the boy. 
We're doing our best to get an answer from the president. 
I implore you to resolve this without further killing. 
This boy's blood will be on his hands. 
Come on, Chloe. 
Jack, we just got a match on the manufacturer. 
We're trying to figure out the frequency. 
There's no match on the 2004 series. 
It's got to be one of these three. 
Hold him! 
Agent Manning! 
I got it. 
Here it is. 
We've got the trigger frequency for the detonator. 
Go to submenu three on your phone. 
I'm at submenu. 
Enter this code: 6-3-3-9. 
JACK: Now what? 
The phone needs to reboot. 
When it does, it'll give you a ready message. 
Then you press the star key, and it should send the signal to set off the detonator. 
Your president has abandoned you. 
I'm not getting a ready message signal. 
It takes time to re-flash the ROM. 
Son of a bitch, come on! 
I'm sorry. 
( erratic panting ) I got it. I got it! 
( loud explosion ) Curtis, what was that? 
CURTIS: There was an explosion in the terminal. 
We can't tell what it is from here. 
Patch me through to Jack. 
Stay in position! 
Keep the hostages together! 
Check the exits, make sure the perimeter's secure! 
It was Ibrim's vest. 
It must have detonated by accident. 
Jack, what's going on? 
One of the terrorists' vests blew up. 
But none of the hostages were hurt. 
BUCHANAN: Were you responsible for that, Jack? 
Jack, answer me. 
Bill, they were going to kill another hostage. 
I didn't have a choice. 
I didn't compromise my position. 
Now you tell me this. 
Are Curtis and his team on schedule? 
Yes. The backup units 
are in position. 
Go time is ten minutes. 
Okay. 
BERESCH: Everyone. 
Fall into formation "B" and run circuit checks on your vests. 
The terrorists are revising their formation. 
I'll contact Curtis in the next few minutes with final positions. 
BUCHANAN: Thanks, Jack. 
( beeping ) EDGAR: Mr. Buchanan, President Logan's 
on the line for you. 
Mr. President. 
The news is saying there was some kind of explosion inside the terminal. 
Everything is under control, sir. 
Our tactical units are in position. 
Go time is ten minutes. 
Then what caused the explosion? 
Well, we're not entirely certain, sir. 
We believe that our man inside may have been trying to stall the execution of a hostage. 
He triggered the bomb vest of a hostile. 
Did you authorize this action? 
No, sir, he acted independently. 
You should know, Mr. President, the man 
we're talking about is Jack Bauer. 
Jack Bauer? 
He was in the terminal when the terrorists attacked. 
He's been helping us coordinate our operation from inside, sir. 
I thought that Jack Bauer assassinated David Palmer. 
There's mitigating evidence to suggest that Bauer may have been framed, Mr. President. 
What evidence? 
What are you talking about? 
It's complicated, Mr. President. 
Why am I only hearing about this now? 
I didn't want to distract you with details that could wait until after we'd resolved this hostage situation, sir. 
You tell me everything and I will decide which details are relevant. 
With respect, Mr. President, 
we don't have time. 
Then talk faster. 
PIERCE: Mrs. Logan is due 
in the Garden Room right now. 
Open the door, please. 
Just a few more minutes! 
Ma'am, it's my job to make sure she's there. 
If you don't open the door, I will open it myself. 
Mrs. Logan. 
How dare you barge in here. 
Mrs. Logan. 
This is a private residence... 
Evelyn, if something happens to Mrs. Logan, 
the blame will fall on you. 
We both know that. 
So I am urging you in the strongest possible terms to tell me where she is. 
We're moving to entry positions. 
Davies, Matthews, are your teams in place? 
MAN: All teams in place and ready to go, Agent Manning. 
All right. Copy. 
Go. 
Oh my God... 
It's okay. 
Listen, listen. 
Derek's alive. 
He's okay. 
Are you sure? 
I can't go into details, but he's okay. 
I have to go. 
We're mounting our rescue operation. 
Thank you. 
Keep an eye on her. 
Let's go. 
They're waiting for you in the Garden Room, Mrs. Logan. 
( sighs ) I can get up myself. 
All right. 
But you still need to come with me. 
( sighs ) Whatever you say, Aaron. 
Whatever you say. 
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Logan... 
It's all right. 
I'm really sorry. 
Evelyn, will you stop apologizing? 
It's annoying. 
Besides, I got what I came for. 
NATHANSON: Yes. 
You have a problem at the terminal. 
Explain. 
Jack Bauer is inside providing recon for CTU's rescue operation, which will launch shortly. 
Are you sure? 
This came straight from the Director of CTU. 
And Bauer was responsible for detonating the vest of one of Beresch's men. 
Can you tell me Bauer's precise location? 
No. 
But I know he has a connection to one of the hostages a 15-year-old boy named Derek Huxley. 
I have to go. 
Tell them that's being handled out of the press office. 
Thank you. 
Yes? 
Mrs. Logan is back in her room, 
getting ready. 
Why the delay? 
She was in one of the archive rooms. 
Archive rooms... 
What was she doing there? 
The First Lady is safe and accounted for. 
You'll need to ask her about anything beyond that. 
Thank you, Aaron. 
C.T. 
Go to the ticket counters. 
Go to the west exit. 
Manning. 
JACK: Curtis, this is Jack. 
Beresch's redeployed six men. 
Are you ready for final positions? 
Go ahead. 
Four men were deployed to the east side of the terminal in front of the ticket counter, the other two to the west side of the terminal in front of the emergency exits. 
Do you copy? 
Copy. 
Okay, once you deploy, I'll give you real-time updates on their positions. 
All right, Jack. 
I'm starting the countdown. 
All teams stand by to execute. 
This is it. 
NATHANSON: He's in the terminal now. 
Okay. 
Hostages up! 
Hold on one second. 
Hold on. 
Hold on, Beresch is changing something. 
He's moving... 
( loud electronic distortion and static ) Jack? Jack! 
Curtis, what happened? 
I lost Jack. 
What do you mean, you lost him? 
The connection's broken. 
Can you reconnect? 
I'm trying. 
Jack Bauer. 
Derek is a very brave young man. 
I will shoot him in the head if you don't show yourself immediately. 
( sighs ) BUCHANAN: Curtis! 
It's not going through, Bill. 
Can you move in without him? 
The last thing Jack said was that Beresch was moving something. 
He could be moving the hostages into the kill zone. 
Abort. 
All teams, abort the operation. 
Repeat: This is an abort. 
BERESCH: Bauer, if you want to save the boy, present yourself now. 
Mr. Bauer! 
Derek has five seconds left to live. 
Four. 
Three... 
JACK: Beresch! 
JACK: I'm lowering my weapon. 
Secure him. 
( crying ) Your wife survived the attack. 
Thank God. 
LOGAN: I should never have given in. 
I should have ordered back the motorcade. 
The terrorist attack failed. 
We have to assume they'll make good on their threat to use the Sentox nerve gas on American soil. 
Listen, I-I made a mistake. 
I didn't think that I had any choice. 
MARTHA: You didn't stand up to them. 
You saved my life. 
You're welcome. 
Country's lucky to have men like you. 
I'm lucky. 
Mrs. Logan? 
Christopher Henderson was responsible for setting up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox. 
He left me for dead. 
BUCHANAN: Right now, Henderson is our primary link. 
JACK: You are going to tell me now how to find the rest of the nerve gas. 
Do it, Jack. 
Get it done. 
Shoot me. 
( gunshot ) ( screaming ) Oh, you son of a bitch. 
I shot her above the kneecap. 
She can still walk. 
Son of a bitch. 
You make me shoot her again, she'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. 
Tell him what he wants to know. 
I can't. 
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson into CTU. 
I'm sorry... 
I need an interrogation room prepped. 
I don't care that you took my wallet. 
I just need to get my keycard back. 
It's of no value to you. 
It just lets me in and out of this building. 
JENNY: Okay, you told me we were just going to take his cash and a credit card. 
That's how I'm getting us all this money. 
$20,000 line of credit right here. 
Who's going to pay you that kind of money? 
( gunshot ) ( screams ) ( gunshot ) I have the keycard. 
BIERKO: How long will it take for you to reprogram it? 
Five minutes, and then we will be able to use it to access CTU. 
Good. 
* * * * BIERKO: Yes. 
I'm reprogramming the CTU keycard right now. 
Will it work? 
I need to change the ID, but preserve McGill's executive entry privileges. 
It won't be a problem. 
Good. 
Our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets. 
They'll be in place soon. 
When are you launching your attacks? 
After you're done at CTU. 
I'm a few minutes out. 
Call me when you're there. 
Understood. 
( beeps ) ( keyboard clicking ) BUCHANAN: We were able to neutralize the attack on the hospital, sir. 
Good. 
Do we have any idea what the terrorists' next target might be? 
We're working with federal and state authorities to harden security around the highest-value targets in Los Angeles. 
In other words, no. 
We're completely in the dark. 
We're just sitting around, waiting for Bierko to hit us again. 
We do have one promising lead, sir. 
Jack Bauer was able to recapture the man who escaped, Christopher Henderson. 
Henderson was a defense contractor who brokered the sale of the nerve gas to Bierko. 
Is this the same Christopher Henderson who worked at CTU? 
Yes, sir. He was head 
of Field Ops, until Jack brought him down on corruption charges. 
And this Henderson knows how to find Bierko? 
We believe so, but he's not cooperating. 
Jack's bringing him in for further interrogation. 
Keep me posted on any progress. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
Tony Almeida's been asking to see you down in the Clinic. 
I don't have time right now. 
Tell him I'll get to him as soon as I can. 
And, Ms. Raines. 
Kim Bauer is here. 
She's just clearing Security. 
Put her in the Field Ops Office, please. 
Yes, ma'am. 
BUCHANAN: What's Kim Bauer doing here? 
Jack asked me to call her. 
Does she know? 
Not yet. 
Who's with her? 
I don't know, but I'll find out from Security. 
Excuse me. 
( touch tone beeping ) ( phone ringing ) This is Bauer. 
Hey, it's me. 
Is Burke prepped for the medical interrogation? 
Yes. 
Jack, Kim just arrived at CTU. 
What did you say to her? 
Nothing yet. 
Good. I want her 
to hear it from me. 
Jack, it might be easier for her if she knows that you're alive before she sees you. 
When I first saw you... 
It's-it's just... 
Yeah, I know. 
I-I... I understand. 
Look, when you talk to her, just explain that the reason why I couldn't tell her I was still alive was 'cause I was trying to protect her. 
Of course, I will. 
Audrey, thank you. 
Kim's at CTU right now. 
You know, after you died, Chase left her, and she hit bottom. 
Did you know that? 
It's only right now she's putting her life back together. 
Or maybe you did know that, but you just couldn't do anything about it, huh? 
This doesn't concern you. 
Oh, I think it concerns me, Jack. 
Miriam and I were there for Kim when you weren't. 
Whatever you think of me, we love that girl. 
Are you okay? 
( sighs ) Both my parents died here. 
I swore I'd never come back to this place. 
Well, we can leave right now if you want. 
Here, she's coming. 
Kim. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
This is Barry Landes. 
Hi. 
Audrey Raines. 
So, what is it? 
What did you have to tell me that was so important? 
I-I think it would be better if we talked in private. 
Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of Barry. 
Kim, I really think that that this... 
No, no, it's-it's okay. 
It's about your father. 
What about my father? 
He's alive. 
Kim, he wanted to tell you, but he couldn't, in order to protect you. 
Someone inside the government wanted your father dead, so he staged his own death and went underground. 
He knew that you wouldn't be safe if he told you that he was alive. 
I didn't know either until this morning. 
I thought maybe if I told you now before you saw him, it might be a little bit easier. 
He's on his way in now to CTU. 
Hello, Mike. 
Mr. Vice President. 
I thought you were in Salt Lake City today. 
Hal canceled his engagements to be here, Mike. 
I think you'll agree we need all hands on deck to deal with this Sentox situation. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
Okay. 
So, what's on your mind, Hal? 
Mr. President, 
when these terrorists attack, you're going to need to maintain order. 
And I submit to you, the plan you're implementing with CTU is inadequate. 
Sir, it was drawn up after a careful study for an attack of just this magnitude. 
CTU is already coordinating with first responders. 
Fine, and they should still do so. 
But what I'm proposing is something far more sweeping. 
And I believe it's warranted by the facts. 
Andrew? 
begin with, I'm revising all of CTU's casualty estimates, based on the assumption that the terrorists will hit all of these high-profile targets: hospitals, malls, sporting arenas, transit hubs. 
My low estimate is 400,000 casualties. 
NOVICK: Now, that's a considerable upward revision. 
I'd like to know how you reached it. 
Well, you're free to talk to my working group. 
You know, frankly, I believe that there are a lot of people who don't take this threat seriously enough. 
I assure you we're taking it very seriously. 
We have no agenda but to do so. 
Considering these revised numbers, what's your recommendation? 
Well, I believe you should be thinking of a preemptive declaration of martial law in the greater Los Angeles area. 
NOVICK: Mr. President, 
martial law is appropriate only as a last-ditch measure, not as a preemptive one. 
Go on. 
Every study we've done has shown it would incite more unrest, not less. 
And you couldn't do it without approval from Congress. 
Which is why we won't call it martial law. 
No one is going to play semantics here when we're putting troops on the street to try to keep people from killing each other. 
You're talking about a panic that hasn't happened. 
Right now, the public isn't even aware of a threat. 
You declare martial law, you'll have to tell them. 
How long would it take to deploy the troops? 
I've already been in touch with the Pentagon. 
National Guard and Army units are on standby, pending your decision. 
Mr. President, I-I agree 
there's a case to be made, but for God's sake, let's make it to Congress. 
We can declare an emergency session... 
We don't have time, Mike. 
Hal is right. 
This-This attack could take place any minute. 
If CTU can't find this man Bierko, we're going to get hit. 
It would be smart to have control of the streets. 
This is a mistake, Jack. 
You don't want to do this. 
Get out. 
I'll get immediate immunity if I talk. 
You know it, and I know it. 
And I'm not even going to ask for it. 
Damn it, Jack. 
Will you listen to me? 
I'm not trying to protect myself. 
I'm trying to protect this country. 
What do you mean? 
You don't want to know what I know. 
You get me to talk, I promise you you'll just be opening Pandora's box. 
Tell me, and let me judge that for myself. 
That's what I thought. 
BURKE: I'll set him up in Holding. 
Let me know when he's ready for interrogation. 
Yes, sir. 
Jack. 
Keycard, please. 
Oh. All clear, sir. 
Yeah. 
Okay, well, thanks. 
That was Curtis; he's on his way back from the hospital. 
Okay, good. 
Audrey. 
Did you speak to Kim? 
Yes. 
What was her reaction? 
She's a little confused. 
You should also know that she's here with someone. 
I think it might be her boyfriend. 
His name is Barry Landes. 
Where is she? 
She's in the Field Ops Office. 
Okay, thanks. 
Yeah. 
Hey. 
I don't know what to say. 
I don't know what you expect me to say. 
You don't have to say anything. 
Why didn't you just tell me you were alive? 
I couldn't. 
If you knew I was alive, you would have been at risk. 
I had no choice. 
You could have chosen to trust her. 
I'd like to speak with my daughter alone, please. 
I don't think that's a good idea. 
I don't care what you think. 
I'm sure you don't. 
All that matters is you, and the judgments you make. 
Even if it affects those that love you. 
Kim. 
Barry, please, let me speak to my dad. 
I'll be right outside. 
Don't judge him. 
He was there when no one else was. 
The most painful thing that I've ever been through was having to walk away from you. 
Even more painful than losing your mother. 
But it was the only way to make sure that you would be safe. 
I buried you. 
I... I know. 
( sighs ) You know, there's something wrong with people like you. 
You can't hold on to anything. 
Chase couldn't either. 
He tried for a while, and then he was gone, just like you. 
And now, you're back... 
and I'm just supposed to... 
I'm happy that you're alive. 
I am. 
But I can't give you what you want right now. 
Okay. 
I understand that. 
I need you to know that I'm sorry, and I... 
Please, just go. 
Excuse me. 
Burke needs you in Holding. 
I'll be there in a minute. 
I've got to go. 
Barry's got a conference. 
We have a plane to catch. 
Please, Kimberly... 
I want you to stay just a little longer. 
There are some things that I still need to tell you. 
Please? 
I'll talk to Barry. 
Fine. 
I'll be right back. 
* * ( fan whirring ) BUCHANAN: You call for me, Tony? 
Yeah. 
What's going on? 
That's what I wanted to ask you. 
What do you mean? 
What do you think I mean, Bill? 
My wife was killed this morning, right in front of my eyes. 
And nobody here has told me who did it, or why. 
The investigation is ongoing, Tony. 
Come on, Bill. 
I used to work here. 
I know that's what you say to people when you don't want to tell them the truth. 
The truth is you're not an agent anymore. 
And what you're asking me is classified. 
Tony, it doesn't matter what I tell you, there's nothing you can do. 
I know there's nothing I can do! 
Look at me, for God's sake! 
I just want to know who did it. 
I think for the sake of all the years I've given this place, and all the sacrifices I've made I think, I deserve to know. 
Don't you? 
All I can tell you is... 
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan... 
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas. 
Who's behind it? 
Who's responsible, Bill? 
The highest we've been able to get up the chain of command is someone you might know from when you worked here. 
Christopher Henderson. 
What? 
Why? 
We're working on it, Tony. 
Don't let him get away with this, Bill. 
Don't you let him cut a deal. 
I won't. 
What do we know about the man who's with Kim? 
He's registered with the state as a clinical psychologist. 
She was his patient? 
I think so, yes. 
He's ready. 
Whatever he's not telling us is important. 
He knows what's coming. 
And he's willing tolerate an inhuman amount of pain. 
Open the door. 
( door opens ) Damn it, Christopher. 
I don't think you became a part of this because of self-interest. 
I honestly believe that you think what you're doing right now is the best thing for this country, but it is not your choice to make. 
That's good, Jack. 
Disarm your subject's resolve by showing empathy, and respect for his agenda. 
This is not a joke. 
Thousands of lives are at stake. 
people that we promised to protect, to make feel safe. 
There is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity. 
Please. 
I'm sorry, Jack. I really am. 
But I can't tell you what you want to know. 
Start it. 
Mrs. Logan. 
Mrs. Logan, 
if I could have a minute. 
If this is about Aaron, it doesn't concern you. 
No, Mrs. Logan, it doesn't. 
And I'm not here to discuss it. 
What is it? 
The country's facing a crisis. 
The President needs you. 
( chuckles ) He, he needs me. 
If you think the decision to let the attack on the motorcade proceed was easy for him, you're wrong. 
I was with him when he got down on his knees and prayed. 
He did? 
He loves you. 
He didn't want to lose you. 
But with the lives of so many people in jeopardy, he felt he had no choice. 
We've known each other a long time, you and I. 
Why don't you stop talking about what a positive influence I am, and tell me precisely what it is you're trying to get me to do. 
Vice President Gardner is advising your husband to declare martial law in Los Angeles in preparation for the release of the nerve gas. 
He wants to do it without congressional sanction or a timetable to lift it. 
He can't just rewrite the law. 
Hal's got an agenda. 
Well, he's wrong. 
This will make things far worse. 
Mrs. Logan, 
all I know is, the President is listening to Hal Gardner. 
And it will only help the country to have him listening to you as well. 
EDGAR: No, hold off on deploying units seven through 12 until we finalize our target scenario. 
What is it? 
I was running a channel clearance, and I noticed that one of the environmental systems put out a trouble flag. 
It's probably a tech crew changing out a circuit board. 
That's what I thought, but I logged on to the manifest. 
There's nothing scheduled. 
Carrie, I'm in the middle of coordinating with first reonders. 
We're on high alert; I don't have time for this. 
You don't have to snap at me. 
I just thought someone should check it out. 
Then check it out. 
Carrie. 
( drilling ) Can you forgive me? 
You acted like the President of the United States. 
Yes, I did. 
But you wanted me to be your husband first. 
Can't pretend that I didn't. 
But... 
I still love you as much as I always did. 
Martha. 
Shh. 
There'll be plenty of time for us later. 
You have to get back to work. 
The country needs you more than I do. 
Hello? 
Anybody working on the system? 
Chloe. 
Hi, Kim. 
You're still here. 
Yeah. 
Look, my father said that he had to do something. 
You know how long he's gonna be? 
No, sorry. 
Chloe... 
I'm kind of busy right now. 
You knew my father was alive, didn't you? 
For a year and a half you've known. 
Yeah. 
He trusted you. 
Only because he had to; I helped stage his death. 
You don't have to make excuses. 
I'm not making excuses. 
Four people knew he was alive, two of them are dead: President Palmer, and Michelle Dessler; and Tony Almeida's in serious condition. 
Michelle's dead? 
The only reason I'm alive is because your dad found me in time. 
I know this is really hard for you, and it's none of my business, but you should try to cut him some slack. 
( door opens ) What's going on, Bill? 
Lynn... 
What is it? 
We just got a call from LAPD. 
They found your sister's body in her apartment. 
She'd been shot. 
What? 
I just talked to her. 
I saw her today. 
That's impossible. She can't... 
I'm sorry. 
The police ID'd her body. 
My God. 
If you need a phone to make some personal calls or talk to the police... 
Her boyfriend did this to her. 
Tell me he's in custody. 
Is his name Dwayne Thompkins? 
Yeah. 
He didn't do it. 
They found his body, too. 
Lynn, the police are trying to make sense of something. 
Do you know if either your sister or her boyfriend were involved in dealing drugs, or had ties to.... 
organized crime? 
Uh... 
She was a... 
pretty serious user. 
But organized crime no way. Why? 
The killings were clearly the work of a professional. 
Oh, my God. 
I need to see preliminary forensics. 
Who's investigating? 
I have to talk to them. 
I can arrange a meeting... 
No, I have to talk to them now. 
They have to search the apartment. 
See if my keycard is there. 
What are you talking about? 
What keycard? 
My CTU keycard! 
She has it, Bill! 
What was she doing with your keycard? 
It was stolen from me, all right? 
Her boyfriend took it. 
Why didn't you report this? 
I'm reporting it now! 
We don't have time to argue about this. 
Call and see if anybody used it to breach security. 
It was taken about... 
about four hours ago. 
( phone rings ) O'Brian. 
Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn. 
I need you to check the gate logs, now. 
What am I looking for? 
Check and see if anyone used Lynn's keycard to enter CTU in the last four hours. 
Isn't Lynn standing right next to you? 
Chloe, do it! 
Oh, my God. 
It's showing that his card was used less than an hour ago at the executive entrance. 
He was already here... 
Lockdown CTU now! 
This is Chloe O'Brian. 
Initiate a lockdown now. 
Mr. Bauer, I'm sorry. 
I don't know what's going on. 
He should be talking by now. 
Damn it, Christopher. 
It's enough. 
I don't want to do this. 
Just talk to me! 
( faintly ): I can't... 
His vitals are crashing. 
I need to stabilize him in the Clinic before administering another dose. 
( alarm blaring ) ( cell phone rings ) This is Bauer. 
We've been compromised. 
Someone used a stolen keycard to access CTU less than an hour ago. 
Did you get an ID? 
Not yet. 
They didn't use the card to exit. 
They're still here. 
We're in lockdown, starting a search. 
I'm on my way. 
Get him over to medical. 
Stabilize him. 
Don't let anyone near him. 
Did you get him? 
Still working on it. 
Exits are sealed. 
Security cleared Third East, they're going room to room. 
Give me a comm unit. 
Audrey, is Kim still up in Field Ops? 
With Landes, yes. 
Get her down here. 
I want a guard on her. 
I'm on it. 
EDGAR: I think I got him in Third West. 
He's in processing. 
Could exit south or north. 
Jack, take north. 
We'll give you updates. 
Mac's team will head south. 
Copy that. 
Pull up north and south angles. 
There he is. 
Edgar, run his face through recognition software. 
Where's Carrie? 
We need to check for grid intrusions. 
She's checking on a warning signal in a B-socket. 
Got it. 
Checking the grid. 
( groans ) You're gonna help me get out of here. 
He's in the north corridor. 
Chloe, cover for me. 
I want to see what's keeping Carrie. 
Go ahead. 
BUCHANAN: All units, he's moving west in the north corridor. 
He's got one of our men. 
Enter your passcode. 
But it's a lockdown! 
Just do it. 
( beeping ) ( alarm blares ) He's in the north stairwell, sub-level B. 
Jack, do you read? 
I'm on my way. 
Bill, he's in the stairwell. 
I don't think so, Jack. 
Davis said he checked sub-level B. 
Bill... 
It was all clear. 
No, he's doubled back. 
He's using the stairs to get the roof. 
All right, Jack. 
I'm sending you into the landings. 
Let me know when you're ready to move. 
Copy that. 
( alarm continues ) Freeze! 
Let me see your hands! 
Slowly. 
Drop the gun! 
Now! 
Bill, it's Jack. 
Hostile's down. 
He's dead. 
It was the only shot I had. 
Do you have an ID, Jack? 
We've got a bigger problem than that. 
He's got a device on him. 
Looks like a relay switch. 
Hold on. 
He's got a PDA. 
Oh, my God. 
What is it, Jack? 
It's a schematic of CTU's ventilation system. 
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas throughout the building. 
Order an evacuation. 
Code six! 
Everybody out! 
Go! Go! 
Jack, I have Kim with me. 
Stay with her. 
I'm on my way. 
Make sure Burke gets Henderson out of here as fast as he can. 
All right, I'm on it. 
Don't move. 
I'll be right back. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, what's going on? 
Edgar, get out of the building now! 
Carrie? 
( alarm continues ) We have to get out of the building now. 
What's going on? 
Just hurry! 
What's wrong with those people? 
Oh, my God. 
The nerve gas is making its way in. Go. 
The ducts run from the outside in. 
"Outside in"?! 
What does that mean?! 
They start at the perimeter and reach the building core last. 
Auto-lock the outer doors. 
Which rooms can we seal? 
I'm working on it. 
Burke, I need you to stand by. 
We can't leave the building yet. 
I'll let you know where you can move Henderson. 
Chloe, what rooms can we lock down? 
Hold on! 
We can lock down the Situation Room, the upper offices and Clinic Isolation. 
Go, people! 
Kim, everybody, in the Situation Room! Move now. 
BUCHANAN: I'll access Comm from my office! 
Burke, you can move Henderson to the Clinic Isolation. 
Seal it off for bio. 
I repeat: Seal it off for bio. 
Get in the Situation Room now. 
Move! 
Chloe, seal it. 
Seal all the rooms. 
Open the door! 
You have to let me in! 
Open the door! 
Oh, my God. 
Let her in! 
We can't break the seal. 
You have to try and find another exit out of the building. 
Hurry! Go! 
Chloe, are the rest of the rooms sealed? 
Yes, it's done. 
( gagging and choking ) Everybody, stay calm. 
There's nothing we can do for her now. 
Oh, no. 
Oh, my God. 
Chloe.
