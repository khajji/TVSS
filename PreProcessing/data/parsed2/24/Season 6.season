Mr. President, my analysts believe 
that Assad's organisation cannot survive without him and once he's dead, these attacks will stop. 
CTU needs to eliminate Assad. 
That's all there is to it. 
God knows we're paying a steep enough price to get him. 
We were contacted four days ago by a man named Fayed. 
He offered to give us Assad's location for a list of demands. 
And one of them is Jack Bauer. 
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself so we can eliminate Assad. 
The reason why I fought so hard to stay alive in China was because I didn't want to die for nothing. 
Today... 
I can die for something. 
You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine. 
I have a transponder at Assad's location. 
33-58, 11 north latitude. 
100-18-21-40 west longitude. 
Have General Bowen mobilize the attack helicopters. 
I let know the President know we're a go. 
CTU is about to kill the wrong man. 
Assad... 
isn't behind these attacks. 
He's come here to stop them. 
He's come here, to stop me. 
Get out of my house! 
This kid's father is a terrorist. 
Oh, come one. He's no more 
a terrorist than you and me. 
Tell me what happened. 
The FBI, they took my father. 
Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package? 
Yes, it's well hidden. 
You need to deliver it soon. 
Get in there! Find him! 
That way. 
We have to go. 
Not until we've found Bauer. 
We're not here to kill one American, we're here to kill thousands. 
But he knows the truth. 
It doesn't matter. 
By the time Bauer tells anyone, it will be too late. 
Assad will be dead and we'll be free to finish what we started. 
Fayed, listen to me. 
If we don't leave now, we'll jeopardize the mission. 
Alright. 
The target? 
This is where Fayed says Assad is right now. 
 Do you have any heat signature? 
 No, they shield it. 
We can't tell how many are in there. 
Neither if there's anyone in there at all. 
If Fayed lied to us, then Jack bought the farm for nothing. 
Shut up, Milo. 
What's her problem? 
Jack Bauer is a friend of hers. 
It hurt her that he died that way. 
You might want attenuate your foolish remarks. 
Let's go, Milo. 
Two Cobra attack helicopters have been launched from Camp Pendleton to hit Assad's location in fifteen minutes. 
Excuse me, sir. 
 What is it? 
 Jack Bauer is calling in. Line 2. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
Thank God, you're alive. 
What happened? How did you 
Listen to me carefully, we do not have a lot of time. 
I need you to call off the airstrike against Assad. 
 Why? 
 You're going after the wrong man. 
Assad is not responsible for the bombings. 
Where did you get this information? 
It's complicated. I'll explain 
as soon as you call off the airstrike. 
I don't have the power to resend a presidential order, you know that! 
Then put me through the President. 
I'll tell him myself. 
Bill, trust me! 
Just put me through to the White House. 
Alright, stay on the line. 
I have Bill Buchanan for the President. 
Priority 3. 
 Put him through, please. 
 Yes, sir. 
Mr. President, 
there's some new information you need to consider regarding the airstrike on Assad. 
I'm on the line with Jack Bauer. 
He escaped from Fayed. 
What? 
 How? 
 I'm not sure. 
But he's requesting that we abort the airstike against Assad. 
For what possible reason, Bill? 
According to him, Assad is not behind the attacks, sir. 
Bill, that's insane. 
What is Jack basing this on? 
He has an explanation but he wants to talk directly with the President. 
 Put him on. 
 You're online with the President. 
 Mr. President? 
 Jack, I am so sorry Sorry, we don't have a lot of time. 
Did Bill Buchanan explain to you about Assad? 
Yes, he has. But I have to tell you 
we're all sceptical here. 
What's Assad doing in this country if he's not behind these attacks? 
He's trying to stop them. 
He's trying to stop Fayed. 
So, you're saying that Fayed is carrying out these bombings? 
Yes, sir. 
Fayed admitted to me that Assad is planning to renounce terrorism. 
He's trying to mainstream his organization. 
He wants to bring them into the political process. 
Fayed wants to stop that from happening. 
Fayed is behind this recent wave of attacks. 
Jack, this is inconsistent with twenty years of terrorism on Assad's part. 
His organisation has waged non stop war against the West. 
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths. 
I am aware of Assad's history. 
And I am still telling you thats there is sufficient cause to call off this strike. 
What if we change the airstrike to a ground assault? 
 I mean, if we capture Assad  Sir, we cannot afford a ground assault. 
We have to take him out now, while we've got the chance. 
Mr. President, if Jack is right, 
we've got the wrong man. 
It's a risk we have to take. 
Jack has been in a Chinese prison for twenty months. 
His habillity to assess this situation is highly questionable. 
I believe he's being played. 
I know what I heard, Karen. 
I am not being played. 
Now, all deference to Mr. Bauer, 
I think Karen is right. 
Mr. President, you want to stop 
these attacks, you need to stop Fayed. 
And in order to do that, you need to capture Assad and find out what he knows. 
Sir, he might be the only hope you have. 
Mr. President, 
I know your history with Mr. Bauer runs deep. 
But don't let that impact your judgement here. 
We have the opportunity to eliminate Assad, we have to take it. 
Bill, I want a real time progress on that airstrike. 
I'm sending you a video uplink down, sir. 
Mr. President, don't do this. 
Jack, I am sorry. 
I am. 
Jack, give me your location, I'll send a unit to pick you up. 
Bill, killing Assad is a mistake. 
Right now, he's your only chance of finding Fayed. 
It's the President's call, Jack. 
But we'll do all we can when you get back to CTU. 
That will be too late. 
Jack, tell me where you are. 
KEY IN ADDRESS (del vo) RECEIVING LOCATION... (del vo) 
Don't put me on hold again! 
I've been on hold for ten minutes! 
Just give me the agent in charge. 
I will wait on the line. 
Damm it. 
She says they will call me back on this number. 
But they didn't tell you where they're holding my father? 
No, they cannot release that information. 
Do you have the package? 
I'm still at my friend's house across the street. 
They helping me find out where the FBI took my father. 
You're not free to talk? 
Just tell me if you have the package. 
Not yet, but I'll have it soon. 
There are other people I could have chosen for this task. 
But I chose you. 
Now, get out of there. 
Retrieve the package. 
Call me when you have it. 
Yes. 
I have to go back to my house. 
I'm meeting my uncle. 
Do you think that's wise? 
Are you sure? 
 Man, you should stay here. 
 No, I'll be fine. 
Don't worry. Thank you, for everything. 
 Thank you. 
 Take care. 
Don't worry, sweetheart, his family is taking care of him now. 
Ahmed. 
Hold on. 
Listen, I am sorry. 
I can't believe this is happening. 
It's like the all world has gone crazy. 
It's been crazy for a long time, we just haven't been paying attention. 
Yeah, we are now. 
You know what? 
You should take this. 
I got this at a fair in Oregon. 
It's supposed to mean good luck. 
Thank, but I-- I can't take it. 
Why? 
You might need it yourself someday. 
Cobra to Zebra 1, lead is cleared out. 
Zebra 1 is cleared out. 
Flight is cleared for immediate engagement at lead's discretion. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
please hold for Karen Hayes. 
 Bill? 
 Yes, Karen. 
You're also online with the President. 
We're monitoring the video feed of the cobras. 
How soon before they hit Assad's location? 
 Five minutes. 
 And how soon after the strike can we expect confirmation that Assad is dead? 
Curtis will lead a team into the target zone. 
They'll do a point by point grid search as soon as the strike is completed. 
Thank you. 
We get ready. 
... request heading change, 1-5-0. 
Zebra 1 is heading southwest through downtown corridor. 
Approximately three minutes, fifty seconds till lock on target. 
Zebra 1 changing 4-2-1-8-3 to a southerly approach of the target. 
Roger that, Zebra 1. 
1-8-3. 
Lock in two minutes, thirty seconds. 
Drop the coffee. 
Don't move! 
Don't even think about it. 
Where is Assad? 
Where is Assad! 
Put down your weapon! 
I said, put down your weapon. 
 My name is Jack Bauer. 
 I know who you are. 
This house has been targeted for military strike. 
I need to get you and your men out of here now. 
Check the street. 
I came here alone. 
I know about Fayed. 
I know he's behind the bombings. 
I know you're here to stop him. 
No one outside. 
Fayed has set you up. 
He provided CTU with the coordinates to this house. 
Kill him, Assad! 
In a few minutes, it's not gonna matter. 
We'll all be dead. 
Don't listen to him, it's a trap. 
There's a transponder that's been planted inside this house. 
U.S. military's using it 
to pinpoint the strike. 
There is no transponder here. 
We've searched the entire house. 
One of your men must have it on. 
It's the only possible explanation. 
One of your men is working for Fayed. 
Have them empty their pockets. 
Assad, don't listen to him, he's lying. 
Damn it, I'm telling you the truth. 
Why else would I be here? 
If I wanted to kill you, I would have come in shooting! 
Have your men empty their pockets! 
I'm trying to save your life. 
Wait! 
Empty your pockets. 
 But Assad  I said, empty your pockets. 
Behind you! 
Search him! 
You betrayed us! 
No. 
You are the one who betrayed these people. 
Assad, we need to leave now. 
If you are telling the truth, you will not need that gun. 
Go, Assad! You need to leave. 
We'll secure the files. 
Hurry up! 
Move! Move! 
 Are you alright? 
 He's been hit. 
Get him up. 
Move. 
Mister President? 
The target has been destroyed. 
We are an advocacy group. 
These people are all volunteers. 
They're very good people. 
I'm sure they are, sir. 
All we're doing is assembling a working database of names to cross check against our watch list. 
Excuse me, Sondra, the FBI is here. 
The FBI? 
They're asking for access to our personnel records. 
We take pride in being good citizens and we will cooperate with you in order to stop these attacks. 
May I see your warrant, gentlemen? 
I'm M. Arvazani's attorney. 
I also represent this organization. 
We know who you are, ma'am. 
And I'm afraid we don't have a warrant. 
Then I'm afraid we can't turn over our personnel records. 
That information is private, and their privacy's protected by law. 
I understand, ma'am. But in light 
of what's happening around the country, we don't think it's unreasonable to ask for the cooperation of our citizens. 
You're looking in the wrong place. 
There're no terrorists here. 
So unless you have a warrant, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. 
Please, don't make me ask twice. 
Alright, ma'am. 
This is getting out of hand. 
Maybe we should give them what they want. 
 You can't be serious. 
 We have nothing to hide. 
No, but we have something to protect. 
The privacy of everyone who's ever worked for this organization. 
Maybe we have to sacrifice a little privacy. 
The country is under attack, Sondra. 
We cannot pretend it isn't. 
Who are you calling? 
Yes, it's Sondra Palmer. 
I'd like to speak with my brother. 
We're still sweeping the target zone. 
We've recovered four bodies. 
Forensics are running field ID now. 
They're sending data back to CTU. 
Well, let's hope one of them is Assad. 
The President's sister is on the line, sir. 
Well, I think he'll wanna call her back. 
 She says it's urgent. 
 I'll take it. 
 Mr. President, we're... 
 Tom, it's okay. 
Let me have the room, please. 
What's going on, Sondra? 
I'm sorry to burden you with this, but I think you need to know. 
The FBI was just here and they wanted access to the IAA's personnel records. 
Did they say why? 
They gave some excuse about expanding their database. 
Listen, Sondra. 
You know I have to do whatever I can to stop these attacks, right? 
 Yes. 
 Well, that includes giving law enforcement the authority to follow up on every single lead they get. 
That's my point. 
They weren't following any lead. 
They were invading a group of people's privacy based on their religion. 
Look, Wayne, you know I'm not some idealistic flag burner, and I understand that you're going through a very complicated situation, but... 
once your start ethnic profiling, it's a slippery slope. 
I'll look into it. 
You should probably start with Tom Linnick. 
This has his name written all over. 
Sondra, please, don't start it on Tom again. 
He treats the constitution like a list of suggestions. 
He's laying the framework for a major crackdown, and civil protections be damned. 
Listen, let's be honest. 
You don't like Tom, and you never have! 
Neither did David. 
Excuse me, sir. 
Bill Buchanan's on the line for you. 
One moment. 
Sondra, I gotta go. 
Wayne, look. 
I'm sorry to put this on you, okay? 
I just... 
... wouldn't have called 
if I didn't think it was important. 
I understand. 
 You take care of yourself, okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. I love you too. 
I hope I got through to him. 
You made a good case, and he's a good man. He'll listen. 
Thanks. 
For what? 
For making that call, and for not letting me lose sight of what we're fighting for. 
Go ahead, Bill. 
We completed our sweep of the strike zone, sir. 
Recovered four bodies. 
None of them is Assad. 
 What? 
 Are you sure? 
We're still checking the site, but I think it's safe to assume Assad is alive. 
How the hell did we miss him! 
We couldn't have, sir. 
Someone must have warned him. 
Or the intel we got from Fayed was bad and Assad was never there to begin with. 
That's irrelevant. What matters now 
is that Assad is still out there. 
We're sealing a 10 block perimeter around the area, sir. 
Assad may still be in the vicinity. 
Alright, Bill. 
We put everything we had into that strike. 
We thought if we could cut off the head, we could stop these attacks, and now... 
Damn. 
What do you think Assad's next move is gonna be? 
Likely? There will be more attacks, 
but respond, he will, guaranteed. 
Talked to Ahmed. 
We'll have the package soon. 
Good. 
 Is he ready? 
 Yes. He's waiting for you. 
It's not necessary. 
I will not fail you. 
I don�t question your devotion, Nasser. 
When the moment approaches, even the most devout can experience fear. 
Look at me. 
By overcoming your fear, you prove your worth. 
I've been proud to have known you in this life, Nasser. 
Your family will learn about your sacrifice. 
Alright. No more loads. 
Let's get outta here. 
Let's go. 
Put him here. 
He's unconscious. 
CTU's gonna realize you weren't killed in the air strike. 
They're gonna widen their search grid. 
 We can't stay here much longer. 
 He knows where Fayed is. 
I'll only need a few minutes. 
Fayed told me that you wanted to disarm your organization. 
You're gonna start negociations with the West. Is that true? 
I've gotten most of my people and the governments that support us to agree to a cease fire with the West. 
 And that's Fayed wants to sabotage? 
 Yes. 
Once Fayed is eliminated, everyone else will fall into line and I can go public with my proposal. 
But finding Fayed is the key to everything. 
I'll be right back. 
Mr. Buchanan, I know why Assad 
wasn't in the building when the missile hit. 
I need to show you something. 
This is an aerial frame enhancement of the building a couple of seconds before it was destroyed. 
Jack rescued Assad. 
This makes sense, from Jack's perspective, if Assad is trying to stop the bombing. 
The President Palmer and you wife... 
I mean Karen Hayes think he's wrong. 
So what am I supposed to do with this? 
Who else has seen it? 
 Nobody but me. 
 Okay. Let's keep it that way for now. 
Jack didn't save Assad out of compassion. 
He's gonna use him to find Fayed. 
But if he's right, then we should be looking for Fayed too. 
Right. 
Refilter the channel trace, see if we can sort something out on Fayed. 
 Okay. 
 Good work. 
We have a car! 
If we gonna find Fayed in time, we have to involve CTU. 
You mean the people who tried to kill me, who killed 4 of my men! 
They have resources you don't. 
They will lock me in a room and question me for days! 
Fayed worked under me for years. 
I know how thinks and I will find him, but I will do it on my terms. 
 Where is Fayed? 
 I do not know. 
Where is he? 
I was just ordered to plant the transponder. 
 Where is Fayed? 
 I don't know! 
Please, stop... 
Please... 
Why did you stop? 
I can see in his eyes... 
He's not gonna tell us anything. 
Where is Fayed? 
I know where some of his men will be. 
I overheard Fayed giving them instructions to go there. 
Where? 
Figueroa and Sixth. 
When? 
After you were killed. 
 You've told me everything? 
 Yes. 
I swear it. 
I swear it. 
I believe you. 
I understand... 
... how you felt you were doing 
the right thing. 
I admire your conviction. 
But you have taken the wrong path, Shahid. 
I'm sorry. 
Let's go. 
My men are dead. 
I can find Fayed. 
But I cannot stop him by myself. 
I don't know how to do this anymore. 
You'll remember. 
You'd better come out here. 
The FBI is back. They have a warrant. 
Who is the applicant for this warrant? 
I want to see the affidavit. 
The papers weren't filed with a district court. 
We've a legally executive warrant. 
Either you hand over the files, or we take them. 
It's your choice. 
This is an administrative warrant. 
It's not valid in this situation. 
That's your opinion. 
They're in the media room. 
I'll show you. 
I need to use your computer. 
Malek. I need copies 
of all of our personel files. 
 Okay? 
 No problem. 
What is it? 
I can't find the files. 
Reset and try again. 
 They're not here. 
 What do you mean? 
They're not where they are supposed to be. 
Because they've been erased. 
And don't bother trying to recall them, I used the shredding program. 
Sondra, what are you doing? 
Check it. 
She's telling the truth. 
You're under arrest. 
Obstructing official business, destroying evidence. 
Take Mr. Arizani into custody. 
Wait a minute, he has nothing to do with this. 
That's the judge's call. 
But, I am telling you, he's not involved! 
Are you sure about this? 
I told you before, she gets no special treatment. 
I know, but she's the President's sister. 
We have orders handed down and we're gonna follow them. 
Inpound every workstation and hard drive in this office. 
Thought I forgot about you, huh? 
This is for everyone... 
you bastards killed today. 
How do you like to die? 
Get up! Get up! 
Are you deaf. Didn't you hear me? 
You're dead. 
Please... don't... 
Please... 
Ahmed? 
What happened? 
What happened? 
I'm gonna call an ambulance. 
We're not calling anybody. 
 Ahmed  I can't go to the hospital. 
You're hurt. 
I'm gonna call 911. 
You shouldn't have come here, Scott. 
Look, I don't wanna to hurt you. 
But I will, unless you do exactly what I say. 
We're friends. 
What friends? 
You can't even pronounce my name! 
It's not "Amed"... 
It's A"h"med. 
This is the location Amar gave us. 
Over there. 
Two men in suits. 
One carrying a briefcase. 
He's a Fayed's man. 
The man in front is wearing an explosive vest. 
They're setting up another strike. 
Go! 
They're going in the subway. 
The detonator is in his right hand. 
We can't let him get on the train. 
Only the bomber in getting on the train. 
The other man is the handler. 
He'll see the bomber off, then, he'll leave. 
The handler will lead us to Fayed. 
You follow the handler, I'm going after the bomber. 
 Go ahead. 
 He's on the train. 
He'll reach Union station in... 
5 minutes. 
The moment it pausing, he'll martyr himself. 
The car is at the arranged place, take it. 
Go to Union station to confirm. 
Call me when it's done. 
Understood. 
Thank you. 
Ticket. 
Ticket, please. 
Sir. 
Have a ticket? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I am a federal agent. 
You have a terrorist on this train with a bomb. 
I need you to walk away. 
If he notices anything unusual, he will detonate his bomb. 
Now, move away! 
He has a bomb! 
And the wave of violence aimed an American target... 
... the Baltimore's largest 
shopping mall... 
Fayed, something went wrong. 
I'm here at Union station, but there's no explosion. 
And there is a cloud a smoke four blocks west from here. 
Whatever the case, it doesn't matter. 
Our other attacks were successfull. 
Once again, the streets are flowing with blood. 
We're dealing with 3 simultaneous bombings. 
1 in a Baltimore shopping mall, another one in a Chicago hotel. 
In both cases, casualties are expected to be high. 
 What about the third one? 
 I call you back. 
It was here, the metro red line. 
Appears to be a suicide bomber. 
Hang on. There may be some good news. 
Aside from the bomber, no one else was killed. 
How could that happened? 
A metro rail employee claims a passenger jumped to the bomber before he could set off his vest. 
The passenger identified himself as Jack Bauer. 
Get on the metro sub-net. 
Check who was on that train and who got caught by security camera. 
I want a visual confirmation before I speak to the President. 
Yes, sir. 
Sir? You need to hear this. 
It's a cell phone call. Write tagged 
from the NSA surveillance software. 
Fayed, something went wrong. 
I'm here at Union Station, but... 
I think we need to contact the White House. 
... bomb outside the hotel 
was detonated by remote control. 
sending bodies falling out of windows from as high as the 21th floor. 
Mr. President, if it's any consolation, 
these attacks were planned far in advance of the raid on Assad. 
Tom, all that means is there will be more attacks. 
We're in a full blown war here, and we still have no way to fight back. 
Excuse me. M. President... 
CTU just called. 
They intercepted a cell phone call between Fayed and one of the men behind today's bombings. 
Fayed? 
Are they sure? 
Yes, sir. 
Fayed is the one behind these attacks. 
Not Assad. 
Sir... 
... I promoted the strike against Assad. 
But I approved it, Karen. 
We were all in agreement. 
So, Jack was right. 
He was right all along and I... 
This is gonna get much worse. 
 Yeah? 
 What happened? 
I'll explain later. 
Are you still following the handler? 
Yes. I'm in the car. 
We're in Alameida, 2 blocks from Union Station. 
We're heading in your direction. 
Copy that, I'll find you. 
Just stay with handler. 
He's our only connection to Fayed! 
=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody... 
and he let him go. 
Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland. 
Someone is going to have to go down the farther from the president, the better. 
Are you asking me to resign? 
HAYES: No, Bill. 
I have to fire you. 
We're talking about the end of my career. 
An FB sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government. 
If the Chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire Russian defense system will be compromised. 
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter. 
You are talking about attacking one of our military bases. 
You have two hours. 
Everyone on the floor! 
CHENG: My men have your grandson. 
Have you finished repairing the sub-circuit board? 
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson. 
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now. 
Hello, Josh. 
Your grandfather wants to speak with you. 
What do you want from me? 
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born. 
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country. 
Cheng, it's over! 
Tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you. 
Help! 
Josh! 
Dad... 
(grunting) I lost the boy. 
PHILLIP: Who has him? 
CTU and your son. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
The boy was my price for repairing the circuit board. 
Our arrangement is over. 
Got Phillip Bauer calling for you on a scrambled line. 
I want my grandson. 
And I want clear passage to the country of my choice. 
You give me that and I'll give you the FB sub-circuit board. 
You're working with the Chinese. 
I was. 
You think Phillip Bauer is somebody that we can trust? 
We have no choice. 
Get me CTU. 
Josh, you need to come with me. 
What do you mean?! 
Come now! 
Agent Doyle! 
Orders, Jack! 
The boy stays with me! 
What are you doing?! 
Josh! 
Where are you taking me? 
I thought we were going back to CTU. 
I'm sorry, Josh. 
You're sorry for what? 
What's going on? 
This has to do with my grandpa. 
Josh, he's got something we need. 
Something that will stop a war. 
So we have to go through the motions of handing you over to him. 
What, meaning you're not actually going to do it? 
Meaning as soon as we get what we need from him, we're gonna recover you. 
We have two Tac teams and LAPD at the rendezvous site. 
This is a locating device, Josh. 
So we're going to be able to track you until we get the green light on your recovery operation. 
Look, I understand you're scared. 
I would be, too. 
But I will get you back, Josh. 
This may sting a little. 
Ow! 
Ryan, we are making a mistake. 
You can't let them do this. 
You can talk to Doyle. 
You can't let them hand Josh over to my father. 
Those orders come from the White House. 
Get in the car. 
Are you arresting me? 
Are you charging me with something? 
No, Jack, we have orders to place you in temporary custody in order to protect our operation. 
Don't make this harder than it is. 
(indistinct radio transmission) (sighs) (phone rings) O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Jack, Nadia said you were in custody. 
Why the hell is CTU handing Josh over to my father? 
It's a tradeoff. 
The order came in from the Vice President. 
Your father got ahold of the FB sub-circuit board. 
He's offering it in exchange for Josh and a safe passage out of the country. 
Whatever my father said, he has no intention of giving up that circuit board. 
The White House feels they have no alternative. 
Apparently, Doyle has a plan to get Josh back. 
My father will have a better plan. 
Damn it, Chloe, we need to stop this. 
Put me through to Karen Hayes. 
Hold on. 
My earlier deception was a desperate move on my part, Mr. President. 
It was a mistake which I'm sure compromised your trust in me, and for that I'm deeply sorry. 
But you are not calling simply to offer your apology. 
Sir, I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response, but an opportunity has presented itself that may allow us both to avoid a war that neither of us wants. 
I am listening. 
The man who has the component is no longer working with the Chinese. 
He's offered to trade it back to us, and I've authorized the exchange. 
For the sake of both our countries, Mr. Vice President, 
I hope it happens soon, because until you have the component, I have no choice but to continue on our present path. 
(phone rings) The chatter we are picking up from Chinese military intelligence is not encouraging, and you and I both know they are far from incompetent. 
I cannot extend or rescind this deadline for anything other than concrete results. 
I understand your position, Mr. President. 
The purpose of this call is just to keep you current on our efforts to try to avoid a conflict. 
Karen Hayes. 
JACK: This is Bauer. 
Do you know of the Vice President's plan to hand my nephew over to my father? 
I do. 
Karen, you cannot let this happen. 
It is a mistake to trust my father. 
You will get nothing back. 
He's gonna keep Josh and the circuit board. 
But why would he need the circuit board? 
Because it's his only leverage with the Chinese. 
He's useless to them without it. 
Whatever you're offering him, the Chinese are offering more. 
Karen, my father is smart enough to manipulate this exchange. 
Look, Jack, I don't think we should go through with this either, but the Vice President feels it's the only way to avoid war. 
He's given his order and I don't have the authority to do anything. 
You're gonna have to take care of this from your end. 
I can't. CTU has put me 
in temporary custody to stop me from interfering with their operation. 
Karen, he is an innocent boy. 
You need to stop this, and you need to stop it now. 
Well, that did not go well. 
Not that I expected much good will from Suvarov. 
I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer. 
I thought he was under arrest. 
He is, but he called me. 
Okay, he called you... 
Yes, and he's convinced that his father will try to get the boy and the circuit board. 
How's he gonna do that? 
We can verify the authenticity of the board before we hand over Josh. 
You think Jack's concerns are warranted? 
Absolutely. He's Phillip Bauer's 
son and he's been more right than we have today. 
Well, point taken there. 
All right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh, which is the only thing Phillip Bauer seems to want. 
How do we get the circuit board? 
Well, if you don't have any ideas, I think I might. 
Wait. If your idea involves 
keeping Daniels in the dark... 
Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you... 
My relationship with the Vice President is complicated, at best. 
I can't be seen making an end run around him. 
But I promise I won't be looking your way if you do. 
(cell phone rings) (snaps phone shut) Hey. Hey! 
That's personal. 
Nothing you need in there. 
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena 
covers everything. I'm sorry. 
It's a family photo album, for crying out loud. 
You haven't been charged with any crimes yet, but that could change. 
(phone rings) RECORDING: You've reached the Buchanan residence. 
Please leave a message. 
HAYES: Bill, I know you're there. 
Please pick up. 
Look, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I really need your help. 
I don't know where else to turn. 
What do you mean, you don't know where else to turn? 
Are you okay? 
No, I'm fine. 
I just... 
I really need your help. 
I'm listening. 
Thank you. 
I know that you're angry with me, and I don't blame you. 
What do you need from me, Karen? 
I just got off the phone with Jack. 
He's being held in custody by CTU. 
Why? 
Because they don't want him to interfere with an ongoing operation. 
What operation? 
Phillip Bauer is now in possession of the component. 
What? 
And he's claiming that he will trade the sub-circuit board for his grandson, but Jack thinks it's a setup; that Phillip will get the boy, keep the component, and make a deal with the Chinese. 
I completely agree. 
Have you spoken to Nadia Yassir? 
Oh, she won't budge on this thing. 
She's under direct orders from the Vice President. 
What are you asking me to do, Karen? 
Whatever it takes to stop the exchange. 
Nadia, we just touched down at the meeting point and I'm not seeing any activity. 
Satellite surveillance confirms that. 
How's the signal on Josh's tracker? 
Coming in clear. 
Tracker's signal's strong. 
Wait here. 
I'm gonna check it out. 
Come on. 
(cell phone rings) CTU, I've got a call coming in. 
It could be him. 
Morris, can you trace the call? 
The signal's scrambled, but we're still patched into Doyle's phone, so we'll be able to listen to both sides of the conversation. 
All right, Mike. 
Go ahead. Answer it. 
This is Doyle. 
Before we do anything, I want CTU to turn off the satellite feed. 
What are you talking about? 
I have an uplink. 
I know when they're watching. 
And I know when they're off-line. 
Stand by. 
Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing? 
MORRIS: Yeah. 
He's not bluffing. 
He's absolutely in our system. 
How? 
I don't know. 
Mike, we have confirmation that Phillip Bauer has tapped into our satellite surveillance. 
Can he see Josh's tracker signal? 
No. That's on 
an internal network. 
All right. 
Then go off-line. 
Tell LAPD and the Tac teams to keep a really wide perimeter outside the satellite area. 
We can't afford to spook him. 
Morris, shut down the satellite. 
Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know. 
On it. 
It's done. 
Mike, satellite is off-line. 
Mr. Bauer, 
CTU's satellite is off-line. 
I can see that. 
Now get rid of the chopper. 
Aerial One, return to base. 
That's an order. 
Now, how do you want to work the exchange? 
Wait there. Someone will come. 
When? 
Whenever I'm damn well ready. 
Put my grandson on the phone. 
Your grandfather. 
He wants to speak with you. 
But don't fight him, Josh. 
Okay? The easier he thinks 
this is going to go, the less on-guard he's going to be. 
Yeah. 
Hello, Joshua. 
Have you given any thought to what we talked about? 
Yes. And I don't want 
to go anywhere with you. 
I hate you! 
Joshua, listen to me. 
I understand you're frightened and angry. 
But your father's involvement in what happened today will soon be public knowledge. 
Staying in this country is not an option. 
There's nothing here for you. 
My mom's here. 
Your mother can join you anytime she wants. 
But she is incapable of giving you what you need. 
Where we're going, I will have the means and the power to help you become the kind of man  your father  should have been. 
Now, you think about that. 
#No sign of anyone so far. 
Yeah. We're still looking for 
ways to get satellite coverage without Phillip Bauer knowing, but so far, it looks like he's covered all his bases. 
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me. 
How do I verify the component's real, once they hand it over? 
Chloe? 
The component has an R-7-2 socket on its underside. 
When you plug your PDA into that, I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here. 
Good. 
Nadia, once I know the component's real, if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'm gonna take it. 
No, you're not, Mike. 
Look, I want to see Josh safe, too, but we're under strict orders from the White House. 
We're not authorized to retrieve him until the component's back at CTU. 
I'm not talking about what I'm authorized to do. 
Well, I am. Mike, there's 
too much at stake. 
You're not going off-book on this. Understood? 
Mike, do you confirm? 
MARCY: Nadia, I have Karen Hayes on two. 
All right. Put it through 
to my cell phone. 
Mike, I have to take this call. 
You're on com with Chloe and Morris. 
Yeah. I'll keep them posted. 
Yes, Ms. Hayes? 
Nadia, the Vice President would like to check on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer. 
Well, the agent handling the exchange is in position with the boy and he's waiting to be contacted. 
I did tell the White House that I would report in as soon as that happened. 
Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure that everyone's onboard. 
That no one, including yourself, has any doubts that this is the right course of action. 
The order comes from the Vice President. 
It's not being questioned. 
What's the status of Jack Bauer? 
He's currently being transferred to the detention at District. 
Good. I need to be able 
to view the operation on your internal deployment grid. 
Do you mind me asking why? 
Yes, actually, I do. 
The Vice President wants me to keep track of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code now, please. 
Right away. 
Log onto the grid on nine-four. 
Security code Alpha-Charlie-November. 
Got it. Thank you. 
I just got a call from Security. 
You better head over to the lounge. 
Why? What's the problem? 
Marilyn Bauer. 
I'm not a prisoner, so stop treating me like one. 
I want to see my son, and I want to see him now! 
And if you can't tell me where he is, I will find somebody who can! 
Get out of my way! 
Get out of my way! 
Listen, Mrs. Bauer. 
If you just calm down, we can talk. 
Did something happen? 
Did he get hurt? 
No. Josh is fine. 
(sighs) He's just being held at Division. 
They want to debrief him while events are still fresh in his mind. 
You have no right to talk to my son if I'm not there. 
He needs to have a parent present. I want to be 
with my son! 
I understand what you're going through. 
No! You have no idea 
what I'm going through! 
And if you don't get me to him right now, I'm going to get our lawyers, and I will take this whole place down, including you! 
(muttering) (phone rings) O'Brian. 
Morris, I need you to send additional security to the lounge area to escort Mrs. Bauer 
to holding. 
MARILYN: I want my son! 
You can't keep me here! 
They're on their way. 
NADIA: Thanks. 
This is Morris O'Brian. 
Can I have two additional security to the lounge area to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding, please? 
Thank you. 
What? 
It doesn't bother you that we're doing this? 
What if we don't get Josh back? 
Phillip Bauer is a murderer. 
I don't like it I hate it but we have our orders. 
Since when do you care about orders? 
We're trying to avoid starting a war. 
Speaking as someone that placed a lot of people's lives at risk today, I can see why it's necessary. Yes. 
Jack thinks we're being manipulated. 
That his father has no intention of giving us the component back. 
I don't think we can count on Jack being objective about his father right now. 
Who cares if he's being objective, if he's right? 
Are you actually angry at me? 
As if I'm the one that made the decision to go through with this? 
No. I... It's just 
that Josh didn't do anything. 
He's innocent. 
Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker. If that signal 
weakens even a little, I want to know about it immediately. 
I will. 
CTU, this is Doyle. 
You're on with O'Brian. 
I've got a helicopter approaching out of the north. 
It's too far to read its markings. 
You think it might be Phillip Bauer? 
I don't know, Morris. 
That's why I'm asking you. 
All right. 
No need to get testy. 
Pulling up the FAA database now. 
Coast Guard has a helicopter patrol just west of your position. 
It's not Phillip Bauer. 
All right. Thanks. 
Doyle? 
Yeah? 
I know that a lot of people disagree with this operation. 
I just want you to know that what you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary. 
Morris, the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. 
Fair enough. 
What is this lunatic doing? 
(horn honking) (tires screeching) Don't move. 
Get your handcuffs out. 
Do it! 
Mr. Buchanan? 
What the hell are you doing? 
You have Jack Bauer in there? 
TURNER: We have orders to transport him to Detention at District. 
I need you to release him to me. 
Mr. Buchanan, you've been 
relieved of duty. 
You know me, Turner. 
I'm no threat to anyone. 
I'm not even armed. 
Stay where you are, sir. 
You're not going to shoot me, Turner. 
Sir, you need to stop coming at me. You know 
what I'll have to do. 
You don't have to do anything. 
You're a good man, Turner. 
I trained you. 
I know you can't possibly believe what's happening here is right. 
I know you're following orders, but your oath of allegiance is not to one single person. 
You swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
The orders you're following are illegal. 
You have an opportunity here, Turner. 
Don't blow it. 
Agent Turner, put the weapon down. 
Put it down. 
They hand Josh over to my father yet? 
No. Doyle's in position 
with the boy. 
He's awaiting instructions from your father. 
Okay. 
Let's go. 
Karen explain everything to you? 
Yeah. 
Thank you for doing this. 
You don't have to thank me. 
You put yourself on the line. 
I appreciate it. 
Let's just hope you're right about your father. 
Unfortunately, I am. 
#Thank you. 
(whispers): Stuart... 
Morris... 
find out who that is. 
I'm so sorry. 
I don't believe we've met. 
Morris O'Brian. 
This is Stuart-- Milo's brother. 
Oh, I'm so very sorry. 
Very sorry. 
I have to sign a release for his body. 
I'll help you with the paperwork. 
Come on. 
Thanks, Chloe. 
He was a good man. 
It's Milo's brother, Stuart. 
(phone ringing) Hi, Karen. 
Hi. 
I've got Jack. 
We're on our way. 
I just... I wanted 
to thank you. 
You didn't have to do this. 
You made a big sacrifice. 
I'm not the only one. 
Won't be long before they figure out how I was able to locate Jack. 
Yeah, well, they already have. 
I've just been denied access. 
They're probably on their way to arrest me. 
Listen... 
I don't know when they'll let us speak to each other again, so I just want you to know that I'm so sorry. 
And I love you very much. 
Me, too. 
They're here. 
Good luck. 
They're about to arrest Karen. 
Hi. 
Stuart? 
Yeah. 
I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU. 
We're in the middle of an operation right now, so I don't have much time. 
I just wanted to meet you and tell you how sorry I am. 
I know your name. 
My brother talked about you. 
I'd like to know how he died. 
Your brother died saving my life. 
He saw that I was in danger, and he stood up for me and sacrificed himself. 
He was very brave. 
No, he wasn't. 
Not really. 
It's more that he was really in love with you. 
(phone ringing) Excuse me. I'll be right back. 
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead. 
Local police found Agents Ryan and Turner handcuffed to their vehicle. 
Jack escaped? How? 
They were intercepted by Bill Buchanan. 
Are you sure? 
Positive. 
Why would Bill do something like that? 
Probably because he agrees with Jack that we shouldn't be trading Josh or trusting his father, regardless of what the orders are. 
Have Tac teams in the area move into position to intercept them. 
They're already doing that. 
I'm sorry, I had to, uh... 
Mr. Doyle... 
Yeah? 
Listen, please don't do this. 
Okay, my grandpa's crazy. 
Okay, just please, just let me go. 
Josh... your country 
needs you to do this. 
I'll get you back, Josh. 
I give you my word. 
Doyle, this is Nadia. 
Do you copy? 
Go ahead, Nadia. 
Any sign of Phillip Bauer yet? 
None yet. 
Mike, Jack escaped from custody. 
We have to assume he's on his way to you to try and stop the exchange. 
How the hell does Jack even know where we are? 
Karen Hayes told him and gave him your location. 
Bill Buchanan helped him escape. 
Damn it. 
I've got Tac teams ready to move in. 
Look, you know we can't bring more men in. 
Phillip Bauer will spot them on satellite and he'll pull out of this. 
Then you'll have to face him alone. 
I'll be fine. 
Is my uncle coming? 
Yeah. 
#Excuse us, please. 
(door closes) I assume you know why I ordered your detention. 
I do. 
Then you admit to using information you got from CTU to assist Bill Buchanan in breaking Jack Bauer out of custody. 
Yes, I do, sir. 
Karen... 
you and I have had our differences, but I thought that we had worked past them, that you and I had finally reached an understanding. 
Clearly, I was mistaken. 
What in the hell were you thinking? 
I learned a hard lesson today, sir, when I trusted Fayed. 
What lesson was that? 
Never negotiate with a sociopath. 
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath. 
We can't trust that he'll give us that component whether we give him the boy or not. 
Damn it, Karen, that is not your call to make. 
I understand that, sir. 
I wouldn't have done what I did if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences. 
Oh, believe me, there will be consequences. 
I will make sure that you and your husband go down hard for this. 
(sighs) You know, it was Tom Lennox who said your different point of view would be an asset to my team, and I believed him. 
Was he in on this with you? 
No, sir. 
He didn't know anything about this. 
Karen... 
if Jack Bauer prevents this exchange from happening, the Russians will attack our forces in Central Asia. 
Any blood that is spilled will be on you. 
(knocks twice) (door closes) (phone ringing) CTU, I've got an incoming call. 
Yeah. 
Take Josh and walk toward the water. 
We're on our way. 
Nadia, did you get that? 
Yes. Agent Doyle, 
be careful. 
We need to go, Josh. 
Tracker shows them moving towards the water. 
MORRIS: Chloe... 
Chloe. 
You all right? 
You look a little pale. 
I'm fine. Just tired. 
(distant whooshing) You hear that? 
Yeah. 
NADIA: Mike, what do you have? 
Nadia, we got two men in a small watercraft coming ashore. 
We're taking cover. 
(motor humming) You stay here, understand? 
Don't move. 
Stop right there. 
Send the kid down now. 
Show the sub-circuit board first. 
I need to verify it. 
Walk forward. 
Place it down. 
Back up. 
(screams) Mike! 
Mike, report in. 
(grunting) There they are. 
They've got Josh. 
I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk. 
(gunfire) Get down! 
Doyle! 
We're gonna get you help. 
The component was a fake. 
It blew. 
Take it easy, Doyle. 
Help's on the way. 
Stay with him, I'm calling CTU. 
(Doyle groaning) Mr. Bauer. 
PHILLIP: Yeah. 
We got the boy. 
Be sure to scan him. 
I don't trust CTU. 
Yes, sir. 
(whirring) (rapid beeping) They tagged him. 
Short it out. 
(electrical whoosh) (yells) It's done. 
(computer blips) We lost the tracker. 
Try the backup frequency. 
I did, it's gone. 
Morris, get that satellite back up now. 
I'm doing it. 
(telephone rings) CTU, Reynolds. 
This is Bauer. 
Patch me through to Nadia. 
I got Jack Bauer on the line. 
Put it on speakerphone. 
Jack, this is Nadia. 
Go ahead. 
Nadia, I'm at the beach. 
The component they delivered to Doyle was a copy. 
The case was loaded with explosives. 
They detonated it. 
Doyle's been badly injured. 
We need a trauma team here now. 
I'm on it. 
Aerial One. 
Aerial One, return to the drop-off point. 
As we arrived, two of my father's men and Josh were headed out to sea in a small boat. 
Jack, they just disabled Josh's tracker. 
Your father forced us to shut down satellite, so it's gonna take us a few minutes to get it back up so we can track them. 
How long is it gonna take to get reinforcements? 
Tac teams are five minutes out. 
Jack... 
how bad is Agent Doyle? 
Bad. We need 
that trauma team. 
Hurry. 
#Sir... 
Melinda said you read the flash regarding CTU's attempt to make the exchange. 
They're still trying to track the watercraft Phillip Bauer's men used to escape. 
They've had no success yet. 
Suvarov is expecting my call to confirm that we've retrieved the component. 
Well, my advice is give CTU a few more minutes before we call the Russians. 
We could still get lucky on this. 
Karen was right. 
Yes, sir. 
She certainly was. 
And I was wrong. 
Not just about... 
Karen, but about Wayne Palmer. 
I judged his performance as President unfairly. 
What he faced these past weeks was an impossible situation. 
Maybe he was right to reach out to Assad, I don't know anymore. 
You know, Tom... 
it's easy to think you've got all the answers when none of the ultimate responsibility lies with you, but... 
(sighs) Sitting in this chair... 
until you sit in this chair, you don't know anything. 
You can't know. 
Sir... 
in view of the fact that Karen was right, you might want to reconsider your punitive stance towards her. 
My decision may have been wrong, but I can't condone that kind of insubordination. 
Sir, you do not want the facts of your disagreement with Karen made public. 
And that's exactly what will happen if you prosecute her. 
After this crisis has passed, Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire quietly to their country home in Vermont. 
You will be honoring her service. 
It's just a better outcome all around. 
I'll take your advice under consideration, Tom. 
But right now, I need a real time update on CTU's progress. 
All right, sir. 
(door opens) (door closes) (sighs heavily) This is Jack. The trauma 
team doesn't believe that Doyle's injuries are life threatening, but he's gonna be blind in one, if not both eyes. 
I should've listened to you, Jack. 
You did what you thought was right. 
Is satellite back up yet? 
Any minute. 
But it'll be next to impossible to find a craft that size in the dark. 
Their boat had limited range. 
They must be meeting up with a larger vessel. 
NADIA: Jack? 
I want you to get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten-mile radius. 
Wh What are you thinking? 
My father's company, BXJ, has shelter corporations. 
They owned oil leases up ande coast. 
He didn't pick this location at random. 
I'm on it. 
All right, Jack, I'll let you know what we find. 
Thanks. 
Are you still in the clear? 
All clear. 
Good. 
Dock on the northeast side of the platform. 
Roger that. 
They'll bring the boy here? 
Yeah. 
When do I get my component? 
You get it when they deliver the boy. 
Good. 
You're making the right choice, continuing to work with us. 
Your mistakes have been totally unacceptable. 
But China is still my future. 
(sighs) (beeps) Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases through the CNC servers. 
Try the EPA database. 
Coastal leases have to have regulatory approval. 
That's a good idea. Nadia'll 
have to call in an access code. 
Right. 
Nadia... 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Oh, my God, Chloe. 
Chloe? Chloe, darling... 
You all right? 
Can someone please help me? 
Darling, darling, can you hear me? 
Can someone please help me?! 
TLFSUBTEAM http://tlfsubs.eastgame.net/  
The Americans know our location. 
We need to launch the drone before they close in. 
We'll find a way to deliver the other two bombs. 
Launch the drone. 
 I can't find the drone. 
 Readjust based on projected vectors. 
I'm doing that now, General. 
It's just not where it's supposed to be! 
Until you find it, I'll have my F-16s stay in a holding pattern. 
We figured out how the drone was able to stay hidden from our satellites. 
Whoever is piloting it is able to anticipate our repositioning directives. 
How can he do that? 
Our satellite data is being relayed to the drone pilot through a workstation here. 
We have a leak. 
We have to find out who's subverting our system. 
It is Nadia. The signature 
trace matches her computer. 
Surrender your station. 
Who are you streaming our satellite data to? 
What?! 
I will do what's necessary to get the answers I need. 
 Let her go. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
We got the drone pilot's location. 
We're not through with her, Milo. 
Jack, what's your status? 
The drone pilot is down. 
I'm at his controls now. 
The target is San Francisco. 
There is no way to deactivate the bomb remotely. 
I'm fighting a stall. 
I'm losing control of the drone. 
I need to find a place to land it now. 
None of the first responders in San Francisco are reporting a detonation. 
The bomb did not go off on impact. 
Move out! There's radioactive 
material in this area! 
We were able to take control of the aircraft, crash-landing it in an industrial park at the edge of the city. 
But in the process, the bomb's nuclear core was compromised and radioactive material was released. 
So what we're essentially dealing with is a dirty bomb. 
 Sir, it was a radiological spill. 
 It was an attack on our nation. 
I warned the ambassador, Tom. 
We were led to believe that this warning shot would be fired only in response to the detonation of a nuclear device. 
They need to see with their own eyes that I will answer this threat with an in-kind military response. 
The order's given. 
Launch the missile as soon as they're in range. 
Prep two units of fresh plasma. 
You need to keep him alive. 
Gredenko's got two more bombs out there. 
Right now this man's our only link to them. 
Jack! I just talked to CTU. 
There's a situation developing where the drone went down. 
What? 
The casing on the nuclear bomb, it cracked. 
There's been some dispersal into the atmosphere. 
How bad is the fallout? 
A dozen first-responders were exposed to high levels, but casualties should be minimal. 
Wind vectors are okay so far, and they're starting to evacuate. 
I want you to go through the pilot's databases and electronic files. 
I want you to see if you can find any link to Gredenko. 
Agent Bauer. 
 He didn't make it. 
 Damn it. 
 Buchanan. 
 Bill, it's Jack. 
What did you get from the drone pilot? 
No, he's dead. 
We've been running down leads on this end. 
So far nothing's come up on Gredenko. 
Doyle told me about the fallout, but he said it was containable? 
I'm afraid it's not that simple. 
The incident has created some serious policy complications in Washington. 
Like what? 
Vice President Daniels has ordered a nuclear strike against Fayed's country. 
What's he trying to do, start World War III? 
That'll be seen as an act of aggression against the entire Middle East. 
Which is why we have to find Fayed and Gredenko before Daniels launches the strike. 
 When is it happening? 
 Within the hour. 
Bill, that doesn't give us enough time to find Gredenko. 
I'll get back to you. 
Victor's still not answering. 
Because the Americans found him. 
The bomb was supposed to hit San Francisco ten minutes ago, but there is nothing on the news. 
Even if you're right, we are safe here. 
Victor doesn't know our location. 
So we can continue our operations safely. 
What operation? 
There is no operation. 
It's over because of you and your people. 
No, Fayed, it isn't over. 
We have two more bombs. 
I have the bombs. 
But you need me to deliver them. 
I'm the only one who can give you the targets you want. 
Come on, come on, shoot me now, or put down the gun. 
 Yeah. 
 Mark Hauser? 
 Who's this? 
 You know who it is. 
I already gave you what you asked for. 
But your employer has tightened security, so the access I paid for is no good. 
 That's not my problem. 
 It is your problem. 
It became your problem the moment you took my money. 
It'll take some time to download the new security protocols. 
How much time? 
Half an hour, maybe longer. 
I can call you when it's ready. 
 I'll be there in 40 minutes. 
 Gredenko. 
I'm hungry. 
Knock yourself out. 
There's peppers in here. 
 You like peppers. 
 Not red ones. 
 I don't eat red food, Mark. 
 Since when? 
I don't like red food. 
I'll take the peppers out, okay? 
You take care of me, Mark. 
You always take care of me. 
I do my best, Brady. 
While I'm doing this, I need you to do something for me. 
Okay. 
I need you to access some files from the mainframe at my office. 
 Can you do that? 
 Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Nadia's being processed as an enemy combatant. 
She's being transferred to a holding station in Temecula. 
Sir, I don't know if I can accept that she betrayed us, that she spied for Fayed. 
I think we're wrong. 
This is not easy for any of us. 
But the facts at hand indicate she was streaming intel from her station. 
 Mr. Buchanan. 
 What is it? 
We may have caught a break. 
What do you have? 
I've been monitoring everyone on our watch list who's ever communicated with Gredenko through phone calls or e-mails. 
The filter algorithm flagged a call that happened a few minutes ago. 
Mark Hauser. He does security 
consulting for energy companies. 
His company has contracts with dozens of chemical facilities oil fields, pipelines and nuclear power plants. 
Unfortunately the call was scrambled, but we do have Hauser's address. 
Get that address to Jack. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yeah, excuse us, guys. 
While I was stripping data from the drone pilot's hard drive, I found this. 
 What is it? 
 Remote access module. 
It's how the drone pilot breached CTU's satellite grid. 
No, the pilot got into our system because Nadia Yassir opened the door and let him in. 
No, she didn't. 
This guy got in through one of the radical web sites Nadia's been monitoring. 
The access module proves it. 
Are you saying Nadia's system was compromised and she didn't know it? 
That's right. 
That puts you in a tough position, considering you're the one who led the witch hunt against her. 
I followed standard protocols based on the information that was available at the time. 
Well, Nadia might not see it that way when she takes it up with the Justice Department. 
You know, once the dust settles today, they might want to make you an example. 
Relax, Mike. 
You took care of me in Denver, and I still owe you for that. 
But we're even now. 
Copy that. I'll get back to 
you as soon as we're there. 
 We got a lead on Gredenko. 
 How good a lead? 
We'll know soon enough. 
It's just a few miles from here. 
I want you to put together a Tac Team, we'll move out. 
I need to stay behind. 
We're still processing. 
Fine. 
Ryan, get your men together, come with me. 
Give us a minute, please. 
Sandra? 
How are you holding up? 
I can't believe this is happening. 
It doesn't feel real. 
I'm so sorry. 
Sandra. 
Unfortunately, I need to ask you for your help. 
There's an extremely volatile situation developing at the White House. 
Vice President Daniels is about to launch a nuclear strike against the Middle East. 
 A nuclear strike? 
 Yes. And the cabinet is behind him. 
I've tried arguing against it, but no one's listening. 
 Are they insane? 
 No. They're just scared. 
Before the attempted assassination on your brother, Wayne was reaching out to the Middle East governments to solicit their help in stopping Fayed. 
And it was working. 
This strike is a complete reversal of everything that he was working for. 
You want Dr. 
Welton to bring him out of the coma. 
Yes. 
And I need your consent. 
But the doctor said that he needs to remain sedated for a few days before the swelling can subside. 
Yeah, but we don't have a few days. 
Yeah, well, even if Wayne regains consciousness, we don't know what state he'll be in, physically or mentally. 
But we won't know unless we try. 
Sandra, I wouldn't dare to ask you to risk this if I did not think it was absolutely necessary for the sake of our country. 
 I'm sorry, I can't do it. 
 Sandra, please. 
I've already lost one brother. 
I can't lose another one. 
I know you did not ask for this responsibility, but like it or not, it is yours. 
Wayne Palmer is still the president of our country. 
He's the only one who can stop this from happening, and you are the only one who can give him the chance to do what he believes in. 
Give him that chance. 
Ask yourself what Wayne would want you to do. 
I'll talk to Dr. Welton. 
And God forgive me if I'm wrong. 
The USS Vickery has been detached from carrier group Falcon, which is currently on patrol in the region. 
Now, the Vickery will reach launch position in 40 minutes. 
So, in less than an hour, we'll have made our point to the enemy? 
Yes, Mr. Vice President. 
The B-611 short-range tactical warhead has a blast yield of 300 kilotons. 
The message will be loud and clear. 
Very good, Admiral. Exemplary. 
Tom, give us the damage and casualty estimates you got from COMPLAN. 
 Tom? 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 Is there a problem? 
 No. No, no. 
Um, this projection is, of course, based on theoretical models generated at our nuclear facility in Alamogordo. 
COMPLAN estimates a high range of general damage by zone, as well as multiple casualty numbers based on various climate models. 
 Now, should the... 
 I'm sorry, Tom. 
I need to step out for a minute. 
Carry on with the briefing. 
Right. Uh, 
should the enemy mount a response, the potential does exist for the US to be drawn into a conflict in which its troops... 
What the hell does this mean, they're taking him out of the coma? 
Apparently, Sandra Palmer gave her consent a few minutes ago. 
 This is Karen Hayes. 
 I don't know, sir. 
I only found out about this because I have a source inside the medical bay. 
Put me through to Dr. Welton. 
Okay. I've cut the 
pentobarbital drip. 
His metabolic rate's up, and he's breathing on his own. 
What about the swelling in his brain? 
No sign of intracranial hypertension, but it's still too early to know when or even if he'll regain consciousness. 
Dr. Welton, Vice President Daniels 
on line one. He says it's urgent. 
Dr. Welton, 
what are you going to tell him? 
The truth. 
Mr. Vice President, 
this is Dr. Welton. 
I've just been told you're trying to rouse the president out of his coma. 
That's correct, sir. 
I thought you induced the coma to save the president's life. 
Treating patients with head trauma's a fluid process. 
Sounds to me like you're risking the life of the president of the United States. 
With careful monitoring, we can minimize that risk. 
 Let's cut the crap, Doctor. 
 Sir? 
We both know what's going on here, why Sandra Palmer wants her brother conscious. 
She's trying to subvert my policy agenda. 
Policy's not my concern. 
Oh, I think you're very concerned, and I think you agree with what she's doing, and you're willing to risk the life of the president to get it done. 
So if you don't stop now, I will compel you to stop. 
With all due respect, sir, the president's medical treatment is not under... 
 You'll do what I tell you. 
 No, sir. I'm sorry, I will not. 
I am required to follow the wishes of Sandra Palmer. 
You're free to take up your concerns with her. 
If the president dies or suffers any permanent damage from your actions, I will nail your ass to the wall. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Perfectly, sir. 
Chloe, I need that photo. 
I need it now. 
Sending now, Jack. 
Team B, advise when you're in position. 
 Team B in position. 
 Copy that. 
I've got a positive ID. 
Move in on the house now, move in on the house now! 
Federal agent! 
Get on the floor! 
 Don't move! 
 Do what they say, Brady. 
Put him in a chair. 
Mark, Mark. 
Take him in the living room now. 
 Let's go. 
 He doesn't know anything. 
 Shut up! 
 Mark. 
He's got some arterial bleeding. 
We need to get him to a hospital. 
We don't have time. Do whatever 
you have to to stabilize him. 
All right. 
Let me have the room. 
I know you're scared right now, but everything's going to be okay. 
I want to see my brother. 
I'm going to let you see your brother, but I need to ask you some questions first. 
 I'm not allowed. 
 You're not allowed? Why? 
Mark says, don't talk to strangers. 
I'm not a stranger. 
I'm a police officer. 
You can talk to me. 
It's all right. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
What's yours? 
 Brady. 
 Brady. 
Brady, when we came in, you were working on your computer. 
What were you working on? 
 Getting files. 
 What kind of files? 
I don't know. 
Mark asked me to get through the IPC firewall to set up a proxy server port. 
 Oh. 
 Can I see him now? 
Soon. 
I'm going to talk to him first, and then you can see him, okay? 
You're doing great, Brady. 
Stay with him. 
You were getting paid to give Dmitri Gredenko information. 
You used your brother to get that information. 
Now he's in a lot of trouble. 
My brother's got nothing to do with this. 
That's not what he told me. 
He doesn't... 
he doesn't know what he's doing. 
That's not how the Justice Department's going to see it. 
They're going to prosecute him for treason unless I intervene. 
Now I'll help your brother because you and I both know he didn't understand what he was doing, but you're going to have to give me Gredenko. 
What kind of information were you selling him? 
 Security specs. 
 What security specs? 
The Edgemont nuclear power plant. 
Bill, this is Connell Johnson. 
He's on loan from District. 
 Connell. 
 Hey. 
We swept the drone pilot's system. 
Most of the hard drives and data files are encrypted. 
Our digital forensics people are expecting you. 
We'll see what we can find. 
Have you gotten anything more from Nadia? 
She still claims she was set up. 
 Is she in the building? 
 Yeah. 
She's being transferred to a holding facility. 
 Why do you ask? 
 Just curious. 
Sir, Jack's on line two. 
He's got Hauser in custody. 
Jack? 
Bill, Hauser admitted to selling Gredenko the security specs for Edgemont nuclear power facility. 
 Does Gredenko have the specs? 
 Not yet. 
He's going to pick them up in about 20 minutes. 
 Can your team handle the grab? 
 We've got a situation. 
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother that Gredenko knows. 
We're going to use him to go through with the transaction. 
Right now, it's the best shot we've got of getting Gredenko alive. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I've got anything. 
Brady, we need to talk. 
Are you really a policeman? 
Yeah. 
Then... my brother 
did something wrong. 
He's made some mistakes, but he's helping us fix them. 
Everyone makes mistakes. 
I make mistakes all the time. 
 And you try and fix them, right? 
 Yeah. 
That's what your brother's trying to do, but he needs your help. 
 Why don't we go talk to him? 
 Okay. 
Come on, let's go. 
Mark? Mark?! 
It's okay, Brady. It's okay. 
It's not as bad as it looks. 
They're taking me to the hospital. 
 I want to go with you, Mark. 
 You need to stay with them. 
Don't leave me alone, Mark, please. 
Listen to me, Brady. Listen. 
You need to do whatever this man tells you to do. 
You'll be fine. 
Who takes care of you, Brady? 
 You do, Mark. 
 That's right. 
So you need to trust me when I tell you you'll be fine. 
He'll take care of you. 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Let's make the call. 
 Yes. 
 It's Hauser. 
I have the security protocols, but there's a problem. 
 What problem? 
 My supervisor wants me to come in. 
 I'll be there in 20 minutes. 
 He wants me at the office now. 
If I'm not there in ten minutes, the protocols will default, and I'll have to download them all over again. 
I need those protocols. 
I can leave them with my brother. 
Brady? 
Unless you want to wait for me to get back from the office. 
I don't have time. 
Have your brother meet me in the parking lot across the street. 
He'll be there. Good-bye. 
The parking lot. 
Across the street. 20 minutes. 
He needs to get to a hospital now. 
Take him. 
Mark! Mark! 
Brady, it's all right. 
It's all right. We're going to 
take care of him, I promise. 
Right now, I need you to listen to me very carefully, just like your brother told you to. Okay? 
Okay. 
 Milo Pressman? 
 Yeah. 
Connell Johnson. I'm on loan 
from District. Data forensics. 
Yeah, I think we crossed paths in Denver. 
 That's right, we did. 
 What can I do for you? 
Well, I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends. 
Yeah. Why do you ask? 
Because I came across evidence at the switching station that proves Nadia's innocent. 
 Explain. 
 She wasn't streaming intel. 
Her system was breached. 
Where is this evidence? 
 Ask Doyle. 
 Doyle? 
I hate to be a platoon rat, but I don't know where else to go. 
I gave him the evidence at the crime scene, and he still hasn't logged it in. 
Thank you. 
Make sure Jack's team has a full surveillance package with infrared capability. 
Why'd you do it, you son of a bitch? 
 Are you crazy?! 
 Milo, hat's enough! 
Tell him! Tell... 
He's got evidence that Nadia's innocent! 
 Is this true? 
 Yeah. 
And he buried it to save his own ass. 
He didn't bury it. 
Milo. He didn't bury it. 
It's a remote access module that breached Nadia's computer. 
He gave it to me ten minutes ago. 
Why didn't you tell us about this? 
Because I got it from an unreliable source. 
I wanted to make sure it was real before I submitted it for evidence. 
I ran a verification scan. 
It's definitely real, and Nadia is definitely innocent. 
I'll review the evidence. 
If it's true, I'll release Nadia. 
In the meantime, go back to work! 
Come with me, Morris. 
Doyle... 
I owe you an apology. 
It's not your fault. 
Still. 
Milo, forget about it. 
Johnson. 
You have screwed with the wrong guy for the last time, pal. 
Uncuff her. 
Excuse us, please. 
We found evidence at the switching station. 
It proves your computer was breached from an outside source. 
You're cleared, Nadia. 
I'm sorry this happened. 
So am I. 
Your first impulse will be to quit, take legal action. 
I don't blame you. 
That's what I'd do. 
But I'm asking you to stay. 
This crisis is far from over. 
We can't afford to lose our best people. 
We need you, Nadia. 
I'll stay. 
Milo's setting up your workstation now. 
I just sent over the assault vectors. 
Nadia should be good to go. 
Thank you. 
We all thought she was guilty. 
This is going to be awkward. 
 Yeah. 
 Especially for you. 
Why especially for me? 
Your feelings for Nadia aren't exactly a big secret. 
Thank you for pointing that out. 
Your station's all set. 
Comm's up. 
You'll have full security access to the subnet. 
Thanks. 
Listen, Nadia, I just... 
Look, Milo, I don't have time for a heart-to-heart right now, okay? 
I got a lot of catching up to do. 
Excuse me. 
I understand that. Nadia, wait. 
Damn it! You're not going to 
make this easy for me, are you? 
You know what? Actually, I am. 
Whatever you thought might happen between us, you can just forget it. 
That's not fair. 
Milo, believe it or not, I don't even blame you for suspecting me. 
But you have to admit, this is not the best place to start a relationship. 
You're probably right. 
But I still wanted to say I'm sorry. 
You said it. 
I should get to work. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
We haven't heard from Dr. Welton, 
and he's been giving us regular updates. 
Well, I'm sure if there was something to report, we would have heard from him. 
Oh, gosh. I've never been 
good at waiting for anything. 
David had the patience of Job. 
But not me. 
Wayne is always somewhere in between. 
 We have a decision to make. 
 What is it? 
There's an increase in intracranial swelling. 
How serious is it? 
It's not life-threatening yet, but if it continues, it could cause permanent brain damage. 
I suggest we re-induce the coma. 
No. 
Sandra, you understand the danger? 
Yeah, but there's a chance he'd be okay. 
Yes, there's a chance. 
Well, even if it's a small chance for Wayne to stop Daniels, then it's worth the risk. 
I know Wayne would want to see this through. 
Dr. Welton? 
You need to come quickly. 
He's crashing. Get a code team in 
here right away. Wait outside! 
Code team to One! 
Code team to One, stat! 
Teams are in position. 
You sure he can do this? 
He just needs to get Gredenko out of his car. 
We don't have another option. 
Just tell Charlie team they've got one shot at this. 
Damn it. 
Brady, I need you to wear one of these. 
So we can talk to each other. 
This way, you'll be able to hear me, and I can hear you. 
 I need to put it in your ear. 
 Will, uh, it hurt? 
No. 
No, I promise. 
See? 
Now, I'm going to talk you through this. 
But we don't want Mr. 
Gredenko to know that you can hear me. 
So we have to pretend that you can't. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
Good. 
You're going to give him this. 
He's going to meet you in the parking lot across the street. 
I want you to stand on the sidewalk. 
That's your position. 
Okay. 
We're set. 
We should go now. 
You don't need to be scared, Brady. 
Everything's going to be fine. 
I'm going to be able to watch you the whole time, and I'm going to be able to hear everything that you say. 
Now, I need you to go to your position. 
You remember the position we talked about? 
Yeah. I'm going to 
go to my position. 
Okay. 
All teams, report in. 
Alpha team, in position. 
Bravo team, in position. 
Charlie team, in position. 
Charlie team, you are responsible for taking out Gredenko with the tranquilizer dart. 
Teams A and B, I want you to acquire remaining targets. 
Do whatever you have to, to protect this kid. 
Brady, it's Jack. 
Can you hear me? 
 I hear you. 
 You're doing great. 
 When can I see my brother? 
 As soon as this is over, I promise. 
Okay. Okay, good. 
I have a visual on Gredenko's SUV. 
Windows are tinted. 
I can't see who's inside. 
Brady? Do you see the car 
that's coming towards you? 
Yeah. 
It's time to get ready. 
I got a visual on Gredenko. 
Charlie team, take your shot as soon as you've got one. 
Copy that. 
 Do you have it? 
 Yeah. 
Give it to me. 
I have a negative line of sight. 
Hauser's in the way. 
You look nervous, Brady. 
Why are you so nervous? 
Gredenko just gave the order to shoot the kid as soon as the information's been verified. 
Charlie team, do you have your shot yet? 
Negative. Hauser's 
still in the way. 
 Can you move position? 
 Negative. 
Brady. Don't forget to pretend 
like you can't hear me. 
You're doing great. I want you 
to listen to me very carefully. 
When I tell you, I want you to go down to the ground and stay there. 
Wait till I tell you. 
Brady, get down on the ground. 
Brady, get down on the ground! 
All teams, take out your targets. 
All teams, there's a third hostile inside the vehicle! 
Brady. Brady, are you okay? 
It's over. It's over. 
You did great. 
 I want to see my brother. 
 Okay. 
You can see your brother just like I promised. 
Get Gredenko back in the house. 
Prep him. Contact CTU. 
Advise Buchanan that we've got Gredenko in custody and we're prepping him for interrogation. 
Yes, sir. 
Watch your head. 
Brady, this man's going to look after you. 
He's going to take you to see your brother. 
 I want to see my brother. 
 Yeah. 
You did great. Thank you. 
Okay. 
We searched Gredenko's vehicle and the surrounding area. 
 There's no sign of the bombs. 
 Is he conscious yet? 
 Yes. You want help with him? 
 No. 
You know who I am? 
I know all about you, Agent Bauer. 
Then you know what I'm going to do to you unless you tell me where the bombs are. 
And when I'm finished, I'm going to put you on the fastest plane we've got back to Russia. 
I don't think President Suvarov's going to be too happy to see you. 
 Fayed has the bombs. 
 Where is he? 
I don't know. 
But I can help you find him. 
I'm listening. 
I came here to get security specs for the Edgemont nuclear power plant. 
 That's your next target. 
 Yes. 
Fayed's waiting for my call. 
Make the call. 
No. 
First, my terms. 
Amnesty from your government. 
And a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia. 
What? 
I'm offering you Fayed. 
What's the problem? 
I'm not martyr. 
I'm soldier. And realist. 
If I don't call him soon, Fayed will get suspicious. 
Admiral Smith, is the Vickery ready to launch? 
It's seconds from optimal launch position, Mr. Vice President. 
 Good. 
 Mr. Vice President. 
 Yes, Tom? 
 Just spoke to Bill Buchanan at CTU. 
They've taken Gredenko into custody. 
Jack Bauer is questioning him now. 
Does Bill think there's a chance this could lead to something? 
Well, he's confident that Bauer's the man for the interrogation, and he's hoping they get the answers they need. 
I hope his confidence is justified. 
Sir, the Vickery's in position. 
They're standing by. 
 Proceed with the strike. 
 Yes, Mr. Vice President. 
Mr. Vice President, if I may. 
In light of the developments at CTU, do we not want to delay this launch and just see what Bauer gets out of Gredenko? 
I'm not going to delay our response based on what Gredenko may or may not reveal. 
But if Gredenko gives up the bombs, then surely that is the desired result... 
Then we can consider this strike as retaliation for American lives already lost! 
A reminder to the world there are consequences to attacking our country. 
Admiral Smith... 
proceed with the launch. 
Yes, Mr. Vice President. 
Sir, the Vickery just received a message over the COMPLAN subnet. 
They've been ordered to stand down. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
Who gave this order? 
President Palmer, sir. 
President Palmer? 
Conference Room, Lisa Miller. 
One moment. 
It's for you, sir. 
Yes. 
Noah... it's Wayne. 
Mr. President. 
It is an incredible relief to hear your voice. 
To be frank, it's a surprise. 
 I've called off the strike, Noah. 
 We just received word. 
Sir, this action is a product of careful deliberation between myself and the Joint Chiefs. 
Yeah, well, be that as it may, the decision is mine and mine alone. 
I'm resuming my duties as Commander in Chief. 
Inform Admiral Smith and the others, there's to be no hostile action without my direct authorization. 
Is that understood? 
Understood, Mr. President. 
Good. 
It's apparent to me that... 
the President is still suffering the effects from the attack on his life. 
He's not thinking clearly, and in my judgment, he's not capable of discharging his duties. 
I can't let him remain in power. 
Get me the Attorney General. 
Fayed has the bombs. 
Where is he? 
I don't know, but I can help you find him. 
RYAN: Preparing the tracker now. 
We can track the isotope signature up to 15 miles. 
(inhales sharply) MILO: We are locked on the isotope signature that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm. 
You led them to me. 
I had no choice. 
I don't like it. 
Something's wrong. 
I'm heading in. 
Which direction, Milo? 
He stopped and entered the building on the left. 
He's right on the other side of the door! 
Oh, my God. 
He cut off Gredenko's arm! 
Ryan, move your men in now! 
I want Fayed alive! 
REPORTER: But sources indicate that the same terrorist cell is most likely... 
We're trapped. 
This way. 
I recognize him from the news! 
He's the terrorist they're looking for! 
MAN: Thatis him! 
You bastard. 
Back off! 
Gredenko is not here. 
I need you to lock down the area and initiate a search! 
One of the Cabinet votes is invalid. 
The tally's seven to six in favor of invoking the 25th amendment and removing President Palmer from power. 
I'm sorry, Wayne. 
No, don't waste your apologies on me because I won't let you steal the presidency. 
As I'm sure you're aware, sir, conspiracy to commit perjury is a felony offense. 
LISA: My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favor so that you can do what's right for this country. 
NOAH: You're right. Do it. 
Turn it off. 
Wayne, the Supreme Court was just notified. 
Daniels withdrew his suit. 
You're still the President of the United States. 
President Palmer... 
What? 
He's about to go ahead with the nuclear strike. 
This makes no sense, sir! 
It's what you risked your life to stop! 
Tom, I risked my life to reassert my authority. 
Mr. President... 
...we have a successful launch. 
Good. 
Mr. President, 
the missile is just entering target's airspace. 
Mr. President... 
Tom, I said I was done talking. 
We both agreed a nuclear strike is pointless, Fayed's actions are not state-sponsored and his country cannot be held accountable for this. 
Five minutes till impact. 
The ambassador assured us he country is doing everything possible to find those suitcase nukes. 
They simply don't know anything! 
Well, one way or another, Tom, we're about to find out if that's true. 
(keypad beeps, phone rings on line) Buchanan. 
HAYES: Bill, it's me. 
Have you gotten anything from Fayed? 
Jack's interrogating him now, but frankly, he's not optimistic about breaking him. 
What's going on? 
The president's gone ahead with the missile strike. 
He what? 
He's launched it, Bill. 
Why? 
I don't know why. 
He fought the vice president to regain his office, and now he's just going ahead with Daniels' plan. 
It doesn't make any sense. 
We've got to stop this. 
Look, can I tell the president that you have a solid lead from Fayed on the location of the suitcase nukes? 
If you're asking me to provide a pretext to bring the missile down, Karen, I can't do that. 
Fayed's not talking and Gredenko's dead. 
I don't have anything. 
Okay, okay. 
I'm sorry. 
Me, too. 
I'll call you later. 
Sir, we have confirmation the radar's tagged the missile. 
They're scrambling fighters and readying air defenses, sir. 
Then they know we're coming. 
Good. 
Sir, I just got off the phone with CTU. 
Bauer's interrogating Fayed. 
It's just a matter of time before he has the location of those bombs. 
No, Karen, we can't afford to wait longer. 
Sir, we can't afford not to. 
Please, why are you doing this? 
Four minutes to impact, Mr. President. 
Mr. President... 
(intercom beeps) Yes? 
Excuse me. We have the 
ambassador on for the President. 
This is President Palmer. 
Mr. President, my government 
has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country. 
That's correct, Mr. Ambassador. 
We've made good on our threat. 
For God sake, I implore you to stop it! 
On what grounds? 
We have uncovered new information regarding your situation. 
I'm listening. 
We've identified a general in our Central Command, General Mohmar Habib, who has also been in contact with Fayed. 
It's our belief that he's been helping orchestrate the attacks on your country. 
Have you arrested Habib? 
Yes, yes. He's being 
interrogated as we speak. 
Please, you must abort this attack before it's too late. 
Does Habib know the present location of Fayed's nuclear weapons? 
It is my understanding that the general's last contact with Fayed was during the drone operation. 
He has no current knowledge of the weapon's whereabouts or their intended targets. 
Mr. President, 
two minutes to impact, sir. 
Ambassador, your government has known about this man for quite some time, haven't they? 
Mr. President, this  
development has come as a shock... 
Stop lying to me! 
That missile will hit in less than two minutes, Mr. Ambassador, 
so please don't try my patience again. 
You must understand the fragile political climate of our country. 
General Habib is a high-ranking military commander. 
I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of World War III. 
The missile will be aborted, Mr. Ambassador. 
But in the meantime, I strongly suggest you get me a full  dossier on General Habib. 
I want a thorough update on the progress of his interrogation. 
I'm also demanding that you return here to the White House immediately. 
I want direct access to you, sir, for the duration of this crisis. 
As you wish, Mr. President. 
Commander, abort code: Alpha-Zero-Delta-Nine. 
Ditch it in the Gulf. 
My God, they were lying to us all the time. 
Withholding information and you knew it. 
I suspected it. 
Well, I'll see that theVickery sends a recovery team to retrieve that nuclear warhead. 
That won't be necessary, Tom. 
The president ordered the launch of a secondary missile on board theVickery, an unarmed one. 
HAYES: What? 
This was all a bluff? 
The vice president was right. 
Well, about one thing, anyway. 
That it was going to take a willingness to strike back before getting any real cooperation from their government. 
The difference is I wasn't about to take innocent lives to prove my point. 
Now let's get this information to CTU. 
Perhaps it's the key to breaking Fayed. 
(grunts) Gah! 
This country is planning a full retaliatory strike against your people. 
Now, I can stop it, but tell me where the bombs are. 
Where are the bombs?! 
Fayed, this is over. 
You lost. 
Save your people. 
Just tell me where the bombs are. 
Are you enjoying yourself, Bauer? 
As much as you enjoyed butchering my little brother? 
Your brother was responsible for the death of dozens of innocent lives. 
Now you're responsible for thousands. 
Trust me, I haven't begun to enjoy myself. 
Go ahead. 
You'll get nothing from me, and you know it. 
We'll see. 
(gasps) (coughing) (whispering): This is not working. 
Let me have a go at him. 
No. That's exactly 
what he wants. 
He knows he's lost. 
He wants us to martyr him. 
(cell phone ringing) Hold on. 
This is Bauer. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, it's Bill. 
What's your status with Fayed? 
Same as before. 
We're getting nowhere. 
I just got some new intel from the White House. 
Fayed's government arrested one of its generals Mohmar Habib. 
Apparently, he's been running Fayed, helping him coordinate the attacks. 
Then Habib would know where Fayed's men are. 
Unfortunately not. 
He claims there's been no contact since the failed drone attack. 
They're interrogating him now. 
Well, unless Habib's going to give us something more useful than that, we still have no location for these bombs. 
We have to try something more drastic. 
How soon can you have Fayed ready for transport? 
Immediately, but... 
You really think you're going to be remembered as some great martyr for your people, Fayed? 
Yeah, you blew up a little city, and you killed a lot of people today. 
But let's face it, that's going to be of no real political significance. 
Let me tell you what's going to happen. 
Your number two guy, once he realizes that you're out of the picture, he's going to take those remaining suitcase nukes, and he's going to blow up a substantial target, something that's really going to hurt this country. 
And if, by some chance, he succeeds, he's going to be the hero of your jihad, and you will be forgotten. 
Is that what you want? 
(scoffs) Do you honestly believe you can manipulate me by playing on my vanity? 
I serve the will of God. 
No, you don't. 
And if you don't believe me, ask him when you meet him. 
(cocks gun) Agent Doyle, lower your weapon. 
I said lower your weapon! 
Buchanan wants us to transport Fayed back to CTU. 
We don't have time. 
His men are probably on the move. 
The only way we're going to break him is with a pharmaceutical package. 
Burke is standing by. 
We don't need Burke. 
Just give me some time with him. 
Those are your orders. 
Agent Doyle, do you have a problem? 
No problem. 
Good. 
Get your men ready. 
LENNOX: Excuse me, sir. 
Here's the file on Habib. 
Is this the complete dossier on General Habib? 
No, sir. 
That's preliminary. 
And I was told by the ambassador's staff that more will be forthcoming and will be relayed concurrently to CTU. 
Good. 
How soon before the ambassador gets here? 
Within 15 minutes. 
Oh, and I spoke with Secret Service. 
They said your sister is on her way back to the hospital to be with Walid. 
And she's going to call you soon. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
I did want to say, your handling of the crisis... 
Tom, I know that you're not happy that you were kept in the dark about the bluff. 
But the Joint Chiefs and I agreed to keep the plan closed. 
That's not it. 
I just want to say I'm sorry... 
I doubted your strength and your leadership. 
It's all right. 
Well, respectfully, sir, no... 
it's not all right. 
Tom... 
you and I go back a long time, so let's be honest with each other. 
You made it no secret that you believed the vice president was better suited to lead this country through this crisis. 
And I was wrong about that, sir. 
No, if that missile had detonated on foreign soil... 
Russia, China, every nation with a nuclear capability might well have inserted themselves into this. 
No, this could have been a world war. 
Unfortunately, we're already in a world war, Tom. 
It's just taken me some time to fully realize that. 
If it hadn't have been for Vice President Daniels initiating that missile launch, I would have no gambit to play here. 
And the ambassador would never have come forward with this intel on Habib. 
I'm not David, Tom. 
And I never will be. 
But I am learning that who I am is not so bad. 
Yeah, well, we're all doing some learning here today, aren't we, sir? 
Tom? 
Daniels withdrew his challenge to my competency very suddenly. 
And from what I know, without any discernible reason. 
Change of heart maybe. 
Oh, something must have changed it. 
You have something on him, don't you? 
Sir, as chief of staff, I'm here to inform you and also to protect you. 
Those jobs don't always work in combination. 
JACK: We're northbound on Washington. 
ETA about 16 minutes. 
Tell Agent Burke we're going to need everything he's got. 
Jack, what if this doesn't work? 
I've never found pharmaceutical torture all that effective. 
I have. 
If this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time. 
I won't tell you a thing. 
Whether you do or not, I get to watch you suffer. 
Agent Doyle, I don't want you talking... 
Jack! 
Watch out! 
(tires screech) Everybody okay?! 
DOYLE: Yeah. 
They're trying to flank us on both sides. 
We're sitting ducks here. 
Try and get Fayed out the back. 
I'll cover you from this side. 
DOYLE: All right. 
(automatic gunfire) (speaking Arabic) (yelling in Arabic) We're clear. 
We're clear. 
Bill, it's Jack, do you copy? 
Bill, do you copy? 
We're here, Jack. 
The cover team just picked up Fayed. 
You think he bought it? 
We'll know soon enough. 
JACK: Is the A/V feed up yet? 
We're almost there. 
Agent Doyle, you're bleeding. 
Oh, must have cut myself in the crash. 
Mike, do you need medical assistance? 
DOYLE: Uh, negative, it's superficial, but thanks for your concern. 
Jack, I'm patching it through to you now. 
JACK: Copy that. 
JAMAL: Talit, take evasive measures. 
Keep off the main streets. 
(speaking Arabic) My name is Jamal Nasawa. 
We are with the Al-Tahireen cell. 
General Habib sent us. 
The general? 
Yes. 
How did you find me? 
Through contacts the general has within the American intelligence community. 
He learned of your route and ordered us to intercept. 
He wants us to help you rendezvous with your men. 
(breathing heavily) Give me a gun. 
(speaks softly) I want to speak to him. 
General Habib. 
That's not possible at the moment. 
Why not? 
The general is under tight scrutiny by the government. 
It's not safe. 
He said he'll call us when he can. 
Fayed, where do you want us to take you? 
I'll let you know after I speak to the general. 
As you wish. 
Bill, did you copy that? 
Fayed's not going anywhere unless he talks to General Habib. 
I don't know if I can make that happen, Jack. 
We've got to make that happen. 
Otherwise, this play is going to fall through. 
We have no other way to find the bombs. 
I'll call the White House. 
I've got Bill Buchanan on the phone. 
I'm patching him through. 
Bill, you're on speaker with Tom Lennox and myself. 
So what's the situation? 
Jack Bauer wasn't able to extract any information from Fayed. 
He considered it a dead end. 
Consequently, we implemented a plan intended to trick Fayed into leading us to the location of the suitcase nukes. 
What sort of plan? 
We staged a fake rescue of Fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib. 
We hoped that Fayed would lead us to wherever his men are holed up. 
But he hasn't, right? 
No, sir. 
Fayed is stalling until he can get confirmation from Habib that these men are taking orders from him. 
He wants to speak to the general, sir. 
Habib is still being interrogated, Bill. 
We don't yet know how cooperative he's being or even if he will be. 
I appreciate that, sir. 
Our agents on the inside are trying to circumvent Fayed's request, but Jack believes Fayed will not lead us to the location of the nukes unless he speaks directly to the general. 
Where's the ambassador now? 
He arrived a few minutes ago. 
Karen Hayes is meeting him in the lounge. 
All right. 
I'll do my best to put pressure on the ambassador, Bill. 
Maybe they can force Habib to make that call. 
Keep doing what you can on your end just in case I'm not successful. 
Yes, sir, we'll keep you apprised. 
All right. 
You know, sir, if this ruse isn't working, our time might be better served getting the information out of Fayed by more conventional means. 
Tom, if Jack Bauer says that's a dead end, then it's a dead end, and I believe him. 
Let's not keep the ambassador waiting. 
Oh! Are you all 
right, sir? 
I'm fine. 
Ambassador. 
Mr. President. 
The Prime Minister has asked me to convey his gratitude to you for stopping the attack on our country and his relief that an international catastrophe was narrowly avoided. 
Well, don't get too comfortable, Mr. Ambassador, 
because there may be one yet. 
Sit down. 
Let me get right to the point. 
At this very moment, Abu Fayed is traveling with a team of CTU agents posing as a terrorist cell allied with General Habib. 
You have Fayed? 
Yeah, we do, but we don't have the suitcase nukes. 
The problem is Fayed will not rendezvous with his men until he speaks to that general, presumably to confirm the legitimacy of our undercover agents. 
So we need that phone call to take place now. 
I appreciate your dilemma, Mr. President, 
and I will gladly pass on your request. 
But I'm not sure the general would be accommodating. 
He's proven to be quite stubborn throughout his interrogation. 
Well, perhaps you should be a little bit more persuasive. 
I resent your tone. 
I don't need you to tell me how dire the situation is. 
This is not a moment for your indignation, considering it's your country's own inactions that have brought us to this point. 
I can assure you, every effort is being made to get information from him. 
We have even arrested his family. 
Have you threatened to kill them? 
I beg your pardon? 
Mr. President... 
These are desperate times for us, Mr. Ambassador. 
I spared your country a nuclear strike that would have killed thousands. 
What is your country willing to do to insure that another bomb does not go off in mine? 
What you're suggesting is barbaric. 
I'm fully aware of how your country treats political dissidents. 
So don't you dare speak to me of barbarism. 
Now I don't care how you do it, but General Habib needs to call Fayed and give him his orders directly without compromising CTU's operation. 
You'll make the call now. 
Nadia... 
if General Habib makes the call, it'll be to Jamal's phone, but the general doesn't speak English. 
I'll set up a separate channel and translate their conversation. 
Milo, I need you to uplink a proprietary channel on socket D to my terminal. 
I can't. I'm busy. 
Why don't you just do it yourself? 
Because I don't have level five security clearance. 
Hasn't stopped you before, now, has it? 
Milo, is there something on your mind? 
I just don't get it. 
A few hours ago, Doyle was threatening you, hurting you. 
You were barely talking to me and now, what, you two are best buddies? 
Just because I showed concern for an injured field agent Concern...? 
doesn't make us friends. 
Milo, besides, he might not as bad as you think he is. 
No. He is. 
The guy is a creep and a sadist. 
You know what? 
I don't have time for this. 
I can have Chloe do it. 
It's fine. 
Wait, that's it? That's 
all you're going to say? 
Let go of me. 
Psst. 
I know it's none of my business, but do we have a bit of a problem? 
No. 
I'll set up your channel. 
Thank you. 
You all right, love? 
Yeah. Thanks. 
Don't mention it. 
(labored breathing) Pull into that garage up there. 
We'll wait there. 
JACK: Stop right up here. 
Fayed, I understand your caution. 
But we can't just sit here while the Americans are looking for us. 
I told you-- we're not going any further until the general calls. 
Tell me, Jamal. 
FAYED: If you take your orders from General Habib as I do, how is it I've never heard of you or your cell? 
This is going south, Jack. 
Just be patient. 
Don't be a fool, Fayed. 
You know how this works. 
Every cell is autonomous, without the knowledge of what the others are doing. 
It is the only way that we can protect ourselves and our operations should any of us get captured. 
(phone rings) Yes? 
(speaking Arabic) The general. 
Alloo? 
HABIB: Fayed... 
(speaking Arabic) NADIA (over radio): "Fayed, I can't speak long. 
I suspect I'm being watched." 
(Fayed speaking Arabic) "So I was told." 
General... 
"General..." 
"these men who rescued me, did you send them?" 
(speaking harshly in Arabic) "Of course I sent them." 
"Do you still have the bombs?" 
(speaking Arabic) "There are two left. 
They're with Halil at a safe house." 
(Habib speaking Arabic) "Why haven't you used them?" 
(Fayed speaking Arabic) "The Russian Gredenko failed to provide us with the means to a secondary target." 
(speaking Arabic) "You failed, Fayed." 
(speaking Arabic) "I should have sent Sameer in your place." 
(speaking Arabic) "Are the bombs operational?" 
"They are." 
"Good." 
"Connect with your men, "get the bombs ready to move out, "call me back at this number. 
"By then, I will have chosen a new target for you. 
Do you understand?" 
Na'am, General. 
"Yes, General." 
Are we good? 
The safe house isn't far. 
Head east toward the 110 Freeway. 
Target vehicle is moving. 
Copy that, Jack. 
Looks like it worked. 
I'll let the White House know. 
Let's go. 
Mr. President? 
Are you feeling all right? 
I'm fine, Karen. 
Just a... 
just a little tired. 
Mr. President, 
I just got word from CTU. 
The general's phone call appears to have satisfied Fayed. 
He's leading them to the safe house and the bombs. 
Oh, thank God. 
I'm pleased we were able to help, Mr. President. 
(Wayne clears throat) (strained): So am I. 
Karen, would you please show the ambassador to his car. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
AMBASSADOR: Forgive me, Mr. President, 
but I believe you asked me to remain here until the crisis is resolved. 
That won't be necessary any longer. 
Thank you again for your cooperation. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
You handled him well, sir. 
(strained): The door, Tom. 
Excuse me, sir? 
What...? 
The door, lock it. 
Mr. President... 
No one can know. 
Sir! 
All shadow teams for Bauer and Doyle have checked in and are standing by. 
They're ready to advance the moment Fayed arrives at the safe house. 
No one moves until Jack calls with confirmation that the nukes are there. 
Make sure Fayed's vehicle and the follow car have a wide berth. 
No choppers in the area. 
Nothing to tip Fayed off. 
Right. 
Sir... 
I think we have a problem. 
What is it? 
I analyzed the transcript between General Habib and Fayed. 
There's an inconsistency. 
During the conversation, the general mentioned a man named Sameer. 
That's right. 
According to the inter-agency database, a Sameer Al-Afted served on the general's staff throughout the '90s. 
He was later implicated in money laundering for various radical organizations. 
Well, that's probably the guy. 
Yeah, well, the problem is, Sameer Al-Afted was killed two years ago in a raid by Afghan forces. 
But the general spoke about him as if he were alive. 
Okay, he could be referring to another Sameer. 
Or it could be a code. 
I think the general was trying to tell Fayed that he was speaking under duress. 
I'd better warn Jack and Doyle. 
Nadia... 
Good work. 
Jack... 
they're turning north onto Adams. 
Jack, we just detected what might be a duress code in the conversation between General Habib and Fayed. 
Give us the specifics. 
The general mentioned sending in a man named Sameer Al-Afted. 
But Sameer's been dead for two years. 
Give me your phone, we need to call Jamal. 
Jack, if they're wrong, you could blow this. 
If they're right, this is already over. 
Now give me your phone! 
(phone rings) Yes? 
JACK: Jamal, this is Agent Bauer. 
I'm in the follow vehicle behind you. 
I need you to listen to me very carefully. 
Go ahead. 
We believe that General Habib may have given Fayed a duress signal. 
Fayed might know that this is a setup. 
Jamal? Jamal, do you copy? 
(static crackling) Damn it, what the hell just happened? 
CTU, we just lost video and audio. 
They went into a tunnel about a quarter of a mile ahead. 
It may just be interference. 
How long is it? 
Checking. 
It's only 120 yards long. 
They should've come out the other side by now. 
Copy that. 
Aerial One, this is Jack Bauer. 
We have lost the target vehicle. 
It entered a tunnel on Adams. 
We need you to seal off the north end. We're going in. 
PILOT: Roger. On our way. 
We got a visual on the target vehicle. 
It stopped in the middle of the tunnel. 
We're going to engage. 
(tires screeching) Now. 
Dead. 
They're both dead. 
Jamal's still alive. 
Stay with him. 
Call in a medic. 
Aerial One, did you see anything leave the north end of the tunnel? 
Aerial One, do you copy? 
(door slams) * * (grunting) (panting) It's me. I'm on my way 
to you now. 
I'll explain when I get there. 
(gears grinding) (engine roaring) Bill, it's Jack! Do you copy?! 
Jack, go ahead. 
Fayed is in a sanitation truck headed east! 
Jack, say again. 
We didn't get that. 
Damn it! 
(transmission static) Jack? 
(static continues) Jack? 
The signal's gone. 
There's no contact from Agent Doyle. 
Aerial One says they're still inside the tunnel. 
Send the call to audio forensics, see if they can pull what Jack said. 
Chloe, replay the satellite feed. 
Back-time it 60 seconds. 
Yes, sir. 
Bill, this is Doyle. 
I don't have a twenty on Jack. 
But I have a dead body at the loading dock. 
Doctor, what is happening to him? 
His blood pressure's dropped. 
It's 80/40. 
It could be any number of things: vascular damage from the adrenaline shot, intracranial swelling... 
Mr. President? 
We have to get you down to Medical. 
No. 
No, I'm not going anywhere. 
(groaning) Just give me another shot of adrenaline. 
No, sir. 
Another injection would kill you. 
I should never have given you that last one. I won't make 
that mistake again, I'm sorry. 
Sir, what are you doing? 
I'm going back to work. 
Would you please listen to this man. 
Let him perform some tests. 
When this crisis is over, Tom, and those nukes are secured. 
In my opinion, you won't last that long. 
I might surprise you. 
Mr. President... 
if you don't get down to Medical right now, you can have my resignation. 
I won't accept your resignation, Arthur, so don't bother. 
Now, please... 
will you excuse us? 
(labored breathing) (whispering): For God's sake, talk some sense into him, Tom. 
It is his decision. 
Tom... 
call CTU. 
I want to know what's happening. 
All right, sir. 
All right. 
HALIL: What's going on, Brother Fayed? 
What happened? 
FAYED: Gredenko betrayed us. 
He led CTU right to me. 
What?! 
They may be tracking me. 
It's not safe here. 
Load the bombs onto the truck. 
We're leaving. 
Where are we going? 
To finish this. 
We're going to take out downtown Los Angeles. 
Let's move! 
You wait here. 
You guys, come with me. 
(bones cracking, low groaning) (gate and chains rattle) (Fayed speaking Arabic) (three gunshots) (gunfire, men shouting) (groaning) (both grunting, shouting) (groaning) (grunting) (pained shouting) (pained groaning) Say hello to your brother. 
(choking) (helicopter blades whirring) Jack? Jack? 
(panting) You all right? 
Yeah. I'm fine. 
How'd you find me? 
Well, we tracked the sanitation truck by satellite. 
Bombs are on the table. 
CTU, this is Doyle. 
We're on site. 
The bombs are secure, and Jack's all right. 
Repeat, the bombs are secure. 
Damn, Jack. 
Let's get you to Medical. 
(groaning): I'm fine. 
(cell phone ringing) Doyle. 
(chamber clicks) You got a call. 
It's being routed through CTU switchboard. 
Thanks. 
This is Bauer. 
Hello? Hello? 
WOMAN (over phone): Jack... 
are you there? 
Can you hear me? 
Audrey? 
Help me, Jack. 
Please, help me. You... 
What the hell is going on? 
Audrey, where are you? 
CHENG: Hello, Mr. Bauer. 
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive. 
If you wish her to remain that way, you will call me back in ten minutes at 310-597-3781 on a secure line. 
If you make any attempt to find our location, she dies. 
Cheng... Cheng! 
(dial tone drones) =TLF SUB TEAM= http://tlfsub.eastgame.net 
This was the last model the Soviets produced. 
Is this what you need to reprogram the trigger? 
Yes. 
So in a little less than an hour, it will detonate and strike a blow that the Americans will never forget. 
When you're finished, meet me at the safe house. 
I think some people in this place have a connection with the terrorist attacks. 
How would you know that? 
There was one phrase they used several times. 
"Khamsa ziwar." 
Pass that on to the FBI. 
I've just approved the written agreement with Assad. 
I'm prepared to offer you full protection and a pardon for all crimes or acts of war in the past. 
Is that acceptable to you? 
I need to see this pardon in writing. 
You were right about Curtis and Assad having a past connection. 
Curtis was in the army just after Desert Storm. 
His squad was embushed by Assad's people. 
They killed 5 of Curtis's men and took 2 more hostage. 
Assad's Lieutenant personally beheaded them both. 
Oh my God! 
You still don't remember? 
Special Forces battalion... 
Curtis, put your weapon down! 
Stay out of it, Jack! 
I can't. 
I gave him my word that we would protect him. 
I can't let this animal live. 
Curtis didn't leave you any choice. 
That's what I keep trying to tell myself. 
We're gonna find that suitcase nuke because of you. 
Tell the President I'm sorry. 
I can't do this anymore. 
We believe we've found the suitcase nuke. 
The tac team is ready. 
Do it now! 
Do it! 
I just got a message from the FBI. 
It's some Arabic phrase. 
Khamsa ziwar. 
It means "five visitors". 
Assad said "visitor" was a code word for "weapon". 
Four more of theses things are out there. 
The unthinkable has happened. 
Terrorists have exploded a nuclear weapon on our soil. 
Over one square mile of Valencia, a suburb of Los Angeles, has been destroyed by the most devastating attack in a series of terrorists activities that began eleven weeks ago. 
And one can only imagine the cost in lives and the suffering of survivors. 
Judging from the direction in which the mushroom cloud is heading, winds from the South may be blowing the airborne radiation away from the more heavily populated area zone. 
How many people died in this? 
Initial estimate : no less from 12.000. 
Mr. President, I just got off the phone 
with Bill Buchanan at CTU. 
He has intel that four more tactical nuclear weapons were stolen along with the one that went off. 
Do we have any idea where they are? 
We do not. 
I want a meeting with the Joints Chiefs, Tom, right away. 
I've already let them know. 
Has the civilian air traffic been shut down? 
Yes, the FAA gave the order as soon as they were informed about the bomb. 
Mr. President. 
Given the current situation, we decided to move you down to the bunker. 
Alright. 
But Tom, I have to get in front of the American people. 
Ellen, I want to make a televise speech within the hour. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Alright, let's go David. 
The Department of Emergency Services and Public Safety are urging everyone to return home. 
We'll have an expert in nuclear physics in our program in just a few minutes. 
Nadia. 
Have we heard from any of the secondary teams that were converging on Fayed? 
We lost communication as soon as the blast hit. 
Milo, can you get a visual? 
I just checked the satellite. All... 
All of our field teams were too close to ground zero. They're all dead. 
What was the last thing you heard from them? 
They were engaged with the hostiles. 
Which means they were closing in on Fayed. 
We need to know if he was in the radius when the bomb went off. 
Absolutely. 
Mr. President... 
your office has been prepared. 
The continuity of operations plan has also been activated. 
The Vice President has been alerted, and is following protocol. 
The Joint Chiefs, and most of the Cabinet members are on they way here. 
Remaining Cabinet members have been routed to site-R. 
Right this way, sir. 
Bill ? Are you alright? 
We're upwind of the blast. 
We're fine. What's going on over there? 
Secret Services moved us down to the bunker and the President is about to meet with the Joint Chiefs. 
Do you have anything new? 
Here is what we know. 
The bomb went off as we were moving in on Fayed's safe house. 
Do you think their presence prompted the detonation? 
It could have. 
It's possible they were just prepping the bomb in Valencia and hoping to move it to a more populated area. 
Is there any chance that Fayed could still be alive and have those four other bombs? 
We don't know. 
We're running the intel, now. 
 And what about Assad? 
 He's on his way here. 
We're hopping he can help us find Fayed. 
Alright, keep me in the loop. 
And Bill, please... 
 be careful. 
 I will. 
It's a lot to process. 
It's so many people! 
Yeah. 
And Curtis? I can't believe this. 
I know you and him were friends. 
Why do people I know keep dying? 
Did you find anything about Fayed? 
No, we're still repositioning satellites. 
We don't know where he is, yet. 
We got massive packet lost. 
Do you want to help me boot up routers? 
Who wouldn't? 
Open etudes five. 
I have a very bad feeling about everything. 
Do you know, Jack quit? 
Yeah, Buchanan said he's off channel. 
What's that all about? 
I'm sure it's because he was forced to kill Curtis. 
You know I'm here for you, alright? 
Yeah, I do. 
Over here! 
The authorities discovered our location. 
The bomb never reached its target. 
Damn'it, Fayed! 
I sold those weapons to you. 
The least you could have done was warn me before you blow them up in my city! 
I told you it was not supposed to happen the way it happened. 
It's a little late for apologies, don't you think? 
My engineer died in the blast. 
The device used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed as well. 
And that's my problem, why? 
I have four more bombs whose triggers need to be made operational. 
Sorry, Fayed. 
I'm going to Vegas. 
Find me a way, McCarthy. 
I'll pay you more. Double the amount 
from our previous transaction. 
That's interesting. 
You need someone who could replicate what that device did. 
With modern equipment. 
We're talking pretty advanced stuff. 
I'd have to do some checking. 
Do you know someone who can do this? 
Even if I find someone who can, I doubt they will, this is over the line. 
I don't care, how you get them to comply. 
I need someone within the next few hours. 
Are you in, or not? 
I'll do some research and get back to you. 
Help! 
Somebody, help! 
Look, I can get through the 911! 
Could you... help! 
I need a doctor! 
I need a doctor! 
Sorry, get out of my way! 
Please, our helicopter, it went down. 
And there're two others. 
One's dead, one's incouncious. 
I don't know what to do. Please 
Please, help me! 
I'm sorry, show me. 
I don't even remember anything hitting us. 
It went out of control. 
You were hit by a shockwave. 
A shockwave of what? 
Nuclear bomb. 
Do you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Chuck, is that you? 
Yeah, I brought help. 
We're getting you out of here! 
Be careful, it's about to fall. 
It's jammed. 
Ready? 
One... two... three. 
Go! 
Stay here! 
Are you okay? 
I think so. 
This guy says it's a nuclear bomb. 
It's Valencia. It's where I live. 
My wife and kids are there... 
You can't go back to Valencia, the radiation will kill you. 
Jeff, don't, you'll die! 
 CTU. 
 It's Jack Bauer. 
 Let me speak to Buchanan. 
Right away. 
If you want to save your friend, don't let him go back home. 
 Jack, you're alright? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm still in Granada Hills. 
Good, you're upwind of the blast. 
Don't go any further North. 
 How bad is it? 
 It took out a square mile. 
Do we know if this was Fayed's endgame? 
It wasn't. 
There're four more nukes out there. 
You need to pick me up. 
You said you were out? 
Not after this. 
Alright, tell me where you are. 
I'll send a car. 
I am at the corner of Glasgow and 15th. 
We'll be there. 
Colonel, Fayed has to be at least partially state-supported. 
Have your guys identified a country? 
Not yet, sir. 
CIA has narrowed down the list. 
It's on your screen in the short brief section. 
Have you been in touch with the ambassadors of these countries? 
Yes, sir. 
They all extend their condolences and have, of course, disavowed any role in the attacks. 
Well, we know at least one of them's lying. 
Maybe all of them. 
I'm not sure we know that, John. 
But let's say it is true what are you suggesting? 
We have carriers on standby in the Persian Gulf. 
They have the capability of striking multiple targets in each of these states. 
We've been playing games with these terrorists for 11 weeks now. 
The only language they understand is force. 
So let's speak it to them real clearly. 
I guarantee you that if each of these countries had to sustain three major metropolitan nuclear strikes, they'd no longer have the time or the resources to play in our sandbox anymore. 
These people want to live in the Stone Age I say let's put them there. 
Admiral, I am very sure that your emotions are shared by many in this room  and across this country... 
 These are not just emotions. 
 Our duty demands we defend... 
 The President is talking, Admiral. 
Do not interrupt. 
We will retaliate, Admiral. 
But we will do so, sir, carefully and with our sights locked on our enemy and only our enemy. 
Karen, what has CTU learned about the remaining weapons? 
They're assessing the initial satellite intel and forensic data. 
So what do we know? 
We're assuming that the bomb was meant to be detonated in a more populated area and was only being assembled in Valencia. 
By the scientist that I released. 
Yes. 
The scientist was killed in the blast, and CTU is trying to determine where Fayed was at the time. 
The worst-case scenario is that he is still alive and in possession of the remaining nuclear weapons. 
Tell them we're safe. 
That we're moving away from it now. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
this is Hamri Al-Assad. 
Mr. Buchanan's Director of CTU. 
Mr. Buchanan, I know 
that you see me as your enemy. 
But today... 
I assure you I am not. 
Follow me. 
There. All right? 
Why are we going out of our way treating Assad, one of the most violent terrorists of our time, like a VIP? 
No holding room. 
Audience with the White House? Sure. 
How would you like your mineral water, Mr. Assad, room temp? 
Please have a seat. 
Ready? 
Bill Buchanan, Director of CTU, Los Angeles. 
I'm here with Hamri Al-Assad. 
Less than 30 minutes ago, Abu Fayed detonated a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles. 
We have reason to believe he's still at large with four more tactical nuclear weapons in his possession. 
 Four? 
 That's right. 
Please, you must understand. 
I came to the United States to stop Fayed I knew he intended to inflict damage, but I did not know he was in possession of nuclear weapons. 
But he is. 
Which means there has to be a trail. 
There had to have been many people involved in the planning of this. 
This attack was planned after Fayed betrayed me six months ago. 
When he learned of your intention to broker a peace plan? 
Which I still intend to do. 
But you knew Fayed was coming to the United States. 
This information came to me only days before  the first attacks began. 
 From whom? 
I am a well-informed man, Mr. Buchanan. 
Are there any other paths you can think of  that can lead us to Fayed? 
 Yes. 
The source. 
 The source of the bomb. 
 About a year ago I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex-Soviet General about the cache of tactical nuclear weapons. 
But there was no transaction at the time. 
What was the name of the General? 
Dmitri Gredenko. 
Can you tell me anything about Gredenko? 
Nothing. Nothing. 
I've never met the man. 
Continue questioning him. 
I'm gonna check this out. 
Gredenko. You got that, Chloe? 
Yeah, I'm opening a Russian database now. 
Let me know what you find out, Chloe. 
Wait, what's this file with Gredenko's name on it? 
It's a link we're using as a match basis, Milo. 
 Mind your own business. 
 I know, I understand that. 
I just compiled a list of names, people in L.A. 
who had contact with Gredenko on business channels. 
 That's a lot of names. 
 Yes. But one of them 
kind of floated to the top, if you know what I mean. 
Put it on Buchanan's screen. 
Yes, yes, they'll fly him up. 
All right. 
Morris just put something on your B window. 
Gredenko contacts. Good. 
Look at number 17. 
Chairman of BXJ Technologies. 
Phillip Bauer. 
Jack's father. 
Did you get anything more specific? 
No. BXJ does a lot of business 
in Eastern Europe. 
This could be a purely coincidental linkage. 
Yeah, what if it's not? 
Most of their contracts are highly confidential, but I'll look into it. 
 You calling Jack? 
 Yeah. 
 This is Bauer. 
 Jack, Assad just gave us the name of a Russian General Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes. 
The general's name is Gredenko. 
Do you know him? 
It turns out your father does. 
My father? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, Gredenko did business with BXJ Technologies, specifically with your father. 
 What kind of business? 
 We don't know. 
That's why we want to talk to him. 
Bill, I don't understand is my father a suspect? 
No. His name came up 
on a list of people who have had contact with Gredenko. 
We're gonna question him. 
I wanted to check with you first to see if you could shed any light. 
I haven't spoken to him for over nine years. 
All right, we'll send someone over to talk to him. 
Bill, wait. 
I should do this. 
Jack, we can run this. 
You don't have enough time. 
He'll talk to me if I go alone. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
All right, tell Stokes we'll pick him up-- you take the car. 
 Let me know what you find out. 
 Thanks, Bill. 
You need to pull over. 
Yes, he is, but I don't know exac... 
The FBI's here. 
I got to go. 
Why did they send you? 
Believe me, Miss Palmer, I didn't want to arrest you or your friend. 
This is Agent Jennings. 
He'll be working this with me. 
Well, what exactly will you be doing? 
Walid overheard some conversations about the bombs. 
He heard a fragment of a conversation. 
If there is an active cell inside that detention facility, we need Walid to find out more. 
Agent Jennings will be putting a wire on him. 
Putting a wire on him? 
I thought you were gonna be replacing him with an undercover operative. 
Walid isn't trained to do something like this. 
Well, he's already in place. 
He's established a confidence. 
How will you be putting a wire on him? 
Just... let us do our job. 
Have you heard anything more? 
About what? 
About what's going on out there. 
How would I know that? 
I thought... 
I was just wondering if you... 
knew anything. 
No more than you, my brother. 
I'm sorry, I have to get back. 
Sure. 
Walid Al-Rezani. 
Yes? 
You and I have to talk. 
About what? 
You don't ask the questions, you son of a bitch. 
I do. 
Get out. 
We know who you're involved with. 
I told your people, I work for the IAA. 
I'm not involved in any kind of terrorist activities. 
 You're lying! 
 I'm no terrorist. 
You're lying! 
What's he doing to him? 
What do you know?! 
Don't worry. He's not going to hurt him. 
It's just for show. 
That doesn't sound just for show. 
Miss Palmer, I advised you to leave. 
If you want to stay, keep your comments to yourself. 
You're gonna explain to us what we found in your wallet. 
What are you talking about? 
You know damn well what we're talking about! 
He's wiring you. 
It's a two-way radio. 
Now, you're gonna tell me what we found in your wallet. 
You understand me? 
What do you know about this guy? 
This is ridiculous. 
Sit down. 
Tell me now, or I'll take you to the interrogation room. 
 You don't want that. 
 I'm not telling you anything. 
I don't care what you do to me. 
You will. 
You're gonna say that I asked about this man. 
You gotta make them believe you're working for them. 
I'll be back for you. 
What did they do to you? 
Nothing. 
I'm fine. 
They think they can do anything to us, those bastards. 
We've got a clear signal. 
Sam, is that you? 
Yes. Who's this? 
It's Jack. 
How are you, Sam? 
We thought you were... 
Where are you calling from? 
I'm in Los Angeles. 
Listen, Sam, I need to speak to my father. 
It's really important. Is he there? 
 No, he's not. 
 Where is he? 
He left yesterday without telling me where he was going. 
I haven't heard from him since. 
Can I reach him on his cell? 
He left it here. 
I must admit, it's all a bit mysterious. 
I tried calling your brother. 
He didn't know either. 
Where is Gray? 
Well, he was at work earlier, but who knows now? 
Can I get his cell number? 
Yeah. 818... 
555-0175. 
Okay, I got it. 
Sam, listen to me. 
If you speak to him, tell him to get back to me at this number. 
 Did it show up on your screen? 
 Yes It's really important. 
I hope you find your father soon. 
I know he would want to talk with you. 
He... regrets the way things 
ended between the two of you. 
Yeah, me, too. 
Be well, Jack. 
Thanks, Sam. 
Yeah. 
It's Liddy. 
You'll never guess who just called here. 
Who? 
Your brother, Jack. 
What are you talking about? 
Jack's rotting away in some Chinese prison. 
No, actually he's here in L.A. 
How the hell did that happen? 
I don't know. 
 What does he want? 
 He's looking for the old man. 
 Yeah, why? 
 He didn't say. 
But if I were you, I'd expect a call from Jack. 
Your name came up. 
Damn it, we should have killed Jack when we had the chance instead of handing him over to the Chinese. 
We tried. 
This isn't good. 
My brother has a way of digging things up that need to stay buried. 
It's me, Jack. 
Yeah. 
Sam said you called, but I didn't believe him. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Is everyone safe over there? 
Yeah, yeah, we're, we're cool, Jack. 
It's blowing my mind hearing from you like this. 
I want you to know that when we found out that you were in China, we tried everything to get you out. 
We called in a lot of favors. 
Thanks. 
How did you get out? 
 Some sort of exchange. 
 Yeah? For what? 
I'm not really sure. 
It must have been one hell of an exchange. 
Listen, Gray, I'm working with CTU right now. 
I'm trying to help them out with something. 
Yeah, Sam said that you were... 
you were trying to find Dad? 
Yeah. Where is he? 
I don't know. He took off yesterday 
without saying where he was going. 
I assume he went to visit one of his girlfriends. 
One of them's really hot, if you can believe that. 
Why did he leave without his cell phone? 
I guess he just didn't want to be bothered. 
Gray, I need your help. 
I need to find him. It's important. 
Yeah, whatever you need, Jack. 
I'll make a few phone calls. 
Can I get back to you at this number? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. You got it. 
Thanks. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, I need you to help me find an address  Whose? 
 Graem Bauer. 
 Your brother? 
 Yeah. 
It should be in my family file. 
I haven't seen him in years. 
Is he still in Malibu? 
No, he's in Indian Falls. 
226 Pine Crest Road. 
Do you want his cell phone number? 
I already have it. 
I just talked to him. 
Why didn't you ask him where he lives? 
I'll get back to you. 
California Highway Patrol wants to make it clear that it is essential their emergency personnel be allowed to reach those injured in Valencia. 
So, please keep the streets clear. 
Once again, a nuclear bomb has gone off in Valencia, California. 
 The President  Dad. 
will adress the nation within a half hour. 
You and your mom doing okay? 
Yeah. I mean, on the news 
they're talking about nuclear fallout. 
We'll be fine. 
Look, we're actually safer now. 
They've made their big show in L.A. 
with this nuke. 
Whatever's gonna happen next, it's gonna be in another city. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
Josh, I need to talk to your mom alone  for a minute. 
 All right. 
I just got off the phone with my brother, Jack. 
How? 
I thought the Chinese were holding him. 
He's back in Los Angeles. 
It's impossible. 
Apparently not. 
He's looking for Dad. 
Is he coming here? 
Why? 
 Are you hoping he will? 
 Don't go there, Gray. 
We're already there. 
I'm just looking for a little honesty. 
You weren't over Jack when we got married, and you're still not. 
Okay, how's this for a little honesty? 
Insecurity in a grown man is not attractive. 
"The latest terrorist incident"? 
This was a nuclear bomb! 
Can we call it what it is? 
We thought it would give the President a little more flexibility. 
Once you mention the word "nuclear," they're not gonna hear anything else. 
No, actually, Ellen, they will hear the truth. 
Everybody in this country knows what happened today. 
And now they're looking for reassurances that no matter how ugly this thing is, the President is in charge. 
Listen. 
We don't have any tangible leads and confidence is low. 
Now, if I go out there and I lie to the American public and tell them that we're on top of this, and then some other bomb goes off somewhere... 
they won't believe a single word I say. 
That can't happen. 
I agree, sir, and that's why I see an opportunity here. 
Opportunity? 
This bomb is going to remove any remaining doubt that we should be taking more aggressive measures, suspension of certain freedoms. 
Internment, deportation. 
Now is the time to start hitting those topics. 
Tom, you are counseling that we embrace the politics of fear. 
I am saying that we embrace reality. 
We are afraid, but if fear consolidates public support for measures that save our nation from extinction, then you bet, I'm in support of fear. 
Tom, the people cannot be any more afraid than they are now. 
I would like this message to have a calming effect. 
Yes, we will call this a nuclear bomb, because that is what it is, but if we expect civil order on those streets, we cannot stoke the panic. 
We're not gonna mention policy in this speech. 
The American public just needs to know that every single member of this administration is working with the single purpose of restoring order and making our streets safe again. 
I don't need a list of names. 
I need one person who can do the job. 
I'll get back to you. 
What took you so long? 
Why couldn't you just pick me up at my place, huh? 
Instead of leaving me on some street corner looking like some hooker. 
Just get in the car. 
Do not... 
talk to me... 
like one of your bimbos. 
You got me? 
They just said on the news that if the wind changes... 
we're screwed. 
I just want to get out of the city and get to Vegas. 
We're not going to Vegas. 
Oh, no. 
I'm not going to Palm Springs... 
Again. No, no. That's where 
you can just drop me off right here. 
That place is like assisted living for an entire city. 
We're not going there either. 
We have some things we gotta do here first. 
What are you talking about? 
A nuclear bomb just went off, like 25 miles from here. 
I'm talking about a lot of money. 
 Now, shut up. 
 Darren. 
Stop talking... 
now! 
Things are looking up. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means I might be able to find someone to do your dirty work. 
How soon? 
I expect to have some good news within the hour. 
Just make sure my money is ready to wire. 
The money is ready now. 
McCarthy'll find someone for us. 
Tell the men these bombs will go off today as scheduled. 
Finished with Assad. 
He gave me a few more names, but nothing that he thought would help. 
What else did he say? 
He wants peace. 
You believe him? 
Yeah. 
The President would like you transported to Washington DC. 
You'll be leaving out of Port Hueneme on a military jet. 
Some of the information you gave us checked out. 
Good luck here in Los Angeles. 
I hope the worst is over. 
Thank you. 
Sir, the FBI just upgraded one of their leads. 
They're sending us live audio we should monitor. 
What kind of audio? 
They've wired a guy at the Anacostia Detention Facility. 
They think one the detainees may have information about Fayed. 
Give it to Chloe. Make it a priority. 
 Walid should not be doing this. 
 He's going to be okay. 
 That is not the point. 
 This was his decision. 
And it was the right one. 
Usually it takes weeks or months to develop a cover. 
He might be able to find something out within hours. 
If this works, he'll have done a heroic thing for his country. 
Please don't give me speeches, okay? 
"If it works?" What if it doesn't? 
What if they find out he's wearing a wire? 
The guards inside know what's going on. 
They'll keep an eye on him. 
 Right. 
 You know, it's probably not the best thing that you're here. 
I've told you before Walid is my client. 
I know what you told me, and frankly that carries no weight with the FBI. 
Now let's be honest. 
The only reason you're here, is you're the President's sister. 
Then you remember that and we'll be fine. 
You don't have any trouble bending the rules when it's to your advantage, do you? 
What did they want with you? 
I shouldn't bring you into this. 
It's all right. 
You can talk to me. 
I heard the guard say he found something in your wallet. 
Yeah, they confiscated it. 
What was it? 
What did he find? 
A phone number. 
Whose? 
Listen to me. 
If you and I are in the same situation here, we should know each other. 
Talk to me. 
Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved. 
I met some people through my organization. 
What organization is that? 
The IAA. 
I'm regional director. 
Go on. 
Most of what we do has no... teeth. 
I was introduced to a man who was more active. 
I wanted to help him. 
That's good. 
We set up a meeting but before I had a chance, I was grabbed. 
Who is this person? 
Abu Fayed. 
You know him? 
But, please... 
Join us, brother. 
He did that well. 
What happens now? 
He's going to have to sell himself to the others before they open up. 
I-- didn't know that you were coming here. 
We need to talk. 
Yeah, sure, yeah. Come on in. Come on. 
Damn, Jack, it's good to see you. Good to see you. 
You've never been here before, have you? 
God, when was the last time we saw each other? 
When Teri died. 
That's right. The funeral. 
Have you found Dad yet? 
No, no, I made some calls but so far noth... 
Hey, Josh! 
Come here. 
This is your Uncle Jack. 
You two have not seen each other in a long time. 
Hey. 
Hi, Josh. 
How you doing? 
Okay, I guess. 
It's kind of been a weird day. 
Yeah, I know. 
Josh, give your father some privacy. 
Maybe we can talk later. 
I would like that. 
Marilyn, I'm sorry for the intrusion. 
I just need to get some information about our father and then I'll leave. 
Well, that was pleasant, wasn't it? 
Come on, let's go to my office. 
Have a seat. 
I'm fine. 
Okay, so what are we doing here, Jack? 
Our father used to do business with an ex-Russian general. 
His name was Gredenko. Do you know him? 
No. He must be one of the old guard. 
You can't believe some of the drinking buddies Dad's cultivated over the years. 
Oh, there was this one time, we were down in Venezuela, this was before Chavez... 
Gray! 
I didn't come here to listen to your stories. 
I'm serious. I need to find Dad. 
Okay, we will. 
Boy, Jack, you could never just walk in a room and get along, could you? 
I mean, I know, you know, you must have gone through hell in China and everything, but look on the bright side you got out. You're here. 
You should just relax a little bit. 
If you try and raise your voice, I will rip your tongue out, are we clear? 
Gray, people in this country are dying. 
I need some information. 
Are you going to give it to me, or do I have to start hurting you? 
Actually, you're hurting me now. 
Trust me... I'm not. 
The speech is in the teleprompter, sir. 
 With the most recent changes? 
 Yes, sir. 
Okay. 
Are you all right, sir? 
Tom, I can't let the American public see how scared I am. 
No, you cannot. 
But then we just got hit by a nuclear bomb. 
Bravado would be no more appropriate than fear. 
Thank you, Tom. 
My fellow Americans, there is no easy way to say the words: America has been hit by a nuclear weapon. 
But, as you know, this is now a fact. 
The question remains, what do we as a country, as a people, do about it? 
How do we rationalize the fear and sorrow that each one of us feels? 
Do we let our anger guide us down a dangerous path? 
Or do we come together, continuing to show courage and strength in the face of our enemy? 
Now, this horrible act of evil which has struck our great nation is the cowardly action of barbaric men. 
One more thing comes out of your mouth that I don't want to hear,  and this is gonna start to hurt. 
 I don't know where he is. What do you want? 
 The truth. 
 It's the truth. 
I swear to you on my family's life. 
Not good enough. 
You brought this on yourself. 
Transcript : 1000fr.com - sub-way.fr 
=THE LAST FANTASY= Proudly Presents =TLF SUB TEAM= EngSub by snowmoon How soon can you deploy once we arrive? 
It'll take us two hours to assemble the delivery system, and another hour to install the bomb. 
FAYED: That's longer than I'd hoped. 
Just remember, without us, you'd be delivering your payload in weeks instead of hours. 
If we succeed today, the Arabs and the West will destroy each other. 
Were you able to pick up anything on Gredenko? 
BUCHANAN: No. 
The Glasgow Street house was deserted. 
I think I might have a lead. 
BUCHANAN: What is it? 
BAUER: Charles Logan. 
Logan? 
BUCHANAN: He's at his retreat. 
He's under house arrest. 
So you need Gredenko to find Fayed. 
Can you help us? 
I never dealt with Gredenko directly, but I know how we can find him. 
How? 
Through Anatoly Markov. 
He's the Russian Consul General, here in Los Angeles. 
I don't trust you. 
If you want to find Gredenko, maybe it's time you started. 
You're taking a great risk, Mr. President. 
You and I are both sharing that risk, sir. 
We have three more nuclear weapons loose in my country. 
I want a public statement of support from your Prime Minister. 
And I want it to follow right on the heels of Assad's. 
A public endorsement of him could have grave political consequences for the Prime Minister. 
Now, you tell your Prime Minister that we have a carrier group operating less than 25 miles off his shores. 
It's armed. 
President's gonna die. 
There's nothing you can do about it. 
LENNOX: You've got to put a stop to this, Reed. 
Sir, there must have a moment when you were on board with this plan. 
Did you change your mind along the way? 
I need to know. 
I was against you from the start. 
You're just as bad as Fayed. 
MAN: All right, here we go for a run-through, everyone. 
What is this? 
Bomb! 
LOWRY: Citadel has been hit. 
Send a medical team. 
I repeat, Citadel is down! 
Send a medical team now! 
I've got it. 
Thank you. 
Let me be clear about this before we go anywhere. 
You are a federal prisoner under my custody. 
You do not make a move unless I tell you to, you understand me? 
You don't have to threaten me, Jack. 
I know what my role is. 
I just want to be of service. 
As far as I'm concerned, you'll never do anything that'll erase what you've already done. 
I understand your anger, I do. 
But if you want to find Gredenko, we should leave now. 
Get in the car. 
(engine starts) I haven't been outside these gates in over a year. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
You don't need me to tell you what it's like to be locked up. 
You're right, I don't. 
But I know how it feels to be locked away from the rest of the world. 
Lonely. 
A silence. 
Plays with your sanity. 
But in that silence, you can hear the voice of your deepest self. 
And if you listen to that voice, you have a chance to heal. 
(cell phone ringing) This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
Are you on your way to the Consulate? 
Yes. 
Before you get the, you need to know something. 
There was an assassination attempt on President Palmer. 
He was wounded, but we don't know the extent of his injuries yet. 
Oh, my God. 
How did this happen? 
Details are still coming in. 
Secret Service thinks it was Assad. 
What? 
They think he smuggled some kind of explosive device into the White House bunker. 
Bill, that doesn't make sense. 
Assad was working with the President to stop Fayed. 
That's what he said he was doing. 
He wasn't lying. 
He's dead, Jack. 
Doesn't matter if it was him or not. 
He can't help us stop Fayed. 
Which means you're following our only live lead. 
I understand. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I'm at the Consulate. 
All right. 
What happened? 
There was an assassination attempt on Wayne Palmer. 
(steady beeping) Excuse me, Mr. Pollock. 
(clears throat): Yes. What do you want? 
The Vice President is being tele-briefed in the conference room. 
The SecDef wants Mr. Lennox there. 
Well, Mr. Lennox is occupied. 
I'm covering for him. 
KANIN: Dr. Welton is monitoring 
the medical team, so I've asked him to brief us directly on the President's condition. 
Mr. Vice President. 
Go ahead. 
We're still trying to stabilize President Palmer. 
He was hit by shrapnel, which entered his upper chest and neck. 
He didn't suffer any direct head wounds, but he is unconscious. 
Can you determine when he might be able to resume his presidential duties? 
Sir, the President was within ten feet of a high-velocity explosive device. 
That he survived at all is... 
a miracle. 
KANIN: Mr. Vice President, 
as Secretary of Defense, I'm the ranking member of this committee. 
And I think I can speak for all of us when I say we have no way of knowing when or if the President will recover enough to function. 
We need to proceed under the assumption that the President's duties are now yours. 
I'm going to be landing in a few minutes. 
As soon as I get there, I want a full security briefing from Tom Lennox. 
Yes, sir. 
We'll see you here soon. 
Please submit your task profiles to my office. 
We'll reconvene when the Vice President gets here. 
Reed. 
Where the hell is Tom Lennox? 
I believe that he's conferencing with the Attorney General. 
I just spoke with the A.G. 
He's had no contact with him. 
Hmm. 
Well, then I'm not sure. 
You work for the man, you don't know where he is? 
President Palmer, uh, was expecting him in the broadcast studio, and he didn't show up. 
Tom Lennox is missing. 
Have your team sweep the bunker. 
Find him. 
Yes, sir. 
Need a ten-twenty on Tom Lennox. 
This is a priority request from the SecDef. 
You had the clarity to understand how to keep this country safe. 
But the President was an obstacle. 
We did what was necessary. 
Is he dead? 
No. 
But he's injured badly enough that he won't be able to serve. 
Secret Service is looking for Lennox. 
They're sweeping the bunker. 
Let me handle him while there's still time. 
No. 
Look, I told you before, I can make it look like a suicide. 
The situation will support it. 
He was depressed after the President rejected his plan. 
No. We cannot kill Tom Lennox. 
Why not? 
Because we're not murderers. 
What we did was necessary for the sake of national security. 
Killing Lennox is just about us trying to cover our involvement. 
Getting caught never part of the plan. 
Don't touch him. 
Or what? 
Or you'll have to kill me, too. 
Listen, I know Tom Lennox. 
He can be reasoned with. 
So you really did it. 
Only because it had to be done. 
You were the one who warned us all that the logic of this current engagement would demand extreme action. 
You said that for the greater good, individuals would need to be sacrificed. 
I wasn't referring to the President of the United States. 
Sir, the President's policies would have aided the enemy. 
They may have been well-intentioned, but they were na�ve, and they were dangerous, and you know that. 
Vice President Daniels is running this country now. 
He will implement your security plan. 
But if you implicate us, it will only drag you into this. 
And it will make your security plan that much harder to push through. 
I'm the one who tried to stop you, Reed. 
They'll never believe you. 
Sir, the only way to stop these nuclear weapons from being detonated on U.S. soil 
is through the proposals in your security plan. 
And all I have to do is do nothing. 
Yes. 
Carson has matched the bomb signature to a design used by Assad's organization. 
The FBI will put this all on Assad. 
No one needs to know the truth. 
I'll know. 
Sir, a guilty conscience is a fair price to pay for the survival of this country. 
(whispers): They're coming. 
Do you understand the situation, sir? 
I do understand, Reed. 
I know that you will do the right thing. 
Good. 
I'm gonna cut him loose. 
(grunts) Mr.Lennox, 
are you all right? 
Yes, Agent Lowry. 
Sir, the secretary of defense has been looking for you. 
Agent Lowry, these men are responsible for the attempted assassination of the president. 
I'm surrendering myself into custody till I can talk to the attorney general, WOMAN: Welcome back, sir. 
Thank you, Lisa. 
I've sifted through the latest flashes. 
These are the ones you need to take a look at. 
I went over everything on the plane. 
I want to follow up on the one from CTU. 
I'll get them on the line. 
I have the Vice President calling for Mr. Buchanan. 
(two beeps) MAN: Mr. Buchanan, 
I have the Vice President for you on line two. 
This is Bill Buchanan. 
LISA: Sir, one moment for the Vice President. 
Bill, I see from the White House flashes that President Palmer granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough. 
I'm curious as to what circumstances could possibly have led to that? 
Logan claims he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko, the man who supplied the terrorists with the suitcase nukes, sir. 
How? 
Through the Russian Consul in Los Angeles. 
Logan believes this man will know how to find Gredenko, but he insisted on approaching the consul in person. 
I'm frankly surprised President Palmer trusted Charles Logan to conduct any business on the government's behalf. 
I believe the president's decision was informed by the fact that we have no other active leads on Gredenko. 
Is Logan being supervised? 
Yes, by one of our agents, Jack Bauer. 
Bauer's been instructed to keep Logan on a short leash. 
You keep me posted to any progress. 
And as soon as this plays out, I want him back under house arrest. 
Yes, sir. 
You can come with me into the consulate, but I need to speak to Markov alone. 
You don't leave my sight. 
Then this is a waste of time. 
Markov won't tell us what we need to know if you're in the room. 
I don't let you out of my sight. 
What do you think I'm gonna do in there, Jack, request asylum? 
If it's any comfort, I don't think the Russians would take me. 
Fine. 
You can talk to the consul on your own, but I will be right outside the door. 
You try and move more than 20 feet away from me, and I will know. 
I'm gonna prove you wrong, Jack. 
I'm only trying to help. 
The Consul is expecting you, Mr. President. 
Follow me, please. 
(knocking) Mr. President. 
Anatoly. 
It's good to see you. 
It's a pleasure, sir. 
How have you been? 
Very well. 
Still trying to do my best for my country. 
As much as circumstances will allow, of course. 
Of course. 
My sincere sympathies to your people for the tragedy this morning. 
You have, uh, condolences and support of my country. 
Thank you. 
Now... 
how can I help you? 
The bomb that exploded this morning was a Russian suitcase nuclear device supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko. 
(heavy sigh) No, thank you. 
I don't smoke anymore. 
(clipping with scissors) (sighs) Mr. President, 
those weapons were destroyed as part of our treaty. 
We're certain of our facts, Anatoly, but I didn't come here to make accusations. 
I came here because we need to know where Gredenko is. 
(inhales deeply) I will ask Moscow to try to locate him immediately. 
I'm not asking Moscow, I'm asking you. 
I know that you two close are close, and you have been ever since you fought together in Afghanistan, so... 
I ask again. 
Where is he? 
I don't know. 
Dmitri and I were close for many years, but not now. 
Forgive my lack of diplomacy, but I don't believe you, and I'm willing to force the issue. 
Moscow has always suspected that someone inside the Russian government helped supply the Sentox nerve gas to the separatists two years ago. 
I have the tapes, Anatoly, of every phone call you made to my people. 
I will send them to President Suvarov. 
You gave me your word that my role would remain secret. 
My promise is rendered null and void by the fact that the terrorists that Gredenko was helping have three more bombs. 
I haven't spoken to Gredenko for more than one year. 
I will send the tapes, you'll be recalled to Moscow, and you will never be heard of again. 
You can send all the tapes you like... 
...destroy me many times over. 
I do not know where Gredenko is! 
All right, Anatoly. 
I believe you. 
Please forgive my tactics. 
I'm trying to save people's lives. 
So... if you know anyone else 
who might still be in contact with Gredenko... 
I will make calls. 
But as far as I know, everyone else has cut off contact with Dmitri, as well. 
Any support will be greatly appreciated. 
Of course. 
Anatoly. 
Mr. President. 
(sighs) He says he hasn't spoken to Gredenko in a year. 
He's lying. 
They're still in contact, and he knows enough about what's going on to want to deny that. 
How do you know? 
Because I've done enough lying myself to be familiar with the signs. 
(phone ringing) Yes? 
MARKOV: United States has connected you with terrorists. 
Are you sure? 
They sent Charles Logan to try and cause me to give up your location. 
The reason we brought the Arabs into this was to conceal our involvement. 
Now we're exposed. 
Russia is exposed. 
The Americans are speculating. 
They have no evidence. 
If they did, they wouldn't have sent Logan. 
(sighs): I don't know. 
Don't worry, Dmitri. 
By the time they find anything, it will be too late. 
All right. 
Let me know if you hear anything more. 
Drive through the front gates. 
Pull over as soon as you're out of sight of the guards. 
What are you going to do? 
(phone ringing) O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I need you to gain access to the DWP server. 
I want you to disable the power going to the Russian Consulate as soon as you can. Chloe, 
you need to do this under the radar. 
How long do you need the power out for? 
60 seconds. Make it look 
like a grid failure in case the consulate tries to contact the DWP. 
I'll get back to you when I'm ready. 
Are you going back in there? 
Jack, you just spent nearly two years in a Chinese prison because you violated the sovereignty of their consulate. 
Now you plan to go back into the Russian consulate and take a chance on that happening again?! 
REPORTER: As nightfall approaches in the Pacific time zone, Hazmat teams and emergency crews in Valencia, California, continue to search for survivors, while the official death toll stands at just over 12,000. 
(phone rings) And the number is rising... 
Hi. 
Where are you? 
I'm still at the airport. 
Waiting for my plane. Why? 
What's up? 
About a half hour ago there was an attempt made on President Palmer's life. 
What? 
They won't know the full extent of his injuries until he regains consciousness. 
There's been nothing of this on the news. 
Hasn't been made public yet. 
The Vice President's on his way back to the White House. 
He's already assumed executive duties. 
I have to go back. 
You think Daniels will have you back? 
You've already tendered your resignation. 
Nothing's been processed. 
Technically, I can withdraw my resignation. 
I've gotta go back, Bill. 
Look, I'll call you when I get there, okay? 
All right. 
Once we're settled in, I want to go over an annotated copy of the Lennox proposal. 
I'll need you to work up a distribution list. 
The President rejected that plan. 
What's your point? 
Don't you think it might be a little too soon to enact it? 
(sighs) Lisa, a Muslim terrorist just set off a bomb inside the White House. 
If anything, we've delayed this far too long. 
Mr. Vice President. 
Hello, Ethan. 
What's the President's condition? 
Well, they've managed to stabilize him. 
But it's still too soon to make a prognosis. 
Something else has come up. 
There's been a development in the investigation of the assassination attempt. 
Tom Lennox has remanded himself into custody. 
Lennox? 
What are you talking about? 
Oh, just about two hours ago. 
That's when Reed first hinted that there was a plot against the President. 
But you waited an hour before you tried to report it. 
Because there was nothing actionable that... 
just all innuendo. 
I was simply trying to wait and find out more. 
By the time I realized they were making their move, Reed caught me trying to alert Agent Hollister. 
That's when he struck you over the head and tied you up. 
That's correct. 
So when you provided Bruce Carson's clearance into the White House... 
Wait, no, no. 
No, I didn't provide anybody clearance. 
Reed stole my clearance card. 
And gave these men the President's classified itinerary, you were just pretending. 
Yes. 
Or maybe it's just that you had second thoughts? 
(sighs) (door opens) I would like to speak to Mr. Lennox alone, please. 
Yes, sir. 
I tried to stop this, Noah. 
I'd like to believe you, Tom. 
But I'll leave it to the Justice Department to determine your role in this. 
As well as Assad's. 
Assad? 
They were setting him up. 
He had nothing to do with this. 
You don't know that. 
It's my understanding, you suggested that others besides Reed and this man Carson may have been involved. 
Only because Reed implied as much. 
I was just trying to ferret out who else might be involved. 
And did you? 
No. 
Then it is conceivable that Assad may have been, at the very least, a willing participant in this attack. 
That makes no sense whatsoever. 
Assad was a terrorist who hated this country and everything it stands for. 
What better way for him to rally his people than to martyr himself by murdering the President of the United States. 
Don't you understand that is exactly what Reed and Carson wanted this to look like and now you're playing right into it. 
I am going to address the nation shortly, to inform the public about what's happened. 
Until I have all the facts, I am not about to tell them that Hamri Al-Assad is innocent in this. 
I see what you're doing here, Noah. 
By scapegoating Assad, you'll be able to reverse the President's agenda. 
Get even more aggressive with the Islamic community. 
You think I don't see what you're doing here? 
It's your plan, Tom. 
You outlined those measures yourself. 
I was your staunchest advocate. 
What has happened to the President is horrific. 
But if there is any good to come from this, it's that we now have the opportunity to do what we both know is in the best interests of protecting this country. 
You're asking a whole heck of a lot more than for me just to maintain silence on Assad. 
The Cabinet knows that you are the architect of the plan. 
If you're not on the face of it now, it may raise questions. 
Or have you come to believe the President was correct in rejecting your proposals? 
No. 
I-I know it's, it's the only way to stop these attacks. 
Then you can stick to your assertion of Assad's complete innocence. 
Or I can clear you of these charges and you can help me to initiate your plan, which we both know is in the best interest of the country. 
Agent Lowry. 
I don't want Mr. Lennox's 
statement promoted to the Attorney General until it's gone through my office. 
Yes, sir. 
* * (speaking Russian) (buzzing) Have you got it? 
Yeah, I've logged onto the DWP Server. 
You have a 60 second window before the building's circuits kick back in. 
Hold on. 
Shut it down now. 
(beeping) What is happening? 
I don't know. 
Something's wrong. 
You check the upper level, I check the lower level. 
Got it. 
(speaking Russian) What is this? 
Put your hands where I can see them. 
I don't know what he's doing, sending you here. 
Where's Gredenko? 
I told him I don't know. 
We know you're lying. 
Get you hands away from the desk now! 
Sit down! 
You're breaking international law. 
Violating sovereignty of the Consulate. 
I don't have time to ask nicely. 
Where's Gredenko? 
I-I don't know, I swear. 
(speaking Russian) I'm not sure what's happening. 
When the power came back on, the Consul's panic button was triggered. 
(knocking on door) Consul Markov? 
Are you all right? 
I've taken the Consul hostage at gunpoint. 
If you make any attempt to enter this room, I will kill him. 
Do you understand me? 
Find out who this man is and alert Moscow. 
(speaking Russian) This is Jack, let me speak to Buchanan. 
MAN: Jack Bauer on line one. 
What's going on, Jack? 
Bill, I got a situation. 
Logan's play didn't work. 
So I came back to the Consulate to talk to Markov myself. 
Before I could get any information from him, I was discovered. 
I've barricaded myself in his office, but I don't know how much more time I've got. 
It's Russian territory I can't sanction what you're doing. 
I know, Bill. 
I'm calling because you need to call the White House and advise them. 
I want you to stand down, find a way out. 
I'm not going anywhere until Markov tells me how to find Gredenko. 
Mr. Vice President. 
The Press Secretary is set up for your televised address. 
You'll be going live in approximately ten minutes. 
(clearing throat): Thank you, Lisa. 
Have you finished drafting my statement? 
I'll have it for you momentarily. 
I thought you should know I just received word Karen Hayes has withdrawn her resignation. 
She's on her way here now. 
Do we know what prompted her resignation in the first place? 
Officially, it was to return to Los Angeles to be with her husband, but rumor has it she stepped down because of her opposition to the Lennox Plan. 
I see. 
CTU OPERATOR: Mr. Vice President, 
I have Bill Buchanan on the line. 
This is the Vice President. 
Sir, a situation has developed at the Russian Consulate. 
What kind of situation? 
Jack Bauer has taken Russian Consul Markov hostage. 
He's holding him at gunpoint inside the Consulate. 
What? 
How could that happen? 
Markov denied having any contact with Gredenko, but Logan insisted he was lying. 
When the escort left the Consulate, Bauer went back to question Markov. 
That's when he was discovered. 
My God. 
Did you approve these actions? 
No, sir. 
Bauer acted on his own authority. 
And the questionable assumption of Charles Logan. 
Sir, Bauer has absolutely no reason to trust Charles Logan. 
(phone ringing) Yet he was convinced enough to take the action that he did. 
In any event, he's created a diplomatic mess. 
If Markov has information that could lead us to Gredenko... 
Yes. 
...then extracting 
it is our only chance to stop the next nuke from being detonated. 
Excuse me, sir. 
Not now, Lisa. 
Sir, it's President Suvarov. 
(sighs) (clears throat) Bill, I don't know how long I can hold off the Russians. 
If Markov is connected to these nukes, Bauer had better get it out of him fast. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) Mr. President, 
this is Vice President Daniels. 
I was expecting to speak to President Palmer. 
My apologies. 
I'm afraid he's unavailable. 
Unavailable? 
Sir, I'm speaking on his authority. 
I assume that you're calling about the incident at your Consulate. 
Let me assure you this man is acting on his own and not under the orders or authority of the United States government. 
Nevertheless, this is a gross violation of our sovereignty. 
If your agent does not stand down immediately, my country will have no choice but to retaliate with the most forceful diplomatic measures at our disposal. 
I understand your position, Mr. President, 
but before you escalate this, you should understand mine. 
We have learned that Consul Markov is most likely in contact with Dmitri Gredenko, who we've linked to the nuclear attack that took place on U.S. soil this morning. 
If that's true, we will look upon him as a coconspirator in the attack. 
Mr. Vice President, 
I deeply regret the tragedy that your country has experienced today, but you must make these charges through proper diplomatic channels after your agent has surrendered. 
(grunts) I want to know where Gredenko is and what he's doing. 
(whispering): I don't know. 
I haven't spoken to Gredenko since he arrived in the United States. 
I never said he was in the United States. 
Why don't I tell you what we know? 
We already know that Gredenko supplied Fayed with the five suitcase nukes. 
What doesn't make sense is why he's still involved unless, of course, he's doing something else for Fayed. 
That's what we want to know. 
What is Gredenko doing for Fayed?! 
(whispering): I don't know. 
You're gonna tell me what I want to know or you're gonna start losing your fingers one by one. 
This is your last chance. 
No! 
(screams) I've got the feed. 
Don't move in yet. 
He's too close to Markov. 
You have one of two choices. 
You can either give me the information that I want and I'll go pick up Gredenko, or I can kill you. 
And I'll make sure Gredenko finds out. 
And he'll panic because he'll think you gave him up before you died. 
He'll be forced to use his exit route. 
Either way he stops what he's doing in this country now! 
The choice is yours. 
How do I find Gredenko?! 
(breathing heavily) M-Mojave Desert. 
Shadow Valley. 
Where in the Shadow Valley? 
I don't know. 
What is he doing? 
What is he doing?! 
Launching drones. 
What? 
Aerial drones for Fayed. 
His delivery system for nuclear bombs. 
How soon will the drones be ready? 
Two hours. 
In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air. 
You son of a bitch. 
(screams) (breathing heavily) (laughs) Now! 
(yells) Don't let anyone near this man. 
Do you understand? 
My fellow Americans... 
I regret to inform you that, a short time ago, President Palmer was seriously injured in an assassination attempt at the White House. 
Thankfully, he is alive and currently in stable condition. 
The prime suspect, Hamri Al-Assad, was killed in the explosion. 
And in light of this heinous and cowardly act, compounded by the tragedy in California, I will be pushing forward an aggressive agenda of national security, one that will, out of necessity, suspend certain civil liberties. 
This is the price of war. 
Make no mistake. 
That is exactly what this is. 
Have you been able to reach Jack? 
No, but my system logs confirm he did try to call in. 
Are we monitoring communications in and out of the Russian Consulate? 
We are, but diplomatic traffic is encrypted with an advanced algorithm that we've never been able to crack, but... 
I think I have a way around that. 
One of the computers in the Consulate isn't properly shielded, so I'm picking up a digital shadow of their messages before they're encrypted. 
Look. 
What's that? 
ASCII code. 
It is? 
Yeah, in Russian. 
I just have to load a Cyrillic grid and I should be good to go. 
(speaking Russian) Oh, no. 
They're saying they've got an American agent in custody. 
Forceful and decisive action needs to be taken. 
(phone rings) And I promise you... 
Buchanan. 
Sir, Morris just intercepted some bandwidth from the Russian Consulate. 
Apparently, they got to Jack. 
What do you mean "got to him"? 
They moved in on his position and recovered Markov. 
Sir, they're holding Jack prisoner. 
Sir, we probably should inform the Vice President. 
No, no, not yet. 
He's in a diplomatic standoff with Suvarov. 
He won't get anywhere with a direct appeal. 
So what's our next move? 
Have Special Ops draw up a plan to get into the Consulate. 
I want to give the Vice President the option to take the Consul by force... 
...and hopefully rescue Jack. 
(Jack wheezing, men speaking Russian) (coughing) (speaking Russian) Enough. 
Please, you have to listen to me. 
I am not allowed to talk to you. 
That's because your Consul doesn't want you to hear what I know. 
Dmitri Gredenko is responsible for supplying the terrorists with the nuclear bomb that was detonated earlier today. 
Markov is working with him against the orders of your government. 
(coughs) You will get the chance to make these allegations through the appropriate channels. 
No, there's not enough time. 
Gredenko has three more bombs. 
They're going to find their targets by way of an unmanned drone aircraft. 
With the Consul's knowledge? 
That is a ridiculous accusation. 
He is the one who told me; he confessed. 
Under duress! 
He gave me Gredenko's location. 
He told me the aircraft would be ready to launch within two hours. 
I know you believe me! 
You know about Markov's connection to Gredenko. 
Please. 
You have to help. 
Even if you are telling me the truth, there is nothing I can do. 
The Consul approves all communications to Moscow. 
I don't want you to call Moscow. 
I want you to call CTU. 
I want you to give them Gredenko's location and advise them of the time frame. 
Where is he? 
Somewhere in the high desert. 
The Shadow Valley. 
You need to call 310-597-3781. 
You need to tell them you have a message for Bill Buchanan from me. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
(breathing heavily) Please... please. 
I hope you are telling me the truth. 
For your sake as well as mine. 
You know I am. 
Otherwise, you wouldn't even consider doing this. 
You need to hurry. 
OPERATOR: CTU. 
I need to speak to Bill Buchanan. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan's in a meeting. 
It's urgent! 
Mr. Buchanan, 
there's a man on the line from the Russian Consulate. 
He says it's urgent. 
This is Bill Buchanan. 
Hello? 
=TLF SUB TEAM= http://tlfsub.eastgame.net 
I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response. 
SUVAROV:  Until you have the component, I have no choice but to continue on our present path. 
The man who has the component is no longer working with the Chinese. 
He's offered to trade it back to us, and I've authorized the exchange. 
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath. 
 We can't trust that  he'll give us that component re probably on their way' to arrest me. 
They're here. 
Send the kid down now. 
Show the sub-circuit board first. 
 I need to verify it. 
There they are. 
They've got Josh. 
 I don't have a clear shot  without putting Josh at risk. 
Get down! 
I want you to get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten-mile radius. 
My father didn't pick this location at random. 
Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases through the CNC server. 
You okay? 
Yeah. I'm fine. 
My God! Chloe! Chloe? 
Could someone please help me? 
Darling? Darling? 
Can you hear me? 
Can someone please help me?! 
(motor humming) (motor stops) Joshua. 
I don't want to be here with you! 
We're not staying here. 
We're leaving. 
I don't want to go anywhere with you. 
Look, Josh, I don't expect you to understand everything. 
Not now, anyway. 
Someday, you will, and you'll thank me for it. 
In the meantime, you'll do as you're told. 
Is that clear? 
Good. 
(Cheng speaking Chinese) The submarine is on schedule. 
How soon before they pick us up? 
30 minutes. 
Her vitals are strong. 
She's in no immediate danger. 
Then why did she collapse? 
Dehydration. Exhaustion. 
She hasn't slept in 36 hours. 
He said I'm fine, Morris. 
It's not a big deal. 
You should be at your workstation. 
No. I should 
be right here with you. 
You should be checking the EPA database, to see what oil platforms are owned by Phillip Bauer. 
Other people can do that. 
If you really want to make me feel better, then go find Phillip Bauer. 
Are you sure you're all right? 
Okay, then. 
(sighs) Morris, is Chloe all right? 
The doctor's still running some tests, but he says she's going to be fine. 
Jack was right about his father. 
One of his companies owns a federal lease on an oil platform six miles offshore. 
That's where you think Phillip Bauer's keeping the boy? 
Well, the platform's been decommissioned. 
Okay. Give me 
the wheel, Nadia. 
Let's try a thermal scan. 
See if we can pick up any signs of life. 
That's awfully crowded for a decommissioned platform. 
Can you back-time the satellite imagery a few minutes? 
Okay, there. That must be 
Josh Bauer arriving. 
That would be 20 minutes after he was taken. 
The timing works. 
Send a copy of this to my screen, and forward it to the White House. 
Will do. 
Get me Tom Lennox, please. 
(phone rings) Dr. Hastings here. 
This is Morris O'Brian. 
Have Chloe O'Brian's test results come in yet? 
You just left here a few minutes ago, Mr. O'Brian. 
We're still running those tests. 
Well, when do you expect the results? 
Soon. 
Can you call me when you get them? 
I'm afraid I can't release that information. 
Not without Ms. O'Brian's permission. 
I'm her husband. 
Ex-husband. I'm sorry, 
but I can only share information with Ms. O'Brian's family. 
Fine. 
And reports indicate the Russians are setting up an offensive position. 
All right. Thank you. 
Meaning they can attack our base at a moment's notice. 
That's correct, sir. 
Sir, that was CTU. 
They've just located Phillip Bauer and a dozen or so confederates on an oil drilling platform six miles off the coast of Los Angeles. 
And he has the sub-circuit board? 
We are assuming so, sir. 
I'll pass this on to Suvarov. 
Maybe it'll buy us some more time. 
Meanwhile, I want an assault team dispatched to that oil rig. 
Mr. Vice President, 
if I may? 
Go ahead, Ethan. 
If the platform is well-defended, an assault team might run into trouble. 
I recommend an air attack. 
Two Navy F-18's could obliterate that platform and everyone on it. 
What about the sub-circuit board? 
If it's not destroyed in the attack, it'll sink into the ocean, the salt water will render it useless in minutes. 
Tom? 
Sir, we think Phillip Bauer's grandson is on that same platform. 
Now, he might well survive a surgical strike by an assault team, but there's no way he's going to live through this proposed aerial attack. 
We are talking about an innocent 16-year-old boy here. 
None of us like this any more than you do, but if the Russians attack our base, a lot of innocent young men are going to die. 
And the truth is, an air strike would be the most effective from a political point of view, as well. 
It'll show the Russians that we're sparing no effort to destroy the sub-circuit board. 
Send the F-18's immediately. 
Yes, sir, Mr. Vice President. 
You're gonna be all right, Mike. 
You're going to make it. 
Jack, I'm sorry. 
You were following your orders. 
(phone rings) Get the kid... 
Get the kid,  Jack. 
I will. 
Did you find my father? 
Yes. We believe 
that he's on a decommissioned Tomol oil platform, six miles offshore. 
Were you able to confirm that Josh is with him? 
Thermal scan shows three people arriving on the platform 20 minutes after Josh was taken, so it's highly likely he's one of them. 
Nadia, I want to lead the assault team. 
There's not going to be an assault team, Jack. 
What are you talking about? 
I just got notification that the White House has ordered an air strike by Navy F-18s. 
The Vice President thinks an assault team will take too long. 
I couldn't call those jets back if I tried. 
When is it going to happen? 
In less than 30 minutes. 
Look, I need you and Bill to come back to CTU on Aerial One for an immediate debrief. 
Jack? 
Fine. 
What's wrong? 
CTU located my father and Josh on one of the offshore oil platforms. 
There's not going to be an assault. 
They've launched an F-18 air strike. 
No one on that platform is going to survive. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
Jack, don't even think about it. 
You'll only get yourself killed. 
You won't save Josh. 
Look, I realize he's your nephew... 
I'm not going to do something because he's my nephew. 
I'm going to do something because he's an innocent kid being written off as some kind of an acceptable loss. It's wrong. 
Nadia has ordered us back to CTU in Chopper One. 
I'm going to take it. 
I'll fly. 
You prep the weapons. 
It's been a while, but I can get us to the platform. 
With any luck, I might even be able to get us back. 
You don't need to do this, Bill. 
Yes, I do. 
I don't want to live with this one either. 
Let's get ready. 
You're going to need that. 
We're commandeering your helicopter. Get out. 
#Fixing target coordinates. 
Be in range in 22 minutes. 
Sir, significant numbers of Russian troops have assumed a flanking position along the eastern rim of our military base. 
What am I to take from that? 
A tactical advancement like that indicates imminent attack. 
All right. 
Put him through. Sir? 
You got Suvarov? 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. President, this is 
Vice President Daniels. 
Mr. Vice President, 
the last time we spoke, you said an opportunity had presented itself. 
Unfortunately, that didn't work out, but there has been a significant new development, and I'm asking you to hold off on any military assault on our base. 
For what reason, sir? 
The Chinese agents who are in possession of the component have been tracked to an oil platform off our West Coast. 
We assume they're there awaiting transport to China. 
I've ordered an air strike to destroy the platform before that rendezvous can happen. 
I realize that... 
you have no reason to accept what I'm telling you. 
Not without proof, at least, but I implore you... 
Mr. Vice President, 
I believe you. 
Just moments ago, one of our listening posts intercepted a transmission to a Chinese submarine operating in the western Pacific. 
The point of origin is ten miles off your coast. 
And the contents suggest that the submarine is en route to pick up the component. 
Then you know that I'm telling you the truth. 
You say you have already launched an air strike against this oil platform. 
Yes. That's the only way we can 
make absolutely certain that the component's been destroyed. 
Sir, we're prepared to give you a real-time uplink to our satellite feed of the assault operation. 
One moment, please, sir. 
(indistinct murmuring) Uh, how long until your fighters reach the target? 
Less than 20 minutes, sir. 
20 minutes, Mr. President. 
Very well, but be advised, nothing less than the complete destruction of this oil platform will give us the assurance we require. 
Understood. 
Stand by. 
The satellite feed will be there momentarily. 
I wish you luck, Mr. Vice President. 
Yes, the Coast Guard and the Navy are coordinating directly. 
They're patrolling a five-mile perimeter around the target. 
Yes, sir. I'll keep 
you in the loop. 
What is it, Morris? 
Jack's commandeered a CTU chopper. 
He's requesting an uplink to our satellite feed. 
What? 
He's on the way to the oil platform. He's 
with Bill Buchanan. 
NADIA: Arial One, please confirm. 
Come in. 
This is Bauer. We copy. 
Look, Jack, I know you want to save your nephew, but I can't authorize a suicide mission. 
We don't need your authorization, Nadia, we need your help. 
Those F-18s will be within striking range in 18 minutes. 
What if we find the component first? 
It won't make a difference. 
The strike team's orders are non-contingent. 
All you're gonna do is get yourselves killed. 
BUCHANAN: Nadia, it's Bill. Look, 
I understand the pressure you're under, but you have to believe me when I tell you this is the right call to make. 
Morris said you need a visual on the oil platform? 
Yes. 
We need to know how many hostiles are on the platform and where they are. 
MORRIS: Uploading the latest satellite capture. 
Okay, you'll have it in a few seconds. 
Copy that. Send it to my PDA. 
PDA? Got it. 
BUCHANAN: Thank you, Nadia. 
You did the right thing. 
Bill, I need you to put your comm unit in. 
How should I make our approach, Jack? 
Wind's heavy out of the west. 
If we fly into it and stay low to the water, we should be able to catch them off-guard. 
It won't buy us much time. 
We'll have to engage them from the air. 
I'll hold them off so you can land, then we'll move in. 
The radar is locked onto the target. 
Josh. 
We'll leave in 15 minutes. 
Please just let me go. 
I can't do that. 
Why not? 
Because I can't. 
You have a lot to learn. 
Now, it's my responsibility to teach you. The 
first lesson is... 
pay attention. 
(speaking Chinese) What is it? 
There's a helicopter approaching. 
We need to get to the boat and head west. 
There's a locator beacon onboard. 
The submarine will pick us up. 
Here. Take the component. 
I'll see about the helicopter. 
I'll join you shortly. 
Once we hit the deck, we're gonna have to move hard. 
You ready to move up? 
Ready! 
Take it up! 
We're clear to land! 
(yelling) Don't move! 
Where's the boy? 
Where is the boy?! 
You're too late. 
Take this. Get him 
up to the chopper What are you doing? 
I'm gonna make sure Josh isn't on this platform. 
We only have ten minutes! 
Get up! Get up! 
#Come on, Josh. Stop it. 
I can't. 
Of course you can. 
All it takes is a little self-control. 
You're behaving like a child. 
You have to learn to control your emotions. 
You must never let them control you, you understand? 
Good. 
Come on. 
(gunshots) Target will be in range in four minutes, 30 seconds. 
(groans) (panting) I'm not going with you. 
You're not gonna shoot me. 
Give me the gun. 
Now. 
No. 
As long as you're alive, me and my mom will never be safe. 
Josh, listen to me. 
I've always cared about you. 
No! 
You only care about yourself. 
That's not true. 
You're the reason I'm doing all this. 
Shut up! 
I love you, Josh. 
(gunshot) (groans) Josh! 
It's all right. 
I've got him. 
You can lower that weapon. 
Josh! 
Lower your gun. 
I know how scared and angry you must feel right now. 
I know. I've been exactly 
where you are. 
I know exactly how you feel, but you're gonna have to trust me on this. 
You do not want to live with the pain of taking another person's life, even if you think they deserve it. 
In a few minutes, there's gonna be an F-18 air strike on this platform. 
We need to get out of here. 
We need to get out of here now. 
Please. 
It's all right. 
Just give me the gun. 
It's all right. 
It's all right. 
It's over. It's over. 
I need you to get up to the top of the platform and get in the chopper now. 
Go. Move!  
What about you? 
I'll be right behind you! 
Keep going! 
Get up. 
Get up! 
It's over. 
Then finish it. 
No. 
You are gonna be held accountable for what you have done today. 
I don't think so. 
You don't have time to carry me, not if what you said about the air strike is true. 
And you don't want to die. 
Not here. 
Not with me. 
You're gonna get off easy. 
CTU, this is Aerial One. 
My count shows the strike in two minutes. 
Negative. You 
have 90 seconds before those F-18s are within striking range. 
You need to get off that platform now. 
Bill. Confirm. 
Copy that! Stand by! 
Where's Jack? 
He's with my grandpa. 
Get in! 
Mr. Vice President, the target 
is in range. Strike team 
reports... missile lock. 
Take it out. 
Echo six-four is clear to engage. 
Echo six-four, you are clear to engage. 
Roger that. 
Stand by for missile launch. 
Wait! We can't leave 
without my uncle! 
We're not leaving. Hang on. 
Jack, I'm coming around to the south. 
Meet me on level three. 
Copy that, Bill. I'm on it. 
Bill, I see you. 
I'm on the southwest corner. 
Fox One, fire. 
(grunts) Aerial One, please confirm. 
Bill, please confirm. 
Bill, this is Nadia. 
Do you copy? 
BUCHANAN: CTU, this is Aerial One. 
We copy. 
I've got Jack and his nephew, and Cheng in custody. 
We're heading back to CTU. 
We'll have a landing crew standing by, sir. 
Strike team reports multiple direct hits. 
Satellite recon is reporting... 
target is completely destroyed. 
Good work. 
Mr. President, you're seeing 
what we're seeing. 
Yes, we are. 
(indistinct murmuring) We concur that the target has been eliminated. 
Then I trust you're satisfied that the component's been destroyed, as well. 
I am. 
I'm ordering the full withdrawal of our troops from the eastern rim of your military base. 
Good, Mr. President. 
You will excuse me if I wait until your troops are completely withdrawn before I order our squadrons in the air to stand down. 
Yes, of course. 
And Mr. Vice President... 
I regret that the events of this day have brought us to such a dangerous and unfortunate situation, but... 
when my country's security is threatened... 
I understand, Mr. President, 
all too well. 
Yes, I'm sure you do. 
My best wishes for the recovery of President Palmer. 
Thank you. 
Good-bye, Mr. Vice President. 
What the hell happened? 
He fell! 
Uncle Jack fell! 
All right, I'm going back. 
He's all right. 
* * Where are we going? 
Back to CTU. 
No, we can't. 
We have to go back for him. 
Jack's not ready to go back yet. 
#You should know, sir, we've received confirmation the Chinese have recalled their sub to its base in Ningpo. 
Tell Admiral Smith to have one of our subs shadow them. 
I want the Chinese to know that we're aware of their activities. 
Yes, sir. 
And thank you, Ethan, for everything. 
Extend my gratitude to the Joint Chiefs. 
Congratulations, Mr. Vice President. 
Sir, not to quash your flush of victory here... 
the actions of the Chinese cannot go unaddressed. 
We'll leave that for another day, Tom. 
Right now, I don't know about you, but I could use some sleep. 
There's just one other outstanding issue I would like to discuss with you, sir. 
Karen Hayes. 
Sir, she's about to be transferred into FBI custody. 
Now in light of the recent terrorist attacks, the nuke in California, the plot against the President, I just think we need to preserve whatever... 
(sighs) ...fragile faith the American 
people might still have in this administration. 
Just let Karen and Bill resign with their reputations intact. 
All right, Tom. 
Take care of that for me. 
All right. 
Thank you, sir. 
Here's that tape recording you asked for. 
(sighs) Hey. 
Hi. 
How you feeling? 
Good. 
Jack got the boy. 
They're both safe. 
What about the Russians? 
They backed off. 
They were satisfied that the component was destroyed. 
And Jack's father? 
He was killed in the air strike. 
And Cheng's in custody. 
Good. 
Look... 
um... 
I was talking to Dr. Hastings. 
He says the test results are in, but he's not telling me anything. 
He insists I talk to you. 
Is it... serious? 
Yeah. 
Bloody hell, Chloe, whatever it is, I'll help you get through it. 
No, you won't. 
We're not together. 
Oh, sod that. 
Really, come on, when you collapsed, I thought something might really be wrong. 
I can't lose you, darling. 
Really? 
Yeah, really. 
I love you. 
Okay. 
That's good, 'cause I'm pregnant. 
You mean what? 
With child? 
That's usually how it works. 
(whispers): Chloe... 
You know... 
this is a nice moment. 
Let's not ruin it by saying something stupid. 
Let's just go back to work. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Tom? 
Karen. 
You've come to say good-bye? 
Well, in a manner of speaking. 
You're free to go. 
The Vice President is dropping all charges against you. 
What about Bill? 
He's being pardoned, as well. 
Of course, the Vice President's still expecting your resignations, but, uh... you're free to 
go live your lives without fear of prosecution. 
Is that suitable? 
Yes. Yes. 
Yes, it is. 
All right. 
Well, good luck. 
I know you had a hand in this, Tom. 
Thank you. 
You know, Karen, I actually think I'm going to miss you. 
Really? 
I can answer that better after you've gone. 
There's your mother. 
Josh! 
(sobbing) You'll be debriefed at a federal detention facility. 
My people will not abandon me like you abandoned Jack Bauer. 
Get him out of here. 
It's good to see you again, sir. 
You did good work today. 
You should be proud. 
Thank you. 
That means a lot coming from you. 
Where's Jack? 
He fell from the chopper into the ocean during the extraction. 
He made it to shore; he's fine. 
Why didn't you pick him up? 
He didn't want me to. 
I don't understand. 
We need to find him. 
We'll never find him. 
Not if he doesn't want us to. 
Let him go. 
Somehow it just doesn't feel real. 
But I am grateful that she's alive. 
Of course. 
I'll let you know. 
Thanks. 
(sighs) (door closing) Put it down. 
Now. 
Are you here to kill me? 
Depends. 
Where's Audrey? 
I told you before, you're not getting anywhere near my daughter... 
You do not tell me what to do anymore! 
Do you understand me? 
You do not tell me what to do. 
I just watched my father die... 
and I felt nothing. 
You know why? 
Yeah, you know why. 
Because that man was dead to me years ago. 
I admired you, I looked up to you like a father. 
You were the kind of man I wanted to be. 
And you took advantage of it! 
Jack, listen to me. 
No! You are going 
to listen to me. 
Earlier today, you said that I was cursed. 
That anyone I touched... 
ended up dead or ruined. 
How dare you. 
How... dare you. 
The only thing I did, the only thing I have ever done, is what you and people like you have asked of me. 
Why didn't you try to get me out of China? 
I did try. 
Not hard enough! 
You had the political power. 
Was the timing not right? 
Was it a little too complicated? 
Or was I just an acceptable loss? 
Jack, I understand your anger... 
Shut up! 
You don't understand a thing about me. 
But I know you. 
I know why you're angry at me. 
And it wasn't because Audrey went to China to save me. 
It was because when you told her not to, she did it anyway. 
You'll never understand that kind of commitment, that kind of loyalty. 
You're right, Jack. 
It wasn't fair of me to put all this on you, to blame you for what happened to Audrey. 
I know the sacrifices you've made. 
I know this country owes you more than it will ever repay. 
I'm not interested in what you think this country owes me. 
I want my life back, and I want it now. 
Audrey's all I've got. 
And you can't stop me. 
In case you've forgotten, I'm very good at disappearing. 
And if you try sending someone after us, I'm kill them. 
I'm pretty good at that, too. 
Simply getting your life back, Jack, isn't going to change who you are. 
And you can't walk away from it. 
You know that. 
You've tried it. 
Sooner or later you're going to get back in the game. 
And my daughter's going to pay the price, like your wife did. 
You son of a bitch. 
Jack, I beg you, just stop for a moment and think. 
Think, Jack. 
You won't be able to take care of her the way you want to. 
Where is she? 
Take me to her now. 
* * It's me. I'm here. 
I know that I promised... 
to take care of you... 
and protect you... 
But I'm at a crossroads. 
Right now, the best way... 
The only way... 
to do that is to let you go. 
I hope one day you can understand that. 
I hope one day  you can forgive me. 
I love you with all my heart. 
And I always will. 
America has been victimized again. 
Last night terrorist's attack in San Antonio was not the latest in the series of bombings that began eleven weeks ago in ten differents cities. 
Over nine hundred people have been killed this far and while no one is claiming responsability for this wave of death, evidence points to Islamic militance. 
Here in Los Angeles, the mood can only be described as tense and fearfull as the department of Homeland Security is urging all citizens to report without delay any suspicious persons or activities. 
We spoke with the department spokesperson who says, quote: "We don't want to start a witchhunt "but we would rather here* on the side of caution "than become the next target." 
"And he says "the vigilance of the public "is our best line of defense against attacks." 
Stop, stop, stop! 
Open the doors! 
Please, I have to get to work. 
I'll be late for work. 
Please, open the door! 
Come on, man. 
Open the door. 
Open the d... I... 
can't believe you... 
I can't believe you didn't open the door! 
I have as much right to be on the bus as you! 
Our country is under siege! 
You're the national security advisor, Karen! 
Frankly, I'm surprised by your resistance. 
These places that you keep building? 
They're nothing more than concentration camps. 
Detention facilities. 
And the criteria for determining who should be detained are very reasonable. 
Reasonable? 
This revised plan of yours justifies locking-up every American who prays towards Mecca. 
That's ridiculous exageration, you know it. 
Right now, the American Muslim community is our greatest asset. 
They have provided law enforcement with hundreds of tips, and none a single member of that community has been implicated in these attacks. 
So far! 
Mr. President, 
the people are loosing faith in our hability to protect them. 
We've got to do something about this, now. 
And locking-up more Muslims will not make them safer. 
No, Karen, but it will make them feel safer. 
What about the cost of the civil unrest that your plan will create? 
 They will be riots, demonstrations  Security has its price! 
So does freedom, Tom. 
Listen, I just don't see how I can sign off on something like this. 
I mean, it wasn't just three months ago that I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the constitution. 
And what about preserving, protecting and defending the American people? 
All of these measures are legal. 
Blake has been all over these thing with the attorney general. 
There is a precedent, sir. 
Especially in war time. 
Lincoln suspended the Habeus Corpus. 
Roosevelt sent executive... 
Yes Blake, I know this! 
And Roosevelt imprisonned over 200.000 Japanese-Americans, 
what most historians consider to be a shameful mistake. 
Well, I would ask those historians how many of those Japanese-Americans were thus prevented from perpretrating acts of sabotage in this country? 
I realize that what I'm proposing has its challenges but we cannot continue to keep our heads burried in the sand. 
 Mr President? 
 Yeah? 
Another attack? 
Los Angeles. A bus. 
How many casualties? 
Twenty three so far, including the suicide bomber. 
We're almost certain this man Assad is behind all these attacks, right? 
Yes, sir. We confirmed 
he arrived in the United-States three days before the first bombing in San Antonio. 
And let us not forget Assad has been calling for the destruction of the United-States for the last twenty years. 
Mr President, my analysts believe that Assad's organization cannot survive without him and once he's dead, these attacks will stop. 
So, this assumes the success of the operation to terminate Assad. 
CTU estimates successful probability at 75%. 
Oh, I think that's very generous. 
You know... It sounds to me like 
you're anticipating failure, Tom. 
I fully acknowledge, sir, that this is our only option. 
But I'm fervently advocating contingencies. 
Contingencies are willing good, Tom. 
But CTU needs to eliminate Assad. 
That's all there is to it. 
God knows were paying a steep enough price to get him. 
I've told you twenty times. 
You don't send that report without a certified header on it. 
This makes twenty-one, you should update your count. 
Do you... and I'm just curious, 
ever open your mouth without sarcasm just spilling out of it? 
Sorry, are we done here? 
Look, I'm just telling you to be careful otherwise you will find yourself back selling lady shoes in Beverly Hills. 
You're settling well into the whole management thing, aren't you? 
What's your problem with me? 
I like you fine as an analyst. 
Actually, you were very good. 
As a boss? 
Bit of a bull. 
What's going on? 
I talked to your boyfriend. 
He's on self distraught. 
You promised me to get along with Milo. 
I'm sorry darling. 
That's a promise I just can't keep. 
Morris. 
Morris! 
I had the same problem with the department head when I first started and I learned how to fit in. 
There's no reason why you can't. 
Except I don't happen to be a pretty lady. 
What are you talking about? 
 You're a hotty. 
 No, I'm not. 
Yes you are. Deal with it. 
 Morris, we're at work. 
 So? 
It's unprofessional. 
You say you don't like it? 
No, I'm not saying that. 
I just came go see if you got a request for Homeland on the priority channel. 
No. 
Why did they send it only to me? 
I don't know. 
Just try to get along. 
'Cause you asked... I will. 
Nadia. I just got a weird request 
from Homeland Security. 
They want to set up a channel and I want to clear with you first. 
Set yourself clear. 
They want it formatted according to military specs. 
Coordinating assault with the cover attack helicopters from Camp Pendleton. 
 When? 
 Thirty minutes. 
An assault on who? 
Assad. 
What are you talking about? 
We don't even know where Assad is. 
We will. We have a lead. 
No, we don't. 
If we did, I would know about it. 
We found a way to get Assad's location. 
How? 
Jack Bauer. 
Jack's in a Chinese prison. 
Not anymore. The President 
negociates his release two days ago. 
Jack's coming back? 
Yes. 
Why did the Chinese let him go? 
Why today? 
Does Assad have to do with the attacks? 
How do we think Jack's gonna lead us to Assad? 
Chloe, I can't talk about this... 
 Not yet. 
 Why not? 
Can Bill Buchanan talk about it? 
He's meeting Jack at Point Mugu Naval Air Station. 
Now, open that military channel. 
Put it through the conference area. 
The President wasn't giving up a lot to make this happen. 
I wish he were coming back under different circumstances. 
We don't know what his state of mind will be. 
If he doesn't cooperate, we need to be prepared. 
Mr Buchanan. 
I need your signature on this release document. 
Take those cuffs off him. 
Jack. 
It's okay. 
Come with me. 
Please convey to your President that Mister Bauer never broke his silence. 
He hasn't spoken a word in nearly two years. 
The President has paid a high price for Mr. Bauer's freedom. 
What he wants from him must be very important. 
President Palmer wants to speak to you himself as soon as we debriefe. 
I'm sorry, Jack. How could you know... 
Wayne Palmer is president. 
He's the one who negociated your release. 
I can't even begin to imagine what you went through, threre, Jack. 
There's a reason you're here now. 
The last eleven weeks, our cities have been targeted by... 
... a series of terror attacks. 
Buses, trains... shopping malls... 
The last one was fifteen minutes ago, here in Los Angeles. 
Hamir Al-Assad. 
Assad's here, Jack. 
Four days ago, one of Assad's men contacted us. 
He said he'd give up Assad for 25 million dollars. 
But he's demanding something more than money. 
He wants you, Jack. 
He wants you dead. 
It's Abou Fayed. 
He wants his pound of flesh for what happened in Beyrouth. 
We offered him... 
other alternatives, we did everything we could think of, Jack. 
But he will only agree to give us Assad in exchange for you. 
He's demanded our surveillance protocols. 
Which means we can't risk an extraction. 
Once he has you... 
... you'll be on your own. 
You understand what this means, Jack? 
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself so we can eliminate Assad. 
I can't hear you, Jack. 
Audrey? 
Audrey doesn't know you're back. 
My daughter? 
Kim doesn't know either. 
You'll keep it that way? 
I know what's being asked of me, Curtis. 
You don't need your firearm. 
Before we do this, I would like to clean up. 
We've got an area set up for you, and we brought you some new clothes. 
Bill? 
We have Jack. 
Good. 
I thought I was prepared, but he's... 
... worse than I expected. Much worse. 
I know how hard this must be for you, but everything depends on this operation. 
I understand. 
I know you do. 
I wish I were there with you. 
You're where you need to be. 
I miss you. 
I miss you too. 
About to take Jack to the drop point, now. 
Bye. 
Los Angeles has now been added to the list of major cities hit by terrorist attacks. 
The department of Homeland Security has raised the threat level to red, the highest level since the department was formed. 
FBI will handle all the field surges outside the city, so, just focus on the main grid. 
Nadia, I need to talk to you. 
Resetup and check back with me. 
Did you open that military channel, put it through to the conference area? 
I've tried to locate Bill or Curtis to find out what's going on with Jack. 
But they're both offline, their status is blocked. 
I told you, Chloe, I can't talk about this. 
Nadia, you've only been here a couple of months and you don't know me very well, but if you did, you would know how much Jack Bauer means to me. 
You would also know that sooner or later, I will find out. 
So why don't you just tell me right now? 
I don't have the authorisation. 
Why don't I just call Division, and let them know about the time that you left the Jarvis firewall unsecured? 
If it weren't for me, you would have been fired out of that. 
We were contacted 4 days ago by a man named Fayed. 
He offered to give us Assad's location for a list of demands and one of them was Jack Bauer. 
Jack? Why does he want Jack? 
Retribution. 
Retribution for what? 
Fayed's brother was part of the South * embassy, in Lebanon in 1999. 
Jack was sent to grab him and get the names of the other cell members. 
Fayed's brother died while Jack was interrogating him. 
Now he wants Jack dead. 
That's right. 
And you're really gonna just deliver Jack over to the terrorist to be killed? 
 Nadia! 
 We need to stop Assad. 
But why aren't we organizing a rescue? 
We can just grab Jack once Fayed gives us Assad's location. 
Fayed has the ressources to detect our surveillance. 
As part of the deal, we gave Fayed monitoring access to our satellite coverage, radio frequences and air corridors. 
He won't give us anything until he's free and clear with Jack. 
How do we even know he'll do what he says? 
We don't. 
I'm calling Karen Hayes. 
She'll talk to the President. 
Chloe, don't you get it? 
Karen already knows. 
So does President Palmer, he authorized it. 
Look... 
I'm sorry about your friend. 
But there's nothing you, I or anyone can do right now. 
This is our only way out of this crisis. 
If we want these attacks to stop, Jack Bauer has to be sacrificed. 
You've only gotten half those upgrades? 
You'll get the rest in a minute. 
I need them now, Morris. 
I needed them 10 minutes ago. 
And don't expect Chloe to keep running interference for you. 
I'll get your upgrades. 
When? 
What's going on between you and Nadia? 
The President got Jack back from the Chinese. 
He's in L.A, now. 
Well that's very good news. 
No, Morris. It's not. 
Bill, it's the President. 
Is Jack with you? 
Yes, sir. 
We're almost to the drop point. 
Let me speak to him, please. 
I'll put him on. 
It's President Palmer. 
He wants to talk you. 
Mister President? 
I've been... 
trying to think of what I could possibly say to you, after all that you've sacrificed for this country, what you've done for me in the past and of course, what you've done for my brother David. 
This is a desperate measure, Jack. 
Believe me, I know it's also a measure of our desperation. 
People are... 
... afraid to come outside. 
They're afraid to leave their homes, Jack. 
They're starting to turn against each other out there. 
Bill Buchanan explained the situation, sir. 
I know what's happening. 
I understand what's expected of me. 
You have my word, my word, Jack. 
Your sacrifice will not be in vain. 
Thank you. 
God bless you, Jack. 
Good bye, M. President. 
When I agreed to run for this office... 
... I thought that I understood 
this job. 
I mean I was right beside my brother David when he had... 
to make impossible decisions in no time. 
When he had to chose between bad options, but... 
Now that I'm the one sitting in that chair, I start to wonder if I am the right person to lead this country. 
It's an irrelevant question, sir. 
Excuse me ? 
You will lead this country, wether you want to or not. 
You are the President. 
But this president can't shake the feeling that sacrificing Jack Bauer is a mistake. 
And that maybe I should call this whole thing off  before it's too late. 
 No, sir. 
You have not made a mistake. 
And for what it's worth... 
your brother would be doing just the same thing. 
That doesn't make it right. 
It isn't right... 
it isn't wrong. 
It's simply our only option. 
Bauer has to be sacrificed so this country can survive. 
 I just heard a disturbing rumor. 
 And? 
What rumor is that? 
That you're authorizing the National Guard to set up detention facilities in conventions centers and sports arenas in Los Angeles, Detroit and Philadelphia. 
Yeah. Well, that's correct. 
That's against the President's order. 
I was there when he gave it. 
Karen, I know where you were. 
I was standing right next to you. 
To my knowledge, that order hasn't been resended. 
All right, you're confused. 
I haven't implemented anything yet, I merely positionning if the President changes his mind, as I suspect he will, then we would have wasted less time. 
I'm not confused, Tom. 
And you can use whatever word you like, in plain English you're second guessing the President. 
Plain English doesn't allow for the new answers that my job requires, Karen. 
And just how far are you gonna push this? 
The ACLU is already filing complaints against us that we've given the Bureau too much field authority. 
And by my lights they haven't been given near enough. 
They need a wider net with tighter mesh. 
Then what happens when innocent people get caught in that net? 
Well, like I told you before, security has its price. 
Just get used to it, Karen. 
 Go ahead. 
 Secure Bauer's wrist to the grid, then leave him there. 
First, tell me where Assad is. 
This isn't a negociation. 
If you want Assad, leave Bauer here, get back in your car and drive away. 
I'm watching you. 
You listen to me, you son of a bitch. 
He wants me to handcuff you to that grid. 
Do it. 
I don't know what to say, Jack. 
Do you understand the difference between dying for something and dying for nothing? 
The only reason I fought so hard to stay alive in China was because I didn't want to die for nothing. 
Today... 
I can die for something. 
My way, my choice. 
To be honest with you it'll have to be a relief. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
Don't be. 
Bill, you need to go. 
Go. 
Firemen are battling a fire at the Al-Ham-Sen mosque in Culver City. 
Members of the mosque are calling the incident a retaliation for this morning suicide bombing that happened downtown on the metro bus. 
Scott shouldn't be going to school. 
He has a geometry test. 
Honey, L.A. was just hit. I mean 
they should be close this schools down. 
They will close them down when it's not safe. 
But until then, I don't want to scare our son and I don't want you scaring him either. 
I want us to keep living our lives as normally as we can. 
Look, Gillian... 
There is nothing normal in what's happening here. 
What are we supposed to do? 
Just hide inside our house for the rest of our lives? 
Hey, was Ahmed able to help? 
I didn't get a chance to see him. 
The FBI are at his house. 
They're arresting his dad. 
What? 
 Why are they taking him? 
 I don't know. 
This is insane. You can't arrest 
somebody without a reason. 
He's not a terrorist. 
He's innocent. 
 It's got to be some reason. 
 I'm sure it's a mistake. 
Ahmed! What are you doing? 
We just wanna talk to you, okay? 
Ahmed, get outta here! 
It's that guy down the block. 
 A contractor Stan Something. 
 Yeah, I know. 
I'll call the police. 
Come on! 
Want you to get the hell out of my neighborhood ! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm helping Ahmed. 
 Your father is calling the police. 
 They won't do anything. 
Scott, stop. You're not going over here. 
Dad, I'm not hiding here while Ahmed gets beat up 'cause you're scared to do the right thing. 
Stay here ! 
I handle it. 
 I just wanna talk to you. 
 Get out of my house. 
We're just here to give you a little friendly advice, okay? 
Stan ! What the hell are you doing, man? 
Tryin' to protect my family, Ray. 
This kid's father is a terrorist. 
Come on he's no more a terrorist than you and me. 
Yeah? Then why did they arrest him? 
Because they're scared. 
 Like everyone else. 
 Oh, get outta my way. 
Hey, Stan ! Come on ! Stan... 
If you want him... 
you comin' through me. 
This isn't over, Ray. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
All right, look, hum, I-I think what we should do is you should come stay with us till things get sorted out with your father. 
Look, I appreciate what you just did but I'll be fine. 
Look, this guy this guy is a jerk and I don't want you staying here alone, it's dangerous. 
I-I'm not taking no for an answer. 
You come with me. 
 Nadia, Bill Buchanan for you. 
 All right. 
 Bill? 
 Jack's at the drop point. 
Are we set with the military? 
Marines have 2 cover attack helicopters ready to deploy we could hit any target inside L.A. within 20 minutes. 
Jack's giving his life for this operation. 
So I dont want any mistakes. 
Assad must be taken out with extreme prejudice. 
He will be searched as soon as we get his location with Fayed. 
If Fayed calls before I get back, loop me in. 
Yeah. 
 Bill? 
 Yeah? 
I'm sidelining Chloe on this operation. 
Why? 
She started asking questions about Jack. 
 II tried putting her off but... 
 What did you tell her? 
The truth. 
 I'll talk to her when I get there. 
 Thanks. 
Move over. 
What are you doing? 
Gonna try get a visual on Jack. 
I told you, Fayed has our surveillance protocols. 
He's monitoring full spectrum radio satellite orders and transmissions. 
I had acces to a satellite that's off the government's grid. 
How? 
I did a drop of work for this energy consortium in Pakistan. 
They needed an illegal aerial survey for some oil fields. 
I needed some big cash. 
Look, the little bird she's still flying, she's still flying. 
I think I can reposition the camera from here. 
 Morris... 
 Ah, don't thank me yet, love Just stop sulking and find out where Bill Buchanan left Jack. 
I've been waiting for this for a long time. 
 Yes. 
 There is a problem. 
Don't move out of the tunnel yet. 
 What? 
 I've just intercepted a signal to a privatly owned satellite. 
There are hundreds of private satellites. 
The signal is beeing transmitted on a government frequency. 
This satellite, what's it looking at? 
I can't pinpoint it but the cameras has been repositionned to your sector. 
Connect me to CTU. 
Chloe, this is it, this is it! 
As soon as the military has Assad's location, we'll work with local law enforcement to limit collateral damage. 
As much as we are trying to prevent civilian losses our priority, just take out Assad. 
Fayed is on the line. 
This is Nadia Yassir. 
Redirect the satellite you have aimed at this sector. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Then explain the activity on frequency Alpha-0-7-0-3. 
Bauer is dead either way. 
But if you don't redirect that satellite in 30 seconds, you will loose Assad. 
I'm telling you there is no satellite. 
28 seconds. 
Where is this coming from? 
 Inside the building. 
 Where? 
Chloe's station. 
Morris. 
Redirect that satellite! 
 Redirect that satellite! 
 Situation is under control. 
No, Fayed hacked your transmission. 
We may have lost our only chance of locating Assad. 
Fayed, this was a rogue operation. 
 Redirecting the satellite now. 
 You have ten seconds. 
 Morris, do it! 
 Nine... 
 Come on, hurry up! 
 I'm going as fast as I can. 
Six... 
Five... 
Four... 
It's done. 
It's moving away, Fayed. 
They redirected the satellite. 
 Other channels? 
 All clear. 
Because of your deception, I will have to think about giving you Assad's location. 
But, what about our deal? 
Fayed? 
 We may have spooked Fayed. 
 I heard what happened. 
Damn it! What were you thinking? 
It's my fault, you can fire me. 
I'd fire both of you right now but I can't afford to loose the man power. 
 Look at me. 
 I'd rather not, sir. 
Look at me. 
Don't think you're the only one mourning Jack, you're not. 
That may be our only option. 
You both better hope to God you just didn't blow it, we may have sacrificed Jack for nothing. 
 Buchanan. 
 Bill, have you heard from Fayed? 
 Not yet, no. 
 The President's worried. 
Fayed should have contacted us by now. 
There may be a problem. 
There is a possibility Fayed is going back on the deal. 
What are you talking about? 
He caught us trying to track Jack. 
The orders were that he was to have a clear field. 
I know what the orders were. 
Chloe thought there was a workaround she did it without our authorization. 
Damn it, Bill! 
She's your responsability. 
How could you let this happen? 
If we don't take out Assad, then... 
I don't need a lecture. 
 Karen, I know what the stakes are. 
 I don't think you do. 
If these attacks don't stop, there are people in this administration who are willing to tear up the constitution in the name of national security. 
The things that they're talking about doing this country will never recover. 
As soon as I hear from Fayed you'll be my first call. 
I'm sorry, Bill. It's just, I'm... 
There is no need to apologize, we're all fear*, here. 
I have to go. 
Anything? 
 Clear  Are you sure? 
Yes, they are leaving us alone. 
The money's been transfered, should we call CTU? 
Not yet. 
You need to call CTU. 
I won't let you die until I'm ready. 
The chinese, they leave much for me to work with. 
But, before you die, you're going to feel what my brother felt. 
I saw his body. 
I know how he died. 
I know what you did to him. 
You don't need me to tell you... 
that the nerves are bundled... 
here. 
You need to give CTU Assad's location. 
That was the deal. 
Assad, has lost faith in our fight. 
He thinks our tactics are failing. 
He's begun talking about, compromise. 
About laying down our arms and negociating. 
But there is no compromise nor negociation. 
Assad... 
is a traitor. 
And soon, inch� Allah, he will be dead. 
That's right, Jack. 
CTU is about to kill their own man. 
Assad, isn't behind these attacks. 
He's come here to stop them. 
He's come here, to stop me. 
You will die for nothing. 
If Fayed doesn't call in 5 minutes, reassign everyone here. 
 This is Buchanan. 
 You kept your end of the deal,  I'll keep mine. 
 I'm listening. 
I have a transponder at Assad's location. 
33-58-11 north latitude. 
100-18-21-40 west longtitude. 
You'll find Assad there. 
 Where is that? 
 It's coming. 
Inglewood. 
Have general Bowen mobilize the attack helicopters I'll let the President know we're a go. 
Cut off Fayed access to all our surveillance. 
I want a lockdown on all of our satellites. 
Shut them down, you got it? 
We did everything we could. 
I know it's truly awfull, but if it stops these attacks, it's for the greater good. 
There is no one that understands that more than Jack. 
Do you remember doing this to my brother? 
 Fayed? 
 What is it? 
There is a call for you. 
It's important. 
Yes? 
There is a problem. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 The FBI, they took my father. 
Where are you? 
I'm at the neighbours'. 
Fayed, you know my father is innocent, he has no idea of what we're doing. 
If your father is meant to be sacrificed... 
... that is how it will be. 
Now, tell me what the FBI said. 
Good. 
You did the right thing. 
Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package? 
 Yes, it's well hidden. 
 You need to deliver it soon. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
It was just my uncle he's trying to find out where they took my dad. 
 You want to come in? 
 Yeah. 
Get in there! He got away. 
Find him! 
=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents 24ep06 MAN: Going down! No! 
WAYNE:  How many people died in this? 
No less than 12,000. 
Four more tactical nuclear weapons were stolen along with the one that went off. 
 CTU was trying to determine where Fayed was at the time. 
The worst case scenario is that he is still alive and in possession of the remaining nuclear weapons. 
My engineer died in the blast. 
The device used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed as well. 
 I have four more bombs  whose triggers need to be made operational. 
We need someone who could replicate what that device did, with modern equipment. 
McCarthy will find someone for us. 
Tell the man these bombs will go off today. 
Walid overheard some conversations about the bombs. 
 If there is an active  shell inside  that detention facility,  we need Walid to find out more. 
He's wiring you. 
It's a two-way radio. 
Now you're going to tell me what we found in your wallet, you understand me? 
(grunts) You're going to say that I asked about this man. 
Got to make them believe you're working for them. 
What if they find out he's wearing a wire? 
The guards inside know what's going on. 
They'll keep an eye on him. 
I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex-Soviet general about the cache of tactical nuclear weapons. 
What was the name of the general? 
Dmitri Gredenko. 
Assad just gave us the name of a Russian general Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes. 
 Gredenko did business  with BXJ Technologies,  specifically with your father. 
My father? 
I haven't spoken to him for over nine years. 
Well, we'll send someone over to talk to him. 
I should do this. 
He'll talk to me, if I go alone. 
You will never guess who just called here. 
Who? 
Your brother Jack. 
 What's he want? 
He's looking for the old man. 
Damn it, we should have killed Jack when we had the chance, instead of handing him over to the Chinese. 
Look at the bright side: you got out you're here so just relax a little bit. 
Gray, people in this country are dying. 
And I need some information. 
Are you going to give it to me or do I have to start hurting you? 
I told you I don't know where Dad is. 
What do you want from me? 
The truth! 
That is the truth. 
I swear to you on my family's life. 
Not good enough. 
(sudden shout) WAYNE: Although the crisis we face today is a grave and dire one, we will rise above it. 
We have been challenged as never before. 
This time, against this enemy, armed with these weapons, we must rely on the strength and faith of every single American. 
And that faith is unshakable. 
We must rise above our fears, above our bigotries and stand our ground. 
Our goal is the defeat of the enemy and the preservation of our values. 
We've achieved that goal in the past. 
And so we shall again. 
Thank you. 
I wish he had not said that. 
Sir? 
Made a promise he can't keep. 
The American people have got to get used to the fact these security measures are a way of life, they're not some temporary Band-Aid. 
Now you're making policy unilaterally, Tom. 
The president was absolutely clear about your proposals. 
I'm sorry, what is this about, Karen? 
"National Guard supplanting police "in major cities, expanding detentions based on soft intel." 
You authorized these without presidential consent. 
Now how many times do you think we are going to be going over this? 
I am taking preparatory steps to allow the president to act swiftly, should he decide to act at all. 
Nobody is authorizing anything. 
That's what you said about the detention facilities, and yet those "preparatory measures" turned into an illegal paramilitary operation. 
Well, however you may choose to characterize it, The president agreed to all of these actions... 
That's because you've distorted the facts. 
What is it, Tom? 
Is it that you think I'm some bleeding heart liberal preaching civil liberties is that it? 
I'll tell you what I think. 
The Constitution is a wonderful thing, Karen, but back in the days of the Founding Fathers, the weapon at hand was a single-shot musket. 
It took a half a minute to load and fire. 
Fayed just killed 12,000 people in less time without even taking aim. 
I love the Constitution, but I won't be ducking behind it when the next nuke goes off. 
I'm a realist, too, Tom, and I am willing to do what it takes to protect this country... 
No, you are not! 
But I am looking a little further down the road. 
These warrantless arrests and detention centers will cause irreparable damage to this country. 
Hey, you know something? 
Why don't you just hop a shuttle over to Justice Department... 
You are using this crisis... 
You don't belong in National Security. 
...to advance a very 
dangerous agenda, Tom, and take advantage of Presidential power. 
You know something? 
I'm done in here. 
And I will not let you do it. 
And if you think that you are going to wear me down, you are sadly mistaken. 
Actually, you're wearing me down. 
No, that's right, you won't make the same mistake again, because you're going to give the file to Sharon, she's going to handle it from there. 
No, get it done. 
I need Karen Hayes to go away. 
I'm putting the last ties on that... 
I need this now. 
I need the president to sign off on my proposals. 
She has gone from being an irritant to an obstacle. 
And she will be gone soon, sir, I promise. 
I'm just waiting to hear back from a few more people, then you can approach her. 
This work you're doing for me, it doesn't go unnoticed. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr. Buchanan. 
Yes. 
Are you aware of the internal security mandate that's just been issued? 
I haven't looked at the hourlies yet. 
What's going on? 
Anyone identified with a Middle Eastern background is required to put a redundancy layer on all their log-ins. 
I see. 
Look, normally, I'm not sensitive to this kind of thing, you know that, but this is not the time to be racially profiling people who have grade-four security clearance. 
I agree, I'm not going to argue with you. 
Good-- so you give me an exemption? 
I'll take this issue to the attorney general, but it's not going to happen right away. 
Well, how am I supposed to work with one hand tied behind my back? 
Listen, you and I both knew when I hired you that a Muslim working counter-terror in the United States was going to have to put up with some unfair measures-- this is one of them. 
I know. 
But today, of all days... 
Especially today. 
I need you to stay focused on the big picture. 
When this is behind us, I will take this issue to the attorney general, I promise you. 
Have we heard from Jack yet? 
Not since he went to go see his brother. 
Want me to try and reach him? 
No. He'll call us 
when he has something. 
(muffled grunt, rapid gasping) (explosive cough, wheezing) You lie to me again, the bag goes back on. 
Do you understand me? 
(raspy coughing) Start talking, Gray! 
(gasping): Dad... 
Dad didn't want anyone to know where he went. 
He didn't even leave a number, in case of an emergency? 
No, you can't reach him, Jack. 
(catching breath): After the bomb was... 
detonated, he told me he was cutting himself off. 
(crying quietly) I don't believe you. 
(sobs loudly) I think he told you where he was going. 
No, no! It's the truth! 
Fine... 
No, no! 
I don't know! I don't know! 
All right, all right, all right, all right! 
(growling gasps) He went to see a... 
a guy who works for us. 
His name's Darren McCarthy. 
Why? 
It was my fault. 
I made a mess. 
Dad's trying to clean it up. 
What do you mean? 
You were right. 
It's about the nukes. 
(sighs, gasps) The connection you found between Dad and Gredenko had to do with a... a contract 
that was awarded to us. 
Through the company? 
Yeah, it all went through BXJ. 
What did an ex-Russian general have to do with the contract? 
It was his job... to release 
the old nukes into the U.S. 
for decommissioning. 
BXJ was hired to dismantle some of the smaller bombs and to recycle their cores into energy production we do it all the time. 
What happened? 
(heavy sigh) I hired McCarthy to oversee the job, but I didn't check him out carefully enough. 
So, basically, he came in with the lowest bid and you just hired him! 
I-I... M-My head was into 
other things at the time. 
I-I-I... H-He came in 
with good references. 
I saw no reason to get all anal about it. 
So the nukes that these terrorists are in possession of, including the one that was just detonated in Valencia, were supplied by McCarthy and stolen from you. 
Yes, in a nutshell, that's it. 
Sam told me Dad left yesterday... 
which means that you and he knew about this before today, and you didn't report it. 
We didn't report it because we thought we could take care of it more efficiently. 
Damn it, Gray! 
Do you know how many people have died because you're trying to cover your ass?! 
We had no idea that this was going to happen. 
And besides, what Dad and I are doing to stop this is more effective than what you and your people are gonna do. 
What, exactly, are you doing? 
Dad put together a security team and he went out to look for McCarthy. 
Where? 
He was staking out McCarthy's office. 
He checked in about an hour ago. 
Where is this office? 
He's in Simi. 
We're going. 
I'm not leaving my family, Jack. 
Not today. 
Oh, yes, you are. 
Get up! 
Graem, where are you going? 
Jack and I have to go find Dad. 
What do you mean, find him? 
He's not reachable right now; we have to go out  and pick him up-- I want you to stay here, all right? 
You stay with Josh, don't either of you go outside the house. 
I'll be back as soon as I can. 
What's the address? 
McCarthy's office is off the 23. 
5137 Olson Avenue. 
Who are you calling? 
(phone ringing) CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Let me speak to Bill. 
He's being briefed on Fayed. 
Have you picked up any threads? 
Not yet. 
I've got one-- I want you to send two field units to 5137 Olson Avenue, in Simi Valley. 
It should be off the 23. 
I want them to wait for me there. 
Get Bill to call me back as soon as he's out of the briefing. 
Okay, I will. 
So that's it, Jack, huh? 
You're just gonna sell out Dad and me. 
We've been monitoring ground movement ever since the bomb went off. 
We locked down streets, we're doing vehicle searches so far, nothing. 
No sign of Fayed. 
MORRIS: Which means he could still hunkered down within the perimeter-- what are we doing about that? 
We've got NEST teams in the area now. 
They're going street by street. 
That'll take hours. 
Yeah, Morris, it's all going to take time. 
If we could do it quicker, we would. 
We can use the direction of the fallout to our advantage. 
If Fayed is still in the perimeter, he'll be moving in the opposite direction. 
And he'll have to be monitoring the fallout. 
Which means he's got technology in the "on" position. 
Let's use radio frequency satellite, see what we can come up with. 
Good. 
Get on it. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
Jack just called in. 
He's following some kind of lead in Simi Valley. 
He wants you to call him right away. 
Anything else? 
Nothing. 
He asked me to send two teams to meet him. 
Any leads on finding Gredenko? 
Not yet. 
CIA is trying to track him down in Moscow. 
Okay, thank you. 
If you give CTU McCarthy's name, they will eventually come after the family. 
That is not necessarily true. 
CTU is interested in finding these bombs, not networking a series of indictments. 
Oh, will you not be so simple-minded for once in your life! 
CTU, like every other federal organization, is made up of human beings with ambition. 
When the dust settles, they will start digging deeper, you can count on it. 
Well, unfortunately for you, Gray, right now you're going to have to trust me. 
Trust you? After what you 
did to me at the house, all I trust in is your sadistic tendencies. 
(cell phone ringing) This is Bauer. 
What'd you find out? 
Bill, I want you to run a locater check on a Darren McCarthy. 
Who is he? 
He was an independent munitions contractor. 
He worked for BXJ Technologies. 
How does McCarthy figure into all this? 
My father's company hired him to decommission the nukes. 
I believe he brokered them to Fayed. 
So except for McCarthy, your father's company had nothing to do with Fayed? 
I don't know BXJ's involvement yet. 
All right, we're on it. 
Where are you? 
I'm heading to McCarthy's office in Simi Valley. 
I don't think he's there, but I might be able to get something off his computer. 
We have teams standing by. 
Let me know. 
Copy that. 
(phone snaps shut) You know, if you're doing this to come after me, eventually Dad will get caught in the middle. 
Or maybe you want that, maybe you want Dad to go to prison, too. 
Boy, Jack... 
it's good to see your loyalty's still with your family. 
If I were you, I wouldn't talk about loyalty. 
McCARTHY: I know it's not easy, that's why they're willing to pay $7 million cash. 
What about Taylor Paskal, why can't he do it? 
MAN (on phone): He's a theoretical physicist. 
He doesn't have enough practical background to reprogram a nuclear trigger. 
Who does? 
I'm still looking. 
Fayed needs someone now; get me a name, damn it! 
(slams phone down) Where are we going now? 
What do you care where we're going? 
Darren, I don't feel safe in this city. 
I was here when you mentioned that earlier. 
Okay... It seems to me 
like whatever this is you're trying to do is a long shot. 
You're just going to waste all this time and it's going to be harder to get away. 
(tires screeching) Get out. 
What?! 
Your negativity is not what I need right now. 
I need less stress, not more. 
(gasping) (wry laugh) How sure a thing... 
is this $7 million? 
Now that's the type of question that I love hearing from you. 
(cell phone ringing) Yeah. 
Have you found an engineer? 
Not yet. 
Why not? 
(sighs): Give me a break, Fayed. 
This is not some easy one-stop shopping. 
You said within the hour. 
I know what I said. 
It's just taking longer. 
I told you I'd find someone and I will. 
(closes phone) SAMUELS: That's the last of the group. 
So what do you do with them now? 
Patch the images over to CTU. 
They can cross them with international watch lists. 
Didn't you already vet these people? 
CTU has more resources. 
They can go deeper, find the connection to Fayed. 
Samuels just sent us images of the men Walid is undercover with. 
MORRIS: Excellent. 
Send them to my system, when Nadia gets me the manifest; I'll cross them against all of our watch lists. 
Wait... Nadia didn't get you 
the manifests yet? 
No. 
Why not? 
I haven't a clue, mate. 
Hey, you were supposed to send the manifest from the detention facility over to comm. 
Why don't we have it yet? 
I'm backed up. 
Well, why are you backed up? 
Milo, I'm doing the best that I can here. 
You got a problem with it, take it somewhere else. 
Hey... 
I'm just trying to understand what the problem is. 
The detention facility's one of the only live leads we have. 
Go ask Buchanan. 
Okay. 
We've got a support team in place, if Jack needs more backup, he'll let you know. 
Yeah. 
What is it, Milo? 
Nadia. 
She's falling behind on her tasks. 
What's going on with her? 
Nothing. 
Petition her workload and hand some of it off to another analyst. 
I've only got her working on one process. 
She's doing some things for me directly, Milo. 
Just do it, please. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
with all due respect, is there something going on here you don't want me to know about? 
Yes, there is, Milo. 
Either give Nadia enough time to finish the work, or give the work to somebody else. 
Sir, I'm the technical leader on the floor. 
If you want me to do my job effectively, I need to know what's happening. 
Because Nadia's of Middle Eastern descent, she's been flagged by Homeland Security. 
That's ridiculous. 
She's... lived in this country 
since she was two years old. 
She's... a registered 
Republican, for crying out loud. 
You're wasting your breath, Milo there's nothing I can do about this right now. 
Let it go, will you please? 
No, sir, I don't see how we can just "let it go." 
Aren't we trying to find four suitcase nukes that might still be in this city? 
Milo... 
I need everyone on the floor working at full speed. 
I understand that, Milo. 
Now get back to work. 
Yes, sir. 
(phone ringing) Yeah, hi. 
Have you heard about this latest mandate from Homeland Security? 
No, why. What is it? 
They're racially profiling our own agents. 
What?! 
It just came down from the White House. 
The problem is one of my best people is hamstrung. 
She has to work twice as hard to get through these security measures. 
They're not security measures, Bill. 
They're the paranoid delusions of Tom Lennox. 
Is there anything you can do? 
I can talk to the president. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
(hangs up phone) He went off to Valencia over an hour ago. 
How many were killed? 
We don't know yet. 
(over speaker): They say there are four more visitors. 
WALID: Four more visitors. 
What does that mean? 
I'm not sure. 
But you think it may have something to do with what happened in Valencia? 
How did you get the information? 
Why are you asking so many questions? 
Whatever happens out there affects us in here. 
We need to share  everything we know. 
Heydar has been in contact. 
How? 
He smuggled in a cell phone. 
How did you do that? 
Cell phone? How did he get 
a cell phone in there? 
These facilities were put up quickly. 
The security's still pretty porous. 
Then we need to get this man's phone and find out who he's talking to. 
If Walid can get the phone, I can trace any call that's been  made from it. 
If I can get a live conversation, that's worth more than a list  of phone numbers. 
Fine. Then, after that, 
get Walid out of there. 
No. They're talking to him now. 
That's a big get. 
We have to keep listening in on whatever they say. 
This is Agent Samuels. 
I'm going to need to get into a cell tower grid location: 15 comma twenty-seven. 
It's done. 
All these people will come forward if we need them to testify? 
Yes. I put the screws 
to every one of them myself. 
They're all yours. 
Good. 
Oh, Karen... 
I need to talk to you. 
Just a minute. 
 Now would be better. 
Have this signed, and then send it out. 
This, uh, this just simply isn't working for me. 
I can't have you stand in my way anymore. 
What? 
I need the president's undivided attention, and you, frankly, are dividing it. 
Well, I'm not going to stop doing my job, Tom, just because it irritates you. 
I thought I made that  perfectly clear. 
Yeah. I'd like you to tend 
your resignation, Karen. 
(scoffs) My resignation? 
What are you smoking? 
No, no, no. I'm here 
to blow away all of the smoke. 
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence, and your covering it up. 
I don't like this conversation. 
What are you talking about? 
14 months ago, we had Abu Fayed in CTU custody in Seattle, and Bill Buchanan signed off on his release. 
I don't believe this. 
The case that you're referring to, if I remember correctly, involved over 20 detainees. 
Not prisoners, Tom. 
Detainees. 
And, at the time, there was not enough evidence to hold them. 
It's just a little grayer than that, now, isn't it? 
If what you're saying is true, how come that incident wound up blue-coded at Homeland in a dead-end file? 
I got Peter Iannone here, Kurt Hueig, Myra Mawk... 
They were all in the pipeline all ready to testify that you sequestered that file to protect your husband.  
I did nothing illegal or incorrect! 
Every single one of those detainees were cleared of any conspiracy charges. 
Nevertheless, one of these detainees detonated a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. 
You think your husband could survive that story? 
Or you, for that matter? 
Do you want to get in the ring with me, Tom? 
You've got skeletons in your closet, and I will not hesitate to pull them out. 
We've all got our skeletons, Karen. 
It's proof we don't all have. 
I've got mine. 
How long before you get yours? 
You're a son of a bitch. 
I never claimed otherwise. 
But I am not out to hurt you or your husband personally. 
I just need room to work. 
Your resignation within the hour. 
Can we go a little slower? 
There's no rush. 
Morris, I'm going as fast as I can. 
Why don't you just go back to your station? 
I'll send it over as soon as I'm ready. 
No, I'm curious as to why it's taking you five minutes to do something that should take ten seconds. 
Because I borrowed two of her processors to run a batch job. 
She's running on 20%. 
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't 
somebody tell me this? 
I just did. 
Fine. But don't 
keep any secrets from me, darling. 
We're on the same side. 
Why'd you lie for me? 
I talked to Buchanan. 
Yeah, it's pretty frustrating. 
I'm sure. 
What are you doing? 
I'm logging you in under my user I.D. 
That's illegal. 
And you didn't do it, I did. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, you should... 
be fine. 
(quiet conversation) Excuse me, Mr. President, 
I need to speak with you. 
Karen, I'm a little squeezed for time right now. 
Can we talk later? 
No, sir, we can't. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President, I am tendering 
my resignation, effective immediately. 
What's going on, Karen? 
It's a personal matter, sir. 
Is there something wrong with you or Bill? 
No, we're fine. 
It's... I cannot elaborate. 
I've noticed that you and Tom have been locking horns these past few weeks. 
Is that what this is about? 
Sir, I would rather not say. 
Damn it, Karen, that is unacceptable. 
Mr. President... 
I need you! 
I need different points of view. 
Now I understand it's difficult to sit in a room with someone who opposes you constantly, but that is part of your job. 
And I have never seen anyone handle it better than you. 
Now I am sorry, Karen, but I cannot accept your resignation. 
Not now, not today. 
No disrespect, sir, but you're going to have to. 
Mr. President, 
I'm here to tell you that the past few weeks have been some of the must difficult weeks that I have ever seen a president face. 
And I am truly honored to serve under you here in Washington. 
And I appreciate that you value my advice, but, sir, the truth is, you have been your own best counselor. 
You know what to do, sir. 
And I have no doubt, absolutely no doubt... 
that you will continue to rise to this challenge. 
Is there anything I can do to change your mind? 
No, sir, there is not. 
I would appreciate it, however, if you would reassign me to L.A. CTU. 
I feel I will serve best there. 
I'll approve you for military transport west. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr. President. 
I'm sorry. 
So am I. 
Oh. 
Oh. 
Excuse me, Karen, I'm so sorry. 
Oh, actually, Karen, I'm glad I caught you. 
I've got a State Department white paper I was hoping you could look over and then take to the president. 
No, you'll have to give it to Tom. 
Well, I thought you handled that. 
Give it to Tom. 
Excuse me. 
(phone ringing) Yes. 
Karen Hayes is out. 
The last one is a black Kia, California license plate Niner, Yankee, Sierra, Uniform, 1-0-8. 
That one's not registered to McCarthy either. 
Okay, I want you to cross-reference the names with registered owners, see if any of them correlate. 
What do you want me to do with the backup teams? 
Where are they? 
They're holding a two-block radius. 
Send one of them over to the parking lot here, tell the other to stand by. 
I'll get back to you. 
Where's McCarthy's office? 
What floor? 
Second floor. 
Let's go. 
You all right? 
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. 
All right, I've got the phone. 
Good. I'm going to give you 
a number to dial then CTU will be able to access the phone's records. 
After dialing the number, hit the star button twice. 
The number is 310-597-3781. 
Again, the number: 310-597-3781. 
Once we get everything off the SIM, I'll let you know, you can put the phone back. 
All right, but hurry. 
It won't be long before he discovers it's missing. 
He got the phone. 
There's nothing else he can do. 
Well, let's just see what we get. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Agent Samuels. 
We've got the phone. 
I'm piping a byte stream to you now. 
Work up every number you get. 
All right, it's coming through. 
What's it look like? 
This data's encoded. 
It looks like there's over 120 numbers or so. 
I can't tell if they're recently dialed or stored. 
I'll untangle it and get back to you in a few minutes. 
But you got everything, right? 
Yeah. 
Walid did a great job of getting that phone. 
Then please let him go before he gets hurt. 
I'm going to tell you one last time, Ms. Palmer 
these men know something about the bombs that we don't. 
Walid has earned their trust. 
That's a situation that we've lucked into. 
And we will not terminate it as long as he can continue to harvest information. 
All right, Walid, you can put the phone back. 
Okay. 
(phone rings) Yeah, Chloe. 
I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone. 
What are you talking about? 
They knew about the other four bombs. 
They found out from a web page. 
What? 
The cell phone had a browser on it. 
The cache had a web page. 
It wasn't public, but they could've connected in. 
Was the Web site password protected? 
No. These pages 
come and go. 
But a lot of people know about them. 
These guys aren't terrorists they're just spectators. 
Why didn't they report the Web site? 
Because you have them locked up for having terrorist links! 
Why would they give you information that, in your eyes, would incriminate them even further. 
All right, thanks, Chloe. 
I'm getting Walid the hell out of there. 
This is Agent Samuels. 
Notify the guards. 
We are taking Walid Al-Rezani out. 
I was at home with my wife and my children, and they barged right in and the grabbed me. 
No search warrant, nothing. 
And they say this country is about freedom. 
This is not freedom. 
My phone. 
It's gone. 
What do you mean it's gone? 
I just had it over there. 
You... You took it. 
No, I did not take your phone. 
Yes, he did. 
I was walking back here. 
He fell in front of me. 
Search him. 
No, get away from me. 
Open the gate. 
Can't do that, ma'am. 
I need to get in there right now. 
What are you doing? 
You spied on us? 
You're worse than they are! 
You son of a bitch! 
Heydar, no! 
(shouting) Let us in. 
(clamoring) Walid, Walid. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm okay. 
Oh, no, no, you're not. 
You're hurt. 
I need a medical team on site now. 
I've got a civilian down. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, we're here. 
The parking lot's almost empty. 
Yeah, the building's been evacuated because of the bomb. 
Does Jack want us in there? 
No, hold your positions. 
Keep an eye on all the exits and entrances; wait for my call. 
All right. Standing by. 
Which one's his office? 
Last door on the right. 
Let's go. 
Take a seat. 
What are you doing? 
I'm looking for anything in McCarthy's system that connects him to BXJ or the nukes. 
What's that? 
That's McCarthy's employment contract with BXJ. 
Whoa, whoa! What happened there? 
Some kind of electronic shredding trail. 
Look at the time code. 
Ten minutes after the bomb went off, McCarthy started shredding files. 
(door bangs) (whispers): Get up... now. 
Come on, Jack! 
Don't make a noise. 
(light tap) (louder tap) Don't you move. 
(grunts) Stop. 
You know him? 
Yeah. 
He's my son. 
I'm surprised to see you here, Jack. 
We all feared the worst. 
Give me my gun back. 
What are you doing here, Jack? 
I'm working with CTU. 
We're looking for Darren McCarthy. 
McCarthy's not here. 
I know what you're trying to cover up, Dad. 
Gray already told me. 
Did he? And where is he? 
McCarthy's office. 
There's nothing there, Jack, believe me. 
Get Graem in here. 
Wait. 
You'll need these. 
I didn't trust him not to run. 
I'm doing everything I can to find McCarthy. 
What in the hell are you thinking, trying to do this on your own? 
I only learned about it yesterday. 
When Graem told me about the diverted weapons... 
The second you knew the bombs were missing, why didn't you call the authorities? 
He told me that the bombs couldn't be detonated; the triggers were deactivated. 
He was wrong. 
Evidently! 
Look, Jack, I'm just trying to keep my son out of prison. 
Dad, where is McCarthy? 
I don't know. 
When I do, we can pick him up together. 
That's not what he wants, Dad. 
He wants us both in prison. 
What I want is to find the nukes. 
If you're held accountable for what you've done, that's the bed you've made. 
You hear that, Dad? 
You hear that family love? 
We'd be better off if he was still rotting away in a Chinese jail. 
Who are you calling? 
CTU. 
Jack, look, work with me. 
I'll tell you what I know, but for now, keep Graem out of it. 
We're talking about prison, Jack. 
He's your brother. 
Graem knew what he was doing was wrong. 
He was responsible for those nukes. 
He should have been more careful. 
And the second he knew they were stolen, he should have reported it! 
Oh, you always do what you should, right, Jack? 
How about when Dad needed you and you disappeared? 
Come on, Jack, give us a chance to clean this up. 
Dad, there are four more bombs out there. 
I cannot I will not be responsible for thousands and thousands of lives just to try and protect this family. 
Wrong! Protecting family is 
everything, and I think your dead wife would agree. 
You son of a bitch! 
Jack! 
All right, let's do it your way. 
No, Dad! 
No, no, no, he's right. 
Call CTU. 
I don't think so. 
Hey, what are you doing?! 
Put the gun away. 
You work for me. 
No, Dad, he doesn't. 
This is insane. 
You don't think I'd let you run loose without keeping an eye on you, do you? 
Tell them to put the guns away. 
Shut up, Dad. 
Well, I'm glad we can all finally put our cards on the table. 
Family. (scoffs) 
Let's go. 
Yeah, talk to me. 
Yeah, so? 
You think you can get him? 
And he hasn't left town? 
Okay, text me everything you've got on him. 
They're looking for you at your place. 
What makes you think they can't find you here? 
A: Because I'm not that stupid, and B: Because we're not going to be here long enough for anyone to know. 
I really hope you know what you're doing, Darren. 
Always. 
And when I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country. 
As long as it's not Palm Springs. 
Everything's been handled. 
We're clear to go. 
Good. Let's move. 
Good God. 
What have you done? 
Jack forced my hand. 
Call me when it's over. 
=TLF SUB TEAM= http://tlfsub.eastgame.net 
Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country, enters the United States, detonates a nuclear bomb killing thousands. 
Next, Assad attempts to assassinate the president. 
AMBASSADOR:  You know fully well  that we have cooperated with you since the inception of this crisis. 
I had an understanding with your president. 
And now you're going to have one with me. 
You help us find those nukes before another goes off, or I'm going to unleash the full power of our military on your country. 
VASILI: I'm terminating the American. 
Do you confirm? 
Yes. 
(grunting) MARKOV:  The American has shot Vasili. 
He's in the basement. 
Shut down the phone lines, DSL,  everything! 
JACK:  Morris, it's Jack. 
I know how to find Gredenko. 
He's in the... 
(dial tone) Morris? 
Jack? Jack? 
Jack Bauer's currently being held captive  in the Russian consulate. 
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate. 
DOYLE:  Our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul. 
According to Jack, Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the remaining three suitcase nukes. 
The Americans are coming in. 
I thought you had that under control. 
 Won't be long  before they have your position. 
This drone is ready to launch. 
Arm the bomb. 
What's going on at the Russian consulate? 
Jack Bauer's still at large and somewhere inside. 
 We have to go in. 
Drop your weapon! 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
You need to contact Bill Buchanan. 
Tell him that Fayed and Gredenko are in the Shadow Valley. 
Patch me in with Buchanan. 
(indistinct radio transmissions) Medevac's on the way. 
How you holding up? 
I'm fine. 
Doc? 
He may have floating rib fragments  which could cause internal bleeding. 
He needs to be stabilized. 
Agent Doyle, I told you I'm fine. 
I want to be involved in this mission. 
CTU has the ball, Jack. 
Right now, this is out of your hands. 
We now believe Gredenko is in possession of at least five RQ-2 Aerial Drones (over speakerphone): somewhere in Shadow Valley. 
RQ-2s? 
Unmanned stealth aircraft which can be remotely piloted from anywhere in the world. 
And Gredenko's arming them with the nuclear weapons he provided to Fayed? 
Yes, sir. 
We're redirecting satellite coverage over the Mojave Desert, and the Air Force is scrambling F-16s from Edwards. 
But you have no idea how close Fayed and Gredenko are to launching these drones? 
No, sir, we don't. 
(sighs): All right, Bill. 
You keep me updated. 
Yes, sir. 
GREDENKO: Bring the trucks around. 
We are moving out now. 
What's wrong? 
How many drones have been armed? 
Just this one. 
GREDENKO: Damn it. 
We need to launch it now. 
Get it ready. 
Go, go. 
Tell me what's wrong. 
What's wrong? 
The Americans know our location. 
How? 
It was Markov, huh? 
Markov told them. 
All that matters is that they know we are here. 
We need to launch the drone before they close in. 
We have three bombs and three targets. 
We'll find a way to deliver the other two bombs. 
All this time we've tolerated your condescension, berating us for losing the other bombs. 
But now it's your fault. 
Markov was your man. 
Blame me all you want, but if we stay here, we'll be captured or killed. 
Refit the other bombs into their casings and load them on the truck. 
Do it now! 
Take them out! 
We're accelerating our schedule. 
Why? 
I don't have time to explain. 
I need you to launch drone 0-7-0-9. 
I haven't finished implementing the evasion vectors. 
They'll shoot it down before it reaches its target. 
Launch the drone. 
You'll execute evasion tactics once it's in the air. 
Yes, sir. 
(engine whooshing) We need to leave now. 
Come on, let's go. 
We're repositioning our satellites as fast as we can, sir. 
As soon as we make visual contact, we'll uplink a real-time feed to your command. 
(quietly): Here. 
(over phone): Lives are at stake, Yassir. 
Get me that intel. 
Yes, sir. 
You okay? 
The truth? No, not really. 
Hey. 
We're going to get through this, okay? 
I hope so. 
Is there a problem, Chloe? 
Yeah. 
Are you going to tell us what it is? 
I was installing security upgrades, and I noticed you were using Milo's clearance code. 
Which, in case you didn't know, is a felony security breach. 
No, it must be a mistake. 
My system's been glitchy, and I think I... 
It's not a glitch, Milo. 
Nadia's been working with your user I.D. 
So unless she stole it, you gave it to her. 
Milo was just trying to help me do my work. 
Nadia... 
Homeland Security sent down an order restricting my security access because I was born in the Middle East. 
I've heard of that directive, and I think it's wrong for us to be racially profiling our own agents, but it's still a felony security breach for you to be using Milo's code. 
Chloe... 
If you report this, we can't help the situation if we're fired and arrested. 
If I wanted to report you, I wouldn't be talking to you. 
I'm telling you this so that you'll be careful. 
I mean, I noticed it. 
Someone else is going to notice it sooner or later. 
BUCHANAN: Nadia? 
Yes, sir. 
Morris has a satellite visual on Shadow Valley. 
It looks like the terrorists have launched a single drone. 
I'm conferencing with General Walsh now. 
I'll be right there, sir. 
Coordinate with first-responders in all target zones. 
Put General Walsh through. 
You're on with Bill Buchanan, sir. 
This is Walsh. 
BUCHANAN: General, we've made visual contact with a single drone. 
We're tracking it on satellite. 
It's heading on a northwest vector out of Shadow Valley. 
Altitude is 3,300 feet and climbing. 
Velocity is 360 miles an hour. 
I'm looking at the specs on the RQ-2 now. 
It's got a low-profile design, virtually impossible to detect by radar. 
We'll need to manually guide our F-16s to intercept. 
We're uplinking a video feed to you now. 
Have you determined its intended target? 
Yes. This is Nadia Yassir. 
The closest target is downtown Los Angeles. 
That's a four-minute window. 
Maximum airspeed of an RQ-2 is 400 miles per hour. 
My F-16s should be able to intercept it within two minutes. 
MORRIS: Um... 
that may be a problem. 
I can't find the drone. 
The drone's gone. 
How can it be gone? 
It was passing between grids, but when I switched satellites... 
Readjust based on projected vectors. 
I'm doing that now, General, it's just not where it's supposed to be. 
Until you find it, I'll have my F-16s stay in a holding pattern. 
(beeping) Yes? 
I've accessed our connection to CTU. 
I've disabled their tracking capability. 
Then they cannot detect the drone? 
No. And I'll be able 
to keep it hidden from their satellites until we've hit the target. 
Good. I'll contact you again 
once we are out of the area. 
Sir, I was just talking to Bill Buchanan at CTU. 
They were tracking one of the drones. 
They've now lost visual contact with it. 
Lost visual contact? 
Yeah, it's unclear just how, sir. 
They just simply can't find it. 
We have the most sophisticated satellite network in the world. 
How the hell did this happen? 
CTU is still trying to determine that, sir. 
What about the military? 
Well, they've got three squadrons looking for it, but these drones are invisible to radar, so the pilots are limited to making visual ID at night over hundreds of square miles. 
Now, CTU has a ranked list of potential targets. 
They're running civil disaster scenarios... 
Lisa? 
Sir? 
Advance the meeting with the Joint Chiefs. 
When do you want it to happen? 
Right away. 
Wait, sir. Why... 
Why are we assembling the Joint Chiefs? 
I warned the ambassador, Tom. 
You heard me tell him that I'd hold his country responsible if another nuclear weapon was detonated on our soil. 
Sir, there's absolutely no evidence that his country either sponsored these attacks or is even in support of them. 
His people need to understand that I'm not just rattling my saber. 
They need to see with their own eyes that I will answer this threat with an in-kind military response. 
Wait. 
"In kind," sir? 
I want the Joint Chiefs to draw up our own target list for a nuclear strike. 
At its rated speed, the drone should have reached Los Angeles, so we can eliminate us as a target. 
In the next few minutes, I can take Santa Barbara and San Diego off the list. 
How many targets does that leave within the drone's range? 
Counting cities with populations over a million... 
fifteen. 
We have to narrow it down. 
Assuming they want the maximum civilian death toll, how many likely targets within the drone's range? 
Areas with the highest population density are San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix. 
Confirm that NEST teams and First Responders have deployed in those cities. 
Morris, make sure the Air Force prioritizes their search on that basis. 
Yup. 
(gasps) Give me the projected coordinates. 
Bill. 
Bill, did we pick up Gredenko? 
We're working on it. 
Bill, what happened? 
Gredenko escaped. 
But not before launching one of the drones. 
How close is the Air Force to intercepting it? 
F-16s were minutes away, then the drone disappeared from the satellite grid; we're still looking for it. 
Jack. 
Get to medical. 
There's nothing you can do here. 
Just keep me informed, please. 
I will. 
Doyle, I want you to run point on the search for Fayed and Gredenko. 
Milo's monitoring from the Situation Room. 
I'll be right there. 
I'll see you over at Medical. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Could we have a moment, please? 
They said you were hurt. 
I'm, I'm fine. 
As soon as all of this is over, I'll come by and check on you and Josh. 
I always regretted things didn't work out between us... 
and... 
I always believed you did, too. 
Maybe I was wrong. 
No, you weren't. 
Listen, Marilyn, before I was taken prisoner by the Chinese... 
I, I was with someone. 
She doesn't even know I'm still alive, but... 
I need to talk to her... 
see what happens. 
Are you talking about Audrey Raines? 
Yeah. 
You don't know. 
Do you? 
(sighs) Jack, I'm... 
I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this... 
Audrey's dead. 
I don't know all the details, I just know what I read in the paper about her accident. 
What accident? When? 
It was a few months ago. 
It was a car accident. 
Somewhere in China. 
China. 
Excuse me. 
I'm sorry. 
I have to go. 
(panting) CHLOE: There'll be separate channels open for all First Responders in at-risk cities... 
All First Responders should coordi... 
Why the hell didn't anybody tell me about Audrey? 
Mr. Buchanan didn't want to tell 
you when you first got back, because we all thought Fayed was just going to kill you. 
But I probably should have. 
I'm sorry. 
She was in China looking for me? 
She was the one who figured out the Chinese had taken you. 
Apparently she spent the past year going through back channels, to try to get you out. 
The rest of it's classified by Division, I don't know any more. 
We were asked to send the DNA records, so that they could get a positive ID on the remains... 
which I guess they did. 
I want that file. 
All right, Jack. 
Now! 
I have to dig it up in archives. 
Just do it. 
The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs will be attending in person, the State will be monitoring via satellite. 
And the rest of the Cabinet will be provided with video transcripts. 
Good. 
You should also know that Karen Hayes will be attending. 
I thought I told you I wanted her excluded from this. 
She supported Wayne Palmer's policy of appeasement. 
She's going to be a problem. 
Well, there was nothing I could do. 
She's still acting National Security Advisor. 
But I've only given her current circumstances. 
Any objection to your plans will not be able to gain traction. 
(chuckles) Oh, I've known Karen Hayes for many years. 
It's always been a mistake to underestimate... 
her. 
Hello, Tom. 
Somebody push you down the stairs? 
No, Karen, I tripped over your ineptitude. 
On that subject, welcome back. 
Look, Tom, I don't want to play games. 
I won't let you blackmail me again. 
So you do what you need to do, I am here to represent the President, and I intend to stay. 
All right, fair enough. 
Karen. 
No one is sorrier than I am about what happened to Wayne. 
Well, at least we have that in common. 
Please be seated. 
As many of you are already aware, the terrorist who attacked us this morning, Abu Fayed, with the help of Dmitri Gredenko, has launched an aerial drone that we believe is armed with another nuclear bomb. 
Efforts are ongoing to locate this drone. 
But should those efforts fail, we are looking at a second nuclear attack on our country in less than ten hours. 
And I am determined not to let this attack happen without a military response on our part. 
A military response directed against whom, Mr. Vice 
President? 
We were under the impression that these terrorists were essentially stateless. 
Secretary Kanin, that is the fiction they hide behind. 
But... 
everyone in this room knows that elements within Abu Fayed's country train and fund terrorist organizations like his. 
It is time to hold them accountable. 
The Ambassador has just been informed that if the nuclear weapon on that drone detonates, we will retaliate with our own nuclear strike. 
Now this will be a warning shot, not a full-scale attack. 
The Joint Chiefs have been instructed to identify an unpopulated area where there will be limited civilian casualties. 
Admiral. 
The closest match we have  to that scenario is territory near their northern border. 
We believe this should result in fewer than 2,000 deaths. 
Long-term damage from radioactive fallout, however, could double that number, depending on ground conditions. 
I can accept that. 
Mr. Vice President, 
I'm sure you're aware that our intelligence suggests that their government can't control Fayed either. 
They are doing the best that they can. 
And I'm saying they need to figure out a way to do better. 
Something tells me that once this bomb hits, they will. 
If this bomb hits, the opposite will hold true. 
The moderates will be driven from power, the terrorists' position will be strengthened there and in the region, and I don't hear anyone talking about the Chinese or Russian response to this. 
We could start another world war. 
If I thought there was a high likelihood of that, I wouldn't be suggesting this. 
Mr. Vice President, 
the stakes are too high for this decision to be based on your personal judgment. 
It is my opinion that this course of action would be dangerous and reckless. 
Consider your concern registered, Karen. 
But the debate is over. 
America must start to stand up for herself. 
The attacks on this country must stop! 
And as acting Commander In Chief, I believe this is the best way to make that happen. 
Admiral, have a nuclear strike sub standing by. 
Nadia? 
I never got those SIM files you were gonna send me. 
Oh, yeah, your system was overloaded. 
So I gave them to Morris, he's going to take care of it for you. 
Morris? 
Yeah. 
I mean, you really think he can handle it? 
Well, he seems to be himself again. 
Is he himself because he had a drink and he smoothed out? 
I don't think so. 
Hey. 
What are you doing? 
Setting up a reverse data stream on the drone's satellite intel, okay? 
Morris seems better. 
Is that a question? 
Is he? 
Yes. 
Look, I need you to do me a favor. 
No. 
I need you to check his breathe. 
If he's better, great. 
If he had a drink and he's headed for another crash we need to know about that. 
Fine. 
Thanks, darling. 
What was that for? 
Just checking your breath. 
He's fine. 
Thank you. 
(typing) Got to love this place. 
HAYES: Tom. 
Tom. 
Yes, Karen, I hear you. 
You can't possibly be in favor of Daniels' plan for a nuclear strike. 
You heard the Vice President. 
It's a warning shot into an unpopulated area. 
It is a military offensive on foreign soil. 
And you and I both know it will be impossible to contain. 
Tom, you know this is insane, I know you do. 
I saw you in that meeting. 
I saw the doubt in your eyes. 
Do not presume to know what I am thinking or feeling. 
I serve at the discretion of those above me. 
You serve the interests of the President. 
And you know that Wayne would not sign off on this course of action. 
Wayne was wrong. 
Every decision he made today was wrong rejecting my security initiatives, using Assad as an appeal to extremist groups. 
And look what we've been led to! 
You can't seriously believe that. 
You just cannot! 
Doesn't matter what I believe. 
As long as the President is in a coma, Daniels is the acting Commander in Chief. 
Now, if you want him to abort that missile launch, you had better pray that CTU can find and stop that drone. 
We've got ground teams on all roads leading out of Shadow Valley looking for Fayed and Gredenko, but with SAT support dedicated to finding the drone, there's not much to go on. 
MILO: And CalTrans doesn't have any cameras set up in the outlying areas. 
Mr. Buchanan, we figured out 
how the drone is able to stay hidden from our satellites. 
Whoever is piloting it is able to anticipate our repositioning directives, flying through the gaps in the images. 
How can he do that? 
CHLOE: Our satellite data is being relayed to the drone pilot through a workstation here. 
We have a leak. 
One of our own people? 
Looks that way. 
Can you isolate the workstation? 
No. It's being masked 
through a sub-circuit. 
Morris is working on it now, but there are over 50 stations in this building. 
It could take an hour to do a signature trace. 
We don't have an hour. 
Run a trace match on Nadia Yassir's station. 
Why Nadia? 
Do it. 
MILO: Wait, you think just because she's a Muslim, that gives you the right... 
I'm following standard protocol. 
Standard protocol? 
She's already been tagged and given restricted clearance. 
(scoffs) And, yeah, she is a Muslim. 
That's enough to go on. 
Everyone here is thinking it, even if they won't say it. 
You're a racist. 
BUCHANAN: Milo, I understand your distaste. 
But we have to vet every system in the building. 
There's no reason not to start with hers. 
No, sir, there's every reason. 
Nadia Yassir's 100 percent loyal to this country. 
She is not a terrorist. 
Is this assessment based on some private knowledge? 
Or is it because you're itching to sleep with her? 
Son of a... 
BUCHANAN: All right! 
That's enough! 
Agent Doyle, that was way out of line. 
We don't have time for your personal differences. 
We have to find out who's subverting our system. 
It is Nadia. 
The signature trace matches her computer. 
Shut down her workstation. 
CHLOE: I'm trying. The only way to cut 
the data flow is to reboot CTU's mainframe. 
We'd be without system power for more than 20 minutes. 
Get security on the floor now. 
Surrender your station. 
Excuse me? 
Who are you streaming our satellite data to? 
What?! 
Where is the pilot? 
BUCHANAN: Doyle, damn it, that's enough! 
Take her to holding. 
Bill, don't let, don't let him do this! 
What are you doing?! 
Bill, I'm innocent! 
I'm not a traitor! 
Morris, secure her station. 
See if you can run a back trace on that leak. 
Find out where the feed is going. 
Excuse me. 
Victor. 
What is the drone's current position? 
130 miles southeast of target. 
Have you locked in the GPS coordinates? 
Yes. 
The bomb will detonate over San Francisco within 20 minutes. 
WELTON: ...you want the drip 
to stay steady. 
Add in some glucose after about an hour. 
If you see anything, any movement, twitch of the eyelids, you get me. 
Got it? 
Dr. Welton, 
I need to speak with you. 
I don't have much time, Ms. Hayes. 
What's the President's condition? 
It's worsened in the last 15 minutes. 
There was a buildup of intracranial pressure. 
We had to induce a coma to relieve the swelling. 
I see. 
Good news is we stopped it in time. 
Doesn't seem to have been any neural damage, and his vitals are surprisingly strong. 
He's a fighter. 
We have that much going for us. 
Excuse me. 
Doctor... 
Yes. 
Is there any way that you can bring the President back to consciousness? 
I know this is an unusual request, but it's a matter of national security that I speak with him. 
I'm sorry. 
It could pose a serious risk to his life. 
I couldn't possibly authorize it. 
Who could? 
I'd need consent from his family. 
His sister is here. 
But I would strongly advise against it. 
If the swelling isn't contained, the President could suffer permanent brain damage. 
I have to go, Ms. Hayes. 
* * This is insane. 
Nadia can't be involved in this. 
The signal was routed through her station. 
We can't ignore that fact. 
Do you really believe that Nadia is helping the terrorists? 
I don't want to believe it, but I really don't know. 
Doyle's an ass. 
He's doing his job. 
If we want him to stop, we have to prove she's innocent. 
Hello. Think I 
got something. 
What is it? 
I've set up a feedback pulse. 
Whoever Nadia's feeding our data stream to will read it as some static in the line, but we may be able to ride the pulse back to its source, find the location of the drone pilot. 
I've got it. 
1530 Hillcrest. 
Hillcrest, that's close. 
Bloody close three blocks away. 
Okay, tell Buchanan. 
I'm asking you once again, cooperate. 
Help me put an end to this. 
(sighs) (gasps) I'm warning you. 
I will do what's necessary to get the answers I need. 
Do you understand? 
Do you understand? 
(gasping) I understand everything. 
I read your file. 
I know what you did in Denver. 
You enjoy hurting people. 
You get off on it. 
We're not here to talk about me. 
We're here to talk about what you know. 
I don't know anything! 
MILO: Get away from her, Doyle. 
I said let her go. 
What the hell are you doing? 
We got the drone pilot's location through Nadia's computer. 
Where is it? 
Three blocks from here. 
1530 Hillcrest. 
We're not through with her, Milo. 
(gasps) Are you okay? 
Milo? 
You know I didn't have anything to do with this. 
Get out of here. 
* * Agent, what's going on? 
We have a location on the drone's pilot. 
We're mobilizing now. 
BUCHANAN: As you know, whoever's piloting the drone is operating in close proximity to CTU. 
I'm instituting a level one security lock-down. 
All provisional safeguards are in effect until further notice. 
Let's go to work! 
Marcy... 
contact LAPD. 
Have them coordinate with tactical. 
Seal off a perimeter. 
Yes, sir. 
Chloe... 
have they confirmed the address? 
Yes, it's a relay station. 
I've got the building specs and layout. 
I'm gonna need a PDA and a phone. 
I'll get them for you. 
Thanks. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
I'm going with the team. 
You're injured. 
You should be in medical. 
You should have told me about Audrey, Bill. 
We were asking you to give your life, Jack. 
I didn't think it was right to tell you about Audrey's accident. 
It wasn't an accident. 
She was murdered. 
No one knows that for sure. 
I do. 
Bill, Audrey gave her life trying to get me out of a Chinese prison because she thought I was worth it. 
I'm not going to let her die for nothing now. 
I'm going to finish this. 
And when I do, I'm gonna track down the people responsible for her murder, and I'm going to take care of them, too. 
Please, you have to let me finish this. 
All right. 
I'll tell Doyle you're running point. 
The drone is approaching the city. 
I'm beginning descent now. 
How long until the bomb detonates? 
At its current speed, the drone will reach the target perimeter within three minutes. 
It will detonate automatically when it reaches the perimeter line. 
I'll bring it in at an altitude of 500 feet to achieve maximum damage. 
Don't worry, tovarish, everything is set. 
It will happen exactly as you planned. 
Concentrate on the task at hand. 
Then call me when it's done. 
Yes, sir. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
We're in position. 
The gate was open, there's a utility truck parked behind the building. 
Our back-trace shows the intrusion into our system is coming from a room in the northwest corner of the switching station. 
Jack, I'm looking at an updated schematic now. Your most direct  
route is through the rear entrance, to the left. 
Okay. Did you get that? 
Yeah. 
(grunts) Do you want me on point? 
I got it. 
Let's go. 
Whatever you say. 
(clattering) What was that? 
Go check. 
(gunshot, groaning) Let's get a medic. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Do you copy? 
We copy. 
Jack, what's your status? 
The drone pilot is down. 
I'm at his controls now. 
The target is San Francisco. 
I repeat, the target is San Francisco. 
Alert local law enforcement and First Responders in the area, and open a channel with the Regional Control Center up there. 
Got it. 
These controls are for navigation only. 
There is no way to deactivate the bomb remotely. 
CTU, we're linking you in now. 
You should have it. 
It's coming through. 
Jack, is there any way for you to determine what triggering mechanism they're using? 
It looks like they wired a GPS module into the bomb. 
It'll detonate as soon as it crosses its designated perimeter. 
I'm trying to steer it away now. 
Don't turn the drone too sharply, or it'll stall, and you'll lose control. 
Copy that. 
On its current course, the drone will cross the perimeter and detonate in 30 seconds. 
Jack, you're getting a stabilizer warning. 
I see it. 
20 seconds. 
Ten seconds. 
Okay, it's turning. 
The drone did not cross the perimeter. 
I'm fighting a stall. 
I'm losing control of the drone. 
I need to find a place to land it now. 
All right, according to the specs, it's gonna need 500 feet of runway to land. 
Okay, closest to the drone's current position, there's a long stretch of residential road straight ahead of you. 
That's a negative. Find me 
an area that's unpopulated. 
Hold on. 
If you can get the drone farther east, there's an industrial park along the Bay. 
I'm uploading the coordinates now. 
Have Regional Command deploy units to the area immediately. 
Regional Command... 
Come on. 
(engine whooshing) The drone is down. 
(clanking) MORRIS: Mr. Buchanan, 
none of the First Responders in San Francisco are reporting a detonation. 
The bomb did not go off on impact. 
Jack, did you copy that? 
Yeah. 
Can we get a visual from anyone at the site? 
I'm showing a fire and rescue unit already arriving at the scene. 
What's the status on the pilot? 
He's alive, barely. 
Do whatever you have to to get him conscious. 
(sirens blaring) (indistinct radio transmission) (beeping) Get the Geiger counter. 
(beeping continues) (static crackling) (crackling continues, then ceases) Move out! There's radioactive 
material in this area! 
Pull back and wait for HAZMAT. 
Move it! 
Sir, I have Bill Buchanan on line one. 
Bill, what do you have? 
Mr. Vice President, 
the drone was intercepted before the nuclear bomb was able to detonate. 
Oh, thank God. 
Congratulations, sir. 
We were able to take control of the aircraft, crash-landing it in an industrial park at the edge of the city. 
But in the process, the bomb's nuclear core was compromised, and radioactive material was released. 
So what we're essentially dealing with is a dirty bomb. 
Sir, this was not a dispersal device. 
It was a radiological spill. 
It was an attack on our nation. 
Bill, are there casualties? 
Local Responders got there before HAZMAT. 
They were almost certainly exposed to fatal doses of radiation, but so far, it appears that radioactive material was not widely dispersed. 
Casualties should be minimal. 
At least we've got that to be grateful for. Thanks, Bill. 
Proceed with the warning strike as planned. 
Sir, the primary attack was averted. 
CTU was successful. 
There will be civilian deaths, as well as untold environmental damage. 
I hardly consider that a success. 
The damage will be minimal compared to what we just avoided. 
Sir, I think we should consider ourselves fortunate. 
Tom? 
Sir? 
Mr. Vice President, 
we were led to believe that this warning shot would be fired only in response to the detonation of a nuclear device. 
That is a technicality, Tom. 
I gave fair warning to the Prime Minister, and I intend to carry it out. 
Secretary Kanin? 
How long will it take to move the submarine into position? 
Once you've given the order... 
within the hour. 
The order is given. 
Launch the missile... 
...as soon as they're in range. 
=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents Yeah. 
Mark Hauser? 
Who's this? 
You know who it is. 
MARK:  I already gave you  what you asked for. 
But your employer has tightened security, so the access I paid for is no good. 
It'll take some time to download the new security protocols. 
I'll give them 40 minutes. 
Federal agent! 
Down on the floor! 
 Bill, Hauser admitted  to selling Gredenko the security specs for Edgemont nuclear power facility. 
Does Gredenko have the specs? 
Not yet. He's going to pick 
them up in about 20 minutes. 
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother that Gredenko knows. 
We're going to use him  to go through  with the transaction. 
You look nervous, Brady. 
All teams, take out your targets. 
There's a third hostile inside the vehicle! 
You know who I am and you know what I'm going to do to you unless you tell me where the bombs are. 
First my terms: amnesty from your government and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia. 
Nadia's being processed as an enemy combatant. 
I don't know if I can accept that she betrayed us. 
She spied for Fayed? 
 I think we're wrong. 
I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends. 
Yeah. Why do you ask? 
'Cause I came across evidence at the switching station that proves Nadia's innocent. 
You're clear, Nadia. 
Admiral Smith, is the Vickery ready to launch? 
It's seconds from optimal launch position, Mr. Vice President. 
Good, proceed with the strike. 
HAYES: Vice President Daniels is about to launch a nuclear strike against the Middle East. 
This strike is a complete reversal of everything your brother was working for. 
You want Dr. Welton 
to bring him out of the coma. 
Yes. 
(phone rings) It's for you, sir. 
Yes. 
I've called off the strike, Noah. 
I'm resuming my duties as Commander in Chief. 
Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's to be no hostile action without my direct authorization. 
It's apparent to me that the president is still suffering the effects from the attack on his life. 
I can't let him remain in power. 
Get me the Attorney General. 
LENNOX: Secretary Dawes, can you see and hear me clearly? 
Yes, I can. 
What about Secretary Durant and Attorney General Graves? 
Their connections are being set up now. 
How about the president? 
He should be arriving any moment. 
What are you doing? 
I need to get up from this wheelchair. 
No, you need to take care of yourself. 
Sandra, I can't afford to look weak. 
Roosevelt did just fine from a wheelchair. 
Listen, when I face Daniels, I want to be on my feet. 
Dr. Welton? 
Yes, sir? 
Can you give me a shot of adrenaline? 
Wayne. 
I can. 
It'll raise your blood pressure, which is not what you need right now. 
Could elevate the risk... 
(knocking) Mr. President, 
it is time. 
Give us a few minutes, please. 
Yes, sir. 
Excuse me, Mr. President. 
Mr. President... 
Just do it. 
Now. 
(phone beeps) What do you have, Jack? 
Gredenko offered us Fayed in exchange for immunity and a guarantee that we won't extradite him back to Russia. 
Bill, I don't trust him. 
He rolled over too easy. 
What do you think his play is? 
I don't know yet. 
Well, it's your call, Jack. 
But you should know what's happening in Washington. 
President Palmer's regained consciousness. 
How is he? 
Well enough to reassert his claim on the presidency. 
but Daniels is challenging him under the 25th amendment in large part so he can go ahead with the nuclear strike against Fayed's country. 
Does he have a chance of winning? 
It's unclear, but if Fayed detonates another bomb, no one will be able to stand in Daniels' way. 
If there's a challenge for the presidency, the immunity agreement will have no authority. 
It won't be binding. 
Bill, you need to understand that I have no intention of honoring this agreement. 
Tell the Attorney General, fill out the papers. 
I'm calling him right now. 
The president should be here momentarily. 
Mr. President. 
Mr. President. 
Mr. President, 
I know I speak for everyone here in saying how very happy I am to have you with us again. 
Let's proceed. 
(Lennox clears throat) LENNOX: As you know, an attempt was made to assassinate the president. 
He sustained injuries so serious that the doctors had to induce a temporary coma in order to relieve the pressure on his brain. 
In so doing, they saved his life. 
The question now is whether, in the words of the 25th amendment, he is unable to discharge the duties and powers of his office. 
Mr. Lennox, 
isn't this really a medical question? 
Well, to a degree it is, but the 25th amendment puts the final decision squarely in the hands of the Cabinet. 
May we hear medical testimony? 
Yes, we may. 
And to that end, let me bring in the surgeon in charge of the president's case. 
Dr. Welton, 
if you would, please. 
The president has undergone an ordeal, but from a medical point of view, I believe the greatest danger is passed. 
His cognitive functions are presenting normally. 
I have every expectation that President Palmer will make a full recovery. 
GILES: Might the pressures of the office increase the possibility of a relapse? 
It's difficult to say. 
It's certainly a possibility. 
Can you estimate those chances? 
I'm afraid I can't. 
If you had a vote, Doctor, how would you cast it? 
This is precisely the question which the Constitution demands that this Cabinet answer. 
Thank you very much, Doctor. 
Uh, Mr. President, I think now 
would be an appropriate time to address the Cabinet, if you would, please. 
The vice president initiated this process because I stopped him from launching a nuclear strike against the Middle East. 
But this vote shouldn't be about policy. 
According to the Constitution, you're judging me to see if I am unable to discharge the duties of my office. 
Well, as you can see, and as you were just told by my physician, I'm in complete possession of my faculties, and so to remove me from this office would be to betray both your oath and the American people who voted me as their president. 
All right, Mr. Vice President. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet, the 25th amendment is purposely vague on how you're supposed to judge if a president is unable to discharge his duties. 
It's open to interpretation, which is why this is very much about the president's policies and his actions. 
Here are the facts: When a second nuclear attack today spread radiation over one of our major cities, I decided it was necessary to launch a retaliatory strike to show our enemies that if attacked, we would make them share our pain. 
Wayne Palmer's first act upon regaining consciousness was to stop that strike; to respond to the attack by doing nothing. 
In a time of war, the president must be strong enough in body and mind to defend this country. 
And I'm afraid Wayne Palmer's actions are the proof in this matter that indeed, he is unable to discharge his duties. 
All right, time is of the essence, so unless there's an objection, I would like to recess and then reconvene for your vote in ten minutes. 
Any word on the Cabinet vote? 
No, they haven't come back yet. 
Look, Milo, about what happened today, let's just put it behind us, okay? 
Oh, which part, the suspicion of terrorism or the... the other thing? 
The suspicion. 
And the other thing? 
Let's not worry about it right now. 
Let's try and get through the day. 
Okay. 
I'm not going to forget about the kiss, and I don't think you are, either. 
(phone rings) Nadia. 
Nadia, it's Doyle. 
Don't say my name, just listen. 
All right. 
Okay. I need you to come up 
to my office right now and don't say anything to anybody, just come. 
On my way. 
(sighs) Have a seat. 
Look, I know you and I got off to kind of a bad start. 
A bad start? 
You assaulted me. 
This country is under attack by Islamic terrorists. 
We had reason to believe there was a mole in this building. 
Starting with you wasn't racist. 
It was common sense. 
Oh, okay, so you're not a racist, you're just a sadist. 
You don't know me. 
I think I do. 
Why'd you call me here? 
It turns out there was no mole. 
The terrorists were able to hack into our system 'cause someone screwed up and logged the wrong security parameters. 
I'm pretty sure that someone was Milo, and the proof is on his computer. 
I need someone to get it without him noticing. 
I can't do that. 
Why? Is it 'cause 
you're too busy deciding if you want to sleep with him? 
Listen, if you don't get the evidence for me, I'm going to call a forensics team, and they're going to come and tear his system apart as the entire floor watches. 
And if they find what I think they're going to find, everyone gets to watch Milo hauled out of this building in handcuffs. 
I'm sure it wasn't pleasant when it happened to you. 
But you're going to stand by and watch it happen to him? 
That's your idea of being a friend. 
So you want me to betray him for his own good. 
I promise you, Milo will be better off if you help me than if you don't. 
Your call. 
If the Cabinet sides with you, what are you going to do about Daniels? 
Unfortunately, Karen, the Constitution doesn't allow the president to fire his vice president. 
No, but you can marginalize him. 
Karen's right. 
Get him out of the bunker. 
I would love to, but Daniels has way too many supporters, and I can't afford to alienate any one of them right now. 
Besides, I'd rather have him somewhere where I can keep an eye on him. 
Mr. President, 
the Cabinet's reconvening. 
Thank you. 
HAYES: All right, let's go. 
Please, sit. 
All right, ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet, let us now begin the vote. 
Will those of you who believe that President Palmer is able to discharge his duties please, at this time, raise your hand. 
Do we have any abstentions? 
Uh, the vote is seven to seven. 
LENNOX: Mr. Attorney General, 
what would be the next step? 
Well, there's no need for a next step. 
The amendment requires that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet agree. 
There is no majority in the Cabinet. 
It's split evenly. 
President Palmer remains in office. 
NOAH: It's not that simple one of the Cabinet votes is invalid. 
LENNOX: Uh... sir, 
wh-which vote is not valid? 
National Security Advisor. 
What are you talking about? 
She resigned. 
I resumed my duties. 
I don't agree. 
And I haven't seen any evidence that you've been reinstated. 
That is ridiculous! 
I sat here with you in a Cabinet meeting less than one hour ago! 
Ms. Hayes, 
allowing you to sit in on the meeting isn't the equivalent of formally recognizing you as National Security Advisor. 
In fact, I did not and do not so recognize you. 
Oh, my God! 
And if Ms. Hayes' 
vote is invalid, then the tally's seven to six in favor of invoking the 25th amendment and removing... 
President Palmer from power. 
I'm sorry, Wayne. 
Noah, don't waste your apologies on me, because I won't let you steal the presidency. 
That's just not going to happen. 
And what do you suggest? 
The country has to be governed. 
LENNOX: Well, I would suggest, sir, that this is properly a matter for the courts. 
I concur. 
We don't have time to go to... 
GRAVES: Mr. Vice President, if I may. 
I agree with Mr. Lennox 
this is a legal question. 
The Supreme Court was in session this afternoon. 
We can recall it and have them render a decision regarding the validity of the vote. 
The whole matter could be resolved in well under an hour. 
Well, thank you, Attorney General Graves. 
Why don't you simply get the process started, and keep us advised of your progress. 
Certainly. 
I think this meeting is concluded. 
(quietly): Get my affidavit started. 
Tom. 
You know something? 
I'm beginning to think you're not on my side. 
Well, sir, I'm on the side of the United States of America, and if you ever thought otherwise, you were very much mistaken. 
Gredenko's attorney approved the immunity agreements. 
Yeah, we're just waiting for digital signatures. 
All right. 
I'll inform the attorney general's office it's on its way. 
Thank you. 
Milo. 
What's up? 
I'm having a problem with my station it keeps telling me to refresh the system credentials. 
Uh, it's the hardware codes. 
You have to reset them in the machine room. 
I can take care of it. 
Thanks. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
(laughs softly) Well, you were right. 
Milo forgot to refresh the security parameters. 
The breach was his fault. 
So when you tell District, they can fire and maybe even arrest him. 
Which is why I'm going to alter the logs so they'll never know. 
(sighs): This should work, as long as they haven't changed the password. 
(beep) There. It's done. 
Why'd you do that? 
'Cause all I care about is finding those nukes, and we have a better chance of doing that with Milo on board, whether he likes me or not. 
"And mankind was naught by a single nation." 
You've read the Koran. 
Yeah, and the Bible and the Upanishads. 
Anything I can get my hands on. 
You're lucky you found your answers. 
I'm looking for mine. 
I'm going to get ready to deploy. 
What did Doyle want? 
Nothing. We were just 
reviewing some data sets. 
Oh, your... system's back up. 
Thanks. 
(phone rings) Buchanan. 
HAYES: Hi. It's me. 
Hey, how did the Cabinet vote go? 
It was a tie, which, in effect, means that Palmer's still in office. 
Good, that's good. 
That's what we wanted. 
Yes, well, Daniels is contesting the vote. 
He's saying that mine is invalid. 
Based on what? 
Based on the fact that I resigned, and I was never officially reinstated. 
That's ridiculous. 
You attended Cabinet meetings; you had no replacement assigned. 
How does he explain that? 
I know, but maybe he's right, Bill. 
I did hand in my resignation. 
Which was rescinded before it was officially accepted. 
Daniels knows that. 
He's grasping at straws, Karen. 
I'm so scared, Bill. 
If he wins... 
this will all be my fault. 
Stop, stop. 
It's desperate maneuvering on his part, Karen, nothing more. 
He hasn't got a case. 
And the Supreme Court will agree. 
Well, we're giving our arguments in 15 minutes. 
Call me as soon as the decision is in. 
Thank you for being there. 
You don't have to thank me. 
It's my job. 
(laughs) I miss you so much. 
I miss you, too. 
I'll talk to you soon. 
Bye. 
(long sigh) (Gredenko speaking Russian) (man speaks Russian over phone)  Dasvidanya. 
(snaps cell phone shut) Good. My attorney 
has verified the agreements. 
Bill, we're set. 
Gredenko's ready to make the call. 
All right, Jack, we're standing by. 
Doyle's got a team ready to go as soon as Fayed tells Gredenko where to meet him. 
Copy that. 
You try and warn Fayed with anything you say or how you say it, and I will kill you right here right now. 
I believe you, Agent Bauer. 
Make the call. 
(phone rings) Yes? 
It's me. 
Do you have the security protocols for the power plant? 
Yes. 
Where do you want to meet? 
Are you certain you're not under surveillance? 
Of course. 
Do you think I'd be calling you otherwise? 
I can't allow another one of your mistakes to disrupt my plans for the remaining two devices. 
Do you want the protocols or not? 
Where are you right now? 
Culver City. 
Meet me at the Santa Monica Pier in ten minutes. 
GREDENKO: Um, it may take me more time. 
I won't wait. 
Where do I find you? 
Just be there. 
I'll find you. 
Give him the phone. 
Bill, how long will it take Doyle's team to make it to the pier? 
He's about 30 minutes out, Jack. 
We'll make due with Ryan's team. 
Put him in the vehicle. 
Instructions from the Supreme Court. 
Our arguments have to be submitted in writing, in the next ten minutes. 
Sandra's working on our brief. 
How's it coming? 
I'm just about finished. 
We have a strong case. 
You resigned, and Daniels was in charge when you returned, so the legal question is, did he consent to your reinstatement? 
Of course he did. 
And he made no objections when you returned to the bunker, you sat in his first Cabinet meeting, and he never questioned your right to be there? 
No, he didn't. 
His own actions prove our case. 
Thank you... 
for everything, Sandra. 
My affidavit explains everything that I never really intended to reinstate Karen, I was only allowing her to perform her duties temporarily, therefore, she had no authority to cast a vote under the 25th amendment. 
The problem is, after Karen returned, you treated her as if she were still National Security Advisor. 
It's really a question of my state of mind, though, isn't it? 
Yes. And your state of mind 
will be inferred from your actions. 
Doesn't sounds like you think our chances are very good. 
I don't. 
Then I am... deeply afraid 
for our country. 
When the world sees that Wayne Palmer isn't willing to fight back, our enemies will be encouraged. 
These recent attacks will be just the beginning. 
America will be vulnerable in a way it never has been. 
There may be a way to illuminate your state of mind more explicitly. 
I can swear an affidavit that, earlier today, you told me to inform Karen Hayes you had no intention of reinstating her. 
But that you were going to allow her to perform her duties on a temporary basis only. 
Then Wayne regained consciousness before I could have that conversation with her. 
Lisa, you're talking about perjuring yourself in front of the Supreme Court. 
I'm aware that it's perjury, but the end justifies the means. 
My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favor so that you can do what's right for this country. 
You're right. 
Do it. 
Prepare your affidavit. 
And, Lisa... 
...thank you. 
Yes, sir. 
Kasim, Hassan, with me. 
I'm meeting Gredenko. 
I'll be back within the hour. 
And if you're not? 
Are you worried for me, Halil, or just anxious to take my place? 
I think we're wasting time. 
We have the bombs. 
We should use them right now. 
Gredenko's information  will enable us to inflict damage across half of California. 
There's other target out there that will result in large amount of casualties without the additional risk. 
I've made my decision. 
Let's go. 
Come in. 
Mr. Vice President, 
I need to speak with you alone. 
There is something in this room you need to know about, sir. 
Something in this room? 
What are you talking about? 
This small object here is a microtransmitter. 
After you directed me to lie to the ambassador about the attempted assassination, I decided it was time to protect myself. 
Now it turns out I was protecting the country as well. 
Be careful, Tom. 
Be very careful what you try to do here. 
Actually, sir, you are the one who needs to be careful here. 
LISA: I'm aware that it's perjury, but the end justifies the means. 
My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favor so that you can do what's right for this country. 
NOAH: You're right. 
Do it. 
Prepare your affidavit. 
Turn it off. 
As I'm sure you're aware, sir, conspiracy to commit perjury is a felony offense. 
Now, I strongly urge you to pick up that phone and call the Supreme Court and tell them that you have withdrawn your affidavit, and that of Ms. Miller as well. 
Tell them that you support the vote of the Cabinet. 
That you have no further objections to President Palmer continuing his presidency. 
You do understand that I'm just trying to do what's right for this country. 
Well, so am I, sir. 
Karen, I need the launch protocols the Joint Chiefs set up with Vice President Daniels along with chain of command signing. 
They just came over from the Pentagon. 
Everything is in place. 
If the court sides with you, you can cancel the strike permanently. 
I also need want an update on the situation with Fayed. 
(hoarsely): Has CTU made any progress? 
Yes, they have Gredenko in custody. 
The last time I talked to Bill, they said they were going to use him to lure Fayed out in the open. 
Who's running it? 
Jack Bauer. 
Good. 
SANDRA: Wayne. 
The Supreme Court was just notified Daniels withdrew his suit. 
What? 
It's over. 
He gave up before the court had a chance to make its decision. 
Why? 
I don't know. 
I just know that you're still the President of the United States. 
(breathing heavily) Let the Cabinet know I won't take any action  against those who sided with the vice president. 
Yes, sir. 
Oh, and, Karen, tell Bill I want him to keep me up to date on CTU's progress. 
(breathing heavily) Melinda. 
Tell Dr. Welton I need 
to see him, please. 
I don't have a visual yet, but Fayed won't show himself until he sees Gredenko. 
BUCHANAN: Understood. Ryan, 
what's your status with Gredenko? 
RYAN: I've got the audio transmitter set up. 
I'm preparing the tracker now. 
Roll up your left sleeve. 
JACK: What's its range? 
We can track the isotope's signature up to 15 miles. 
Copy that. 
(winces) Is it radioactive? 
Yes. 
It penetrates into the bone. 
It's got a half-life of about 11 hours, so you can forget about trying to dig it out or making a run for it. 
He's good to go. 
JACK: Bill. 
How far out is Doyle's team? 
About 20 minutes. 
We can't wait. 
Fayed was clear about his timeline. 
Ryan, send in Gredenko. 
Gredenko's moving now. 
CHLOE: I'm getting a clean audio signal from the transmitter on Gredenko. 
And we are locked on the isotope signature that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm. 
(phone ringing) Hello. 
Hello? 
I have the gain on Gredenko's transmitter up all the way. 
There's no one on the other end of the call. 
He's reading something off his phone. 
It's a text message. 
Fayed's made contact. 
Everyone get ready. 
Gredenko is heading south. 
Milo, have you got him on the tracker? 
Yeah, he's still moving. 
I'm heading in. 
I'm going to follow him. 
* * I've lost audio signal. 
I'm going to secondary channel. 
There's no audio on the secondary channel. 
But he hasn't moved. 
I don't like it. 
Something's wrong. 
You led them to me. 
I had no choice. 
But if you listen to me, we'll both get away from here alive. 
Kasim. 
Which direction, Milo? 
I'm nearing the south end of the pier. 
That's where he stopped and entered the building on the left. 
Is he still inside the room? 
Yes, he's right on the other side of the door. 
I'm going in. 
Milo, no one's in here. 
Jack! The tracker's 
showing the signal right there in the same room with you. 
My God. 
He cut off Gredenko's arm. 
Ryan, move your men in now! 
RYAN: Roger that. Let's go. 
Hold on. 
I've picked up his blood trail. 
Fayed, their men will be coming from the west side parking lot. 
We should go this way. 
Ryan, have your men circle back to the east side of the pier. 
Try and cut them off. 
Ryan, have you got anything? 
Negative. 
How far out is Doyle's team? 
20 minutes. 
Have him set up a perimeter as soon as he gets here. 
Ryan, where are you?! 
I'm pinned down! 
Moving towards you now. 
Show me your head. 
TV REPORTER: But sources indicate that the same terrorist cell is most likely responsible for the nuclear explosion in Valencia... 
We're trapped. 
This way. 
That's him. 
I recognize him from the news. 
He's the terrorist they're looking for. 
MAN: That is him. 
You bastard. 
Federal agent! 
(two gunshots) I am a federal agent! 
I'm taking this man into custody. 
Now, back off! 
Back off! 
He shot my friend. 
I'm sorry about your friend. 
We'll get him medical attention. 
Just stay back. 
I hope your friend is dead. 
Shut up! 
Everybody out of the bar now! 
Move! 
Gredenko is not here. 
I need you to lock down the area and initiate a search. 
We have two men down. 
One is a civilian, the other is Fayed. He's in custody. 
I need Medical up here now. 
All right, Jack. Good work. 
Nadia, get me the president, please. 
I understand you're weak. 
Another dose of adrenaline will raise your blood pressure levels even higher, to the point where we know there'll be vascular damage. 
And that's a risk I'm willing to take. 
Your well-being is my responsibility. 
And my responsibility, Doctor, is to the well-being of this country. 
So give me another dose so I can go back to doing my job or I will find someone else who will. 
MELINDA: Mr. President, 
Bill Buchanan is on line one. 
I'll take it. 
Thank you, Arthur. 
Yes, sir. 
Bill. 
Mr. President, I'm calling 
to tell you that Jack has Fayed in custody. 
What about the bombs? 
We haven't finished the radiological scan yet, so we can't confirm the bombs are in the immediate vicinity. 
Jack is going to interrogate Fayed as soon as possible. 
But there's no way of knowing how long that will take or how successful that will be, right? 
No, sir. 
All right, Bill. 
That's what I wanted to know. 
Thank you, sir. 
But since the case was withdrawn, the court has no reason to retain the documents. 
They should be sealed and returned to me immediately. 
Okay. Good. Thank you. 
I was thinking that maybe it's time to declare a truce. 
Okay. Well... maybe it is. 
You know, we both want the same thing for this country what's good for the country. 
We just don't always agree on the means. 
I would love to go forward without the threats and the intimidation. 
Done. 
Good. 
One more thing. 
Do you know why the vice president withdrew his suit from the Supreme Court? 
No. I have no idea. Why? 
Well, one of my aides saw you with him before it was announced. 
I... I guess just put this down 
to happy coincidence. 
For now. 
But someday I'd love to know the realstory. 
Okay. Some day. 
(phone rings) Lennox. 
He... 
This cannot be, this has got to be some mistake. 
I'm on my way. 
President Palmer. 
What? 
He's about to go ahead with the nuclear strike. 
Mr. President. 
If I may, sir. 
I understand you're about to launch the very strike we just prevented Vice President Daniels from launching. 
That's right. 
This makes no sense, sir. 
I mean it's what you risked your life to stop. 
Tom, I risked my life to reassert my authority. 
I've got Vice President Daniels calling me weak. 
Even you thought the same thing. 
I implore you, sir, do not mistake being reckless with being strong. 
Tom, I am done talking. 
Mr. President. 
We have a successful launch. 
Good. 
=TLF SUB TEAM= http://tlfsub.eastgame.net 
JACK: That's hyocine-pentothal. 
You will experience a pain I can't even describe. 
At 8cc's, I run the risk of inducing heart attack. 
Four cc's! 
That's 8cc's total, Jack. 
His vitals are spiking across the line. 
Four cc's! 
(screaming) The connection you found between Dad and Gredenko had to do with a contract that was awarded to us. 
What did an ex-Russian general have to do with the contract? 
It was his job to release the old nukes... 
into the U.S. 
for decommissioning. 
He knows you didn't tell him everything. 
Yeah, and I won't. 
You know I won't, Dad. 
Have to be sure. 
(muffled grunting) (muffled screaming) I would like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere to come forward with any information regarding Fayed. 
I certainly can't reach out to them for help, but I know you can. 
Fayed has already called me a traitor. 
And many others will follow him if there is even a suspicion that I am an American puppet! 
Not a puppet, a partner. 
At least when it comes to finding these nuclear weapons. 
The President just rejected every one of my proposals. 
REED: A change in leadership is imperative to ensure this nation's security. 
I'm not talking about holding hearings. 
Something more... immediate 
would have to happen. 
This is the engineer? 
You've got the wrong man. 
(grunts) FAYED: You're going to modify this so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs. 
You will do it. 
The question is how much pain will be inflicted on you before you comply. 
(Morris screaming) (gasping, screaming) Stop! 
I'll do it. 
Arm it. 
Very good. 
(pumps shotgun) TURNER: Fayed's already gone. 
The reprogramming device that Fayed had me build for him, if it's not here, it means he took it with him. 
And with it, he can activate the other bombs he has anytime he wants. 
(helicopter rotors whirring) * * (phone ringing) Yes? 
FAYED: I have the arming device. 
But I had to leave one of the suitcases behind. 
What happened? 
CTU found me. 
I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape. 
The delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high-priority targets. 
Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three. 
More than enough for our needs, Gredenko. 
You just make sure the delivery system arrives on schedule. 
The trucks have left Nevada, and they'll reach the location within two hours. 
Good. 
You can use the time you have to reprogram your targeting software. 
Call me when it's completed. 
(vehicle engine starts) Since the FAA was unable to track Fayed's chopper, we have to assume it set down somewhere outside the containment area. 
We may not know where Fayed is, but we do know he's in possession of a device that will enable him to activate the three remaining suitcase nukes in his arsenal. 
Our only potential lead was uploaded from the hard drive of a laptop recovered at the scene by Jack Bauer and his team. 
Milo. 
There was an e-mail fragment I was able to restore from the computer's hard drive; it made reference to recent communications between Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko. 
Gredenko is the former Soviet general in charge of turning over Russian nukes to the U.S. for decommission. 
Ultimately, he was the source of the weapons Fayed now possesses. 
So, clearly, Gredenko's more involved in this than we realized. 
What's his interest in helping Fayed? 
Gredenko's an ultranationalist. 
His desire to harm this country, economically and otherwise, Have we gotten any updated intel on his location? 
BUCHANAN: Interpol just confirmed he's no longer in Moscow. 
Since the point of origin fingerprint on the e-mail fragment was Pacific time, I think it's safe to assume he's somewhere on the West Coast, possibly Los Angeles. 
Chloe, run a data sweep through INS and customs channels. 
See if we can track how he got in the country. 
(sighs softly) Morris. 
We have to take him to Medical. 
I just want to talk to him for a minute. 
Are you okay? 
Give us ten minutes. 
Bill. 
Jack. 
We able to pull anything off the hard drive we found? 
We have. 
Apparently, Fayed's been in contact with Dmitri Gredenko. 
Gredenko? 
It's looking more and more like he's been aiding Fayed's operation all along. 
You think he's here in Los Angeles. 
Evidence on the hard drive points to that. 
What leads do you have on Gredenko? 
Your father's company was contracted to dispose of the nukes Gredenko was to hand over. 
My brother Graem oversaw those contracts, not my father. 
He still might have some information. 
Okay, fine, I'll talk to him. 
Where is he? 
He went to see your brother's body in the morgue. 
Okay, thanks. 
Chloe, you all right? 
Yeah. 
Thank you for saving Morris's life. 
Yeah. 
I'm really glad Fayed didn't kill you this morning. 
Me, too. 
I have to talk to my father. 
I... just want to thank you 
for everything. 
* * Dad. 
Whatever your brother may have done, he didn't deserve this. 
I didn't mean for this to happen. 
Yeah. 
Well... 
Dad, I'm sorry about Graem. 
I am. 
But right now, CTU wants to know about your connection to Dmitri Gredenko. 
What? 
We believe that he's working with Fayed. 
They want to know what you know about him. 
He was the Russian liaison on our government contract to decommission Soviet nukes. Why? 
What kind of dealings did you have with him? 
Couple of phone calls to Moscow, that's about it. 
Do you know of any contacts that Gredenko might have which would allow Fayed to move the remaining four nukes? 
Look, Jack, like I told you, I had virtually no involvement. 
Graem oversaw the project, he dealt with Gredenko. 
Whatever you need to know died with him. 
You know where Marilyn is? 
No. 
Why? 
You gonna question her, too? 
She's probably with Josh. 
He's taking the death of his father pretty hard. 
Leave them alone, Jack. 
Let them grieve in peace. 
I'll make a call to some of the company executives. 
About Gredenko. 
Maybe Graem shared something that I wasn't privy to. 
Thank you. 
DOCTOR: Try to rest. 
You're doing very well. 
You can go in now. 
Morris? 
How are you feeling? 
Say something. 
What is there to say? 
You were tortured. 
You held out as long as you could. 
I armed a nuclear bomb. 
You had to. 
Fayed was gonna kill you. 
I wish to God he had. 
Because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he wants. 
You can't blame yourself. 
When the next bomb goes off, and thousands of more people die, everybody will remember that I was the one that made it possible. 
That's not gonna happen. 
'Cause we're gonna find Fayed and we're gonna stop him, and none of this will matter. 
Are you any closer to finding him? 
No. 
Just go, darling. 
Go. 
(phone rings) Yes, Mr. Bauer? 
We've got a problem. 
Gredenko's here. 
In L.A.? 
Are you sure? 
Yes. 
Only, they don't know where he is. 
We've got to get to him before they do. 
If Gredenko implicates me, everything the company I founded and spent my life protecting it's over, you understand? 
Yes. I'll put a 
team together. 
I'll monitor CTU from here. 
If I hear of anything, I'll call you. 
Yes, sir. 
I don't care what you have to do. 
You find Gredenko, and you kill him. 
Understood. 
I talked to my father about Gredenko. 
He said he'd make some inquiries, but I think it's a dead end. 
He doesn't know anything. 
The news from here isn't much better. 
But Milo managed to trace the fragment he pulled off Fayed's computer to a local I.P. network. 
It confirms Gredenko is definitely here in L.A. 
I've got my people monitoring chatter, data-mining interagency backlogs on Gredenko's activities prior to going underground. 
Right now, that's all we can do. 
Okay. 
Have a seat, Jack. 
What is it? 
It's the toxicology report on your brother's body. 
Forensic evidence indicates that the hyocine-pentathol you administered to Graem during his interrogation caused his coronary. 
There's something else. 
I saw the field tape, and Rick Burke's report for Division. 
He said you exceeded protocols, even after he warned you of dangerous levels. 
That's true. 
Agent Burke tried to warn me. 
Then you pulled a gun on him. 
You must realize how this looks, Jack. 
Coming right after your brother tried to kill you. 
I lost control. 
Because you found out he was responsible for David Palmer's assassination. 
Yes, because I found out about David Palmer's assassination. 
'Cause I found out about everything. 
I lost control. 
I tried to tell you I didn't think I could do this. 
This job. 
I wanted to kill my brother. 
I wanted him dead. 
I was standing over him... 
and I looked up and I saw my father in the doorway... 
and everything just stopped. 
I ordered Agent Burke to shut down the IV, he did. 
I thought we caught it in time. 
Bill, I did not set out... 
to kill my brother. 
I swear to you. 
I can adjust the report before I send it to Division. 
No. 
Jack... 
an Internal Affairs investigation will impede our search for Fayed and Gredenko. 
Right now, you are critical to that. 
You cannot cover this up. 
I ordered Agent Burke to administer the hyocine-pentathol. 
I killed my brother. 
Whatever the consequences are, I accept them. 
Bill... 
do this right. 
Okay. 
I'll submit the report as is. 
There is some difficulty with my statement? 
A little more emphasis on religion, and less on politics than I expected. 
Many of the people you wish me to sway have been persuaded that our cause is a holy one. 
I am not innocent in this manipulation. 
So I must address them in these terms if I am to enlist their cooperation. 
(knocking on glass) Yes? 
Excuse me, sir. 
Vice President Daniels is calling for you. 
Would you like to take it in your office? 
No, I'll take it in here. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me. 
Noah? 
Thank you for taking my call, Mr. President. 
I know you're pressed for time. 
What can I do for you? 
I'll get right to my point. 
I've made no secret of my disappointment that you rejected Tom Lennox's plan for mass internment of Arab nationals in our country. 
The plan did not delineate country of origin, Noah. 
It was nothing more than a blanket proposal to arrest and detain thousands of Muslims living here, without due process I might add. 
Be that as it may, since, as I understand it, the terrorists have now acquired the capability to arm the three remaining nuclear weapons, I'm asking you to reconsider. 
And I thought I told you that my decision was not open for debate. 
Well, that's unfortunate, Mr. President, 
since the majority of your Cabinet feels that you're making a tragic mistake. 
I respect that. 
But I firmly believe that our best chance of stopping further attacks will come from the intelligence drawn from Islamic communities. 
And you hope to obtain that by letting a known terrorist leader address the world on American airwaves. 
The man has murdered countless innocents over the past 20 years, and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him. 
Not entirely... 
but to the extent that he can help us, yes. 
Mr. President... 
you approached me to be your running mate because you knew I could deliver voters who questioned your... 
experience, who were afraid that your Presidency would be too weak on national defense, and I... assured them 
otherwise, but now you're proving them right. 
There's a thin line between conviction and stubbornness. 
You can stand firm, but just know that... 
you're standing alone. 
Are we done? 
Clearly. 
You are paying a very high price for doing this. 
Not as high as my country will pay if I'm wrong. 
As someone who has alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course, I suggest you tread carefully among your people. 
Mr. Assad, our cultures 
are very different, sir. 
It's not just a cultural issue, Mr. President. 
It's simple human nature. 
They will come after you. 
I assure you of that. 
You sure it's safe to talk in here? 
Yes, this area is currently unmonitored. 
All right. 
You intimated you had some sort of plan of dealing with the President. 
Palmer's refusal to implement your proposals will unquestionably lead to the loss of many more American lives. 
And I, and many others like me who love this country, will not stand by idly and let that happen. 
So what is it you propose? 
I think you know. 
I need to hear. 
Definitive action. 
We are in the middle of a national crisis and he is in over his head. 
He's brought this on himself. 
Listen, before you start reconsidering and report me, just know I will deny that we ever had this conversation. 
I'm not... 
I'm not reconsidering. 
I know what you're saying is necessary, I just... 
cannot believe it has come to this. 
Who else is involved? 
You don't need to know that. 
I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. 
Right now you're dealing with me. 
Vice President Daniels, is he involved? 
No. 
The vice president doesn't know anything about this. 
But we do know that he shares our sentiment in regard to the current state of affairs, and that he will enact your initiatives once he has the power to do so. 
You seem pretty certain this is going to work. 
More so with your help. 
I need the President's itinerary. 
Specifically, in regards to Assad's televised address. 
I do not have the proper clearance. 
I need you to access it. 
Why? W-why do you need this? 
Damn it, Reed. 
We're talking about removing the President of the United States. 
Do not keep me in the dark here. 
I never said that I was the architect of this. 
I'm just a conduit. 
Besides, for your sake, I think that it is very important that we maintain a certain level of plausible deniability. 
The less you know, the better. 
I'll get you that itinerary. 
Marilyn. 
Hi. 
I heard you were with Josh, I didn't want to disturb you. 
Yeah, well, he's taking it pretty hard. 
He loved his father very much. 
I'm very sorry. 
You don't owe me an apology. 
Maybe they haven't told you the circumstances of Graem's heart attack. 
They told me enough. 
Look, Jack, I know the kind of man Graem was. 
Even if he did die because of your interrogation, I don't blame you. 
I blame him. 
The truth is, I've been trying to leave Graem for years. 
But he threatened to take Josh away from me. 
Said I'd never see him again. 
Did Josh know what he was like? 
No. 
I always tried to protect him from the truth about his father. 
What have you told him about his father's death? 
Only that he had a heart attack. 
That's enough for now. 
Yeah. 
I'm sorry, I have to go back to work. 
If there's anything I can do. 
Is it true there are more bombs out there? 
Yes. 
Are you any closer to finding them? 
No, we've hit a road block. 
Right now we're looking for a Russian operative who we believe is helping the terrorists. 
Graem knew him. 
Russian? 
A man named Gredenko. 
You know him? 
No. 
Come here. 
But you know something. 
Maybe. 
It was probably nothing. 
It was months ago. 
Marilyn, anything you can tell us might help. 
Graem was going out a lot at night, and, uh, he said it was work related, but I didn't believe him. 
I thought he was having an affair on me, so one night I followed him. 
It wasn't out of jealousy. 
It was... it was 
for leverage. 
Anything I could use against him to get custody of Josh if I left him. 
Where did he go? 
It was to a house in West L.A. 
I went to the window. 
The blinds were drawn, but I could hear him inside talking to some men. 
They had Russian accents. 
What were they saying? 
I couldn't hear them clearly enough, and frankly, once I realized he wasn't cheating on me, I got in the car and went home. 
Do you remember the address of the house? 
No. Jack, I'm sorry, 
I wasn't paying attention, I was more concerned about getting caught. 
Marilyn, it is vital that we find this man Gredenko. 
If we retrace the route that you took that night, do you think that you would recognize the house? 
Maybe. 
Maybe? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. I think so. 
Wait right here. 
Jack. 
I think I might have a lead on Gredenko. 
It's a real shot in the dark, but right now we don't have anything. 
I wanted to know if I had your permission to follow it up. 
What do you got? 
Hey, Marilyn. 
Hey, Phillip. 
How you doing? 
I'm hanging in there. 
What's going on with you and Jack? 
He's looking for someone. 
He thinks I can help. 
You mean Gredenko? 
He questioned me about the same thing earlier. 
What do you know about him? 
Nothing really. 
I followed Graem to a house one night. 
He, um, he met with some Russians. 
What house? 
I don't know. 
It was in West L.A. 
Jack wants to take me over there to see if it can jog my memory. 
Phillip, I don't know how long this is gonna take. 
And I can't leave Josh alone. 
Could you please stay with him? 
Yeah, sure. 
Thanks. 
Your Tac team's assembling outside. 
I'm sending Milo along with you. 
Milo? Why? 
I want a tech available to pull intel off any computers we might find at Gredenko's location. 
Chloe will be running point from here. 
Okay, fine. 
I'm sorry about leaving you, sweetheart. 
But I'll be back as soon as I'm done helping Uncle Jack. 
Helping him with what? 
Where are you going? 
I'll explain later. 
Right now I want you to stay here with your grandfather, all right? 
Marilyn. 
I was thinking maybe I would take Josh back to my house. 
Why? 
Why can't you just wait with him here until I get back? 
Marilyn, look, he's frightened of this place. 
Understandably so. 
I think he needs to be in familiar surroundings right now. 
All right. 
All right, I'll, um, I'll clear it with Mr. Buchanan. 
Will you explain things to Josh? 
Yeah, sure. 
All right, you listen to your grandfather. 
He's in charge. 
Phillip, thank you. 
Sure. 
Sorry to take you away from Josh. 
All you need to do is identify the house. 
I promise you I will not put you in any danger. 
I know. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
I'd like it if Josh's grandfather could take him back to his house. 
Of course. 
We should go. 
Bill, I'll be on comm. 
We'll be leaving soon, Josh. 
I have to make one phone call. 
Just be a minute. 
MAN (on phone): Yes, sir. 
Have your men find and secure a house in West L.A. 
Fine. 
I'll text you with the address. 
Morris, we have a lead. 
Jack's sister-in-law thinks she knows where Gredenko is. 
Jack and a Tac team are heading over there now. 
I need your help running tactical. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
We're shorthanded. 
So get your shirt on, and let's go. 
Running tactical is what you do best, why would you need my help? 
Oh... I get it. 
You came in here to give me a pep talk. 
Get me back working behind that computer and everything will be tickety-boo. 
Why don't you be a little less obvious, Chloe. 
I'm a coward, not an idiot. 
Morris, I know you've been through a lot today, but you're really starting to piss me off. 
Well, let's add that to my list of failings. 
Why did you do that? 
I didn't want to. 
Look... 
if you're gonna try and save a bloke... 
save someone who's worth it. 
Stop it, stop it. 
Jack and his team are entering a hostile situation and they need CTU back up. 
Yes, I can do it alone, but there'd be less chance of a mistake if you would help. 
So why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself and get back to work! 
Milo, we just passed 98th Street. 
Roger that, Jack, we're maintaining our position six blocks behind you. 
I can't imagine what you went through in China, Jack. 
When you were over there, I thought about you. 
I tried not to. 
I guess, I've been trying not to think about you for over 20 years. 
Marilyn, we don't need to talk about this. 
It was your father, wasn't it? 
He drove you away. 
Tried to pressure you to work for his company. 
Is that why you left, and enlisted in the military? 
There were a lot of reasons. 
Was I one of them? 
No. 
(phone rings) Hello? 
Marilyn, it's me. 
Don't say anything... 
just listen. 
I don't want Jack to know I'm on the line. 
Do you understand? 
Okay. 
You're involved in something that's much bigger than you can possibly imagine. 
So here's the deal. 
Unless you do exactly what I say... 
I will hurt Josh. 
If you don't believe that, you might want to consider this... 
Graem's death was not an accident. 
I killed him. 
I want you to say, "Thank you, Susan." 
Thank you, Susan. 
Now, you're not going to take Jack to the house where Graem met the Russians you're going to take him to a different address 9407 Hindry Place. 
You got it? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
Now, you do this for me, and I promise you, you will see Josh again. 
If you don't, he dies. 
Okay. 
9407 Hindry Place. 
Do the right thing, Marilyn. 
I already lost a son today. 
Don't make me lose a grandson. 
Good-bye, Susan. 
Are you all right? 
Fine. 
Here you go. 
Thank you. 
That was my office. 
A lot of the roads are still shut because of the bomb. 
Can we get home? 
No. And no one knows seems to 
know when they'll open up again. 
Then what do we do? 
We'll go to a hotel. 
We can stay there until they clear up. 
Marilyn, is any of this familiar? 
Yes. 
Jack? 
What? 
What is it? 
It's nothing. 
I thought I saw the house. 
But I was wrong. 
Oh, that was it. 
Hindry Place. 
Milo, we got a street. 
Hindry Place. 
Copy that, Jack. 
Relaying it to CTU now. 
How long before the new targets are reprogrammed? 
20 minutes. 
You still think you can trust the Arabs? 
They serve their purpose. 
Our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans. 
Today we will correct that mistake. 
And the Arabs will take all the blame. 
All right, we're on it. 
Chloe. 
Marilyn remembers the street where she believes her husband met with Gredenko. 
Hindry Place. 
That's a mile away from where they're looking. Is she sure? 
That's what she told Jack. 
Pull up all access roads in and out of the area. 
I'm in the middle of reconfiguring the uplink. 
I'll put Morris on it. 
Your call. 
I know you're lying to me. 
Just like my mom. 
You're all treating me like I'm just some stupid little kid. 
What are you talking about? 
I want to know why my dad died. 
What's your mother told you? 
It was a heart attack. 
I know, but... 
I know he was doing something illegal or whatever. 
But nobody's telling me what it was, and I just want to know. 
Did it have to do with the nuke? 
Look, Josh... 
you're gonna hear a lot of things about your father, what he may or may not have done. 
I'm not gonna pretend it's going to be easy for you. 
You know, no matter what... 
I'm gonna be there for you. 
That's it. The pale blue 
house on the right. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
We've got an address. 
9407 Hindry Place. 
Initiate tactical response with CTU. 
Have them bring up the schematics of the house. 
Meet me in the alley behind the target. 
All right, I'm on it. 
Hold on. 
We're going after the blue house. 
Advise your men, non-lethal force. 
We need Gredenko alive. 
Jack... 
Marilyn, I want you to stay in the tactical van. 
You'll be safe there. 
But, I have... 
Jack, I've got the schematics. 
There are two entrances. 
One in the front, one on the west side of the house. 
Okay, I'll contact CTU as soon as we've got Gredenko in custody. 
Milo, I want you to stay with Marilyn. 
Are your men ready? 
We're set. 
Let's go. 
All teams go. Go! 
Go! Go! 
Bomb! Everyone out! 
(loud explosion) Oh! 
Jack! 
We've gotta go! 
No! No! 
Get in the van! 
Get in the van and close the door! 
Jack? Jack, can you hear me? 
(automatic gunfire) (tires screeching) Oh, they're coming! 
Get out! Come on! Move! Move! 
(screams) Don't hit the woman! 
We need her alive! 
(gunshots blasting) Move! 
Move! Come on, come on! Move! 
Go, go, go! 
(grunting): All agents report in. 
All agents report in now. 
Calling in for EMT. 
Congratulations, Tom. 
It's an excellent plan. 
It's about time someone in this administration stood up to these people. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. 
The American-Muslim community is our best line of defense against these terrorists. 
Your plan... 
would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop Fayed. 
I remain convinced that implementing this plan would be a terrible mistake. 
15 minutes ago, the NSA picked up a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed. 
McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes. 
CHLOE: Oh, my God. It's Morris. 
JACK: Morris, it's a setup. 
The engineer McCarthy's looking for-- it's you. 
(two gunshots) Get out of the car or the next one's in your head. 
We're on our way. 
We'll be waiting. 
With my money? 
FAYED: You'll get paid as soon as I have what I want. 
I'm just delivering him. 
You'll have to make him cooperate. 
How do I find McCarthy?! 
Four cc's! 
His vitals are spiking across the line. 
JACK: Four cc's! 
Jack, don't. 
It has nothing to do with McCarthy. 
It has to do with Palmer. 
David Palmer? 
I gave the order for his assassination. 
JACK: Not only was he responsible for David Palmer's assassination, he directed the entire conspiracy. 
He was trying to protect my father's company. 
Then... 
You told them about Palmer. 
I had to give them something, make them think I cracked, but I kept you out of it. 
Dad, stick to the plan. 
Sometimes you have to make adjustments. 
My son's had a seizure! 
PHILLIP: If you people killed my son, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I'm en route to the ambush site. 
You need to tell me which direction they took Morris. 
I'm bringing it up now. 
Jack, what are they gonna do to him? 
Chloe, they have to keep him alive long enough to try and make the bombs operational. 
That means we've got time. 
I need you to remain calm and pull up the satellite now. 
I'm trying; the server's not responding. 
That's 'cause you're not coordinates correctly. 
I know what I'm doing. 
Have you confirmed this with the field team? 
Yes. 
Jack's on line 1. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
We just got word from the field team at your brother's house. 
Graem's dead, Jack. 
What happened? 
We'll know more after an autopsy, but all signs point to cardiac arrest. 
Because of the interrogation. 
The medic on site believes that was a factor. 
My father know? 
Yes, he was there. 
But your sister-in-law and nephew were already en route to CTU when it happened. 
Bill, I'd really appreciate it if you would be the one to break the news to her. 
Of course, Jack. 
Sir. 
Stand by. 
Chloe's starting to screw up. 
She's worried about Morris. 
I think she's losing it. 
Chloe, have you accessed the uplink yet? 
Not yet. 
Listen, I know what you must be feeling, but if there's a problem... 
Get away from me! 
There's not a problem! 
The only problem is people like you bothering me when I'm trying to do my job. 
Chloe, give up your post to Milo. 
Leave me alone; I can do this! 
Now. 
Fine. 
Jack, I've had to relieve Chloe. 
She's too distraught to function. 
You're on with Milo. 
Jack, just give me a second. 
Okay, I got McCarthy on satellite 13 minutes ago, abducting Morris in a silver Maserati at the corner of Central and Third. 
I'm tracking them to their current position. 
All right, right now McCarthy's at Adams and 13th, heading west. 
Copy that. 
We should have a visual in the next couple minutes. 
How long is it gonna take the TAC teams to intercept McCarthy on the ground? 
I don't know. 
We'll get back to you. 
Where are we taking him? 
Fayed will call soon. 
Just relax. Drive. 
I am relaxed. 
I just want to get this over with. 
It's never gonna be over. 
CTU knows who you are. 
They're already looking for you. 
Shut up. 
Is that possible? 
Don't listen to him. 
He's bluffing. 
So you're not Darren McCarthy, arms dealer, subcontracted by BXJ Technologies. 
CTU intercepted a transmission about Fayed hiring you to do this. 
I said shut up! 
Right. 
We're handing him over to Fayed as planned. 
If I'm already a marked man, might as well get paid for it. 
What about me? 
He didn't say they know about you. 
And anyway, I'll take care of you, like always. 
(helicopter whirring overhead) Chopper? 
That's a chopper. 
I got him. I got him. 
We got a visual. 
Turn left. 
But why... 
Just do what I say! 
Just do it! 
Swing back. 
JACK: They just took off. 
They must have spotted us. 
All right, I got them turning north onto Anders. 
Go around them. 
I, uh... 
Go around them! 
What?! 
Just do it! 
No! 
Oh, my God. 
Are they still there? 
Yes. 
Turn there! 
We got a problem up here. 
They're headed to the 110 interchange. 
Damn it. We just lost them. 
Does CalTrans have any cameras that are covering that area? 
No. 
Nothing. 
TAC team is still five minutes away. 
Captain, I want you to put me down now. 
Do you know what this is about? 
Fayed, the man you're taking me to, is the terrorist who set off the nuclear bomb in Valencia. 
He has four more bombs. 
But he needs me to make them work, so that he can kill tens of thousands of innocent people. 
And all you have to do to stop that from happening is to uncuff me. 
McCarthy's right. 
CTU doesn't know you exist. 
For the love of God, all of those people's lives are on you. 
Let's go. 
Shouldn't I get my luggage? 
Forget about the luggage! 
Come on! 
You did not tell me this is about nuclear bombs. 
What this is about is about $7 million. 
Now, get in the truck! 
MILO: Pressman. 
They dumped the car. 
They must have switched vehicles. 
From the underpass, they could've merged directly onto any one of six local roads or highways. 
There's no way of tracking them without knowing exactly what vehicle they're in. 
Damn it, Milo. 
They could be anywhere! 
The TAC team's here. 
Get back to me. 
Head south. 
I'm sorry. 
Hello. 
I have a new place for us to meet. 
Are you certain you're not being followed? 
Yeah. 
What's the address? 
4332 Florence Avenue, apartment 621. 
Have you got my money? 
Yes. 
Turn on the GPS. 
Apartment 621. 
All right? 
Don't forget it. 
Okay, good. 
It's not too far. 
Yes, yes. 
Thank God. 
A bit excessive, but you did the right thing. 
Now I've got to contact CTU and give them... 
Shut up! 
Shut up! 
Fayed wants you alive, and whatever shape you're in beyond that is up to you. 
Oh, come on. What are you doing? 
I am making $7 million. 
And I can spend it without having to worry about CTU. 
Listen... 
I know you think I'm wrong, and that I blindsided you by not backing your proposals. 
Correct on both counts, sir. 
Tom, I have always valued your counsel. 
Ever since you showed up at my home and convinced me to run, spearheaded my campaign. 
I mean, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here. 
But I do hope I can still count on you to help me implement my polices. 
AGENT DAN: Excuse me, Mr. President. 
The plane carrying Hamri Al-Assad has landed at Andrews Air Force Base. 
He'll be here soon. 
Thank you. 
We'll talk later. 
(knocking) Mr. Lennox? 
Uh... 
Everything's okay. 
We're fine in here. Thank you. 
What happened? 
The President just rejected every one of my proposals right there in front of the Cabinet. 
Not only has he changed his mind on the internment plan, he is rolling back on the detention facilities that are already in place. 
I thought... I thought 
he was on board. 
Well, so did I. 
Now he's putting forth his own agenda to try and appease the Muslim population. 
Is he hoping that they're going to cooperate and help find the nuclear weapons? 
That's it! That's it! 
And all he will succeed in doing is to prove to the terrorists that he does not have the stomach to do what is necessary and inevitable. 
Okay. Then you need to use your 
influence to change his mind. 
My...? 
My influence? 
You don't get it, do you, Reed? 
I have no influence. 
Not here. 
Not in this administration. 
No, I'm resigning. 
Sir, that would be a terrible mistake. 
My mistake was to believe that Wayne Palmer has the courage and the vision to fill this office. 
Clearly, I overestimated him. 
He is certainly not his brother. 
Which makes it all the more important that you stay. 
Sir, you have the support of a great many people here, the least of which is the Vice President. 
Well, unfortunately, the Vice President is not the one in power. 
And this country is being led to slaughter by the man who is. 
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. 
I can't, in good conscience, be party to this. I can't. 
Sir, sir, this is a terrible mistake. 
Reed, I cannot talk about this any further. 
Go now and draft my letter of resignation and bring it to me now for me to sign. 
Yes, sir. 
CARSON: Yes? 
Yeah, it's Reed. 
Palmer just shot down the Lennox plan in the Cabinet meeting. 
He's rejecting every one of the initiatives. 
Did you hear what I said? 
I heard. 
Looks like we have no choice. 
We'll have to move ahead with what we all talked about. 
I realize it's extreme, but under the circumstances, I don't see any alternative. 
Do you? 
No. But there's a problem. 
Tom Lennox is resigning. 
When? 
As soon as I write his letter of resignation. 
Carson, if he goes, I lose my job. 
And I lose my access. 
Our plan is contingent on your proximity to the President. 
We need you in place. 
I know, I am very well aware of that, but Tom Lennox is determined to quit. 
He might reconsider if he knew what was coming. 
I suppose I could feel him out. 
Then do it, carefully. 
We have to protect ourselves. 
Has anything turned up on CalTrans? 
Without knowing what vehicle McCarthy switched in to, it's going to take hours to scan through frame grabs. 
Stay on it. Right now, 
it's all we've got. 
Mrs. Bauer. 
Yes? 
I'm Bill Buchanan, Director of Operations. 
You must be Josh. 
May I speak with you a moment? 
Privately. 
Um... 
It's okay, Mom. 
Okay. 
What is it? 
I'm very sorry to have to tell you. 
Your husband is dead. 
How? 
He appears to have suffered a heart attack. 
What did Jack do to him? 
I assure you there'll be a thorough investigation. 
Your father-in-law is accompanying Graem's body here for an autopsy. 
Unless you have an objection. 
No. 
I have to tell my son. 
Of course. 
Josh. 
Your mother wants to speak with you. 
MARILYN: He had a heart attack. 
He died. 
JOSH: What? No. 
Pressman. 
It's Jack. 
Let me speak to Buchanan. 
Hold on. 
Sir... Jack's on the line. 
Jack? 
Bill, we found McCarthy's body less than three blocks away from the interchange. 
We intercepted a call from LAPD. 
The witness said the shooter was a female, drove off with a male fitting Morris's description in a silver pickup. 
Did the witness get a license plate? 
No. But McCarthy 
received a call just about five minutes ago. 
The caller ID is blocked. 
I need you to trace the source of the call. 
You think the call came from Fayed? 
Yeah. 
I'll give it to Milo as soon as you upload the phone's data. 
It's on its way. 
Knock. 
MAN: What do you want? 
I'm Darren McCarthy's associate. 
I've got your package. 
Who are you? 
Where's McCarthy? 
He's waiting to hear from me. 
If he doesn't get the money, he gives you up. 
This is the engineer? 
Look, this... I don't know 
what you're talking about. 
I-I'm just a data analyst. 
You've got the wrong man. 
Look... 
I've brought you what you want. 
Just give me the money, and I'll go. 
You'll get your money when this man completes his task. 
You work at CTU, so you know I have four nuclear suitcase bombs in my possession. 
You may also know these bombs need to be reprogrammed before I can use them. 
You are here to create a device that will allow me to do so. 
(quivering): Well, not bloody likely, mate. 
You're going to modify this so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs. 
(inhales deeply): No, I'm not. 
Bill, what's happening with the phone trace? 
BUCHANAN: Milo's still working on it, Jack. 
What is it taking so long? 
Checking into it now. 
Milo... 
what's your status? 
All I've got is that the call was made from a landline. 
But the number was routed through at least a dozen different servers, and they keep cycling back on each other. 
(bangs table): Come on! 
Are you going to be able to do this? 
CHLOE: Milo. 
Let me try. 
I know I screwed up earlier. 
I wasn't thinking clearly, but let me try this. 
I need to. 
All right. 
The number strings are caught in a loop matrix. 
CHLOE: Did you try running a SatCom overlay filter? 
That only works on cell-to-cell communication. 
This call was placed from a hardline. 
NSA recently started using satellite carrier systems as a backup for all phone traffic. 
You just have to reconfigure the embedded decryption program to... Got it. 
That's it. 
All right. 
McCarthy's call was made from an apartment building: 4332 Florence Avenue. 
Did you copy that, Jack? 
Yeah, do we know which apartment? 
No, there's no way to tell; they tapped directly into the building's trunk line. 
Our men are ready to move. 
Have tactical meet us over there. 
Tell them to set up a perimeter. 
Stay out of sight. 
Understood. 
Good work, Milo. 
Sir, it wasn't me. 
If you think she's ready, bring her back in. 
Mr. Al-Assad... 
right this way. 
I've checked out your background. 
And despite my understandable skepticism, I do believe you're serious about wanting this negotiated peace. 
On my own terms, yes. 
Let's table your terms for the time being while we discuss mine. 
My country, sir... 
has suffered a nuclear attack by the very same terrorists who used to follow you. 
Thousands of innocent Americans are dead or dying as we speak. 
I'm aware of the tragedy in California, Mr. President. 
I was there. 
Then you understand, that if Fayed successfully detonates any more nuclear weapons on US soil, there will be no chance whatsoever for a peace agreement. 
The American people are demanding that we strike back. 
And not just at organizations such as yours, but at the governments that support them. 
Now, if just one more nuke goes off, one more, we won't have a choice. 
You understand me? 
We're talking about war. 
You don't have to tell me what is at stake, but I still don't understand what you want from me. 
I would like you to appear on television and make a public address to the world. 
Declare your intentions for peace, and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere to come forward with any information regarding Fayed. 
You flatter me if you think I hold sway over all Islam. 
No, sir, not all. 
Just the extremists who share your hatred of the West. 
I certainly can't reach out to them for help, but I know you can. 
But perception is everything, Mr. President. 
So I must present my agenda to my own people in my own time, not by appearing on American television from The White House. 
Fayed has already called me a traitor, and many others will follow him if there is even a suspicion that I am an American puppet. 
Not a puppet, a partner, at least when it comes to finding these nuclear weapons. 
Now, that's what we have to be for your peace initiative to have any chance of working, so get used to it! 
Now, between you and me, sir, I really don't give a damn how and when you wanted to present your agenda; the time is now. 
You want to lead this peace initiative... 
then lead. 
Who's in command? 
Agent Turner. 
Agent Turner, what's the status of your perimeter? 
It's in place. 
We've got agents in plainclothes covering the exits to the building, and we have three TAC teams in position to move in on your command. 
Do you have confirmation that Fayed's in the building? 
Not directly, but the building manager ID'd Morris O'Brian entering the building with a woman less than 20 minutes ago. 
We assume the woman is the driver your witness saw shoot McCarthy. 
There are no cameras in the building. 
We don't know what apartment or floor they're on. 
CTU is patched in and awaiting your word. 
Thank you. 
Turn it on. 
Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy? 
Yes, Jack. Go ahead. 
I'm at the staging area. 
We have a confirmation that Morris is inside the building. 
We do not have confirmation on Fayed. 
There are no cameras in the building. 
Do have infrared satellite? 
We can't get a live feed, but we do have a satellite in position uploading images at five-minute intervals. 
The latest scan shows 215 people in the building, spread out over six floors and 112 apartments. 
It's going to take too long to go room by room. 
We're going to have to figure out another way ID them. 
Is this building on the city's emergency services grid? 
Yes, Jack. All buildings over 
ten units are required to. 
Chloe, it's good to have you back. 
I'm to need you to get into their system, and trigger an all-building fire alarm. 
Okay, we just have to get past their log-in screen. 
Let me know when you're ready. 
Agent. 
Please... 
please, stop. 
Just indicate you'll do what I've asked, and we will stop. 
People are leaving the building. 
There really is a fire. 
What do we do? 
There's no fire. 
CTU knows we're here. 
I really need to get out of here. 
Shut up! 
Up against the wall. 
Your time is up! 
I will use this all over your body until you die of shock or blood loss. 
Then I'll just find someone else to do what I need. 
Do you understand? 
Look, please... 
I don't care about the money. 
I made a mistake. 
Just let me get out of here. 
Please. 
So, you give up the seven million, huh? 
Yes. 
Okay. 
Oh! 
Stop... stop! 
I'll do it. 
Come in. 
This memo says Palmer's arranging for Assad to make a televised statement. 
I heard. 
Not only are we providing free airtime to a mass murderer and a vowed enemy of democracy, we are proving terrorism works. 
You have my letter of resignation? 
No, sir, I don't. 
Why not? 
Because you can't resign while this country is being brought to the brink of a nuclear holocaust by a weak, misguided President. 
Damn it, Reed. I explained... 
I cannot get the President to budge on policy. 
There's nothing I can do about this. 
What if I told you that the climate could change? 
What does that even mean, the climate? 
Well, I'm just saying that there are people who believe, like you, that more aggressive steps need to be taken to crack down on terrorism, both here at home and abroad, and that a change in leadership is imperative to ensure this nation's security. 
Um... 
Who? 
Excuse me, sir? 
Who are these like-minded people we're talking about? 
I was... I'm just 
speaking abstractly. 
But you'd have to agree that, uh... 
your plan would have all the support it needed if the Vice President were the man occupying the Oval Office. 
Wait... 
Now, I may dislike the President's current course of action. 
I hardly think it warrants his, his removal. 
I'm not talking about holding hearings. 
Something more immediate would have to happen. 
Oh, my God... 
You can't possibly be intimating what I think you are. 
I'm not intimating anything. 
I'm just simply musing. 
Careful. 
That kind of musing can get you thrown into prison for treason. 
Well, I'm sorry, sir, that you've misunderstood me. 
Yeah, I certainly hope so, for your sake. 
All right. 
I think you have a letter to draft for me. 
FIREFIGHTER (on bullhorn): You need to keep a safe distance away from the building until we have determined there is no danger. 
Please move across the street away from the building. 
Anything from your men on the ground? 
They've looked at everyone who's exited the building. 
There's no sign of Fayed or O'Brian. 
If they were inside when the alarm went off, they're still in there. 
Damn it. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, it's Bill. 
Go ahead. 
We've got the latest infrared. 
We're mirroring it to your screen. 
Hold on. 
I've got it. 
I'm looking at it now. 
Okay, there's three people left in the apartments on the second, fourth and sixth floors. 
We need to narrow that down. 
Chloe, who's renting those apartments? 
Superimposing building department schematics and cross-referencing with phone company and police records now. 
Okay, the woman on the second floor is handicapped. 
She probably didn't leave because she can't. 
The other two apartments are occupied by single males; the man on the fourth floor has been arrested several times for distribution of narcotics. 
Fayed wouldn't use anyone with a criminal record to set up a safe house. 
Our hostiles are in the sixth floor apartment. 
Get your men ready. 
We're moving in. 
All right, let's go! 
How much longer? 
I don't know. 
McCarthy said this is a few minutes' work for an advanced programmer. 
You're stalling for time. 
I am not. 
It'll be ready in a minute. 
Most everybody seems to have evacuated the building. 
Which is how they intend to find us. 
At this point it's only a question of time. 
Go. 
It's done? 
Yes. 
Bring it. 
You have the bombs here? 
Just one. 
Let's see if you did your work correctly. 
Arm it. 
Arm it! 
Very good. 
Kill him. 
Please, I did what you asked, didn't I? 
Now. 
All agents sound off! 
Clear. 
AGENT: We're clear. 
We took a head count of the bodies. 
One hostile's missing; we haven't found Fayed. 
It's clear, sir. 
Have your men maintain the search for Fayed. 
I want them to identify every possible exit from this apartment. 
Yes, sir. 
What's his status? 
Unconscious, but alive. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Morris has been injured, but he's alive. 
Mr. Bauer, you need to see this. 
(into earpiece): CTU, this is Bauer. 
Jack, be careful. 
The bomb has a fail-safe device that prevents any forced entry. 
Through the glass casing I have two small metal plates slowly converging on each other. 
Those are the trigger plates, Jack; once they touch an electrical charge will detonate the core causing the nuke to explode. 
How far apart are they? 
Approximately three inches. 
Okay, that gives us only about three minutes. 
There's a small metal box to the right of it. 
You need to carefully unscrew the top of it. 
Copy that. 
AGENT TURNER: Agent Bauer, we know how Fayed got out. 
They opened up a wall in one of the closets to get access to the building's ventilation system. 
From there, Fayed could get to the basement, and, in turn, the sewer tunnels. 
Did you mobilize your teams and set up a perimeter? 
Yes, sir. But we believe 
Fayed's already gone. 
Witnesses report a helicopter taking off from a nearby field a few minutes ago. 
It appeared to be a medical evac chopper, so it got through our net. 
Damn it. 
The top's off. 
Come on, Chloe. 
We are running out of time. 
Okay, under the gears you should see four wires. 
Short-circuit each of them. 
That should stop the left gear from rotating. 
You can access the dip switches underneath it to open the case and manually stop the trigger. 
Okay, the left gear stopped moving. 
I see the dip switches. 
They're all in the up position. 
What's next? 
Um... 
Switch three and four to the down position. 
Nothing happened. 
The case didn't open. 
It didn't? 
That's what I said. 
It didn't open. 
Hold on. 
(bomb buzzing) Chloe, we are almost out of time. 
Okay, I have an updated schematic. 
It wasn't switches three and four. 
You need to push four and five to the down position, and the cover will open. 
Are you sure this time? 
I'm about as sure as I'm going to be before this bomb goes off. 
It's done. 
The bomb is disarmed. 
Notify your men the bomb's been deactivated. 
It's over. 
MORRIS: It's not over. 
What are you talking about? 
The reprogramming device that Fayed had me build for him. 
If it's not here, it means he took it with him. 
And with it, he can activate the other bombs he has anytime he wants. 
You gave him something that worked? 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
CTU, did you copy that? 
BUCHANAN: We got it, Jack. 
Alert the President immediately. 
Organize two teams: one to search the apartment, one to search around the building. 
Agent O'Brian will tell you what you're looking for. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
You see this flash report in from CTU? 
I'm reading it now. 
They let Fayed slip through their fingers... again. 
Apparently he now has the capability to arm these remaining suitcase nukes. 
This situation is immeasurably worse. 
You know my letter of resignation? 
Have you got that? 
Yes, I just, uh... 
I just finished printing it. 
I can bring it over to you right now. 
No, no, no. 
No, just tear that up. 
What? 
Um... 
That talk we were having in my office, I don't think I misunderstood you. 
And I... 
would like to discuss this... further. 
Not on this phone. 
I'll let you know when I have a secure location. 
America has been victimized again. 
Last night terrorist attack in San Antonio was not the latest in this series of bombings that began 11 weeks ago in 10 different cities. 
Retrieve the package. 
Call me when you have it. 
 What happened? 
 You shouldn't have come here, Scott. 
I don't wanna hurt you... 
But I will unless you do exactly what I say. 
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney. 
There's no terrorist here. 
Yes, this is Sandra Palmer. 
I'd like to speak with my brother. 
The FBI was just here and they wanted access to the IAA personel records. 
You know I have to do whatever I can to stop this attacks. 
All that includes giving the law inforcement the autority to follow up whatever single lead they get. 
I can't find the files. 
They've been erased. 
Don't bother trying to recall them. 
I used the shredding program. 
Sandra, what're you doing? 
You're under arrest. 
Take Mr Al-Rezani in custody. 
Wait a minute, he has nothing to do with this. 
Don't move. Where is Assad? 
Put down your weapon. 
I came here alone. 
Fayed has set you up. 
He provided CTU with the coordinates to this house. 
Move! Move! 
I've gotten most of my people and the governments that support us to agree to a cease fire with the West. 
And that's Fayed wants to sabotage? 
 Yes. 
But finding Fayed is the key. 
These are Fayed's men. 
They're going in the subway. 
I can't let 'em get on the train. 
Only the bomber is getting on the train. 
The other man is the handler. 
You follow the handler. 
I'm going after the bomber. 
It's a bomb! 
 We're heading in your direction. 
 I copy that. I'll find you. 
Just stay with the handler. 
He's our only connection to Fayed. 
The following takes place between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.(del vo) 
You still have Fayed's man in sight? 
He's in a grey Sedan, about 6 cars ahead. 
 Yes. 
 Are you on schedulled? 
Yeah, there was some traffic around Union Station. 
 But I'm on the road now. 
 There has been a change. 
I need you to make that stop in Newhall before you come back here. 
The Americans will be feeling helpless now. 
I'm making the call. 
The casualty estimates in St Louis is resumed to 112. 
The mall attack in Baltimore is even worse. 
Over 200 dead. 
Many of them children. 
My God. 
What about the bomb in Los Angeles? 
We confirmed that Jack Bauer averted the attack at the Union Station. 
Passive surveillance from Metro Transit has also confirmed he's working with Assad. 
Have you been able to contact him? 
No, sir. 
Jack's been dark since he called to warn us about Fayed. 
We didn't listen. 
I didn't listen. 
We're receiving a call from Fayed. 
He demands to speak with the President. 
Mr President, we're receivnig a call on a scrambled channel from Fayed, sir. 
He's demanding to speak with you. 
Put him on. 
This is President Palmer. 
Mr President, we've proven we can strike at you anytime anywhere. 
But I'm prepared to offer you a cease-fire. 
 If you meet my demands. 
 Your demands? 
Fayed we match your demands before, remember? 
When you deceived us about Assad being the one behind these attacks. 
And now you expect me to just accept your assurances of a cease-fire. 
I expect you'll take any action that holds a promise of avoiding the loss of more american lives. 
What do you want? 
You're holding 110 so called enemy combattants at your Palmdale military facility. 
In violation of the international law. 
You must have all these freedom fighters on a non-military aircraft in the air by the end of the hour. 
The pilot will be informed of the destination once the plane is outside your country's airspace. 
Even if I agree to this  there is not enough time for us to  You'll find a way. 
Because if you don't release the prisonners by the deadline, the consequences will be immediate and devastating. 
I will only make this offer once, Mr President. 
For your country's sake... 
I hope you accept it. 
Is it even possible, that's what these attacks have been about? 
Releasing the prisonners at Palmdale? 
Sir, I feel it's wishful thinking to assume this is Fayed's endgame. 
Bill, contact Palmdale. 
Find out exactly what will be involved in making this happen. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr President... 
you cannot seriously consider giving in to this man's demands. 
I mean you said yourself: Fayed cannot be trusted. 
No, he can't. 
And, Tom, I don't believe for one second he has any intention of stopping these attacks. 
Not permanently. 
But going along with this buys us more time to find Fayed. 
At the very least, it gives the country a respite from the bombings. 
Sir, you'd be releasing 110 extremely dangerous terrorists. 
Karen, I am very well aware of that. 
But unless we find Fayed, I may be forced to. 
 We got a problem. 
 What? 
He's heading north. 
The farther he gets outside of the city, the less traffic we'll have to hide in. 
It's gonna be more difficult to track him all the way without him seing us. 
 What else can we do? 
 We need to call CTU. 
They can give us satellite coverage. 
No, I said no CTU. They killed my men, 
they tried to kill me! 
That's because Fayed made them believe you were behind the bombings. 
I do not work with my enemies. 
You're working with one now. 
You might hate this country, you might hate its values but if you were serious about disarming, about bringing your organization and others to the table, then you know you have to compromise. 
That is your political reality. 
Who's to say they won't put me in prison once they have me? 
I can't tell you they won't. 
But right now, that is our only lead to Fayed. 
Make the call. 
Thank you. 
Morris, I need you to load this. 
What is it? 
The President just got a call from Fayed. 
He demands we release all the prisonners from Palmdale. 
We need to valid each one in case he goes through with it. 
What he wants is some pretty serious high grade terrorist suspect. 
Calm down, no one's not even go. 
Excuse-me... 
Are you refusing to do this? 
I think you should give this one to the girls in Archives. 
I'm working on Fayed threats, that's more important. 
Okay, I don't really care what you think is important. 
It's not your place to tell me what's important. 
Just calm down. 
I'm trying to help you do your job. 
You have to evaluate directives that come down. 
You can't just keep wasting the time of your most important analysts. 
 I'm not... 
 Morris. 
What? What? 
I want you to put filters on each one of these files. 
If I don't have results on my screen in 20 minutes you are outta here. 
Grow up. 
 O'Brian. 
 Chloe, this is Jack. 
I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again. 
I don't have a lotta time. 
I need to speak to Bill Buchanan. 
Hold on. 
Buchanan. 
It's Jack on line 1. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 I'm in a car with Assad. 
We're tracking one of the suspects in the train bombing. 
We know you're working with Assad. 
Are you sure you can trust him? 
I think so. 
What do you need, Jack? 
The suspect's on Florence crossing Ormond. 
We believe is ultimately gonna lead us to Fayed but we need Chloe to give us satellite support. 
Loggin' on to the NSA server now. 
Jack, Fayed just contacted the President Palmer and demanded he releases the prisonners we're holding in Palmdale. 
What's the President's position? 
If we don't find Fayed by the 9:00 a.m. deadline 
I believe he'll go through with it. 
This could take me at least 10 min to get satellite coverage. 
I had to send the repositionning orders for the sub server. 
That's too long, the suspects is entering route 7. 
If we try to follow him, he'll see us. 
Chloe, can you speed up access? 
No, the sat queue's overloaded, the entire country's on high alert. 
We'll use CalTrans cameras to track him till the satellite reposition. 
If there was a traffic camera on route 7. 
There isn't, I already looked. 
You're gonna have to figure out another way to track him until we get the satellite up. 
 Where's yout nearest tac team? 
 Curtis has a unit... 
12 miles away. 
Send him in my direction. 
I'll get back to you. 
Do you think this man will recognize you? 
No. What do you have in mind? 
Curtis Manning on com. 
Curtis, I just spoke to Jack. 
He's surveilling one of Fayed's men and needs backup. 
 Where is he? 
 Last known was Florence Blvd near the entrance to Route 7. 
He's running this operation with Assad. 
Did I hear that correctly? 
We're working with Assad? 
Your orders are to rendez-vous with them and lend support. 
All warants on Assad are resended for the time being. Understood? 
Curtis? 
We're on our way. 
Don't get up! 
What's wrong with you? 
I know you saw me coming! 
 It was my right of way! 
 You tell me I don't know how to drive? 
I'm talking to you! 
Hey, you're alright? 
I saw the whole thing. 
Get out of here! 
This is got nothing to do with you. 
I'm a witness! 
You drove straight into him! 
What is it with you, people? 
You're gonna stick up for him? 
Fine. I'll wait here 
until the police arrives. 
Screw both of you. 
Screw you! 
Where are you going? 
Hey, this is your fault! 
I saw his licence for the police. 
I can't wait for the police. 
I can't drive this. 
I need to be somewhere. 
I'll just have to deal with this later. 
Where are you going? 
Newhall. I was getting on route 7. 
I can take you to Newhall, I'll drop you there. Come. 
 Come! 
 Thank you. 
I hope you're not gonna let that bastard get away with this. 
Hit-and-run is a crime. 
You must file a police report. 
I know. 
Come on... 
CTU? 
This is Jack Bauer. 
I need to speak with Bill Buchanan. 
Hold, please. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
Fayed's man is now in a car with Assad. 
What happened? 
The suspect was involved in a traffic incident. 
Listen to me. 
Assad has let his cell phone opened so that we can monitor the call. 
I'm gonna be following roughly 2 miles behind in a white Jeep Cherokee. 
Through conversation with the suspect, Assad'll let us know where he's going. 
I'm ready to transfer you into the car. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
Bill, they cant hear us on their side. 
You should be on call, now. 
I don't know Newhall very well. 
 I need you to guide me, please. 
 I will. 
Nadia, pull* all agency data pour on Newhall, to set up perimeters for a sort. 
Chloe, when you get the satellite, make sure we have coverage of that area. 
Let Curtis know that he is to intercept Jack somewhere on route 7 on the way to Newhall. 
Fayed? 
What is it? 
Our scout is reporting increased activity around the Palmdale military prison. 
The transport buses are starting to arrive. 
Good. 
By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened. 
We still don't have the component. 
We will. 
Ahmed should be on his way to pick it up, now. 
Scott? Is that you? 
Yeah. 
Honey, we were beginning to get worried. 
 My God, Ahmed! What happened? 
 Mom, he has a gun. 
What's going on? 
What is this? Where is Ray? 
Just put the gun down, and... 
 ... tell me what's happening. 
 Call him. 
Ray? 
Yeah. 
What the hell... 
Don't wanna hurt any of you, but I will unless you do exactly what I say. 
You're a nurse, right? 
 You have medical supplies, bandages? 
 Yeah. 
Go get them. 
Now! 
You two... on the couch. 
Now, come on! 
Sit... down! 
Now! 
I need you to patch this leg. 
Stop the bleeding. 
My God, Stan was right. 
You are a terrorist. 
Stan is dead. 
He killed him. 
What? I can't stop this bleeding. 
Don't tell me that you can't! 
The wound's too deep. 
You have muscle tissue damage. 
You need to see a doctor. 
Just bandage it! 
There's a package in there. 
I'm supposed to take it to a man who has an item for me. 
Press. 
Obviously, I can't do that now. 
So, you gonna have to. 
I'm not leaving you alone with my family. 
Your family will be safe when you do what I say. 
When you pick up the item, you'll call me, and I'll give you further instructions. 
What's in this package? 
That's not of your concern. 
You're just making a drop. 
Grab that phone and come here. 
Come here, come here. 
Understand this: if I see anyone... 
police, FBI, anybody outside this house, or if you take too long, your wife and son are dead. 
Do you understand me? Look at me! 
Do you understand me? 
I understand. 
Where am I going? 
There's an address on the front pocket of that backpack. 
It's a man named Marcus. 
Go! 
Curtis, how far away are you? 
Less than five minutes. 
Get there as fast as you can. 
Assad and Fayed's man are on open road. 
They're already five miles ahead. 
Got it. 
 Darling? 
 What? 
Since when do you take Milo's side against me? 
 You're doing him again. 
 I was not, my lovely. 
Your pick on your bosses whenever you get stressed out. 
Milo's not my boss. 
Heaven forbids. 
Well, he might as well be. 
He can bounce you. 
Which is what I think you really want, sometimes. 
And why would I want that? 
I don't know, it's your character form, not mine. 
The files you wanted are all unlocked. 
They'll be on your screen in a minute. 
Good. 
Mr. President? 
I just got off the phone with CTU. 
They reconnected with Jack Bauer. 
Where is he? 
He's following a man he's identified as one of Fayed's operatives. 
CTU is now coordinating support for Jack because they believe this man will lead them to Fayed's location. 
Did CTU offer a time frame for locating Fayed? 
No, sir. At this point, any estimates 
would be premature. 
And did you speak with the Palmdale facility? 
Yes, and the airfield. 
If we wanna meet Fayed's deadline and have these prisoners in the air before the end of the hour, we have to have them on buses and the road within the next 10 minutes. 
If you still want to proceed... 
with that option. 
Listen, Karen. 
I know you disapprove of my decision. 
But unless Jack and CTU call to say they have Fayed, there is no other option here. 
Tell them to load the buses. 
Yes, M. President. 
Sand Canyon Road. 
What? 
I was just remembering. 
I had a friend who lived on Sand Canyon Road. 
We can take the service road from here. 
They're 2 miles ahead of us on the service road. 
We can monitor their direction with their cell phone. 
CTU wants you on com. 
 Copy? 
 10/4. 
 CTU, this is Manning. 
 Go ahead, Curtis. 
Bill, I'm with Jack. 
Do we have satellite access, yet? 
It's coming up. 
Is Jack on the line? 
I'm here, Bill. 
We're redirecting the NSA satellite to the area around Sand Canyon road exit mark. 
As soon as we have a fix on Assad's vehicle we'll upload it to your GPS. 
Copy that. 
Good to see you, Jack. 
I'm sorry for what you're put through. 
I'm glad you're back. 
Now, I have to work with Assad. 
Doesn't that bother you? 
The man's a terrorist, Jack! 
Responsible for taking hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent lives over the past twenty years. 
Doesn't that mean anything to you? 
I don't know what means anything anymore, Curtis. 
I've spend my all life defending this country against people like Assad. 
And now, he's trying to disarm his people, renounce terrorism. 
Playing field has changed. 
And that doesn't change Assad's past. 
We have to make sure that he paies for  the crimes that he's committed. 
He's our only chance at a peaceful resolution of all of this. 
That might not happened. 
Anyway, that's not our call to make. 
We'll see. 
What is that supposed to mean? 
Nothing. 
Good. 
This isn't working. 
There's still too much pain, I need something stronger. 
There are some prescription pain killers in the kitchen. 
Get them. 
And some water. 
Make sure I can see you. 
They are in the cabinet over the TV. 
Give it to me. 
Sit down. 
Sit... down! 
Sit down, sweaty. 
Form an orderly line! 
Head count will be taken. 
Then, and only then, you'll be loaded onto those buses Understand? 
Any problem you cause will only delay this process. 
Get in line! 
I'll tell him. Right. 
It was the FBI. 
Your sister, she's been arrested. 
What? 
 When? 
 Less than an hour ago. 
The FBI agents were sent to the offices of the Islamic American Alliance to serve a warrant for the personnel files. 
Sandra proceeded to delete them right in front of the agents. 
They had no choice but to arrest her. 
Damn it! 
Where is she been taken, Tom? 
She's been detained. 
One of our provisional facilities. 
Walid, I am so sorry, I got you into this. 
I deleted those files. 
It wasn't right for them to arrest to you for my actions. 
You have nothing to apologize for. 
You were protecting the right of innocent Americans. 
It's what this country stand for, even if the government forgot it. 
Back away! 
Move back. 
Come on! 
You take him. 
Where are you taking him? 
Walid! 
I'll be alright. 
Over here, Ms. Palmer. 
Take-off her cuffs. 
For you. 
I'll be right here. 
Please hold for the President... 
What were you thinking, deleting those files? 
I was standing-up to unlawful seizure. 
You making a point, is the last thing I need today. 
I have ordered your release. 
Agents are waiting outside. 
with instructions to take you back home. 
I don't want to be released, Wayne. 
I want to fight this. 
Bring attention to the civil liberties that you administration has allowed to be violated. 
Do you have any idea what's going on today? 
Of course I do. 
Innocent people are dying all over the country and you choose now to make a civil right case out of this. 
Well, somebody has to! 
Look, if you gonna release anybody, it should be Walid. 
Walid is the head of an organization under investigation. 
Now, the FBI just wants to hold him until it can be determined what was in those files you deleted. 
There is nothing increminating on those files. 
Wayne, you have my word. 
Walid is innocent! 
The Walid has nothing to worry about, Sandra. 
Listen... 
I don't have time for this. 
You are released. 
Go home, I will call you later. 
I need to speak to Walid before I leave here. 
That's not going to happen. 
I'm his attorney, you have to give access to him. 
Don't tell me what I have to do, Ms. Palmer, 
I'm following orders. 
Walid has rights! 
Limited rights, Ms. Palmer. 
He's been held under the revised ennemy combatant statute. 
Applying this statute to somebody like him is ridiculous. 
Is the law just been completely thrown through the windows? 
When you're through the lectures, I have orders to drive you home. 
Ma'am. 
Stay to the left. 
Once inside the secure zone, you will disrobe. 
After a cavity search, we will giving back your clothing. 
Sir, you have to keep moving. 
I don't care. 
I'm innocent. 
I want to talk to somebody, an authority. 
We're not gonna ask you again. 
Hey, don't touch me! 
Let him alone! 
Sir, get back in line! 
Not until you will let go that man! 
Take your hands of me! 
Take him to interrogation. 
Do you live around here? 
No. 
Visiting relatives? 
Why are you asking? 
I need to make sure you can get back to your car. 
 I'll be okay. 
 "I'll be okay." 
My son is as this. 
He has a memory like a fish. 
His mother is very worried. 
At the next corner, make a right. 
Then drop me off at the end of the street. 
Did you copy that? 
It's the sixty five hundred block of Alderton. 
Bring out the data on all commercial and restaurant buildings within an half mile and then begin a free sort. 
You mean like I'm doing already? 
Right over here. 
 Alright, thanks again for your help. 
 Please, it's nothing. 
He's cross the sixty fourth road headed towards the commercial district. 
 I'm turning around. 
 Here he is. 
We've acquired the suspect on satellite. 
Curtis, have your men setup a moving perimeter. 
Carrier, take him at across exit port road, setup a moving perimeter behind the target. 
He'll be well trained be carefull. 
My men know their job. 
 Do I know you? 
 No... 
 but I know you. 
 Subject entering a commercial building one block south of where you are. 
Copy that. 
Borman, we're gonna take Assad with us. 
Keep him on a close watch searching for weapons. 
Curtis, Assad is a part of this operation. 
Not anymore. 
Wait, wait. 
I'll take care of it as soon as this is over. 
I promise. 
Thank you. 
The building is a self storage facility. 
14 200 units. 
Borman, keep him here. 
 Team leader, do you copy? 
 Go ahead, Carrier. 
I can see two dozen cases of amunition Boxes with czech writing. 
Bill, this is a dead drop, Fayed's not here. 
We only have a few minutes, Jack. 
If the suspect is not going to lead us to Fayed, in order to stop the prisoners exchange, we have to move in now. 
Get the information through interrogation. 
Bill, that's too risky. 
We have no guarantee we can make him talk in time. 
That's a risk we have to take. 
Curtis, move your men into position. 
Understood. 
All teams, we're moving in. 
Stealth approach, none lethal force. 
Come where I can see you. 
Step out with you hands up. 
Everyone's back! 
Boggey*** the nurse fire hall.**** 
Get the fire department of LA here, now! 
Bill, it's Jack, suspect is dead. 
He was taking a laptop out of this storage unit. 
We'll check the hardrive but it has been badly damaged. 
Understood Jack, I need the President. 
That's a feed of the prisoners in Palmdale. 
Yes. 
Mr. President, I have Bill Buchanan 
on the line for you. 
 Put him on. 
 Yes, sir. 
Mr President, we got a set back to our operation. 
 What happened, Bill? 
 The suspect Jack was following chose to kill himself rather than be apprehended. 
We're examining the area for evidence but there is no telling how long it will take or if it will lead us to Fayed, sir, I'm sorry. 
So am I. 
 Keep me informed. 
 Of course. 
Mr President if you intend on following through with this prisoner release, we wait orders. 
Load them on the plane. 
This is Lennox. 
The President has made is decision: load the prisoners on the plane. 
Head counts is correct and all men are accounted for on bus three. 
I want confirmed head counts on all other vehicules. 
Copy that. Bus 1 confirmed. 
Roger that. 
We will proceed single file and in orderly man onto the plane. 
There will be no mistakes, and no disorder. 
Is that clear? 
Let's get this buses out of here as soon as we can. 
 Let's move. 
 Yes, sir. 
We've just heard from the airport. 
Our people are beiing loaded on to the plane. 
The President has giving in to us. 
Hello. 
Back here. 
 You're Marcus. 
 Who are you? 
I'm supposed to give this to you. 
And your supposed to give me something in return. 
That's not enough. 
What do you mean? 
Component cost me a little more than I though it would. 
I need another 50.000. 
But that's all he gave me. 
Well, go back and get the rest. 
I can't do that. 
Look, I need whatever it is you're selling, please. 
Just... 
take the money. I am begging you. 
Until you get more money, we got nothing more to talk about. 
 Can I use your phone? 
 Yeah. 
He wants another 50.000 dollars. 
Tell him you don't have it. 
I did... 
and he said to come back when I get it. 
Listen to me. 
There is no more money, I don't care what you have to do, but you have to get that item from him. 
Do you understand what happens here if you don't, right ? 
Yeah, I understand. 
 What did he say. 
 Well, he say that I'll get the money. 
And, before, you know I bring it back here, he just want us to make sure you really have it. 
There it is. 
Son of a bitch. 
I'll kill you... 
Shut up and just take the money, just take it. 
OK, Jack, the hardrive is mostly toasted, but i was able to recover the most recently accessed files. 
Some kind of wiring schematic how much of the file to we have. 
About a page and a half mostly in arabic, some of it in russian. 
Get Assad over here now. 
Borman. 
Bring him. 
Do you know what this is? 
This is a list of electronic components. 
You have specifications, programing instructions for a detonator. 
But... 
this... 
is for a nuclear device. 
Is it even possible that Fayed could have acquired a nuclear weapon? 
My organisation has tryed unsuccesfully in the past. 
It's possible he may have found a way. 
Son of a bitch. 
You know about that all along... 
Curtis, get off of him now. 
Assad, please. 
There is a reference file at the bottom of the page. 
Softel 3. 
That's a compact bomb the soviets made in the late eighties. 
 It refer to the suitecase nuke. 
 Are they all accounted for? 
Officialy they were all destroyed, but there was a claim that one device was deverted to a nuclear scientist who's suspected terrorist ties. 
He call's himself Saif-al-Din. 
Looking up his file now. 
There won't be much, Saif-al-Din is a code name, it mean: "sword of the faith." 
intel just never discover his identity. 
Jack, we have one surveillance photo, it's about 6 years old Put it up. 
 Do you recognize him? 
 Yes. 
I saw him with Fayed a year ago. 
His name is Numair, Hasan Numair. 
 Did you copy that? 
 Looking up his name. 
We need to know where this man is now. 
I think we already do. 
Hasan Numair is a terrorist being release from the Palmdale military prison. 
Get on the phone the white house. 
Chloe bring up the feed on the airfield. 
This is what Fayed has been planning all along. 
This bombings where designed to make you free this man. 
Son of a bitch. 
Chloe, have they freed the prisoners yet? 
No, they're on the plane and there'll be 2 min before they're in the air. 
Give me the CO of the airfield, send it to my office. 
Nadia, tell the President I'm stopping the release. 
That is Nadia Yassir from CTU. 
I need to speak with The President, priority three. 
This is Bill Buchanan. The prisoner 
you're looking for is Hasan Numair. 
I'm sending his picture to your PDA. 
Roger that. 
Prisoner Numair, raise your hand. 
I've got the photo. 
Copy that. 
Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now. 
We need to go over every square inch of this plane. 
Someone let the sergent know, he needs to get up here now. 
Hurry up. 
Fayed is waiting for you. 
Bomb! 
(explosion thunders) Vice President Daniels is running this country now. 
He will implement your security plan. 
Agent Lowry, these men are responsible for the attempted assassination of the president. 
WOMAN:  I have the Vice President  calling for Mr. Buchanan. 
DANIELS:  Bill, I see  from the White House flashes that President Palmer granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough. 
Logan claims he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko. 
DANIELS:  How? 
BUCHANAN:  Through the Russian consulate  in Los Angeles. 
LOGAN: The bomb that exploded this morning was a Russian suitcase nuclear device supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko. 
 Where is he? 
I don't know. 
(phone ringing) Yes? 
MARKOV: The United States has connected you with terrorists. 
The reason we brought the Arabs into this was to conceal our involvement. 
Now we are exposed. 
Russia is exposed. 
Jack, you just spent nearly two years in a Chinese prison because you violated the sovereignty of their consulate. 
Now you plan to go back into the Russian consulate and take a chance on that happening again?! 
BAUER:  How do I find Gredenko?! 
M-Mojave Desert. 
Shadow Valley. 
What is he doing? 
Launching drones. 
How soon will the drones be ready? 
In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air. 
Now! 
I've got to set the transcript codes for the debrief. 
Thank you. 
Who are you? 
I'm just Chloe O'Brian. 
I-I need to do something on this computer. 
Do you know what's going on with Jack Bauer? 
As far as I know, he's still being held in the Russian consulate. 
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan right now. 
He'll be here after his meeting. 
Does he know that I'm all alone here in a holding cell? 
This isn't really a cell, and you're hardly alone. 
This is standard procedure for someone who's under house arrest. 
Excuse me? 
Sorry. 
I-I'm feeling ambivalent. 
I'm gonna go. 
All right, I want to introduce everyone to Mike Doyle. 
He's the new head of Field Ops, just in from Fort Bragg. 
I want all tactical and comm agents to report to him directly. 
Jack Bauer's currently being held captive in the Russian consulate. 
I haven't opened up that information to anyone on the outside. 
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate. 
MILO: So, we're permitted to provoke an international incident just to liberate one of our own operatives? 
No. Liberating Jack 
is a secondary goal. 
Our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul. Now, 
according to Jack, Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the remaining three suitcase nukes. 
Excuse me, but is nobody worried that this could be considered an act of war against the Russians? 
BUCHANAN: Ultimately, it's the vice president's decision if we go in or not. 
But, if Jack is right, and Markov is working with Gredenko, the Russians will have to back down. 
Sir, Logan is ready for you. 
Thank you. 
I want a comprehensive siege profile on my desk ASAP. 
Who has the control keys for the main servers? 
Uh, I do. 
Okay, bracket the scenarios into three. 
I want projected outcomes based on different levels of personnel. 
MILO: Doyle, normally, we run general attack assessment first, then if there's any... 
I don't care what you normally do, Pressman. 
And I wasn't speaking to you. 
I was talking with her. 
MILO: Yeah, that's so weird, 'cause I had this thought that you might come here and not be a jerk, like you were in Denver, but you are. 
That's right. 
Just like Denver. 
Let's get to work. 
I take it you know him? 
Yeah. 
I don't like him very much. 
Does he know what he's doing? 
Yeah, he's good. 
What did Buchanan say? 
We're ready to move on the consulate, pending White House approval. 
Is Jack on his own? 
Yeah. 
This is all about getting Markov, not saving Jack. 
Yeah? 
I'm terminating the American. 
Do you confirm? 
Yes. 
And you're sure there won't be any political complications? 
Not if we stick to our story. 
The American kills our head of security, tries to escape. 
The American has shot Vasili. 
He's in the basement. 
Find him! 
AGENT: Consul Markov? 
Yes. 
We haven't found the American, but I locked down the perimeter. 
There is no way to leave the building. 
He can't be allowed to call out. 
Shut down the phone lines, DSL, everything. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Morris, it's Jack. 
I know how to find Gredenko. 
He's in the... 
(dial tone) Morris? 
Jack? Jack? Jack! 
(dial tone) Come on! 
Damn it! 
Sir, Morris just got a call from Jack. 
The line went dead before he could finish, but he says he knows where Gredenko is. 
Did he trace the call? 
He's still inside the consulate. 
All right, monitor everything in case he calls back, and tell Doyle Bauer's got key intel, and is no longer dispensable. 
Got it. 
I'm sorry. 
We're going to have to reschedule our debrief. 
Why? 
We have an immediate situation at the Russian consulate. 
Does this have something to do with Bauer going back in there to question Markov? 
Please, Bill. 
Maybe I can help. 
Jack was able to get Grendenko's location from Markov. 
He tried to call us, but was cut off before he could say more. 
He's either being held prisoner in the consulate, or he's being pursued. 
Then I was right. 
Markov is involved. 
And he will do whatever it takes to keep Jack quiet. 
We have to extricate Jack, and failing that, we have to go in and remove Markov and interrogate him ourselves. 
We don't have time to go through the red tape. 
There's not gonna be any red tape. 
I'm launching an assault team. 
No, that's... that 
is a huge mistake. 
Markov will not let himself be taken alive, and he will kill Jack Bauer. 
We have to try something. 
We're running out of options. 
Have you tried any pressure from the top? 
From-From President Suvarov? 
Vice President Daniels has spoken to Suvarov. 
He's reluctant to act. 
It's a diplomatic standoff. 
He needs to be convinced to get involved. 
I don't know how to do that. 
I do. 
How? 
My ex-wife, Martha. 
She became friends with the Suvarovs, especially the wife. 
Anya can get through to Yuri. 
He listens to her. 
They're a very good team. 
Um, with all due respect, hasn't Mrs. Logan 
been institutionalized? 
That's beside the point. 
She's in a unique position to help us. 
All right. I'll-I'll... 
put a call in to her. 
Bill, let me do it. 
Martha can be very difficult. 
I think it would be best if I talked to her. 
I didn't realize you were on speaking terms. 
We're not, but I think I can get through to her. 
I know I can. 
Please, let me try. 
That's the way I want it. 
How many on each of those teams? 
Five. 
Okay, make it three. 
More teams, more area covered. 
Fine. 
Who's estimating the consulate defense figures? 
That would be me. 
Where are the numbers? 
I'm just sorting them before I put them out. 
Of course you are. 
Where are the numbers? 
Oh, I see. This is 
about whether or not it takes eight seconds or ten seconds. 
There are your numbers sorted three ways. Pick one. 
Hey! 
Do I have your attention? 
'Cause I only want to do this once. 
I have 25 soldiers that are about to put their asses on the line. 
Whether they live or die largely depends on what gets done here. 
That's not to mention the larger threat of three nuclear weapons that may be down the street, for all we know. 
So, if anyone has a problem taking orders from me without giving me lip, tell me now, and I will have you reassigned. 
Doyle. 
You keep your hands off my people. 
Is that clear? 
DOYLE: They need to understand what I expect from them. 
MILO: I know what you expect. 
That's all that matters. 
You have a problem with somebody on my team, you come to me. 
Fair enough. 
Have your "team" merge their results and download it onto my system. 
You all right? 
The shirt's a blend; it doesn't wrinkle. 
You know what I mean. 
Yes. 
I am all right. 
I thought I was a pain in the ass. 
The Vice President likes you, Tom. 
He hopes you have the right answer for him. 
Well, I hope so, too. 
Tom Lennox, man of the hour. 
It's all right. 
You can leave us alone. 
So, have you given any thought to our earlier conversation? 
Yes, I have, sir. 
And? 
And I agree that the priority here is to protect our country. 
And I am prepared to look the other way regarding details of the assassination plot. 
To a point. 
Well, what does that mean? 
It means the truth must ultimately come out. 
Reed and Carson need to be punished for what they did. 
And they will. 
Look, all I'm trying to do is keep America united. 
I can't have our critics screaming, "Look at how bad we are. 
We're worse than the terrorists." 
We need to keep our eye on the ball right now. 
And on that point, sir, we are in complete agreement. 
Good, because I need you to tell the ambassador of Assad's country that you saw Assad plant the bomb that injured the president. 
Sir, looking the other way is one thing, choosing to tell a lie to the ambassador, that becomes a matter of record. 
Now, you listen to me: If we expect to navigate through this crisis, I need you to cooperate. 
Yes, and I would like to cooperate. 
I'm still talking! 
Come on, now, Tom, let's just count our blessings here for a minute. 
President Palmer survived this awful attack. 
And neither you nor I had anything to do with this heinous plot to kill him. 
And the most beautiful fact of all is that we now have the opportunity to implement the correct policy to stop these terrorist lunatics. 
Can you just put aside your distaste  for my methods for one minute... 
and think about the great gift that's been given to us. 
I will think long and hard, sir. 
Good. 
Now, I need you to tell the ambassador that Assad carried in the bomb. 
I'll take it from there. 
(chuckles): Okay? 
Okay. 
Lisa, get the ambassador clearance and bring him down here. 
Let DOJ know that Lennox has been cleared of any wrongdoing and will continue serving as Chief of Staff. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) Sir, I would like to know what you hope to achieve in your talk with the ambassador. 
I want him to know that I hold his country responsible for all of it the nuke and the presidential assassination attempt. 
They need to be motivated to reign in these terrorists. 
And I want them to know that America is mad as hell and ready to retaliate Here's Fayed. 
It's about time he got here. 
We need to start loading the bombs. 
Mr. Vice President. 
Bill, you're on speaker. 
I'm here with Tom Lennox. 
What's going on at the Russian consulate? 
Jack Bauer's still at large and somewhere inside. 
It appears he now also knows Gredenko's location, but isn't able to get it to us. 
All right, then what's the plan? 
Former President Logan believes he can convince his ex-wife to put a call into Anya Suvarov. 
He thinks the Russian First Lady can get through to her husband. 
(chuckles) That's about as likely as the terrorists knocking on my door and surrendering. 
I agree. 
That's why we've also prepared a siege plan. 
A strike force will enter the consulate and extract Markov for interrogation. 
You realize an attack on a Russian consulate is technically an act of war. 
I do, sir. 
Frankly, I'm reluctant to go the tactical route here. 
We got our hands full with these terrorists, we don't need to open up another front with the Russians. 
Of course, it's your decision, sir. 
I understand the politics are sticky, but my responsibility is to stop these nukes. 
Markov will not surrender willingly. 
We have to go in. 
How long will it take you to put together this siege? 
About 20 minutes. 
All right. 
Proceed as if you're going in. 
If Logan can be effective before then, great.. 
but don't wait on him. 
Yes, sir. 
You ready? 
Yes. 
All right, take your team to their first location, and await our word. 
Got it. 
Martha, I'm back. 
Did you get some rest? 
I've been worried about you. 
Worried about me? 
You shouldn't be out driving around with all that fallout in the air. 
Well, I'm keeping a good distance away. 
How are you? 
Well, I've decided to read my book and listen to music. 
I've lived with enough fear over the years. 
I don't need anymore. 
Good for you. 
Got your magazines. 
Thank you. 
And I stopped by Mel's. 
(gasps) Did you get raspberries? 
(gasps) And blackberries and fresh kiwi. 
Oh, oh, thank God for Mel. 
What would I do without that man's produce? 
Oh, these look beautiful. 
Mmm. 
Ooh, here-- have one. 
I'm fine. 
Come on. 
Hmm? 
Can you get that? 
Martha Logan's bungalow. 
May I speak to Martha, please? 
Who is this? 
It's Charles, Aaron. 
Please put her on; it's important. 
Hold on. 
Who is it? 
It's Charles. 
He says it's important. 
Important to whom? 
Mr. Logan, she doesn't want 
to talk to you. 
I heard what she said. 
Look, listen to me, I'm in CTU in Los Angeles. 
I'm here on government business and it has to do with the nuclear attack. 
I don't understand how Martha could possibly be of any help. 
What you understand really doesn't matter. 
I no longer have to tolerate your sarcasm. 
Please, this was not sarcasm. 
Something needs to be done. 
And, and I think that Martha might be able to help. 
I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Logan, 
but Martha simply doesn't want to speak with you. 
She hasn't taken your calls in almost two years. 
I don't know why you think she would now. 
Tell her it's about the Suvarovs. 
What? 
Just do it. 
Please. 
Martha, he wants to ask you... 
I told you. 
I don't want to talk to him. 
It's about the Suvarovs. 
What's wrong? 
Did something happen? 
I don't know. 
(sighs) What is it? 
Is Anya okay? 
Anya's fine, Martha. 
They're both fine. 
Then what the hell do you want? 
It's a very delicate matter. 
There's an international incident brewing and I think that you might be able to help defuse it. 
Let me get this straight: The government is desperate so they come to you to fix the world... 
and, uh, then you come to me. 
I can't be dragged in another drama, with you Charles. 
I won't. 
You know what's going on today, Martha. 
You know that this is important! 
This is absurd. 
You still there? 
Yes, I'm still here. 
Aaron, you know I wouldn't be playing games on a day like today. 
I know. 
You need to convince her to see me. 
I'm going to take a chopper to you and I'll be there in a few minutes. 
Aaron? 
All right. 
This is Shavers. 
BUCHANAN: Stan, let me talk to Logan. 
Sir, it's Mr. Buchanan. 
Yes, Bill? 
We've dispatched personnel to prepare for an assault on the Russian consulate. 
Bill, attacking the consulate is a huge error in judgment. 
This has been decided. 
The only way to avoid full-out confrontation with the Russians is for you can get Martha to make the call before we engage. 
(woman speaks Russian, then giggles) (man speaks Russian, woman laughs) Slowly... 
both of you against the wall. 
Please don't hurt her. 
I have no intention of hurting either of you. 
But if you don't cooperate, I will kill you. 
You understand me? 
Both of you speak English? 
Yes. 
I need to make an outside call. 
You can't. 
They've cut all communications from the building because you killed Stovich. 
I didn't kill Stovich. 
I don't believe you. 
I don't have to convince you. 
We'll do whatever you want. 
In case of an emergency, how do you contact the outside world? 
Please, there's a SATCOM phone upstairs. 
Get it and bring it down here. 
We're in the middle of a lockdown. 
That's your problem. 
Get me that phone. 
Now! 
Okay. 
Get against the desk. 
Don't be scared. 
You'll be fine. 
Hello, Aaron. 
Martha's waiting for you. 
She's inside. 
Thank you. 
Martha? 
I'll get her. 
What's the matter? 
Apparently she's changed her mind. 
I'm sorry, but she doesn't want to see you. 
Aaron... 
you have to convince her that this is not about us. 
This is for the good of the country. 
I told her that. 
Look, if we don't do something in the next few minutes, there's going to be a U.S. 
led assault on the Russian consulate here in Los Angeles. 
On top of everything else, we will effectively be at war with Russia. 
MARTHA: You've lost weight. 
Martha. 
So this is the new, improved Charles Logan. 
Reborn. 
You look beautiful. 
What do you want? 
I need you to call Anya Suvarov. 
What do you want me to say to her? 
She has to convince Yuri to order the Russian Consul General, here in Los Angeles, to surrender himself. 
And why would he do that? 
Because the man his name is Anatoly Markov he's a criminal and he's working outside of Russian authority. 
So what? 
He's also a mass murderer. 
The bomb that went off this morning in Valencia was supplied to the terrorists with Markov's help. 
There are other bombs out there. 
He knows where they are. 
Why doesn't the White House just contact Yuri directly? 
They did. It didn't work. 
Why not? 
Martha, this is very complicated. 
Please don't make me explain everything in details we don't have much time. 
Oh, oh, oh... 
I'm sorry; just do what you say without asking. 
I'm sorry. 
You haven't changed a bit. 
Look at this. Look at this! 
I'm still under arrest. 
After this is over, I go back to prison. 
I'm just trying to help. 
Prison? 
Is that what you call a 10,000-square-foot house with a swimming pool and tennis court? 
Yuri has to be convinced that this man Markov  is a traitor to his country. 
Anya can make our case for us. 
You're the only person who can reach her fast. 
Do you think I should do this? 
Yes, I do. 
I need a drink. 
(tense, wry laugh) Not that knocking me off the wagon would be a small price to pay for saving the world. 
Get Anya on the phone. 
NADIA: How far are you from the Russian consulate? 
We'll be there in a few minutes. 
Has there been any change of plans? 
No. 
As far as I know, the assault on the consulate is still a go. 
I'm about to talk to Buchannan now. 
Call me if anything changes. 
Okay. 
Have a seat, Mr. Ambassador. 
Thank you. 
How is President Palmer? 
Well... 
The President's a tough man. 
He's injured, but we're confident he'll make a full recovery. 
What a tragic and despicable act. 
I agree. 
What makes it even more troubling is that a citizen of your country, Hamri Al-Assad, was responsible for the assassination attempt. 
I understand that Assad lost his life in the blast. 
But I was led to believe that he was working with President Palmer to promote a peace plan. 
Well, I'm afraid that was all a ruse, Mr. Ambassador. 
Assad's real intentions became clear when he detonated the explosive. 
You have proof of this? 
Conclusive. 
Forensic evidence, as well as at least one eyewitness who saw the detonator in Assad's hand immediately before the explosion. 
Isn't that right, Tom? 
Yes, sir, that is correct. 
Even if what you say is true, you must know that Hamri Al-Assad was not working at the behest of our government. 
He was as much a wanted man in our country as he was in yours. 
Oh, not as much. 
But that's gonna change. 
What are you referring to? 
The terrorists presently on U.S. soil are acting 
under the orders of citizens in your country who have the support of your government. 
I know it and you know it. 
That is simply not true. 
I say it is. 
And I'm willing to bet you that I'm right. 
What do you mean? 
I have a carrier group within striking distance of every major city in your country, waiting for me to give the order. 
You would attack us? 
Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country, enters the United States and detonates a nuclear bomb, killing thousands. 
Next, Assad attempts to assassinate the president. 
We cannot be held responsible. 
You know fully well that we have cooperated with you since the inception of this crisis. 
These threats against us are reckless and counterproductive. 
I had an understanding with your president. 
And now you're going to have one with me. 
You help us find those nukes before another goes off... 
or I'm going to unleash the full power of our military on your country. 
All right, keep me posted. 
Doyle is approaching the staging area. 
We can in the consulate in less than 15 minutes. 
It's going to come right down to the wire. 
What do you mean? 
Charles, Logan and I are trying to arrange a phone call between his ex-wife Martha and Anya Suvarov. 
When? 
Mrs. Suvarov's giving a speech 
right now in Omsk. 
We have to wait till she's finished. 
Even if Mrs. Logan can 
get through to Anya, it's going to take her some time to convince her husband to change his mind. 
I agree. 
It's a long shot. 
It shouldn't take much longer. 
LOGAN: I don't understand. 
This is important. 
Why don't they just interrupt her speech? 
It's Russian politics. 
There's nothing we can do. 
Fine. 
It's gonna be a few more minutes. 
PIERCE: What's the matter, hon? 
This is taking forever. 
I know. 
Aaron... you promise 
you'll stand by me, even if I can't go through with this? 
Of course I will. 
Martha, I'm sorry. 
The last thing I wanted to do was upset you. 
Funny, you always manage to get to that last thing. 
Let me ask you something, Charles. 
Does it bother you to see me with another man? 
Martha, please. 
We may as well talk to fill the time. 
We never really had any closure. 
Well? 
Yes. It's very difficult. 
If you want to know the truth. 
But you've had a rebirth. 
You should be happy for my happiness. 
I am happy for you, Martha. 
I'm sure you are. 
You know, Charles, Aaron has taken such good care of me. 
I don't know what I did to deserve such a good man. 
I never knew what that was before. 
A really good man. 
Martha, if it makes you feel better to insult me, please feel free. 
I didn't come here to fight with you. 
It does make me feel better. 
I can say exactly I want, finally, without having to worry about incurring your wrath. 
The great Charles Logan. 
The President of the Universe. 
The great leader. 
The murderer. 
Martha, I want you to stop this right now. 
You're going to get all stirred up. 
Oh, well, God, we couldn't have that, could we? 
(knife clatters) Mr. Logan, 
if you'd be more comfortable waiting outside, I'd understand. 
I appreciate that, Aaron, but I think I'll stay right here. 
Actually, I'm very thankful that you've been able to be here for Martha. 
You are a good man. 
She's very lucky to have you. 
Now you're trying to irritate me, aren't you? 
No, Martha, no. 
I'm not. 
Oh, cut the crap. 
With the sincerity, the new enlightened soul. 
At least you used to be an honest crook. 
PIERCE: That's enough. 
Please. 
Sorry. 
I'll be a good little girl. 
(Martha yells) Oh, my God. 
We need a medic in here right now! 
He just wouldn't stop and I, oh, oh... 
Oh, my God, what did I do? 
You must've hit an artery. 
Agent Foley, get in here now! 
Somebody, come on! 
Martha, look what you've done! 
MEDIC: He's going in to shock. 
Let's get him out of here. 
Now. 
PIERCE: It happened too fast, Bill. 
I couldn't stop her. 
BUCHANAN: There's nothing we can do about it, Aaron. 
Right now, I've been ordered by the vice president to send an assault team into the Russian consulate, unless President Suvarov intercedes. 
I understand. 
Is Martha capable of having a coherent conversation with Anya Suvarov? 
Honestly, I don't know. 
Chloe's putting the call through any second. Find out. 
Will do. 
Why are they doing this to me? 
I should be given a medal. 
He was one of the biggest criminals in history. 
They gave him house arrest. 
Martha, we're still in a crisis situation. 
Are you able to handle a conversation with Anya Suvarov? 
Of course, I am. 
I'm not crazy. 
I know what the stakes are. 
Are you sure? 
AGENT: Mr. Pierce, 
CTU's got Anya Suvarov on the line for Mrs. Logan. 
They're putting it through now. 
Do you know what you're going to say? 
Anya, it's Martha. 
How are you? 
I'm fine. 
I've been worried about you there in California. 
Stop worrying; everything's gonna be fine. 
I know we have a lot to catch up on, but I'm going to have to be rude and get right to the point. 
There's not a lot of time. 
What is it? 
If you've talked to Yuri recently, you know there's a very tense situation going on at the Russian consulate in Los Angeles. 
I've heard something about that, but don't know the details. 
The details are very important, Anya. 
Please, tell me more. 
The Americans stepped on Russian soil and took me hostage. 
We will sort out the details later. 
Right now, I am ordering you to surrender to the Americans and deliver Jack Bauer, unharmed. 
I am afraid... 
I cannot do that, Mr. President. 
How dare you disobey a direct order. 
You will do exactly as I tell you! 
(phone beeps off) Mr. Buchanan, 
Consul Markov is not cooperating. 
You understand, Mr. President, 
this leaves me with very few options. 
I do. 
I will personally authorize the use of force against the consulate. 
The United States of America has the support of the Russian state in this matter. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(phone beeps off) I got it. 
Get over here. 
Is anybody gonna notice this missing? 
In a few minutes, yes. 
Make your call. 
Did he hurt you? 
No. 
(phone beeps) It needs the unlock code. 
Get down. 
(chamber clicks) BUCHANAN (on phone): Doyle, Suvarov just gave us the go-ahead. 
DOYLE (quietly): Go! 
(chamber clicks) (gun clatters) Are you hit? 
No. 
(phone ringing) Yes? 
It's Markov. 
The Americans are coming in. 
I thought you had that under control. 
No. Won't be long 
(distant gunfire) before they have your position. 
Hold them off as long as you can. 
I will. 
But you must launch now. 
Drop your weapon! 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
This man needs medical attention. They're not hostiles. 
Okay, send medics to the basement. I'm Mike Doyle. 
You need to contact Bill Buchanan. 
Tell him that Fayed and Gredenko are in the Shadow Valley. 
Patch me in with Buchanan. 
This drone is ready to launch. 
Arm the bomb. 
Got it. 
Put all the satellite coverage we have on Shadow Valley. 
Sir, stay still. 
We'll have you to the hospital in a minute. 
Martha... 
Sir, please don't try to talk. 
He's starting to crash. 
We're losing him. 
proudly presents 24 Season 6 EP 7 I need karen hayes to go away. 
I understand,sir. 
I need the president to sign off on my proposals. 
She's gone from being an irritant to an obstacle. 
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence, and your covering it up. 
I did nothing illegal or incorrect. 
Your resignation within the hour. 
Mr.President,I am tendering my resignation. 
Is there anything I can do to change your mind? 
No,sir,there is not. 
Walid has earned their trust. 
These men know something  about the bombs that we don'T. 
I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone. 
They're not terrorists. 
I'm getting walid the hell out of there. 
You spied on us? 
You're worse than they are! 
Son of a bitch! 
a nuclear bomb just went off,like, 25  miles from here. 
When I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country. 
Have you found an engineer? 
I told you I'd find someone and I will. 
It's just taking longer. 
start talking,gray! 
I made a mess. 
Dad's trying to clean it up. 
What happened? 
I hired mccarthy to oversee the job,but... 
so the nukes that these terrorist are in possession of, including the one that was just detonated in valencia, was supplied by mccarthy and stolen from you. 
Yes. 
I'm heading to mccarthy's office in simi valley. 
We have teams standing by. 
Let me know. 
Stop. 
He's my son. 
What are you doing here,jack? 
Jack: I know what you're trying to cover up,dad. 
Gray already told me. 
Mccarthy's not here. 
Hey,what are you doing? 
Put the gun down! 
You work for me. 
No,dad,he doesn'T. 
You don't think I'd let you run loose without keeping an eye on you,do you? 
This is insane. 
******** I am at the edge of the safe zone. 
Behind me is the nuclear blast. 
Emergency medical teams are being overwhelmed by the number of injured. 
In what president palmer has confirmed was a tactical nuclear weapon detonated just a little over two hours ago in this valencia neighborhood north of los angeles, more than 12,000 people are estimated to have perished in the blast. 
Lapd is spread thin,but on an encouraging note, we've heard that they are receiving a flood... 
I just heard about karen's resignation. 
I'm sorry for the loss. 
Are you really sorry,tom? 
Because your words seemed somewhat hollow to me. 
It's no secret karen and i butted heads the last few weeks. 
Nevertheless,I respected her as an adversary. 
She never gave me a concrete reason why she resigned, but there was something... 
something she wasn't telling me. 
This may have something to do with it. 
This is a draft of the executive order I presented this morning. 
Karen found out I was going to resubmit it to you for your authorization. 
And so she quit? 
That makes absolutely no sense to me,tom. 
She's never been afraid of a fight. 
maybe she finally realized her arguments are invalid and that this is the only possible response to the danger we're facing. 
You want to tell me why I would sign off on something that I rejected six hours ago? 
Because,sir,six hours ago, we didn't know fayed had nukes. 
Even so,tom,you're talking about suspending habeas corpus, extending the length and broadening the criteria for those detention centers. 
Those actions will constitute a brazen abuse of executive power. 
Those actions will degrade fayed's network, limiting his ability to make use of these remaining nuclear weapons. 
Sir,fayed's sole intention here is the destruction of our country, its infrastructure,social order, entire way of life,and he's got the will and means to make good on that threat. 
Tom,have you stopped to think about the fact I would be forcing the people who elected me to give up the rights and freedoms that define the essence of this country? 
Sir,if one more nuke goes off, it would have been fayed who's redefined our country. 
Pass this out to the cabinet. 
We'll convene in 30 minutes. 
You're doing the right thing,mr.President. 
Reed. 
Call the cabinet in for an emergency session. 
Tell general white we're ramping up. 
Does that mean the president is signing off on this? 
He wouldn't convene the cabinet unless he was. 
Good work,reed. 
Well,I'm just doing what needs to be done,sir. 
Getting rid of karen is distinctly unpleasant, but she left us no choicE. 
hayes. 
Girl,I'm sorry I'm late with the briefing. 
Tell the president we're still tracking fayed through mccarthy. 
Bill,I've just had to resign. 
Resign?What are you talking about? 
Can't get into it right now, but I've asked to be reassigned to cut as an on-site liaison. 
Karen,you can't leave the president today, of all days. 
Bill,do you think that I would do this if I had any other choice? 
Lennox has something to do with this,doesn't he? 
I cannot talk about this right now. 
I will see you in a few hours.Okay? 
Karen? 
mr.Buchanan. 
What is it,chloe? 
I've been trying to reach jack on his cell phone; he's not answering. 
Try his backup teams. 
I tried; they're not answering either. 
Maybe he had them all go dark. 
He wouldn't do that without telling us first. 
Send in the support units,see if they can get a visual. 
All right. 
And keep trying jack. 
****** So after we're done,where do you want us to meet you? 
I'll be here another hour dumping hard drives. 
We'll meet you back at the house,then. 
Just make sure it goes exactly according to plan. 
Don't worry. 
It's my job to worry. 
it was all for you,jack. 
Everything I worked for,everything I built it was all for you. 
After you left,I tried to convince myself that graem was capable of heading the family... 
protecting the company I guess, on some level,I always knew the truth about him. 
I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself. 
I don't know what you want me to say. 
I want you to understand that after you left,graem was all I had. 
I pushed you away,didn't I? 
I'm really sorry. 
get out. 
Come on. 
Don't do this,sir. 
Whatever graem's paying you,I'll double it. 
Just keep it moving. 
Get down on your knees,both of you. 
No. 
You son of a bitch. 
At least have the guts to look me in the eye. 
I needed to question him. 
They were gonna kill us,jack. 
Search his pockets for the keys. 
Damn it! 
***** Bill,it's jack. 
Jack,we haven't been able to reach you. 
Are you all right? 
Yeah,I'm fine,but all the members of the backup team have been killed. 
Have you found mccarthy? 
Not yet,but I know how to get to hiM. 
How? 
My brother. 
You said your brother wasn't involved when mccarthy brokered the nukes. 
He lied to mE. 
He didn't tell us everything. 
Based on what? 
He just tried to have me and my father killed. 
Bill,I need you to set up a perimeter around his house. 
I'll send a field team right away. 
Have them do an immediate recon, confirm that he's there. 
I want burke standing by with an interrogation kit. 
Jack. 
What? 
As it stands now,mccarthy is our only lead to fayed. 
We need to find fayed before he arms the nukes. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I make contact with the field team. 
We need to go. 
rita. 
Where do you think you're going? 
I'm hungry. 
There's a candy machine in the lobby. 
Don't worry.We'll be leaving soon. 
You said that an our ago. 
Sit down,rita. 
Yes? 
Good news. 
I found someone to program the trigger codes for your bombs. 
Who? 
I've just you sent his profile, employment record,education, the whole curriculum vitae. 
You should have it on your screen. 
I'm looking at it now. 
He seems qualified. 
Oh,he'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly. 
He'll need to be coerced. 
Okay,when will you have him? 
Within the hour. 
Call me when you do. 
mr.Buchanan, 
you need to listen to this. 
What? 
Nsa intercepted a stream of chatter part of it's an audio recording. 
They've identified one of the voices as belonging to fayed. 
Let's hear it. 
Good news. 
I found someone to program the trigger codes on your bombs. 
Who? 
I've just sent you his profile, employment record,education, the whole curriculum vitae. 
It should be on your screen. 
I'm looking at it now. 
He seems qualified. 
he'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly. 
He'll need to be coerced. 
Okay,when will you have him? 
Within the hour. 
Call me when you do. 
Second voice matches the sample we pulled off mccarthy's voice-mail. 
They lost numair in the explosion, so mccarthy found someone else to arm the nukes. 
Send the file to audio forensics. 
Have them scan for any background artifacts that could give us a location. 
Yes,sir. 
I had morris working on something,too. 
We also found an image file inside the data stream. 
Nsa thinks it might be a photo of the engineer. 
Is this it? 
Yeah,it got all corrupted during the intercept. 
I'm writing a salvage utility. 
I should have a new code in a second. 
Getting an image of the engineer may be our only way of stopping those nukes. 
Give me an estimate. 
Well,that's hard to say. 
Could be ten minutes,it could be an hour. 
******** Who's the agent in charge? 
My name is jack bauer. 
Mr.Bauer,I'm hal turner. 
I'll be on point. 
Are your men in position? 
Yes,sir. 
We've sealed off a one-block radius, and our recon has confirmed your brother's inside his wife and son are in there as well. 
I want you to inform your team to use nonlethal force. 
We need to take my brother alive. 
Understood. 
Let me go in with you. 
No. 
You wait here. 
I need to question graem alone. 
What are you gonna do to him? 
Whatever it takes to find out what he knows. 
I'm not stupid,graem I know something is wrong. 
Everything's fine,marilyn. 
You're a lousy liar. 
You always have been. 
You know,if you insist on being here, why don't you make some coffee? 
Why don't you make your own coffee! 
Will you two stop fighting? 
That's all you guys ever do is fight. 
I'm sorry,honey. 
We're just all a little tense today. 
What's going on? 
Nothing. 
Nothing.Why don't, 
why don't we leave your father alone. 
He needs to work. 
put the weapon down! 
Drop the gun! 
What the hell is this,jack?! 
Put it down! 
Do it. 
Get on the floor! 
Take it easy,jack! 
I want you take him into the next room, have burke prep him for questioning. 
I want every hard drive, every memory stick in this house uploaded and sent over to ctu. 
Pick him up. 
Go.Go. 
What are you doing to my dad? 
Josh,I'll explain as soon as I can, but right now I need to speak to your mother. 
Please,just take a seat. 
Please,son,come on. 
Let's go. 
Let go of me! 
stop looking at me like this has something to do with us, because it doesn'T. 
Graem just tried to have me and our father killed. 
Why? 
Why would he try and kill you? 
They nuclear bomb that was detonated earlier today the terrorists acquired it from the family's company! 
Gray's been trying to cover it up. 
I'm sorry,marilyn. 
I understand how difficult this must be for you to believe. 
It's not. 
I may not know the details of what he's done, but I know what he's capable of. 
There are four more other bombs out there. 
We need to get them back is there anything that you can tell me? 
Like what? 
Did gray talk about a man named mccarthy? 
No. 
Are you sure? 
He hasn't confided in me in years. 
He probably never did. 
Marilyn,thousands of lives are at stake. 
Please,just think. 
I wish I knew something,I really wish I did, but I don't know anything. 
And josh doesn't know anything,either, and he doesn't need to know. 
I'll do everything I can to protect him. 
No! 
I've seen what happens when you try and protect people. 
I just want to get my son, and I want to get out of here! 
Marilyn... 
sir,we found two computers, both linked to one network. 
He was trying to erase files we're sending what's left over to ctu. 
Okay,good. 
My sister-in-law and my nephew don't need to stay here. 
Have them transported back to ctu. 
They can be debriefed there. 
Yes,sir. 
Mrs.Bauer. 
We're taking you and your son back to ctu. 
Josh? 
Grandpa. 
You okay? 
Not really. 
Wait in the car,baby. 
Jack told me what graem did, what he was involved with. 
Is it true? 
It's complicated. 
But it's true. 
You make sure he keeps josh out of this. 
I panicked,jack. 
That's all there is to it. 
You panicked? 
That's your excuse? 
You panicked?! 
You tried to kill me and our father. 
I was backed into a corner. 
I was just protecting my ass. 
You knew about a tactical nuclear weapon on american soil. 
You are responsible for the death of thousands and thousands of people. 
You think I really wanted that bomb to go off,jack? 
I think you knew more about mccarthy than you told me. 
How do i find him? 
I don't have a clue. 
How do i find him?! 
I just told you I don't know. 
There are four more bombs out there. 
This isn't a joke,gray. 
Tell me now,how do I find mccarthy? 
I told you everything I know,jack. 
respiration and temperature patterns indicate deception,especially his last reply. 
Set up the interrogation package. 
You don't want to make me do this,gray. 
We grew up together,jack. 
In all those years,I could never make you do anything you didn't want to do. 
I need to talk to you. 
What is it? 
Over here. 
It's morris's brother. 
Timothy? 
He's on his way to horizon regional hospital. 
On-site paramedics confirmed he has severe radiation exposure. 
It says he's in critical condition. 
I'll tell him. 
Wait,chloe. 
I think we should hold off. 
Why? 
Morris is the best hope we have for restoring that file. 
If we drop this on him now, he might completely shut down. 
It's his brother-- we can't keep it a secret. 
I understand. 
This might sound insensitive,but for a second, put aside your personal feelings for morris and consider what's at stake. 
We need him to finish writing that salvage utility. 
I know morris; he can handle it. 
I hope so. 
Morris? 
Yes,darling? 
I have some bad news. 
It's about timothy he's been taken to the hospital. 
I'm sorry. 
Well,this can't be right it says he was pulled... 
from his car by rescue workers just north of valencia. 
Operator. 
Yes,could you connect me with horizon regional hospital,please? 
******* What was he doing in valencia? 
I'm sorry,sir,all circuits are busy. 
Yes,I realize that the lines are busy this is ctu,los angeles,calling I need an emergency breakthrough. 
 I cannot help you at this time,sir. 
 I know... 
Sorry. 
I-I have to go out there. 
Morris,hey, I know it's hard,okay? 
But we are in the middle of a crisis. 
We need to find the engineer before fayed does. 
You can't just leave. 
You can't expect me to sit there when my little brother is dying in the hospital. 
I'm sorry,milo. 
Morris... 
listen. 
12,000 people are dead. 
If fayed finds an engineer, it'll be many,many more. 
Four bombs is about a million people. 
Think about this. 
You can finish writing the program you can do it. 
Yes,I can-- but you started already. 
It will take me half an hour to figure out what you've done. 
You need to stay here and do your job. 
Please. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
Buchanan. 
Bill,it's jack. 
Did chloe pull anything off the hard drives? 
No,she came up empty. 
But 15 minutes ago,the nsa picked up a conversation between mccarthy and fayed. 
*******Mccarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes. 
He's delivering the engineer within the hour. 
The nukes could be operational within 45 minutes? 
That's right. 
I'll get back to you. 
Ctu just confirmed that mccarthy is looking for an engineer for fayed. 
They're gonna arm the nukes. 
Then you're wasting time talking to me,jack. 
You're holding something back. 
That machine doesn't lie. 
Then it must be broken because I've told you everything I know. 
That's hyocine-pentothal. 
It's a neuro-inflamatory,designed to induce pain. 
All you have to do to stop me from using it is tell me how to find mccarthy. 
Your guess is as good as mine. 
Two cc'S. 
come on,come on. 
I can take this to seven cc'S. 
You will experience pain I can't even describe. 
At eight cc's,I run the risk of inducing a heart attack. 
Gray... 
make no mistake about it, I will go there if I have to. 
Please,just tell me what I need to know. 
Please. 
I don't want to hurt you. 
You sure about that,jack? 
Please,gray,just tell me what I need to know. 
How do I find mccarthy?! 
Do it. 
Two cc'S. 
breathe. 
Just breathe. 
Just breathe. 
Please... 
just tell me what I need to know. 
How do I find mccarthy?! 
Damn you. 
Four cc'S. 
That's eight cc's total,jack. 
His vitals are spiking across the line. 
Four cc's! 
Jack,don'T. 
The machine knows you're lying! 
I know you're lying! 
Tell me the truth! 
it has nothing to do with mccarthy. 
it has to do with palmer. 
David palmer? 
Yes. 
I gave the order for his assassination. 
And agent tony almeida... 
and agent michelle dessler your coworkers they're all dead because of me. 
I arranged everything. 
I set the timetable, I paid off the killers, I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall. 
Today wasn't the first time I tried to have you killed,jack. 
Why? 
Because I love my country! 
And in the real world, sometimes that means you have to do things,terrible things... 
even unforgivable things, for the sake of your country. 
But you know all about that,don't you,brother? 
We're the same. 
I mean,look at me. 
We're the same! 
We are not the same! 
You want me to kill you?! 
Do it! 
I'm gonna do it my way! 
Four more cc'S. 
I can't do that. 
Pick up the syringe! 
Do it! 
Now! 
Son of a bitch! 
******** Get me somebody in here now. 
You want to die? 
Drop your weapon! 
Drop it! 
You're gonna die. 
Shut down the iv. 
Shut it down. 
I'm here,baby. 
I'm ashamed. 
What do you mean you're ashamed? 
For spying on those men. 
I thought I was doing the right thing. 
I was wrong. 
You did the only thing that you could do... 
okay,and that was the right thing. 
you're the bravest,most principled man I've ever known. 
you get some rest,okay? 
hello? 
Sandra? 
It's wayne. 
I just heard what happened to walid. 
I am so sorry. 
Is he going to be all right? 
Yeah,I think so. 
What they told me is confusing. 
They said walid was working undercover to expose some plot. 
There was no plot. 
The men weren't part of any conspiracy. 
They were just bystanders. 
They tell me these men had information about the nuclear weapons. 
One of the men pulled it from the internet and showed it to his friends. 
Sandra,they should've reported that. 
They were afraid they were going to get into more trouble than they're already in. 
Most of these men were pulled from their jobs and their homes on trumped-up immigration charges. 
And now they're facing deportation. 
Wayne,you are detaining without due process the people whose help you need the most. 
How do you expect for them to help if they don't have any legal protection? 
Wayne... 
I'm scared. 
I know. 
Everything's gonna be all right. 
What's the status? 
Program's finished. 
I just ran it,but this is all we got. 
I still don't have a clear image. 
what are you doing? 
I'm downloading an unlicensed application from a hacker's site. 
It might kick-start things. 
Or it could corrupt the file. 
I know these guys. 
They write really good code when they're not serving time. 
Unbelievable. 
That's what graem was holding back? 
Not only was he responsible for david palmer's assassination, but he directed the entire conspiracy. 
He was trying to protect the company. 
That's what he's trying to do now. 
Incredible. 
I wish it got us closer to the nukes,but it doesn'T. 
He doesn't know where mccarthy is. 
Were you able to pick up anything on nsa chatter? 
We think it may contain an image of mccarthy's engineer. 
How long till you know for sure? 
Can't say.The file's badly corrupted. 
Morris is working on it now. 
As soon as my brother's ready for transport, I want him sent back to ctu for further debriefing. 
I've redirected a chopper to jackson middle school, four miles west of your position. 
Thanks,bill. 
Dad,graem made his own choices after you let him start running the company. 
You can't make yourself responsible for that. 
That's not fair. 
I'll tell you what isn't fair. 
You deserved a better family,jack. 
Not this. 
Not us. 
I can just imagine what you must be feeling. 
All that time we lost... 
what I wouldn't give to have some of it back. 
Me,too. 
Agent bauer. 
Yeah. 
Your brother's been stabilized. 
He'll be ready to move in ten minutes. 
Thank you. 
Dad,i want you to go back to ctu. 
Okay. 
I need a few minutes. 
Of coursE. 
They're sending a chopper for me. 
I have to go. 
there. 
What? 
The plug-in's working. 
How long's it going to take? 
It's restoring. 
You'll have a photo of the engineer in two minutes. 
Just don't touch anything. 
Now I have got to go and find out what's happening with my brother. 
Save it,milo. 
Thanks for trying to help. 
I'm leaving. 
Watch my station,okay? 
Be careful. 
Call me when you find anything out about timothy. 
I will. 
Congratulations,tom. 
It's an excellent plan. 
Well,thank you very much,mr.Vice president. 
It's about time someone in this administration stood up to these people. 
To be honest, I didn't think this president had the stomach for the cure. 
I think we're about ready for kickoff here,sir. 
I'm going to put you on speakerphone. 
Is the vice president with us? 
I'm on the plane,sir. 
I'm assuming everyone here has read executive order 1066? 
Tom first proposed his plan to me very early this morning,and I rejected it. 
Sacrificing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution seemed like, like too steep a price, even for the promise of securitY. 
But then fayed murdered 12,000 innocent americans with a nuclear weapon. 
I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position. 
After careful reconsideration, I remain convinced that my initial response was in fact the right one. 
That implementing this plan would be a terrible mistake. 
I cannot and I will not endorse these actions. 
Some of you actually seem to feel that the constitution is somehow valid only during times of peace, but not during wartime. 
That is not what the founders intended. 
With your indulgence,sir, george washington's enemies wore bright red coats and marched in a straight line. 
The founders could have never conceived of a stateless enemy, hiding among us,that targets not our soldiers, but our civilization. 
Your plan would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop fayed. 
How does my plan hinder law enforcement,sir? 
By marginalizing and thereby radicalizing the very people whose help they need to enlist. 
The american muslim community is our best line of defense against these terrorists. 
But we americans need to demonstrate that we are governed by the rule of law and never, never by the politics of fear. 
Mr.President. 
Yes,noah? 
Before you make any unilateral decisions, maybe you should hear some other people's thoughts. 
I'm sorry,noah. 
The discussion on this matter... 
is over. 
This better work. 
Jack's on his way back to ctu. 
I want holding "a" and "b" prepped for interrogation and put together a clearance package for him,no restrictions. 
Yes,sir. 
We have it yet? 
It's gonna be a few more seconds. 
As soon as we I.D.The engineer, 
I want it posted on the interagency subnet. 
We need all eyes possible on this. 
Yes,sir. 
Oh,my god! 
It's morris! 
It's his cv,personal history,everything. 
Where is he? 
On his way to horizon regional hospital. 
We got to call that. 
His brother was hurt in the blast. 
He just left. 
Security. 
This is bill bhanan. 
Has morris o'brian left the parking lot? 
He just drove out,sir. 
Damn it! 
Milo,contact lapd. 
Put an apb out on his car. 
Chloe,see if you can raise him on his cell phone. 
Bauer. 
Jack,we just id'ed the engineer. 
It's morris o'brian. 
Morris? 
Yes. 
The file we intercepted was morris's photo and cv. 
Mccarthy was sending it to fayed. 
There is no doubt morris is the engineer. 
Fine.Put him under a protective watch. 
We can'T. 
He's gone. 
He got a call claiming his brother was in the hospital. 
He just left. 
We're trying to raise him on his cell. 
Morris,hold on. 
He's on line one. 
We got him,jack. 
Patch me through. 
Morris,it's bill buchanan. 
We're on the line with jack bauer. 
Where are you? 
I'm on my way to the hospital. 
You need to come back to ctu immediately. 
I can't do that. 
Morris,this is jack. 
Listen to me. 
There is nothing wrong with your brother. 
It's a setup. 
The engineer mccarthy's looking for,it's you. 
Me? 
It was your photo mccarthy was sending to fayed. 
Morris,you need to turn the car around now. 
Okay,okay. 
Morris! 
Get out of the car or the next one's in your head! 
What the bloody hell do you want? 
Don't talk,move! 
Come on.Let's go. 
Jack,they got him! 
It sounds like they're transferring him to another vehicle. 
Chloe,bring up a satellite feed five-mile radius of ctu. 
Hurry. 
Drive. 
yes? 
We're on our way. 
How soon can you be here? 
15 minutes. 
We'll be waiting. 
With my money. 
You'll get paid as soon as I have what I want. 
Let me be clear. 
I'm just delivering him. 
You'll have to make him cooperate. 
He'll cooperate. 
Agent burke, I'd like to speak to my son. 
All right. 
Five minutes. 
Thanks. 
How am I doing? 
You're doing great. 
Everyone thinks jack is so tough. 
Maybe he is... 
but so am I. 
It's nice to know that I can take anything he can dish out. 
You told him about palmer. 
I had to give him something to make him think I cracked, but I kept you out of it. 
It's gonna get a lot worse. 
He's not finished. 
He knows you didn't tell him everything. 
And I won'T.You know I won't,dad. 
They're going to take you to ctu. 
They'll do things there that'll make this seem like a cakewalk. 
Well,like i said, I can take it. 
I'd like to believe that. 
The problem is,I have to be sure. 
Well,you can be. 
I'll hold my mud,dad. 
Everything's going exactly according to plan. 
Jack bought the ruse. 
Oh,I know. 
I'm sure we convinced him that you were going to have me killed as well. 
Yeah, that makes me the bad guy and you the good guy. 
I take the rap,do some time,you skate free. 
Get me out when you can. 
Meanwhile,the company lives on. 
Dad,stick to the plan. 
That's what you've always said,right? 
Make a plan. 
Stick to it. 
Sometimes you have to make adjustments. 
I would never betray you,dad. 
I love you. 
I love you,too,graem. 
You've been a good boy. 
Done everything I asked. 
Only this time,I asked too much. 
Sorry. 
Dad... 
my son's had a seizure! 
Get in here now! 
Hurry up! 
What happened? 
Is he going to make it? 
I don't know. Please,give us the 
room so we can work. 
Get ctu medical now! 
My god, if you people killed my son,I swear... 
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
You didn't just betray me. 
You betrayed your country. 
I swear to you I didn't know. 
But the russians know about the component. 
And they're threatening military action against us if we don't get it back from the chinese. 
You're going to go back to your boyfriend and you're going to make him believe that we have the component back. 
When you go back to mr. Bishop you will find a way 
to excuse yourself from the room. 
To allow him time to access your pda. 
If you can feed all this convincingly to bishop, he will relay it to his russian contact, president suvarov will call off his threat of military action. 
I'm always worried the next crisis is around the corner. 
I think I know how to take your mind off of it. 
Head east, 153 meters. 
That will put you directly beneath ctu. 
This is nadia yassir, code red. 
It is confirmed,look this place down. 
Everyone on the floor! 
you all right? 
Yes, jack.What's going on? 
What do they want with josh? 
What do you mean josh? 
They came here to get him. 
I'm not leaving you. 
Josh, you're not leaving anyo behind, we're gonna be following you. 
Just go through here.Go. Keep going. 
Put your weapon down on the ground. Now! 
I'm putting the weapon down. 
The boy's escaped. 
Get the boy back. 
I don't care what you have to do. 
Josh, I'm going to give you ten seconds. 
If you don't show yourself by the time I finish counting,she dies. 
The operation was successful,my men have your grandson. 
Call me when i can talk to the boy. 
Have you finished repairing the subcircut board? 
Almost. 
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson. 
Who's in command? 
I am.Milo pressman. 
I'm acting director of ctu. 
The following takes place between 3:00 am and 4:00 am. 
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now. 
Get him into the tunnel, now. 
Josh!Josh!Josh. No!Josh. 
Stop it.What are you gonna do,what do you... 
no! 
Marilyn.Marilyn! 
What do you want with him? 
Please, let me...they're taking my child. 
Please! 
Leave her alone! 
he's just a boy. He'S...he's just a boy... 
shut up! 
Wait!Please! 
I can help you calm her down. 
Please, let me just help you. 
Get on your feet! 
Keep her quiet! 
Thank you.Thank you. 
Marilyn.Marilyn 
All of you,listen to me.Pay attention. 
We're moving you to a secure room then we will leave. 
Do what I tell you to do and no one will be hurt. 
Come on. 
we're moving you in two groups. 
Group one, on your feeT. 
What are they doing? 
They got what they want. 
Now they want to stop us from being able to follow them. 
We're going to try to get josh back. 
marilyn, I need you to be at the front of our group.Do you understand me? 
You need to be in the front of our group. 
Group two, on your feet! 
ok,stand up. 
Marilyn, go. 
Nadia.If cheng's men  lock us in the holding room, 
we're gonna lose our only chance to get that component back. 
So we have to do something now. 
Yeah. 
But you need to understand,it's a long shot at best... 
there's a good chance we won't make it through this. 
I understand. 
Stay close to me. 
As soon as I make my move take the first man on the left. 
Okay. 
What are you guys talking about? 
Chloe, keep going. 
Morris, stay alert. 
are you all right? 
Yeah. 
Teams b and c,do we have the hostages secured? 
Yes, sir. All secure. 
they were cheng's men that attacked us. 
They were after my nephew. 
I don't know why,but it has to do something with the component, otherwise why would they take the risk? 
All I need is a tactical set up and comm and I'm ready to go. 
You're still under arrest, jack. 
Nadia, please. 
I know the schematics of this building better than anyone,I can find them. 
Okay, I'll release you,jack, but doyle's in command. 
Fine. 
Give him whatever he needs. 
yes How many casualties did you sustain? 
One. 
Milo pressman. 
Are you okay? 
No. 
I'm set,we need to go. 
Use my cell until comm's up. 
You did great. 
**move,let's go. 
That was really brave. 
I need to restore comm and satellite immediately. 
There may be more server capacity in data storage. 
Try it. 
keep*** climb up.Let's go. 
Hello, josh. 
Who are you? 
Start loading,we're moving out. 
What do you want from me? 
What took so long? 
I've been waiting for your call. 
I have the boy with me. 
Put him on the phone. 
Your grandfather wants to speak with you. 
My grandfather? 
Yes. 
Take the phone. 
Grandpa? 
Hello, joshua. 
Look...I'm sorry, i know you've been through a lot. 
I'm sorry? 
A few hours ago you pointed a gun at my head and said you'd kill me. 
I never would have hurt you. 
I heard you say it! 
I had to make it sound convincing... 
to you and to jack. 
Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten away. 
But I wouldn't hurt you.Not for anything. 
This way. 
What do you want from me? 
To protect you. 
From what? 
From your father's mistakes. 
If you stay here... 
they'll never let you forget what your father did. 
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country. 
Some place we can both start over. 
Where? 
China. 
Within a decade,they will have surpassed this country in every possible way. 
And we can be part of it, josh. 
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born. 
I don't know what the hell you're talking about. 
No, I didn't think you would. 
But you will. 
I'll explain everything when I see you. 
Right now, all i need is for you to keep an open mind. 
Let's go. 
No, wait, please!I don't want to be with my grandpa. 
I'm afraid of him. 
Your grandfather's a visionary you should be grateful for the opportunity. 
I don't want to be with him, though! 
go, go, go, go,go, go, go, go, go! 
Cheng's using the boy as a shield hold your fire!Hold your fire! 
I've got two hostiles at the suv! 
Cover me now! 
Go,go,go,go!move! 
This is bauer.I've got one hostile down. 
We're moving towards the roof. 
Go!Go!Go! 
����*** Cheng,it's over! 
Put your weapon down!Now! 
Put it down! 
Where is the boy?! 
Tell me where the boy is,and I won't kill you. 
 Help! 
 Josh! 
 Help! 
 Josh... 
 Help Hold on Josh...here,you need to grab my arm. 
Do it now.Now!Now! 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
Mike,it's jack.I'm on the roof. 
I lost cheng,but I've got josh. 
I need to secure him. 
On our way up now. 
We're setting up a perimeter around the building. 
Josh,the man who had you,his name was cheng. 
Did he explain why he tried to take you? 
No,but he made me talk on the phone with grandpa. 
He did? 
 You talked to your grandfather? 
 Yeah. 
What'd he say? 
He said that he loved me,that he wanted to take me to china and that I was his legacy. 
I think he's out of his mind. 
Josh,listen to me,I need your help. 
Was there anything that you might have heard that could help us figure out where your grandfather is? 
 No. 
 Josh,think. 
I don't know.I'm sorry.I'm sorry... 
josh,no.Hey,hey,it's all right. 
It's all right. 
Come on,let's get you back to your mom. 
Jack! 
Ctu has a team on the way to secure the area. 
You need to let them know my father's still involved in this. 
Your father's involved with the chinese?Why? 
I don't know.I'll ask him when I find him. 
 Sir? 
 Come in,karen. 
I just got off the phone with the pentagon, and the latest intel indicates that the russians are moving another two mechanized divisions into the central asian theater. 
 Are they within striki distance of our base? 
 Yes. 
And the troops are at the highest level of alert. 
Sir,tom lennox was supposed to be on the call with me, and I couldn't find him or get him on the telephone. 
Is there something that I should know about? 
Tom is out in the field running a classified operation. 
He figured out who the leak was. 
 Who? 
 Lisa miller  Lisa miller is spying for the russians? 
 No. 
The man lisa is romantically involved with is. 
For the last year,this man,mark bishop's been passing lisa's e-mails along to the russians, along with other things that... 
she told him in confidence. 
And that's how the russians knew the chinese had the component. 
 Does lisa know? 
 She does now. 
Tom sent her back to this man, bishop,with a cover story and falsified e-mails that we hope will convince the russians that we've destroyed the circuit board before the chinese could get it out of the country, and with any luck, bishop'll forward those e-mails to the russians and they'll back off. 
And we'll have bought time to actually retrieve the... 
component from the chinese. 
Well,I hope that works,sir. 
Karen.Sit down. 
I know you're wondering why you've been kept out of the loop on this, so let me assure you it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. 
I don'T...I don't understand. 
At the same time lisa was... 
with bishop,she and I were... 
in a relationship as well. 
Needless to say... 
I am ashamed. 
Well...sir,I... 
I think you're being a little hard on yourself. 
You and lisa were both single,and... 
there's no way you could know what she was doing behind your back. 
It's a question of judgment. 
I trusted her. 
And unless tom's plan succeeds... 
that mistake will bring us to war. 
and finally we're done.Here we go. 
You okay? 
I'm great.That was great. 
It felt like you were somewhere else. 
I'm just tired. 
It's been a long day. 
I'll be right back. 
Do you think he's just concerned or...suspicious? 
Yeah,I don't know. 
But she is leaving him alone with the pda. 
This could be it. 
He's making his move,he's making his move. 
Is that excellent? 
That must be the device he's using to forward the e-mails to the russians. 
GentlemeN...he is taking the bait. 
Come on.Come on.There you go. 
Come on,come on,come on. 
Send these e-mails.Come on. 
He's not going to,sir. 
He's putting her pda away. 
Sweetheart,I'm just gonna pour myself a glass of wine. 
 You want something? 
 Sure.I'll have what you're having. 
You know,I don't think it's just that you're tired. 
What are you talking about? 
I can tell from the way you were in bed that something's wrong. 
All right,we have a problem here. 
I told you everything's fine. 
Then why can't you look me in the eye? 
Because you're making me nervous staring at me like that? 
Can we stop talking about this? 
 Mark... 
 I know you. 
 You don't get nervous. 
 Stop it.You're hurting me. 
 What's going on?! 
 Nothing's going on! 
 You're lying! 
 I'm not lying! 
Tell me what's going on! 
All right,this is not good. 
All right,I'll tell you what's going on. 
 What's going on you're a lying son of a bitch! 
 We got to get in there quick!Come on! 
I put myself on the line for you and all you were doing was whoring yourself to the russians, stealing my e-mail,you bastard! 
Bitch! 
They're gonna charge me with treason! 
I'll be put in jail! 
who knows about me and the russians?!Who knows?! 
Freeze!Get him off her! 
Put Mr. Bishop in the bedroom. 
She's got a pulse.It's faint. 
She's breathing. 
All right,let's get an ambulance here fast. 
Mr. Bishop,I'm tom lennox. 
I would guess you've already familiarized yourself with the white house staff. 
If I could have a moment alone with the prisoner? 
Mr. Bishop,we have incontrovertible evidence 
you were spying for the russians. 
We have recordings of you on the phone with the agent running you, and now,of course,we've got this. 
Do I have your attention? 
All right.So here it is. 
You are going to upload the e-mails on Ms. Miller's pda 
to your russian employers. 
Additionally,you are going to call your handler and back up the story these e-mails tell namely,that our country destroyed the circuit board before it could fall into chinese hands. 
Now,if you comply, we'll push for leniency in your sentencing. 
If you do not,I can all but guarantee you the death penalty. 
 what is it,cheng? 
 I lost the boy. 
 Who has him? 
 Ctu and your son. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
The boy was my price for repairing the circuit board. 
I lost many men trying to give you your price,Mr. Bauer! 
I really don't give a damn about your operational incapacities. 
 Our arrangement is over. 
 It cannot be over. 
You have our component. 
You failed to hold up your end of the deal. 
The circuit board is no longer yours. 
You repair the circuit board and return it to us or there'll be serious consequences! 
Now you listen to me. 
I'm not afraid of you,cheng. 
And the next time you threaten me, the consequences will be serious but not for me. 
�� Any luck? 
Chloe,have our teams been able to locate cheng or the sub-circuit board? 
No,nothing yet. 
What's the status on our satellite? 
We managed to reroute circuits through an undamaged subsystem. 
We should have the gd back up in ten minutes. 
Try to make it five. 
Nadia yassir? 
Yeah,can I help you? 
My name is ben kram,I'm from division. 
You should have received a flash memo alerting you of my arrival. 
Well,our systems are still down so we can't receive memos just yet. 
That's exactly why I'm here. 
I've been authorized to compile an accounting and assessment of your security breach. 
Well,sir,we're right in the middle of a recovery operation and it's 3:00 in the morning. 
I mean,this isn't the best time to be questioning my people. 
Frankly,Ms. Yassir,I don't particularly care what you think. 
Excuse me? 
This incident represents a serious breach in your security protocols, one which resulted in a loss of ctu personnel. 
Obviously,mistakes were made; errors in judgment. 
Not the least of which was my accepting bill buchanan's recommendation to leave someone with your limited experience in charge. 
So,can I,uh,count on your full cooperation or not? 
I never said otherwise. 
Super. 
I'll need a full staff roster and access to all departments plus some kind of a station to set up my investigation. 
You can work out of that conference room over there. 
Thank you. 
Yeah,this is nadia yassir. 
There is a group from division here in conference room "B.�� 
Please give them whatever it is that they need. 
Nadia. 
Yeah,morris? 
This may not be my place, don't let those buggers from division get to you. 
You're not responsible for what happened. 
Of course I'm responsible. 
It happened on my watch. 
There's nothing you could have done. 
Do not let them hang you out to dry. 
No,morris,people are dead. 
Milo is dead because of me. 
That's ridiculous. 
There's nothing anyone could have done,darling. 
No,I...I could have stood up. 
I could have said something. 
There was no time. 
Milo jumped in. 
There was time. 
I just hesitated. 
I was just... 
you were just afraid? 
Yeah,I have a bit of experience with that. 
Look,I'm not one to give advice on how to handle self-recrimination, but I know this: Milo was a brave man. 
He never would have sacrificed himself if he knew you could allow others to lay his death at your feet. 
He'd want you to stay strong,stay in charge. 
Sir,tom lennox is on the line for you. 
Thanks. 
Tom,I'm here with karen. 
Yes,sir,that information we planted for the russians, that has been sent on to bishop's contact. 
Good. 
Do you think it's made its way to suvarov yet? 
I'm confident it has,sir. 
But I do think a call to the russian president giving him the news ourselves, that might well strengthen the credibility of our story here. 
I agree. 
Tom,thanks. 
Uh,sir,there is one other thing. 
What's that? 
We had some complications,and,uh, lisa was injured in the operation. 
How badly? 
Well,she experienced a loss of oxygen to the brain. 
Won't know the extent of the damage till she regains consciousness. 
She is on her way to the hospital. 
How the hell did this happen? 
Sir,she attacked bishop suddenly before we could even get in there. 
He almost strangled her to death. 
And what were you doing during all this? 
You were supposed to be watching her the whole time! 
Where was secret service? 
Sir,we did everything we could. 
It just happened too fast. 
All right,thank you,tom. 
All right,I'll be back there shortly. 
I'm so sorry,sir. 
I know that despite her betrayal, you still have feelings for lisa. 
Unfortunately,we do have a pressing matter to address. 
suvarov. 
Yes,sir,we've got to call him immediately and tell him that the chinese no longer have the component and that it has been destroyed. 
Set it up in the telepresence suite. 
Right away,sir. 
I'm gonna get you back to your mom soon,okay? 
Just sit here. 
I'll be right back. 
 ctu  This is jack. 
 Patch me through to marilyn bauer's cell phone. 
 Yes,sir. 
Jack,ground teams have done a thorough search of the area and cheng's vehicles. 
The sub circuit board's not here. 
What about aerial surveillance? 
The choppers have picked up nothing and we just now got satellite back online. 
It looks like cheng got out. 
There's nothing more we can do here. 
 Get your men ready. We'll go back to ctu. 
 got it  Hello? 
 Hey,it's me. 
Did they tell you josh was safe? 
Yeah,but that's all they'll tell me. 
What's going on? 
When can I see him? 
We should be back at ctu in the next few minutes. 
Marilyn,the chinese were doing this for my father. 
They were trying to get josh to him. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah,josh spoke to him. 
What did he tell josh? 
He said he wanted to take him back to china, that josh was his legacy. 
That's it? That's all he said? 
Yeah. 
Can I talk to him? 
Of course. Hold on one second. 
Hey,it's your mom. 
 Mom. 
 Hey! 
Hey,are you okay? 
Did they hurt you? 
No,I'm all right. 
I don't know what i would do if I lost you. 
Mom,uncle jack,he saved my life. 
I know. 
I love you so much. 
I love you,too,mom. 
I'll see you soon,all right? 
Okay,honey. 
You okay? 
Come on. We need to go. 
Sir,president suvarov is standing by for you. 
Whenever you're ready. 
Let's do this. 
President suvarov, you have a secure conference with vice president daniels. 
Mr. President,I have some good news to share with you. 
And what is this good news,Mr. Vice president? 
We were successful in locating and taking out the chinese agents who were attempting to smuggle the fb sub-circuit board out of the country. 
Are you saying you have the component back in your possession? 
No,sir. 
The sub-circuit board was destroyed when we attacked the chinese. 
I see. 
I assume you have proof of this? 
Yes,we do. 
In addition to fragments from the destroyed component, I'm prepared to give you whatever images or documentation you need to assure that this threat's been neutralized. 
Do you mean the same documentation you planted with one of my agents? 
Excuse me? 
The same images you coerced him into sending to my people of a strike that accomplished nothing but destroying an empty building? 
Yes,I know you exposed one of my operatives. 
I had him under surveillance, which is how I know about your raid on his apartment. 
Mr. President... 
now,if the chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire russian defense system will be compromised. 
I told you I would hold you and your government responsible. 
I will not tolerate any threats from you,Mr. President. 
We're doing everything in our power to ensure this component does not reach china. 
I have already given you ample time to recover it. 
Now I am feeling less generous. 
If you do not deliver complete and irrefutable proof to our embassy that you have recovered or destroyed this component within two hours, I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter to compensate for our defensive vulnerabilities. 
You are talking about attacking one of our military bases. 
Now I would urge you to consider the consequences of that. 
We have just as many troops in that area and allies who will not look kindly upon any unprovoked aggression on my country. 
You and I both know it will not be unprovoked. 
This is a matter of survival for us. 
It is in both our interests that you get that component back. 
You have two hours. 
It was all for nothing. 
Excuse me,sir? 
This ruse,it bought us nothing. 
We're about to go to war over a piece of circuitry. 
this is the agenda for the vice president's briefing with the military. 
Okay. When did they start? 
A few minutes ago. 
they're in the oval office. 
All right,I'll play catch up. 
Tom lennox. 
Who? 
All right,put him through. 
The russians are blaming us for allowing the chinese theft of the fb sub-circuit board and they're preparing to retaliate against us. 
All our efforts to reacquire the component have failed, so we have no choice but to defend ourselves. 
And to make provisions for the escalation of this conflict beyond the central asian theater. 
excuse me,Mr. Vice president. 
I'm glad you could make it,tom. 
General kram is about to run some response scenarios. 
Before we do that,sir,I need a moment alone with you and karen. 
Excuse us,ladies and gentlemen. 
I've got phillip bauer calling for you on a scrambled line. 
What? What does he want? 
I don't know. 
But he's in league with the chinese. 
I think we need to hear him out. 
Put him on speaker. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Thank you for taking my call,Mr. Vice president. 
What's this about? 
I think you know what this is about. 
Tell me anyway so there's no miscommunication. 
I want my grandson. 
And I want clear passage to the country of my choice. 
You give me that,and I'll give you the fb sub-circuit board. 
You're working with the chinese? 
I was. 
They had their chance,they blew it. 
How do I know you even have this component? 
Serial number 3ptl3. 
Check it against any records you have. 
And there it is,sir. 
You realize what you're asking? 
I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding a conflict this country does not want, a war this country cannot afford. 
Not after what's happened today. 
I'll send my instructions on an encrypted data stream. 
Mr. Bauer... 
sir,you're not seriously considering this? 
Phillip bauer is a federal fugitive... 
complicit in selling nuclear weapons to terrorists. 
I know what crimes he's committed. 
Then how can you even entertain the thought of negotiating with him? 
Because it may be we can't afford not to. 
We are talking about trading the life of an innocent young boy. 
We're talking about the lives of a lot more young men if we go to war with russia. 
And you think phillip bauer is somebody that we can trust? 
The man is a sociopath. 
Tom? 
He is a sociopatH. 
She's right about that. 
But given the stakes,this is a risk worth taking,sir. 
None of this makes sense. 
Everything we know about suvarov tells us the man wouldn't risk military engagement, even for this piece of technology. 
Unless he's being squeezed. 
Who by? 
His cabinet? 
No. The military. 
Gredenko was not the only anti-american general left over from the soviet regime. 
Yes,some of them are still in power, and suvarov does rely on them. 
So you think these generals are just looking for an excuse to pull the trigger. 
Well,certainly sounds plausible,sir. 
Well,if that is the case,then we have no choice. 
We have to recover that stolen circuit board. 
Get me ctu. 
As soon as we get back to ctu, you and your mother will be transported to a safe location. 
How long will we be there? 
Until we find your grandfather. 
Uncle jack,when you find him,what are you going to do to him? 
Josh,I don't want you worrying about this. 
But I promise you, he will never threaten you or your mother again. 
Agent bauer! 
Call for you. It's urgent. 
Josh,get in the car I'll be right there. 
Josh,you need to come with me. 
What do you mean? 
Come now! 
Uncle jack! 
Agent doyle! 
Uncle jack! 
Agent doyle! 
Orders jack! 
Go back to ctu! 
The boy stays with me! 
Get out of my way. 
take him dowN. 
What are you doing?! 
Uncle jack! 
Take him to ctu! 
Uncle jack! 
Josh! 
I would like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere. 
The majority of your cabinet feels that you're making a tragic mistake. 
The man has murdered countless innocents, and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him. 
They will come after you. 
I assure you of that. 
We're talking about removing the President of the United States. 
We are in the middle of a national crisis, and he is in over his head. 
He has brought this on himself. 
I need the president's itinerary, specifically in regards to Assad's televised address. 
Why do you need this? 
The less you know, the better. 
Because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he was.s. 
CHLOE: You can't blame yourself. 
When the next bomb goes off, and thousands of more people die, everybody will remember that I was the one that made it possible. 
CTU found me. 
I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape. 
The delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high-priority targets. 
Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three. 
More than enough for our needs,Gredenko. 
Our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans. 
Today we will correct that mistake, and the Arabs will take all the blame. 
Marilyn, it is vital that we find this man Gredenko. 
If we retrace the route that you took that night, do you think that you would recognize the house? 
Maybe. 
What's going on with you and Jack? 
He's looking for someone he thinks I can help. 
You mean Gredenko? 
What do you know about him? 
I followed Graem to a house one night, he met with some Russians. 
Jack wants to take me over there to see if it can jog my memory. 
PHILLIP: Now you're not going to take Jack to the house where Graem met the Russians. 
You're going to take him to a different address. 
Now you do this for me, and I promise you you will see Josh again. 
If you don't, he dies. 
Marilyn, is any of this familiar? 
MARILYN: Yes. That's it. 
The pale blue house on the right. 
JACK: Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
Go! Go! 
Bomb! Everyone out! 
(automatic gunfire) Come on, move, move, move! 
Don't stop! 
(phone rings) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
BUCHANAN: What do you got? 
We've been ambushed. 
The house that Marilyn led us to was wired with explosives. 
Half my team is down I need you to send paramedics to 9407 Hendry Place. 
Bill, they knew we were coming. 
You mean Gredenko? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Right now I'm trying to find Milo and Marilyn. 
I think they're being pursued by hostiles. 
I'll have a team there in ten minutes. 
I'll monitor local bandwidth, see what I can come up with. 
Bill, hurry, we need to find them. 
(breathleMarilyn, come on, we've I-I can't...got to keep moving. 
You understand? 
Come on, move. 
Move! 
Check the warehouse. 
(labored breathing) REPORTER: The fallout has prevented emergency workers from coming within several miles (phone ringing) of ground zero, but survivors are being treated at local hospitals and makeshift medical facilities like the one behind me. 
Local authorities continue to urge people to stay in their home until further notice. 
Yeah? 
HACKER: We took out the CTU team. 
So is my son dead? 
Yes, sir. 
(sighing): Right, well... 
had to be done. 
You have Marilyn? 
No, sir, not yet. 
Why not yet? 
She escaped with someone from CTU, but we're tracking them now. 
Damn it, Hacker. 
We'll find her soon, sir. 
The man she's with doesn't look like a trained field agent. 
Make sure you take her alive. 
I need her to find Gredenko so I can end this mess. 
I understand, sir. 
I'll call you as soon as I have her. 
(clattering) Hey. 
They know we're here. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
Marilyn, listen to me. 
I'm going to cover you. 
When I do, I want you to head back towards the alley. 
I want you to run as fast and as far away from here as you can, you understand me? 
Okay. 
The targets are right behind us. 
Behind those Dumpsters. 
Remember... 
we need to take that woman alive. 
Just wait... 
wait till I tell you. 
Go! 
(screaming) I can't! 
(cries out) I told you to go! 
I couldn't! 
(groaning) Let's go. 
Wait! Wait! 
Kill him. 
(pained grunting) (gunshots, Marilyn screams) Drop your weapon! 
Let her go! 
Drop your weapon or I will kill her. 
If you wanted to kill her, she'd be dead by now. 
Now drop your weapon! 
Or I will use mine! 
Do it! 
On your knees! 
Now! Hands on your head! 
Interlace your fingers! 
Turn around and face the fence! 
Milo! 
Let me see it. 
(pained groaning) The bullet went through and through. 
There's no arterial bleeding. 
You're going to be okay. 
CTU will be here in a minute. 
Take this gun. 
Make sure he doesn't move. 
(whimpering) (screams) That call you took, that was from Gredenko. 
You tipped him off! 
Now over half my team is dead! 
You don't understand. 
What don't I understand? 
That Gredenko knew we were coming? 
It wasn't Gredenko on the phone. 
Those aren't his men. 
If those weren't Gredenko's men, whose were they? 
Who sent them? 
Your father. 
What are you talking about? 
It's true, Jack. 
I swear. 
Your father called me in the car. 
My father? 
He told me to lead you to that house. 
He said if I didn't... 
he said he'd killed Graem, and that if he had to, he would kill Josh. 
I'm sorry. 
He has my son. 
(sobbing) Marilyn. 
Do you have the address to Gredenko's safe house? 
(mouthing) I need you to give it to me now. 
I can't. 
I can't. 
Not until I have my son. 
I will help you get Josh back, but I need that address now. 
Gredenko is our only chance of recovering the nuclear weapons. 
You saw what happened in Valencia earlier today. 
This is going to be worse. 
Please. 
Just give me the address. 
I recognized the house once we were driving. 
It's on Glascoe-- 9421. 
Don't move. 
(phone rings) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
I've got the correct address for Gredenko's safe house. 
9421 Glascoe. 
Turner's team will be there any minute. 
You run point on this. 
No, I want you to send me a smaller team to my location. 
I'm at an industrial park on Pine, just south of Oxford. 
Make sure the team brings me a vehicle with a full tactical kit. 
Then they're gngng to have to transfer Milo back to CTU. 
He's been shot, but he's not critical. 
I want you to divert the rest of the team to the address on Glascoe have them initiate the attack. 
Get back to me as soon as soon you've got Gredenko in custody. 
Jack, what's going on? 
I'll explain everything later. 
That's not good enough. 
Bill, please. 
Just trust me. 
This is personal. 
Jack! 
Hi. 
Hey. 
Did you finish the vectors? 
No. 
You know, if you're having trouble, I can help you. 
I'm not having trouble. 
I'm just not finished, and I don't want this to turn into another conversation about whether or not I'm okay. 
I'm sorry, love. 
It's all right, but if you can't talk to me, then you should talk to a staff psychologist or your sponsor. 
I don't need a shrink. 
I don't want to talk to my sponsor, I'll be fine. 
We just heard from Jack. 
Marilyn Bauer's safe, and she gave us Gredenko's location. 
Milo was shot during the operation, but he's going to be okay. 
What happened? 
He held off three armed hostiles until Jack could get there. 
From what I understand, he's going to be up for a commendation. 
Morris, when Milo gets here, I want you to debrief him as soon as medical gives you the okay. 
Yeah, yeah, I'll debrief him, and thanks for rubbing that salt in the wounds. 
What are you talking about? 
The nukes are armed because I'm a coward, and now you want me to listen to Milo talk about what a bloody hero he is. Agh! 
Coincidence? 
It'll be taken care of, thanks. 
Taken care of. 
We're coordinating the Gredenko operation from here. 
Tac teams are moving in on his location. 
I'll be right there. 
Obviously I pushed you back to work too soon. 
I'll have someone from district relieve you. 
No, no, that would just make me feel worse. 
Look, I need a few minutes I'll be fine. 
I'm going to take a walk. 
I'll cover for you, but you need to be back here before we launch. 
Yeah, I will. 
Give me the phone; we need to make the call. 
Scramble collar has to be enabled. 
(indistinct communication over police radio) (beeping) (distant siren blaring) Give us a second, please. 
Does he know where Phillip is holding Josh? 
No. 
I'm gonna have to force my father's hand. 
Meaning what? 
He's gonna call my father, tell him he's apprehended you, but that you won't give him Gredenko's location until he takes you to see your son. 
What if Phillip refuses? 
Then you have to stay firm. 
Tell him it's not a negotiation, no matter what he threatens. 
Jack, you're asking me to put Josh's life at risk. 
Josh's life is at risk. 
Trust me, my father is not going to give away his location unless he thinks he has to. 
Is that what this is about finding Phillip? 
Josh is secondary? 
My father will have Josh with him. 
Marilyn, I will do everything in my power to make sure your son is safe. 
How do you know he won't betray us? 
He wants to live. 
Let's go. 
You don't want to watch this. 
You know, Josh... 
your father was very proud of you. 
He used to tell me how blessed he felt knowing everything that he was working so hard to build would be left in such good hands. 
Do we really have to talk about this right now, Grandpa? 
No... of course not. 
He loved you very much. 
Remember, I'll be able to hear both sides of this conversation. 
You're set. 
Dial. 
(phone speed-dialing) (phone rings) Do you have her? 
Yeah... but we 
took casualties. 
I'm on my own now. 
Are you assembling another team to take out Gredenko? 
Yeah, I am, but she's refusing to tell me where Gredenko is until she sees her son. 
Put her on. 
I did what you asked, now where's Josh? 
Marilyn, look, I know you're frightened, but this doesn't have to end badly. 
If you help me find Gredenko, we can all survive this, as a family. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
I just want my son. 
I'm just saying, you made your deal with Graem. 
Now make a deal with me. 
With enough time, you and I... and Josh 
can rebuild whatever is left of this family. 
After all, the legacy I'm trying to preserve will someday be his. 
We can do this. 
But first, you have to tell me where Gredenko is. 
Only after this man takes me to see my son. 
Bringing you here will only complicate things, and I need Gredenko now. 
Tell me where he is. 
No. 
You may have misunderstood my offer as a sign of weakness, so let me make it perfectly clear. 
If you do not help me, I see no future for you or Josh. 
I will walk into the next room, and I will kill him. 
Right now. 
Tell me... or Josh dies. 
I will not tell you what you want to know until I have my son. 
Give him back the phone. 
(sobbing) Yeah? 
Bring her to me at the Grandmont Hotel. 
Room 2132. 
We're on our way. 
We got the address. 
You did great. 
Cuff him, put him in the back. 
(sniffles) (handcuffs clicking) Josh? 
Uh, I'm just gonna go downstairs to get a soda. 
Did you want anything? 
No, thanks. 
Did you look in the minibar? 
Uh, yeah, but there really wasn't anything that I wanted. 
Why don't you call room service? 
Well, I just feel like getting out. 
Josh... 
Don't even think about it. 
No one's life is worth the destruction of everything I've built. 
Now step away from the door. 
I was beginning to worry. 
Meeting went long. 
Here's the President's itinerary. 
Oh, good. 
This will work. 
So when... 
when does all this happen? 
Now. 
I need you to authorize clearance for someone to get inside the bunker. 
Once he's inside, he'll carry the ball. 
"Carry the ball"? 
You mean, kill the President. 
Sir, I would like to think that we are beyond the point of second-guessing ourselves. 
This President has endangered the lives of millions of people. 
You do not need to tell me what the stakes are here. 
So who is this person we're putting inside? 
He's a security specialist, private sector, but I've already put in a request for him to advise my group on civil response options. 
He has level two clearance; I just need you upgrade him. 
They will trace this thing right back to me. 
No. You won't even 
be investigated. 
We have a cover. 
A cover? Who? 
Assad. 
Assad? 
You're trying to make it look like he did this? 
Sir, all you need to do is call in your authorization code. 
(phone ringing) That's all the information you need on him. 
Yeah, Dan. 
Mr. Lennox, the President 
has asked to see you. 
Okay, tell the President I will be with him in a moment. 
Sir, our man will be here within the hour. 
Call me when you're done with the President. 
Tom, come in. 
You asked to see me, sir? 
Yes, I'd like to hear your thoughts about something. 
My thoughts on what, sir? 
Assad's speech. 
He's going live in less than one hour, and before I give him my thoughts, I wanted to hear yours. 
Is there a problem? 
Uh, no, sir, it's just... 
What? 
I assumed you were no longer interested in my opinion, sir. 
Tom, I still value your judgment, and if I've made you feel otherwise, I apologize. 
All right, sir. 
How much longer? 
I'm not sure. 
I have to recalculate the profile for two of the target cities. 
Hurry. 
I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary. 
You think the authorities know we're working with Fayed? 
If they don't, they will soon. 
WOMAN (harried): I was in my kitchen when I saw the flash. 
I turned to look out my window, and it just exploded, all the windows. 
There was glass everywhere. 
And then there was this sound. 
It was so loud. 
Oh, man. 
Hell of a day, huh? 
Yeah, you could say that. 
Can I get you anything else? 
No. 
Yeah. 
Whiskey. Plain, single malt. 
What kind? 
That kind. 
This? 
Yeah. 
And these. 
Okay. 
(register drawer opening) Your change? 
Keep it. 
(grunts) (sobbing) (retching) (phone rings) MORRIS: I'm on my way. 
From where? 
I told you, I went out for a walk. 
The Tac Team is about to move in on Gredenko. 
I need you at your station. 
I'm on my way. 
Morris... 
(sobbing) Come with me. 
I want you to put this on, under your clothes. 
It's just a precaution. 
(frustrated grunt) My hands are shaking. 
Here. 
I'm going to do everything I can to get him back. 
He's the only reason I stayed with Graem... 
He was the only good thing I had left since... 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Get out. 
(grunts) You do exactly what I tell you. 
You understand me? 
Hey, Milo? 
Hey. 
How are you holding up? 
(groans)... They say 
I'm going to be okay. 
(sighs) It's... 
So what happened? 
I was stupid. 
They don't pay me to be a field agent. 
Well, maybe they should, because, uh... 
you protected Marilyn Bauer. 
That's what I heard. 
I had no idea what I was doing. 
The whole thing just happened so fast. 
You don't have to downplay it to make me fell better. 
You don't have to do that. 
Okay. 
Uh... 
Hey. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
Well done. 
Thanks. 
I'm going to push Assad to make these changes. 
Your suggestions are all excellent, Tom. 
Oh? Just doing my job, 
Mr. President. 
I'd like you to be there when he delivers this. 
I will be, sir. 
If you'll excuse me, I have a briefing with Senator Benson. 
Of course, Tom. 
(phone beeps) Melinda? 
I have some notes that need to be taken to Assad. 
MELINDA (over intercom): Yes, Mr. President. 
(quietly): What did the president want? 
He asked me to review Assad's speech. 
Which he'll never get the chance to deliver. 
Listen, sir... you need 
to authorize that clearance. 
Our man will be here any minute. 
It's in the works. 
It's just taking a while to complete the authorization. 
All right, well, we need it before he's here. 
I will call security again. 
I will phone you back if there's any problem. 
Meanwhile, go meet with him. 
This is Tom Lennox. 
I need to speak to the ranking Secret Service agent on site. 
MAN (over phone): Agent Hollister. 
Agent Hollister, this is Tom Lennox. 
I need to see you immediately. 
Yes, sir. 
I can meet you as soon as I get someone to man my position, which should be in about 15 minutes. 
No, that's not soon enough. 
I've got something to show you. 
Where are you right now? 
"B" Wing, room 17. 
I'm on my way. 
(groans) Carson wondered if you were playing us. 
He said that he didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you! 
I said that we could trust you. 
I told him that you understood. 
Nothing justifies the killing of a president. 
This president is giving us no choice. 
Don't do this. 
(grunting): It's already done. 
(panting) Yes, uh, this is Reed Pollock. 
I have a message for Agent Hollister from Mr. Lennox. 
Yes. Could you please tell him 
that the issue has been resolved and that Mr. Lennox won't need 
to meet with him. 
MAN (over phone): Yes, sir. 
Okay. Thanks. 
NADIA: We just confirmed Marilyn Bauer's intel. 
The Glasgow house is owned by a Russian shell corporation that Gredenko has a hidden interest in. 
Is Turner's team in place? 
They'll let me know when they're ready to go. 
Chloe, lock satellite and establish a comm link. 
Nadia. 
(quietly): Where were you? I told you 
not to take too long. 
Sorry. 
Comm unit's operational, but the backup module needs to be reset. 
You better go do it now; the operation starts in two minutes. 
(quietly): Come with me. 
Do you realize that after everything we've been through what a betrayal this is? 
I was a little late. 
Morris, I can smell it on your breath. 
Yes... I took a drink, 
but I spat it out straight away. 
Please... 
I swear. 
Chloe, look at me. 
Look at me. 
I am stone-cold sober. 
You're losing control. 
You're placing other people's lives in danger. 
(sighs) I'm going to have to tell Buchanan. 
After everything that has happened... 
(chuckles)... 
something had to give. 
The important thing is, that I realized I didn't want to throw everything away, especially you, especially you. 
And I stopped myself, and that is a little victory. 
Right? 
I swear, it will never happen again. 
Please don't tell Buchanan because you're right me getting back to work is the best medicine. 
I'll be watching you for the rest of the shift. 
Fine. 
Call your sponsor. 
I will. 
Turner's team is taking final positions. 
Chloe, open the video link. 
Hal, what's your status? 
No sign of a lookout. 
Windows are covered, but we're good to go. 
Commence at your discretion. 
Ryan, is your team ready? 
Yes, sir. 
Okay, we're going in on three, two, one. 
Clear! 
Clear! 
Clear! 
Clear! 
First sweep, all clear, sir. 
Roger that. 
TURNER (over link): Mr. Buchanan, there no sign 
of Gredenko or anyone. 
Hal, as soon as you've completed a full sweep, process the place for evidence. 
Yes, sir. 
Chloe, text Jack's cell phone, tell him we don't have Gredenko. 
(panting) (phone vibrating) Hold up here. 
What's wrong? 
It's nothing. 
Don't even think about trying to warn my father. 
Once he sees that you brought me here, he's more likely to shoot you than I am. 
Do you understand me? 
Yeah. 
Both of you go up to the door. 
You knock; when he let's you in, I'll follow. 
Let's go. 
Marilyn, get back. 
Open the door. 
Now, go. 
Where the hell is my father? 
I don't know, I swear. 
Where's Josh? 
Marilyn, just stay calm. 
Put these on. 
(phone rings) Answer it; put it on speaker. 
Hello? 
PHILLIP: Hello, Marilyn. 
Jack, even when you were young, I learned never to underestimate you. 
I didn't want to hurt Josh. 
You've forced my hand. 
Take a look out the window, the adjacent roof. 
(gasps) Oh, Phillip, please don't! 
JACK: Dad... 
you only have one play left here, that's to try and cut a deal with the government. 
Explain your connection to the nuke; tell them you'll try and help them in exchange for immunity. 
Right now that is your only option. 
You pull that trigger and that option is gone. 
Do you understand me? Gone. 
I'm no fool, Jack. 
They're never going to give me immunity after everything I've done. 
You don't know that. 
You don't know that for sure! 
Right now they are desperate. 
But either way, for you, this is over. 
Dad, it's over! 
There is no empire to protect. 
There's no legacy left. 
There is Marilyn, Josh and me; that's it. 
Please, Dad. 
I know you don't want to hurt Josh. 
I'm the one you want. 
You let Josh go... 
I will surrender. 
Come alone, unarmed, and I'll let Josh go. 
But if you bring anyone else into this, I will kill him. 
I understand. 
Hang up the phone. 
(speed dialing) WOMAN (over phone): CTU. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
I need you to send a team over to the Grandmont Hotel to pick up a hostile. 
He's been secured. 
He's in room 2132. 
Jack? 
Hey, I need to talk to you. 
About what? 
Morris. 
Not here. 
Look, he came and saw me in the infirmary... 
Look, I know he's been a little shaky. 
Has he been drinking? 
You smelled it on his breath? 
Yeah. 
I did, too. 
I already talked to him about it. 
He didn't metabolize the alcohol. 
He didn't metabolize the alcohol? 
I know it sounds weird, but it's true. 
He took a drink and he spit it back out. 
How do you know? 
Because he told me. 
And you believe him? 
I don't have to believe him. 
I was married to him-- if he was drunk, I would know. 
He's not drunk. 
He's been sober for three years. 
I didn't know he was an alcoholic. 
Now you know. 
And you don't think Buchanan should know about this? 
No. If he slips up again, 
I will personally tell Buchanan. 
Let's just leave it for now. 
Okay. 
Okay. I want you to wait here 
for Josh. 
Do you think your father will keep his word? 
As long as I keep mine. 
You know how to use this? 
Point and shoot. 
Once I get Josh, do you want me to call CTU and tell them to send help? 
No. 
I need to take care of this myself. 
Jack... 
thank you. 
Everything's going to be all right. 
Just wait here. 
I'm unarmed! 
Dad! 
I'm unarmed! 
Come out! I am unarmed! 
PHILLIP: That's close enough. 
Turn around. 
Now show me that you're not wearing an ankle holster. 
Take one step toward me for every step Josh takes away. 
Josh. 
Slowly. 
Your mother's waiting for you in the stairwell around the corner. Go. Go! 
That's it. 
Oh, Josh! 
Oh, God... 
Are you okay? 
Are you okay? 
Let's go. 
Go. 
I never meant for this to happen, Jack. 
I didn't have a choice. 
I don't know how exactly, but Gredenko found out about my role in David Palmer's assassination. 
So... he blackmailed me, 
forced me to cooperate. 
So it was Gredenko who had you divert some of the bombs the company was responsible for destroying? 
He's a radical nationalist. 
Told me that he wanted to preserve some of the arsenal for the day when the Soviet Union would be reestablished. 
I believed him because I had to. 
When did you find out he sold the bombs to Fayed? 
Not until one of the bombs was detonated in Valencia. 
That's the truth?! 
Absolutely. 
I've been looking for Gredenko ever since. 
So that I could find out what he knew about Fayed, and stop all this. 
I'm a patriot, Jack. 
I never wanted any harm to come to this country. 
You want to lie to yourself, you go ahead, but stop lying to me! 
You let all of this happen just so you could cover up what you did! 
(wry chuckle) You have all the smarts that Graem never had. 
You'd have handled Gredenko before this all got out of control. 
You know, none of this would have happened if you hadn't turned your back on me. 
So that you could become what? 
a civil servant. 
So... 
your people will use Gredenko to find this terrorist, and the truth will come out about all I've done. 
We never got Gredenko. 
Then all this was for nothing. 
On your knees. 
I didn't have to end like this, Jack. 
(gun chamber clicks) You could've had it all. 
I want you to know... 
...I never wanted you to feel 
like I had turned my back on you. 
That I had turned my back on the family. 
I just had to go my own way. 
Do things for myself. I... 
It was never good enough for you. 
I'm sorry. 
Anyway... 
I'm ready. 
What are you waiting for? 
Do it! 
Damn you! 
(phone rings) Yes? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
Who am I talking to? 
You must've exhausted all your options to find Gredenko. 
Who is this? 
It's Charles Logan, Jack. 
I might be able to help you, but we need to talk face-to-face. 
Where are you? 
I'm near the airport. 
Good, you're local. 
CTU knows where I am. 
Come and see me, Jack, as soon as possible And come alone. 
I'm looking forward to it. 
Curtis! Everyone back! 
OK, Jack. 
The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able to recover the most recently accessed file. 
Some kind of wire and schematic. 
How much of the file do we have? 
About a page and a half mostly in Arabic some of it Russian. 
Do you know what this is? 
This is a list... 
of electronic components for a nuclear device. 
 Hello? 
 Do you have the package? 
Not yet but I'll have it soon. 
Call me when you have it. 
Look, I don't wanna hurt him or you but I will unless you do exactly what I say. 
There's a package in there. 
I'm supposed to take it to a man who has an item for me. 
When you pick up the item, you call me in and I'll give you further instructions. 
There it is. 
Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this. 
I deleted those files. 
I wasn't right for them to arrest you for my action. 
You don't touch me! 
Leave him alone! 
 Sir, get back in line. 
 Not until you let go that man. 
Mr President. 
What do you want? 
You're holding 110 so called enemy combattants. 
at your Palmdale military facility. 
You must have all these freedom fighters on a non-military aircraft in the air by the end of the hour. 
If you don't release the prisonners by the deadline, the consequences will be devastating. 
Jack, a nuclear device has been diverted to a scientist with known terrorist ties. 
Pulling up the file now. 
 Do you recognize him? 
 Yes. 
I saw him with Fayed a year ago. 
His name is Numair. Hasan Numair. 
We need to know where this man is now. 
Hasan Numair is one of the terrorist being released from Palmdale military prison. 
Prisonner Numair, identify yourself now. 
Sargent, Numair is not on the plane. 
Repeat, Numair is not on the plane. 
Hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you. 
The following takes place between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. 
This escape was planned well in advance. 
 I agree, sir. 
 Fayed's demand for the release of the prisonners was a ploy. 
He never intended for us to fly Numair out of the country. 
He wanted him free inside our borders. 
 That's right, sir. 
 Do we have any idea where along the route Numair actually escaped? 
It had to be after the bus get on the highway. He must have had inside help. 
Is there anyone unaccounted for? 
Yes, sir. Our sargent is missing. 
We're looking for him now. I'll call you 
as soon I have any more information. 
Chloe, what about satellite? 
We have coverage of the bus Numair boarded but it's not continuous. 
There are 2 tunnels and three locations including this one where the coverage is only partial. 
Dammit. 
Numair is a known terrorist with possible access to suitcase nukes and he escapes in broad day light. 
We have to do better than we're doing and we have to do it faster! 
What else do we know about this prisonner Numair? 
He's a nuclear engineer trained in Germany. 
Run a weapons' program outta Frankfurt up until by 8 years ago when he moved to the Middle East. 
How relevant is his training to the existing systems? 
He knows it all. 
And he's up to date. If he gets his 
hands on the suitcase nuke  he can prep it on site. 
 I want this at the top of our list. 
Capturing Numair is our number-one priority. 
We won't be able to set up satellite parameters and that's to wide. 
I know... 
Partition the grid. 
Send half to me and the other half to Morris. 
 Morris? 
 Just do it. 
That's because we're monitoring the situation. 
As soon as I have anything in your on my end I will share it with you. 
 As soon as you... 
 Yes! 
What are you workin' on? 
Just setting up the image processing for CalTrans  in the area Numair escaped. 
 Dobbins can do that. 
 I need you on something else. 
 Now isn't the time to pull rank on me. 
Chloe has assigned me a task. 
Please find somebody else. 
Okay. 
Chloe... 
 What's Morris doing for you? 
 What're you talkin' about? 
I know he says he's on task for you but I need help with something. 
He's not doing anything for me. 
 Is this a joke? 
 You're upset. 
Our alert level is as high as it gets and you're playing games. 
If you can't work with me then you quit. 
Files are on your system. 
Filter them, now. 
I will. 
So now we have to assume there is a rogue nuclear weapon somewhere on American soil  or there will be soon. 
 All agencies are advised to proceed into that assumption. 
So what are we dealing with, Karen? 
Suitcase nukes. 
The term refers to a number of devices manufactured by the former Soviet Union. 
Small enough for one individual to carry and they have a yield of one kiloton or less. 
 Potential damage? 
 The kill radius of a typical suitcase nuke is about a half mile. 
The radiations from the blast greatly extends that radius depending on the prevailing winds and other weather conditions. 
Let's just arrive at the point here, Karen. 
How many casualties are we talking about? 
That depends on the population density. 
In a crowded city... 
many thousands would die instantly. 
Taking the radiation into account, the number of deaths and serious injuries would multiply into the hundreds of thousands. 
Get me Jack Bauer. 
Immediately. 
There's nothing here. 
We're wasting our time. 
You keep saying "we". 
There's you and there's us. 
There is no "we". 
Just give it a minute. 
Anything not fully incinerated can provide us with finger prints or traced DNA. 
 It's Bauer. 
 Hold for the President, please. 
 Yes. 
 Sir, Jack Bauer is on the line. 
Mr President. 
I wanted you to know that we're in the process of verifyin' what Assad told you  about his peace initiative. 
 Good. 
So far everything he told us has been true. 
He's given us no reason to doubt him. 
I hope you're right. 
Listen, I'm also calling because I want you to take charge of the search for Fayed and Numair. 
 Mr President, I... 
 After the way the country treated you this morning, Jack, I... 
Well... 
After the way that I treated you, I know I don't have any right to ask you anything. 
But you've been on top of this situation from the start and I just want to make it official. 
Mr President, the truth is... 
I don't think I'm up to it. 
Jack, we are behind the curve, as it is. 
But if weren't for your efforts today, we'd be nowhere. 
I need you to lead this search. 
Then I'll do my best, sir. 
Report to Bill Buchanan at CTU and call me any time you think it's necessary. 
 Yes, Mr President. 
 Thank you. 
The President wants me to run the search for Fayed and Numair. 
I can't do this without your help, Curtis. 
I need you to accept Assad as part of this investigation. 
He knows this people, he knows what to look for. 
He will see things that you and I would miss. 
He knows this people because he's one of them, Jack. 
Trust me. 
We need his help. 
I can't believe I'm hearing this. 
Time was you would have seen through this guy in a minute. 
What did the Chinese do to you? 
Is there something you need to tell me? 
Like what? 
Is there some kind of a history between you and Assad? 
They found this. 
 What is it? 
 It's a PDA damaged in the blast. 
 A message is still readable. 
 What's it sayin'? 
"Visitor arrived on Thursday." 
"Visitor" couldn't have been Numair. 
 He was still in custody then. 
 "Visitor" is a code word used within the cell. 
It to refers to weapon. 
A suitcase nuke. 
The message must mean that Fayed received it last Thursday. 
If they had the weapon last thursday, why did they need to get Numair outta prison now? 
He must be key to making the device operational. 
Get everything packed up, we need to go. Move. 
Nothing is more important than finding Fayed and Numair. 
Do you understand me? 
Yeah. 
 O'Brian. 
 Chloe, it's Jack. 
I need you to do something for me. 
I want you to run a crossed check on Curtis Manning and Assad. 
Is this important? 
I've got a lot on my plate right now. 
Curtis has a problem with Assad, it's personal. 
I don't know what it is but I need to get them to work together. Please. 
Okay, I'll do it as soon as I can. 
Numair is here. 
 My brother. 
 Fayed. 
 I was starting to worry. 
 Yes. 
The escape went as planned but I had to be careful crossing the city. 
Where is it? 
This was the last model the Soviets produced. 
Where are the tools? 
You're missing what I need to reprogram the trigger. 
The device will be here soon. 
By what means? 
A young man named Ahmed. 
Recent recruit but reliable. 
Ahmed, we have known you and your family for so long. 
I can't believe you want to be doing this. 
It's not what I want to do. 
It's what I have to do. 
I'm a soldier. 
You said your father knows nothing of this. 
When he finds out, will he be proud? 
 Yes. 
 Ahmed. 
 I have what you want. 
 Good. Now you're going 
to deliver it to a man named Fayed. 
 No. 
 What? 
No, I'm not going to deliver it anywhere until you let my family go. 
Ray, do what I say or I will shoot them. 
Well then I will destroy it and I have a feeling the people you're working for will be very disappointed. 
 Listen to me! 
 No, no, you listen to me! 
I just killed a man for this package and I'm not gonna deliver it anywhere until I know my family is safe. 
 I'll release one of them. 
 Both of them! 
If I do that I have no leverage and you know it. 
Decide now. Which one do I release? 
My son. Release my son. 
I will release your wife. 
 No, I just told you to release my son. 
 You just told me who you value most. 
Your wife will call you and she's clear off the house. 
Deliver the component and then I will release your son. 
That's it, Ray. Don't push your luck. 
All right. All right, let her go. 
Get in the car and drive. 
And call Ray and tell him that you're all right. 
This is the number that he called from. 
Will you remember this? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
Tell him to call me when you're through. 
And understand that if I see any police, I will shoot Scott. Do you understand? 
I love you. 
Go! 
 Gillian. 
 Ray? 
 Gillian, are you all right? 
 I'm fine. 
 What about Scott? 
 He's still with Ahmed. 
He says that if we go to the police that he's gonna kill Scott. 
But do you think that even if we do what he says that he would... 
You think he will still kill Scott when this is over. 
I don't know but we-- we can't take the chance of going to the police. 
 We have to handle it ourselves. 
 Oh, God! 
 I don't know. 
 Look, I'm gonna deliver the package like Ahmed said. 
He already let you go, so we have to tell ourselves that he's got no reason to kill Scott. 
Look... 
I'm gonna call Ahmed back. 
Do not call the police. 
Okay. 
 Honey, I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Hello. 
 Ahmed, I heard from Gillian. 
Good. Take the package 
to 351 Old Mill Road Valencia. 
Do you know where that is? 
 351, I can find it. 
 All right, I will call Fayed and tell him to expect you instead of me. 
Call me when you get there. It shouldn't 
take you longer than 30 minutes. 
 If it does... 
 I understand. 
I'm leaving now. 
911, what is your emergency? 
A terrorist is holding my son hostage. 
I need to speak to the police. 
Dammit, Morris. 
I didn't want this tab delimited. 
 I wanted it in tables like I told you. 
 I work much faster with tabs. 
I thought that is what you'd want. 
You know it's not what I wanted. 
You're just being an ass. 
Nobody speaks to me like this. 
No? I just did. So what? 
 Sit down and get back to work. 
 This has got to stop. 
Everyone is extremely busy and you two are distracting everyone around you. 
If you can explain to me how to get him to follow directions... 
You are on a power trip! 
You're a bull, mate! 
Excuse me. 
We all know what this is about. 
Milo, you and me dated a couple of times before Morris and I got back together. 
We saw a couple of good movies... 
but we both agreed that it wasn't really happening. 
Yeah. 
And you... 
So I dated Milo a couple of times. 
But I chose you. 
So why don't you get over it and stop trying' to beat him up? 
You think this is about my insecurities? 
Yeah. Isn't it? 
No. 
Okay, fine. 
If you want it in table format, you'll get it in table format. 
Let's just stop this mad psychotic terrorist bad guy before he detonates a nuke on Wilshire Boulevard. All right? 
Thank you. 
Sorry about that, mate. 
And just for the record... 
there's no lingering jealousy about any films you two may have seen together. 
No problem. 
 It's Bauer. 
 Jack, it's Bill. 
The police just vetted a call from a woman who claims her son is being held by a terrorist. 
 Is she credible? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
She says she was held too for a couple of hours but she got out somehow. 
 Is she on the line? 
 Yes. Her name is Gillian Wallace. 
Patch her through. 
Mrs. Wallace, this is Bill Buchanan. 
I'm transferring you to one of our men on the field. 
 Hello? 
 Mrs. Wallace, my name is Jack Bauer. 
You said your son is being held by a terrorist? 
Yes. And he's forcing my husband 
to deliver a package. 
 What kind of package? 
 II don't know. 
 Other persons are involved. 
 What's the name of the man  holding your son? 
 Ahmed Amar. 
Did he mention any other names? 
Yes, one. Fayed. 
Ma'am, how do we reach your husband? 
You can't, he isn't carrying his cell phone. 
Do you know where he was taking the package? 
No... I'm sorry. 
Whatever you do, just don't let them hurt my son. 
Ma'am, we'll do everything we can. 
Stay away from the house. 
We'll get back to you. 
What do you think, Jack? 
She knew Fayed's name. 
What's the location? 
North East corner of Channing and 15th, Grenada Hills. 
Where's your nearest TAC team? 
They're all over the city. 
You're as close as anybody. 
 Take your team with you. 
 Copy that. 
We have a lead? 
Hostage situation in Grenada Hills. 
They think it might be tied to the bombings. 
We need to go to 15th and Channing. 
We can't take him on tactical mission. 
We might need him when we get there. 
All teams, proceed to 15th and Channing Grenada Hills. 
Mr. President. 
It's good to see you again, Mr. Ambassador. 
 And yourself. 
 Please, sit. 
 How do you do? 
 Karen Hayes. 
 How do you do? 
 Tom Lennox. 
The events of these past few weeks are deeply distressing for all of us. 
If there's anything we can do to help, please tell me. 
You can help right now, Mr. Ambassador. 
By having a very candid conversation with us. 
I'm always candid, Mr. President. 
Mr. Ambassador... 
We've been in contact with Hamri Al-Assad. 
We know that he has been a driving force behind a number of terrorist attacks around the country. 
Around the world for the past two decades. 
I know who he is. 
Assad claims he's renounced terrorism, Mr. Ambassador. 
He says he's willing to negotiate. 
To use political means to gain his ends. 
You think he's telling the truth? 
I have reason to believe that he is telling the truth. 
But how much influence does he have? 
Does he speak for a large number of terrorist organizations? 
As you know, there are literally hundreds of such groups. 
But Assad's reputation is such that many of them not all by any means but a substantial number would follow his lead at least for a while. 
So this really could be a significant step towards peace? 
I sincerely hope so. 
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. 
 You've been extremely helpful. 
 You're welcome, Mr. President. 
 Thank you. 
 Mr. Ambassador. 
So this corroborates everything Jack told us about Assad. 
We need to formalize a relationship with him now. 
Lock him into cooperation. 
 Tom? 
 I have problems forming a partnership with a man who is responsible for the deaths of so many innocents. 
Is Assad still with Jack Bauer? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Let's get Jack on the phone, please. 
 Bauer. 
 Hold for the President, please. 
 Jack? 
 Yes, Mr. President. 
Do we have any leads on that nuclear weapon yet? 
One. We're following it up now. 
It's too early to tell if it's going to be meaningful. 
All right. Jack, listen. 
I just had a meeting that confirms Assad is serious about pursuing this negotiated peace. 
And that he does have the influence with his own people to make that happen, so... 
I'd like to come to some arrangement with him. 
 Is he with you now? 
 Yes, sir. 
Let me speak with him, please. 
One moment. 
The President wants to speak to you. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Mr. Assad, I am prepared 
to offer you full protection and a pardon for all crimes or acts of war in the past. 
There are conditions however. 
That you continue tracking Abu Fayed and that you pledge your commitment to establishing a broader peace. 
 Is that acceptable to you? 
 In principle, yes. 
Forgive me, Mr. President, but... 
I need to see this in writing. 
You'll have it within the hour. 
Let me speak with Jack, please. 
Of course. 
Yes, sir. 
This was not an easy thing to do, Jack, but I do believe the greater good requires it. 
Do you agree? 
I'm glad that's a call I didn't have to make, sir. 
Thank you, Jack. 
Yes, sir. 
Your President do you believe he's an honorable man? 
Yes, I do. 
Mr. Lennox, excuse me. I have 
Sandra Palmer calling for the President but he's on another line. 
Could you transfer that call to my cell phone, please? 
She specifically asked to speak to the President. 
And do it now, please. 
Yes, Sandra? Tom Lennox here. 
I need to speak with Wayne, it's important. 
I'm afraid the President's all tied-up at the moment.. 
Will you please let him know that I'm on the phone? 
Actually, the President asked not to be disturbed. 
Is this by any chance concern your friend Walid? 
Yes, that's exactly what it's about. 
He's still in custody. 
You continue to arrest innocent people, you're giving the terrorists exactly what they want. 
With all due respect, the President is more concerned by the fate of the country than the fate of one man, Sandra, so... 
An innocent man jailed without charges. 
If you believe the fundamental principles of this country, there is nothing more important than that. 
Well, you've got the makings of a splendid long review article there and will pass this message along to the President. 
 If you'll excuse me, please. 
 Mr. Lennox. 
Pass along another message as well. 
What is that, Sandra? 
I will do whatever it takes to protect my client. 
If it embarrasses the administration, so be it. 
Do I detect a threat here? 
Yes, and so is this: I am holding you personally responsible for whatever happens to Walid. 
Next, Sabir Hadad. Sabir Hadad. 
Walid Al-Rezani. 
Is there some place I can get a drink of water? 
Brother. 
Thank you. 
Thank you for helping me earlier. 
No problem. 
Did you tell them anything? 
 Of course not. 
 Good. 
I'll tell you something, brother. 
Before this day is over, they'll all pay. 
What do you mean? 
Salim. 
What are you doing? 
It's all right, he's a friend. 
Take-take it easy. 
I got a package from Ahmed, okay? 
Ahmed. 
Fayed. 
 Who is this? 
 He says Ahmed sent him. 
 Your name? 
 Ray Wallace. 
Ahmed should have called you and told you I was coming. 
You have to call Ahmed and tell him to let my son go. 
 Because we had a deal. 
 Quiet! 
Is this what you need to reprogram the trigger? 
Yes, this should work. 
How long will it take to complete assembling? 
20 minutes. 
So in a little less than an hour, it will detonate. 
A strike of blood that the Americans will never forget. 
You're insane. 
Don't kill him. 
until you're ready to leave. 
He still maybe of some use as a bargaining chip. 
if something goes wrong. 
Look... 
My son... 
He's-- just a boy. 
Can you call Ahmed and tell him to let him go? 
I mean I've done everything I've been asked to. Please. 
I may... 
if you remain cooperative. 
I will. I swear. 
I still have much to do as you know. 
I have everything I need. 
When you're finished, meet me at the safe house. 
 Yes. 
 Ahmed, it's me. 
 Did the device arrive? 
 Yes. 
But it was still wrong to involve anyone else. 
I understand and I know but I-I had to. I had no choice. 
 I... 
 Never mind. 
It arrived and that's what counts. 
You have a hostage  This man's son. 
 Yes. 
 You have no further use for him? 
 No. 
Then leave. Join the others. 
But before you go, kill the boy. 
 Is that necessary? 
 Yes. 
He's seen and heard too much. 
You understand? 
Yes, Fayed. 
The pardon for Assad looks satisfactory. 
 Tell the Attorney General to proceed. 
 Yes, sir. 
Yes. 
Mr. Lennox and Miss Hayes are here. 
Show them in. 
I've just approved the written agreement with Assad. 
 That was quick. 
 It had to be. 
We don't have the time to stand on ceremony. 
Tom, I know you disapprove of this agreement. 
But you have got to put that behind you. 
The issue now is how do we position this with the public. 
 It must be kept from the public. 
 That's not practicle, Tom. 
We will leak out. 
It's our advantage to make it known that Assad is on our side. 
Then don't disclose the formal agreement. 
Don't use the words "pardon" or "amnesty". 
 We're "cooperating". 
 I agree. 
Let's portray Assad as a man who's not a terrorist, but someone who's renounced terrorism and wants peace. 
 Terrorist turned statesman. 
 Well, he's not the first The point is saving lives. 
That needs to be our focus here. 
Okay, so for every life that was lost in the past because of this man 10 more may be saved in the future by working with him. 
All right, well on the face of it, if the logic is compelling. 
All right, let's make a set of briefing points and get them to our media people. 
I'm on it. 
I do have to say, Mr President... 
I still don't like this. 
I understand. 
And it makes me appreciate your loyalty all the more, Tom. 
The Wallace kid's still being held hostage. 
Copy that. Curtis... 
you and your team you take the back of the house. 
You come with me, we'll find an entrance point from the side. 
We'll go on my command. 
This is Bauer to all personnel, it is imperative we take the suspect alive. 
Right now he's our best chance of finding the nuke. 
Slowly moving into position now. 
All is clear. 
Cover me. 
Why aren't you talking? 
What's goin' on? 
Did my father deliver the package? 
 Yes. 
 Is he okay? 
Did he do exactly what you told him? 
Your father's fine. 
So... 
Then you can let me go, too. 
Get up. 
What? 
Get up! 
Why? 
My father did exactly what you told him to do. 
I swear I... 
I promise you I won't tell anybody what I know. 
Scott, don't make this any harder than it is. Kneel down. 
I can't see what's happening in the house. 
Does anybody have a visual on the situation inside? 
Not yet. My men are almost in position. 
 Turn around. 
 You don't have to do this. 
Turn around now! 
 Set. 
 All teams are set. 
Curtis, make the call. 
I'm sorry, Scott. 
Go! 
Freeze! 
 He's comin' your way, Jack. 
 Drop the weapon! 
Hold your fire! 
Hold fire! 
 Is he alive? 
 Barely. 
Get the EMT up here now! 
I need him conscious to tell us where he made the boy's father take the package. 
Get me an EMT down here now! 
I'm-I-I might know. 
Jack! 
When-when he was on the phone with my father he told him to take something to an address, hum... 
351 Old Mill Road Valencia. 
 Buchanan. 
 It's Jack. I think we got an address. 
351 Old Mill Road Valencia. 
Got it. 
Nadia... 
Alert the 2 tac teams, we have a strike target, deploy them there. 
You gonna save my dad? 
We'll do everything we can. 
When you got the satellite feed, download it to the tac teams. 
OK, I think we should get send'em here. 
Here is the satellite download to Fayed's location. 
They're only from the past 10 minutes but nobody entered or exited. 
What's the exterior layout? 
Favorable. Tac teams can approch 
without being seen. 
Nadia, get me the President. 
We just don't have enough specifics to go public. 
But I still want all 1st response teams in the Los Angeles area to be briefed on the possibility of a nuclear detonation. 
Excuse me, Mr President, you have an urgent call from Bill Buchanan. 
I'll take it. 
Mr President, we have some good news. 
We believe with a high level of probability  we can find the suitcase nuke. 
 Where? 
In Valencia, 20 miles north of the city. 
Tactical teams will be there in 15 minutes. 
Would you like me to patch you into that feed when it's available? 
Absolutely, Bill. 
Good work. 
Thank you, Mr President. 
I'll let you know when the feed comes up. 
Can we have a moment alone, please? 
 I'm getting you outta here. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Sandra, listen to me. 
I think some people in this place have a connection with the terrorist attacks. 
How would you know that? 
They were speaking Arabic, which I don't understand, but there was one phrase they used several times. 
Pass that on to the FBI or somebody. 
It may help They're being held illegally. 
Any statement they make  may not be in... 
 Dammit, Sandra! 
Stop being a lawyer for one damned minute. 
This guys may be planning something that will harm a lot of people. 
All right, I'll pass it on. 
I have to come back. 
Be carefull. 
Yeah, I just got it. Thanks, Bill. 
Let me know when the tac teams arrive in Valencia. 
Will do, Jack. 
This represents everything that you and the President talked about. 
You'll receive a full pardon in exchange for your continued efforts in helping us stop these attacks and for bringing your political organization to negociate in peace with the west. 
I need a moment to look through this, please. 
I understand. 
Unfortunately I need to get back to work. 
Agent Borman will take you to CTU. 
Good luck. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me. 
 What's the document? 
 Come here. 
I wanted to talk to you about this before it was executed. 
I didn't think it would happen this fast. 
We made a deal with Assad. 
 Who's "we"? 
 The United States government. 
Personally authorized by the President. 
Assad will receive a pardon in exchange for his full cooperation which he has given us. 
In other words... 
he walks. 
Like I told the President, it's not my call. 
It's not your call either. 
This possibility lies with him alone. 
It's out of our hands. 
All right. 
Then that's the way it has to be. 
That's the way it has to be. 
Yeah. 
Scott! Scott... 
Oh, God. Are you all right? 
 I'm fine. 
 You're sure? 
 Are you ? 
 Yes. 
Miss Wallace? 
Is there any word of my husband? 
With your son's help we think we know where he is. 
We've got agents on route. 
 Is he all right? 
 We don't know yet. 
As soon as they get there, I promise you we'll do everything we can to protect him. 
Excuse me for one second. 
 This is Bauer. 
 Jack? 
You were right about Curtis and Assad having a past connection. 
 Go on. 
 Curtis was in the army just after Desert Storm. 
His squad was embushed by Assad's people. 
They killed 5 of Curtis's men and took 2 more hostage. 
Curtis was badly wounded, he couldn't go after them. 
The next day a tape was sent to the local television stations. 
Assad's lieutenant forced the men from Curtis's patrol to beg for their lives and then personally beheaded them both. 
Oh, my God! 
Jack? 
I-I'll get back to you. 
Where's agent Manning? 
He was here just a second ago. 
Borom... Go ahead, I got him. 
You still don't remember? 
Special Forces batallion... 
32th support group Curtis, put your weapon down! 
I can't do that, Jack. 
By order of the President of the United States, put your weapon down! 
Stay out of it, Jack! 
I can't. 
I gave him my word that we would protect him. 
I didn't. 
Curtis, please. Don't do this. 
Please. 
I can't let this animal live. 
 Yeah. 
 Jack, it's Bill. 
Spreg told me what happened. 
Curtis didn't leave you any choice. 
That's what I keep trying to tell myself. 
You did the right thing. 
We need Assad alive. 
He's on his way back. 
I think you should come in, too. 
Tell the President I'm sorry. 
I can't do this anymore. 
The hell you can't. 
We're gonna find that suitcase nuke because of you. 
Jack, you've done great work today. 
Good, then you don't need me anymore. 
I'll send a car for you, Jack. 
Come back here, we'll talk. 
I'm done. 
 Yes ? 
 Mr Buchanan, I just received word that Ahmed Amar, the terrorist who held the Wallace family hostage, died on route to the hospital. 
Thank you, Nadia. 
Mr Buchanan, the tac team is ready. 
Patch me in. Make sure the White House 
is connected to the feed. 
Watch your 6. 
Here. 
 To mode set. 
 Go! Go! 
Delta unit, move in. 
Delta movin' in. 
Offensive, watch it, watch it. 
Engage! 
How much longer? 
Almost finished. 
I just need to reconnect the fuse. 
Sabir... 
 I think I saw someone out there. 
 Who? 
Police. Somebody. I saw something. 
 Are you done? 
 Yes. 
 Can you detonate now? 
 Yes. 
Right now! Do it! 
No. 
Oh, my God! 
Alert all fresh response teams in Los Angeles and the surrounding counties. 
Let's put them in touch with the military. 
Tell them... 
Tell them the resources of the entire nation are at their disposal. 
Whatever it is they need. 
Karen? 
Yes, Mr President. 
Mr Buchanan, I just got a message from the FBI. 
They said it's important. 
 It's some Arabic phrase. 
 What is it? 
Someone overheard a conversation at one of the detention centers. 
This phrase kept comin' up. 
I'm not sure about the pronunciation. 
It means "five visitors". 
Assad said "visitor" was a code word for weapon. 
Four more of theses things are out there. 
This is Bauer. 
Let me speak to Audrey. 
Her well-being's entirely up yo you, Mr. Bauer 
What we want is a component from the triggering mechanism the FB sub circuit board You give me the component I give you Audrey DOYLE: Stand down, Jack! 
I can't do that. 
I won't say it again. Drop it! 
Agent Doyle, I am following orders that exceed you're security clearance... 
He's a rogue agent. 
Take him out. 
It's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defense codes. 
JACK: I need the Chinese to believe that I'm willing to go through with this exchange. 
I will destroy the circuit board with a concealed charge of C-4. 
You're going to sacrifice yourself? 
Yes, sir, if I have to. 
You're asking me to sign off on a probable suicide mission. 
Mr. President... 
you owe me. 
JACK: I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards. 
CHLOE: I'm sending it to your system. 
The Russians have been trying to keep that technology out of Chinese hands for years. 
I did it for Jack. 
Well, what are the Russians going to say when they find out we just gave it to them? 
Well, it's not going to get that far. 
You have to tell Buchanan. 
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this operation. 
You've shown me I can't trust you. 
First I want to say that I'm grateful to report that all nuclear devices have been recovered. 
Based on the intelligence that I've seen, I can say with full confidence that-that-that that we will, uh... 
(groans) Get medical right away! 
Notify the Senate and the House of the transfer of power and the Sec Def and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs authorize me under the 25th Amendment. 
Wayne Palmer just issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand classified Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage. 
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese. 
Even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome. 
Tell CTU to stop Bauer. 
CTU has the signal. 
They're monitoring the device. 
We're set. Let's go. 
(phone ringing) Doyle. 
BUCHANAN: Noah Daniels is acting president. 
He wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU immediately. 
Understood. 
Don't you move. 
Jack... 
Slowly I want you to pull over. 
Now. 
This is going to end badly, Jack. 
You can't go against the White House. 
Wait! Wait! 
Stop! Stop! 
(horn honking) Stop! Stop! 
(tires screeching) Wait! Wait! Stop your car! Stop! 
Stop! 
Stop! Stop! 
What the hell?! 
Are you crazy?! 
I'm a federal agent in pursuit. 
I need the vehicle. 
Where's your badge? 
(horns honking) (tires screeching) (phone ringing) Pressman. 
Milo, it's Doyle. 
I need to speak with Buchanan. 
Hold on. 
Sir, Doyle's on line one. 
Mike, it's Bill. 
Do you have Jack in custody? 
No, he got the drop on me before I could get the component-- I screwed up. 
Where are you? 
I acquired another vehicle and I'm in pursuit. 
Morris, do you have Jack's position? 
Yeah. 
The tracker's still embedded in the sub-board. 
He's heading north on the 118. 
Copy that. 
Mike, Jack's going to disengage that tracker the first chance he gets. 
I'll get him before he does. 
All right, listen up. 
Jack Bauer has gone rogue. 
He has in possession the FB sub-circuit board. 
Mike Doyle is in pursuit. 
He needs all available resources to stop Jack and recover the component before he gives it to the Chinese. 
Chloe. 
I need you on task. 
You said that... 
I know what I said. 
I need my best people looking for Jack. 
Can I trust you to help me do that? 
Yes, sir. 
Good. Thank you. 
MORRIS: Oh, that's bloody marvelous. 
What? 
I just lost Jack's signal. 
How'd you do that? 
I didn't do anything. 
It just disappeared. 
(electrical wires crackling) CHLOE: There must be something in the transit ph. 
You don't have to state the obvious, Chloe. 
I know there's something interfering, I'm  trying to figure out what it is. 
CHLOE: This doesn't have to be personal. 
Can we just figure it out? 
It's not personal, and I've figured it out. 
This stretch of road runs right along the main voltage feed for the Valley, and Jack is using the power lines as a shield while he separates the tracker from the sub-board. 
Can you keep an eye on things? Can you? 
I have to explain this to Buchanan. 
Hey, I thought you got sidelined. 
Buchanan wants me to help find Jack. 
Which is going to be harder now that he's dumped the tracker. 
Did you pull up Caltrans? 
Yeah. 
I just can't believe that Jack would give up the circuit board to the Chinese. 
Jack would die before he gives up that component to the Chinese. 
I agree with you. 
The question is... would Jack 
give up Audrey's life? 
Exactly. 
Look, I'll... 
I'll check the satellites. 
See if they've restored any coverage in that area. 
If you find anything, send it to me, Doyle and LAPD. 
How much farther? 
We lost Jack eight miles north of your current location. 
We think he used the power lines as a shield while he removed the tracker. 
You're headed in the right direction. 
See you if you can pick up a trail. 
I'll call you back when I get closer. 
Thank you, Morris. 
All right. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief statement and I will not be taking any questions at this time. 
The President is en route to Bethesda Naval Hospital and will arrive shortly. 
The doctors have no idea whether or not President Palmer will come out of his coma in hours, days or weeks. 
Vice President Daniels will be addressing the country at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. 
Thank you. 
That's all, everyone. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
Tom... 
Yes, sir. 
Stick around. 
I want to talk to you. 
All right, sir. 
We need to clear the air, you and I. 
You still have evidence that could hurt me, and I'd like to know what your intentions are. 
Truthfully, sir, I haven't given it much thought. 
Why don't you think about it now. 
All right, sir. 
It concerns me that you engaged in conspiracy and perjury to achieve political ends. 
I don't think that's behavior befitting the acting president of the United States. 
Tom, the world has changed in the last half hour. 
Right now, this country, above all, needs stability. 
If I'm brought up on charges in the first hours of this presidency, then America's left without elected leadership. 
If I might just complete my thought, sir I made that tape both to back you off your challenge to President Palmer, but also to protect me. 
Now that was, and remains, my only reason. 
What about forcing my resignation? 
That was Wayne Palmer's idea, not mine. 
So... 
you're okay then with me in this chair? 
Sir, it's no secret that policy-wise you and I are in alignment. 
I just simply hate how we got here. 
Now that we are here? 
Yes, sir, you have my support. 
(sighs) In the event that we ever get out of alignment... 
I can't have you holding this evidence over my head. 
It's understood, sir. 
You have my word. 
All right, Tom. 
Glad to have you with me. 
Now what do you suggest we do with Karen Hayes? 
Will she slow us down? 
Of course she might, but she is smart, she brings balance. 
Fine, then she stays. 
Right. May I let her know, sir? 
Sure. 
Tom. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, sir. 
(phone ringing) Yes. 
This is Bauer. I just passed 
mile marker 49. 
I have the sub-circuit board with me. 
Good. Go east on 
the 118... 
No, from this point forward we do this my way. 
Don't test me, Mr. Bauer. 
Yes, I want the component, but Audrey Raines' life means nothing to me. 
Listen to me. 
CTU is looking for me. 
They want to stop the exchange from happening. 
I know their satellite coverage. 
I need to pick the location. 
All right. 
Where? 
There's an abandoned motel called the Calderone off of Highway 305. 
Come through the front door alone. 
We'll make the exchange there. 
We both have a chance to get what we want here, Mr. Bauer. 
Don't attempt anything foolish. 
We're leaving now, Ms. Raines. 
(speaking Chinese) I spoke with Bill, and he assures me that CTU has deployed all its resources to find Bauer. 
I don't want to hear about their assurances, Karen. 
They let Bauer steal the component, so their assurances mean nothing. 
Well, if I may, sir. 
I could authorize ancillary agencies to join the search. 
That would increase our chances of finding Bauer. 
Do it. 
Is there anything else you need from me? 
Is there anything else I need from you? 
Let me think. 
(sighs) I have the fate of the Western world and the lives of millions of Americans hanging in the balance and I can't... 
stop thinking about you. 
I'm not sure this is appropriate behavior, Mr. Acting President. 
Well, there's the phone, call to the media. 
Tell them the acting president's a dirty old man. 
They already know. 
I would like for you... 
to spend what's left of the night. 
I'll go home and pick up a change of clothes. 
Good. 
I'm at the Tampa exit by the power lines. 
It matches the last coordinates Morris had before the tracker stopped working. 
Mike, it's Bill. 
The White House is telling me if the Chinese get ahold of this sub-circuit board, we'll have an international incident on our hands. 
I know the stakes, Bill. 
Have you been able to figure out where Jack's headed? 
I'm working on it now. 
It looks like he headed east. 
What's up ahead? 
Two state routes, the 305 and the 98. 
Do you have satellite on both? 
No. The radiation 
from the fallout made that area hard to cover. 
But the 98 has Caltrans cameras I can check them. 
No, don't bother. 
Jack would know about those-- he's on the 305. 
And check the cell towers in the area. 
See if you can pick up a phone call between Jack and Cheng. 
And I think I saw Jack pick up one of the terrorist's phones at the warehouse-- that might help narrow things down. 
Chloe's got that grid on her system-- get it from her. 
Who's that? 
Doyle. He thinks 
Jack's on the 305. 
How would he know that? 
He figured it out. 
Chloe, I need you to pull the logs on grid 19-dash-12. 
Get everything off that cell tower for the last 15 minutes. 
What am I looking for? 
I think Jack's using one of the terrorist's phones that were tagged at the warehouse. 
Check all outgoing calls. 
We'll get it. 
Oh, um... 
what is this? 
Those are today's decryption schemes from the cell towers. 
I'm sending you some scrambled calls. 
We're looking for a conversation between Jack and Cheng. 
Why didn't you speak to me first before over-writing my screen? 
I don't know, that's just the way I did it. 
Okay, okay. We're being 
a little hostile, aren't we? 
Fine. 
I'm hostile, but I just didn't get there you pushed me halfway. 
Actually, you're right it's my fault, all my fault. 
I didn't say it's all your fault. 
I said halfway, 50%, point-five-- see, you don't listen to me. 
That's why I just sent it to your screen. 
Hey, guys. 
What's going on? 
My ex-wife is suddenly showing signs of irrational behavior. 
Okay. 
Do you know how to defrag Huffman keys? 
Yeah. Why? 
Can you help me out with this? 
Yeah. 
Great. I'll just send 
the files to your system. 
That's a really good idea. 
You should work with Milo you know, get cozy. 
Would you please stop acting like this? 
I really hate it. 
Why don't you write down the way you want me to act, put it in a file, tab delimited, the Milo loves it, and... 
shove it. 
Okay. I'll write it down 
the first item on the list would be: "Don't be such a jealous jerk." 
Okay. Um, the day I'm jealous 
is the day I kill myself. 
Is there anything else? 
How about: "Don't arm nuclear bombs for terrorists"? 
(exhales) Sorry. I didn't mean that. 
That's not how I feel. 
Yeah, it is. 
No, it's not. 
It just slipped out of my mouth. 
Morris... 
I'll call Mel over at the FBI, get them to share resources with Bill. 
(phone rings) Good, and I'll... Oh. 
Excuse me. 
Yeah? 
Okay. 
Well, tell him I'll be right there. 
That's strange. 
Peter Hock is in my office, and he wants to talk to me. 
Department of Justice? 
What is that about? 
I have no idea. 
Be careful, Karen. 
He's got a lot of clout on the Hill. 
I know. I'll call you. 
Peter. 
Early enough for you? 
(laughs) So, what's going on? 
It sounded urgent. 
You know that I've been interrogating Tom's chief of staff, Reed Pollock, after his arrest. 
That must be pleasant. 
(chuckles) Pollock's looking at a probable death sentence for his part in the assassination attempt on Wayne Palmer. 
Mm-hmm. 
Out of desperation, he's offering up everything he knows, hoping we'll show some leniency. 
And what does that have to do with me? 
Not just you, this involves your husband as well. 
Take a look. 
Listen to me, Peter. 
You and I both know that there are going to be endless hearings looking into how Fayedmanaged to acquire the nukes. 
PETER: And you know something about that? 
I can give you key information that will help keep blame away from this administration. 
PETER: I'm listening. 
POLLOCK: Well, I'm not saying anything until I have some sort of deal, in writing. 
He's such a weasel. 
We, uh, danced around for 20 minutes, then he... 
said this. 
I'm telling you... 
exactly what happened. 
Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody, and he let him go. 
PETER: And where's the proof? 
POLLOCK: Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland. 
That's a cover-up. 
And if you don't believe me, I have recorded conversations with Peter Iannone, Kurt Hueig and Myra Mawk, and they will all testify that she sequestered the file to protect her husband. 
Do me a favor, Karen. 
Save me some time. 
Is it true or not? 
The facts are true. 
But there's no cover-up here, Peter. 
About two years ago, we apprehended Fayed as part of an FBI-CTU border sweep. 
There wasn't enough to hold him, he was one of many, and he was maybe a mid-level player. 
And that turned out to be wrong. 
Fayed wasn't part of a cell; he wasn't funded. 
This all happened after he was released. 
So why was it blue-coded? 
Every year, thousands of suspects are arrested. 
If there isn't enough evidence to hold them, they're released and blue-coded-- that's just standard procedure. 
The only way to guarantee that no one becomes a threat is to hold everyone and deprive them of their rights and freedom. 
All right, Karen, then if this was a no-fault, why did this carry so much weight with you 12 hours ago. 
Why did you resign rather than have this come out? 
Come on, Peter, we were under attack. 
There was no way I was gonna let this information touch the president or my husband. 
They needed to lead us through this crisis unimpeded. 
Well, here we are, 12 hours later, Palmer's in a coma, the country's in shock after losing over 13,000 innocent lives, and all people are going to be asking is who let this happen? 
Well, certainly not my husband. 
He has devoted his life to this country. 
This isn't my call, Karen, but I think you know how this works. 
Someone's going to have to go down. 
And the farther from the president the better. 
So what exactly are you saying? 
It's going to be either you or Bill. 
Bill would be my preference he's lower on the food chain. 
But you'll do. 
(phone rings) Doyle. 
NADIA: We found Jack's call to Cheng. 
What'd he say? 
We haven't decrypted it yet, but the triangulation shows he's traveling north on the 305 just like you thought. 
Anything between me and Santa Maria? 
Uh, some small populated areas in the county, unincorporated. 
When does the next one come up? 
About nine miles from where you are now. 
All right, check it out, and keep working on that decryption. 
I want to know what Cheng and Jack said to each other. 
Okay. 
Are we converging on Jack? 
(phone rings) Yeah. Doyle's... 
Excuse me. Hi. 
KAREN: Hi. It's me. 
Do you have a minute? 
No. We're closing in on Jack. 
What is it? 
We have to talk about something. 
Why don't you call me when you have a few minutes. 
Okay. Everything all right? 
Just... do what you have to do 
and call me when you can, okay? 
All right. 
Bye. 
Yes? 
Well, Doyle's headed in the right direction. 
He can't be that far behind. 
We may have a chance to stop Jack before he reaches Cheng. 
He's traveling north on the 305. 
About there. 
Hey, let me call you back. 
Has CTU made any progress in locating Bauer? 
They're closing in, but they don't have him in custody yet. 
You were right about Hock, Tom. 
I need to talk to you. 
All right, shoot. 
Remember earlier when you threatened to use that information about Fayed to damage Bill and me? 
Karen, yeah, mea culpa. 
Wh-Why are we dredging this up now? 
No, no. 
Tom, it's not me. 
It's Reed Pollock. 
He's looking for anything to bargain his way out of the death penalty. 
Well, he can't. 
Well, whether he can or he can't, that ship has sailed. 
Hock knows now that we released Fayed from our custody two years ago in Seattle. 
Okay, okay. 
What does Hock want? 
Distance from the presidency. 
Ah, so in other words, either you or Bill has to take the blame. 
Yeah. But it's more 
than blame, Tom. 
There's gonna be inquiries, indictments, investigations lives will be ruined. 
Not lives, careers. 
Or rather, one career. 
And it can't be yours. 
Well, I can't do that to Bill, Tom. 
He's my husband. 
Well, he can go on being your husband, but he sure can't keep running CTU. 
(sighs) Well, if he goes, then I'm gonna resign. 
Haven't you already resigned once today? 
Karen, that's Bill's signature on Fayed's release document. 
Now, it's over for Bill. 
It's not for you-- I mean, you've got a job here. 
Just do it. 
(sighs) Tom, how can I ask him to step down? 
You don't ask you simply remind him that the man he personally let out of jail killed over 13,000 people this morning. 
Tom, he is not responsible for that. 
Karen, it doesn't matter. 
He has been amazing today! 
Look, look, look, the only way for you to protect yourself is to leave no doubt in anybody's mind where your true loyalty lies. 
Now, they got Bill in the crosshairs, okay? 
You want to stand shoulder to should with your husband, that's your call. 
(sighs) (sighs) (ringing) This is Bill Buchanan. 
If your matter is urgent, please dial zero. 
If this is not an urgent call, please leave a message at the beep. 
(beep) Bill, it's Jack. 
I'm about to meet with Cheng and exchange the FB sub-circuit board for Audrey. 
Hopefully, by the time you hear this, she'll be safe and in your custody. 
Bill, I know I promised the president that I would give him confirmation that the circuit board did not fall into the wrong hands. 
This message is your confirmation. 
The circuit board will be incinerated in the explosion. 
The meeting will take place at the Calderone Motel off of Highway 305. 
Bill... 
Please take care of Audrey. 
And thank you. 
You've been a good friend All right, Marcy. I'll talk 
to you in the morning. 
Yeah. 
You have a second? 
What is it, Morris? 
I'd like to request a transfer. 
Why? 
I need to get out of Comm. 
You want to elaborate on that? 
Not really, no. 
You and Chloe having problems? 
You could say that, yes. 
I really hate to lose you in Comm. 
Can we talk about this in the morning? 
Nothing's gonna change. 
You don't know that, Miles. 
I do. 
Look. Please. 
Figure out where you want to put me. 
Anywhere is fine. 
Just get me out of Comm. 
All right. 
We'll work something out that, uh, that's good for everyone involved. 
Thank you. 
(phone ringing) Hi, honey. 
Hey. 
I have a minute. 
Did you want to talk about something? 
Bill, the DOJ investigator found out about Seattle, when you and Homeland had Fayed in custody. 
"Found out"? 
It wasn't a secret. 
We did everything by the book. 
I can deal with DOJ. 
Yeah, I know, but... 
The problem is, they're out for blood, Bill. 
I can't let this touch me. 
Touch you? What are 
you talking about? 
Bill, I... 
Why is this suddenly an issue? 
Are you concerned I might implicate you? 
No. No, but obviously there's 
guilt by association here. 
They're looking for a scapegoat. 
Yes. The pundits and 
the press are looking for anything to attack the administration. 
What are you saying? 
I have to protect the White House, Bill. 
and in order to do that, I have to distance myself from you. 
How are you going to do that? 
I'm your husband. 
You asking me to resign? 
No, Bill. 
I have to fire you. 
There's pressure on you, Karen. 
Look, this is the only way this can work. 
And it has to happen immediately. 
or I'll be viewed as complicit and my ability to stay on as national security advisor will be undermined. 
Undermined? 
We're talking about the end of my career. 
You don't think that I've thought this through? 
No, I don't. 
You don't think that I don't know what this means to you? 
No, I don't. 
Bill... 
Because the public will make assumptions that don't exist. 
13,000 American lives lost. 
I had the man in custody who was responsible, and I released him. 
It won't matter that I had no evidence to hold him. 
Look, you know how this works. 
One of us has to take the fall, and it can't be me. 
I'm too close to the president. 
I can't believe I'm hearing this. 
Who is pressuring you, Karen? 
What are you not saying? 
You have to trust me on this, honey. 
We will get through this, I promise. 
And... I love you, and that's 
all that should matter here. 
Is it? 
Yes. 
(phone ringing) (hangs up) Why is it taking so long with Jack's phone call to Cheng? 
It just is, Mike. 
He used a double-length key to slow us down. 
We're going as fast as we can. 
All right, I'm off the highway. 
Mile Marker 19. 
Checking surface streets. 
(ringing) Hello, Valley Cab Company. 
May I help you? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm a counter-terrorist agent. 
This is an emergency. 
I don't see any sign of Jack. 
What's further north of here? 
Nothing but national forest for 32 miles. 
He could be in the Central Valley by now. 
Wait. I might 
have found something. 
I'll get back to you. 
Okay. 
Nadia. 
Has Doyle found Jack yet? 
Well, he might have a lead. 
He's checking it out now. 
All right. 
Come with me. 
I'm stepping down as director of CTU. 
What? 
What happened? 
All I can say is I have to step down. 
No. Sir, that 
doesn't make any sense. 
Why would you quit now of all days? 
I'm not quitting. 
I was fired. 
By who? 
It doesn't matter. 
I've contacted Division. 
For now, you're acting director. 
Mr. Buchanan. 
We've been ordered to escort you off the premises. 
I know. 
I'm briefing Ms. Yassir. 
She's taking over as head of CTU. We'll need 
one more minute, please. 
One minute. 
Sir, we're in the middle of 50 different things here. 
Why would they do this to you now? 
I can't talk about it. 
You need to accept it and do the best you can. 
No. I don't understand 
why they would fire you. 
You're the most ethical, dedicated person I've ever known. 
There's no way you did anything to justify this, Damn it, Bill, what is going on? 
It's just politics. 
Division will be sending over an interim director in the next few hours. 
In the meantime, you can handle anything that comes up. 
What about the extra redundancies and everything else I've had to go through today? 
I'm not the right choice to take over. 
I've lifted all the restrictions on your security clearance. 
You shouldn't have any trouble running CTU. 
You are the right choice. 
I don't know what to say. 
Just stay on top of the situation with Jack. 
I will. 
No one else knows I'm leaving You have to inform them before it's posted on the internal forums I'll tell them. 
What you said means a lot. 
(phone ringing) O'Brian. 
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, got it. 
Doyle just called in. 
He's found Jack's truck. 
Good, Morris. 
What's happening to Buchanan? 
He's gone. 
What do you mean, he's gone? 
I'm in charge. 
Can I have everyone's attention, please? 
In a few minutes you're gonna be getting a bulletin on your systems. 
Bill Buchanan has stepped down, which means that until Division can send over a replacement, he's named me acting director. 
Nothing will change operationally. 
Your objective remains the same Bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over the component to the Chinese. 
Thank you. 
CTU, this is Doyle. 
Do you copy? 
Doyle, you're on com. 
Go ahead. 
Do you have anything on satellite yet? 
MILO: Spotty. 
Well, I found our truck. 
Either Jack switched vehicles or he parked it and he's nearby. 
I'm gonna go look at the buildings. 
All right, there's some infrastructure around we can check using thermal. Chloe? 
I'm on it. 
Hang on. We might 
not need it. 
What do you mean? 
A limo just pulled off the highway. 
Redirect all nearby units to my current location. 
Okay. 
Send Alpha and Delta teams to that location. 
Also send Air One, Two and Three for air support. 
All right. 
Cheng just left the car. 
Far enough. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Where's Audrey? 
She's in the car. 
Until I get the component... 
Nothing's going to happen until I see Audrey. 
I want to make sure she's all right. 
(speaks Chinese) She's coming in now. 
Audrey Raines is entering the premises. 
I think I'm gonna need that backup. 
You have the sub circuit board? 
You'll get it as soon as I know she's safe. 
(speaks Chinese) Take the gag out of her mouth. 
Wait! 
I'll do it. 
(speaks Chinese) (whispering): I'm so sorry. 
CHENG: You can continue this reunion later. 
How is this gonna work, Mr. Bauer? 
Audrey walks out of her alone. 
As soon as I see that she gets down near the bridge I'll know she's out of the range of your sniper. 
Then I'll give you the component. 
There's at least ten guns. 
I need the field teams. 
Let's do this. 
I want you to walk past the bridge a hundred yards, on the right side of the road, do you understand? 
There's a gas station, and a cab will be waiting for you. 
He has instructions to take you back to CTU. 
You need to go. 
Go. 
All right, this is going down now, Nadia. 
Where are the field teams?! 
They should be there any minute. 
I need to do something now. 
They're releasing Audrey which means Jack is about to hand over the component. 
Mike, don't let that happen. 
Give me the circuit board or I'll kill her. 
Oh, damn it! 
(tires squealing) Miss Raines, stay where you are. 
Stay down! 
(men shouting, gunfire continues) (speaks Chinese) CTU, this is Air One. 
Do you copy? 
Go ahead. 
Cheng and his men have escaped. 
They're in three black Hummers heading north towards the mountains. 
Traveling off road. 
Pursue and engage. 
We've been hit! 
We're going down! 
I repeat, we're going down! 
(engine sputtering) * * Agent Bauer, get down! 
My weapon is down! 
Get on the ground! 
Get on the ground! 
Who is your commanding officer?! 
I am, Jack. 
Stand him up. 
Where's the sub-circuit board? 
Cheng's got it. 
I was set to blow the building and destroy the component until you engaged us in a firefight. 
Here's the detonator. 
What's the problem? 
We don't have Cheng, Jack. 
What do you mean, you don't have him? 
The assault teams didn't have time to get into place. 
We had to make a frontal assault. 
He must have escaped out the rear. 
Nadia, did you get that? 
Cheng escaped with the sub-circuit board. 
We got a chopper down. 
We need those other choppers ASAP. 
I know. The chopper should be 
there in five minutes. 
Listen, before they went down, they reported seeing Cheng and his men traveling in three black Hummers in the mountains off road traveling north. 
Copy that. 
Now place Jack under arrest. 
Understood. 
Is he gone? 
Yeah. 
I gotta take you into custody, Jack. 
I had this handled. 
Why the hell didn't you listen to me? 
Audrey, it's over. 
It's all right. 
You're safe. 
Help me, Jack. 
Please don't let them do this to me. 
Audrey... 
Help me, Jack, don't let them do... 
Audrey! 
It's me. I'm right here. 
Do you even know who I am? 
DOYLE: Sit her down. 
They've done something to her. 
You got to help her, please. 
We will. Let's go, Jack. 
Please. 
(indistinct muttering) My God. 
We have a successful launch. 
a general in our central command General Mohmar Habib, who has also been in contact with Fayed. 
He's been helping orchestrate the attacks on your country. 
I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of World War III. 
I've never found pharmaceutical torture all that affective. 
I have. 
If this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time. 
I won't tell you a thing. 
Watch out! 
BUCHANAN: We staged a fake rescue of Fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib. 
He wants us to help you rendezvous with your men. 
Where do you want us to take you? 
If you take your orders from General Habib as I do, how is it I've never heard of you? 
Fayed's gone! 
Jamal's still alive. 
Stay with him, call in a medic. 
CTU, the bombs are secure. 
Hello? 
AUDREY: Jack, are you there? 
Can you hear me? 
Audrey. 
Help me, Jack. 
Hello, Mr. Bauer. 
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive. 
If you wish her to remain that way, you will call me back in ten minutes. 
If you make any attempt to find our location, she dies. 
(dial tone) Cheng. 
Captioning sponsored by 20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION and... FORD. 
Every day, someone, somewhere makes a bold move. 
There's a car company for people like that. 
Agent Bauer, you really do need to get to a hospital. 
But I understand the circumstances. 
At least this will help you with the pain. 
Thank you. 
Hey, Jack, so the Marines, they're going to secure the nukes and prepare them for transport. 
They're calling the shots now. 
The military's taking over? 
Yeah, according to presidential order. 
I guess DOD doesn't want CTU in charge anymore. 
So Buchanan, he wants you to call him as soon as the nukes are ready for transport to a NEST facility. 
Can you handle that for me? 
Sure. 
Jack? 
What? 
I just... I know you've 
been through hell. 
Not just today, but the last couple of years, and... 
I just wanted to thank you for what you did today, 'cause it could have ended a hell of a lot worse. 
And it would have if you weren't here. 
I appreciate that. 
Excuse me. 
Agent Doyle, Highway Patrol's finished locking down all the roads, and they're awaiting your instructions. 
(groans) (phone rings) Yes. 
This is Bauer, let me speak to Audrey. 
You've already spoken to her. 
I want to make sure she's all right. 
Her well-being is entirely up to you, Mr. Bauer. 
Everyone has given up on you. 
Everyone, except for Ms. Raines. 
Over the objections of your government, her family, her friends, she came to Beijing, just to find you. 
Since you proved to be a uncooperative prisoner, we felt she would be an asset we might be able to exploit one day. 
And that day is here. 
I will hand myself over to you. 
Tell me where. 
A man who won't break is of no use to us, but the Russian suitcase nukes you captured... 
Why? 
Your country has the technology to build those weapons. 
It's not the weapons themselves we're interested in. 
What we want is a component from the triggering mechanism. 
It contains a prototype algorithm... 
old enough to be free of any modern decryption safeguards. 
With it, we'll have access to virtually all Russian defense technology. 
It's a simple exchange. 
You give me the component, I give you Audrey. 
If you refuse, I kill her. 
The Russians will know that we supplied you with the algorithm. 
You would be starting World War III. 
I suggest we leave that to the diplomats to sort out. 
Even if I wanted to, the bombs are under military control. 
I couldn't get anywhere near them. 
You'll find a way. 
If I'm going to agree to this, I want to speak to Audrey now. 
Very well. 
Speak to him. 
Jack? 
Audrey. 
Are you all right? 
Did they hurt you? 
No. 
Jack... I... 
I'm sorry. 
You have nothing to be sorry for. 
The only thing that's important is that you're alive. 
I know what they're asking for. 
I can handle it. 
I promise you, I'm going to get you out of there. 
Just don't be frightened. 
You have one hour to call this number when you're ready to make the exchange. 
An hour's not going to give me enough time. 
Cheng. 
Cheng! 
You know, you really should work from Medical, sir. 
Come on, at least they can monitor you there. 
I'm fine, Tom. 
I... I don't think 
that you are, sir. 
And neither does Dr. Welton. 
Putting myself under medical supervision might give the vice president yet another pretext to try and take a run at my job. 
You don't need to worry about that, sir. 
What exactly do you have on Vice President Daniels? 
I have the truth, sir. 
Now is the time that I need to know what that is. 
It is a tape recording of Vice President Daniels conspiring with Lisa Miller to commit perjury at your competency hearing. 
I'd love to hear that as soon as possible. 
HAYES: Mr. President, Tom. 
I have good news. 
CTU has recovered the two remaining suitcase nukes. 
When? 
Just a few minutes ago. 
I just got off the phone with Bill. 
He's waiting to brief you as soon as you're ready. 
What about Fayed? 
He and his men were killed during the assault. 
Then it's over. 
Well, it certainly seems so, sir. 
Congratulations. 
The American people should know. 
And I want to tell them that we're no longer at risk of a nuclear attack. 
I'll have the press corps down here in 30 minutes. 
No, no, Karen. 
We're going to do this from upstairs, in the press room. 
Should we wait for clearance from Secret Service? 
No, Tom, there's no need for any of us to be hiding underground for a minute longer. 
Inform Secret Service that we'll be leaving the Bunker and returning to the Oval Office. 
HAYES: Yes, sir. 
Morris is coordinating with the Marines Technical Escort Unit to transfer the bombs to a NEST facility. 
Now that they've taken custody, I'd like you all to submit your briefings to the respective department heads. 
(phone ringing) I'd like to share my pride in the work that you've all done. 
We were hit hard. 
But not one of you gave up. 
You've done excellent work today. 
O'Brian. 
Hey, it's me. 
Jack. You did it. 
Chloe, listen to me. 
I need your help. 
Well, can't it wait? 
We're just transferring the bombs, and doing cleanup. 
No, it can't. 
What is it? 
Chloe, Audrey's still alive. 
No, she's not. 
Yes, she is, I just talked to her. 
The Chinese faked her car accident. 
They've been holding her a prisoner since she was in Beijing trying to find me. 
Oh, my God. 
We have to tell Mr. Buchanan. 
He'll never go along with it. 
Go along with what? 
The Chinese want to exchange Audrey for an FB-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes. 
It'll give them complete access to Russian defense technology. 
I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards. 
Jack, we both know that if we do this, it will create an international situation big time. 
Chloe, I know. 
I promise I will do whatever I have to to stop the Chinese from getting that circuit board. 
But right now I need you to get me the schematics for those bombs. 
Those files aren't on my system. 
They were reclassified when the DOD took possession of the suitcase nuke you disarmed. 
Then you're going to have to figure out a way to get them, 'cause without those schematics, I won't know what I'm looking for. 
Yes, I understand, but I don't know how I can do this. 
Chloe, Audrey's life is at stake. Think. 
Wait. 
Morris. 
He had to file a report with DOD about the work he did on the nukes. 
It contained a revised schematic. 
It might still be on his hard drive. 
Can you access it? 
Only directly from his terminal. 
Chloe, please, do it. 
Where do you want me to send it? 
To the cell phone that I'm calling you from. 
Use a secure line-- Alpha-539. 
Hold on. 
It's here. 
The file's coming up. 
I'm sending it to your screen. 
Stand by. 
Copy that. 
Come on. 
Chloe, I don't see anything. 
It needs to load before it sends. 
There's still 30% to go. 
Damn it. 
What? 
Morris is coming back to his station. 
Hurry. 
There's nothing I can do. 
I need to log out now. He's here. 
No, Chloe, wait. 
Jack... 
I got it. 
(phone beeps) Yes? 
OPERATOR (on phone): Mr. President, 
the vice president is here. 
Send him in. 
Noah... 
Please sit. 
Listen, I, uh... 
I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to you. 
For a lesson well learned. 
I'm not sure what you mean by that, Mr. President. 
I still believe attacking Abu Fayed's country with a nuclear weapon would have been a serious mistake, Noah; I'm not going lie to you about that. 
But... 
if you hadn't put that option on the table in the first place, I never would've gone as far as I did. 
And the bombs might still be out there. 
That being said... 
I think we would both agree that our relationship has always been a marriage of convenience. 
A way to strengthen the ticket, rather than a case of us actually seeing eye to eye on pretty much anything. 
And now that it's over, this crisis, it's become clear to me, Noah, that I just don't think it's possible for us to work together anymore. 
Excuse me? 
I'm asking for your resignation. 
How dare you. 
You don't have the right to ask for my resignation. 
This isn't about what the Constitution says, Noah. 
It's about what's best for this country in a time of crisis. 
How in the world do you figure that? 
I can't lead effectively with you undermining me at every single opportunity that you may get. 
Now let's be honest with each other. 
That's exactly what you would do if you stayed in place. 
Mr. President... 
I refuse. 
Good night. 
You don't want to walk out that door. 
Not like this. 
Otherwise I may have to make this extremely unpleasant for you. 
Now what are you talking about? 
I'm talking about the recording that Tom Lennox has in his possession. 
That's what I'm talking about. 
Conspiracy to commit perjury is a serious offense. 
Now I have to assume you'd rather resign, than spend the rest of your life living with that kind of humiliation. 
So is resorting to blackmail your idea of effective leadership? 
If there is anything I've learned anything from you, Noah, it would be that sometimes it's necessary to apply a little brute force. 
I don't need your resignation immediately. 
Let's give the country a chance to take a breath after what happened today. 
Some time in the next week will be just fine, Mr. Vice President. 
NEST wants a flight path cleared to Edwards for 20 miles in each direction. 
Could you get back to me with confirmation? 
Thank you. 
ETA on the helicopter that will transport the bombs is 15 minutes. 
You should distribute protocols to the NEST team. 
I'm on that. 
(keyboard clacking) (computer beeps) That's odd. 
What? 
I think someone's hacked into my system. 
Are you sure? 
Yes, I'm sure. 
Ever since what happened to Nadia, I installed a logging program to track any unauthorized access to my hard drive. 
You did? 
It's telling me that someone accessed my files ten minutes ago... 
and downloaded the updated schematics to those suitcase nukes. 
I'm calling security. 
Wait! 
Don't call security. 
(hangs up receiver) I'm the one who hacked into your system. 
Why would you do that? 
I'll explain it to you in a little while. 
Explain it to me now. 
I did it for Jack. 
Audrey Raines is still alive. 
The Chinese are holding her hostage. 
What? 
They're going to kill her unless Jack delivers an FB-sub-circuit board from one of the bombs to them. 
You've been to all the same briefings. 
The Russians have been trying to keep that technology out of Chinese hands for years. 
I know. 
Well, what are the Russians going to say when they find out we just gave it to them? 
It's not going to get that far. 
How in the world do you know it's not going to get that far? 
Because Jack gave me his word. 
I'm sorry, darling. 
I can't leave it at that. 
Yes, you can. 
The bombs that I reprogrammed for Fayed could have killed tens of thousands of people. 
But that didn't happen. 
I know what it felt like to think that I could've been responsible for each and everyone of their deaths. 
I can't be involved with something that could easily end up starting a war. 
It's not going to start a war because it's not going to get that far. 
Besides, this has nothing to do with you. 
I did it. 
Yes, it does. 
Now that you've told me, it does. 
You have to tell Buchanan. 
I can't. 
Then you're forcing me to. 
No. 
I'm going to do it. 
No! Morris! 
I'm doing it. 
I'll tell him. 
Reinforcements aren't necessary at this point. 
The military is guarding the bombs. 
There's a CTU SWAT team standing by. 
They'll be en route soon. 
All right, thank you. 
What is it, Chloe? 
Mr. Buchanan... 
I'm sorry, there's something that you need to know. 
* * You two, come with me. 
Sir, this area's off-limits. 
I'm Agent Bauer. 
I was the man that was responsible for securing these nukes. I'm under 
a presidential order to remove the FB-circuit board from one of these bombs, have it transferred back to CTU for immediate analysis. 
We don't have much time. 
This building has been compromised. Now open 
the gate. 
Sir, no one is allowed in here. 
Are you countermanding a presidential order? 
How dare you, Sergeant?! 
Now you're wasting my time. 
What's your name? 
What's your name?! 
I want your name, too. 
Now! 
That's not necessary. 
Open the gate. 
Open the gate! 
I want both of you to stand guard while I remove the circuit board. Come on! 
One, two, three... 
DOYLE: Stand down, Jack! 
I can't do that. 
I won't say it again! 
Drop it. 
Agent Doyle, I am following orders that exceed your security clearance! 
He's a rogue agent. 
Take him out! 
I will shoot! 
Put your weapon down or I will shoot you! 
Take him! 
Now! 
(blow lands) Secure him, he's under arrest. 
Doyle, please. 
Just listen to me. 
DOYLE (over phone): Bill, we've got Jack. 
What did he say? 
Not much. I had 
to subdue him. 
Let me talk to him. 
Hold on. 
Buchanan wants to talk to you. 
Bill... 
Jack, Chloe just told me about Audrey and the Chinese. 
I can't let you give them the component. 
I'm not going to. 
I only need to have it long enough for them to let her go. 
I was never going to let the Chinese keep it, Bill, I swear to you. 
Whatever you have planned, Jack, I can't let you do it. 
Bill, please... 
Right now we're the only chance she's got. 
I understand what Audrey means to you. I promise 
I will do everything in my power to get her back. 
You didn't even know she was alive. 
Cheng is going to make it impossible for us to ever find her again. 
We are her only hope and you know it. 
I don't know what to tell you, Jack, except let Doyle bring you back here and we'll work out a game plan. 
Will you let me make one more call? 
I'm asking you as a friend. 
Who do you want to talk to? 
President Wayne Palmer. 
I'll see if I can reach him. 
Let me talk to Doyle. 
Yeah. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Doyle. 
Keep Jack in custody while I try to contact the president. 
I'll route the call through your cell. 
Yes, sir. I understand. 
Get him up. 
(Bauer panting) WOMAN (on TV): White House sources have confirmed that terrorist leader Abu Fayed is dead. 
The president has reportedly recovered from injuries sustained from the failed attempt on his life, and he is expected to make a statement shortly regarding unconfirmed rumors... 
(beeps) Yes? 
MAN: Mr. President, Bill Buchanan 
has Jack Bauer on the line. 
Put him through, please. 
(beeps) Go ahead. 
WOMAN: Please hold for the President. 
It's the president. 
Excuse me. 
Mr. President. 
Yes, Jack. 
Congratulations. 
Is everything still all right? 
Yes, sir. The bombs are secure. 
But I'm calling because I want you to authorize a field operation. 
For what purpose? 
To save Audrey Raines. 
What? 
Mr. President, 
she's still alive. 
The Chinese have been holding her for the past few months. 
Now they're using her as a bargaining chip. 
In exchange for what? 
For an FB-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes. 
They say they'll release Audrey unharmed if I bring it to them. 
It's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defense codes. 
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that. 
I'm sympathetic, I am, and I promise you that I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, but I hope you're not expecting me to authorize this exchange. 
Not exactly. 
Then what exactly? 
Mr. President, 
I need the Chinese to believe that I am willing to go through with this exchange. 
I need to have that component on me. 
They're going to need to see it. 
As soon as I know that Audrey is free, I will destroy it. 
And how can you guarantee that? 
I'm asking you to trust me, Mr. President. 
I give you my word that that component will not end up in Chinese hands. 
But if it does, the Russians, despite our peace accord, may take action against us for allowing it to happen. 
Now, under most circumstances, yes, your word would be sufficient, but in this case, Jack, I need to know details. 
If I have to, I will destroy that circuit board with a concealed charge of C-4. 
An explosion of C-4 would take out anything within 30 feet of it. 
You're going to sacrifice yourself? 
Yes, sir, if I have to. 
Jack... 
Mr. President, please. 
Please, I am begging you. 
Audrey Raines was willing to give up her life to save mine. 
I cannot and will not do anything less for her. 
You're asking me to sign off on a probable suicide mission. 
With all due respect, Mr. President, 16 hours ago, 
your people were willing to hand me over for dead, and I did not hesitate. 
Mr. President, you owe me. 
And you're sure this is the only way? 
Yes. 
All right, then. 
I will not fail you, Mr. President. 
I'll tell Bill to give you whatever you need. 
Now I'm going to need confirmation that circuit board has been destroyed after Audrey has been released. 
I'll have CTU embed a tracking device in the board. 
You'll have your confirmation. 
Good luck, Jack. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me speak with Bill Buchanan. 
Yes, sir. I understand. 
Get over here. 
What did he say? 
Buchanan said the president signed off on this, and to give you whatever help you need. 
I'm going to need someone to help me with Audrey's extraction during the exchange. 
I want that to be you. 
Fine. 
Where are you going to be? 
The name of the Chinese agent that's holding Audrey is Cheng Zhi. 
He was responsible for my interrogation and torture for almost two years in that Chinese prison. 
As soon as I get the signal from you that Audrey is safe, two things are going to happen. 
I'm going to destroy that circuit board, and Cheng Zhi isn't going to make it out of here alive. 
So, in answer to your question, where am I going to be? 
Wherever I have to. 
Let's go. 
Are you going to tell me what happened? 
The president agreed to Jack's plan. 
The president's going to allow Jack to hand over a defense algorithm to the Chinese? 
No. Of course not. 
Jack will destroy the component as soon as he knows Audrey's safe. 
The Chinese will never get it. 
And how is he going to manage that? 
I don't know. 
I guess President Palmer trusts him. 
Telling Buchanan was the right thing to do. 
You know it was. 
It doesn't matter. 
You should have trusted me. 
Trusted you? 
You're the one that broke into my system. 
That's because I didn't think you'd back me up. 
Obviously, I was right. 
So you're going to hold this over my head now, are you? 
Yeah. For a long time. 
For how long? 
Could you give me an estimate? 
I'll get back to you. 
Nadia, Doyle's on line three. 
They're going to lock you on the tracker frequency. 
This is Nadia. 
It's me. 
The tracker's on line. 
The frequency marker is Alpha-1793. 
Signal's good. 
You're on the grid. 
Copy. Jack and I are 
getting ready to move out. 
(phone rings) Yes? 
I have the circuit board. 
Where am I going? 
Get on the 180 and head north. 
Get off the first exit after mile marker 49. 
I will give you further instructions when you've exited. 
I got it. 
You have a half an hour. 
I don't think I need to remind you what would happen if you are late. 
I understand. 
CTU has the signal. 
They're monitoring the device. 
I'm set. Let's go. 
Jack, you're taking a hell of a risk. 
If this goes sour, it could stir a firestorm. 
And for what? 
If you were in my shoes, you wouldn't do the same thing? 
I don't mix relationships with my job. 
Whatever you had with this woman, I hope it's worth it. 
This isn't about what I had with a woman. 
Her name is Audrey Raines. 
She served this country with honor. We owe her. 
So get in the truck. 
(knocking on door) Come in. 
You wanted to see me? 
Close the door. 
The president has just asked me to resign. 
What? 
And I'm going to comply with his request. 
I wanted to tell you personally before you found out from someone else. 
I don't understand. 
Why are you going along with this? 
Why don't you just tell him that you refuse? 
He has a tape of our conversation. 
The one where we conspire to commit perjury, and he's threatening to use it against me unless I step down. 
Oh, my God. 
Tom Lennox recorded it. 
Bottom line is, I'm not being given a choice here. 
This is all my fault. 
If I hadn't asked you to lie about Karen Hayes, none of this would be happening. 
You were just trying to protect me. 
I could have turned you down, but I didn't. 
Don't blame yourself. 
I'm so sorry. 
I don't know what to say. 
Aw, hell, at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together. 
The president said to take a week, but I want this letter of resignation in his hands by the time he finishes his press conference. 
I am through being the loyal opposition. 
Please, sit. 
First, I want to say that I'm grateful to report that Abu Fayed, the man responsible for these attacks, has been killed, and that all nuclear devices have been recovered. 
I want to take the time to acknowledge the brave men and women in our various law enforcement agencies, and let us not forget our armed services. 
All these people have worked so hard to bring this crisis to an end. 
Their dedication, their perseverance is without equal. 
Despite the brutality of these attacks, we did not allow the violence born of extremism to push us to extremes. 
And, as Americans, we can and should take pride and comfort in that fact. 
Let me conclude by asking for your prayers tonight for all those who grieve this day. 
For all those whose lives have been shattered. 
Let us reach out and begin the process of rebuilding. 
Let us reach out and begin the process of national healing. 
Thank you. 
I'll take some of your questions now. 
Yes. Ian. 
Mr. President, how certain 
are you that the crisis is, in fact, over, and that there are no more of these weapons on American soil? 
Well, based on the intelligence that I've seen, I can say with full confidence, Ian, that the worst has passed, and that the individuals responsible for these attacks have been apprehended, or else killed. 
Yes, Andrea. 
Robin, sir. 
Robin, yes. Robin. 
I'm sorry, it's been a, it's been a very long day. Please, go ahead. 
Mr. President, 
there are several thousand Muslim Americans still being held in detention facilities across the country. 
What's going to happen to these people? 
I've already directed Homeland Security to begin dismantling these detention facilities. 
Uh... all detainees 
are to be released once the immediate crisis is passed. 
Excuse me. Um, now 
that the crisis has passed, we will be, um... 
we will be reviewing the situation regarding individuals that we have in custody. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm, not, uh, I'm not being very clear. 
Uh, let me say again regarding your question, Andrea, that... Robin. 
I'm sorry. Robin. 
Let me say again regarding... 
regarding your question that the, uh... 
the detention facilities that, that, that we will, uh... 
uh... that, uh... 
We, we're going t... Ugh! 
Oh, my God. 
Get Medical right away! 
LOWRY: Code 4. Repeat, Code 4. 
We need an emergency medical team to the press room. 
Get these people out of here. 
HOLLISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, we need to clear this room. 
All signs indicate the president has suffered a cerebral hemorrhage brought on by injuries he sustained earlier in the day. 
Meaning he never should have been brought out of the coma. 
However detrimental that decision was to his health, I'm confident that in light of his actions today, he would continue to support it. 
I'm glad you're so confident, Karen, since it was your reckless action that resulted in his stroke. 
DR. WELTON: 
Sir, it's unclear if the stroke was inevitable, but in any event, I'll take full responsibility. 
Excuse me. 
Now is not the time for recriminations, self-imposed or otherwise. 
Doctor, when will we know the extent of the damage and the prospects for recovery? 
After the MRI. 
The president is being prepped for transport to Bethesda as we speak. 
Based on my impressions, the damage was severe. 
I don't think we can expect the president to regain consciousness anytime soon. 
So it is incontestable Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue his duties as commander-in-chief. 
There's no denying that this is a great tragedy for the nation and... for those of us who 
know the president personally. 
Just... take care of him, 
Doctor. 
Of course. 
Excuse me. 
Notify the Senate and the House of the transfer of power and have the sec def and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs authorize me under the 25th Amendment. 
Yes, sir. 
Tom... 
have the press secretary issue a statement. 
President Palmer's been... 
incapacitated. 
No need for alarm. 
Executive authority's been transferred to me. 
Our... 
hopes and prayers are with him. 
All right, sir. 
And I'll also need you available to review everything on the president's agenda. 
All right, sir. 
Actually, there's something on the agenda I think you'll want immediate clarification on. 
What's that? 
Wayne Palmer just issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand classified Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage. 
Can you explain this? 
Yes. That was 
a personal request from Jack Bauer to the president. 
They have a longstanding relationship and as Jack Bauer was largely responsible for recovering the suitcase nukes today, the president wanted to honor his service to this country. 
Karen, I asked you to explain it, not excuse it. 
Understood. 
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese. 
It will only be used to secure the hostage. 
Incidentally, sir, the hostage in question is Audrey Raines, daughter of James Heller. 
Even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome. 
Now, I am happy to honor Agent Bauer's service to this country, but not at the risk of giving classified technology to the Chinese and... 
potentially damaging our relationship with Russia in the process. 
You tell CTU to stop Bauer-- immediately. 
Sir. 
The president expressly... 
That's all for now, Karen. 
You, too, Tom. 
Unbelievable. 
Less than a minute behind his desk and he's already disregarding the president's wishes. 
Nevertheless, we both share Daniel's unease in handing military secrets over to the Chinese. 
I know, Tom, but that is not the point. 
No, here's the point. 
Daniels is now the acting president, whether we like it or not. 
I'm off to the hospital. 
I'll see you there. 
(phone ringing) Buchanan. 
Hi, it's me. 
How's president Palmer? 
Not good. 
The doctor says that he has a cerebral hemorrhage They don't know the extent of the damage, but obviously he's not able to serve. 
Daniels is going to assume the office, and the first wave of his hand, he wants to stop Jack's operation. 
Jack has to return to CTU as soon as possible with the component. 
Does the vice president understand the circumstances under which Wayne Palmer agreed to this? 
No. He's not that 
kind of a man. 
He doesn't operate in shades of gray. 
Does he understand Jack's not gonna give up without a fight? 
You just have to get Jack back to CTU as soon as possible, okay? 
Okay, I'll take care of it. 
Listen up. 
The White House has ordered us to shut down Jack's operation. How far away 
are support teams? 
Six miles. 
Have them standing by, ready to move in, Contact CHP. Have them 
set up roadblocks. 
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this operation. 
Why? 
You've shown me I can't trust you. 
Morris, you cover comm. 
Jack's not gonna go along with this. 
I know. 
(phone rings) Doyle. 
Mike, it's Bill. 
Can Jack hear you? 
Say yes or no. 
Yes. 
There's been a change in profile. 
Noah Daniels is acting President. 
He wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU immediately. 
Understood. 
What's your current location? 
We're about two miles east of the 180 interchange. 
Okay, I need you to exit at the 70, make the first left. 
We'll have roadblocks set up with a backup team ready to take Jack into custody and recover the component. 
All right, we'll do that. 
You need to disarm Jack as soon as quickly and quietly as possible before he finds out. 
No problem. 
(sighs) CTU's got a report from Cal Trans. 
The 180's closed due to high winds. 
They're concerned about possible fallout. 
They want us to take 70 instead. 
Fine. 
Don't you move. 
Jack, what's the problem? 
Earlier today, I shot my old partner, a friend of mine, because he tried to stop me from doing what I have to do. 
Don't think for a second I won't do that to you. 
Slowly I want you to pull over. 
Now. 
Take the keys out of the ignition. 
Put them on the center console. And your phone. 
Jack, you don't want to do this. 
Slowly get out of the truck. 
Back up towards the fence. 
Jack, listen to me. 
Daniels is the acting president. 
He's the one who called this off. 
Shut up and grab the fence! 
This is gonna end badly, Jack. 
You can't go against the White House! 
Jack! 
Jack!

=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents We-We're going t... 
(grunts) HAYES: Get Medical right away! 
LISA: It is incontestable Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue his duties as commander-in-chief. 
I have the fate of the western world and the lives of millions of Americans hanging in the balance, and I can't... 
stop thinking about you. 
Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody... 
and he let him go. 
Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland. 
Someone is going to have to go down the farther from the president, the better. 
Are you asking me to resign? 
HAYES: No, Bill. 
I have to fire you. 
You should work with Milo, you know, get cozy. 
Don't be such a jealous jerk. 
Um, the day I'm jealous is the day I kill myself. 
Is there anything else? 
How about don't arm nuclear bombs for terrorists. 
Sorry. 
That's not how I feel. 
Yeah, it is. 
No, it's not-- it just slipped out of my mouth. 
Morris! 
You shouldn't have any trouble running CTU. 
I'm not the right choice to take over. 
You are the right choice. 
Nothing will change operationally. 
Your objective remains the same: bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over the component to the Chinese. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Let's do this. 
Audrey walks out of here alone. 
As soon as I see that she gets down near the bridge, then I'll give you the component. 
DOYLE: All right, this is going down now, Nadia. 
Jack is about to hand over the component. 
NADIA: Mike, don't let that happen. 
MAN: Cheng and his men have escaped from the hotel. 
They're in three black Hummers, heading north. 
Agent Bauer, get down! 
Weapon is down! 
Down on the ground now! 
Who is your commanding officer? 
DOYLE: I am, Jack. 
I got to take you into custody. 
Where's the sub-circuit board? 
Cheng's got it. 
I was set to blow the building and destroy the component until you engaged us in a firefight. 
I had this handled. 
Audrey, it's over. 
It's all right, you're safe. 
Help me, Jack. 
Please don't let them do this to me. 
Audrey! 
They've done something to her. 
You've got to help her, please. 
(inaudible) My God. 
(helicopter propeller whirring) Mr. Bauer, was this 
the only C-4 that was in the building? 
Yes, that's everything; the building's clean. 
(sniffles) Ms. Raines, 
my name is Mike Doyle. 
I'm a CTU field agent. 
We're hoping you saw or heard something while Cheng was holding you... 
something that could lead us to him. 
You're safe now, Ms. Raines. 
Jack bought your freedom from the Chinese with a component that contains highly sensitive Russian technology. 
Can you understand me, Ms. Raines? 
Help me, Jack. 
Please don't let them do this to me. 
I want CHP to work with military on roadblocks. 
You need to set up three and five-mile perimeters from Cheng's last confirmed location. 
I need satellite scans analyzed and forwarded to me now. 
(over phone): The system's overloaded. 
Yeah, I understand the system's overloaded. 
Those are your orders. 
(knock at door) You wanted to see me? 
Yeah. Morris, 
I read your request for a transfer out of Comm. 
Mm-hmm. 
Is this because you and Chloe had a fight? 
Look, your facts are essentially correct. 
The why I don't see as being anybody's business. 
Look, Morris, you've had a hard day we all have but... I really need you 
on the floor. 
So I'm sorry; your request for a transfer is denied. 
(conversing indistinctly) You're new to the job, and I'm just trying to protect you from being caught in the middle of a very awkward professional situation. 
You're asking me to indulge your private melodrama while we're in the middle of an international crisis. 
Bill Buchanan said he'd consider my request. 
Did he tell you that? 
Bill Buchanan is not running CTU, I am. 
I've made my decision. 
Nadia... 
Go back to your station, keep your personal life to yourself. 
You can deal with this tomorrow. 
Nadia... 
We're done here, Morris. 
(phone rings) Anything else you want to say? 
Oh, yeah. 
This is Nadia Yassir. 
Nadia, it's Mike. 
Do you have a lead on Cheng? 
We're working on it. 
How did it go with Audrey Raines? 
Not good. 
What, she doesn't know anything about Cheng? 
Where he was holding her, what he was doing? 
She's completely nonresponsive. 
I'm not a shrink, but whatever they did to her in China... 
it left her with some kind of post-traumatic reaction. 
Bring her back here. 
District will want a specialist to take a look at her. 
Do you have any idea what Jack was thinking? 
Yeah. He had this 
motel rigged with C-4. 
He was going to take this whole place down as soon as Audrey was safe. 
He was willing to sacrifice his life to get Audrey released? 
And his plan would've worked if I hadn't intervened. 
You saved his life. 
But I lost the component. 
Jack went against a direct order from the White House. 
This was no one's fault but his. 
We're on our way back. 
Stevenson, you take Ms. Raines. 
I'll go with Bauer. 
(helicopter propeller whirring nearby) Audrey! 
Audrey! 
Audrey! 
DOYLE: Jack, stop. 
Where are you taking her? 
To CTU, Jack, the same place you're going. 
Let me talk to her, just for a couple of minutes, please. 
You saw what condition she's in, Jack. 
I know her. 
I know what she's been through. 
I might be the only person that can get through to her. 
Please. 
You're under arrest, Jack. 
We'll discuss this back at CTU. 
Put him in the second chopper. 
Mike! Let me talk to her now. 
HAYES: CTU is pouring all their resources into finding Cheng, and this executive order gives them authority to close all ports and border crossings. 
We can't keep migrant workers from crossing our borders at will. 
How the hell are we supposed to stop a determined enemy agent? 
Well, I think the point is to slow him down, sir, so that CTU has more time to find him, but I agree, Cheng will find a way to smuggle out the Russian component eventually. 
So then Russia loses its defensive edge against the Chinese and Moscow blames us. 
We will do everything in our power to prevent that, sir. 
(sighs) (slams book) Thank you. 
Karen... 
Yes. 
Tom told me about you and Bill, how you had to... 
fire him from CTU. 
How did he take it? 
Not well. 
Karen. 
Yes. 
You and I have had our... 
difficulties in the past, but I want you to know that... 
I value your role here and that I appreciate your sacrifice. 
Thank you. 
(knock at door) Excuse me, sir. 
What is it, Tom? 
Russian President's calling for you in the telepresence suite. 
He insisting on a face-to-face, Did he say what he wants? 
No, but he's on with the heads of military and intelligence services. 
I want both of you with me on this. 
(gasps) Palmer's still in a coma. 
Looks like Noah's going to be acting president for some time. 
Good for Noah. 
And good for us. 
The only thing he cares about is pushing his lunatic foreign agenda. 
Any pending legislation on spending... 
you'll defer to me. 
Now that he is acting president, we're going to have to be even more careful We will be. 
I've got half an hour. 
Let's stop talking. 
President Suvarov, you're on a secure conference with Vice President Daniels. 
President Suvarov. 
Mr. Vice President. 
You know my Chief of Staff, Tom Lennox, and Karen Hayes, my National Security Advisor. 
How can we help you? 
Some very troubling news has been brought to my attention. 
What would that be? 
The nuclear weapons that fell into terrorists' hands contained proprietary Russian technology that up until now has only been available to your government and mine. 
I'm well aware of that, sir. 
Then you are also "well aware" that an FB-sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government. 
Do you deny that, sir? 
Mr. President, 
all I'm prepared to tell you is that... 
we're in control of the situation. 
Mr. Vice President, 
my generals have confirmed that this component contains information that will compromise our defensive capabilities. 
You must stop the Chinese from leaving your country with it. 
I don't appreciate being dictated to, Mr. President. 
Now, I don't need to remind you that it was a Russian general who allowed those bombs to enter the U.S. 
in the first place, the same Russian general who conspired to detonate them. 
That does not change our grave concerns about this development. 
If you do not intercept this component, my generals have instructions to initiate an appropriate response. 
Mr. President... 
Good night, sir. 
How the hell did the Russians find out about this?! 
Russian intelligence must have been tracking it. 
No, no, no, the information circle is too tight. 
Only select people at the White House and CTU even knew about this. 
So you're saying there's a spy? 
There is no other explanation. 
I will start an immediate internal investigation into the White House staff. 
I'll do the same at CTU, sir. 
What are your reads on Suvarov? 
How seriously do we take his threat? 
Oh, I would say very, sir. 
With the Chinese in possession of the component, the Russians will need to extend their defensive line in Central Asia. 
We have a military base in the region. 
Which the Russians will have to target. 
We will have to respond in kind... 
Which will escalate things beyond just a regional conflict. 
Give CTU whatever they need to find this man Cheng. 
(speaking Chinese) (speaking Chinese) OPERATIVE: Yes? 
I've interfaced the component. 
You should have the schematics. 
Yes, they've downloaded. 
I'm running a diagnostic on the component now. 
Good. We'll be there 
in less than an hour. 
Wait. 
(typing) (sighs): There's a problem. 
What? 
The circuit board is damaged. 
Can you fix it? 
No, not unless I have The security override. 
We don't have access to that information. 
Without it, this technology's useless to us! 
We'll have to find someone who has the necessary expertise. 
LITTLE I'm gonna take a quick shower. 
Noah's waiting for me to get back. 
(shower running) * * (cell phone ringing) Yes? 
We're all set. 
And the girl doesn't know you're working for us? 
Not a clue. 
Good. 
Morris. 
Yeah? 
I saw you arguing with Nadia. 
Yeah. 
Was it about us? 
I asked for a transfer. 
It was denied. 
Why did you do that? 
Because working with you is becoming very uncomfortable. 
I told you I was sorry. 
You said I should stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs. 
We've both said things that we haven't mean before. 
Yeah, I know. 
But... 
there's a line, darling, and... 
and you crossed it. 
So what are you saying? 
I'm saying that... 
it's over. 
There's no going back. 
We're done. 
Morris. 
Look at me. 
You don't have to do this. 
We're done. 
But, Morris... 
(sniffles) (sobbing quietly) Nadia, the situation has escalated with the Russians. 
They know the Chinese have the component, and they're threatening military action unless we stop them from taking it out of the country. 
How did the Russians find out? 
A leak. 
Tom Lennox is looking into it here, and he wants you to start an investigation there. 
I'll let Internal Affairs know right away. 
Now, what about Audrey Raines? 
Has she provided any information that will lead us to Cheng? 
Not yet, but the psychiatric specialist from District has just arrived. 
So we're hoping he can get her to talk. 
Do you have any other leads? 
Not at the moment. 
That's unfortunate. 
I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that we stop Cheng. 
If you need more resources, you need to let me know now. 
Do you understand? 
I will. 
One more thing. 
To be honest, Karen, what we need is Bill Buchanan. 
But there's a rumor flying around you fired him. 
Well, that's complicated, Nadia. 
Not as far as we're concerned. 
You know more than anyone how good he is at this job. 
I don't see how something like this could happen when we're in the middle of a crisis. 
Look, I'm not at liberty to discuss this. 
Just keep me updated with your progress on finding Cheng. 
Dr. Bradley. I'm Nadia Yassir, 
acting head of CTU. 
We're under a time crunch now, so I'd like to get started with Ms. Raines 
immediately. 
She's being prepped in medical. 
These men can take you there. 
I'll join you shortly. 
Thank you. 
I want to hear your first impressions as soon as possible. 
Of course. 
Nadia, Doyle and Jack just landed. 
Okay, have Doyle secure Bauer, and then have him meet me in medical. 
Okay. 
Can you leave us alone, please? 
Thank you. 
Ms. Raines. 
Ms. Raines, I'm Dr. Bradley. 
I'm here to perform a medical evaluation to help you remember whatever you can about this man Cheng where you were held, what you heard. 
It's all right. 
It's okay. 
Come here. Look at this. 
Please, you've got to let me talk to her. 
You know CTU's protocol. 
You know how they're gonna interrogate her. 
They're gonna make her retreat farther inside herself. 
Please, listen to me! 
Sit down. 
This will make it more comfortable. 
Mike. 
Please, I'm begging you. 
Take care of her. 
Jack's in holding three. 
How you doing? 
White House is pressuring us to find Cheng. 
We have to hope he can get some information out of her. 
(knocking) Dr. Bradley, 
this is Agent Doyle. 
He was involved in rescuing Ms. Raines. 
Do you have a diagnosis? 
My preliminary is she's a type three catatonic, capable of following simple commands and repeating words and basic phrases, but otherwise, utterly unresponsive. 
Do you think that you'll be able to get the information we need from her? 
Within your timeframe? 
Not without intervention. 
What does that mean? 
Ms. Raines is suffering from 
severe psychological abuse, amplified by pharmacological agents, as evidenced by more than 100 injection sites on her arms, feet and groin. 
It's gonna be next to impossible to communicate with her in the near term unless we essentially attempt to shock her out of this state. 
So they used drugs to torture her, and you're gonna give her more? 
These are different compounds, sir, used for different reasons. 
What are the risks? 
22 percent of patients experience cardiovascular events, some of it neurological. 
In the most extreme cases, death can occur. 
We can't do this. 
No, Doyle. 
I am not comfortable with the high percentage of adverse reactions either. 
But this treatment is the only way you're gonna get anything out of her in the time you have. 
Maybe not. One of our agents, 
Jack Bauer, has a long history with her, and the Chinese put him through something similar. 
Listen, it makes sense to see what Jack can draw from her before we do anything riskier. 
Doctor? 
Yeah, I know who Jack Bauer is. 
I read Ms. Raines' file 
on the way over. 
And in my opinion, contact with him will more likely upset her than encourage her to talk. 
But there's no chance of her dying from it. 
Let's give Jack a chance with her. 
With all due respect, it's not your call, Ms. Yassir. 
District has formally placed Ms. Raines in my custody 
and granted me the authority to determine appropriate treatment. 
I'm gonna begin preparing for her treatment shortly. 
I'll let you know what the results are. 
Good day. 
You can't let him do this, not without even giving Jack a... 
He has jurisdiction. 
The hell with jurisdiction! 
There's nothing I can do. 
You can do what you know is right. 
That's what Buchanan would have done. 
And that was uncalled for. 
Well, I'm sorry. 
What I meant to say is, since you're acting director, you can't be afraid to step on toes. 
Does that go down better? 
And part of being acting director is respecting the chain of command. 
But thank you for your advice. 
It's him. 
(ringing continues) Hi. 
Where are you? 
I'm... on my way out the door. 
Well, get here as quickly as you can. 
There's a crisis. 
Has there been another threat? 
Yes, but not from the terrorists. 
I'll fill you in when you get here. 
I'll be there in less than 15. 
Lisa... 
I need you. 
I need you, too. 
I have to go. 
What's going on? 
I don't know. 
Yes. 
It's me. 
What's my next move? 
Thank you. 
Yes. 
I think I've identified the leak, sir. 
Is it here or at CTU? 
Oh, it's very much here, sir. 
I had NSA run a data sort on all White House phone calls and e-mails over the last two and half hours. 
That's when we found out the sub-circuit board was in play. 
And? 
During the same time frame, one of our staffers called a lobbyist, Mark Bishop, three times. 
Now, CIA had flagged this Bishop two years ago as having "possible to likely contact with Russian Intelligee agents." 
No further investigation was done due to lack of resources. 
Which staffer are we talking about here, Tom? 
Lisa Miller, sir. 
(scoffs) I find it hard to believe my Chief Aide is working for the Russians. 
I don't think she did so knowingly, sir. 
She wouldn't have called Bishop from her phone. 
Then I... I don't understand 
how is this man getting information from her? 
Well, so far... 
we have found credit card records that show Ms. Miller and Bishop 
staying at the same hotels, on the same nights, several times over the past year. 
Now, I think if we dig a little deeper, I'm sure that we will find more evidence that shows these two were sleeping together. 
Then we have a bigger problem than you think, Tom. 
Why is that, sir? 
Because I'm sleeping with her, too. 
She... 
She started working for me two years after my wife... 
After Nancy died, it... 
At that time I didn't think I'd ever feel anything for another woman again, but... 
Lisa and I became close, then last year... 
we were working late one night, and... 
Well, you understand how these things happen, Tom. 
Damn it. 
What a fool I've been. 
What the hell do I do, Tom? 
You know, actually, sir, handled correctly, we may be able to turn this situation to our advantage. 
Mike, what's happening out there? 
Will they let me speak to Audrey? 
I tried to make it happen, Jack, but they're not going for it. 
Why not? 
'Cause the shrink who's treating her he doesn't think it's a good idea. 
Let me talk to him. 
I wish this guy was interested in what other people had to say, but he isn't. 
Why? 
He's got her in medical, Jack, and he's about to try some protocol of his own using big doses of drugs. 
It could kill her, Jack. 
Why did you uncuff me? 
'Cause I think you need to do something about it. 
Make it look good. 
Easy. 
(grunts) (grunts) Vitals are strong. 
I think she's ready. 
Good. 
Get her IV started. 
Excuse me, sir, you can't be in here. 
Have you started yet? 
No. 
What have you done to her?! 
Nothing. Nothing. 
Consider yourself lucky. 
You're Jack Bauer, I recognize you from her file. 
You shouldn't be here. 
Seeing you will only make things worse. 
Shut up! 
(breathing heavily) Audrey, I need you to come with me. 
I need you to come with me now. 
Please, come on. 
(alarm blaring) Just get me anything you can. 
(blaring continues) Milo, what's the location of that alarm? 
Clinic, Nadia, exam room six, where Audrey's being treated. 
Get me video feed. 
She's gone. 
Lock everything down. 
Get me holding room three! 
If we just let Jack talk to Audrey, none of this would have happened. 
Okay, thank you. 
Security's confirmed that jack didn't pass through any of the exits before the lockdown. 
He's still here somewhere. 
No one left sectors A through K they're clear. 
All right, so he's got to be on the lower levels. 
Have you checked those video feeds? 
Yes. 
That's what I'm doing, just takes a little bit of time. 
I know, make it take less time. 
Where's Chloe? 
Morris? 
I don't... I'm not sure. 
Doyle. 
Have you found Jack? 
No, not yet. 
But I'd like to know how he managed to overpower you? 
I made a mistake, I got too close. 
Yeah, see, I don't think it was a mistake. 
You made it very clear that you wanted Jack to have a chance with Audrey. 
So, I think you went there with the express purpose of letting him overpower you and then escaping with your keycard. 
I did what I think is best for this operation and for Audrey Raines. 
I have him! 
He's headed down to the lower level. 
But with everything locked down he's only going to have access to corridors L and M. 
Okay, I'm on my way. 
Let me know if you find anything else. 
And have Dr. Bradley 
and Doyle meet me there. 
Hold on. 
Come on. 
(beeping) (grunting) It's all right. 
It's all right, I'm here. 
I'm here. 
I'm not going anywhere. 
I'm going to protect you. 
I'm going to take care of you. 
I promise. 
I know you can recognize me. 
I see it in your eyes. 
It's me, Jack. 
The men who hurt you, they can't touch you now. 
I won't allow it. 
Right now, I need you to try and remember. 
I need you to remember who you are. 
Your name is Audrey Raines. 
You were born Audrey Louise Heller in Albany, New York. 
Your father was the Secretary of Defense, James Heller. 
Your mother's name was Alicia. 
She died when you were nine. 
Please, Audrey, just try and remember. 
(computer beeps) Nadia, I've got Jack. 
Room 237 was just sealed from the inside. 
They have to be in there. 
I see the room now. 
Damn it. It's disabled. 
Get an entry team down here now. 
Need an entry team at door 237. 
The men that were holding you, when they called me there were within an hour of my motel. 
When they moved you, can you remember if, if you took surface streets or the freeway, anything that can help us find them? 
I want them to pay for what they've done. 
I know what you've been through. 
I know what it's like to feel like it's never going to end... 
to hate them that much, and then need them... 
to start blaming yourself for everything that's happening to you. 
But they can't hurt you anymore. 
You don't need to hide now. 
It's over. 
Please, Audrey, give me some kind of a signal. 
Anything, anything that let's me know you understand what I'm saying, please. 
Please! 
It's all right, I'm... 
I'm sorry. 
It's all right. 
I know you're trying. 
I love you with all my heart. 
(sizzling) I'm not going to let them hurt you, but they're going to take you away from me for a little while. 
There's nothing I can do to stop that. 
Audrey, we're out of time. 
Is there anything that you can tell me that could help us find Cheng or at least where they were holding you? 
Please. 
Come here. 
Come on. 
Get down. 
Jack, put your gun down. 
You put your gun down! 
Get him out of here. 
I'm not letting him take Audrey back to medical. 
Jack, you need to lower your weapon. 
Not until I get a guarantee from you that Audrey is safe! 
(quietly): Bloomfield. 
What'd you say? 
Bloomfield. 
JACK: Did you hear that? 
She said "Bloomfield." 
I asked her where she was being held; she's trying to answer. 
We don't know if that represents genuine communication. 
"Bloomfield" could be another programmed response meaning nothing. 
We'll soon find out. 
Morris, did you get that? 
Bloomfield: have Chloe track it down, keep Doyle in the loop. 
MORRIS: All right. 
In the meantime, Dr. Bradley, 
I'd like you to wait for me in my office. 
I'm not going anywhere; she's my patient. 
And she's my witness. 
I suggest you go with these men, Doctor. 
Listen to me, Jack. 
You have my word, I will not let him touch her. 
Please, lower your weapon. 
Audrey, please, it's all right. 
He's going to take care of you. 
Jack, I need you to go with these men to Holding. 
Yes, of course, General. 
I'll review the report with the Vice President. 
I'll get right back to you. 
Suvarov wasn't bluffing. 
No, sir. 
Air Force satellites confirm the Russian Army is moving large numbers of troops into the Central Asian theater. 
How long before they're in range of our base? 
They'll be within strike range within the hour, sir. 
(door opens) I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President, 
I got back here as soon as I could. 
Forward General Wilkes' report to the Joint Chiefs. 
Let me know their recommendations. 
Yes, sir. 
(door closes) What's going on? 
Why is Tom talking to the Joint Chiefs? 
Because the Russians know the Chinese have the component. 
How did that happen? 
Someone inside the Beltway has been selling them information. 
Someone with access. 
A man named Mark Bishop. 
Do you know him? 
I believe he's a lobbyist. 
Are you sure it's Bishop? 
Yes. 
We began monitoring his phone calls as soon as this came to our attention. 
Ten minutes ago, he called a known Russian Intelligence agent from his cell phone. 
BISHOP (over recorder): It's me. 
What's my next move? 
MAN: It's imperative you reach out to her over the next few hours. 
Find out if there are any developments with the component. 
BISHOP: I'll call her and I'll access her PDA again, see if she has any new e-mail. 
MAN: Very good. 
So how well do you know this man Bishop? 
He's an acquaintance. 
He consulted on a white paper last year on defense spending. 
Damn it, Lisa, don't insult me any more than you already have. 
Bishop's been passing intelligence to the Russians that he got from you. 
I don't know if he read your e-mails or if you talked about it in bed, but the Russians know about the component and they're threatening military action against us if we don't get it back from the Chinese. 
I always knew you were a good liar. 
I just... I just didn't 
think you could lie to me. 
I guess I thought too highly of myself. 
I swear to you, I didn't know. 
It's still treason, which I don't need to remind you is a capital offense. 
You didn't just betray me, you betrayed your country. 
What do you want from me? 
You're going to go back to your boyfriend and you're going to make him believe that we have the component back. 
I can't do that. 
You can and you will do exactly what Tom Lennox tells you to do. 
And don't you even think about trying to expose our... 
relationship. 
If you go there, I'll have you declared an enemy combatant. 
Put you in solitary; it'll be years before you speak to anyone about anything. 
Noah... 
Are you all right, sir? 
I'm better now. 
Secret Service is sending over a team to work with her. 
We'll get this going soon. 
I've made arrangements to take you away from here. 
I'm going to look after you, Audie, I promise. 
You will get well and you won't be alone. 
I'll be right back, sweetheart. 
Before I take my daughter, I'd like to see Jack Bauer. 
Where is he? 
He's in Holding, sir. 
Escort Mr. Heller to Holding. 
Nadia, hey, did Audrey speak when he was with her? 
No, I don't think so. 
Well, it turns out the name she gave us might be a good lead. 
There's a Bloomfield Copper Company that used to have a refining facility in Jefferson Heights. 
Forensics just found oxidized copper particles on her clothing. 
You think that's where Cheng was holding her? 
Yeah, I think it might be his base of operations. 
LAPD's locking down the building, but I told them to stand down till I get there. 
Good work, Mike. 
Thanks. 
Mike. 
You were right. 
I should have stood up to Dr. Bradley. 
You did. 
When it counted, you stood up to him. 
Mr. Secretary. 
You've seen Audrey. 
I made Audrey a promise, I make the same promise to you. 
I will take care of her as long as it takes. 
I will be there for her. 
No, you won't, Jack. 
Excuse me? 
I don't want you to go anywhere near my daughter ever again. 
Audrey went looking for you and this is how she came back. 
What's happened to her is your fault. 
I accept that responsibility, but I can help her. 
Stay away from her. 
Mr. Secretary, earlier 
I got through to Audrey. 
I can do the same thing again. 
I just need some time. 
Please. 
I'm warning you. 
Stay away. 
You're cursed, Jack. 
Everything you touch, one way or another, ends up dead. 
Marilyn. 
Jack, what happened? 
My father escaped. 
I don't know where he is. 
He might be in the area. 
I want you both to go back to CTU. 
Josh, I know that there's a lot to explain, and I promise you when this is over, you and I are going to sit down and I will talk you through what happened. 
Thank you for saving my son. 
He reminds me of you. 
I told you I was sorry. 
MORRIS: You said I should stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs. 
We're done. 
I've interfaced the component. 
There's a problem. 
The circuit board is damaged. 
Can you fix it? 
No, not unless I have the security override. 
We don't have access to that information. 
We'll have to find someone who has the necessary expertise. 
An FB sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government. 
If you do not intercept this component, my generals have instructions to initiate an appropriate response. 
How the hell did the Russians find out about this? 
Only select people at the White House even knew about this. 
So you're saying there's a spy? 
Which staff are we talking about here, Tom? 
LENNOX: Lisa Miller, sir. 
DANIELS: Bishop's been passing intelligence to the Russians that he got from you. 
I swear to you, I didn't know. 
It's still treason. 
You're going to go back to your boyfriend and you're going to make him believe that we have the component back. 
White House is pressuring us to find Cheng. 
We have to hope we can get some information out of her. 
DOCTOR: It's going to be next to impossible to communicate with her in the near term unless we essentially attempt to shock her out of this state. 
Mike... 
will they let me speak to Audrey? 
DOYLE: The shrink who's treating her doesn't think it's a good idea. 
And he's about to try some protocol of his own using big doses of drugs. 
It could kill her, Jack. 
Why did you uncuff me? 
'Cause I think you need to do something about it. 
Is there anything that you can tell me that can help us find Cheng or at least where they were holding you? 
Please! 
DOYLE: Jack, put down your gun. 
Not until I get a guarantee from you that Audrey is safe. 
Bloomfield. 
What'd you say? 
Bloomfield. 
Morris, did you get that? 
"Bloomfield." 
Have Chloe track it down, keep Doyle in the loop. 
Earlier, I got through to Audrey. 
I can do the same thing again, I just need some time. 
Please. 
Stay away from my daughter. 
Everything you touch, orerJack. 
. 
(cell door closes) I thought you should know, James Heller just left with his daughter. 
He also reiterated to me his demand that you're to stay away from her. 
He'll be filing a restraining order to that effect. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
The name that Audrey gave us when I was talking to her Bloomfield-- did it pan out? 
It did. 
It's an old copper refining facility in Jefferson Heights. 
We found oxidized copper particles on Audrey's clothing, so we're pretty sure that's where Cheng was holding her. 
Now, if that's his base of operations, he should have the Russian component there, so we're locking it down and dispatching teams now. 
You need to let me go with them. 
You're still under arrest, Jack. 
For 20 months in a Chinese prison, Cheng tried to break me. 
I know him. 
I know how he thinks. 
I am your best chance at stopping him. 
You willfully disobeyed a presidential order. 
Your actions resulted in Cheng getting ahold of that component. 
That's why I'm begging you to let me go. 
I caused this mess; let me clean it up. 
Please. 
Damn it, Nadia, you have the authority to let me do this. 
This isn't about finding that component for you, Jack. 
This is about getting revenge against Cheng. 
Cheng is responsible for Audrey's condition. 
You're damn right this is about revenge. 
I want Cheng more than anything in the world. 
But I gave President Palmer my word that I would destroy that component before I let it fall into enemy hands. 
Please... 
give me a chance to keep my word. 
I'm sorry, Jack, I can't. 
Don't even think about it, Jack. 
If you make a move, I will have you put in restraints. 
Maybe I could help from here. 
I could run tactical. 
Division is sending over a ranking section chief to replace me. 
I promise you I will take it up with him when he gets here. 
Okay, thanks. 
MORRIS: We have a land sat image of Bloomfield. 
It's a big place. 
There's Cheng's Hummer at the rear entrance. 
All right, port it over to tactical for analysis. 
It's already happening. 
Status update on LAPD? 
All reserve units are on the way. 
They should have a perimeter in 20 minutes. 
You okay? 
Fine. 
You don't look fine. 
Since you're so keen to know, Chloe and I have split up. 
Shut up, Morris. 
Pointless being coy about it, right? 
We're still doing our jobs; we're all professionals. 
It's just that if I were you, I'd stay out of it. 
I will. 
WOMAN: These are the transcripts from Marilyn Bauer's statement. 
She needs to review them. 
I'll take care of it. 
Wheels are rolling in five minutes. 
All right, gentlemen, listen up. 
Your objective is the Bloomfield Copper facility in Jefferson Heights. 
We have good reason to believe this is Cheng's safehouse and that he has the component in his possession. 
LAPD is setting up a five-block perimeter. 
Your job is to penetrate the facility, apprehend Cheng, and secure the component. 
If Cheng gets out of the country with that component, Russia will hold us responsible for providing the Chinese access to their defense codes. 
And they'll strike back at us. 
We need to recover that component. 
There is no room for error. 
Real-time tactical feeds and satellite recon will be uplinked to your PDAs. 
Any questions? 
Good luck. 
You're doing a good job. 
I'm just trying to keep the roof from caving in until my replacement gets here. 
Listen, we're putting every available agent out in the field. 
If Cheng is in that facility, we're going to get him and the component. 
Be careful. 
(speaks Chinese) You have the data. 
It's about time. 
We have to finalize our attack plan. 
I want to attack the target in 15 minutes. 
We'll be ready. 
(speaks Chinese) ##Josh... 
you got to stop watching this and try and get some sleep. 
They're saying that 12,000 people are dead. 
All because of what Dad did. 
Honey, it's not that simple. 
Terrorists were responsible... 
But he was involved. 
He let it happen. 
I wish I was never even born. 
Don't say that. 
Why? That's how I feel. 
I wish I was never part of this sick family. 
You listen to me. 
Listen to me. 
You are not your father. 
You are not responsible for anything he did. 
Come here. 
I love you. 
I do. 
We're gonna be okay. 
I promise you we'll get through this. 
We've been here for hours. 
I want to go home. 
I know, we'll go home in the morning. 
Right now... 
I want you to close your eyes and get some sleep. 
Okay? Come on, lay down. 
CHLOE: Sorry to interrupt. 
It's okay. 
This is a transcript of your statement. 
I need you to review it and make sure it's accurate. 
All right. 
Mrs. Bauer? 
Please call me Marilyn. 
I know you and Jack are close. 
There's something that you need to know. 
What is it? 
It's about Audrey Raines. 
She's still alive. 
What? 
(phone rings, vibrates) Hello. 
It's me. 
Hey, you. 
Thought I wouldn't hear from you again till morning. 
Sorry I left so suddenly. 
We had a crisis with the Russians. 
What kind of crisis? 
It doesn't matter anymore, it's been averted. 
That's good. 
Anyway, I was thinking maybe we could pick up where we left off if you want. 
Well, you know I do, sweetheart, but, um... 
isn't Daniels going to want you to stick around so he can paw you every chance he gets? 
I'm the last thing on his mind right now. 
Well, his loss. 
How soon can you get here? 
I'm on my way. 
I love you. 
I love you, too. 
I'll see you soon. 
All right. 
Sounded, uh... 
genuine enough. 
Now, when you go back to Mr. Bishop, you will find 
a way to excuse yourself from the room to allow him time to access your PDA. 
We've uploaded memos stating that a Chinese agent was trying to smuggle a piece of Russian technology out of the country, and was taken out in a military strike. 
Do you understand? 
You want the Russians to think the component was destroyed in the attack? 
That's correct. 
It's up to you now. 
If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop, he will relay it to his Russian contact, and with any luck at all, President Suvarov will call off his threat of military action against us, at least for the time being. 
I'm sorry, I just don't know... 
if I can go through with this, if I can be with him again, and act like nothing's wrong. 
(snorts) Oh, I'm sure you'll manage. 
For the last year, you've had no problem lying to me. 
So, at any rate, Agent Hollister and I will be in a van parked across the street from Bishop's. 
We'll be monitoring everything. 
You do as you're told and... 
it should all go smoothly. 
Marilyn. 
What are you doing here? 
You should be with Josh. 
I had to see if you were all right. 
I'm fine. 
I don't think the charges will stand up, given the extenuating circumstances. 
I meant... 
I meant about Audrey. 
I'm so sorry, Jack. 
I feel awful telling you she was dead. 
You didn't know. No one knew. 
Still... 
I heard the Chinese caused her to have some kind of... 
psychological breakdown. 
Is she going to be all right? 
I don't know. 
What do her doctors say? 
It's out of my hands. 
What do you mean, it's out of your hands? 
Her father's Secretary Heller. 
He's already taken her away from here. 
I've been ordered to stay away from her and to stay out of her life. 
How could he do that to you? 
You saved her life. 
Marilyn, please. 
I don't want to talk about this. 
Miss Yassir told us that Josh and I don't need to be in CTU custody anymore. 
They're going to process us out in the morning. 
Good. 
I'd like to bring Josh by to see you before we go. 
That will be fine. 
Jack... whatever happens, 
when all this is over, I want you to know... 
I'll be there for you. 
Thank you. 
Mrs. Bauer? 
Marilyn, you really should go. 
Chloe. 
Any word on Cheng? 
Doyle's leading a team to Bloomfield right now. 
They should be there any second. 
Please, keep me informed. 
Jack, we'll get Cheng and the component. 
(door closes) (sighs) There's the entrance point. 
There's only one. 
Yes, but they will put you in an optimal position for a quick surgical strike. 
Hey, Ryan, take your team around back. 
The rest of you, follow me. 
You know, this isn't going to be bloodless, Cheng. 
People are going to die. 
You do what you need to do. 
Doyle's team's moving into Bloomfield now. 
Remember, your objective isn't to cause casualties. 
Your objective is to obtain the package. 
Nothing else takes precedence. 
I understand. 
* * We'll access the sewer lines from here. 
Once below ground, it's roughly 180 meters to the target. 
All right? 
Let's move. 
Don't let me down. 
Clear! 
Clear. 
Anything? 
No. 
There's nobody here, but you have to see this. 
We have empty rifle magazines, stun grenades, C-4. 
Look, this is an arsenal. 
Yeah. 
Continue with the search. 
See if you can find anything else. 
Yes, sir. 
(dialing) (clears throat) (ringing) O'Brian. 
Chloe, put Nadia on. 
Nadia, it's Doyle. 
Go ahead, Mike. 
Yeah. Cheng's not here. 
Bloomfield's been evacuated. 
If they haven't hit one of our roadblocks, then I'm guessing they got out before we could lock down the perimeter. 
Check the satellite feed. 
Try to back-time the frames before we repositioned. 
And there's something else. 
We found a whole bunch of empty weapon crates. 
What kind of weapons? 
Large-caliber rifles, military-grade C-4, grenades. 
There's enough of an arsenal for a small army. 
Looks like the Chinese are planning to launch a major assault. 
Assault on what? 
We're at the junction. 
Good. Head east 
153 meters. 
That will put you directly beneath CTU and the entrance point. 
##I'm scanning these satellite images from Bloomfield. 
I'm getting a lot of dropped data fields in Sector Eight. 
Chloe. 
I heard you. 
Well, have you any idea what might be causing it? 
'Cause I'm practically blind here. 
You know that patch we downloaded from the USGS subnet? 
Yeah. 
Sometimes it conflicts with the imaging software try deactivating it. 
Thank you, that's what I needed. 
Morris. 
I know you're trying to be professional about everything. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm really having a hard time with what happened between us. 
You have nothing to apologize for, darling. 
You broke up with me because I said something stupid, something I didn't mean. 
About me arming the nukes and being a coward. 
That wasn't stupid. 
It's the God's honest truth. 
I don't believe that. 
Well, it's a fact. 
You were right, whether you want to admit it to yourself or not. 
So you're saying what I think doesn't matter. 
No. I'm saying... 
that I didn't break up with you because of what you said. 
I broke up with you because of what I did. 
No matter how much you think you love me, I know there'll always be that knowledge, and... 
you won't be able to get past it. 
You're wrong. 
You know me better than anyone, right? 
Yeah. 
When am I ever wrong? 
Remember, as soon as you're in, you will create an opportunity for Bishop to access your PDA. 
Something wrong? 
I'm frightened. 
Well, you should be. 
If this thing doesn't work, you will be facing treason charges. 
I've cooperated fully. 
Great, you can testify to that at your trial. 
So... 
get a grip here. 
You will do whatever is necessary to assure Bishop that nothing has changed between the two of you. 
Do you understand? 
Yes. 
All right, let's get the car up here. 
The surveillance camera's all set in the bag, sir. 
It's all yours. 
All right, let's button things up here. 
* * (phone ringing) Yes. 
She's on her way inside, sir. 
Are you sure she can pull this off? 
Let's hope so, sir. 
I appreciate what you're doing, Tom. 
I know this doesn't... 
exactly fall under your job description. 
Well, we're all doing some improvising today, aren't we, sir? 
We both agreed it is in our interest to keep this circle small. 
(sighs) Hey. 
Hi. 
You okay? 
Of course. 
Why? 
You seem, I don't know, tense. 
Mark, come on. 
With everything that's happened, who isn't? 
Right. 
Well, maybe I can loosen you up. 
How's that? Better? 
Yeah. 
You know, um, I'm going to freshen up first. 
Relax. 
We already had a shower, remember? 
I'm really happy you came back. 
The more time I spend away from you the harder it is to let you walk out the door. 
I may have to strap you to the bed. 
permanently. 
Just get out of the room. 
Leave him alone with the PDA. 
I bet you'd like that. 
Mm, immensely. 
You know what? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm just feeling really grungy. 
The situation at the White House has me stressed. 
I'll be right back. 
I thought you said that crisis was averted. 
It was. 
Then you should feel relieved. 
Well... you know me, 
always worried the next crisis is around the corner. 
Mm. I think I know 
how to take your mind off of it. 
Mark... 
##We're here. 
Set the charges. 
Are you ready? 
We're in position. 
The charges are being set. 
Stand by. 
Input the code. 
It worked. We're in. 
Tying us into their security system. 
Overriding their comm. 
We'll go in sectors. 
Two minutes until everything is shut down. 
Nadia, escape vectors from Bloomfield. 
We analyzed every route from the facility. 
There are over 20. 
So whoever was holding Audrey could be anywhere in the city now. 
Morris and Chloe are still back-timing the satellite feed, so hopefully, they'll get a fix on one of the vehicles. 
All right, keep me posted. 
Have we heard anything from Doyle? 
His team's halfway through the forensic sweep and they haven't found anything so far. 
What? 
Never mind. 
Listen, Milo, I saw the look that you gave me when I was talking to Doyle. 
(sighs) I understand if your feelings for me have changed. 
Milo... 
Yes, I, I was hurt, but... 
if there is something going on between you and Doyle, I just... 
I want you to know that it's... 
...it's okay. 
Milo, to be completely honest, I don't know what I feel. 
So much has happened today I haven't had a chance to... 
I haven't had a chance to think through anything. 
I just need some time to sort it all out. 
Nadia... 
Nadia, I've got something. 
What is it? 
This is from about 50 minutes ago. 
I've checked the frames before and after. 
MILO: So they definitely got out of Bloomfield before Doyle's team arrived. 
Notify LAPD. 
Give them a description of the vehicles. 
Chloe, widen the search vector see if we can figure out where those vehicles were headed. 
Charges set. 
Clear out. 
Doyle. 
Doyle? 
CTU to Field Unit Bravo, come in. 
Can't get an outside line. 
Yeah, I can't reach Doyle. 
Comm's down, too. 
Could be a hiccup in the server. 
Check it out. 
Pressman. 
I don't know what the hell is happening. 
I can't access any of the servers. 
The permissions have all been reset. 
(speaks Chinese) Got a visual on the SUV and the van. 
Cheng was heading south on the 110. 
He exited Florence heading east. 
That's six blocks from here. 
That was security. 
They just lost visual surveillance. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
Every one of our security cameras, they all just went out at once. 
Chloe, Code Red emergency lockdown. 
(alarm buzzing) (phone rings) This is Nadia Yasser, Code Red is confirmed. 
Lock this place down! 
Right away. 
Everyone get to your assigned safe rooms now! Go! 
Get moving! 
(machine gun fire) Morris, flood the outer sectors with tear gas. 
I can't. I can't get 
into the system. 
I don't know how they've done it, but we're completely paralyzed. 
Base One, come in! 
Base One, come in! 
Listen to me! 
CTU is under attack! 
You need to open the door now! 
Base One, come in! 
Base One, come in! 
Everyone on the floor! 
I can hear them! 
They're in sector three. 
They're coming this way! 
Now, let me out! 
No one's responding. 
They've cut us off from the main floor. 
We need to get up to the lounge. 
There's civilians there I'm gonna need a weapon. 
Cell phones, throw them in front of you! 
Head count. 
Check the roster. 
Set up the comm unit. 
Filter all communications that comes in here and turn off the alarm. 
(gun cocks) (alarm continues buzzing) (automatic gunfire) (panting) Who's in command? 
Who is in command? 
MILO: I am. 
Milo Pressman. 
I'm Acting Director of CTU. 
Come here! 
##Hello? 
(gasping breaths) The phones are dead. 
Mom, what's going on? 
I don't know. 
(gasps) Josh! Help me push 
this against the door! 
Hurry, Josh! Hurry! 
(Marilyn grunting) MAN: On the floor! Now! 
We found Bauer. 
The boy's with his mother. 
ZHOU: Good. Bring them here. 
On our way. 
All right, get up! 
MARILYN: Leave my son alone! 
Where are you taking us? 
(Marilyn yells) You all right? 
Yes, Jack! What's going on? 
What do they want with Josh? 
What do you mean, Josh? 
They came here to get him. 
Are you sure they came for Josh? 
That's what they said. 
Yes. 
We got to get out of here. 
Come on. 
(Marilyn crying) (whispering): Stay close. Come on. 
(panting) Shut the door. 
(loud clang) Come here. 
Josh, I want you to climb up here and crawl through the air duct. 
Just go. 
I'm not leaving you! 
Josh, you're not leaving anyone behind; we're gonna be following you-- just go through there. Go. 
Keep going. 
MAN: He's out of ammo! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Put your weapon down on the ground. 
Now! 
I'm putting the weapon down! 
I'm putting it down! 
Both of you, get on your knees! 
We have a problem. 
What is it? 
The boy got away. 
He's inside one of the ventilation ducts. 
We have the boy's mother... 
and Jack Bauer. 
Send the woman and Bauer to me-- you wait there. 
(speaks Chinese) Get up. 
Let's go! 
Let's go! 
Cut power to the ventilation system, and tie me in to the public address system. 
I want to talk to the boy directly. 
(sighs) Cheng. 
The boy's escaped. 
We've captured his mother and Jack Bauer. 
Get the boy back. 
I don't care what you have to do! 
Zhou. 
We're getting another call from Agent Doyle. 
I think we need to respond. 
Nadia Yassir! 
Nadia Yassir, stand up! 
Come here. 
According to that roster, you are the ranking officer here. 
Are you? 
Are you the ranking officer? 
Yes. 
One of your men has been calling. 
You need to answer him. 
Tell him you had a problem with your communication system. 
If you try to warn him, I will kill everyone here. 
Starting with you. 
Do you understand me? 
Come on. 
Answer it. 
(beeping) This is Nadia. 
Nadia, it's Mike I've been trying to get ahold of you for a while now. 
Yeah. We had 
a problem with comm. 
What kind of problem? 
Doesn't matter it's sorted out now. 
My team still hasn't picked up any leads on Cheng have you been able to get a visual on him? 
Not yet. 
What is taking so long? 
Nadia, all you had to do was reposition satellite surveillance over Jefferson Heights. 
Mike, we're working as fast as we can, okay? 
What else do you want me to do? 
As soon as we get a visual on Cheng's vehicles, I'll let you know. 
All right, thanks. 
Now go sit back down. 
(Marilyn gasping) Bring her over here. 
What do you want with the boy? 
Who sent you? 
Jack! 
You don't ask the questions here. 
He makes another move, shoot him. 
Activate the P.A. 
(over PA): Josh, I want you to listen to me very carefully. 
I know you're scared, and I don't blame you, but you really don't have to be. 
The truth is, we're not going to hurt you. 
We're going to take you to a safe place-- that's all I can tell you right now. 
Leave him alone! 
Josh! 
I know you heard that, Josh. 
Your mother's here with us. 
She's okay... 
for now. 
I don't want to hurt her, Josh. 
There's been enough bloodshed today. 
Show yourself to one of my men. 
If you do, nothing will happen to your mother. 
If you don't, I'll shoot her. 
She'll die for nothing, Josh, because one way or another, we're going to find you, even if we have to tear this building apart. 
So I'm asking you to save your mother's life. 
I'm going to give you ten seconds. 
If you don't show yourself by the time I finish counting... 
she dies. 
(gasps) One... 
...two... 
...three... 
four... 
five... 
six... 
seven... 
eight... nine... 
(clattering) Wait. 
I can hear him. 
He's coming right now. 
Come on, let's go. 
Let's go, let's go. 
I got him. 
We're coming to you. 
Cheng. 
We have the boy. 
Good work. 
Bring him to me right away. 
Put her with the others. 
(gasps) Mom! 
Josh! 
Sit! 
(panting) The operation was successful. 
My men have your grandson. 
How is he? 
Under stress, a little emotional, but physically unharmed. 
Is his mother alive? 
Yes. So is your son, Jack. 
Good. You have any trouble? 
None to speak of the codes you provided us gave us full access to CTU's security system. 
Have you finished repairing the sub-circuit board? 
Almost. 
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson. 
We will meet at the rendezvous point in 20 minutes. 
It'll be waiting. 
Call me when I can talk to the boy. 
Will do. 
PREVIOUSLY ON 24 As someone who has alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course, I suggest you tread carefully among your people. 
They will come after you. 
I need you to authorize clearance for someone to get inside the bunker. 
Once he's inside, he'll carry the ball. 
You mean, kill the president? 
 We have a cover. 
 A cover? Who? 
Assad. 
Assad? 
You're trying to make it look like he did this? 
This is tom lennox. 
I need to speak to the ranking secret service agent on site. 
carson wondered if you were playing us. 
He said that he didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you! 
Nothing justifies the killing of a president. 
The delivery system software was programmed for five high-priority targets. 
Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three. 
More than enough for our needs, gredenko. 
I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary. 
Do you think the authorities know we're working with fayed? 
If they don't, they will soon. 
Bill, it's jack. 
I've got the correct address for gredenko's safe house. 
Turner's team will be there any minute. 
Clear! 
Clear! 
Mr. 
Buchanan, there's no sign of gredenko or anyone. 
now you talk. 
That was from gredenko. 
You tipped him off. 
Now over half my team is dead! 
It wasn't gredenko on the phone. 
Those aren't his men! 
 Who sent them?! 
 Your father! 
He has my son! 
Take a look out the window. 
The adjacent roof. 
Jack: Dad, it's over! 
There is no empire to protect. 
There's no legacy left. 
I'm the one you want. 
You let josh go, I will surrender. 
You could have had it all. 
What are you waiting for? 
Do it! 
 Who am i talking to? 
 It's charles logan, jack. 
You must have exhausted all your options to find gredenko. 
Come and see me. 
And come alone. 
THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 4:00 P. M. AND 5:00 P. M 
Go ahead. 
We're on our way to the rendezvous. 
Good. 
We've arrived. 
Is the shipment there from nevada? 
No, they are behind schedule. 
But they'll be here any moment. 
How soon can you deploy once we arrive? 
It will take us two hours to assemble the delivery system and run diagnostics, another hour to secure the payload. 
That's longer than I'd hoped. 
Listen, we are working with the best technology. 
It can't be rushed. 
Just remember, without us you'd be delivering your payload in weeks instead of hours. 
I haven't forgotten. 
It seems necessary to remind you now and then. 
I'll be glad when we no longer have to deal with these people. 
They are living in the dark ages. 
And they act like they own the world. 
I'd much rather be fighting them. 
If we succeed today, we'll never have to. 
The arabs and the west, they'll destroy each other. 
The ambassador just arrived, mr. 
President. He's in the waiting area. 
Good. 
Will tom lennox be joining us? 
I spoke to reed pollock. 
He says mr. Lennox is briefing the speaker and minority leader. 
When tom's finished, tell him I want to see him, please. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. Ambassador. 
It's good to see you again, sir. 
Mr. President, 
first allow me to express my country's shock and deep regret over the devastating attack in california. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Of course. 
Any assistance you may require, you need only ask. 
I'm asking you now, sir. 
That's why you're here. 
I believe you know hamri al-assad. 
Mr. Ambassador. 
I have never met mr. Assad in person, 
but I know him by reputation. 
His organization has carried out repeated terrorist actions against my country. 
Your own policies precipitated those actions. 
That's your justification for killing innocent people? 
You and I define innocent in different ways. 
My own deputy lost his seven-year-old son in one of your bombings. 
That is how I define innocent. 
We are not here to air past differences. 
Then why are we here, mr. President? 
At our last meeting, I informed you that we were in contact with assad. 
You told me it was a positive step toward peace. 
And I meant it at that time, but I must confess, after the last attack, I didn't expect to see you in the same room with him. 
And I'm not so sure I care to remain here either. 
It is no more pleasant for me, your excellency. 
Would you give us a moment? 
Certainly. 
Assad is here because of the attack. 
To be frank, sir, we have three more nuclear weapons loose in my country in the hands of terrorists. 
We didn't know that. 
In less than one hour assad is going to go on national television and issue a statement. 
It will be a global appeal to extremists. 
Now, he's going to urge them to put down their arms and engage in peaceful netiation with the west. 
and engage in peaceful netiation with the west. 
Now, we are hoping to compel someone to come forward with any information regarding those nuclear weapons. 
A petition like this coming from assad? 
 It could have a profound effect. 
 We're counting on that. 
What do you need from us? 
I want a public statement of support from your prime minister. 
And I want it to follow right on the heels of assad'S. 
Mr. Assad is a polarizing figure in my country. 
A public endorsement of him could have grave political consequences for the prime minister. 
Then you tell your prime minister that we have a carrier group operating less than 25 miles off his shores. 
My advisors are pressing me hard for a military response, so if we are attacked again, I won't be able to hold them off. 
This is sounding like an ultimatum, mr. 
President. 
It's not an ultimatum, mr. Ambassador. 
I'm merely pointing out the fact that neither the prime minister nor I have the luxury of worrying about political consequences on a day like today. 
I am putting my presidency on the line, so please, stop handing me excuses. 
Get on the phone and make this happen. 
Nadia, what's the status? 
Turner's team just completed their second sweep of the house. But the results were negative. 
If gredenko was using this address, he did a really good job cleaning up after he left. 
There was one operating land line. 
Morris is checking on the router to see if there's any recent activity. 
Morris? 
 Morris?! 
 Yes. 
 Any luck on the land line? 
 No. I mean, not yet. 
They must have used an inverter to stack their calls 'cause I can't get any records out. 
Mr. Buchanan, jack bauer's on the line. 
Go ahead, jack. 
Bill, I'm near the airport across the street from the grandmont hotel. 
I know. What's going on? 
It's complicated. 
Are the units dispatched? 
We have two units on the way to the grandmont. I'll have them meet you. 
Okay, I want you to contact lapd. 
Have them set up a five-block perimeter around the hotel. 
They need to locate my father and take him into custody. 
 Your father? 
 He's involved in this. 
I'll debrief you as soon as we've got time. 
Were you able to pick up anything on gredenko? 
No. 
The glasgow street house was deserted. 
We're processing it for clu but so far we've come up empty. 
We can't be sure gredenko was even there. 
I think I might have a lead. 
 What is it? 
 Charles logan. 
 Logan? 
 I spoke to him. 
He says he has information on gredenko. 
How the hell did you trace this to logan? 
Through my father. Bill, I need you to get me a helicopter that can take me to him. 
He's at his retreat in hidden valley. 
He's under house arrest. 
House arrest? How was that possible? 
He was involved in the murder of david palmer. 
He brokered a closed-door deal. 
He plead guilty to obstruction of justice. 
The public never even knew of his involvement in aiding terrorists or david palmer's assassination. 
 Give me that helicopter. 
 We have one in the area. 
Shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to have it rerouted to your location. 
Thank you. 
Marilyn. 
Jack. 
What happened? 
My father escaped. 
I don't know where he is. 
He might be in the area. 
I want you both to go back to ctu. 
Josh, I know that there's a lot to explain, and I promise you when this is over, you and I are going to sit down and I will talk you through what happened. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 You're not coming with us? 
 No, gredenko wasn't at the house. 
I need to follow up another lead. 
 Take these people back to ctu. 
 Yes, sir. 
Josh, get in. 
Jack... 
thank you. 
Thank you for saving my son. 
He reminds me of you. 
You can see it in his eyes. 
Marilyn, please, you have to go. 
Okay. 
Gentlemen. 
Sign in, sirs. 
We'll need to process you again, mr. Carson. 
Of course. 
 What's your occupation? 
 I'm a policy analyst with the stanton institute. 
State your business here. 
I'm here to consult on civil defense procedures. 
At the request of tom lennox. 
Test, one, two, three. 
: Test, one, two, three. 
 Thank you, sirs. 
 Thank yoU. 
Thank you. 
We've got a problem. 
Tom lennox tried to warn secret service about us. 
What?! 
I stopped him before he was able to alert anyone. 
But I had to restrain him. 
You said that lennox was on board with the plan. 
I thought that he was. Either he's changed his mind or you're right and he's been playing us all along. 
Regardless, we're gonna have to deal with it. 
Son of a bitch. 
We've got to move him. 
I'm going to need this space. 
Get me some tape. 
Let's go, over here. 
Sit down, hands behind your back. 
We're going to have to take care of him. 
Make it look like a suicide. 
No. 
No. 
Listen, eliminating president palmer is for the good of the country, all right? 
It's the only way to get him out of office. 
Killing tom lennox only benefits us. 
 We don't have any choice. 
 Listen. Tom lennox is a very smart man. 
Now I think that once vice president daniels is holding the reins, and enacting the policies that lennox himself created, we can convince him to keep quiet. 
I'm not gambling my life on lennox's good judgment. 
Look, it's a risk, but it is a risk that I'm willing to take. 
We're not cold-blooded murderers. 
We're just trying to save our country. 
Either way, we do not have time to resolve this now. 
Assad goes before the cameras within an hour. 
You said it would take 25 minutes for you to assemble this? 
25 to 30. 
Then you better get started now. 
If we're going to frame assad for the assassination, then this bomb has to explode when they're both together. 
then this bomb has to explode when they're both together. 
We're never going to have a better chance than now. 
Reed. 
Yes, melinda. 
I'm still waiting for the briefing stats that tom promised me. 
Well tom just e-mailed them to you. 
They should be on your screen by the time you're back at your desk. 
OKAY By the way, is tom in his office? 
Uh, no, no. 
Um, no, tom is down in conference B. 
He's meeting with some policy analysts from langley. 
I just came from conference B. 
Secret service is meeting in there. 
Well, they must have switched to another room, then. 
Listen, I'll try to track tom down for you. 
what is it, morris? 
I have to uplink these traffic vectors to the homeland sub-net. 
I've been trying, I've been trying and it just won't go through. 
 Check your S. I. P. Adapter. 
 What about my S. I. P. Adapter? 
You've specified the wrong slot assignment. 
Oh, what an idiot. 
Thank you. 
That'll work. 
Did you call your sponsor? 
I'm getting tired of you giving me the third degree. 
Yeah, well, I covered for you. 
I didn't tell anyone you took a drink. 
I didn't take a drink- I spat it out. 
I told you. 
 You promised me you'd call your sponsor. 
 And I did. 
Well? 
We had this long talk. 
I feel a lot better, really. 
You're not acting like iT. 
Why don't we install a breathalyzer at my work station? 
Will that satisfy you? 
I just want to make sure you're okay. 
I helped terrorists arm a nuclear bomb today. 
I'm not going to be okay for a long time. 
That doesn't mean to say I can't do my job. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to swap out this server port. 
Where's morris? 
He's swapping out a server port. 
He's supposed to be checking on gredenko's landline. 
Well, he's juggling a lot right now. Being short-handed, we're all trying to pick up the slack. 
Now, I'm wondering if it's more than that. 
What? 
Look, he's been tortured. He's under a 
lot of stress. Maybe he should be pulled. 
Yeah, he's a little upset, but he's still better than 90% of the tech people we have around here. 
We need morris on the floor. 
All right, chloe, but I'm keeping my eye on him. If I see anything else I don't like, I go to buchanan. 
Fine. 
Hi, this is jeannie. I'm not here right now, but please leave a message and the time of day you called and I'll get back to you. 
Hi, jeannie, this is chloe o'brian. 
You don't know me, but I'm morris's ex-wife. 
Could you call me back as soon as possible? 
It's important. 
I'm at 597-3781. 
Thank you. 
Nadia, jack will be arriving at logan's estate any moment. 
I want tac teams on alert and prepped for redeployment. 
 Yes, sir. 
 We're out of leads. 
Let's hope jack can get something from logan. 
Could we have a moment, please? 
Must have been hard for you to find out about your father's involvement in all of this. 
I'm not here to talk about my father. 
Dmitri gredenko- what do you know about him? 
I know gredenko supplied fayed with five russian tactical nukes, one of which exploded this morning in valencia. 
One of which you managed to disarm, so that leaves us three we need to recover. 
That's correct. 
I get regular intelligence updates. 
And I still have my sources. 
So you need gredenko to find fayed. 
 Can you help us? 
 Yes, I can. 
But you want some kind of plea agreement. 
You're unbelievable. 
I don't blame you for thinking that, jack. 
But I want you to know that I'm not the same man that I was two years ago. 
Just as you're not the same man who was dragged away and thrown into a chinese prison. 
I've changed. 
I've had time to think about what I did. 
I have reconnected with my faith. 
So, no, I don't want a pardon. 
And I wouldn't accept it if it was offered to me. 
 What do you want? 
 Nothing. 
I want to give you the information you need with no conditions. 
I'm listening. 
I never dealt with gredenko directly, but I know how we can find him. 
 How? 
 Through anatoly markov. 
He's the russian consul general, here in los angeles. 
Ctu contacted the consul general as soon as we saw gredenko's name on the list. 
He denied any knowledge of his whereabouts. 
Markov's lying. 
He's been the liaison for gredenko for years. 
Liaison for what? 
For business concerns looking to acquire the products that gredenko provides. 
No, don'T. 
Don't make the wrong play, jack. 
Now if you go down official channels, you'll end up in a hopeless maze. 
Markov has friends in the highest levels of the russian government. 
They can protect him indefinitely. 
If you want to access what he knows right now, you need to go through back channels. 
you need to go through back channels. 
 What back channels? 
 Me. 
I'm your best chance to get the information you need in the time frame you need it. 
 What are you proposing? 
 That I speak to markov myself, in person. 
 Why would markov talk to you? 
 Because I have leverage. 
Markov was involved in the conspiracy that put me where I am today. 
I didn't give him up. 
But he knows I still can. 
I don't trust you. 
If you want to find gredenko, maybe it's time you started. 
go ahead, jack. 
Mr. 
President, thank you for taking my call. 
You said it was urgent. 
I think we have a way of finding gredenko. 
It was my understanding that we lost gredenko. 
Are you telling me we hava new lead? 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. President, 
the lead is charles logan. 
 Logan? 
 Yes, sir. I'm with him now. 
He claims that his administration had dealings with gredenko, and that he has a contact that will lead us to him. 
Who? 
Aanatolyotoly markov- the russian consul in los angeles. 
When we learned about gredenko, jack, I placed a call to the consulate myself. 
 Now that's a dead end. 
 Not according to logan. 
He wants to meet with markov in the consulate in person. 
He says that's the only way that we can get the information we need. 
Jack... 
logan is under house arrest. 
That's why I'm calling you, mr. 
President. 
We need an executive order granting logan a temporary furlough. 
Do you realize what you're asking me? 
Logan was behind the assassination of my brother. 
Sir, I would not be calling if I didn't think this was necessary. 
I don't trust this man, jack. 
This could be some maneuver on his part to gain his freedom. 
I think we need to take a chance on him, and I will enter the consulate with logan as part of his security detail. 
Besides that, I think he's after something else. 
And what exactly would that be? 
Redemption. 
Jack, I have no desire to facilitate any kind of redemption for charles logan. 
Mr. 
President, right now I think he's the only way we're going to find gredenko and the bombs. 
Put him on. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Hello, mr. 
President. 
I want to hear it from your lips. 
Tell me why I should agree to this. 
Because you need me, mr. President. 
It's as simple as that. 
I can speak to the russian consul myself. 
Yes, sir, you could do that, but with all due respect, you'd be wasting your time. 
I have a prior relationship with markov that... we can exploit. 
Again, with due respect, sir, I have more experience dealing with people of markov's character. 
You mean criminals like yourself? 
I know how he thinks, and that's an advantage you can't afford to ignore. 
I want you to know that if this is some kind of move to escape custody, i will commit the resources of my administration to hunt you down. 
i will commit the resources of my administration to hunt you down. 
I can assure you, mr. President, I have nothing like that in mind. 
Several years ago, I was in the same situation, and I... 
reached out to your brother for counsel. 
David helped me successfully navigate that crisis. 
Yes. 
He did. 
And you repaid him by killing him. 
I would like to do for you what your brother did for me. 
I would like to help you get through this. 
Don't make the mistake of assuming this represents any kind of forgiveness on my part. 
I understand that, mr. President, but I hope over time to earn your forgiveness. 
Put jack on the phone. 
Yes, mr. President? 
I'm granting the furlough. 
 Just make it count, jack. 
 I'll do my best. 
Thank you, mr. President. 
This isn't easy for you, is it, jack? 
What? 
The possibility I may not be the same man you've hated for so long. 
You're late. 
Did you have any trouble? 
We had to bypass a vehicle inspection in riverside. 
Other than that, we had a smooth trip. 
Good. 
Let's have a look. 
Open up. 
The U. S. Military has spent millions to develop this drone. 
Today american taxpayers will get a demonstration of... 
what their money has produced. 
According to charles logan, anatoly markov, the head of the russian consulate in los angeles, has information on gredenko. 
Logan and bauer are going to see markov now. 
I want comm locked on any communication outside and possibly inside the consulate. 
Morris, are you still the lead on decoding diplomatic communication leaving the consulate? 
Yes. 
I want you to hand that over to chloe. 
Why? 
Because of what you've been through today. I'm not sure you can handle it, and we can't afford any mistakes. 
Look, I'm perf... 
chloe, I want you to take over morris's workload on the consulate. 
 Hold on a second. 
 It's okay, morris. 
No. No, no, it's not okay. 
It's-it's not okay. I... 
I'd like to say something to everyone. 
I'm very sorry that I gave the reprogramming device to fayed. 
If I could take it back, I would, but I can'T. 
And if you don't think I can do my job, mr. Buchanan, then I should leave. 
But i can do my job. 
Okay, morris. 
Give your task full priority. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Buchanan, I have to disagree with your decision. 
I'm sorry, morris, but I just don't think you're ready. 
Your objection is noted, nadia. 
My decision stands. 
You're wasting your energy. 
And you're distracting me. 
The president's gonna die. 
There's nothing you can do about it. 
People are starting to ask questions about tom's whereabouts. 
Are you on schedule? 
I told you the bomb would be ready in 30 minutes, and I meant it. 
Okay. 
 is there a problem? 
 No. 
You can't go soft on us now, reed. 
No, it'S... 
it's just starting to hit me. 
What we're about to do. 
My god... 
we're killing the president of the united states. 
We're trying to save this country. 
That's all you need to think about. 
Chloe, look at the function prototypes on morris's report. 
 What's the problem? 
 Take a look. 
You mean the missing sectors? 
Yes, the missing sectors. 
Did buchanan make a mistake by reinstating morris too soon? 
No. 
The pentagon put a file lock on these items. 
I told him we could back-fill them later. 
It's not gonna be to anyone's benefit if you're covering for him. 
I'm not. 
Fine. 
Morris, I need you to tell me the truth. 
Have you been drinking? 
I just had a couple of beers, love. 
I didn't think anyone would mind. 
Don't be sarcastic. 
Your data merge is incomplete. 
I had to cover for you. 
I just told nadia... 
whoa, wait. 
What was incomplete? 
Look. 
Oh, for crying out loud, these sectors are irrelevant. 
I only fill them in when I file my final report. 
You know that nadia wants these completed. 
Nadia only wants to prove to buchanan that she was right and that I shouldn't be here. 
No one is out to get you. 
Look, even I know that I shouldn't be here. 
There's a big part of me that wants to go home, crawl into bed and forget this day ever happened. 
But I'm staying, because ctu needs me. 
"he brought me out of a horrible pit," set my feet upon a rock... 
and established my goings. " 
One step at a time, charles. 
One step at a time. 
Logan's almost ready we should be able to get to the consulate within 45 minutes. 
What have you got on markov? 
We ran his name through the interagency sub-net. 
He's a career diplomat. 
Assigned consul general in '96. 
Prior to that, worked in the ministry of foreign affairs for the russian federation. 
No red flags from nsa, interpol or cia. 
As far as they're concerned, he's clean. 
out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. ps27:5;31:8 
Jack, what if logan isn't telling the truth? 
We're out of options I have to trust him. 
You know, we have no jurisdiction at the consulate. 
Just make sure you have teams ready in case logan's lead pans out. 
All right. 
 O'brian. 
 Chloe, contact the highway patrol. 
Have them clear a ground corridor from logan's estate to the russian consulate. 
Yes, sir. 
 hello? 
 Yeah, hi. This is jeannie. 
 You left me a message? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks for getting back to me. 
 So, what can I do for you? 
Look, I know you talked to morris earlier, and that this is probably way out of line and against your confidentiality agreement, but it's just, I'm really worried about him. 
I- I'm sorry, I haven't spoken to morris since I left the program three years ago. 
Hello? 
Okay. 
Sorry to bother you. 
 Have you seen morris? 
 No. I'm sorry. 
 XXXXX  is morris down there? 
I haven't seen him. XXXXXXX 
 Morris? 
 Chloe? 
Morris, what are you doing in there? 
 What? Wait. 
 Open the door! Open the door! 
What the bloody hell is going on? 
I called your sponsor, jeannie. 
She said she hasn't talked to you in three years. 
Are you out of your bleeding mind?! 
I trusted you I put my job on the line for you. 
 You lied to me. 
 I didn't lie to you. 
 Yes, you did. 
 I didn't lie to you jeannie's not my sponsor anymore; ted is. 
 Ted? 
 Yeah. Remember ted with the hair? 
He's my sponsor. 
I called him just like I told you. 
Check if you want I'll give you his number. 
Not now! 
I don't know what to say. 
I was worried about you. 
Marching into a men's room isn't worried, it's obsessed. 
Now, I appreciate your concern. 
I love your concern. 
But, darling, you have to take a look at what's going on in your head. 
It's not pretty. 
Sorry. 
Mr. President. 
From the attorney general, sir. 
The executive order authorizing president logan's release. 
Thank you, melinda. 
The communications director wanted you to know that they'll be ready for an on-camera rehearsal with assad in five minutes. 
Fine. 
Melinda? 
Have we heard from tom lennox? 
No, sir. I've been trying him. 
There's no answer at his office. 
Find him. 
I want him present for assad's statement. 
Yes, sir. 
sir. 
I'm gonna take that off of you, and I'm gonna clean up that cut, but if you try to call out, carson will kill you and I cannot stop him. 
Do you understand? 
Okay. 
you have got to put a stop to this, reed. 
No, Mr. Lennox. 
When this is done and the president is out of the way, I think that you will see things differently. 
I think that you will see that this is... 
better for our country. 
No, you're going to destroy this country, reed. 
You're just as bad as fayed. 
No, no. 
There must have been a moment when you were onboard with this plan. 
Were you playing us from the beginning? 
Hmm? 
Were you? 
Or did you change your mind along the way? 
I need to know. 
Then know this. 
I was against you from the start. 
that'S... 
...very disappointing. 
Hello. 
Yes, hello, melinda. 
Oh, yes, I'm just with tom right now. 
He's just finishing the briefing. 
You know, I-I understand. 
I will let Mr. Lennox kn right away. Okay? 
Thanks. 
The president is asking for lennoX. 
We've gotta move. 
I'm almost done. 
Finished. 
 It's armed. 
 Okay. 
NoW... 
this is the detonator. 
Press 6-2-4-enter, and a signal will activate the bomb. 
Okay. 
6-2-4-enter. 
Ye. 
Once the signal's been sent, it'll take 15 seconds for the chemicals to intermix. 
The kill radius is only ten feet. 
Make sure palmer's inside it. 
You sure you can do it? 
I'm the only one who can get close enough to that podium without attracting attention. 
I can do this. 
all right, everyone, rehearsal's up in five minutes. 
Please notify the president. 
excuse me, could we have some water for the podium? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
The president is traveling. 
Before we continue, I would just like to express my appreciation. 
You're taking a great risk, Mr. President. 
You and I both are sharing that risk, sir, and maybe that, in and of itself, is something of a victory. 
I just hope that someone will listen to our appeal. 
You sound skeptical. 
The people we're trying to reach, they abandoned the political process a long time ago. 
All we need to do is create a foundation... 
to build on. 
The rest will follow. 
 Reed. 
 yes, Mr. president. 
This is hamri al-assad. 
Mr. Pollock is our deputy chief of staff. 
 How do you do? 
 Hello, sir. 
If you wouldn't mind getting comfortable behind the podium, I'd like to speak to reed for a minute, please. 
Of course. 
 Mr. Alassad? 
 Yes. 
Would you like to review the teleprompter copy before you rehearse? 
That would be fine. 
I've been trying to reach tom for the past hour. 
Is there something I should know? 
Something you should know, Mr. President? 
Reed... 
I know how tom feels about this address, but i was under the impression that he put his opposition aside and was working with me to make this policy succeed. 
Well, I-I'm sure that th's a valid impression, Mr. President. 
Then he'll be here. 
Yes. 
Yes, sir, he will, he will be here. 
Good. 
you try that again and I'll kill you, you understand? 
I should kill you anyway. 
With the president dead, nobody's going to think too hard about why his chief of staff hanged himself. 
Here we go for rehearsal. 
I'm gonna go and check on tom, Mr. President. 
I'll give you a seven-second countdown. 
The last four seconds will be silent. 
All right, here we go in seven... 
six... 
five... 
what is this? 
Bomb! 
Move, Move... 
Sir, please XXXXX Fan out. 
Find him. 
Got him! 
Code 5 in sector three. 
The citadel has been hit. 
Send a medical team. 
I repeat, citadel is down. 
Send a medical team now.
