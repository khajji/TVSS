TheJustice Department is investigating theJonas Hodges car bombing. 
I changed my mind. 
I didn't transfer the funds. 
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid? 
Because it's what you wanted. Am I right? 
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data. 
Okay, we've got him. 
Where's the canister? 
I am not gonna stop until you tell me where it is. 
 Jack. 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 You need to give yourself a shot. 
 I already did, 20 minutes ago. 
 It's not working. 
 You heading home? 
 Yeah. 
 Us too. 
 This is Bauer. 
 I'm sending a link to your phone. 
It's something I think you should see. 
Your daughter's in the company of our operatives. 
Put this call on your earpiece and keep the line open. 
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say. 
You will help Tony Almeida escape, or my people will murder your daughter. 
 The following takes place between 6:00 a.m. And 7:00 a.m. 
Okay. Thank you. 
The Deputy Attorney General is ready for you, ma'am. 
TelePresence call is initiated. 
Network is secure. Go ahead. 
Good morning, Ms. Taylor. Thank you for 
giving up your time for this investigation. 
Of course. 
Mrs. Rollins, Mr. Hock 
are from theJustice Department. 
They'll be conducting your interview. 
Let the record show that this is to be the testimony of Olivia Taylor... 
acting White House chief of staff... 
regarding the homicide of federal witness Jonas Hodges. 
Let it also show that I am present to ensure that strict protocols be followed... 
for Ms. Taylor's protection. 
 Why would I need protecting? 
 Uh, poor choice of words. 
I merely meant that your questioning is just a formality. 
We have to go through everyone who had knowledge of Hodges's whereabouts until the bombing. 
I see. 
Mrs. Rollins, 
you have the floor. Let's begin. 
I wanted Olivia in this briefing. 
Where is she? 
I'm sorry, ma'am, but she's tied up with the Deputy A.G. And investigators... 
Iooking into the Hodges murder. 
 Have they made any progress on who leaked Hodges's location? 
 Not yet. 
But they agree that the list of people who knew Hodges was alive and at F.B.I. Is short. 
The leak had to come from inside. 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 Good morning, Madam President. 
 Madam President. 
 Please take your seats. 
I realize that we are all in dire need of sleep... 
but I felt that it was vital... 
to bring you all up to speed on the events of the past few hours... 
and a greater crisis we face on the horizon. 
Less than 30 minutes ago, the F.B.I. Managed to recover... 
the last canister of the bioweapon. 
But I'm afraid that the danger is far from over. 
Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us... 
that there were other parties involved with him in the creation of this bioweapon a highly secret and extremely powerful group of private military firms... 
collaborating to undermine the government of this country. 
Excuse me, Madam President... 
but which military firms are we talking about? 
We don't know, Admiral. 
Hodges gave us no names or idea of which companies are involved... 
but whoever they are, they represent a very real and ongoing threat. 
Now, we don't have much actionable intelligence at this point. 
However, the F.B.I. Has apprehended 
former C.T.U. Operative Tony Almeida. 
He is a key figure in this plot... 
someone we hope will be able to help us uncover who these people are. 
Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo 3. 
 We're in position. Your convoy's in sight. 
 Roger that, Bravo 3. 
Metro will be controlling traffic and setting up a secure corridor through downtown. 
We'll be bringing Almeida in to headquarters through the west entrance. 
It's almost time, Mr. Bauer. 
The convoy you're traveling with is about to get off on the l-70. 
You'll need to break off before you reach the downtown exit... 
or you'll lose your chance to facilitate an escape for Tony. 
For your daughter's sake... 
you don't want that to happen. 
Now listen carefully. 
You'll need to commandeer the van... 
and peel onto the Taft Street exit in about four miles. 
I'll direct you further once you've managed this. 
Remember, my operatives are with your daughter. 
In fact, I'm looking at her right now, so don't try to be a hero. 
Something wrong? 
It's starting to look like the flight is gonna be full. And I'm on standby. 
Oh, no, you're gonna get on. There have to be 
some people that are too spooked to fly... 
after those planes went down yesterday. 
Bob, did you have to bring that up? 
I'm just saying! Look, I think it makes us safer. 
They're gonna take extra precautions. 
Excuse me. A re those yours? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Would you mind, so my mother could sit down, please? 
Oh. Sure. 
 Oh! You're bleeding. 
 What? 
 You have a scratch on your neck. 
 Honey! 
That must have happened when the door hit you getting out of the cab. 
Oh, well, y- I'll just go to the newsstand and see if they have some Band-Aids. 
 What is it? 
 I'm getting worried. 
It's only a matter of time before that F.B.I. Agent's body's discovered... 
and I think Bauer's daughter is getting suspicious. 
Look, I gave Bauer a short window to deliver Tony to me. 
It won't be long. 
Just stand by until you hear from me. 
And what if Kim Bauer makes us before then? 
You can't allow yourselves to be taken. 
Do what you have to do. 
Agent Walker, let me see your comm unit. 
I want to adjust its frequency. 
It's interrupting mine. Thanks. 
 Don't move. Don't move! 
 Jack. 
Just keep driving and no one gets hurt. 
Both of you, I want you to slowly draw your weapons... 
 put them on the floor and slide them to me. 
 Jack Do it! 
Don't make this harder than it already is. 
Give me your weapon, or I will kill him. 
Come on, Jack. 
You're not gonna kill anyone. 
   Give me your weapon! Now! 
Driver, I want you to handcuff yourself to the steering wheel. Over and under. Do it now. 
You're gonna exit the freeway when I tell you. 
Until then, I want you to maintain speed. 
 Now! 
  Agent Walker, what's happening? 
Agent Walker! 
 Comm, the prisoner transport has split from the convoy. 
Renee, it's Janis. Do you read me? Renee! 
 Are you reading me? 
Agent Walker, what's your 20? 
Agent Walker, please respond. 
 Jack, why? 
 They've got my daughter. 
That's not possible. I deployed Agent Franks 
to watch over her like you asked. 
Agent Franks is dead. The people that are working 
with Tony have operatives with Kim right now. 
 Jack. 
 They've threatened to kill her if I don't break him out. 
 Jack, that's enough! 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Okay. We're on Taft. What now? 
 You'll see the entrance to the Connecticut Avenue tunnel. 
 Take the north lane. 
 Continue down this street. 
Go towards the tunnel, north. 
 Aerial Bravo 3, do you still have a visual? 
 Affirmative. 
The follow vehicles in the convoy... 
are getting off at the next exit and will be doubling back. 
I've got prisoner transport on satellite. 
They're heading west on Hudson. 
Wait. They're pulling into 
the Connecticut Avenue tunnel. 
I'm losing visual. 
Repeat: I am losing visual. 
 Pull up the transponder locators. 
 Yep. 
Okay, we're in the tunnel. 
 You'll see me parked in the emergency lane about a quarter mile in. 
I want you to pull behind that S.U.V. 
Jack, please. I understand your reasons, 
but you can't do this. 
No, what I can't do is risk Kim's life. 
UncuffTony. 
Give me the keys. 
You cuff her. I'll take him. 
They have a camera on Kim. 
I don't trust Tony to let her go. 
Please, I am begging you, do whatever you have to to save her. Please. 
Jack. 
The gun. 
Cuff yourself. 
Come on. 
What are you bringing Bauer for? 
Tony, I've done everything you've asked. 
Just let Kim go. 
 Let her go! 
 Get in the car. 
So what are you doing, Tony? 
We don't need a hostage, okay, especially not him. 
Shoot him already, and let's get out of here. 
You're not seeing the big picture, Cara. 
Your people are gonna be able... 
to launch their biological attacks just as they originally planned. 
How? We lost the canister. 
We don't have the pathogen anymore. 
We haveJack. 
The pathogen's in his blood. 
It's in his organs. 
We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body. 
Why do you think I had you put those operatives on Kim Bauer? 
Your people are still gonna need proof thatJack's viable. 
Have one of your biochemists meet us at the complex. 
Let's begin with the confidential document on the left hand side of the packet. 
Take a moment to look that over. 
 Thank you again for coming. 
 You can thank me, Agent Pierce... 
by telling me what this is all about. 
All right, sir, but we don't have much time. 
 You implied it had something to do with Olivia Taylor. 
 Yes, sir. 
A few hours ago, Jonas Hodges was killed outside F.B.I. Headquarters. 
My God. 
Now, authorities believe he was murdered to keep him from implicating others... 
who were involved in the bioweapon attacks... 
but I suspect there may be another scenario... 
and I have reason to believe that Ms. Taylor might be involved. 
That is an outrageous accusation, Agent Pierce. 
Olivia is capable of many things... 
but I can't believe committing murder is one of them. 
Mr. Kanin, please just hear me out. 
After the president agreed to a witness protection deal for Hodges... 
Ms. Taylor made a comment to me... 
about wanting to see Hodges dead. 
He was responsible for her brother's death. 
She was venting. 
I thought so too... 
until she met in her office with an old colleague of hers, a man named Martin Collier. 
 I know Collier. 
 Then you know the sort of man he is. 
I do, but none of this constitutes proof of complicity. 
No, sir. That's why I need you to access 
the digital recording system to see if their conversation was recorded. 
Agent, you're asking me to break into an office that's no longer mine... 
and access classified recordings of the acting chief of staff. 
Mr. Kanin, if my suspicions 
prove correct... 
you, of all people, understand how grave these consequences would be. 
Sir, Ms. Taylor's behavior over the past 
several hours has been erratic at best. 
Now, she's with theJustice Department investigators now, and we don't have much time. 
Sir, I need you... 
to decide if you're gonna help me. 
If you could just again review the records on the screen below, Ms. Taylor... 
I want to confirm that during the timeline in question you had no outside contact... 
other than what's reflected in the phone and Internet logs you uploaded to us. 
For the third time, that's correct. 
We're just trying to be thorough, ma'am. 
I think we've taken up enough of your valuable time, Ms. Taylor. 
Thank you for, uh, indulging us. 
You're welcome. Good luck 
with the rest of the investigation. 
She's coming. 
Sir. 
She's on her way. 
Ms. Taylor, I tried to get word to you 
but was told you were not to be disturbed. 
Word to me about what? 
 Let me explain. 
  Good morning, Olivia. 
Ethan. 
What are you doing here? 
I'd forgotten some files when I cleared out my office, so... 
Secret Service was kind enough to admit me so I could retrieve them. 
May I see them? 
Nothing terribly important. 
But I like to fully archive my memos for, uh, posterity. 
You understand. 
So you have what you came for. 
Um, I think so. 
Well, then if you'll excuse me Of course. 
Agent Pierce. 
Stay a moment, please. 
 What was he doing here? 
 Ma'am? 
Kanin. Did you observe him 
while he was in my office? 
Is something wrong, ma'am? 
Yes. Yes, something is wrong. 
No one, and I mean no one is to be allowed in my office without Ms. Taylor, could I get someone 
on staff to help you with that? 
 Ms. Taylor 
 Security? 
This is Olivia Taylor. 
Ethan Kanin is on his way out of the White House. I want him taken into custody. 
Detain him until I arrive. 
Ma'am, what's happened? 
He stole my property, Aaron. 
Sir. 
Mr. Kanin! Mr. Kanin! 
 Yes? 
 We have orders to detain you, sir. 
Orders from whom? 
From the acting chief of staff, sir. 
Please come with us. 
Sir. 
Command, this is Walker. 
Janis, do you read me? 
 I'm here. Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 What is happening? 
 Jack commandeered the transport. 
He was forced into helping Tony escape. 
Renee, it's Chloe. 
What do you mean, "forced'"? 
The group Almeida's working for threatened to kill Kim Bauer if he didn't cooperate. 
They have Kim? 
According toJack, they have operatives with her at the airport... 
but I don't think she's aware of that. 
 Do you want me to contact airport P.D. 
 No. 
We can't move on these people until we know who they are. 
Chloe, I need you to patch me in directly to Kim's departure gate. 
 She's at Gate 7. 
 I'm on it. 
 I'll brief the White House and let them know what's happened. 
 I'll call when I'm on my way. 
I have a priority one emergency call from F.B.I. 
Please connect me with an agent at Gate 7. 
for Flight 147, nonstop to Los Angeles. 
Maintenance crews have finished preparing the aircraft... 
and we should be ready to begin boarding in approximately 10 minutes. 
Thank you again for your patience. 
Would the following standby ticket holders please report to the ticket agent counter Marissa Boily, Kim Bauer, Robert Leighton. 
 Well, looks like I got on the flight. 
 Told you you would. 
and pending for Indianapolis... 
we do apologize for the delay at this time. 
     Kim Bauer? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll take you over here. 
 Okay. 
Phone call for you. 
Hello? 
Kim, this is Renee Walker. Listen carefully. 
Try not to react and do not look around. 
You're in danger. You're being watched 
by operatives sent by Tony Almeida. 
Tony? I don't understand. 
He's involved with the people responsible for the attacks. 
We had him in custody, but he used you as leverage... 
to force your father to break him out. 
I don't believe that Tony would do something like that. 
He's on the run, Kim. He's taken your father 
hostage. You've got to trust me on this. 
I'm on my way with a team to you now, but we have to I.D. The people who are watching you. 
They're our only lead to finding your father and Tony. 
There was a man that was staring at me earlier... 
but I haven't seen him in a while. 
 Describe him. 
 He was Hispanic. 
Medium build. He had short brown hair. 
He was wearing a suit. 
That was Agent Franks. 
Your father had me deploy him to the airport... 
to make sure you got on the plane safely. 
He was killed by the people following you. Listen, Kim. 
Whoever these operatives are, they're in close proximity to you. 
Your father told me they sent him a live feed to prove they had you in their sights. 
Have you noticed anyone with a camera or cell phone? 
 Or a laptop? 
 What? 
There's a couple that I've been talking to. 
They're sitting right next to me. 
The man has an open laptop right in front of me. 
 Can you give me a description? 
 Yeah. He's got long hair, he's tall 
 Kim? Kim, what's wrong? 
 Oh, well, I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you. 
Please let baggage claim know that I will be much more careful next time. 
Kim? 
 Chloe, do you read me? 
 I'm here. 
The operatives may be moving on Kim. A lert 
airport police. Have them lock down the terminal. 
Tell airport security to maintain patrols. 
Do nothing to arouse suspicion. 
Okay. 
Okay. Bye. 
We saw you were on the phone. We thought 
there might be a problem. You need some help? 
No. There's no problem. 
I left my electric toothbrush on in my luggage. 
So the airline called and said they broke my lock. 
 Nice. You get your boarding pass? 
 Oh, yeah. It's right here. 
There was a little security problem with her luggage. 
Guess they can never be too careful. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
This is the first time that I've been apart from my little girl. 
I'm just a little anxious to get back to see her. 
 Would you like to see a picture of her? 
 Sure. 
Got one in here. 
Here it is. 
Yeah. 
Where is... Here. Yeah. 
 Her name's Teri. 
 She's adorable. 
Thank you. 
Look at this. So cute. 
That's my husband, actually. 
This is-Aww. 
Take her. 
 Let me go! 
  Code two! Code two! 
Suspects are armed! 
Get down! 
Walker. 
It's Kim Bauer. Security's down. 
Where are the airport police? 
They're mobilizing to you now. 
What about the operatives? 
The woman is dead. 
The man is getting away. 
Kim, we need him to find your father. 
 What direction was he headed? 
   Agent Walker! 
   Damn it! 
 Kim? Kim! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Olivia. 
I always liked that about you, Ethan. 
Even when I was a little girl, you always stood up when I came into the room. 
Old habits die hard. 
You removed something from my office. 
 I want it back. 
 I told you before, you're welcome to them. 
 You know damn well I'm not talking about those files. 
 Do I? 
Ethan, I found the digital recorder. 
Now give me what you took... 
or I'll order the security officers outside this door to strip-search you. 
All right. I do have a recording. 
It's a personal account of my last days in service to this administration... 
and I think I'm entitled to it. 
No one is entitled to take sensitive material out of the White House. 
Oh... 
now it's national security you're worried about. 
As a matter of fact, yes. 
Well, I still have my clearances. 
Why don't we listen to the recording together? 
You're in no position to dictate terms, Ethan. 
You're in violation of at least 10 federal laws. 
What are you so afraid of, Olivia? 
What's on there that's so incriminating? 
I'm not the one facing incrimination. 
You are. 
But give me the recording right now... 
and I'll see to it no charges are filed. 
Last chance, Ethan. 
Search him for a data card. 
I'm being held without cause. 
I demand to speak to President Taylor. 
It was the president who ordered his detention. 
If that's true, I want to hear it from her directly. 
Well, this is a criminal matter now. 
Considering her personal relationship with Mr. Kanin... 
the president doesn't deem it appropriate to intrude on the investigation. 
Please stand up, Mr. Kanin. 
Arms up. 
You're making a terrible mistake. 
Ms. Taylor is grossly 
overstepping her authority. 
Thank you, Agent. 
 Process him out. 
 Come with me, Mr. Kanin. 
I don't think you understand the seriousness of what you're doing. 
I don't think you do. 
Agent Hobson. 
I can take him the rest of the way. 
Fine. 
She's definitely hiding something, Agent Pierce. 
Lucky for us, I'm a paranoid son of a bitch. 
May I ask what was on the other data card? 
Nothing. It's blank. 
I can try to get you into the communications office so you can listen to that. 
Too risky. And unnecessary. I have 
a companion device to the recorder in my car. 
Well, it sounds like you were, uh, expecting this. 
One has to be prepared when you're dealing with Olivia. 
I'll let you know what I find. 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
We're gonna use you to reconstitute the bioweapon, Jack. 
Put him on the table, face down. 
How long till we know? 
 It depends. 
 On what? 
On the levels of pathogen in his spinal fluid. 
 Give me a time frame. 
 Fifteen minutes. 
Good. Get started. 
Tony. Tony! 
 To  We've gotta give him something to control the seizure. 
I need him completely immobilized. 
There we go. 
I'll contact the group as soon as we know if Bauer's viable. 
 Yeah. Look, I need to talk to you first. 
 What is it? 
I want a larger role in the organization, and I think this is a good time to make my case. 
Tony, we've gone over this before. Okay? 
It's not how it works. 
You don't ask in. 
 You're invited in. 
 All right, then get me an invitation. 
Look, after what I've done today, I think I've earned it. 
You have been resourceful, it's true. 
 Still  Look. 
I know you talk to the top guy. 
All's I'm asking is that you get us in the same room together. I'll sell myself. 
 I don't think that would be the right approach. 
 Why not? 
Because he's careful to a fault, Tony... 
and he's very protective of his anonymity. 
I can appreciate that. 
But the bottom line is, without me this operation never happens. 
Now, you have influence over him. 
He trusts you. You can convince him. 
I've seen you do it before. 
 This is different. 
 That's right. 
It is different. 
This time it's for me. 
I'm ready to extract the spinal fluid. 
 Hold his head still. 
 All right. 
 He knows, Martin. I'm telling you. 
 No, Olivia, he doesn't. 
Worst case, he has a suspicion. 
He never actually had the time to listen to the recording, did he? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 And he never will, because you destroyed the data card, right? 
 Of course. 
Then we're fine, all right, so long as you keep thinking clearly and don't panic. 
You're forgetting, I ended this man's career, Martin. 
He won't let me off the hook. Ever. 
You're the president's daughter, okay? Trust me. 
No one will come after you without hard evidence, least of all Ethan Kanin. 
 Olivia. 
 I've gotta go. 
President's been looking for you. 
She needs you in the Oval Office. 
 What's going on? 
 A situation unfolding at the airport involving Tony Almeida. 
 We're about to be briefed, and she wants you in on it. 
 Okay. 
Everything all right? 
Yes. Fine. 
We need help over here! 
Stand back. 
 Did you see which way he went? 
 It was chaos. 
There were people running everywhere  Janis, it's Renee. 
 Go ahead. 
The male operative remains at large. 
Kim Bauer is missing. 
Either she went after him or she's a hostage. 
Issue a priority alert across all channels. 
 Yep, that's it. 
 We got it. We're on our way back up. 
Officer, my name is Kim Bauer. 
I followed the man that shot up the terminal. 
You need to contact Special Agent Renee Walker with the F.B.I. 
Kim Bauer. 
 Kim, it's Renee. Go ahead. 
 I've got him. He's in the south parking garage. 
 Are you in visual contact? 
 No. He's on one of the upper levels. 
I'm at the exit. 
 Copy that. We're coming towards you. 
 Hurry! 
Hang on. Help is on the way. 
Oh, God. 
No! 
 Move! Move! Move! 
  Go! Go! Go! 
   Kim! 
You're hurt. Let me see your arm. 
No, listen to me, Renee. That laptop 
has the camera they were using to track me. 
With a D-11 inverse router... 
we may be able to backtrace the signal to the people that have my father. 
I worked at C.T.U. Systems analyst. 
Is there anyone back at your office that can help us with this? 
 Yeah. I've got Chloe O'Brian standing by. 
 Get her on the phone. 
 Once this happens, once it goes through, you can never go back. 
You will live with it for the rest of your life. 
 I don't need a lecture on conscience from you, of all people. 
I have thought this through. 
What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this. 
He has to pay for what he did. 
The virus load is even higher than we hoped for. 
Ten-plus in spinal fluid alone. 
Not enough to reconstitute the pathogen, of course. 
We'll still need his organs for that. 
He doesn't look too good. 
How much longer does he have? 
Couple of hours, give or take. 
And what happens if he dies before we extract the pathogen? 
Obviously, it's optimal to keep the host alive... 
but the pathogen can survive up to two hours after death, sometimes even longer. 
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it... 
is by exposure to extreme temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. 
Make sure you put that in your report. 
I have. And I've already 
uploaded it to your computer. 
Good. Get him ready to move. 
Get the stretcher. 
Bauer is viable, but you'll need to secure a facility. 
That won't be a problem as long as you're absolutely certain that we can accomplish this. 
We've already done the hard part, Alan. 
And from what I understand, with the proper equipment... 
the actual extraction and bioengineering is fairly straightforward. 
Okay, Cara. 
I'll contact the others. Good work. 
They should know they have Almeida to thank for this. 
 He's the one who realized Bauer was a possible source. 
 Relay my gratitude. 
I think you should consider going farther than that. 
"Farther"? What did you have in mind? 
Tony believes in what we're doing. 
He wants to play a larger role. 
That sounds premature to me. 
The thing is, Alan, if we don't make a significant gesture... 
I'm afraid we may lose him. 
I don't even know this man, Cara. 
Then you should get to know him. 
Are you suggesting I meet with him? 
Look, all I'm saying is that he would be a very useful voice in the mix. 
His field experience fills a knowledge gap in regards to our logistics and planning. 
Coming from you, that's a hell of a recommendation. 
There's no one better, Alan. 
And it's not as if you haven't vetted every other member of the group. 
Maybe it is time that he and I met. 
I could be there, where you are, in the next half hour. 
You're coming here? 
I think it would be a good idea if I supervised Bauer's transfer myself... 
Make the others feel at ease, don't you think? 
But, Cara, I'll look Almeida in the eye... 
and if for any reason I don't like what I see You understand. 
I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive. 
I understand. 
He wants to meet you. 
He'll be here in a little while. 
Thank you. 
It's up to you now. 
Wheel the gurney closer. 
Get that. 
Son of a bitch. 
He's gone! Come on! 
He's too weak to have gotten very far. 
Cover the north exit. I'll go this way.
