           Drive one.            
That was bob cornell at nsa.     
    They've detected             another firewall breach.         
 There's been another attack?    
 Not yet, but they believe the    cip device is being utilized.   
We have to assume dubaku         is initiating another attack.    
        Madam president.         
        What is it, tim?         
I've just been forwarded             a scrambled call.            
                      It's from                  colonel dubaku.  
                 He's demanding               to speak with you.  
 The deadline for your forces    To begin their withdrawal                  has passed.            
    Go to the window.            
    See what you have done.      
    Comply with my demands           within the hour,             Or 10,000 more americans                 will die.                
     She's on her way up.        
 I'll call you when it's done.   
Mr. Taylor,                      
are you okay?                    
        (groans)                         (grunts)                 Audio forensics                  cleaned up the recording.        
Nichols (over computer):              walker is extraneous.       
 Kill her before you get here.   
Larry, I don't think             it's worth it.                   
There's nothing here.            
            All right. Fine,     
          Help janis coordinate                        with nsa.  
I'm sorry                        about renee.                     
She was a good agent.            
         We don't know                that she's dead yet!        
     I've devoted my life                 to the bureau                       And you just expect                    me to believe  That the entire government's                     been corrupted.  
             Jack:                    not all of them.            
  But until we find out who,         we can't trust anyone.       
      And the four of you        really think you can stop this?  
                    We have to.  
        It's as simple as that.  
Dubaku wants you and your wife.  
    That's the deal.             
    You're asking us                 to risk our lives                    To be delivered into                     dubaku's hands.  
      Listen to him, ule.        
But how can we                   trust this man?                  
                        Because  He has no reason                 to lie.                          
        Nichols:                 how are you doing, tony?         
          All right.             
                      Buchanan:              where's emerson?     
          He's dead.             
You want matobo                  or not?                          
        (gunshot)                  You got what you came for.     
Now, get the hell                out of here.                     
  Did everything go smoothly?    
     We have the matobos,             that's what matters.        
I heard about the planes                  on the radio.           
        The white house              still has not complied.      
What do you intend to do?        
Exactly what we promised.        
We're ready, sir.                
             Where's the target                      located?     
Kidron, ohio.                    
                 Population?     
30,000.                          
Casualties will be high.         
            Begin.               
                         Larry.  
  We think this is the truck      the matobos were abducted in.   
        Where was this                    image taken?            
                Near northwoods                        airfield.  
         Were you able                    to track it?            
        Not beyond this sector.  
          But they were heading      east on mckinley avenue.     
All right.                       
Make sure the vehicle I.D.       
        Is disseminated                to all search teams              And local agencies.        
Yes, sir.                        
     Larry, I think I found              something.               
Yeah?                            
 I've been working nsa, trying    to back-trace the cip attack    That took down the two planes.   
  And I found a code fragment    Which I think could be residue       from the cip intrusion.      
I'm running a pattern            match right now.                 
With any luck at all,            We may be able to anticipate         where in the infrastructure  They're targeting next.          
And I need sean.                 
             Janis, I don't want              to waste personnel        On some wild-goose chase.  
    Dubaku's threatened to kill            10,000 more americans                   In the next 30                      minutes.     
      I understand that,               And I will drop it         the minute it feels cold.        
        All right, I'm going to           brief the white house.  
        Keep me in the loop.     
    Sean.                        
Are you sure he's up to running          this operation?          
                Larry's fine.    
        Is he?                   
  You're the one who told me          about him and renee.        
This has got to be hitting       him pretty hard.                 
    If I don't think                  larry can do his job,             I'll let you know,                   all right?             
     In the meantime, I need you      to open up a fresh socket.  
        (phone ringing)                  (phone ringing)                (ringing continues)                Gedge's voice:                   you've reached                 agent brian gedge.         
    Please leave a message       and I'll get back to you.        
             (beep)                        agent gedge,             I expected to hear from you                by now.              
It's urgent that I speak         with the first gentleman              As soon as possible.        
    (intercom beeps)               Call me back, agent gedge.     
 This is extremely important.    
             Yes?                
          Secretary:             larry moss with the fbi.         
     Where are we, larry?        
    We've I.D.'d a vehicle       
That we believe was used           in the matobos' abduction.     
      We're still trying             to track it down.            
     And how long is that                going to take?           
 I wish I could tell you, sir.   
  I don't have a time frame.     
That's not good enough, larry.   
 Unless you get some results,     we're going to get hit again.   
            A lot of people are                  going to die                     If you don't                     find dubaku.     
         With all respect, sir,          I don't need to be told              what's at stake.     
We're giving everything we can.  
    One of our agents                  has given her life.        
  Yes, I was told about that.    
    I'm... I'm sorry.            
I'll call you the minute               we have something.         
    We'll be waiting.            
        (sighs):                             god....              
Chloe:                           the matobos have been taken      into a building.                 
          546 adams.             
Okay, pull up the stats          on that address.                 
                          On it. 
It's the ritter building,              four stories high.         
The building                     is two years old.                
  Give me the security specs.    
Give me a minute.                
    We're coming up on it.       
I'm going to need                your help.                       
        (beeping)                                I see you've                 chosen a target.     
    The boyd chemical plant            near kidron, ohio.         
                 The cip device                   has enabled us               To take control of                   the main tank.  
We're about to cause the         primary safety valves to fail.   
 Do you remember the last time       we saw each other, ule?      
It was at a state dinner               in your residence.         
We shared an excellent           bottle of wine.                  
    I offered my hand                     in friendship             And you... Slapped it away.    
  You gave me an ultimatum--         To be the puppet                   for your military.         
You could have had a long             and prosperous career             As prime minister.         
But now you're going back                  to sangala              As a traitor to your people.    
     I am prime minister.        
 I was elected by the people.    
    It's you and juma                 who are the traitors.       
No.                              
 We brought order to sangala,    But you are trying               to destroy                       Everything                       that we've built.                
     You'll be taken back            to sangala, ule,             And you will give                general juma                         The names of all                  your fellow traitors.       
     I will never do that.       
            Never.               
            Hmm...               
     Believe me, you will.       
          Take them.             
Any response                     from the president?              
    Not yet.                     
But once she sees                dead americans                   Lying in the street,             she will be less stubborn.       
    I'm inside, jack,              approaching the front desk.    
          Copy that.             
        Are the motobos          still on the third floor?        
      Affirmative, jack.         
     They're being moved.        
 I'm just not sure where yet.    
          Copy that.             
            Good afternoon.      
            I'm agent walker                       with the fbi.  
                I don't have                     an appointment,  But I'm here to see              mr. Roane of roane               
and associates.                  
I'll let them know you're here.  
            Actually, I don't            want to be announced.    
 I'm here on official business.  
          All right.             
So as far as you're concerned,    I was never here, understand?   
Yes, ma'am.                      
Past security.                   
Heading toward                   the elevator.                    
            We're on our way to            the service entrance.  
Chloe, I'm on the third floor.   
Law firm is                      on your left.                    
On your right is a suite         of offices where matobo's                  Being held.            
        I see it.                
 Stairwell's down the hallway             to your left.           
        (hissing)                Agent walker, we're at the door. 
There's one guard outside          the suite, probably armed.     
  Bill, take the third floor.    
      Wait for my signal.        
                 Go on.          
Chloe, we're on the fourth floor       In what used to be               the computer room.         
                 What now?       
In the center                    of the room                      There are two                    removable panels.                
This should give you             access to the crawlspace.        
            Copy that.           
             Okay, we're clear.  
                      Let's go.  
                      We're in.  
  I should never have allowed         you to come with me.        
    It was a mistake.            
It was not your decision, ule.   
     We will be all right.       
                Jack bauer will                    be here soon.  
Okay.                            
We're at the heating unit.       
          Okay, jack,                  there's an airduct             Leading off that unit;               do you see it?           
             Yeah.               
Follow that for about 30 yards            Until you see               an electrical junction.      
         Make a left,                 then another 20 yards       You'll come to the vent.         
This will give you a view        of the entire floor.             
    And the matobos?             
They've been moved               into a adjacent room             Just off the main area.          
            Okay, copy that.     
        Come on.                 
             Sean:                   the entire nsa has been           combing the firewall                 Searching for the next               cip device breach.  
    If this were something,              don't you think           They'd already know about it?   
    I can live without your          negativity today, sean.      
      There it is again,         that same code fragment.         
                "kidron, ohio."  
        what's in kidron, ohio?  
Any sensitive installations?     
Something dubaku                 might want to hit?               
                 I don't know.   
Homeland has a high-value            Target database;               I'm cross-checking it now.     
          Okay. Okay,            
nothing in kidron itself,            But in the neighboring           county there's...            
                  Boyd chemical. 
Boyd chemical.                   
What do they make?               
            Insecticide. Please  
            get me that number.  
            Hello?               
  This is janis gold at fbi.     
        I need to speak               To your plant manager            immediately, please.        
    Ma'am, as I just stated          I'm with the fbi.            
    Does that sound vaguely          important to you?            
                Now, connect me              to john brunner.     
  Fbi? Uh, yeah, put her on.     
     This is john brunner.       
    Janis (on phone):                        hello.               
         Mr. Brunner,            
this is janis gold, fbi,                  D.C. Bureau.            
    What can I do for you?       
      We've been tracking                 some possible             Breaches in the government             firewall.                
    The firewall's designed      to protect installations                  Like yours...           
  I know what it does, honey.    
      Um, we have tracked                 And isolated                 one of these breaches       In the kidron area.              
I need to know                   are you experiencing             Any problems right now?          
As a matter of fact, we're       dealing with one right now.      
          What is it?            
             Three of our safety               valves just failed  On the primary storage tank.    
     We're having trouble                resetting them.          
What's in that tank?             
              Methyl isocyanate. 
              It's concentrated       insecticide, highly toxic.  
    Can you-- what the hell            is this all about?         
  Mr. Brunner, I have reason     
        To believe that            this is a terrorist attack         On your facility.            
    Terrorist attack?            
            Yes, sir, I need                     you to initiate                On-site emergency                       procedures           And stay on this line.  
      Shut down the tank.        
        What's going on?         
         Do it! Do it!           
         My authority.           
                        Damn.    
          What is it?            
      It's not responding.       
What do you mean?                
Try it again.                    
        Nothing.                 
                Pressure in the          primary tank is rising.  
        Son of a bitch.          
          Mr. Brunner?           
            We cannot shut down              the primary tank                 And the pressure                     is building.     
              If we cannot stop          this, we are looking         At atmospheric release.      
                 Okay.           
          Get larry.             
      Dubaku has targeted                that facility.           
            We need to alert                      the president.  
         Mr. Brunner,            
 You need to begin evacuating        people right now.            
    All right, agent moss,           keep me apprised.            
 I'll speak to the president.    
        I just received               an interagency alert.       
        The fbi just discovered            dubaku's next target.  
    A chemical plant, yeah.      
I just got off the phone             with larry moss.             
                 I need to brief                  the president.  
Has the first gentleman          spoken with the president?       
                  Not yet.       
        I talked to agent gedge                  40 minutes ago.  
Mr. Taylor is                    
the only person who              can talk the president           Into withdrawing                 our troops in sangala.           
And that is our best way             to prevent this attack.      
            I know we need him.  
 I'm waiting for a call back.    
  The middle section's still      bothering me; read it again.    
                        Angela:          "colonel dubaku and the          juma regime have killed       "countless thousands             of their own people,            "and now hundreds                of our fellow citizens.      
      They deserve your prayers               and your outrage."  
  I think the word "outrage"           might be too strong                    If you're trying                           to convey  Calm authority.                  
  "outrage" is the only word      To describe how I'm feeling,         and how every person        In this country will be feeling. 
      The american people              deserve the truth.         
Dubaku's already                 killed 300 americans.            
God knows what else              he has planned.                  
      (knocking on door)                 Come in.                 
 Could you excuse us, angela?    
            What is it?          
    The fbi believes                 they've detected                  Where the next attack           will take place.             
        Dubaku's infiltrated                 a chemical plant                     Just outside of                    kidron, ohio.  
He's causing the pressure            on the facility's             Primary tank to go critical.    
If the tank erupts,              over 3,000 gallons               Of methyl isocyanate will        be released into the atmosphere. 
  Given the prevailing winds,                      A very large,              very toxic cloud     Will sweep into town.            
              Methyl isocyanate  Is a concentrated insecticide.   
      Even brief exposure        causes severe lung damage                     And chemical burns                  of the skin.     
    What's our time frame?       
    The tank could rupture       in less than 15 minutes.         
They've begun evacuating?        
        We've already contacted          emergency responders     On the ground in kidron.         
It's just not enough time             to get everyone out.        
     Kidron's population's           just over 30,000.            
This projection says that            We could lose over 50%?      
    Oh, dear lord...             
Ethan:                           right now, our only chance       of stopping this                     Is finding dubaku                  and the cip device.        
    You ready?                   
      Quietly.                   
      Chloe (on earwig):         jack, I just intercepted         An fbi alert identifying              dubaku's next target.       
A chemical plant                 near kidron, ohio,               12 minutes from going            critical. There are 30,000       
  People in that town, jack.     
    We have to hurry.            
        Jack (quietly):                    copy that.             
    Give me the scope                    out of the bag.          
         (bag unzips)                     Turning scope                over to night-vision.       
      I don't see dubaku.        
We've got nichols.               
Three men with                   automatic weapons.               
Three more over                  at the control station,          most likely armed.               
          Copy that.             
That's dubaku.                   
We got dubaku.                   
  Chloe, are you seeing this?    
Yes. The control station         
looks like an s-dart.            
's a really                      powerful processor.              
             It could be driving                  the cip device. 
 Copy.                           
    Nsa's classified                   infrastructure team        Is trying to plug                the firewall breach.             
        Any luck so far?         
          None so far,           but they're staying on it.       
             They have less than     Ten minutes left.            
     They're aware of that, sir,     But they're doing                    what they can.           
    Not now.                     
What's going on                  at the plant?                    
          I'm on with them now.  
              John? Did you try  
Flashing the memory cards?       
         (alarm blares)                  Brunner:                       three times, honey.        
     We're not in control            of the computer system.      
  I've already told my people     to get the hell out of here.    
              Normally, I don't                  allow people             To call me "honey," but       we can discuss that later.  
     Yeah, well, it sounds        like you need to lighten up.    
(alarm continues blaring)                  good, good.            
          I'm heading            to the primary tank room.        
 I'm going to try to manually                    Release some                 of the pressure.     
 That's not going to stop it.    
    No, but it might buy us            A few more minutes             so people can evacuate.      
  I've got a thousand workers        at this facility.            
     And I am responsible            For their safety.            
         (door buzzes)            Now look, I need you to stay             on the phone.           
I'm going                        to need some help.               
                     Absolutely. 
                  What can I do? 
I don't have access                To the override schematics.    
    See if you can pull up       The operating procedures                  for tank one.           
Yeah, yeah, yeah.                
I got it.                        
      I got it right here.       
        All right.               
        Now look                     for the emergency valve          Release sequence.            
    Okay.                        
             Uh, valve release.  
          I have it right here.  
          This, wait,                this procedure is going       To release the chemical right     Into the primary tank room     where you are right now.         
         I know that.            
  I have respiratory gear on.    
         I'll be okay,             just give me the sequence.     
              But how long will                that protect you?  
 Don't worry about it, honey.    
     Uh, okay.                   
Are you looking                  at the routing board?            
             I am.               
        Go ahead.                
        Set the bus switches                 To this sequence                 from left to right:                              Two. 
              Two.               
                          Eight. 
             Eight.              
                          Seven. 
             Seven.              
                        Four.    
             Four.               
                          Three. 
             Three.              
             Done.               
The secondary flow valve         Should be behind you             and to your right.               
             I need you to turn           that clockwise please.  
        (steam hissing)                  (grunts)                           All right.             
     All right, I got it.        
 Okay, that's one valve down,        Three more to go.            
          (groaning)                       (coughing)                  (electronic beeping)        Pressure inside the tank             is approaching 400 psi.      
        How long before                the tank ruptures?         
Seven minutes.                   
                    Nichols:             we've got a problem.     
         What is it?             
                    An alert.    
Our hidden surveillance camera            on the roof.            
             Almeida and bauer.  
     When was this taken?        
        20 minutes ago.          
     I thought you killed              almeida and bauer?         
Damn it! You said                
this location                    Was kept secret                  from everyone!                   
                 It was.         
Then what are they doing here?!  
                I don't know.    
     How did they find us?!      
         I don't know!           
            600 psi and rising.  
         (low beeping)           Disengage the cip module.        
Begin the offload.               
            What are you doing?  
            We're almost there.  
 We will continue this attack        from another location.       
Let's finish this.               
            We can handle them.  
We need to get out of here now.  
 The cip module's disengaged,          starting off load.         
             Sean:                 hey, what the hell is that?    
        What the hell is that?!  
      What's the matter?         
The firewall breach just closed. 
Larry:                           what?!                           
  What are you talking about?    
    No cip intrusion,                the firewall is secure.      
         How? Nsa?               
         I don't know.           
     Bring the cip module.       
Get motobo and his wife!         
             Bill, we should go  With the second option           on the assault.                  
Two-prong attack. You and tony   
come through the main entrance.  
     We'll go in from here.      
        Copy.                    
                 Give me the c4                   out of the bag. 
                    Go!          
             Move.               
                          Move!  
        (gunshot)                            Get the cip device!  
            Clear!               
     All clear over here!        
          Get dubaku?            
        Negative!                
Jack, I've got the cip device.   
     It's been destroyed.        
    Jack, it's renee.            
     The motobos are safe.       
  I'm taking them to the van.    
     Copy that. I want you       
    And bill to do a sweep.      
  See if you can find dubaku.    
  I'll cover the south side.     
John? John, are you still there? 
        (weakly)                              yeah.               
      John, listen to me.        
    The terrorists are out               of the system.           
Please tell me what is happening           right now.             
        (steam hissing)              Automatic shutdown mode              has kicked in.           
     Pressure's dropping.        
    I think we're gonna be                 all right.             
      Okay, that's great.        
Now you-you gotta get out              of there right now.        
      (labored breathing)                (coughs)                              John?               
      (labored breathing)        I can't make the door...         
 I'm sending the rescue team.    
A rescue team                    is on its way.                   
                John, please                     stay with me.    
                  Stay with me.  
      (people clamoring)             Have they found dubaku?      
Still searching.                 
            Renee:               first responders are five              minutes away, jack.        
          Copy that.             
            Get up.              
(gasping)                                     I said get up!      
         (whimpering)                      (quietly):                     they're coming.          
Please don't make                me do this.                      
I will go to your home, michael. 
I'll make you wife watch                               As I kill                   your daughter,                  And then I will                        kill her.  
                So do as I ask.  
    Save your family.            
    Let me see your hands!       
                It's latham.     
    Where's dubaku?!             
          I'm sorry.             
    (device beeping)                         Cover!               
          Tony! Bill!            
Yeah!                            
                  You all right? 
                          Jack?  
             Jack?               
    Jack, can you hear me?       
    Yeah, yeah, we're okay.      
                 What happened?  
    Latham was wired                 with explosives.             
  We still don't have dubaku.    
             What?               
                 The cip device              has been destroyed.  
             I want you to stay                with the motobos.  
        Make sure they're safe.  
     (sirens approaching)        Jack the police are almost here. 
If you get arrested,             this entire operation            goes out the window.             
 You have to get out of there.   
                      Copy that. 
He's gone.                       
                    Buchanan:                 we need to get back               to the safe house. 
Let's go.                        
     (sirens approaching)        Sean, this stays both nsa        and homeland have no idea        Why the breach at the kidron     plant was stopped.               
         They're still looking.  
We're working on it here also.   
     Janis is coordinating        with a digital forensics team   That she sent over to the plant. 
 This doesn't make any sense.    
Why... Why would dubaku suddenly 
        stop an attack           When he was minutes away          from causing mass casualties?   
 Maybe there was a malfunction         in the cip device.         
 No, no, I don't want maybes,      all right? I want answers.     
We're doing everything we can,                sir.                
    That's not good enough             right now, is it?!         
    I don't know what else           to tell you, sir.            
            I know you're upset                  about renee,     But getting angry at me is not   going to make it go any faster.  
If you think I'm yelling at you       because of my history             With agent walker,             you are mistaken.            
 There are thousands of lives            at stake here.           
That's what concerns me.         
          Sorry, sir.            
I want you and janis             to work with nsa.                
Find out where that cip device   is being used.                   
    If we find the device,               we find dubaku.          
    I appreciate the call.       
         Thanks a lot.           
Janis, larry wants               you to interface with nsa.       
See if you can back-trace        that cip code fragment           to its source.                   
        I'll try.                
Who were you talking to?         
 The head of the response team            at the plant.           
    What did he say?             
    Facility's clean.            
A trace amount of the chemical    was released, but not enough        To do any damage,            and the site has been secured.   
         That's good.            
What about                       the plant manager?               
         John brunner.           
          Is he okay?            
              No.                
                    Will you do                      me a favor?  
          It depends.            
    I'd like to track down            mr. Brunner's family.       
I was the last one               to speak with him,                 And I feel they should know        how brave he was.            
I'll see what I can find.        
                     Thank you.  
Janis, before you start          sending flowers,                   You need to find out where     that cip device was being used.  
      I know. I'm on it.         
Cleanup crews                    are already on site              And we're continuing             our evacuation of                a one-mile radius                Around the chemical plant.       
                    Casualties?  
There was, in fact,              one casualty,                                 The plant manager.  
            13 other workers                 are being treated                 For chemical burns                   and inhalation                  of toxic fumes.  
         And there haven't been          any other intrusions                 in the firewall?     
No, ma'am.                       
     It appears the crisis           has been averted.            
Except that no one's been able     To explain how the firewall        break disengaged.            
        Not yet.                 
    The fbi has no idea how      it happened... It just happened. 
                 And that's not                   an explanation. 
Perhaps dubaku was firing             another warning shot.       
No, dubaku's already down                  two planes.            
        He's not afraid                to take more lives.        
         In any event,               we should be grateful.       
I'm not one to accept good news           Unless I know                where it comes from.        
  Until we have more answers,    I want to maintain alert levels. 
         (phone rings)                               Yes?         
    Madam president, I have        admiral smith on line two.     
    Put him through.             
        Thank you, tim.          
        Admiral?                 
I've been trying to reach agent  gedge, and he hasn't picked up.  
     Yes, I'm sure I have            the right number.            
      I just spoke to him            over an hour ago.            
He said he was outside           samantha roth's apartment        Waiting for the first gentleman. 
            (sighs)                      just find him.           
        I don't care who you             have to pull off shift.  
Still can't reach gedge.         
The secret service doesn't know        where he is either.        
            (sighs)               I need to tell the president.   
  Maybe you should hold off.     
  The domestic threat's been             lifted for now           And she's on the phone           with admiral smith.              
              I can't authorize                  the air strikes          Until our post-invasion              plans are in place.  
Finding a politically viable     replacement, until that happens, You need to keep                 your forces at full readiness.   
    The joint chiefs                 are getting impatient.       
Madam president, we need           to talk about your husband.    
          His theory                 about your son's death,      He hasn't let it go.             
  What are you talking about?    
      He's been harassing              roger's girlfriend,             Accusing her of complicity           in the death of roger.  
Henry and I went over it                         Again and again                    with the fbi,               And he swore to me       He was past all that.       
  Well, he's found a private       investigator who's feeding         His conspiracy theory;                   Taking advantage                             of him.  
            Please get henry                       on the phone.  
I'm afraid                       I can't do that.                 
     Henry's unreachable.        
      I don't understand.        
    Agent gedge hasn't been           answering his phone.        
            Now, I wouldn't get              too worried yet.     
You're telling me my husband's            gone missing?           
        Secret service                 has put out an apb.        
            They're going to               ms. Roth's apartment.  
         Whatever's going on, I       will find out soon enough.  
  Secret service dispatcher:      this is a priority order code        charlie zero charlie.       
    We need an immediate 20              on agent gedge.          
         All available                field agents proceed          To his last known location:         404 wilkinson drive.        
        I repeat:                  code charlie zero charlie.     
        (phone ringing)                (ringing continues)              (phone snaps shut)             (breathes deeply)            You're making a mistake.         
Think about it.                  
                    Shut up!     
You haven't killed               anybody yet.                     
    You don't need                     to do this.                
Gedge's plan to frame me             is already blown.            
If you kill me,                    They'll know it was murder,         And they'll trace it                 back to you.            
         (phone rings)                   Go ahead.                
     Where's agent gedge?        
      I can't reach him.         
        Gedge is dead.           
        What happened?           
     Everything was going             according to plan...        
But something                    went wrong.                      
Taylor killed gedge;             I don't know how.                
        Where's mr. Taylor now?  
He's right here.                 
        Don't kill him,              bring him to me.             
        Yes, sir.                
         Prime minister matobo,      ma'am, please come with me.  
Chloe, pull up the ritter        building on a satellite grid.    
Look for any sign of dubaku      leaving the site.                
We've got to find him.           
It's going to take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.           
     Then don't waste time           talking about it.            
              Pull up satellite                and traffic cams,                   Street corners              and metro stations.  
What's the priority?             
 I can only do one thing             at a time.                   
                      Satellite! 
      Fine.                      
Bill, we need to rethink this.   
              What do you mean?  
  You were set up to surveil     an undercover operation.         
Your cover's been blown.         
The police are after us.         
We are not equipped to look for  one man in a city of millions.   
We need additional               resources.                       
    What are you suggesting?     
        It's time                 to contact outside agencies.    
                The government?  
          Yes.                   
         I thought you said the  government couldn't be trusted.  
Right now,                       we don't have a choice.          
                    Almeida:             it can't be trusted.     
    We can't trust anybody,      That's why we're working                 on the outside.          
    President taylor                     can be trusted.          
            I'm not questioning            that, prime minister.  
It's the people around her       who can't be trusted.            
  Mr. Buchanan, jack's right.    
         We need help.           
      It's too dangerous.        
We can limit the flow            of information.                  
Prime minister matobo            can get us past                  The president's outer circle--   that way, we can at least        Explain to her                   why and what we're doing.        
Renee:                           I think jack's right.            
    We left a lot of clues           in that building.            
    We're vulnerable;                we can't do this                         On our own anymore.  
    Am I supposed to remain            in hiding with you,          Pretend that my wife and I             Are still being               held hostage or dead?       
    I need to return                   to the white house           And help the president save      what's left of my country.     
Let my husband do this.          
Let him call president taylor.   
    She will listen to him.      
Bill, you want to find           dubaku, make the call.           
          All right.             
    Get me the white house.      
Reporter: representatives              from boyd chemical         Have assured local authorities   That the immediate crisis                  has passed.            
 However, this has done little         to calm the nerves         Of the citizens of kidron, ohio, Many of whom have taken shelter    in neighboring communities.    
        Again, we have               confirmed one fatality       Inside the plant itself.         
13 others, all boyd employees,       Are being treated              at local medical centers...    
        (intercom beeps)                               yes?       
Madame president, I have prime   minister matobo calling for you. 
                Matobo?!         
          Yes, ma'am.            
             You're tracing it?  
  We tried, madame president,        but it's a secure line.      
            Put him through.     
             Prime minister?     
Yes, madame president.           
        Are you all right?       
      Thank god my wife and I              are both fine.         
    We were rescued.             
        By whom?                 
        Where are you?           
            In a safe place.     
        Madame president,            you need to listen to me.    
The people who rescued us, they  have acquired the cip device.    
    It has been destroyed,        And your country is no longer       under immediate threat.      
     Who are these people,       and tell me how this happened.   
  I will tell you everything               in person,                     But, uh,                   this must happen privately.    
  I must speak to you alone.     
          Why alone?             
They will bring me to you,       madame president.                
 We will arrive in ten minutes.  
I'll be waiting for you.         
 They tried to trace the call,         but the line held.         
Ethan, I need to see you                   right now.             
    Yes, madame president?       
         I just spoke            to prime minister matobo.        
            What?!               
          He's safe.             
      How? What happened?        
    He'll let us know                  when he gets here.         
He's on his way now.             
He wants a private meeting.      
         Bring him in              through the south entrance,             And keep this            to as few people as possible.   
          All right.             
Jack, I've mapped a route          for you to the white house.    
      It's mostly side streets,                But there will be              fewer traffic cams.  
          Okay, good.            
     Send it to my phone.        
We're ready. Let's go.           
 As soon as we set the vehicle   in front of the building,            Agent walker will move                 mr. Matobo.            
                  Jack... Jack!  
             What?               
        I'm not going.           
  What are you talking about?    
    If the government            gets their hands on tony,              They'll arrest him.        
        I already told you--     I did some pretty bad things     before I teamed up with bill.    
Tony, take it from me...         
     You need to deal with           the consequences.            
        And believe me, I will.  
                But not yet.     
        Not till we get dubaku.  
         I'm working on a lead.  
                 I've got a guy                on emerson's crew              Who might have some                intel we can use.  
Let him do this, jack.           
                He's the reason              we got this far.     
             Fine.               
But you give me your word        as soon as this as over,         You turn yourself in.            
We'll stand behind you.          
                     All right,                you have my word.  
Good luck. Be careful.           
        (keys jangling)                (knocking on door)                                 Hey.     
         Hey.                    
             I was on my way to               work, so I thought      I'd stop in and see you.     
I tried calling you earlier.     
          I'm sorry;                     I've been busy.          
      Are you all right?         
      You look exhausted.        
  It's just been a long day.     
      Well, I hope you're still          coming over for dinner.  
            I'm making lasagna.  
  And my sister promises not to   give you any more dirty looks.  
    You haven't forgotten,               have you?                
            No. No.              
    It's just that I've got        some business to attend to.    
  Samuel, you work too much.     
            Every time you come                  into the diner,      You're always on the phone.  
    I have to, maria,                So that, one day,              I can finally take you away         From that awful place           that you work in.            
         Well, we met                 in that awful place.        
             Don't forget that.  
             I'll see you later. 
Okay.                            
        (line ringing)                   Vossler:                         go ahead.                
Have you got mr. Taylor?         
             Yes.                
 I'm about three minutes away.   
    There's a korean grocer           opposite my building.       
         One of my men               will meet you out back.      
     Bring taylor inside.        
 What are you gonna do to him?   
        Just make sure                you weren't followed.
