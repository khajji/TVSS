=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents Yeah. 
Mark Hauser? 
Who's this? 
You know who it is. 
MARK:  I already gave you  what you asked for. 
But your employer has tightened security, so the access I paid for is no good. 
It'll take some time to download the new security protocols. 
I'll give them 40 minutes. 
Federal agent! 
Down on the floor! 
 Bill, Hauser admitted  to selling Gredenko the security specs for Edgemont nuclear power facility. 
Does Gredenko have the specs? 
Not yet. He's going to pick 
them up in about 20 minutes. 
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother that Gredenko knows. 
We're going to use him  to go through  with the transaction. 
You look nervous, Brady. 
All teams, take out your targets. 
There's a third hostile inside the vehicle! 
You know who I am and you know what I'm going to do to you unless you tell me where the bombs are. 
First my terms: amnesty from your government and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia. 
Nadia's being processed as an enemy combatant. 
I don't know if I can accept that she betrayed us. 
She spied for Fayed? 
 I think we're wrong. 
I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends. 
Yeah. Why do you ask? 
'Cause I came across evidence at the switching station that proves Nadia's innocent. 
You're clear, Nadia. 
Admiral Smith, is the Vickery ready to launch? 
It's seconds from optimal launch position, Mr. Vice President. 
Good, proceed with the strike. 
HAYES: Vice President Daniels is about to launch a nuclear strike against the Middle East. 
This strike is a complete reversal of everything your brother was working for. 
You want Dr. Welton 
to bring him out of the coma. 
Yes. 
(phone rings) It's for you, sir. 
Yes. 
I've called off the strike, Noah. 
I'm resuming my duties as Commander in Chief. 
Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's to be no hostile action without my direct authorization. 
It's apparent to me that the president is still suffering the effects from the attack on his life. 
I can't let him remain in power. 
Get me the Attorney General. 
LENNOX: Secretary Dawes, can you see and hear me clearly? 
Yes, I can. 
What about Secretary Durant and Attorney General Graves? 
Their connections are being set up now. 
How about the president? 
He should be arriving any moment. 
What are you doing? 
I need to get up from this wheelchair. 
No, you need to take care of yourself. 
Sandra, I can't afford to look weak. 
Roosevelt did just fine from a wheelchair. 
Listen, when I face Daniels, I want to be on my feet. 
Dr. Welton? 
Yes, sir? 
Can you give me a shot of adrenaline? 
Wayne. 
I can. 
It'll raise your blood pressure, which is not what you need right now. 
Could elevate the risk... 
(knocking) Mr. President, 
it is time. 
Give us a few minutes, please. 
Yes, sir. 
Excuse me, Mr. President. 
Mr. President... 
Just do it. 
Now. 
(phone beeps) What do you have, Jack? 
Gredenko offered us Fayed in exchange for immunity and a guarantee that we won't extradite him back to Russia. 
Bill, I don't trust him. 
He rolled over too easy. 
What do you think his play is? 
I don't know yet. 
Well, it's your call, Jack. 
But you should know what's happening in Washington. 
President Palmer's regained consciousness. 
How is he? 
Well enough to reassert his claim on the presidency. 
but Daniels is challenging him under the 25th amendment in large part so he can go ahead with the nuclear strike against Fayed's country. 
Does he have a chance of winning? 
It's unclear, but if Fayed detonates another bomb, no one will be able to stand in Daniels' way. 
If there's a challenge for the presidency, the immunity agreement will have no authority. 
It won't be binding. 
Bill, you need to understand that I have no intention of honoring this agreement. 
Tell the Attorney General, fill out the papers. 
I'm calling him right now. 
The president should be here momentarily. 
Mr. President. 
Mr. President. 
Mr. President, 
I know I speak for everyone here in saying how very happy I am to have you with us again. 
Let's proceed. 
(Lennox clears throat) LENNOX: As you know, an attempt was made to assassinate the president. 
He sustained injuries so serious that the doctors had to induce a temporary coma in order to relieve the pressure on his brain. 
In so doing, they saved his life. 
The question now is whether, in the words of the 25th amendment, he is unable to discharge the duties and powers of his office. 
Mr. Lennox, 
isn't this really a medical question? 
Well, to a degree it is, but the 25th amendment puts the final decision squarely in the hands of the Cabinet. 
May we hear medical testimony? 
Yes, we may. 
And to that end, let me bring in the surgeon in charge of the president's case. 
Dr. Welton, 
if you would, please. 
The president has undergone an ordeal, but from a medical point of view, I believe the greatest danger is passed. 
His cognitive functions are presenting normally. 
I have every expectation that President Palmer will make a full recovery. 
GILES: Might the pressures of the office increase the possibility of a relapse? 
It's difficult to say. 
It's certainly a possibility. 
Can you estimate those chances? 
I'm afraid I can't. 
If you had a vote, Doctor, how would you cast it? 
This is precisely the question which the Constitution demands that this Cabinet answer. 
Thank you very much, Doctor. 
Uh, Mr. President, I think now 
would be an appropriate time to address the Cabinet, if you would, please. 
The vice president initiated this process because I stopped him from launching a nuclear strike against the Middle East. 
But this vote shouldn't be about policy. 
According to the Constitution, you're judging me to see if I am unable to discharge the duties of my office. 
Well, as you can see, and as you were just told by my physician, I'm in complete possession of my faculties, and so to remove me from this office would be to betray both your oath and the American people who voted me as their president. 
All right, Mr. Vice President. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet, the 25th amendment is purposely vague on how you're supposed to judge if a president is unable to discharge his duties. 
It's open to interpretation, which is why this is very much about the president's policies and his actions. 
Here are the facts: When a second nuclear attack today spread radiation over one of our major cities, I decided it was necessary to launch a retaliatory strike to show our enemies that if attacked, we would make them share our pain. 
Wayne Palmer's first act upon regaining consciousness was to stop that strike; to respond to the attack by doing nothing. 
In a time of war, the president must be strong enough in body and mind to defend this country. 
And I'm afraid Wayne Palmer's actions are the proof in this matter that indeed, he is unable to discharge his duties. 
All right, time is of the essence, so unless there's an objection, I would like to recess and then reconvene for your vote in ten minutes. 
Any word on the Cabinet vote? 
No, they haven't come back yet. 
Look, Milo, about what happened today, let's just put it behind us, okay? 
Oh, which part, the suspicion of terrorism or the... the other thing? 
The suspicion. 
And the other thing? 
Let's not worry about it right now. 
Let's try and get through the day. 
Okay. 
I'm not going to forget about the kiss, and I don't think you are, either. 
(phone rings) Nadia. 
Nadia, it's Doyle. 
Don't say my name, just listen. 
All right. 
Okay. I need you to come up 
to my office right now and don't say anything to anybody, just come. 
On my way. 
(sighs) Have a seat. 
Look, I know you and I got off to kind of a bad start. 
A bad start? 
You assaulted me. 
This country is under attack by Islamic terrorists. 
We had reason to believe there was a mole in this building. 
Starting with you wasn't racist. 
It was common sense. 
Oh, okay, so you're not a racist, you're just a sadist. 
You don't know me. 
I think I do. 
Why'd you call me here? 
It turns out there was no mole. 
The terrorists were able to hack into our system 'cause someone screwed up and logged the wrong security parameters. 
I'm pretty sure that someone was Milo, and the proof is on his computer. 
I need someone to get it without him noticing. 
I can't do that. 
Why? Is it 'cause 
you're too busy deciding if you want to sleep with him? 
Listen, if you don't get the evidence for me, I'm going to call a forensics team, and they're going to come and tear his system apart as the entire floor watches. 
And if they find what I think they're going to find, everyone gets to watch Milo hauled out of this building in handcuffs. 
I'm sure it wasn't pleasant when it happened to you. 
But you're going to stand by and watch it happen to him? 
That's your idea of being a friend. 
So you want me to betray him for his own good. 
I promise you, Milo will be better off if you help me than if you don't. 
Your call. 
If the Cabinet sides with you, what are you going to do about Daniels? 
Unfortunately, Karen, the Constitution doesn't allow the president to fire his vice president. 
No, but you can marginalize him. 
Karen's right. 
Get him out of the bunker. 
I would love to, but Daniels has way too many supporters, and I can't afford to alienate any one of them right now. 
Besides, I'd rather have him somewhere where I can keep an eye on him. 
Mr. President, 
the Cabinet's reconvening. 
Thank you. 
HAYES: All right, let's go. 
Please, sit. 
All right, ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet, let us now begin the vote. 
Will those of you who believe that President Palmer is able to discharge his duties please, at this time, raise your hand. 
Do we have any abstentions? 
Uh, the vote is seven to seven. 
LENNOX: Mr. Attorney General, 
what would be the next step? 
Well, there's no need for a next step. 
The amendment requires that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet agree. 
There is no majority in the Cabinet. 
It's split evenly. 
President Palmer remains in office. 
NOAH: It's not that simple one of the Cabinet votes is invalid. 
LENNOX: Uh... sir, 
wh-which vote is not valid? 
National Security Advisor. 
What are you talking about? 
She resigned. 
I resumed my duties. 
I don't agree. 
And I haven't seen any evidence that you've been reinstated. 
That is ridiculous! 
I sat here with you in a Cabinet meeting less than one hour ago! 
Ms. Hayes, 
allowing you to sit in on the meeting isn't the equivalent of formally recognizing you as National Security Advisor. 
In fact, I did not and do not so recognize you. 
Oh, my God! 
And if Ms. Hayes' 
vote is invalid, then the tally's seven to six in favor of invoking the 25th amendment and removing... 
President Palmer from power. 
I'm sorry, Wayne. 
Noah, don't waste your apologies on me, because I won't let you steal the presidency. 
That's just not going to happen. 
And what do you suggest? 
The country has to be governed. 
LENNOX: Well, I would suggest, sir, that this is properly a matter for the courts. 
I concur. 
We don't have time to go to... 
GRAVES: Mr. Vice President, if I may. 
I agree with Mr. Lennox 
this is a legal question. 
The Supreme Court was in session this afternoon. 
We can recall it and have them render a decision regarding the validity of the vote. 
The whole matter could be resolved in well under an hour. 
Well, thank you, Attorney General Graves. 
Why don't you simply get the process started, and keep us advised of your progress. 
Certainly. 
I think this meeting is concluded. 
(quietly): Get my affidavit started. 
Tom. 
You know something? 
I'm beginning to think you're not on my side. 
Well, sir, I'm on the side of the United States of America, and if you ever thought otherwise, you were very much mistaken. 
Gredenko's attorney approved the immunity agreements. 
Yeah, we're just waiting for digital signatures. 
All right. 
I'll inform the attorney general's office it's on its way. 
Thank you. 
Milo. 
What's up? 
I'm having a problem with my station it keeps telling me to refresh the system credentials. 
Uh, it's the hardware codes. 
You have to reset them in the machine room. 
I can take care of it. 
Thanks. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
(laughs softly) Well, you were right. 
Milo forgot to refresh the security parameters. 
The breach was his fault. 
So when you tell District, they can fire and maybe even arrest him. 
Which is why I'm going to alter the logs so they'll never know. 
(sighs): This should work, as long as they haven't changed the password. 
(beep) There. It's done. 
Why'd you do that? 
'Cause all I care about is finding those nukes, and we have a better chance of doing that with Milo on board, whether he likes me or not. 
"And mankind was naught by a single nation." 
You've read the Koran. 
Yeah, and the Bible and the Upanishads. 
Anything I can get my hands on. 
You're lucky you found your answers. 
I'm looking for mine. 
I'm going to get ready to deploy. 
What did Doyle want? 
Nothing. We were just 
reviewing some data sets. 
Oh, your... system's back up. 
Thanks. 
(phone rings) Buchanan. 
HAYES: Hi. It's me. 
Hey, how did the Cabinet vote go? 
It was a tie, which, in effect, means that Palmer's still in office. 
Good, that's good. 
That's what we wanted. 
Yes, well, Daniels is contesting the vote. 
He's saying that mine is invalid. 
Based on what? 
Based on the fact that I resigned, and I was never officially reinstated. 
That's ridiculous. 
You attended Cabinet meetings; you had no replacement assigned. 
How does he explain that? 
I know, but maybe he's right, Bill. 
I did hand in my resignation. 
Which was rescinded before it was officially accepted. 
Daniels knows that. 
He's grasping at straws, Karen. 
I'm so scared, Bill. 
If he wins... 
this will all be my fault. 
Stop, stop. 
It's desperate maneuvering on his part, Karen, nothing more. 
He hasn't got a case. 
And the Supreme Court will agree. 
Well, we're giving our arguments in 15 minutes. 
Call me as soon as the decision is in. 
Thank you for being there. 
You don't have to thank me. 
It's my job. 
(laughs) I miss you so much. 
I miss you, too. 
I'll talk to you soon. 
Bye. 
(long sigh) (Gredenko speaking Russian) (man speaks Russian over phone)  Dasvidanya. 
(snaps cell phone shut) Good. My attorney 
has verified the agreements. 
Bill, we're set. 
Gredenko's ready to make the call. 
All right, Jack, we're standing by. 
Doyle's got a team ready to go as soon as Fayed tells Gredenko where to meet him. 
Copy that. 
You try and warn Fayed with anything you say or how you say it, and I will kill you right here right now. 
I believe you, Agent Bauer. 
Make the call. 
(phone rings) Yes? 
It's me. 
Do you have the security protocols for the power plant? 
Yes. 
Where do you want to meet? 
Are you certain you're not under surveillance? 
Of course. 
Do you think I'd be calling you otherwise? 
I can't allow another one of your mistakes to disrupt my plans for the remaining two devices. 
Do you want the protocols or not? 
Where are you right now? 
Culver City. 
Meet me at the Santa Monica Pier in ten minutes. 
GREDENKO: Um, it may take me more time. 
I won't wait. 
Where do I find you? 
Just be there. 
I'll find you. 
Give him the phone. 
Bill, how long will it take Doyle's team to make it to the pier? 
He's about 30 minutes out, Jack. 
We'll make due with Ryan's team. 
Put him in the vehicle. 
Instructions from the Supreme Court. 
Our arguments have to be submitted in writing, in the next ten minutes. 
Sandra's working on our brief. 
How's it coming? 
I'm just about finished. 
We have a strong case. 
You resigned, and Daniels was in charge when you returned, so the legal question is, did he consent to your reinstatement? 
Of course he did. 
And he made no objections when you returned to the bunker, you sat in his first Cabinet meeting, and he never questioned your right to be there? 
No, he didn't. 
His own actions prove our case. 
Thank you... 
for everything, Sandra. 
My affidavit explains everything that I never really intended to reinstate Karen, I was only allowing her to perform her duties temporarily, therefore, she had no authority to cast a vote under the 25th amendment. 
The problem is, after Karen returned, you treated her as if she were still National Security Advisor. 
It's really a question of my state of mind, though, isn't it? 
Yes. And your state of mind 
will be inferred from your actions. 
Doesn't sounds like you think our chances are very good. 
I don't. 
Then I am... deeply afraid 
for our country. 
When the world sees that Wayne Palmer isn't willing to fight back, our enemies will be encouraged. 
These recent attacks will be just the beginning. 
America will be vulnerable in a way it never has been. 
There may be a way to illuminate your state of mind more explicitly. 
I can swear an affidavit that, earlier today, you told me to inform Karen Hayes you had no intention of reinstating her. 
But that you were going to allow her to perform her duties on a temporary basis only. 
Then Wayne regained consciousness before I could have that conversation with her. 
Lisa, you're talking about perjuring yourself in front of the Supreme Court. 
I'm aware that it's perjury, but the end justifies the means. 
My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favor so that you can do what's right for this country. 
You're right. 
Do it. 
Prepare your affidavit. 
And, Lisa... 
...thank you. 
Yes, sir. 
Kasim, Hassan, with me. 
I'm meeting Gredenko. 
I'll be back within the hour. 
And if you're not? 
Are you worried for me, Halil, or just anxious to take my place? 
I think we're wasting time. 
We have the bombs. 
We should use them right now. 
Gredenko's information  will enable us to inflict damage across half of California. 
There's other target out there that will result in large amount of casualties without the additional risk. 
I've made my decision. 
Let's go. 
Come in. 
Mr. Vice President, 
I need to speak with you alone. 
There is something in this room you need to know about, sir. 
Something in this room? 
What are you talking about? 
This small object here is a microtransmitter. 
After you directed me to lie to the ambassador about the attempted assassination, I decided it was time to protect myself. 
Now it turns out I was protecting the country as well. 
Be careful, Tom. 
Be very careful what you try to do here. 
Actually, sir, you are the one who needs to be careful here. 
LISA: I'm aware that it's perjury, but the end justifies the means. 
My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favor so that you can do what's right for this country. 
NOAH: You're right. 
Do it. 
Prepare your affidavit. 
Turn it off. 
As I'm sure you're aware, sir, conspiracy to commit perjury is a felony offense. 
Now, I strongly urge you to pick up that phone and call the Supreme Court and tell them that you have withdrawn your affidavit, and that of Ms. Miller as well. 
Tell them that you support the vote of the Cabinet. 
That you have no further objections to President Palmer continuing his presidency. 
You do understand that I'm just trying to do what's right for this country. 
Well, so am I, sir. 
Karen, I need the launch protocols the Joint Chiefs set up with Vice President Daniels along with chain of command signing. 
They just came over from the Pentagon. 
Everything is in place. 
If the court sides with you, you can cancel the strike permanently. 
I also need want an update on the situation with Fayed. 
(hoarsely): Has CTU made any progress? 
Yes, they have Gredenko in custody. 
The last time I talked to Bill, they said they were going to use him to lure Fayed out in the open. 
Who's running it? 
Jack Bauer. 
Good. 
SANDRA: Wayne. 
The Supreme Court was just notified Daniels withdrew his suit. 
What? 
It's over. 
He gave up before the court had a chance to make its decision. 
Why? 
I don't know. 
I just know that you're still the President of the United States. 
(breathing heavily) Let the Cabinet know I won't take any action  against those who sided with the vice president. 
Yes, sir. 
Oh, and, Karen, tell Bill I want him to keep me up to date on CTU's progress. 
(breathing heavily) Melinda. 
Tell Dr. Welton I need 
to see him, please. 
I don't have a visual yet, but Fayed won't show himself until he sees Gredenko. 
BUCHANAN: Understood. Ryan, 
what's your status with Gredenko? 
RYAN: I've got the audio transmitter set up. 
I'm preparing the tracker now. 
Roll up your left sleeve. 
JACK: What's its range? 
We can track the isotope's signature up to 15 miles. 
Copy that. 
(winces) Is it radioactive? 
Yes. 
It penetrates into the bone. 
It's got a half-life of about 11 hours, so you can forget about trying to dig it out or making a run for it. 
He's good to go. 
JACK: Bill. 
How far out is Doyle's team? 
About 20 minutes. 
We can't wait. 
Fayed was clear about his timeline. 
Ryan, send in Gredenko. 
Gredenko's moving now. 
CHLOE: I'm getting a clean audio signal from the transmitter on Gredenko. 
And we are locked on the isotope signature that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm. 
(phone ringing) Hello. 
Hello? 
I have the gain on Gredenko's transmitter up all the way. 
There's no one on the other end of the call. 
He's reading something off his phone. 
It's a text message. 
Fayed's made contact. 
Everyone get ready. 
Gredenko is heading south. 
Milo, have you got him on the tracker? 
Yeah, he's still moving. 
I'm heading in. 
I'm going to follow him. 
* * I've lost audio signal. 
I'm going to secondary channel. 
There's no audio on the secondary channel. 
But he hasn't moved. 
I don't like it. 
Something's wrong. 
You led them to me. 
I had no choice. 
But if you listen to me, we'll both get away from here alive. 
Kasim. 
Which direction, Milo? 
I'm nearing the south end of the pier. 
That's where he stopped and entered the building on the left. 
Is he still inside the room? 
Yes, he's right on the other side of the door. 
I'm going in. 
Milo, no one's in here. 
Jack! The tracker's 
showing the signal right there in the same room with you. 
My God. 
He cut off Gredenko's arm. 
Ryan, move your men in now! 
RYAN: Roger that. Let's go. 
Hold on. 
I've picked up his blood trail. 
Fayed, their men will be coming from the west side parking lot. 
We should go this way. 
Ryan, have your men circle back to the east side of the pier. 
Try and cut them off. 
Ryan, have you got anything? 
Negative. 
How far out is Doyle's team? 
20 minutes. 
Have him set up a perimeter as soon as he gets here. 
Ryan, where are you?! 
I'm pinned down! 
Moving towards you now. 
Show me your head. 
TV REPORTER: But sources indicate that the same terrorist cell is most likely responsible for the nuclear explosion in Valencia... 
We're trapped. 
This way. 
That's him. 
I recognize him from the news. 
He's the terrorist they're looking for. 
MAN: That is him. 
You bastard. 
Federal agent! 
(two gunshots) I am a federal agent! 
I'm taking this man into custody. 
Now, back off! 
Back off! 
He shot my friend. 
I'm sorry about your friend. 
We'll get him medical attention. 
Just stay back. 
I hope your friend is dead. 
Shut up! 
Everybody out of the bar now! 
Move! 
Gredenko is not here. 
I need you to lock down the area and initiate a search. 
We have two men down. 
One is a civilian, the other is Fayed. He's in custody. 
I need Medical up here now. 
All right, Jack. Good work. 
Nadia, get me the president, please. 
I understand you're weak. 
Another dose of adrenaline will raise your blood pressure levels even higher, to the point where we know there'll be vascular damage. 
And that's a risk I'm willing to take. 
Your well-being is my responsibility. 
And my responsibility, Doctor, is to the well-being of this country. 
So give me another dose so I can go back to doing my job or I will find someone else who will. 
MELINDA: Mr. President, 
Bill Buchanan is on line one. 
I'll take it. 
Thank you, Arthur. 
Yes, sir. 
Bill. 
Mr. President, I'm calling 
to tell you that Jack has Fayed in custody. 
What about the bombs? 
We haven't finished the radiological scan yet, so we can't confirm the bombs are in the immediate vicinity. 
Jack is going to interrogate Fayed as soon as possible. 
But there's no way of knowing how long that will take or how successful that will be, right? 
No, sir. 
All right, Bill. 
That's what I wanted to know. 
Thank you, sir. 
But since the case was withdrawn, the court has no reason to retain the documents. 
They should be sealed and returned to me immediately. 
Okay. Good. Thank you. 
I was thinking that maybe it's time to declare a truce. 
Okay. Well... maybe it is. 
You know, we both want the same thing for this country what's good for the country. 
We just don't always agree on the means. 
I would love to go forward without the threats and the intimidation. 
Done. 
Good. 
One more thing. 
Do you know why the vice president withdrew his suit from the Supreme Court? 
No. I have no idea. Why? 
Well, one of my aides saw you with him before it was announced. 
I... I guess just put this down 
to happy coincidence. 
For now. 
But someday I'd love to know the realstory. 
Okay. Some day. 
(phone rings) Lennox. 
He... 
This cannot be, this has got to be some mistake. 
I'm on my way. 
President Palmer. 
What? 
He's about to go ahead with the nuclear strike. 
Mr. President. 
If I may, sir. 
I understand you're about to launch the very strike we just prevented Vice President Daniels from launching. 
That's right. 
This makes no sense, sir. 
I mean it's what you risked your life to stop. 
Tom, I risked my life to reassert my authority. 
I've got Vice President Daniels calling me weak. 
Even you thought the same thing. 
I implore you, sir, do not mistake being reckless with being strong. 
Tom, I am done talking. 
Mr. President. 
We have a successful launch. 
Good.
