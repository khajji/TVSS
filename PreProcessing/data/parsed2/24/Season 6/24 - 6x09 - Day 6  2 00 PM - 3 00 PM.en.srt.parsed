JACK: That's hyocine-pentothal. 
You will experience a pain I can't even describe. 
At 8cc's, I run the risk of inducing heart attack. 
Four cc's! 
That's 8cc's total, Jack. 
His vitals are spiking across the line. 
Four cc's! 
(screaming) The connection you found between Dad and Gredenko had to do with a contract that was awarded to us. 
What did an ex-Russian general have to do with the contract? 
It was his job to release the old nukes... 
into the U.S. 
for decommissioning. 
He knows you didn't tell him everything. 
Yeah, and I won't. 
You know I won't, Dad. 
Have to be sure. 
(muffled grunting) (muffled screaming) I would like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere to come forward with any information regarding Fayed. 
I certainly can't reach out to them for help, but I know you can. 
Fayed has already called me a traitor. 
And many others will follow him if there is even a suspicion that I am an American puppet! 
Not a puppet, a partner. 
At least when it comes to finding these nuclear weapons. 
The President just rejected every one of my proposals. 
REED: A change in leadership is imperative to ensure this nation's security. 
I'm not talking about holding hearings. 
Something more... immediate 
would have to happen. 
This is the engineer? 
You've got the wrong man. 
(grunts) FAYED: You're going to modify this so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs. 
You will do it. 
The question is how much pain will be inflicted on you before you comply. 
(Morris screaming) (gasping, screaming) Stop! 
I'll do it. 
Arm it. 
Very good. 
(pumps shotgun) TURNER: Fayed's already gone. 
The reprogramming device that Fayed had me build for him, if it's not here, it means he took it with him. 
And with it, he can activate the other bombs he has anytime he wants. 
(helicopter rotors whirring) * * (phone ringing) Yes? 
FAYED: I have the arming device. 
But I had to leave one of the suitcases behind. 
What happened? 
CTU found me. 
I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape. 
The delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high-priority targets. 
Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three. 
More than enough for our needs, Gredenko. 
You just make sure the delivery system arrives on schedule. 
The trucks have left Nevada, and they'll reach the location within two hours. 
Good. 
You can use the time you have to reprogram your targeting software. 
Call me when it's completed. 
(vehicle engine starts) Since the FAA was unable to track Fayed's chopper, we have to assume it set down somewhere outside the containment area. 
We may not know where Fayed is, but we do know he's in possession of a device that will enable him to activate the three remaining suitcase nukes in his arsenal. 
Our only potential lead was uploaded from the hard drive of a laptop recovered at the scene by Jack Bauer and his team. 
Milo. 
There was an e-mail fragment I was able to restore from the computer's hard drive; it made reference to recent communications between Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko. 
Gredenko is the former Soviet general in charge of turning over Russian nukes to the U.S. for decommission. 
Ultimately, he was the source of the weapons Fayed now possesses. 
So, clearly, Gredenko's more involved in this than we realized. 
What's his interest in helping Fayed? 
Gredenko's an ultranationalist. 
His desire to harm this country, economically and otherwise, Have we gotten any updated intel on his location? 
BUCHANAN: Interpol just confirmed he's no longer in Moscow. 
Since the point of origin fingerprint on the e-mail fragment was Pacific time, I think it's safe to assume he's somewhere on the West Coast, possibly Los Angeles. 
Chloe, run a data sweep through INS and customs channels. 
See if we can track how he got in the country. 
(sighs softly) Morris. 
We have to take him to Medical. 
I just want to talk to him for a minute. 
Are you okay? 
Give us ten minutes. 
Bill. 
Jack. 
We able to pull anything off the hard drive we found? 
We have. 
Apparently, Fayed's been in contact with Dmitri Gredenko. 
Gredenko? 
It's looking more and more like he's been aiding Fayed's operation all along. 
You think he's here in Los Angeles. 
Evidence on the hard drive points to that. 
What leads do you have on Gredenko? 
Your father's company was contracted to dispose of the nukes Gredenko was to hand over. 
My brother Graem oversaw those contracts, not my father. 
He still might have some information. 
Okay, fine, I'll talk to him. 
Where is he? 
He went to see your brother's body in the morgue. 
Okay, thanks. 
Chloe, you all right? 
Yeah. 
Thank you for saving Morris's life. 
Yeah. 
I'm really glad Fayed didn't kill you this morning. 
Me, too. 
I have to talk to my father. 
I... just want to thank you 
for everything. 
* * Dad. 
Whatever your brother may have done, he didn't deserve this. 
I didn't mean for this to happen. 
Yeah. 
Well... 
Dad, I'm sorry about Graem. 
I am. 
But right now, CTU wants to know about your connection to Dmitri Gredenko. 
What? 
We believe that he's working with Fayed. 
They want to know what you know about him. 
He was the Russian liaison on our government contract to decommission Soviet nukes. Why? 
What kind of dealings did you have with him? 
Couple of phone calls to Moscow, that's about it. 
Do you know of any contacts that Gredenko might have which would allow Fayed to move the remaining four nukes? 
Look, Jack, like I told you, I had virtually no involvement. 
Graem oversaw the project, he dealt with Gredenko. 
Whatever you need to know died with him. 
You know where Marilyn is? 
No. 
Why? 
You gonna question her, too? 
She's probably with Josh. 
He's taking the death of his father pretty hard. 
Leave them alone, Jack. 
Let them grieve in peace. 
I'll make a call to some of the company executives. 
About Gredenko. 
Maybe Graem shared something that I wasn't privy to. 
Thank you. 
DOCTOR: Try to rest. 
You're doing very well. 
You can go in now. 
Morris? 
How are you feeling? 
Say something. 
What is there to say? 
You were tortured. 
You held out as long as you could. 
I armed a nuclear bomb. 
You had to. 
Fayed was gonna kill you. 
I wish to God he had. 
Because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he wants. 
You can't blame yourself. 
When the next bomb goes off, and thousands of more people die, everybody will remember that I was the one that made it possible. 
That's not gonna happen. 
'Cause we're gonna find Fayed and we're gonna stop him, and none of this will matter. 
Are you any closer to finding him? 
No. 
Just go, darling. 
Go. 
(phone rings) Yes, Mr. Bauer? 
We've got a problem. 
Gredenko's here. 
In L.A.? 
Are you sure? 
Yes. 
Only, they don't know where he is. 
We've got to get to him before they do. 
If Gredenko implicates me, everything the company I founded and spent my life protecting it's over, you understand? 
Yes. I'll put a 
team together. 
I'll monitor CTU from here. 
If I hear of anything, I'll call you. 
Yes, sir. 
I don't care what you have to do. 
You find Gredenko, and you kill him. 
Understood. 
I talked to my father about Gredenko. 
He said he'd make some inquiries, but I think it's a dead end. 
He doesn't know anything. 
The news from here isn't much better. 
But Milo managed to trace the fragment he pulled off Fayed's computer to a local I.P. network. 
It confirms Gredenko is definitely here in L.A. 
I've got my people monitoring chatter, data-mining interagency backlogs on Gredenko's activities prior to going underground. 
Right now, that's all we can do. 
Okay. 
Have a seat, Jack. 
What is it? 
It's the toxicology report on your brother's body. 
Forensic evidence indicates that the hyocine-pentathol you administered to Graem during his interrogation caused his coronary. 
There's something else. 
I saw the field tape, and Rick Burke's report for Division. 
He said you exceeded protocols, even after he warned you of dangerous levels. 
That's true. 
Agent Burke tried to warn me. 
Then you pulled a gun on him. 
You must realize how this looks, Jack. 
Coming right after your brother tried to kill you. 
I lost control. 
Because you found out he was responsible for David Palmer's assassination. 
Yes, because I found out about David Palmer's assassination. 
'Cause I found out about everything. 
I lost control. 
I tried to tell you I didn't think I could do this. 
This job. 
I wanted to kill my brother. 
I wanted him dead. 
I was standing over him... 
and I looked up and I saw my father in the doorway... 
and everything just stopped. 
I ordered Agent Burke to shut down the IV, he did. 
I thought we caught it in time. 
Bill, I did not set out... 
to kill my brother. 
I swear to you. 
I can adjust the report before I send it to Division. 
No. 
Jack... 
an Internal Affairs investigation will impede our search for Fayed and Gredenko. 
Right now, you are critical to that. 
You cannot cover this up. 
I ordered Agent Burke to administer the hyocine-pentathol. 
I killed my brother. 
Whatever the consequences are, I accept them. 
Bill... 
do this right. 
Okay. 
I'll submit the report as is. 
There is some difficulty with my statement? 
A little more emphasis on religion, and less on politics than I expected. 
Many of the people you wish me to sway have been persuaded that our cause is a holy one. 
I am not innocent in this manipulation. 
So I must address them in these terms if I am to enlist their cooperation. 
(knocking on glass) Yes? 
Excuse me, sir. 
Vice President Daniels is calling for you. 
Would you like to take it in your office? 
No, I'll take it in here. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me. 
Noah? 
Thank you for taking my call, Mr. President. 
I know you're pressed for time. 
What can I do for you? 
I'll get right to my point. 
I've made no secret of my disappointment that you rejected Tom Lennox's plan for mass internment of Arab nationals in our country. 
The plan did not delineate country of origin, Noah. 
It was nothing more than a blanket proposal to arrest and detain thousands of Muslims living here, without due process I might add. 
Be that as it may, since, as I understand it, the terrorists have now acquired the capability to arm the three remaining nuclear weapons, I'm asking you to reconsider. 
And I thought I told you that my decision was not open for debate. 
Well, that's unfortunate, Mr. President, 
since the majority of your Cabinet feels that you're making a tragic mistake. 
I respect that. 
But I firmly believe that our best chance of stopping further attacks will come from the intelligence drawn from Islamic communities. 
And you hope to obtain that by letting a known terrorist leader address the world on American airwaves. 
The man has murdered countless innocents over the past 20 years, and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him. 
Not entirely... 
but to the extent that he can help us, yes. 
Mr. President... 
you approached me to be your running mate because you knew I could deliver voters who questioned your... 
experience, who were afraid that your Presidency would be too weak on national defense, and I... assured them 
otherwise, but now you're proving them right. 
There's a thin line between conviction and stubbornness. 
You can stand firm, but just know that... 
you're standing alone. 
Are we done? 
Clearly. 
You are paying a very high price for doing this. 
Not as high as my country will pay if I'm wrong. 
As someone who has alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course, I suggest you tread carefully among your people. 
Mr. Assad, our cultures 
are very different, sir. 
It's not just a cultural issue, Mr. President. 
It's simple human nature. 
They will come after you. 
I assure you of that. 
You sure it's safe to talk in here? 
Yes, this area is currently unmonitored. 
All right. 
You intimated you had some sort of plan of dealing with the President. 
Palmer's refusal to implement your proposals will unquestionably lead to the loss of many more American lives. 
And I, and many others like me who love this country, will not stand by idly and let that happen. 
So what is it you propose? 
I think you know. 
I need to hear. 
Definitive action. 
We are in the middle of a national crisis and he is in over his head. 
He's brought this on himself. 
Listen, before you start reconsidering and report me, just know I will deny that we ever had this conversation. 
I'm not... 
I'm not reconsidering. 
I know what you're saying is necessary, I just... 
cannot believe it has come to this. 
Who else is involved? 
You don't need to know that. 
I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. 
Right now you're dealing with me. 
Vice President Daniels, is he involved? 
No. 
The vice president doesn't know anything about this. 
But we do know that he shares our sentiment in regard to the current state of affairs, and that he will enact your initiatives once he has the power to do so. 
You seem pretty certain this is going to work. 
More so with your help. 
I need the President's itinerary. 
Specifically, in regards to Assad's televised address. 
I do not have the proper clearance. 
I need you to access it. 
Why? W-why do you need this? 
Damn it, Reed. 
We're talking about removing the President of the United States. 
Do not keep me in the dark here. 
I never said that I was the architect of this. 
I'm just a conduit. 
Besides, for your sake, I think that it is very important that we maintain a certain level of plausible deniability. 
The less you know, the better. 
I'll get you that itinerary. 
Marilyn. 
Hi. 
I heard you were with Josh, I didn't want to disturb you. 
Yeah, well, he's taking it pretty hard. 
He loved his father very much. 
I'm very sorry. 
You don't owe me an apology. 
Maybe they haven't told you the circumstances of Graem's heart attack. 
They told me enough. 
Look, Jack, I know the kind of man Graem was. 
Even if he did die because of your interrogation, I don't blame you. 
I blame him. 
The truth is, I've been trying to leave Graem for years. 
But he threatened to take Josh away from me. 
Said I'd never see him again. 
Did Josh know what he was like? 
No. 
I always tried to protect him from the truth about his father. 
What have you told him about his father's death? 
Only that he had a heart attack. 
That's enough for now. 
Yeah. 
I'm sorry, I have to go back to work. 
If there's anything I can do. 
Is it true there are more bombs out there? 
Yes. 
Are you any closer to finding them? 
No, we've hit a road block. 
Right now we're looking for a Russian operative who we believe is helping the terrorists. 
Graem knew him. 
Russian? 
A man named Gredenko. 
You know him? 
No. 
Come here. 
But you know something. 
Maybe. 
It was probably nothing. 
It was months ago. 
Marilyn, anything you can tell us might help. 
Graem was going out a lot at night, and, uh, he said it was work related, but I didn't believe him. 
I thought he was having an affair on me, so one night I followed him. 
It wasn't out of jealousy. 
It was... it was 
for leverage. 
Anything I could use against him to get custody of Josh if I left him. 
Where did he go? 
It was to a house in West L.A. 
I went to the window. 
The blinds were drawn, but I could hear him inside talking to some men. 
They had Russian accents. 
What were they saying? 
I couldn't hear them clearly enough, and frankly, once I realized he wasn't cheating on me, I got in the car and went home. 
Do you remember the address of the house? 
No. Jack, I'm sorry, 
I wasn't paying attention, I was more concerned about getting caught. 
Marilyn, it is vital that we find this man Gredenko. 
If we retrace the route that you took that night, do you think that you would recognize the house? 
Maybe. 
Maybe? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. I think so. 
Wait right here. 
Jack. 
I think I might have a lead on Gredenko. 
It's a real shot in the dark, but right now we don't have anything. 
I wanted to know if I had your permission to follow it up. 
What do you got? 
Hey, Marilyn. 
Hey, Phillip. 
How you doing? 
I'm hanging in there. 
What's going on with you and Jack? 
He's looking for someone. 
He thinks I can help. 
You mean Gredenko? 
He questioned me about the same thing earlier. 
What do you know about him? 
Nothing really. 
I followed Graem to a house one night. 
He, um, he met with some Russians. 
What house? 
I don't know. 
It was in West L.A. 
Jack wants to take me over there to see if it can jog my memory. 
Phillip, I don't know how long this is gonna take. 
And I can't leave Josh alone. 
Could you please stay with him? 
Yeah, sure. 
Thanks. 
Your Tac team's assembling outside. 
I'm sending Milo along with you. 
Milo? Why? 
I want a tech available to pull intel off any computers we might find at Gredenko's location. 
Chloe will be running point from here. 
Okay, fine. 
I'm sorry about leaving you, sweetheart. 
But I'll be back as soon as I'm done helping Uncle Jack. 
Helping him with what? 
Where are you going? 
I'll explain later. 
Right now I want you to stay here with your grandfather, all right? 
Marilyn. 
I was thinking maybe I would take Josh back to my house. 
Why? 
Why can't you just wait with him here until I get back? 
Marilyn, look, he's frightened of this place. 
Understandably so. 
I think he needs to be in familiar surroundings right now. 
All right. 
All right, I'll, um, I'll clear it with Mr. Buchanan. 
Will you explain things to Josh? 
Yeah, sure. 
All right, you listen to your grandfather. 
He's in charge. 
Phillip, thank you. 
Sure. 
Sorry to take you away from Josh. 
All you need to do is identify the house. 
I promise you I will not put you in any danger. 
I know. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
I'd like it if Josh's grandfather could take him back to his house. 
Of course. 
We should go. 
Bill, I'll be on comm. 
We'll be leaving soon, Josh. 
I have to make one phone call. 
Just be a minute. 
MAN (on phone): Yes, sir. 
Have your men find and secure a house in West L.A. 
Fine. 
I'll text you with the address. 
Morris, we have a lead. 
Jack's sister-in-law thinks she knows where Gredenko is. 
Jack and a Tac team are heading over there now. 
I need your help running tactical. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
We're shorthanded. 
So get your shirt on, and let's go. 
Running tactical is what you do best, why would you need my help? 
Oh... I get it. 
You came in here to give me a pep talk. 
Get me back working behind that computer and everything will be tickety-boo. 
Why don't you be a little less obvious, Chloe. 
I'm a coward, not an idiot. 
Morris, I know you've been through a lot today, but you're really starting to piss me off. 
Well, let's add that to my list of failings. 
Why did you do that? 
I didn't want to. 
Look... 
if you're gonna try and save a bloke... 
save someone who's worth it. 
Stop it, stop it. 
Jack and his team are entering a hostile situation and they need CTU back up. 
Yes, I can do it alone, but there'd be less chance of a mistake if you would help. 
So why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself and get back to work! 
Milo, we just passed 98th Street. 
Roger that, Jack, we're maintaining our position six blocks behind you. 
I can't imagine what you went through in China, Jack. 
When you were over there, I thought about you. 
I tried not to. 
I guess, I've been trying not to think about you for over 20 years. 
Marilyn, we don't need to talk about this. 
It was your father, wasn't it? 
He drove you away. 
Tried to pressure you to work for his company. 
Is that why you left, and enlisted in the military? 
There were a lot of reasons. 
Was I one of them? 
No. 
(phone rings) Hello? 
Marilyn, it's me. 
Don't say anything... 
just listen. 
I don't want Jack to know I'm on the line. 
Do you understand? 
Okay. 
You're involved in something that's much bigger than you can possibly imagine. 
So here's the deal. 
Unless you do exactly what I say... 
I will hurt Josh. 
If you don't believe that, you might want to consider this... 
Graem's death was not an accident. 
I killed him. 
I want you to say, "Thank you, Susan." 
Thank you, Susan. 
Now, you're not going to take Jack to the house where Graem met the Russians you're going to take him to a different address 9407 Hindry Place. 
You got it? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
Now, you do this for me, and I promise you, you will see Josh again. 
If you don't, he dies. 
Okay. 
9407 Hindry Place. 
Do the right thing, Marilyn. 
I already lost a son today. 
Don't make me lose a grandson. 
Good-bye, Susan. 
Are you all right? 
Fine. 
Here you go. 
Thank you. 
That was my office. 
A lot of the roads are still shut because of the bomb. 
Can we get home? 
No. And no one knows seems to 
know when they'll open up again. 
Then what do we do? 
We'll go to a hotel. 
We can stay there until they clear up. 
Marilyn, is any of this familiar? 
Yes. 
Jack? 
What? 
What is it? 
It's nothing. 
I thought I saw the house. 
But I was wrong. 
Oh, that was it. 
Hindry Place. 
Milo, we got a street. 
Hindry Place. 
Copy that, Jack. 
Relaying it to CTU now. 
How long before the new targets are reprogrammed? 
20 minutes. 
You still think you can trust the Arabs? 
They serve their purpose. 
Our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans. 
Today we will correct that mistake. 
And the Arabs will take all the blame. 
All right, we're on it. 
Chloe. 
Marilyn remembers the street where she believes her husband met with Gredenko. 
Hindry Place. 
That's a mile away from where they're looking. Is she sure? 
That's what she told Jack. 
Pull up all access roads in and out of the area. 
I'm in the middle of reconfiguring the uplink. 
I'll put Morris on it. 
Your call. 
I know you're lying to me. 
Just like my mom. 
You're all treating me like I'm just some stupid little kid. 
What are you talking about? 
I want to know why my dad died. 
What's your mother told you? 
It was a heart attack. 
I know, but... 
I know he was doing something illegal or whatever. 
But nobody's telling me what it was, and I just want to know. 
Did it have to do with the nuke? 
Look, Josh... 
you're gonna hear a lot of things about your father, what he may or may not have done. 
I'm not gonna pretend it's going to be easy for you. 
You know, no matter what... 
I'm gonna be there for you. 
That's it. The pale blue 
house on the right. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
We've got an address. 
9407 Hindry Place. 
Initiate tactical response with CTU. 
Have them bring up the schematics of the house. 
Meet me in the alley behind the target. 
All right, I'm on it. 
Hold on. 
We're going after the blue house. 
Advise your men, non-lethal force. 
We need Gredenko alive. 
Jack... 
Marilyn, I want you to stay in the tactical van. 
You'll be safe there. 
But, I have... 
Jack, I've got the schematics. 
There are two entrances. 
One in the front, one on the west side of the house. 
Okay, I'll contact CTU as soon as we've got Gredenko in custody. 
Milo, I want you to stay with Marilyn. 
Are your men ready? 
We're set. 
Let's go. 
All teams go. Go! 
Go! Go! 
Bomb! Everyone out! 
(loud explosion) Oh! 
Jack! 
We've gotta go! 
No! No! 
Get in the van! 
Get in the van and close the door! 
Jack? Jack, can you hear me? 
(automatic gunfire) (tires screeching) Oh, they're coming! 
Get out! Come on! Move! Move! 
(screams) Don't hit the woman! 
We need her alive! 
(gunshots blasting) Move! 
Move! Come on, come on! Move! 
Go, go, go! 
(grunting): All agents report in. 
All agents report in now. 
Calling in for EMT.
