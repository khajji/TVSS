I would like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere. 
The majority of your cabinet feels that you're making a tragic mistake. 
The man has murdered countless innocents, and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him. 
They will come after you. 
I assure you of that. 
We're talking about removing the President of the United States. 
We are in the middle of a national crisis, and he is in over his head. 
He has brought this on himself. 
I need the president's itinerary, specifically in regards to Assad's televised address. 
Why do you need this? 
The less you know, the better. 
Because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he was.s. 
CHLOE: You can't blame yourself. 
When the next bomb goes off, and thousands of more people die, everybody will remember that I was the one that made it possible. 
CTU found me. 
I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape. 
The delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high-priority targets. 
Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three. 
More than enough for our needs,Gredenko. 
Our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans. 
Today we will correct that mistake, and the Arabs will take all the blame. 
Marilyn, it is vital that we find this man Gredenko. 
If we retrace the route that you took that night, do you think that you would recognize the house? 
Maybe. 
What's going on with you and Jack? 
He's looking for someone he thinks I can help. 
You mean Gredenko? 
What do you know about him? 
I followed Graem to a house one night, he met with some Russians. 
Jack wants to take me over there to see if it can jog my memory. 
PHILLIP: Now you're not going to take Jack to the house where Graem met the Russians. 
You're going to take him to a different address. 
Now you do this for me, and I promise you you will see Josh again. 
If you don't, he dies. 
Marilyn, is any of this familiar? 
MARILYN: Yes. That's it. 
The pale blue house on the right. 
JACK: Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
Go! Go! 
Bomb! Everyone out! 
(automatic gunfire) Come on, move, move, move! 
Don't stop! 
(phone rings) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
BUCHANAN: What do you got? 
We've been ambushed. 
The house that Marilyn led us to was wired with explosives. 
Half my team is down I need you to send paramedics to 9407 Hendry Place. 
Bill, they knew we were coming. 
You mean Gredenko? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Right now I'm trying to find Milo and Marilyn. 
I think they're being pursued by hostiles. 
I'll have a team there in ten minutes. 
I'll monitor local bandwidth, see what I can come up with. 
Bill, hurry, we need to find them. 
(breathleMarilyn, come on, we've I-I can't...got to keep moving. 
You understand? 
Come on, move. 
Move! 
Check the warehouse. 
(labored breathing) REPORTER: The fallout has prevented emergency workers from coming within several miles (phone ringing) of ground zero, but survivors are being treated at local hospitals and makeshift medical facilities like the one behind me. 
Local authorities continue to urge people to stay in their home until further notice. 
Yeah? 
HACKER: We took out the CTU team. 
So is my son dead? 
Yes, sir. 
(sighing): Right, well... 
had to be done. 
You have Marilyn? 
No, sir, not yet. 
Why not yet? 
She escaped with someone from CTU, but we're tracking them now. 
Damn it, Hacker. 
We'll find her soon, sir. 
The man she's with doesn't look like a trained field agent. 
Make sure you take her alive. 
I need her to find Gredenko so I can end this mess. 
I understand, sir. 
I'll call you as soon as I have her. 
(clattering) Hey. 
They know we're here. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
Marilyn, listen to me. 
I'm going to cover you. 
When I do, I want you to head back towards the alley. 
I want you to run as fast and as far away from here as you can, you understand me? 
Okay. 
The targets are right behind us. 
Behind those Dumpsters. 
Remember... 
we need to take that woman alive. 
Just wait... 
wait till I tell you. 
Go! 
(screaming) I can't! 
(cries out) I told you to go! 
I couldn't! 
(groaning) Let's go. 
Wait! Wait! 
Kill him. 
(pained grunting) (gunshots, Marilyn screams) Drop your weapon! 
Let her go! 
Drop your weapon or I will kill her. 
If you wanted to kill her, she'd be dead by now. 
Now drop your weapon! 
Or I will use mine! 
Do it! 
On your knees! 
Now! Hands on your head! 
Interlace your fingers! 
Turn around and face the fence! 
Milo! 
Let me see it. 
(pained groaning) The bullet went through and through. 
There's no arterial bleeding. 
You're going to be okay. 
CTU will be here in a minute. 
Take this gun. 
Make sure he doesn't move. 
(whimpering) (screams) That call you took, that was from Gredenko. 
You tipped him off! 
Now over half my team is dead! 
You don't understand. 
What don't I understand? 
That Gredenko knew we were coming? 
It wasn't Gredenko on the phone. 
Those aren't his men. 
If those weren't Gredenko's men, whose were they? 
Who sent them? 
Your father. 
What are you talking about? 
It's true, Jack. 
I swear. 
Your father called me in the car. 
My father? 
He told me to lead you to that house. 
He said if I didn't... 
he said he'd killed Graem, and that if he had to, he would kill Josh. 
I'm sorry. 
He has my son. 
(sobbing) Marilyn. 
Do you have the address to Gredenko's safe house? 
(mouthing) I need you to give it to me now. 
I can't. 
I can't. 
Not until I have my son. 
I will help you get Josh back, but I need that address now. 
Gredenko is our only chance of recovering the nuclear weapons. 
You saw what happened in Valencia earlier today. 
This is going to be worse. 
Please. 
Just give me the address. 
I recognized the house once we were driving. 
It's on Glascoe-- 9421. 
Don't move. 
(phone rings) Buchanan. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
I've got the correct address for Gredenko's safe house. 
9421 Glascoe. 
Turner's team will be there any minute. 
You run point on this. 
No, I want you to send me a smaller team to my location. 
I'm at an industrial park on Pine, just south of Oxford. 
Make sure the team brings me a vehicle with a full tactical kit. 
Then they're gngng to have to transfer Milo back to CTU. 
He's been shot, but he's not critical. 
I want you to divert the rest of the team to the address on Glascoe have them initiate the attack. 
Get back to me as soon as soon you've got Gredenko in custody. 
Jack, what's going on? 
I'll explain everything later. 
That's not good enough. 
Bill, please. 
Just trust me. 
This is personal. 
Jack! 
Hi. 
Hey. 
Did you finish the vectors? 
No. 
You know, if you're having trouble, I can help you. 
I'm not having trouble. 
I'm just not finished, and I don't want this to turn into another conversation about whether or not I'm okay. 
I'm sorry, love. 
It's all right, but if you can't talk to me, then you should talk to a staff psychologist or your sponsor. 
I don't need a shrink. 
I don't want to talk to my sponsor, I'll be fine. 
We just heard from Jack. 
Marilyn Bauer's safe, and she gave us Gredenko's location. 
Milo was shot during the operation, but he's going to be okay. 
What happened? 
He held off three armed hostiles until Jack could get there. 
From what I understand, he's going to be up for a commendation. 
Morris, when Milo gets here, I want you to debrief him as soon as medical gives you the okay. 
Yeah, yeah, I'll debrief him, and thanks for rubbing that salt in the wounds. 
What are you talking about? 
The nukes are armed because I'm a coward, and now you want me to listen to Milo talk about what a bloody hero he is. Agh! 
Coincidence? 
It'll be taken care of, thanks. 
Taken care of. 
We're coordinating the Gredenko operation from here. 
Tac teams are moving in on his location. 
I'll be right there. 
Obviously I pushed you back to work too soon. 
I'll have someone from district relieve you. 
No, no, that would just make me feel worse. 
Look, I need a few minutes I'll be fine. 
I'm going to take a walk. 
I'll cover for you, but you need to be back here before we launch. 
Yeah, I will. 
Give me the phone; we need to make the call. 
Scramble collar has to be enabled. 
(indistinct communication over police radio) (beeping) (distant siren blaring) Give us a second, please. 
Does he know where Phillip is holding Josh? 
No. 
I'm gonna have to force my father's hand. 
Meaning what? 
He's gonna call my father, tell him he's apprehended you, but that you won't give him Gredenko's location until he takes you to see your son. 
What if Phillip refuses? 
Then you have to stay firm. 
Tell him it's not a negotiation, no matter what he threatens. 
Jack, you're asking me to put Josh's life at risk. 
Josh's life is at risk. 
Trust me, my father is not going to give away his location unless he thinks he has to. 
Is that what this is about finding Phillip? 
Josh is secondary? 
My father will have Josh with him. 
Marilyn, I will do everything in my power to make sure your son is safe. 
How do you know he won't betray us? 
He wants to live. 
Let's go. 
You don't want to watch this. 
You know, Josh... 
your father was very proud of you. 
He used to tell me how blessed he felt knowing everything that he was working so hard to build would be left in such good hands. 
Do we really have to talk about this right now, Grandpa? 
No... of course not. 
He loved you very much. 
Remember, I'll be able to hear both sides of this conversation. 
You're set. 
Dial. 
(phone speed-dialing) (phone rings) Do you have her? 
Yeah... but we 
took casualties. 
I'm on my own now. 
Are you assembling another team to take out Gredenko? 
Yeah, I am, but she's refusing to tell me where Gredenko is until she sees her son. 
Put her on. 
I did what you asked, now where's Josh? 
Marilyn, look, I know you're frightened, but this doesn't have to end badly. 
If you help me find Gredenko, we can all survive this, as a family. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
I just want my son. 
I'm just saying, you made your deal with Graem. 
Now make a deal with me. 
With enough time, you and I... and Josh 
can rebuild whatever is left of this family. 
After all, the legacy I'm trying to preserve will someday be his. 
We can do this. 
But first, you have to tell me where Gredenko is. 
Only after this man takes me to see my son. 
Bringing you here will only complicate things, and I need Gredenko now. 
Tell me where he is. 
No. 
You may have misunderstood my offer as a sign of weakness, so let me make it perfectly clear. 
If you do not help me, I see no future for you or Josh. 
I will walk into the next room, and I will kill him. 
Right now. 
Tell me... or Josh dies. 
I will not tell you what you want to know until I have my son. 
Give him back the phone. 
(sobbing) Yeah? 
Bring her to me at the Grandmont Hotel. 
Room 2132. 
We're on our way. 
We got the address. 
You did great. 
Cuff him, put him in the back. 
(sniffles) (handcuffs clicking) Josh? 
Uh, I'm just gonna go downstairs to get a soda. 
Did you want anything? 
No, thanks. 
Did you look in the minibar? 
Uh, yeah, but there really wasn't anything that I wanted. 
Why don't you call room service? 
Well, I just feel like getting out. 
Josh... 
Don't even think about it. 
No one's life is worth the destruction of everything I've built. 
Now step away from the door. 
I was beginning to worry. 
Meeting went long. 
Here's the President's itinerary. 
Oh, good. 
This will work. 
So when... 
when does all this happen? 
Now. 
I need you to authorize clearance for someone to get inside the bunker. 
Once he's inside, he'll carry the ball. 
"Carry the ball"? 
You mean, kill the President. 
Sir, I would like to think that we are beyond the point of second-guessing ourselves. 
This President has endangered the lives of millions of people. 
You do not need to tell me what the stakes are here. 
So who is this person we're putting inside? 
He's a security specialist, private sector, but I've already put in a request for him to advise my group on civil response options. 
He has level two clearance; I just need you upgrade him. 
They will trace this thing right back to me. 
No. You won't even 
be investigated. 
We have a cover. 
A cover? Who? 
Assad. 
Assad? 
You're trying to make it look like he did this? 
Sir, all you need to do is call in your authorization code. 
(phone ringing) That's all the information you need on him. 
Yeah, Dan. 
Mr. Lennox, the President 
has asked to see you. 
Okay, tell the President I will be with him in a moment. 
Sir, our man will be here within the hour. 
Call me when you're done with the President. 
Tom, come in. 
You asked to see me, sir? 
Yes, I'd like to hear your thoughts about something. 
My thoughts on what, sir? 
Assad's speech. 
He's going live in less than one hour, and before I give him my thoughts, I wanted to hear yours. 
Is there a problem? 
Uh, no, sir, it's just... 
What? 
I assumed you were no longer interested in my opinion, sir. 
Tom, I still value your judgment, and if I've made you feel otherwise, I apologize. 
All right, sir. 
How much longer? 
I'm not sure. 
I have to recalculate the profile for two of the target cities. 
Hurry. 
I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary. 
You think the authorities know we're working with Fayed? 
If they don't, they will soon. 
WOMAN (harried): I was in my kitchen when I saw the flash. 
I turned to look out my window, and it just exploded, all the windows. 
There was glass everywhere. 
And then there was this sound. 
It was so loud. 
Oh, man. 
Hell of a day, huh? 
Yeah, you could say that. 
Can I get you anything else? 
No. 
Yeah. 
Whiskey. Plain, single malt. 
What kind? 
That kind. 
This? 
Yeah. 
And these. 
Okay. 
(register drawer opening) Your change? 
Keep it. 
(grunts) (sobbing) (retching) (phone rings) MORRIS: I'm on my way. 
From where? 
I told you, I went out for a walk. 
The Tac Team is about to move in on Gredenko. 
I need you at your station. 
I'm on my way. 
Morris... 
(sobbing) Come with me. 
I want you to put this on, under your clothes. 
It's just a precaution. 
(frustrated grunt) My hands are shaking. 
Here. 
I'm going to do everything I can to get him back. 
He's the only reason I stayed with Graem... 
He was the only good thing I had left since... 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Get out. 
(grunts) You do exactly what I tell you. 
You understand me? 
Hey, Milo? 
Hey. 
How are you holding up? 
(groans)... They say 
I'm going to be okay. 
(sighs) It's... 
So what happened? 
I was stupid. 
They don't pay me to be a field agent. 
Well, maybe they should, because, uh... 
you protected Marilyn Bauer. 
That's what I heard. 
I had no idea what I was doing. 
The whole thing just happened so fast. 
You don't have to downplay it to make me fell better. 
You don't have to do that. 
Okay. 
Uh... 
Hey. 
You okay? 
Yeah. 
Well done. 
Thanks. 
I'm going to push Assad to make these changes. 
Your suggestions are all excellent, Tom. 
Oh? Just doing my job, 
Mr. President. 
I'd like you to be there when he delivers this. 
I will be, sir. 
If you'll excuse me, I have a briefing with Senator Benson. 
Of course, Tom. 
(phone beeps) Melinda? 
I have some notes that need to be taken to Assad. 
MELINDA (over intercom): Yes, Mr. President. 
(quietly): What did the president want? 
He asked me to review Assad's speech. 
Which he'll never get the chance to deliver. 
Listen, sir... you need 
to authorize that clearance. 
Our man will be here any minute. 
It's in the works. 
It's just taking a while to complete the authorization. 
All right, well, we need it before he's here. 
I will call security again. 
I will phone you back if there's any problem. 
Meanwhile, go meet with him. 
This is Tom Lennox. 
I need to speak to the ranking Secret Service agent on site. 
MAN (over phone): Agent Hollister. 
Agent Hollister, this is Tom Lennox. 
I need to see you immediately. 
Yes, sir. 
I can meet you as soon as I get someone to man my position, which should be in about 15 minutes. 
No, that's not soon enough. 
I've got something to show you. 
Where are you right now? 
"B" Wing, room 17. 
I'm on my way. 
(groans) Carson wondered if you were playing us. 
He said that he didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you! 
I said that we could trust you. 
I told him that you understood. 
Nothing justifies the killing of a president. 
This president is giving us no choice. 
Don't do this. 
(grunting): It's already done. 
(panting) Yes, uh, this is Reed Pollock. 
I have a message for Agent Hollister from Mr. Lennox. 
Yes. Could you please tell him 
that the issue has been resolved and that Mr. Lennox won't need 
to meet with him. 
MAN (over phone): Yes, sir. 
Okay. Thanks. 
NADIA: We just confirmed Marilyn Bauer's intel. 
The Glasgow house is owned by a Russian shell corporation that Gredenko has a hidden interest in. 
Is Turner's team in place? 
They'll let me know when they're ready to go. 
Chloe, lock satellite and establish a comm link. 
Nadia. 
(quietly): Where were you? I told you 
not to take too long. 
Sorry. 
Comm unit's operational, but the backup module needs to be reset. 
You better go do it now; the operation starts in two minutes. 
(quietly): Come with me. 
Do you realize that after everything we've been through what a betrayal this is? 
I was a little late. 
Morris, I can smell it on your breath. 
Yes... I took a drink, 
but I spat it out straight away. 
Please... 
I swear. 
Chloe, look at me. 
Look at me. 
I am stone-cold sober. 
You're losing control. 
You're placing other people's lives in danger. 
(sighs) I'm going to have to tell Buchanan. 
After everything that has happened... 
(chuckles)... 
something had to give. 
The important thing is, that I realized I didn't want to throw everything away, especially you, especially you. 
And I stopped myself, and that is a little victory. 
Right? 
I swear, it will never happen again. 
Please don't tell Buchanan because you're right me getting back to work is the best medicine. 
I'll be watching you for the rest of the shift. 
Fine. 
Call your sponsor. 
I will. 
Turner's team is taking final positions. 
Chloe, open the video link. 
Hal, what's your status? 
No sign of a lookout. 
Windows are covered, but we're good to go. 
Commence at your discretion. 
Ryan, is your team ready? 
Yes, sir. 
Okay, we're going in on three, two, one. 
Clear! 
Clear! 
Clear! 
Clear! 
First sweep, all clear, sir. 
Roger that. 
TURNER (over link): Mr. Buchanan, there no sign 
of Gredenko or anyone. 
Hal, as soon as you've completed a full sweep, process the place for evidence. 
Yes, sir. 
Chloe, text Jack's cell phone, tell him we don't have Gredenko. 
(panting) (phone vibrating) Hold up here. 
What's wrong? 
It's nothing. 
Don't even think about trying to warn my father. 
Once he sees that you brought me here, he's more likely to shoot you than I am. 
Do you understand me? 
Yeah. 
Both of you go up to the door. 
You knock; when he let's you in, I'll follow. 
Let's go. 
Marilyn, get back. 
Open the door. 
Now, go. 
Where the hell is my father? 
I don't know, I swear. 
Where's Josh? 
Marilyn, just stay calm. 
Put these on. 
(phone rings) Answer it; put it on speaker. 
Hello? 
PHILLIP: Hello, Marilyn. 
Jack, even when you were young, I learned never to underestimate you. 
I didn't want to hurt Josh. 
You've forced my hand. 
Take a look out the window, the adjacent roof. 
(gasps) Oh, Phillip, please don't! 
JACK: Dad... 
you only have one play left here, that's to try and cut a deal with the government. 
Explain your connection to the nuke; tell them you'll try and help them in exchange for immunity. 
Right now that is your only option. 
You pull that trigger and that option is gone. 
Do you understand me? Gone. 
I'm no fool, Jack. 
They're never going to give me immunity after everything I've done. 
You don't know that. 
You don't know that for sure! 
Right now they are desperate. 
But either way, for you, this is over. 
Dad, it's over! 
There is no empire to protect. 
There's no legacy left. 
There is Marilyn, Josh and me; that's it. 
Please, Dad. 
I know you don't want to hurt Josh. 
I'm the one you want. 
You let Josh go... 
I will surrender. 
Come alone, unarmed, and I'll let Josh go. 
But if you bring anyone else into this, I will kill him. 
I understand. 
Hang up the phone. 
(speed dialing) WOMAN (over phone): CTU. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
I need you to send a team over to the Grandmont Hotel to pick up a hostile. 
He's been secured. 
He's in room 2132. 
Jack? 
Hey, I need to talk to you. 
About what? 
Morris. 
Not here. 
Look, he came and saw me in the infirmary... 
Look, I know he's been a little shaky. 
Has he been drinking? 
You smelled it on his breath? 
Yeah. 
I did, too. 
I already talked to him about it. 
He didn't metabolize the alcohol. 
He didn't metabolize the alcohol? 
I know it sounds weird, but it's true. 
He took a drink and he spit it back out. 
How do you know? 
Because he told me. 
And you believe him? 
I don't have to believe him. 
I was married to him-- if he was drunk, I would know. 
He's not drunk. 
He's been sober for three years. 
I didn't know he was an alcoholic. 
Now you know. 
And you don't think Buchanan should know about this? 
No. If he slips up again, 
I will personally tell Buchanan. 
Let's just leave it for now. 
Okay. 
Okay. I want you to wait here 
for Josh. 
Do you think your father will keep his word? 
As long as I keep mine. 
You know how to use this? 
Point and shoot. 
Once I get Josh, do you want me to call CTU and tell them to send help? 
No. 
I need to take care of this myself. 
Jack... 
thank you. 
Everything's going to be all right. 
Just wait here. 
I'm unarmed! 
Dad! 
I'm unarmed! 
Come out! I am unarmed! 
PHILLIP: That's close enough. 
Turn around. 
Now show me that you're not wearing an ankle holster. 
Take one step toward me for every step Josh takes away. 
Josh. 
Slowly. 
Your mother's waiting for you in the stairwell around the corner. Go. Go! 
That's it. 
Oh, Josh! 
Oh, God... 
Are you okay? 
Are you okay? 
Let's go. 
Go. 
I never meant for this to happen, Jack. 
I didn't have a choice. 
I don't know how exactly, but Gredenko found out about my role in David Palmer's assassination. 
So... he blackmailed me, 
forced me to cooperate. 
So it was Gredenko who had you divert some of the bombs the company was responsible for destroying? 
He's a radical nationalist. 
Told me that he wanted to preserve some of the arsenal for the day when the Soviet Union would be reestablished. 
I believed him because I had to. 
When did you find out he sold the bombs to Fayed? 
Not until one of the bombs was detonated in Valencia. 
That's the truth?! 
Absolutely. 
I've been looking for Gredenko ever since. 
So that I could find out what he knew about Fayed, and stop all this. 
I'm a patriot, Jack. 
I never wanted any harm to come to this country. 
You want to lie to yourself, you go ahead, but stop lying to me! 
You let all of this happen just so you could cover up what you did! 
(wry chuckle) You have all the smarts that Graem never had. 
You'd have handled Gredenko before this all got out of control. 
You know, none of this would have happened if you hadn't turned your back on me. 
So that you could become what? 
a civil servant. 
So... 
your people will use Gredenko to find this terrorist, and the truth will come out about all I've done. 
We never got Gredenko. 
Then all this was for nothing. 
On your knees. 
I didn't have to end like this, Jack. 
(gun chamber clicks) You could've had it all. 
I want you to know... 
...I never wanted you to feel 
like I had turned my back on you. 
That I had turned my back on the family. 
I just had to go my own way. 
Do things for myself. I... 
It was never good enough for you. 
I'm sorry. 
Anyway... 
I'm ready. 
What are you waiting for? 
Do it! 
Damn you! 
(phone rings) Yes? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
Who am I talking to? 
You must've exhausted all your options to find Gredenko. 
Who is this? 
It's Charles Logan, Jack. 
I might be able to help you, but we need to talk face-to-face. 
Where are you? 
I'm near the airport. 
Good, you're local. 
CTU knows where I am. 
Come and see me, Jack, as soon as possible And come alone. 
I'm looking forward to it.
