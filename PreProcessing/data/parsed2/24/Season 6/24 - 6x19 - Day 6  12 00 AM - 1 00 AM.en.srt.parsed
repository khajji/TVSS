This is Bauer. 
Let me speak to Audrey. 
Her well-being's entirely up yo you, Mr. Bauer 
What we want is a component from the triggering mechanism the FB sub circuit board You give me the component I give you Audrey DOYLE: Stand down, Jack! 
I can't do that. 
I won't say it again. Drop it! 
Agent Doyle, I am following orders that exceed you're security clearance... 
He's a rogue agent. 
Take him out. 
It's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defense codes. 
JACK: I need the Chinese to believe that I'm willing to go through with this exchange. 
I will destroy the circuit board with a concealed charge of C-4. 
You're going to sacrifice yourself? 
Yes, sir, if I have to. 
You're asking me to sign off on a probable suicide mission. 
Mr. President... 
you owe me. 
JACK: I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards. 
CHLOE: I'm sending it to your system. 
The Russians have been trying to keep that technology out of Chinese hands for years. 
I did it for Jack. 
Well, what are the Russians going to say when they find out we just gave it to them? 
Well, it's not going to get that far. 
You have to tell Buchanan. 
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this operation. 
You've shown me I can't trust you. 
First I want to say that I'm grateful to report that all nuclear devices have been recovered. 
Based on the intelligence that I've seen, I can say with full confidence that-that-that that we will, uh... 
(groans) Get medical right away! 
Notify the Senate and the House of the transfer of power and the Sec Def and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs authorize me under the 25th Amendment. 
Wayne Palmer just issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand classified Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage. 
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese. 
Even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome. 
Tell CTU to stop Bauer. 
CTU has the signal. 
They're monitoring the device. 
We're set. Let's go. 
(phone ringing) Doyle. 
BUCHANAN: Noah Daniels is acting president. 
He wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU immediately. 
Understood. 
Don't you move. 
Jack... 
Slowly I want you to pull over. 
Now. 
This is going to end badly, Jack. 
You can't go against the White House. 
Wait! Wait! 
Stop! Stop! 
(horn honking) Stop! Stop! 
(tires screeching) Wait! Wait! Stop your car! Stop! 
Stop! 
Stop! Stop! 
What the hell?! 
Are you crazy?! 
I'm a federal agent in pursuit. 
I need the vehicle. 
Where's your badge? 
(horns honking) (tires screeching) (phone ringing) Pressman. 
Milo, it's Doyle. 
I need to speak with Buchanan. 
Hold on. 
Sir, Doyle's on line one. 
Mike, it's Bill. 
Do you have Jack in custody? 
No, he got the drop on me before I could get the component-- I screwed up. 
Where are you? 
I acquired another vehicle and I'm in pursuit. 
Morris, do you have Jack's position? 
Yeah. 
The tracker's still embedded in the sub-board. 
He's heading north on the 118. 
Copy that. 
Mike, Jack's going to disengage that tracker the first chance he gets. 
I'll get him before he does. 
All right, listen up. 
Jack Bauer has gone rogue. 
He has in possession the FB sub-circuit board. 
Mike Doyle is in pursuit. 
He needs all available resources to stop Jack and recover the component before he gives it to the Chinese. 
Chloe. 
I need you on task. 
You said that... 
I know what I said. 
I need my best people looking for Jack. 
Can I trust you to help me do that? 
Yes, sir. 
Good. Thank you. 
MORRIS: Oh, that's bloody marvelous. 
What? 
I just lost Jack's signal. 
How'd you do that? 
I didn't do anything. 
It just disappeared. 
(electrical wires crackling) CHLOE: There must be something in the transit ph. 
You don't have to state the obvious, Chloe. 
I know there's something interfering, I'm  trying to figure out what it is. 
CHLOE: This doesn't have to be personal. 
Can we just figure it out? 
It's not personal, and I've figured it out. 
This stretch of road runs right along the main voltage feed for the Valley, and Jack is using the power lines as a shield while he separates the tracker from the sub-board. 
Can you keep an eye on things? Can you? 
I have to explain this to Buchanan. 
Hey, I thought you got sidelined. 
Buchanan wants me to help find Jack. 
Which is going to be harder now that he's dumped the tracker. 
Did you pull up Caltrans? 
Yeah. 
I just can't believe that Jack would give up the circuit board to the Chinese. 
Jack would die before he gives up that component to the Chinese. 
I agree with you. 
The question is... would Jack 
give up Audrey's life? 
Exactly. 
Look, I'll... 
I'll check the satellites. 
See if they've restored any coverage in that area. 
If you find anything, send it to me, Doyle and LAPD. 
How much farther? 
We lost Jack eight miles north of your current location. 
We think he used the power lines as a shield while he removed the tracker. 
You're headed in the right direction. 
See you if you can pick up a trail. 
I'll call you back when I get closer. 
Thank you, Morris. 
All right. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief statement and I will not be taking any questions at this time. 
The President is en route to Bethesda Naval Hospital and will arrive shortly. 
The doctors have no idea whether or not President Palmer will come out of his coma in hours, days or weeks. 
Vice President Daniels will be addressing the country at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. 
Thank you. 
That's all, everyone. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
Tom... 
Yes, sir. 
Stick around. 
I want to talk to you. 
All right, sir. 
We need to clear the air, you and I. 
You still have evidence that could hurt me, and I'd like to know what your intentions are. 
Truthfully, sir, I haven't given it much thought. 
Why don't you think about it now. 
All right, sir. 
It concerns me that you engaged in conspiracy and perjury to achieve political ends. 
I don't think that's behavior befitting the acting president of the United States. 
Tom, the world has changed in the last half hour. 
Right now, this country, above all, needs stability. 
If I'm brought up on charges in the first hours of this presidency, then America's left without elected leadership. 
If I might just complete my thought, sir I made that tape both to back you off your challenge to President Palmer, but also to protect me. 
Now that was, and remains, my only reason. 
What about forcing my resignation? 
That was Wayne Palmer's idea, not mine. 
So... 
you're okay then with me in this chair? 
Sir, it's no secret that policy-wise you and I are in alignment. 
I just simply hate how we got here. 
Now that we are here? 
Yes, sir, you have my support. 
(sighs) In the event that we ever get out of alignment... 
I can't have you holding this evidence over my head. 
It's understood, sir. 
You have my word. 
All right, Tom. 
Glad to have you with me. 
Now what do you suggest we do with Karen Hayes? 
Will she slow us down? 
Of course she might, but she is smart, she brings balance. 
Fine, then she stays. 
Right. May I let her know, sir? 
Sure. 
Tom. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, sir. 
(phone ringing) Yes. 
This is Bauer. I just passed 
mile marker 49. 
I have the sub-circuit board with me. 
Good. Go east on 
the 118... 
No, from this point forward we do this my way. 
Don't test me, Mr. Bauer. 
Yes, I want the component, but Audrey Raines' life means nothing to me. 
Listen to me. 
CTU is looking for me. 
They want to stop the exchange from happening. 
I know their satellite coverage. 
I need to pick the location. 
All right. 
Where? 
There's an abandoned motel called the Calderone off of Highway 305. 
Come through the front door alone. 
We'll make the exchange there. 
We both have a chance to get what we want here, Mr. Bauer. 
Don't attempt anything foolish. 
We're leaving now, Ms. Raines. 
(speaking Chinese) I spoke with Bill, and he assures me that CTU has deployed all its resources to find Bauer. 
I don't want to hear about their assurances, Karen. 
They let Bauer steal the component, so their assurances mean nothing. 
Well, if I may, sir. 
I could authorize ancillary agencies to join the search. 
That would increase our chances of finding Bauer. 
Do it. 
Is there anything else you need from me? 
Is there anything else I need from you? 
Let me think. 
(sighs) I have the fate of the Western world and the lives of millions of Americans hanging in the balance and I can't... 
stop thinking about you. 
I'm not sure this is appropriate behavior, Mr. Acting President. 
Well, there's the phone, call to the media. 
Tell them the acting president's a dirty old man. 
They already know. 
I would like for you... 
to spend what's left of the night. 
I'll go home and pick up a change of clothes. 
Good. 
I'm at the Tampa exit by the power lines. 
It matches the last coordinates Morris had before the tracker stopped working. 
Mike, it's Bill. 
The White House is telling me if the Chinese get ahold of this sub-circuit board, we'll have an international incident on our hands. 
I know the stakes, Bill. 
Have you been able to figure out where Jack's headed? 
I'm working on it now. 
It looks like he headed east. 
What's up ahead? 
Two state routes, the 305 and the 98. 
Do you have satellite on both? 
No. The radiation 
from the fallout made that area hard to cover. 
But the 98 has Caltrans cameras I can check them. 
No, don't bother. 
Jack would know about those-- he's on the 305. 
And check the cell towers in the area. 
See if you can pick up a phone call between Jack and Cheng. 
And I think I saw Jack pick up one of the terrorist's phones at the warehouse-- that might help narrow things down. 
Chloe's got that grid on her system-- get it from her. 
Who's that? 
Doyle. He thinks 
Jack's on the 305. 
How would he know that? 
He figured it out. 
Chloe, I need you to pull the logs on grid 19-dash-12. 
Get everything off that cell tower for the last 15 minutes. 
What am I looking for? 
I think Jack's using one of the terrorist's phones that were tagged at the warehouse. 
Check all outgoing calls. 
We'll get it. 
Oh, um... 
what is this? 
Those are today's decryption schemes from the cell towers. 
I'm sending you some scrambled calls. 
We're looking for a conversation between Jack and Cheng. 
Why didn't you speak to me first before over-writing my screen? 
I don't know, that's just the way I did it. 
Okay, okay. We're being 
a little hostile, aren't we? 
Fine. 
I'm hostile, but I just didn't get there you pushed me halfway. 
Actually, you're right it's my fault, all my fault. 
I didn't say it's all your fault. 
I said halfway, 50%, point-five-- see, you don't listen to me. 
That's why I just sent it to your screen. 
Hey, guys. 
What's going on? 
My ex-wife is suddenly showing signs of irrational behavior. 
Okay. 
Do you know how to defrag Huffman keys? 
Yeah. Why? 
Can you help me out with this? 
Yeah. 
Great. I'll just send 
the files to your system. 
That's a really good idea. 
You should work with Milo you know, get cozy. 
Would you please stop acting like this? 
I really hate it. 
Why don't you write down the way you want me to act, put it in a file, tab delimited, the Milo loves it, and... 
shove it. 
Okay. I'll write it down 
the first item on the list would be: "Don't be such a jealous jerk." 
Okay. Um, the day I'm jealous 
is the day I kill myself. 
Is there anything else? 
How about: "Don't arm nuclear bombs for terrorists"? 
(exhales) Sorry. I didn't mean that. 
That's not how I feel. 
Yeah, it is. 
No, it's not. 
It just slipped out of my mouth. 
Morris... 
I'll call Mel over at the FBI, get them to share resources with Bill. 
(phone rings) Good, and I'll... Oh. 
Excuse me. 
Yeah? 
Okay. 
Well, tell him I'll be right there. 
That's strange. 
Peter Hock is in my office, and he wants to talk to me. 
Department of Justice? 
What is that about? 
I have no idea. 
Be careful, Karen. 
He's got a lot of clout on the Hill. 
I know. I'll call you. 
Peter. 
Early enough for you? 
(laughs) So, what's going on? 
It sounded urgent. 
You know that I've been interrogating Tom's chief of staff, Reed Pollock, after his arrest. 
That must be pleasant. 
(chuckles) Pollock's looking at a probable death sentence for his part in the assassination attempt on Wayne Palmer. 
Mm-hmm. 
Out of desperation, he's offering up everything he knows, hoping we'll show some leniency. 
And what does that have to do with me? 
Not just you, this involves your husband as well. 
Take a look. 
Listen to me, Peter. 
You and I both know that there are going to be endless hearings looking into how Fayedmanaged to acquire the nukes. 
PETER: And you know something about that? 
I can give you key information that will help keep blame away from this administration. 
PETER: I'm listening. 
POLLOCK: Well, I'm not saying anything until I have some sort of deal, in writing. 
He's such a weasel. 
We, uh, danced around for 20 minutes, then he... 
said this. 
I'm telling you... 
exactly what happened. 
Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody, and he let him go. 
PETER: And where's the proof? 
POLLOCK: Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland. 
That's a cover-up. 
And if you don't believe me, I have recorded conversations with Peter Iannone, Kurt Hueig and Myra Mawk, and they will all testify that she sequestered the file to protect her husband. 
Do me a favor, Karen. 
Save me some time. 
Is it true or not? 
The facts are true. 
But there's no cover-up here, Peter. 
About two years ago, we apprehended Fayed as part of an FBI-CTU border sweep. 
There wasn't enough to hold him, he was one of many, and he was maybe a mid-level player. 
And that turned out to be wrong. 
Fayed wasn't part of a cell; he wasn't funded. 
This all happened after he was released. 
So why was it blue-coded? 
Every year, thousands of suspects are arrested. 
If there isn't enough evidence to hold them, they're released and blue-coded-- that's just standard procedure. 
The only way to guarantee that no one becomes a threat is to hold everyone and deprive them of their rights and freedom. 
All right, Karen, then if this was a no-fault, why did this carry so much weight with you 12 hours ago. 
Why did you resign rather than have this come out? 
Come on, Peter, we were under attack. 
There was no way I was gonna let this information touch the president or my husband. 
They needed to lead us through this crisis unimpeded. 
Well, here we are, 12 hours later, Palmer's in a coma, the country's in shock after losing over 13,000 innocent lives, and all people are going to be asking is who let this happen? 
Well, certainly not my husband. 
He has devoted his life to this country. 
This isn't my call, Karen, but I think you know how this works. 
Someone's going to have to go down. 
And the farther from the president the better. 
So what exactly are you saying? 
It's going to be either you or Bill. 
Bill would be my preference he's lower on the food chain. 
But you'll do. 
(phone rings) Doyle. 
NADIA: We found Jack's call to Cheng. 
What'd he say? 
We haven't decrypted it yet, but the triangulation shows he's traveling north on the 305 just like you thought. 
Anything between me and Santa Maria? 
Uh, some small populated areas in the county, unincorporated. 
When does the next one come up? 
About nine miles from where you are now. 
All right, check it out, and keep working on that decryption. 
I want to know what Cheng and Jack said to each other. 
Okay. 
Are we converging on Jack? 
(phone rings) Yeah. Doyle's... 
Excuse me. Hi. 
KAREN: Hi. It's me. 
Do you have a minute? 
No. We're closing in on Jack. 
What is it? 
We have to talk about something. 
Why don't you call me when you have a few minutes. 
Okay. Everything all right? 
Just... do what you have to do 
and call me when you can, okay? 
All right. 
Bye. 
Yes? 
Well, Doyle's headed in the right direction. 
He can't be that far behind. 
We may have a chance to stop Jack before he reaches Cheng. 
He's traveling north on the 305. 
About there. 
Hey, let me call you back. 
Has CTU made any progress in locating Bauer? 
They're closing in, but they don't have him in custody yet. 
You were right about Hock, Tom. 
I need to talk to you. 
All right, shoot. 
Remember earlier when you threatened to use that information about Fayed to damage Bill and me? 
Karen, yeah, mea culpa. 
Wh-Why are we dredging this up now? 
No, no. 
Tom, it's not me. 
It's Reed Pollock. 
He's looking for anything to bargain his way out of the death penalty. 
Well, he can't. 
Well, whether he can or he can't, that ship has sailed. 
Hock knows now that we released Fayed from our custody two years ago in Seattle. 
Okay, okay. 
What does Hock want? 
Distance from the presidency. 
Ah, so in other words, either you or Bill has to take the blame. 
Yeah. But it's more 
than blame, Tom. 
There's gonna be inquiries, indictments, investigations lives will be ruined. 
Not lives, careers. 
Or rather, one career. 
And it can't be yours. 
Well, I can't do that to Bill, Tom. 
He's my husband. 
Well, he can go on being your husband, but he sure can't keep running CTU. 
(sighs) Well, if he goes, then I'm gonna resign. 
Haven't you already resigned once today? 
Karen, that's Bill's signature on Fayed's release document. 
Now, it's over for Bill. 
It's not for you-- I mean, you've got a job here. 
Just do it. 
(sighs) Tom, how can I ask him to step down? 
You don't ask you simply remind him that the man he personally let out of jail killed over 13,000 people this morning. 
Tom, he is not responsible for that. 
Karen, it doesn't matter. 
He has been amazing today! 
Look, look, look, the only way for you to protect yourself is to leave no doubt in anybody's mind where your true loyalty lies. 
Now, they got Bill in the crosshairs, okay? 
You want to stand shoulder to should with your husband, that's your call. 
(sighs) (sighs) (ringing) This is Bill Buchanan. 
If your matter is urgent, please dial zero. 
If this is not an urgent call, please leave a message at the beep. 
(beep) Bill, it's Jack. 
I'm about to meet with Cheng and exchange the FB sub-circuit board for Audrey. 
Hopefully, by the time you hear this, she'll be safe and in your custody. 
Bill, I know I promised the president that I would give him confirmation that the circuit board did not fall into the wrong hands. 
This message is your confirmation. 
The circuit board will be incinerated in the explosion. 
The meeting will take place at the Calderone Motel off of Highway 305. 
Bill... 
Please take care of Audrey. 
And thank you. 
You've been a good friend All right, Marcy. I'll talk 
to you in the morning. 
Yeah. 
You have a second? 
What is it, Morris? 
I'd like to request a transfer. 
Why? 
I need to get out of Comm. 
You want to elaborate on that? 
Not really, no. 
You and Chloe having problems? 
You could say that, yes. 
I really hate to lose you in Comm. 
Can we talk about this in the morning? 
Nothing's gonna change. 
You don't know that, Miles. 
I do. 
Look. Please. 
Figure out where you want to put me. 
Anywhere is fine. 
Just get me out of Comm. 
All right. 
We'll work something out that, uh, that's good for everyone involved. 
Thank you. 
(phone ringing) Hi, honey. 
Hey. 
I have a minute. 
Did you want to talk about something? 
Bill, the DOJ investigator found out about Seattle, when you and Homeland had Fayed in custody. 
"Found out"? 
It wasn't a secret. 
We did everything by the book. 
I can deal with DOJ. 
Yeah, I know, but... 
The problem is, they're out for blood, Bill. 
I can't let this touch me. 
Touch you? What are 
you talking about? 
Bill, I... 
Why is this suddenly an issue? 
Are you concerned I might implicate you? 
No. No, but obviously there's 
guilt by association here. 
They're looking for a scapegoat. 
Yes. The pundits and 
the press are looking for anything to attack the administration. 
What are you saying? 
I have to protect the White House, Bill. 
and in order to do that, I have to distance myself from you. 
How are you going to do that? 
I'm your husband. 
You asking me to resign? 
No, Bill. 
I have to fire you. 
There's pressure on you, Karen. 
Look, this is the only way this can work. 
And it has to happen immediately. 
or I'll be viewed as complicit and my ability to stay on as national security advisor will be undermined. 
Undermined? 
We're talking about the end of my career. 
You don't think that I've thought this through? 
No, I don't. 
You don't think that I don't know what this means to you? 
No, I don't. 
Bill... 
Because the public will make assumptions that don't exist. 
13,000 American lives lost. 
I had the man in custody who was responsible, and I released him. 
It won't matter that I had no evidence to hold him. 
Look, you know how this works. 
One of us has to take the fall, and it can't be me. 
I'm too close to the president. 
I can't believe I'm hearing this. 
Who is pressuring you, Karen? 
What are you not saying? 
You have to trust me on this, honey. 
We will get through this, I promise. 
And... I love you, and that's 
all that should matter here. 
Is it? 
Yes. 
(phone ringing) (hangs up) Why is it taking so long with Jack's phone call to Cheng? 
It just is, Mike. 
He used a double-length key to slow us down. 
We're going as fast as we can. 
All right, I'm off the highway. 
Mile Marker 19. 
Checking surface streets. 
(ringing) Hello, Valley Cab Company. 
May I help you? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm a counter-terrorist agent. 
This is an emergency. 
I don't see any sign of Jack. 
What's further north of here? 
Nothing but national forest for 32 miles. 
He could be in the Central Valley by now. 
Wait. I might 
have found something. 
I'll get back to you. 
Okay. 
Nadia. 
Has Doyle found Jack yet? 
Well, he might have a lead. 
He's checking it out now. 
All right. 
Come with me. 
I'm stepping down as director of CTU. 
What? 
What happened? 
All I can say is I have to step down. 
No. Sir, that 
doesn't make any sense. 
Why would you quit now of all days? 
I'm not quitting. 
I was fired. 
By who? 
It doesn't matter. 
I've contacted Division. 
For now, you're acting director. 
Mr. Buchanan. 
We've been ordered to escort you off the premises. 
I know. 
I'm briefing Ms. Yassir. 
She's taking over as head of CTU. We'll need 
one more minute, please. 
One minute. 
Sir, we're in the middle of 50 different things here. 
Why would they do this to you now? 
I can't talk about it. 
You need to accept it and do the best you can. 
No. I don't understand 
why they would fire you. 
You're the most ethical, dedicated person I've ever known. 
There's no way you did anything to justify this, Damn it, Bill, what is going on? 
It's just politics. 
Division will be sending over an interim director in the next few hours. 
In the meantime, you can handle anything that comes up. 
What about the extra redundancies and everything else I've had to go through today? 
I'm not the right choice to take over. 
I've lifted all the restrictions on your security clearance. 
You shouldn't have any trouble running CTU. 
You are the right choice. 
I don't know what to say. 
Just stay on top of the situation with Jack. 
I will. 
No one else knows I'm leaving You have to inform them before it's posted on the internal forums I'll tell them. 
What you said means a lot. 
(phone ringing) O'Brian. 
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, got it. 
Doyle just called in. 
He's found Jack's truck. 
Good, Morris. 
What's happening to Buchanan? 
He's gone. 
What do you mean, he's gone? 
I'm in charge. 
Can I have everyone's attention, please? 
In a few minutes you're gonna be getting a bulletin on your systems. 
Bill Buchanan has stepped down, which means that until Division can send over a replacement, he's named me acting director. 
Nothing will change operationally. 
Your objective remains the same Bring in Jack Bauer before he can hand over the component to the Chinese. 
Thank you. 
CTU, this is Doyle. 
Do you copy? 
Doyle, you're on com. 
Go ahead. 
Do you have anything on satellite yet? 
MILO: Spotty. 
Well, I found our truck. 
Either Jack switched vehicles or he parked it and he's nearby. 
I'm gonna go look at the buildings. 
All right, there's some infrastructure around we can check using thermal. Chloe? 
I'm on it. 
Hang on. We might 
not need it. 
What do you mean? 
A limo just pulled off the highway. 
Redirect all nearby units to my current location. 
Okay. 
Send Alpha and Delta teams to that location. 
Also send Air One, Two and Three for air support. 
All right. 
Cheng just left the car. 
Far enough. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Where's Audrey? 
She's in the car. 
Until I get the component... 
Nothing's going to happen until I see Audrey. 
I want to make sure she's all right. 
(speaks Chinese) She's coming in now. 
Audrey Raines is entering the premises. 
I think I'm gonna need that backup. 
You have the sub circuit board? 
You'll get it as soon as I know she's safe. 
(speaks Chinese) Take the gag out of her mouth. 
Wait! 
I'll do it. 
(speaks Chinese) (whispering): I'm so sorry. 
CHENG: You can continue this reunion later. 
How is this gonna work, Mr. Bauer? 
Audrey walks out of her alone. 
As soon as I see that she gets down near the bridge I'll know she's out of the range of your sniper. 
Then I'll give you the component. 
There's at least ten guns. 
I need the field teams. 
Let's do this. 
I want you to walk past the bridge a hundred yards, on the right side of the road, do you understand? 
There's a gas station, and a cab will be waiting for you. 
He has instructions to take you back to CTU. 
You need to go. 
Go. 
All right, this is going down now, Nadia. 
Where are the field teams?! 
They should be there any minute. 
I need to do something now. 
They're releasing Audrey which means Jack is about to hand over the component. 
Mike, don't let that happen. 
Give me the circuit board or I'll kill her. 
Oh, damn it! 
(tires squealing) Miss Raines, stay where you are. 
Stay down! 
(men shouting, gunfire continues) (speaks Chinese) CTU, this is Air One. 
Do you copy? 
Go ahead. 
Cheng and his men have escaped. 
They're in three black Hummers heading north towards the mountains. 
Traveling off road. 
Pursue and engage. 
We've been hit! 
We're going down! 
I repeat, we're going down! 
(engine sputtering) * * Agent Bauer, get down! 
My weapon is down! 
Get on the ground! 
Get on the ground! 
Who is your commanding officer?! 
I am, Jack. 
Stand him up. 
Where's the sub-circuit board? 
Cheng's got it. 
I was set to blow the building and destroy the component until you engaged us in a firefight. 
Here's the detonator. 
What's the problem? 
We don't have Cheng, Jack. 
What do you mean, you don't have him? 
The assault teams didn't have time to get into place. 
We had to make a frontal assault. 
He must have escaped out the rear. 
Nadia, did you get that? 
Cheng escaped with the sub-circuit board. 
We got a chopper down. 
We need those other choppers ASAP. 
I know. The chopper should be 
there in five minutes. 
Listen, before they went down, they reported seeing Cheng and his men traveling in three black Hummers in the mountains off road traveling north. 
Copy that. 
Now place Jack under arrest. 
Understood. 
Is he gone? 
Yeah. 
I gotta take you into custody, Jack. 
I had this handled. 
Why the hell didn't you listen to me? 
Audrey, it's over. 
It's all right. 
You're safe. 
Help me, Jack. 
Please don't let them do this to me. 
Audrey... 
Help me, Jack, don't let them do... 
Audrey! 
It's me. I'm right here. 
Do you even know who I am? 
DOYLE: Sit her down. 
They've done something to her. 
You got to help her, please. 
We will. Let's go, Jack. 
Please. 
(indistinct muttering) My God.
