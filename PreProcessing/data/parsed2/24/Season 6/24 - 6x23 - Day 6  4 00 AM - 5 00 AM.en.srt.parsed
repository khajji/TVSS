=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents Bill Buchanan had Fayed in custody... 
and he let him go. 
Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland. 
Someone is going to have to go down the farther from the president, the better. 
Are you asking me to resign? 
HAYES: No, Bill. 
I have to fire you. 
We're talking about the end of my career. 
An FB sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government. 
If the Chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire Russian defense system will be compromised. 
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter. 
You are talking about attacking one of our military bases. 
You have two hours. 
Everyone on the floor! 
CHENG: My men have your grandson. 
Have you finished repairing the sub-circuit board? 
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson. 
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now. 
Hello, Josh. 
Your grandfather wants to speak with you. 
What do you want from me? 
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born. 
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country. 
Cheng, it's over! 
Tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you. 
Help! 
Josh! 
Dad... 
(grunting) I lost the boy. 
PHILLIP: Who has him? 
CTU and your son. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
The boy was my price for repairing the circuit board. 
Our arrangement is over. 
Got Phillip Bauer calling for you on a scrambled line. 
I want my grandson. 
And I want clear passage to the country of my choice. 
You give me that and I'll give you the FB sub-circuit board. 
You're working with the Chinese. 
I was. 
You think Phillip Bauer is somebody that we can trust? 
We have no choice. 
Get me CTU. 
Josh, you need to come with me. 
What do you mean?! 
Come now! 
Agent Doyle! 
Orders, Jack! 
The boy stays with me! 
What are you doing?! 
Josh! 
Where are you taking me? 
I thought we were going back to CTU. 
I'm sorry, Josh. 
You're sorry for what? 
What's going on? 
This has to do with my grandpa. 
Josh, he's got something we need. 
Something that will stop a war. 
So we have to go through the motions of handing you over to him. 
What, meaning you're not actually going to do it? 
Meaning as soon as we get what we need from him, we're gonna recover you. 
We have two Tac teams and LAPD at the rendezvous site. 
This is a locating device, Josh. 
So we're going to be able to track you until we get the green light on your recovery operation. 
Look, I understand you're scared. 
I would be, too. 
But I will get you back, Josh. 
This may sting a little. 
Ow! 
Ryan, we are making a mistake. 
You can't let them do this. 
You can talk to Doyle. 
You can't let them hand Josh over to my father. 
Those orders come from the White House. 
Get in the car. 
Are you arresting me? 
Are you charging me with something? 
No, Jack, we have orders to place you in temporary custody in order to protect our operation. 
Don't make this harder than it is. 
(indistinct radio transmission) (sighs) (phone rings) O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Jack, Nadia said you were in custody. 
Why the hell is CTU handing Josh over to my father? 
It's a tradeoff. 
The order came in from the Vice President. 
Your father got ahold of the FB sub-circuit board. 
He's offering it in exchange for Josh and a safe passage out of the country. 
Whatever my father said, he has no intention of giving up that circuit board. 
The White House feels they have no alternative. 
Apparently, Doyle has a plan to get Josh back. 
My father will have a better plan. 
Damn it, Chloe, we need to stop this. 
Put me through to Karen Hayes. 
Hold on. 
My earlier deception was a desperate move on my part, Mr. President. 
It was a mistake which I'm sure compromised your trust in me, and for that I'm deeply sorry. 
But you are not calling simply to offer your apology. 
Sir, I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response, but an opportunity has presented itself that may allow us both to avoid a war that neither of us wants. 
I am listening. 
The man who has the component is no longer working with the Chinese. 
He's offered to trade it back to us, and I've authorized the exchange. 
For the sake of both our countries, Mr. Vice President, 
I hope it happens soon, because until you have the component, I have no choice but to continue on our present path. 
(phone rings) The chatter we are picking up from Chinese military intelligence is not encouraging, and you and I both know they are far from incompetent. 
I cannot extend or rescind this deadline for anything other than concrete results. 
I understand your position, Mr. President. 
The purpose of this call is just to keep you current on our efforts to try to avoid a conflict. 
Karen Hayes. 
JACK: This is Bauer. 
Do you know of the Vice President's plan to hand my nephew over to my father? 
I do. 
Karen, you cannot let this happen. 
It is a mistake to trust my father. 
You will get nothing back. 
He's gonna keep Josh and the circuit board. 
But why would he need the circuit board? 
Because it's his only leverage with the Chinese. 
He's useless to them without it. 
Whatever you're offering him, the Chinese are offering more. 
Karen, my father is smart enough to manipulate this exchange. 
Look, Jack, I don't think we should go through with this either, but the Vice President feels it's the only way to avoid war. 
He's given his order and I don't have the authority to do anything. 
You're gonna have to take care of this from your end. 
I can't. CTU has put me 
in temporary custody to stop me from interfering with their operation. 
Karen, he is an innocent boy. 
You need to stop this, and you need to stop it now. 
Well, that did not go well. 
Not that I expected much good will from Suvarov. 
I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer. 
I thought he was under arrest. 
He is, but he called me. 
Okay, he called you... 
Yes, and he's convinced that his father will try to get the boy and the circuit board. 
How's he gonna do that? 
We can verify the authenticity of the board before we hand over Josh. 
You think Jack's concerns are warranted? 
Absolutely. He's Phillip Bauer's 
son and he's been more right than we have today. 
Well, point taken there. 
All right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh, which is the only thing Phillip Bauer seems to want. 
How do we get the circuit board? 
Well, if you don't have any ideas, I think I might. 
Wait. If your idea involves 
keeping Daniels in the dark... 
Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you... 
My relationship with the Vice President is complicated, at best. 
I can't be seen making an end run around him. 
But I promise I won't be looking your way if you do. 
(cell phone rings) (snaps phone shut) Hey. Hey! 
That's personal. 
Nothing you need in there. 
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena 
covers everything. I'm sorry. 
It's a family photo album, for crying out loud. 
You haven't been charged with any crimes yet, but that could change. 
(phone rings) RECORDING: You've reached the Buchanan residence. 
Please leave a message. 
HAYES: Bill, I know you're there. 
Please pick up. 
Look, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I really need your help. 
I don't know where else to turn. 
What do you mean, you don't know where else to turn? 
Are you okay? 
No, I'm fine. 
I just... 
I really need your help. 
I'm listening. 
Thank you. 
I know that you're angry with me, and I don't blame you. 
What do you need from me, Karen? 
I just got off the phone with Jack. 
He's being held in custody by CTU. 
Why? 
Because they don't want him to interfere with an ongoing operation. 
What operation? 
Phillip Bauer is now in possession of the component. 
What? 
And he's claiming that he will trade the sub-circuit board for his grandson, but Jack thinks it's a setup; that Phillip will get the boy, keep the component, and make a deal with the Chinese. 
I completely agree. 
Have you spoken to Nadia Yassir? 
Oh, she won't budge on this thing. 
She's under direct orders from the Vice President. 
What are you asking me to do, Karen? 
Whatever it takes to stop the exchange. 
Nadia, we just touched down at the meeting point and I'm not seeing any activity. 
Satellite surveillance confirms that. 
How's the signal on Josh's tracker? 
Coming in clear. 
Tracker's signal's strong. 
Wait here. 
I'm gonna check it out. 
Come on. 
(cell phone rings) CTU, I've got a call coming in. 
It could be him. 
Morris, can you trace the call? 
The signal's scrambled, but we're still patched into Doyle's phone, so we'll be able to listen to both sides of the conversation. 
All right, Mike. 
Go ahead. Answer it. 
This is Doyle. 
Before we do anything, I want CTU to turn off the satellite feed. 
What are you talking about? 
I have an uplink. 
I know when they're watching. 
And I know when they're off-line. 
Stand by. 
Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing? 
MORRIS: Yeah. 
He's not bluffing. 
He's absolutely in our system. 
How? 
I don't know. 
Mike, we have confirmation that Phillip Bauer has tapped into our satellite surveillance. 
Can he see Josh's tracker signal? 
No. That's on 
an internal network. 
All right. 
Then go off-line. 
Tell LAPD and the Tac teams to keep a really wide perimeter outside the satellite area. 
We can't afford to spook him. 
Morris, shut down the satellite. 
Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know. 
On it. 
It's done. 
Mike, satellite is off-line. 
Mr. Bauer, 
CTU's satellite is off-line. 
I can see that. 
Now get rid of the chopper. 
Aerial One, return to base. 
That's an order. 
Now, how do you want to work the exchange? 
Wait there. Someone will come. 
When? 
Whenever I'm damn well ready. 
Put my grandson on the phone. 
Your grandfather. 
He wants to speak with you. 
But don't fight him, Josh. 
Okay? The easier he thinks 
this is going to go, the less on-guard he's going to be. 
Yeah. 
Hello, Joshua. 
Have you given any thought to what we talked about? 
Yes. And I don't want 
to go anywhere with you. 
I hate you! 
Joshua, listen to me. 
I understand you're frightened and angry. 
But your father's involvement in what happened today will soon be public knowledge. 
Staying in this country is not an option. 
There's nothing here for you. 
My mom's here. 
Your mother can join you anytime she wants. 
But she is incapable of giving you what you need. 
Where we're going, I will have the means and the power to help you become the kind of man  your father  should have been. 
Now, you think about that. 
#No sign of anyone so far. 
Yeah. We're still looking for 
ways to get satellite coverage without Phillip Bauer knowing, but so far, it looks like he's covered all his bases. 
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me. 
How do I verify the component's real, once they hand it over? 
Chloe? 
The component has an R-7-2 socket on its underside. 
When you plug your PDA into that, I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here. 
Good. 
Nadia, once I know the component's real, if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'm gonna take it. 
No, you're not, Mike. 
Look, I want to see Josh safe, too, but we're under strict orders from the White House. 
We're not authorized to retrieve him until the component's back at CTU. 
I'm not talking about what I'm authorized to do. 
Well, I am. Mike, there's 
too much at stake. 
You're not going off-book on this. Understood? 
Mike, do you confirm? 
MARCY: Nadia, I have Karen Hayes on two. 
All right. Put it through 
to my cell phone. 
Mike, I have to take this call. 
You're on com with Chloe and Morris. 
Yeah. I'll keep them posted. 
Yes, Ms. Hayes? 
Nadia, the Vice President would like to check on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer. 
Well, the agent handling the exchange is in position with the boy and he's waiting to be contacted. 
I did tell the White House that I would report in as soon as that happened. 
Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure that everyone's onboard. 
That no one, including yourself, has any doubts that this is the right course of action. 
The order comes from the Vice President. 
It's not being questioned. 
What's the status of Jack Bauer? 
He's currently being transferred to the detention at District. 
Good. I need to be able 
to view the operation on your internal deployment grid. 
Do you mind me asking why? 
Yes, actually, I do. 
The Vice President wants me to keep track of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code now, please. 
Right away. 
Log onto the grid on nine-four. 
Security code Alpha-Charlie-November. 
Got it. Thank you. 
I just got a call from Security. 
You better head over to the lounge. 
Why? What's the problem? 
Marilyn Bauer. 
I'm not a prisoner, so stop treating me like one. 
I want to see my son, and I want to see him now! 
And if you can't tell me where he is, I will find somebody who can! 
Get out of my way! 
Get out of my way! 
Listen, Mrs. Bauer. 
If you just calm down, we can talk. 
Did something happen? 
Did he get hurt? 
No. Josh is fine. 
(sighs) He's just being held at Division. 
They want to debrief him while events are still fresh in his mind. 
You have no right to talk to my son if I'm not there. 
He needs to have a parent present. I want to be 
with my son! 
I understand what you're going through. 
No! You have no idea 
what I'm going through! 
And if you don't get me to him right now, I'm going to get our lawyers, and I will take this whole place down, including you! 
(muttering) (phone rings) O'Brian. 
Morris, I need you to send additional security to the lounge area to escort Mrs. Bauer 
to holding. 
MARILYN: I want my son! 
You can't keep me here! 
They're on their way. 
NADIA: Thanks. 
This is Morris O'Brian. 
Can I have two additional security to the lounge area to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding, please? 
Thank you. 
What? 
It doesn't bother you that we're doing this? 
What if we don't get Josh back? 
Phillip Bauer is a murderer. 
I don't like it I hate it but we have our orders. 
Since when do you care about orders? 
We're trying to avoid starting a war. 
Speaking as someone that placed a lot of people's lives at risk today, I can see why it's necessary. Yes. 
Jack thinks we're being manipulated. 
That his father has no intention of giving us the component back. 
I don't think we can count on Jack being objective about his father right now. 
Who cares if he's being objective, if he's right? 
Are you actually angry at me? 
As if I'm the one that made the decision to go through with this? 
No. I... It's just 
that Josh didn't do anything. 
He's innocent. 
Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker. If that signal 
weakens even a little, I want to know about it immediately. 
I will. 
CTU, this is Doyle. 
You're on with O'Brian. 
I've got a helicopter approaching out of the north. 
It's too far to read its markings. 
You think it might be Phillip Bauer? 
I don't know, Morris. 
That's why I'm asking you. 
All right. 
No need to get testy. 
Pulling up the FAA database now. 
Coast Guard has a helicopter patrol just west of your position. 
It's not Phillip Bauer. 
All right. Thanks. 
Doyle? 
Yeah? 
I know that a lot of people disagree with this operation. 
I just want you to know that what you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary. 
Morris, the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. 
Fair enough. 
What is this lunatic doing? 
(horn honking) (tires screeching) Don't move. 
Get your handcuffs out. 
Do it! 
Mr. Buchanan? 
What the hell are you doing? 
You have Jack Bauer in there? 
TURNER: We have orders to transport him to Detention at District. 
I need you to release him to me. 
Mr. Buchanan, you've been 
relieved of duty. 
You know me, Turner. 
I'm no threat to anyone. 
I'm not even armed. 
Stay where you are, sir. 
You're not going to shoot me, Turner. 
Sir, you need to stop coming at me. You know 
what I'll have to do. 
You don't have to do anything. 
You're a good man, Turner. 
I trained you. 
I know you can't possibly believe what's happening here is right. 
I know you're following orders, but your oath of allegiance is not to one single person. 
You swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
The orders you're following are illegal. 
You have an opportunity here, Turner. 
Don't blow it. 
Agent Turner, put the weapon down. 
Put it down. 
They hand Josh over to my father yet? 
No. Doyle's in position 
with the boy. 
He's awaiting instructions from your father. 
Okay. 
Let's go. 
Karen explain everything to you? 
Yeah. 
Thank you for doing this. 
You don't have to thank me. 
You put yourself on the line. 
I appreciate it. 
Let's just hope you're right about your father. 
Unfortunately, I am. 
#Thank you. 
(whispers): Stuart... 
Morris... 
find out who that is. 
I'm so sorry. 
I don't believe we've met. 
Morris O'Brian. 
This is Stuart-- Milo's brother. 
Oh, I'm so very sorry. 
Very sorry. 
I have to sign a release for his body. 
I'll help you with the paperwork. 
Come on. 
Thanks, Chloe. 
He was a good man. 
It's Milo's brother, Stuart. 
(phone ringing) Hi, Karen. 
Hi. 
I've got Jack. 
We're on our way. 
I just... I wanted 
to thank you. 
You didn't have to do this. 
You made a big sacrifice. 
I'm not the only one. 
Won't be long before they figure out how I was able to locate Jack. 
Yeah, well, they already have. 
I've just been denied access. 
They're probably on their way to arrest me. 
Listen... 
I don't know when they'll let us speak to each other again, so I just want you to know that I'm so sorry. 
And I love you very much. 
Me, too. 
They're here. 
Good luck. 
They're about to arrest Karen. 
Hi. 
Stuart? 
Yeah. 
I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU. 
We're in the middle of an operation right now, so I don't have much time. 
I just wanted to meet you and tell you how sorry I am. 
I know your name. 
My brother talked about you. 
I'd like to know how he died. 
Your brother died saving my life. 
He saw that I was in danger, and he stood up for me and sacrificed himself. 
He was very brave. 
No, he wasn't. 
Not really. 
It's more that he was really in love with you. 
(phone ringing) Excuse me. I'll be right back. 
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead. 
Local police found Agents Ryan and Turner handcuffed to their vehicle. 
Jack escaped? How? 
They were intercepted by Bill Buchanan. 
Are you sure? 
Positive. 
Why would Bill do something like that? 
Probably because he agrees with Jack that we shouldn't be trading Josh or trusting his father, regardless of what the orders are. 
Have Tac teams in the area move into position to intercept them. 
They're already doing that. 
I'm sorry, I had to, uh... 
Mr. Doyle... 
Yeah? 
Listen, please don't do this. 
Okay, my grandpa's crazy. 
Okay, just please, just let me go. 
Josh... your country 
needs you to do this. 
I'll get you back, Josh. 
I give you my word. 
Doyle, this is Nadia. 
Do you copy? 
Go ahead, Nadia. 
Any sign of Phillip Bauer yet? 
None yet. 
Mike, Jack escaped from custody. 
We have to assume he's on his way to you to try and stop the exchange. 
How the hell does Jack even know where we are? 
Karen Hayes told him and gave him your location. 
Bill Buchanan helped him escape. 
Damn it. 
I've got Tac teams ready to move in. 
Look, you know we can't bring more men in. 
Phillip Bauer will spot them on satellite and he'll pull out of this. 
Then you'll have to face him alone. 
I'll be fine. 
Is my uncle coming? 
Yeah. 
#Excuse us, please. 
(door closes) I assume you know why I ordered your detention. 
I do. 
Then you admit to using information you got from CTU to assist Bill Buchanan in breaking Jack Bauer out of custody. 
Yes, I do, sir. 
Karen... 
you and I have had our differences, but I thought that we had worked past them, that you and I had finally reached an understanding. 
Clearly, I was mistaken. 
What in the hell were you thinking? 
I learned a hard lesson today, sir, when I trusted Fayed. 
What lesson was that? 
Never negotiate with a sociopath. 
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath. 
We can't trust that he'll give us that component whether we give him the boy or not. 
Damn it, Karen, that is not your call to make. 
I understand that, sir. 
I wouldn't have done what I did if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences. 
Oh, believe me, there will be consequences. 
I will make sure that you and your husband go down hard for this. 
(sighs) You know, it was Tom Lennox who said your different point of view would be an asset to my team, and I believed him. 
Was he in on this with you? 
No, sir. 
He didn't know anything about this. 
Karen... 
if Jack Bauer prevents this exchange from happening, the Russians will attack our forces in Central Asia. 
Any blood that is spilled will be on you. 
(knocks twice) (door closes) (phone ringing) CTU, I've got an incoming call. 
Yeah. 
Take Josh and walk toward the water. 
We're on our way. 
Nadia, did you get that? 
Yes. Agent Doyle, 
be careful. 
We need to go, Josh. 
Tracker shows them moving towards the water. 
MORRIS: Chloe... 
Chloe. 
You all right? 
You look a little pale. 
I'm fine. Just tired. 
(distant whooshing) You hear that? 
Yeah. 
NADIA: Mike, what do you have? 
Nadia, we got two men in a small watercraft coming ashore. 
We're taking cover. 
(motor humming) You stay here, understand? 
Don't move. 
Stop right there. 
Send the kid down now. 
Show the sub-circuit board first. 
I need to verify it. 
Walk forward. 
Place it down. 
Back up. 
(screams) Mike! 
Mike, report in. 
(grunting) There they are. 
They've got Josh. 
I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk. 
(gunfire) Get down! 
Doyle! 
We're gonna get you help. 
The component was a fake. 
It blew. 
Take it easy, Doyle. 
Help's on the way. 
Stay with him, I'm calling CTU. 
(Doyle groaning) Mr. Bauer. 
PHILLIP: Yeah. 
We got the boy. 
Be sure to scan him. 
I don't trust CTU. 
Yes, sir. 
(whirring) (rapid beeping) They tagged him. 
Short it out. 
(electrical whoosh) (yells) It's done. 
(computer blips) We lost the tracker. 
Try the backup frequency. 
I did, it's gone. 
Morris, get that satellite back up now. 
I'm doing it. 
(telephone rings) CTU, Reynolds. 
This is Bauer. 
Patch me through to Nadia. 
I got Jack Bauer on the line. 
Put it on speakerphone. 
Jack, this is Nadia. 
Go ahead. 
Nadia, I'm at the beach. 
The component they delivered to Doyle was a copy. 
The case was loaded with explosives. 
They detonated it. 
Doyle's been badly injured. 
We need a trauma team here now. 
I'm on it. 
Aerial One. 
Aerial One, return to the drop-off point. 
As we arrived, two of my father's men and Josh were headed out to sea in a small boat. 
Jack, they just disabled Josh's tracker. 
Your father forced us to shut down satellite, so it's gonna take us a few minutes to get it back up so we can track them. 
How long is it gonna take to get reinforcements? 
Tac teams are five minutes out. 
Jack... 
how bad is Agent Doyle? 
Bad. We need 
that trauma team. 
Hurry. 
#Sir... 
Melinda said you read the flash regarding CTU's attempt to make the exchange. 
They're still trying to track the watercraft Phillip Bauer's men used to escape. 
They've had no success yet. 
Suvarov is expecting my call to confirm that we've retrieved the component. 
Well, my advice is give CTU a few more minutes before we call the Russians. 
We could still get lucky on this. 
Karen was right. 
Yes, sir. 
She certainly was. 
And I was wrong. 
Not just about... 
Karen, but about Wayne Palmer. 
I judged his performance as President unfairly. 
What he faced these past weeks was an impossible situation. 
Maybe he was right to reach out to Assad, I don't know anymore. 
You know, Tom... 
it's easy to think you've got all the answers when none of the ultimate responsibility lies with you, but... 
(sighs) Sitting in this chair... 
until you sit in this chair, you don't know anything. 
You can't know. 
Sir... 
in view of the fact that Karen was right, you might want to reconsider your punitive stance towards her. 
My decision may have been wrong, but I can't condone that kind of insubordination. 
Sir, you do not want the facts of your disagreement with Karen made public. 
And that's exactly what will happen if you prosecute her. 
After this crisis has passed, Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire quietly to their country home in Vermont. 
You will be honoring her service. 
It's just a better outcome all around. 
I'll take your advice under consideration, Tom. 
But right now, I need a real time update on CTU's progress. 
All right, sir. 
(door opens) (door closes) (sighs heavily) This is Jack. The trauma 
team doesn't believe that Doyle's injuries are life threatening, but he's gonna be blind in one, if not both eyes. 
I should've listened to you, Jack. 
You did what you thought was right. 
Is satellite back up yet? 
Any minute. 
But it'll be next to impossible to find a craft that size in the dark. 
Their boat had limited range. 
They must be meeting up with a larger vessel. 
NADIA: Jack? 
I want you to get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten-mile radius. 
Wh What are you thinking? 
My father's company, BXJ, has shelter corporations. 
They owned oil leases up ande coast. 
He didn't pick this location at random. 
I'm on it.
