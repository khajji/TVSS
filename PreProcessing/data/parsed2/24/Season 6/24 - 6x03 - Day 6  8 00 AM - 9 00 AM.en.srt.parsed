America has been victimized again. 
Last night terrorist attack in San Antonio was not the latest in this series of bombings that began 11 weeks ago in 10 different cities. 
Retrieve the package. 
Call me when you have it. 
 What happened? 
 You shouldn't have come here, Scott. 
I don't wanna hurt you... 
But I will unless you do exactly what I say. 
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney. 
There's no terrorist here. 
Yes, this is Sandra Palmer. 
I'd like to speak with my brother. 
The FBI was just here and they wanted access to the IAA personel records. 
You know I have to do whatever I can to stop this attacks. 
All that includes giving the law inforcement the autority to follow up whatever single lead they get. 
I can't find the files. 
They've been erased. 
Don't bother trying to recall them. 
I used the shredding program. 
Sandra, what're you doing? 
You're under arrest. 
Take Mr Al-Rezani in custody. 
Wait a minute, he has nothing to do with this. 
Don't move. Where is Assad? 
Put down your weapon. 
I came here alone. 
Fayed has set you up. 
He provided CTU with the coordinates to this house. 
Move! Move! 
I've gotten most of my people and the governments that support us to agree to a cease fire with the West. 
And that's Fayed wants to sabotage? 
 Yes. 
But finding Fayed is the key. 
These are Fayed's men. 
They're going in the subway. 
I can't let 'em get on the train. 
Only the bomber is getting on the train. 
The other man is the handler. 
You follow the handler. 
I'm going after the bomber. 
It's a bomb! 
 We're heading in your direction. 
 I copy that. I'll find you. 
Just stay with the handler. 
He's our only connection to Fayed. 
The following takes place between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.(del vo) 
You still have Fayed's man in sight? 
He's in a grey Sedan, about 6 cars ahead. 
 Yes. 
 Are you on schedulled? 
Yeah, there was some traffic around Union Station. 
 But I'm on the road now. 
 There has been a change. 
I need you to make that stop in Newhall before you come back here. 
The Americans will be feeling helpless now. 
I'm making the call. 
The casualty estimates in St Louis is resumed to 112. 
The mall attack in Baltimore is even worse. 
Over 200 dead. 
Many of them children. 
My God. 
What about the bomb in Los Angeles? 
We confirmed that Jack Bauer averted the attack at the Union Station. 
Passive surveillance from Metro Transit has also confirmed he's working with Assad. 
Have you been able to contact him? 
No, sir. 
Jack's been dark since he called to warn us about Fayed. 
We didn't listen. 
I didn't listen. 
We're receiving a call from Fayed. 
He demands to speak with the President. 
Mr President, we're receivnig a call on a scrambled channel from Fayed, sir. 
He's demanding to speak with you. 
Put him on. 
This is President Palmer. 
Mr President, we've proven we can strike at you anytime anywhere. 
But I'm prepared to offer you a cease-fire. 
 If you meet my demands. 
 Your demands? 
Fayed we match your demands before, remember? 
When you deceived us about Assad being the one behind these attacks. 
And now you expect me to just accept your assurances of a cease-fire. 
I expect you'll take any action that holds a promise of avoiding the loss of more american lives. 
What do you want? 
You're holding 110 so called enemy combattants at your Palmdale military facility. 
In violation of the international law. 
You must have all these freedom fighters on a non-military aircraft in the air by the end of the hour. 
The pilot will be informed of the destination once the plane is outside your country's airspace. 
Even if I agree to this  there is not enough time for us to  You'll find a way. 
Because if you don't release the prisonners by the deadline, the consequences will be immediate and devastating. 
I will only make this offer once, Mr President. 
For your country's sake... 
I hope you accept it. 
Is it even possible, that's what these attacks have been about? 
Releasing the prisonners at Palmdale? 
Sir, I feel it's wishful thinking to assume this is Fayed's endgame. 
Bill, contact Palmdale. 
Find out exactly what will be involved in making this happen. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr President... 
you cannot seriously consider giving in to this man's demands. 
I mean you said yourself: Fayed cannot be trusted. 
No, he can't. 
And, Tom, I don't believe for one second he has any intention of stopping these attacks. 
Not permanently. 
But going along with this buys us more time to find Fayed. 
At the very least, it gives the country a respite from the bombings. 
Sir, you'd be releasing 110 extremely dangerous terrorists. 
Karen, I am very well aware of that. 
But unless we find Fayed, I may be forced to. 
 We got a problem. 
 What? 
He's heading north. 
The farther he gets outside of the city, the less traffic we'll have to hide in. 
It's gonna be more difficult to track him all the way without him seing us. 
 What else can we do? 
 We need to call CTU. 
They can give us satellite coverage. 
No, I said no CTU. They killed my men, 
they tried to kill me! 
That's because Fayed made them believe you were behind the bombings. 
I do not work with my enemies. 
You're working with one now. 
You might hate this country, you might hate its values but if you were serious about disarming, about bringing your organization and others to the table, then you know you have to compromise. 
That is your political reality. 
Who's to say they won't put me in prison once they have me? 
I can't tell you they won't. 
But right now, that is our only lead to Fayed. 
Make the call. 
Thank you. 
Morris, I need you to load this. 
What is it? 
The President just got a call from Fayed. 
He demands we release all the prisonners from Palmdale. 
We need to valid each one in case he goes through with it. 
What he wants is some pretty serious high grade terrorist suspect. 
Calm down, no one's not even go. 
Excuse-me... 
Are you refusing to do this? 
I think you should give this one to the girls in Archives. 
I'm working on Fayed threats, that's more important. 
Okay, I don't really care what you think is important. 
It's not your place to tell me what's important. 
Just calm down. 
I'm trying to help you do your job. 
You have to evaluate directives that come down. 
You can't just keep wasting the time of your most important analysts. 
 I'm not... 
 Morris. 
What? What? 
I want you to put filters on each one of these files. 
If I don't have results on my screen in 20 minutes you are outta here. 
Grow up. 
 O'Brian. 
 Chloe, this is Jack. 
I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again. 
I don't have a lotta time. 
I need to speak to Bill Buchanan. 
Hold on. 
Buchanan. 
It's Jack on line 1. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 I'm in a car with Assad. 
We're tracking one of the suspects in the train bombing. 
We know you're working with Assad. 
Are you sure you can trust him? 
I think so. 
What do you need, Jack? 
The suspect's on Florence crossing Ormond. 
We believe is ultimately gonna lead us to Fayed but we need Chloe to give us satellite support. 
Loggin' on to the NSA server now. 
Jack, Fayed just contacted the President Palmer and demanded he releases the prisonners we're holding in Palmdale. 
What's the President's position? 
If we don't find Fayed by the 9:00 a.m. deadline 
I believe he'll go through with it. 
This could take me at least 10 min to get satellite coverage. 
I had to send the repositionning orders for the sub server. 
That's too long, the suspects is entering route 7. 
If we try to follow him, he'll see us. 
Chloe, can you speed up access? 
No, the sat queue's overloaded, the entire country's on high alert. 
We'll use CalTrans cameras to track him till the satellite reposition. 
If there was a traffic camera on route 7. 
There isn't, I already looked. 
You're gonna have to figure out another way to track him until we get the satellite up. 
 Where's yout nearest tac team? 
 Curtis has a unit... 
12 miles away. 
Send him in my direction. 
I'll get back to you. 
Do you think this man will recognize you? 
No. What do you have in mind? 
Curtis Manning on com. 
Curtis, I just spoke to Jack. 
He's surveilling one of Fayed's men and needs backup. 
 Where is he? 
 Last known was Florence Blvd near the entrance to Route 7. 
He's running this operation with Assad. 
Did I hear that correctly? 
We're working with Assad? 
Your orders are to rendez-vous with them and lend support. 
All warants on Assad are resended for the time being. Understood? 
Curtis? 
We're on our way. 
Don't get up! 
What's wrong with you? 
I know you saw me coming! 
 It was my right of way! 
 You tell me I don't know how to drive? 
I'm talking to you! 
Hey, you're alright? 
I saw the whole thing. 
Get out of here! 
This is got nothing to do with you. 
I'm a witness! 
You drove straight into him! 
What is it with you, people? 
You're gonna stick up for him? 
Fine. I'll wait here 
until the police arrives. 
Screw both of you. 
Screw you! 
Where are you going? 
Hey, this is your fault! 
I saw his licence for the police. 
I can't wait for the police. 
I can't drive this. 
I need to be somewhere. 
I'll just have to deal with this later. 
Where are you going? 
Newhall. I was getting on route 7. 
I can take you to Newhall, I'll drop you there. Come. 
 Come! 
 Thank you. 
I hope you're not gonna let that bastard get away with this. 
Hit-and-run is a crime. 
You must file a police report. 
I know. 
Come on... 
CTU? 
This is Jack Bauer. 
I need to speak with Bill Buchanan. 
Hold, please. 
Bill, it's Jack. 
Fayed's man is now in a car with Assad. 
What happened? 
The suspect was involved in a traffic incident. 
Listen to me. 
Assad has let his cell phone opened so that we can monitor the call. 
I'm gonna be following roughly 2 miles behind in a white Jeep Cherokee. 
Through conversation with the suspect, Assad'll let us know where he's going. 
I'm ready to transfer you into the car. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
Bill, they cant hear us on their side. 
You should be on call, now. 
I don't know Newhall very well. 
 I need you to guide me, please. 
 I will. 
Nadia, pull* all agency data pour on Newhall, to set up perimeters for a sort. 
Chloe, when you get the satellite, make sure we have coverage of that area. 
Let Curtis know that he is to intercept Jack somewhere on route 7 on the way to Newhall. 
Fayed? 
What is it? 
Our scout is reporting increased activity around the Palmdale military prison. 
The transport buses are starting to arrive. 
Good. 
By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened. 
We still don't have the component. 
We will. 
Ahmed should be on his way to pick it up, now. 
Scott? Is that you? 
Yeah. 
Honey, we were beginning to get worried. 
 My God, Ahmed! What happened? 
 Mom, he has a gun. 
What's going on? 
What is this? Where is Ray? 
Just put the gun down, and... 
 ... tell me what's happening. 
 Call him. 
Ray? 
Yeah. 
What the hell... 
Don't wanna hurt any of you, but I will unless you do exactly what I say. 
You're a nurse, right? 
 You have medical supplies, bandages? 
 Yeah. 
Go get them. 
Now! 
You two... on the couch. 
Now, come on! 
Sit... down! 
Now! 
I need you to patch this leg. 
Stop the bleeding. 
My God, Stan was right. 
You are a terrorist. 
Stan is dead. 
He killed him. 
What? I can't stop this bleeding. 
Don't tell me that you can't! 
The wound's too deep. 
You have muscle tissue damage. 
You need to see a doctor. 
Just bandage it! 
There's a package in there. 
I'm supposed to take it to a man who has an item for me. 
Press. 
Obviously, I can't do that now. 
So, you gonna have to. 
I'm not leaving you alone with my family. 
Your family will be safe when you do what I say. 
When you pick up the item, you'll call me, and I'll give you further instructions. 
What's in this package? 
That's not of your concern. 
You're just making a drop. 
Grab that phone and come here. 
Come here, come here. 
Understand this: if I see anyone... 
police, FBI, anybody outside this house, or if you take too long, your wife and son are dead. 
Do you understand me? Look at me! 
Do you understand me? 
I understand. 
Where am I going? 
There's an address on the front pocket of that backpack. 
It's a man named Marcus. 
Go! 
Curtis, how far away are you? 
Less than five minutes. 
Get there as fast as you can. 
Assad and Fayed's man are on open road. 
They're already five miles ahead. 
Got it. 
 Darling? 
 What? 
Since when do you take Milo's side against me? 
 You're doing him again. 
 I was not, my lovely. 
Your pick on your bosses whenever you get stressed out. 
Milo's not my boss. 
Heaven forbids. 
Well, he might as well be. 
He can bounce you. 
Which is what I think you really want, sometimes. 
And why would I want that? 
I don't know, it's your character form, not mine. 
The files you wanted are all unlocked. 
They'll be on your screen in a minute. 
Good. 
Mr. President? 
I just got off the phone with CTU. 
They reconnected with Jack Bauer. 
Where is he? 
He's following a man he's identified as one of Fayed's operatives. 
CTU is now coordinating support for Jack because they believe this man will lead them to Fayed's location. 
Did CTU offer a time frame for locating Fayed? 
No, sir. At this point, any estimates 
would be premature. 
And did you speak with the Palmdale facility? 
Yes, and the airfield. 
If we wanna meet Fayed's deadline and have these prisoners in the air before the end of the hour, we have to have them on buses and the road within the next 10 minutes. 
If you still want to proceed... 
with that option. 
Listen, Karen. 
I know you disapprove of my decision. 
But unless Jack and CTU call to say they have Fayed, there is no other option here. 
Tell them to load the buses. 
Yes, M. President. 
Sand Canyon Road. 
What? 
I was just remembering. 
I had a friend who lived on Sand Canyon Road. 
We can take the service road from here. 
They're 2 miles ahead of us on the service road. 
We can monitor their direction with their cell phone. 
CTU wants you on com. 
 Copy? 
 10/4. 
 CTU, this is Manning. 
 Go ahead, Curtis. 
Bill, I'm with Jack. 
Do we have satellite access, yet? 
It's coming up. 
Is Jack on the line? 
I'm here, Bill. 
We're redirecting the NSA satellite to the area around Sand Canyon road exit mark. 
As soon as we have a fix on Assad's vehicle we'll upload it to your GPS. 
Copy that. 
Good to see you, Jack. 
I'm sorry for what you're put through. 
I'm glad you're back. 
Now, I have to work with Assad. 
Doesn't that bother you? 
The man's a terrorist, Jack! 
Responsible for taking hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent lives over the past twenty years. 
Doesn't that mean anything to you? 
I don't know what means anything anymore, Curtis. 
I've spend my all life defending this country against people like Assad. 
And now, he's trying to disarm his people, renounce terrorism. 
Playing field has changed. 
And that doesn't change Assad's past. 
We have to make sure that he paies for  the crimes that he's committed. 
He's our only chance at a peaceful resolution of all of this. 
That might not happened. 
Anyway, that's not our call to make. 
We'll see. 
What is that supposed to mean? 
Nothing. 
Good. 
This isn't working. 
There's still too much pain, I need something stronger. 
There are some prescription pain killers in the kitchen. 
Get them. 
And some water. 
Make sure I can see you. 
They are in the cabinet over the TV. 
Give it to me. 
Sit down. 
Sit... down! 
Sit down, sweaty. 
Form an orderly line! 
Head count will be taken. 
Then, and only then, you'll be loaded onto those buses Understand? 
Any problem you cause will only delay this process. 
Get in line! 
I'll tell him. Right. 
It was the FBI. 
Your sister, she's been arrested. 
What? 
 When? 
 Less than an hour ago. 
The FBI agents were sent to the offices of the Islamic American Alliance to serve a warrant for the personnel files. 
Sandra proceeded to delete them right in front of the agents. 
They had no choice but to arrest her. 
Damn it! 
Where is she been taken, Tom? 
She's been detained. 
One of our provisional facilities. 
Walid, I am so sorry, I got you into this. 
I deleted those files. 
It wasn't right for them to arrest to you for my actions. 
You have nothing to apologize for. 
You were protecting the right of innocent Americans. 
It's what this country stand for, even if the government forgot it. 
Back away! 
Move back. 
Come on! 
You take him. 
Where are you taking him? 
Walid! 
I'll be alright. 
Over here, Ms. Palmer. 
Take-off her cuffs. 
For you. 
I'll be right here. 
Please hold for the President... 
What were you thinking, deleting those files? 
I was standing-up to unlawful seizure. 
You making a point, is the last thing I need today. 
I have ordered your release. 
Agents are waiting outside. 
with instructions to take you back home. 
I don't want to be released, Wayne. 
I want to fight this. 
Bring attention to the civil liberties that you administration has allowed to be violated. 
Do you have any idea what's going on today? 
Of course I do. 
Innocent people are dying all over the country and you choose now to make a civil right case out of this. 
Well, somebody has to! 
Look, if you gonna release anybody, it should be Walid. 
Walid is the head of an organization under investigation. 
Now, the FBI just wants to hold him until it can be determined what was in those files you deleted. 
There is nothing increminating on those files. 
Wayne, you have my word. 
Walid is innocent! 
The Walid has nothing to worry about, Sandra. 
Listen... 
I don't have time for this. 
You are released. 
Go home, I will call you later. 
I need to speak to Walid before I leave here. 
That's not going to happen. 
I'm his attorney, you have to give access to him. 
Don't tell me what I have to do, Ms. Palmer, 
I'm following orders. 
Walid has rights! 
Limited rights, Ms. Palmer. 
He's been held under the revised ennemy combatant statute. 
Applying this statute to somebody like him is ridiculous. 
Is the law just been completely thrown through the windows? 
When you're through the lectures, I have orders to drive you home. 
Ma'am. 
Stay to the left. 
Once inside the secure zone, you will disrobe. 
After a cavity search, we will giving back your clothing. 
Sir, you have to keep moving. 
I don't care. 
I'm innocent. 
I want to talk to somebody, an authority. 
We're not gonna ask you again. 
Hey, don't touch me! 
Let him alone! 
Sir, get back in line! 
Not until you will let go that man! 
Take your hands of me! 
Take him to interrogation. 
Do you live around here? 
No. 
Visiting relatives? 
Why are you asking? 
I need to make sure you can get back to your car. 
 I'll be okay. 
 "I'll be okay." 
My son is as this. 
He has a memory like a fish. 
His mother is very worried. 
At the next corner, make a right. 
Then drop me off at the end of the street. 
Did you copy that? 
It's the sixty five hundred block of Alderton. 
Bring out the data on all commercial and restaurant buildings within an half mile and then begin a free sort. 
You mean like I'm doing already? 
Right over here. 
 Alright, thanks again for your help. 
 Please, it's nothing. 
He's cross the sixty fourth road headed towards the commercial district. 
 I'm turning around. 
 Here he is. 
We've acquired the suspect on satellite. 
Curtis, have your men setup a moving perimeter. 
Carrier, take him at across exit port road, setup a moving perimeter behind the target. 
He'll be well trained be carefull. 
My men know their job. 
 Do I know you? 
 No... 
 but I know you. 
 Subject entering a commercial building one block south of where you are. 
Copy that. 
Borman, we're gonna take Assad with us. 
Keep him on a close watch searching for weapons. 
Curtis, Assad is a part of this operation. 
Not anymore. 
Wait, wait. 
I'll take care of it as soon as this is over. 
I promise. 
Thank you. 
The building is a self storage facility. 
14 200 units. 
Borman, keep him here. 
 Team leader, do you copy? 
 Go ahead, Carrier. 
I can see two dozen cases of amunition Boxes with czech writing. 
Bill, this is a dead drop, Fayed's not here. 
We only have a few minutes, Jack. 
If the suspect is not going to lead us to Fayed, in order to stop the prisoners exchange, we have to move in now. 
Get the information through interrogation. 
Bill, that's too risky. 
We have no guarantee we can make him talk in time. 
That's a risk we have to take. 
Curtis, move your men into position. 
Understood. 
All teams, we're moving in. 
Stealth approach, none lethal force. 
Come where I can see you. 
Step out with you hands up. 
Everyone's back! 
Boggey*** the nurse fire hall.**** 
Get the fire department of LA here, now! 
Bill, it's Jack, suspect is dead. 
He was taking a laptop out of this storage unit. 
We'll check the hardrive but it has been badly damaged. 
Understood Jack, I need the President. 
That's a feed of the prisoners in Palmdale. 
Yes. 
Mr. President, I have Bill Buchanan 
on the line for you. 
 Put him on. 
 Yes, sir. 
Mr President, we got a set back to our operation. 
 What happened, Bill? 
 The suspect Jack was following chose to kill himself rather than be apprehended. 
We're examining the area for evidence but there is no telling how long it will take or if it will lead us to Fayed, sir, I'm sorry. 
So am I. 
 Keep me informed. 
 Of course. 
Mr President if you intend on following through with this prisoner release, we wait orders. 
Load them on the plane. 
This is Lennox. 
The President has made is decision: load the prisoners on the plane. 
Head counts is correct and all men are accounted for on bus three. 
I want confirmed head counts on all other vehicules. 
Copy that. Bus 1 confirmed. 
Roger that. 
We will proceed single file and in orderly man onto the plane. 
There will be no mistakes, and no disorder. 
Is that clear? 
Let's get this buses out of here as soon as we can. 
 Let's move. 
 Yes, sir. 
We've just heard from the airport. 
Our people are beiing loaded on to the plane. 
The President has giving in to us. 
Hello. 
Back here. 
 You're Marcus. 
 Who are you? 
I'm supposed to give this to you. 
And your supposed to give me something in return. 
That's not enough. 
What do you mean? 
Component cost me a little more than I though it would. 
I need another 50.000. 
But that's all he gave me. 
Well, go back and get the rest. 
I can't do that. 
Look, I need whatever it is you're selling, please. 
Just... 
take the money. I am begging you. 
Until you get more money, we got nothing more to talk about. 
 Can I use your phone? 
 Yeah. 
He wants another 50.000 dollars. 
Tell him you don't have it. 
I did... 
and he said to come back when I get it. 
Listen to me. 
There is no more money, I don't care what you have to do, but you have to get that item from him. 
Do you understand what happens here if you don't, right ? 
Yeah, I understand. 
 What did he say. 
 Well, he say that I'll get the money. 
And, before, you know I bring it back here, he just want us to make sure you really have it. 
There it is. 
Son of a bitch. 
I'll kill you... 
Shut up and just take the money, just take it. 
OK, Jack, the hardrive is mostly toasted, but i was able to recover the most recently accessed files. 
Some kind of wiring schematic how much of the file to we have. 
About a page and a half mostly in arabic, some of it in russian. 
Get Assad over here now. 
Borman. 
Bring him. 
Do you know what this is? 
This is a list of electronic components. 
You have specifications, programing instructions for a detonator. 
But... 
this... 
is for a nuclear device. 
Is it even possible that Fayed could have acquired a nuclear weapon? 
My organisation has tryed unsuccesfully in the past. 
It's possible he may have found a way. 
Son of a bitch. 
You know about that all along... 
Curtis, get off of him now. 
Assad, please. 
There is a reference file at the bottom of the page. 
Softel 3. 
That's a compact bomb the soviets made in the late eighties. 
 It refer to the suitecase nuke. 
 Are they all accounted for? 
Officialy they were all destroyed, but there was a claim that one device was deverted to a nuclear scientist who's suspected terrorist ties. 
He call's himself Saif-al-Din. 
Looking up his file now. 
There won't be much, Saif-al-Din is a code name, it mean: "sword of the faith." 
intel just never discover his identity. 
Jack, we have one surveillance photo, it's about 6 years old Put it up. 
 Do you recognize him? 
 Yes. 
I saw him with Fayed a year ago. 
His name is Numair, Hasan Numair. 
 Did you copy that? 
 Looking up his name. 
We need to know where this man is now. 
I think we already do. 
Hasan Numair is a terrorist being release from the Palmdale military prison. 
Get on the phone the white house. 
Chloe bring up the feed on the airfield. 
This is what Fayed has been planning all along. 
This bombings where designed to make you free this man. 
Son of a bitch. 
Chloe, have they freed the prisoners yet? 
No, they're on the plane and there'll be 2 min before they're in the air. 
Give me the CO of the airfield, send it to my office. 
Nadia, tell the President I'm stopping the release. 
That is Nadia Yassir from CTU. 
I need to speak with The President, priority three. 
This is Bill Buchanan. The prisoner 
you're looking for is Hasan Numair. 
I'm sending his picture to your PDA. 
Roger that. 
Prisoner Numair, raise your hand. 
I've got the photo. 
Copy that. 
Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now. 
We need to go over every square inch of this plane. 
Someone let the sergent know, he needs to get up here now. 
Hurry up. 
Fayed is waiting for you.
