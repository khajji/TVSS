=The Last Fantasy= Proudly Presents 24ep06 MAN: Going down! No! 
WAYNE:  How many people died in this? 
No less than 12,000. 
Four more tactical nuclear weapons were stolen along with the one that went off. 
 CTU was trying to determine where Fayed was at the time. 
The worst case scenario is that he is still alive and in possession of the remaining nuclear weapons. 
My engineer died in the blast. 
The device used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed as well. 
 I have four more bombs  whose triggers need to be made operational. 
We need someone who could replicate what that device did, with modern equipment. 
McCarthy will find someone for us. 
Tell the man these bombs will go off today. 
Walid overheard some conversations about the bombs. 
 If there is an active  shell inside  that detention facility,  we need Walid to find out more. 
He's wiring you. 
It's a two-way radio. 
Now you're going to tell me what we found in your wallet, you understand me? 
(grunts) You're going to say that I asked about this man. 
Got to make them believe you're working for them. 
What if they find out he's wearing a wire? 
The guards inside know what's going on. 
They'll keep an eye on him. 
I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex-Soviet general about the cache of tactical nuclear weapons. 
What was the name of the general? 
Dmitri Gredenko. 
Assad just gave us the name of a Russian general Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes. 
 Gredenko did business  with BXJ Technologies,  specifically with your father. 
My father? 
I haven't spoken to him for over nine years. 
Well, we'll send someone over to talk to him. 
I should do this. 
He'll talk to me, if I go alone. 
You will never guess who just called here. 
Who? 
Your brother Jack. 
 What's he want? 
He's looking for the old man. 
Damn it, we should have killed Jack when we had the chance, instead of handing him over to the Chinese. 
Look at the bright side: you got out you're here so just relax a little bit. 
Gray, people in this country are dying. 
And I need some information. 
Are you going to give it to me or do I have to start hurting you? 
I told you I don't know where Dad is. 
What do you want from me? 
The truth! 
That is the truth. 
I swear to you on my family's life. 
Not good enough. 
(sudden shout) WAYNE: Although the crisis we face today is a grave and dire one, we will rise above it. 
We have been challenged as never before. 
This time, against this enemy, armed with these weapons, we must rely on the strength and faith of every single American. 
And that faith is unshakable. 
We must rise above our fears, above our bigotries and stand our ground. 
Our goal is the defeat of the enemy and the preservation of our values. 
We've achieved that goal in the past. 
And so we shall again. 
Thank you. 
I wish he had not said that. 
Sir? 
Made a promise he can't keep. 
The American people have got to get used to the fact these security measures are a way of life, they're not some temporary Band-Aid. 
Now you're making policy unilaterally, Tom. 
The president was absolutely clear about your proposals. 
I'm sorry, what is this about, Karen? 
"National Guard supplanting police "in major cities, expanding detentions based on soft intel." 
You authorized these without presidential consent. 
Now how many times do you think we are going to be going over this? 
I am taking preparatory steps to allow the president to act swiftly, should he decide to act at all. 
Nobody is authorizing anything. 
That's what you said about the detention facilities, and yet those "preparatory measures" turned into an illegal paramilitary operation. 
Well, however you may choose to characterize it, The president agreed to all of these actions... 
That's because you've distorted the facts. 
What is it, Tom? 
Is it that you think I'm some bleeding heart liberal preaching civil liberties is that it? 
I'll tell you what I think. 
The Constitution is a wonderful thing, Karen, but back in the days of the Founding Fathers, the weapon at hand was a single-shot musket. 
It took a half a minute to load and fire. 
Fayed just killed 12,000 people in less time without even taking aim. 
I love the Constitution, but I won't be ducking behind it when the next nuke goes off. 
I'm a realist, too, Tom, and I am willing to do what it takes to protect this country... 
No, you are not! 
But I am looking a little further down the road. 
These warrantless arrests and detention centers will cause irreparable damage to this country. 
Hey, you know something? 
Why don't you just hop a shuttle over to Justice Department... 
You are using this crisis... 
You don't belong in National Security. 
...to advance a very 
dangerous agenda, Tom, and take advantage of Presidential power. 
You know something? 
I'm done in here. 
And I will not let you do it. 
And if you think that you are going to wear me down, you are sadly mistaken. 
Actually, you're wearing me down. 
No, that's right, you won't make the same mistake again, because you're going to give the file to Sharon, she's going to handle it from there. 
No, get it done. 
I need Karen Hayes to go away. 
I'm putting the last ties on that... 
I need this now. 
I need the president to sign off on my proposals. 
She has gone from being an irritant to an obstacle. 
And she will be gone soon, sir, I promise. 
I'm just waiting to hear back from a few more people, then you can approach her. 
This work you're doing for me, it doesn't go unnoticed. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr. Buchanan. 
Yes. 
Are you aware of the internal security mandate that's just been issued? 
I haven't looked at the hourlies yet. 
What's going on? 
Anyone identified with a Middle Eastern background is required to put a redundancy layer on all their log-ins. 
I see. 
Look, normally, I'm not sensitive to this kind of thing, you know that, but this is not the time to be racially profiling people who have grade-four security clearance. 
I agree, I'm not going to argue with you. 
Good-- so you give me an exemption? 
I'll take this issue to the attorney general, but it's not going to happen right away. 
Well, how am I supposed to work with one hand tied behind my back? 
Listen, you and I both knew when I hired you that a Muslim working counter-terror in the United States was going to have to put up with some unfair measures-- this is one of them. 
I know. 
But today, of all days... 
Especially today. 
I need you to stay focused on the big picture. 
When this is behind us, I will take this issue to the attorney general, I promise you. 
Have we heard from Jack yet? 
Not since he went to go see his brother. 
Want me to try and reach him? 
No. He'll call us 
when he has something. 
(muffled grunt, rapid gasping) (explosive cough, wheezing) You lie to me again, the bag goes back on. 
Do you understand me? 
(raspy coughing) Start talking, Gray! 
(gasping): Dad... 
Dad didn't want anyone to know where he went. 
He didn't even leave a number, in case of an emergency? 
No, you can't reach him, Jack. 
(catching breath): After the bomb was... 
detonated, he told me he was cutting himself off. 
(crying quietly) I don't believe you. 
(sobs loudly) I think he told you where he was going. 
No, no! It's the truth! 
Fine... 
No, no! 
I don't know! I don't know! 
All right, all right, all right, all right! 
(growling gasps) He went to see a... 
a guy who works for us. 
His name's Darren McCarthy. 
Why? 
It was my fault. 
I made a mess. 
Dad's trying to clean it up. 
What do you mean? 
You were right. 
It's about the nukes. 
(sighs, gasps) The connection you found between Dad and Gredenko had to do with a... a contract 
that was awarded to us. 
Through the company? 
Yeah, it all went through BXJ. 
What did an ex-Russian general have to do with the contract? 
It was his job... to release 
the old nukes into the U.S. 
for decommissioning. 
BXJ was hired to dismantle some of the smaller bombs and to recycle their cores into energy production we do it all the time. 
What happened? 
(heavy sigh) I hired McCarthy to oversee the job, but I didn't check him out carefully enough. 
So, basically, he came in with the lowest bid and you just hired him! 
I-I... M-My head was into 
other things at the time. 
I-I-I... H-He came in 
with good references. 
I saw no reason to get all anal about it. 
So the nukes that these terrorists are in possession of, including the one that was just detonated in Valencia, were supplied by McCarthy and stolen from you. 
Yes, in a nutshell, that's it. 
Sam told me Dad left yesterday... 
which means that you and he knew about this before today, and you didn't report it. 
We didn't report it because we thought we could take care of it more efficiently. 
Damn it, Gray! 
Do you know how many people have died because you're trying to cover your ass?! 
We had no idea that this was going to happen. 
And besides, what Dad and I are doing to stop this is more effective than what you and your people are gonna do. 
What, exactly, are you doing? 
Dad put together a security team and he went out to look for McCarthy. 
Where? 
He was staking out McCarthy's office. 
He checked in about an hour ago. 
Where is this office? 
He's in Simi. 
We're going. 
I'm not leaving my family, Jack. 
Not today. 
Oh, yes, you are. 
Get up! 
Graem, where are you going? 
Jack and I have to go find Dad. 
What do you mean, find him? 
He's not reachable right now; we have to go out  and pick him up-- I want you to stay here, all right? 
You stay with Josh, don't either of you go outside the house. 
I'll be back as soon as I can. 
What's the address? 
McCarthy's office is off the 23. 
5137 Olson Avenue. 
Who are you calling? 
(phone ringing) CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Let me speak to Bill. 
He's being briefed on Fayed. 
Have you picked up any threads? 
Not yet. 
I've got one-- I want you to send two field units to 5137 Olson Avenue, in Simi Valley. 
It should be off the 23. 
I want them to wait for me there. 
Get Bill to call me back as soon as he's out of the briefing. 
Okay, I will. 
So that's it, Jack, huh? 
You're just gonna sell out Dad and me. 
We've been monitoring ground movement ever since the bomb went off. 
We locked down streets, we're doing vehicle searches so far, nothing. 
No sign of Fayed. 
MORRIS: Which means he could still hunkered down within the perimeter-- what are we doing about that? 
We've got NEST teams in the area now. 
They're going street by street. 
That'll take hours. 
Yeah, Morris, it's all going to take time. 
If we could do it quicker, we would. 
We can use the direction of the fallout to our advantage. 
If Fayed is still in the perimeter, he'll be moving in the opposite direction. 
And he'll have to be monitoring the fallout. 
Which means he's got technology in the "on" position. 
Let's use radio frequency satellite, see what we can come up with. 
Good. 
Get on it. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
Jack just called in. 
He's following some kind of lead in Simi Valley. 
He wants you to call him right away. 
Anything else? 
Nothing. 
He asked me to send two teams to meet him. 
Any leads on finding Gredenko? 
Not yet. 
CIA is trying to track him down in Moscow. 
Okay, thank you. 
If you give CTU McCarthy's name, they will eventually come after the family. 
That is not necessarily true. 
CTU is interested in finding these bombs, not networking a series of indictments. 
Oh, will you not be so simple-minded for once in your life! 
CTU, like every other federal organization, is made up of human beings with ambition. 
When the dust settles, they will start digging deeper, you can count on it. 
Well, unfortunately for you, Gray, right now you're going to have to trust me. 
Trust you? After what you 
did to me at the house, all I trust in is your sadistic tendencies. 
(cell phone ringing) This is Bauer. 
What'd you find out? 
Bill, I want you to run a locater check on a Darren McCarthy. 
Who is he? 
He was an independent munitions contractor. 
He worked for BXJ Technologies. 
How does McCarthy figure into all this? 
My father's company hired him to decommission the nukes. 
I believe he brokered them to Fayed. 
So except for McCarthy, your father's company had nothing to do with Fayed? 
I don't know BXJ's involvement yet. 
All right, we're on it. 
Where are you? 
I'm heading to McCarthy's office in Simi Valley. 
I don't think he's there, but I might be able to get something off his computer. 
We have teams standing by. 
Let me know. 
Copy that. 
(phone snaps shut) You know, if you're doing this to come after me, eventually Dad will get caught in the middle. 
Or maybe you want that, maybe you want Dad to go to prison, too. 
Boy, Jack... 
it's good to see your loyalty's still with your family. 
If I were you, I wouldn't talk about loyalty. 
McCARTHY: I know it's not easy, that's why they're willing to pay $7 million cash. 
What about Taylor Paskal, why can't he do it? 
MAN (on phone): He's a theoretical physicist. 
He doesn't have enough practical background to reprogram a nuclear trigger. 
Who does? 
I'm still looking. 
Fayed needs someone now; get me a name, damn it! 
(slams phone down) Where are we going now? 
What do you care where we're going? 
Darren, I don't feel safe in this city. 
I was here when you mentioned that earlier. 
Okay... It seems to me 
like whatever this is you're trying to do is a long shot. 
You're just going to waste all this time and it's going to be harder to get away. 
(tires screeching) Get out. 
What?! 
Your negativity is not what I need right now. 
I need less stress, not more. 
(gasping) (wry laugh) How sure a thing... 
is this $7 million? 
Now that's the type of question that I love hearing from you. 
(cell phone ringing) Yeah. 
Have you found an engineer? 
Not yet. 
Why not? 
(sighs): Give me a break, Fayed. 
This is not some easy one-stop shopping. 
You said within the hour. 
I know what I said. 
It's just taking longer. 
I told you I'd find someone and I will. 
(closes phone) SAMUELS: That's the last of the group. 
So what do you do with them now? 
Patch the images over to CTU. 
They can cross them with international watch lists. 
Didn't you already vet these people? 
CTU has more resources. 
They can go deeper, find the connection to Fayed. 
Samuels just sent us images of the men Walid is undercover with. 
MORRIS: Excellent. 
Send them to my system, when Nadia gets me the manifest; I'll cross them against all of our watch lists. 
Wait... Nadia didn't get you 
the manifests yet? 
No. 
Why not? 
I haven't a clue, mate. 
Hey, you were supposed to send the manifest from the detention facility over to comm. 
Why don't we have it yet? 
I'm backed up. 
Well, why are you backed up? 
Milo, I'm doing the best that I can here. 
You got a problem with it, take it somewhere else. 
Hey... 
I'm just trying to understand what the problem is. 
The detention facility's one of the only live leads we have. 
Go ask Buchanan. 
Okay. 
We've got a support team in place, if Jack needs more backup, he'll let you know. 
Yeah. 
What is it, Milo? 
Nadia. 
She's falling behind on her tasks. 
What's going on with her? 
Nothing. 
Petition her workload and hand some of it off to another analyst. 
I've only got her working on one process. 
She's doing some things for me directly, Milo. 
Just do it, please. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
with all due respect, is there something going on here you don't want me to know about? 
Yes, there is, Milo. 
Either give Nadia enough time to finish the work, or give the work to somebody else. 
Sir, I'm the technical leader on the floor. 
If you want me to do my job effectively, I need to know what's happening. 
Because Nadia's of Middle Eastern descent, she's been flagged by Homeland Security. 
That's ridiculous. 
She's... lived in this country 
since she was two years old. 
She's... a registered 
Republican, for crying out loud. 
You're wasting your breath, Milo there's nothing I can do about this right now. 
Let it go, will you please? 
No, sir, I don't see how we can just "let it go." 
Aren't we trying to find four suitcase nukes that might still be in this city? 
Milo... 
I need everyone on the floor working at full speed. 
I understand that, Milo. 
Now get back to work. 
Yes, sir. 
(phone ringing) Yeah, hi. 
Have you heard about this latest mandate from Homeland Security? 
No, why. What is it? 
They're racially profiling our own agents. 
What?! 
It just came down from the White House. 
The problem is one of my best people is hamstrung. 
She has to work twice as hard to get through these security measures. 
They're not security measures, Bill. 
They're the paranoid delusions of Tom Lennox. 
Is there anything you can do? 
I can talk to the president. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
(hangs up phone) He went off to Valencia over an hour ago. 
How many were killed? 
We don't know yet. 
(over speaker): They say there are four more visitors. 
WALID: Four more visitors. 
What does that mean? 
I'm not sure. 
But you think it may have something to do with what happened in Valencia? 
How did you get the information? 
Why are you asking so many questions? 
Whatever happens out there affects us in here. 
We need to share  everything we know. 
Heydar has been in contact. 
How? 
He smuggled in a cell phone. 
How did you do that? 
Cell phone? How did he get 
a cell phone in there? 
These facilities were put up quickly. 
The security's still pretty porous. 
Then we need to get this man's phone and find out who he's talking to. 
If Walid can get the phone, I can trace any call that's been  made from it. 
If I can get a live conversation, that's worth more than a list  of phone numbers. 
Fine. Then, after that, 
get Walid out of there. 
No. They're talking to him now. 
That's a big get. 
We have to keep listening in on whatever they say. 
This is Agent Samuels. 
I'm going to need to get into a cell tower grid location: 15 comma twenty-seven. 
It's done. 
All these people will come forward if we need them to testify? 
Yes. I put the screws 
to every one of them myself. 
They're all yours. 
Good. 
Oh, Karen... 
I need to talk to you. 
Just a minute. 
 Now would be better. 
Have this signed, and then send it out. 
This, uh, this just simply isn't working for me. 
I can't have you stand in my way anymore. 
What? 
I need the president's undivided attention, and you, frankly, are dividing it. 
Well, I'm not going to stop doing my job, Tom, just because it irritates you. 
I thought I made that  perfectly clear. 
Yeah. I'd like you to tend 
your resignation, Karen. 
(scoffs) My resignation? 
What are you smoking? 
No, no, no. I'm here 
to blow away all of the smoke. 
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence, and your covering it up. 
I don't like this conversation. 
What are you talking about? 
14 months ago, we had Abu Fayed in CTU custody in Seattle, and Bill Buchanan signed off on his release. 
I don't believe this. 
The case that you're referring to, if I remember correctly, involved over 20 detainees. 
Not prisoners, Tom. 
Detainees. 
And, at the time, there was not enough evidence to hold them. 
It's just a little grayer than that, now, isn't it? 
If what you're saying is true, how come that incident wound up blue-coded at Homeland in a dead-end file? 
I got Peter Iannone here, Kurt Hueig, Myra Mawk... 
They were all in the pipeline all ready to testify that you sequestered that file to protect your husband.  
I did nothing illegal or incorrect! 
Every single one of those detainees were cleared of any conspiracy charges. 
Nevertheless, one of these detainees detonated a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. 
You think your husband could survive that story? 
Or you, for that matter? 
Do you want to get in the ring with me, Tom? 
You've got skeletons in your closet, and I will not hesitate to pull them out. 
We've all got our skeletons, Karen. 
It's proof we don't all have. 
I've got mine. 
How long before you get yours? 
You're a son of a bitch. 
I never claimed otherwise. 
But I am not out to hurt you or your husband personally. 
I just need room to work. 
Your resignation within the hour. 
Can we go a little slower? 
There's no rush. 
Morris, I'm going as fast as I can. 
Why don't you just go back to your station? 
I'll send it over as soon as I'm ready. 
No, I'm curious as to why it's taking you five minutes to do something that should take ten seconds. 
Because I borrowed two of her processors to run a batch job. 
She's running on 20%. 
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't 
somebody tell me this? 
I just did. 
Fine. But don't 
keep any secrets from me, darling. 
We're on the same side. 
Why'd you lie for me? 
I talked to Buchanan. 
Yeah, it's pretty frustrating. 
I'm sure. 
What are you doing? 
I'm logging you in under my user I.D. 
That's illegal. 
And you didn't do it, I did. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, you should... 
be fine. 
(quiet conversation) Excuse me, Mr. President, 
I need to speak with you. 
Karen, I'm a little squeezed for time right now. 
Can we talk later? 
No, sir, we can't. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President, I am tendering 
my resignation, effective immediately. 
What's going on, Karen? 
It's a personal matter, sir. 
Is there something wrong with you or Bill? 
No, we're fine. 
It's... I cannot elaborate. 
I've noticed that you and Tom have been locking horns these past few weeks. 
Is that what this is about? 
Sir, I would rather not say. 
Damn it, Karen, that is unacceptable. 
Mr. President... 
I need you! 
I need different points of view. 
Now I understand it's difficult to sit in a room with someone who opposes you constantly, but that is part of your job. 
And I have never seen anyone handle it better than you. 
Now I am sorry, Karen, but I cannot accept your resignation. 
Not now, not today. 
No disrespect, sir, but you're going to have to. 
Mr. President, 
I'm here to tell you that the past few weeks have been some of the must difficult weeks that I have ever seen a president face. 
And I am truly honored to serve under you here in Washington. 
And I appreciate that you value my advice, but, sir, the truth is, you have been your own best counselor. 
You know what to do, sir. 
And I have no doubt, absolutely no doubt... 
that you will continue to rise to this challenge. 
Is there anything I can do to change your mind? 
No, sir, there is not. 
I would appreciate it, however, if you would reassign me to L.A. CTU. 
I feel I will serve best there. 
I'll approve you for military transport west. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr. President. 
I'm sorry. 
So am I. 
Oh. 
Oh. 
Excuse me, Karen, I'm so sorry. 
Oh, actually, Karen, I'm glad I caught you. 
I've got a State Department white paper I was hoping you could look over and then take to the president. 
No, you'll have to give it to Tom. 
Well, I thought you handled that. 
Give it to Tom. 
Excuse me. 
(phone ringing) Yes. 
Karen Hayes is out. 
The last one is a black Kia, California license plate Niner, Yankee, Sierra, Uniform, 1-0-8. 
That one's not registered to McCarthy either. 
Okay, I want you to cross-reference the names with registered owners, see if any of them correlate. 
What do you want me to do with the backup teams? 
Where are they? 
They're holding a two-block radius. 
Send one of them over to the parking lot here, tell the other to stand by. 
I'll get back to you. 
Where's McCarthy's office? 
What floor? 
Second floor. 
Let's go. 
You all right? 
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. 
All right, I've got the phone. 
Good. I'm going to give you 
a number to dial then CTU will be able to access the phone's records. 
After dialing the number, hit the star button twice. 
The number is 310-597-3781. 
Again, the number: 310-597-3781. 
Once we get everything off the SIM, I'll let you know, you can put the phone back. 
All right, but hurry. 
It won't be long before he discovers it's missing. 
He got the phone. 
There's nothing else he can do. 
Well, let's just see what we get. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Agent Samuels. 
We've got the phone. 
I'm piping a byte stream to you now. 
Work up every number you get. 
All right, it's coming through. 
What's it look like? 
This data's encoded. 
It looks like there's over 120 numbers or so. 
I can't tell if they're recently dialed or stored. 
I'll untangle it and get back to you in a few minutes. 
But you got everything, right? 
Yeah. 
Walid did a great job of getting that phone. 
Then please let him go before he gets hurt. 
I'm going to tell you one last time, Ms. Palmer 
these men know something about the bombs that we don't. 
Walid has earned their trust. 
That's a situation that we've lucked into. 
And we will not terminate it as long as he can continue to harvest information. 
All right, Walid, you can put the phone back. 
Okay. 
(phone rings) Yeah, Chloe. 
I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone. 
What are you talking about? 
They knew about the other four bombs. 
They found out from a web page. 
What? 
The cell phone had a browser on it. 
The cache had a web page. 
It wasn't public, but they could've connected in. 
Was the Web site password protected? 
No. These pages 
come and go. 
But a lot of people know about them. 
These guys aren't terrorists they're just spectators. 
Why didn't they report the Web site? 
Because you have them locked up for having terrorist links! 
Why would they give you information that, in your eyes, would incriminate them even further. 
All right, thanks, Chloe. 
I'm getting Walid the hell out of there. 
This is Agent Samuels. 
Notify the guards. 
We are taking Walid Al-Rezani out. 
I was at home with my wife and my children, and they barged right in and the grabbed me. 
No search warrant, nothing. 
And they say this country is about freedom. 
This is not freedom. 
My phone. 
It's gone. 
What do you mean it's gone? 
I just had it over there. 
You... You took it. 
No, I did not take your phone. 
Yes, he did. 
I was walking back here. 
He fell in front of me. 
Search him. 
No, get away from me. 
Open the gate. 
Can't do that, ma'am. 
I need to get in there right now. 
What are you doing? 
You spied on us? 
You're worse than they are! 
You son of a bitch! 
Heydar, no! 
(shouting) Let us in. 
(clamoring) Walid, Walid. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm okay. 
Oh, no, no, you're not. 
You're hurt. 
I need a medical team on site now. 
I've got a civilian down. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, we're here. 
The parking lot's almost empty. 
Yeah, the building's been evacuated because of the bomb. 
Does Jack want us in there? 
No, hold your positions. 
Keep an eye on all the exits and entrances; wait for my call. 
All right. Standing by. 
Which one's his office? 
Last door on the right. 
Let's go. 
Take a seat. 
What are you doing? 
I'm looking for anything in McCarthy's system that connects him to BXJ or the nukes. 
What's that? 
That's McCarthy's employment contract with BXJ. 
Whoa, whoa! What happened there? 
Some kind of electronic shredding trail. 
Look at the time code. 
Ten minutes after the bomb went off, McCarthy started shredding files. 
(door bangs) (whispers): Get up... now. 
Come on, Jack! 
Don't make a noise. 
(light tap) (louder tap) Don't you move. 
(grunts) Stop. 
You know him? 
Yeah. 
He's my son. 
I'm surprised to see you here, Jack. 
We all feared the worst. 
Give me my gun back. 
What are you doing here, Jack? 
I'm working with CTU. 
We're looking for Darren McCarthy. 
McCarthy's not here. 
I know what you're trying to cover up, Dad. 
Gray already told me. 
Did he? And where is he? 
McCarthy's office. 
There's nothing there, Jack, believe me. 
Get Graem in here. 
Wait. 
You'll need these. 
I didn't trust him not to run. 
I'm doing everything I can to find McCarthy. 
What in the hell are you thinking, trying to do this on your own? 
I only learned about it yesterday. 
When Graem told me about the diverted weapons... 
The second you knew the bombs were missing, why didn't you call the authorities? 
He told me that the bombs couldn't be detonated; the triggers were deactivated. 
He was wrong. 
Evidently! 
Look, Jack, I'm just trying to keep my son out of prison. 
Dad, where is McCarthy? 
I don't know. 
When I do, we can pick him up together. 
That's not what he wants, Dad. 
He wants us both in prison. 
What I want is to find the nukes. 
If you're held accountable for what you've done, that's the bed you've made. 
You hear that, Dad? 
You hear that family love? 
We'd be better off if he was still rotting away in a Chinese jail. 
Who are you calling? 
CTU. 
Jack, look, work with me. 
I'll tell you what I know, but for now, keep Graem out of it. 
We're talking about prison, Jack. 
He's your brother. 
Graem knew what he was doing was wrong. 
He was responsible for those nukes. 
He should have been more careful. 
And the second he knew they were stolen, he should have reported it! 
Oh, you always do what you should, right, Jack? 
How about when Dad needed you and you disappeared? 
Come on, Jack, give us a chance to clean this up. 
Dad, there are four more bombs out there. 
I cannot I will not be responsible for thousands and thousands of lives just to try and protect this family. 
Wrong! Protecting family is 
everything, and I think your dead wife would agree. 
You son of a bitch! 
Jack! 
All right, let's do it your way. 
No, Dad! 
No, no, no, he's right. 
Call CTU. 
I don't think so. 
Hey, what are you doing?! 
Put the gun away. 
You work for me. 
No, Dad, he doesn't. 
This is insane. 
You don't think I'd let you run loose without keeping an eye on you, do you? 
Tell them to put the guns away. 
Shut up, Dad. 
Well, I'm glad we can all finally put our cards on the table. 
Family. (scoffs) 
Let's go. 
Yeah, talk to me. 
Yeah, so? 
You think you can get him? 
And he hasn't left town? 
Okay, text me everything you've got on him. 
They're looking for you at your place. 
What makes you think they can't find you here? 
A: Because I'm not that stupid, and B: Because we're not going to be here long enough for anyone to know. 
I really hope you know what you're doing, Darren. 
Always. 
And when I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country. 
As long as it's not Palm Springs. 
Everything's been handled. 
We're clear to go. 
Good. Let's move. 
Good God. 
What have you done? 
Jack forced my hand. 
Call me when it's over.
