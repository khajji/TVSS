Congratulations, Tom. 
It's an excellent plan. 
It's about time someone in this administration stood up to these people. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. 
The American-Muslim community is our best line of defense against these terrorists. 
Your plan... 
would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop Fayed. 
I remain convinced that implementing this plan would be a terrible mistake. 
15 minutes ago, the NSA picked up a conversation between McCarthy and Fayed. 
McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes. 
CHLOE: Oh, my God. It's Morris. 
JACK: Morris, it's a setup. 
The engineer McCarthy's looking for-- it's you. 
(two gunshots) Get out of the car or the next one's in your head. 
We're on our way. 
We'll be waiting. 
With my money? 
FAYED: You'll get paid as soon as I have what I want. 
I'm just delivering him. 
You'll have to make him cooperate. 
How do I find McCarthy?! 
Four cc's! 
His vitals are spiking across the line. 
JACK: Four cc's! 
Jack, don't. 
It has nothing to do with McCarthy. 
It has to do with Palmer. 
David Palmer? 
I gave the order for his assassination. 
JACK: Not only was he responsible for David Palmer's assassination, he directed the entire conspiracy. 
He was trying to protect my father's company. 
Then... 
You told them about Palmer. 
I had to give them something, make them think I cracked, but I kept you out of it. 
Dad, stick to the plan. 
Sometimes you have to make adjustments. 
My son's had a seizure! 
PHILLIP: If you people killed my son, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I'm en route to the ambush site. 
You need to tell me which direction they took Morris. 
I'm bringing it up now. 
Jack, what are they gonna do to him? 
Chloe, they have to keep him alive long enough to try and make the bombs operational. 
That means we've got time. 
I need you to remain calm and pull up the satellite now. 
I'm trying; the server's not responding. 
That's 'cause you're not coordinates correctly. 
I know what I'm doing. 
Have you confirmed this with the field team? 
Yes. 
Jack's on line 1. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
We just got word from the field team at your brother's house. 
Graem's dead, Jack. 
What happened? 
We'll know more after an autopsy, but all signs point to cardiac arrest. 
Because of the interrogation. 
The medic on site believes that was a factor. 
My father know? 
Yes, he was there. 
But your sister-in-law and nephew were already en route to CTU when it happened. 
Bill, I'd really appreciate it if you would be the one to break the news to her. 
Of course, Jack. 
Sir. 
Stand by. 
Chloe's starting to screw up. 
She's worried about Morris. 
I think she's losing it. 
Chloe, have you accessed the uplink yet? 
Not yet. 
Listen, I know what you must be feeling, but if there's a problem... 
Get away from me! 
There's not a problem! 
The only problem is people like you bothering me when I'm trying to do my job. 
Chloe, give up your post to Milo. 
Leave me alone; I can do this! 
Now. 
Fine. 
Jack, I've had to relieve Chloe. 
She's too distraught to function. 
You're on with Milo. 
Jack, just give me a second. 
Okay, I got McCarthy on satellite 13 minutes ago, abducting Morris in a silver Maserati at the corner of Central and Third. 
I'm tracking them to their current position. 
All right, right now McCarthy's at Adams and 13th, heading west. 
Copy that. 
We should have a visual in the next couple minutes. 
How long is it gonna take the TAC teams to intercept McCarthy on the ground? 
I don't know. 
We'll get back to you. 
Where are we taking him? 
Fayed will call soon. 
Just relax. Drive. 
I am relaxed. 
I just want to get this over with. 
It's never gonna be over. 
CTU knows who you are. 
They're already looking for you. 
Shut up. 
Is that possible? 
Don't listen to him. 
He's bluffing. 
So you're not Darren McCarthy, arms dealer, subcontracted by BXJ Technologies. 
CTU intercepted a transmission about Fayed hiring you to do this. 
I said shut up! 
Right. 
We're handing him over to Fayed as planned. 
If I'm already a marked man, might as well get paid for it. 
What about me? 
He didn't say they know about you. 
And anyway, I'll take care of you, like always. 
(helicopter whirring overhead) Chopper? 
That's a chopper. 
I got him. I got him. 
We got a visual. 
Turn left. 
But why... 
Just do what I say! 
Just do it! 
Swing back. 
JACK: They just took off. 
They must have spotted us. 
All right, I got them turning north onto Anders. 
Go around them. 
I, uh... 
Go around them! 
What?! 
Just do it! 
No! 
Oh, my God. 
Are they still there? 
Yes. 
Turn there! 
We got a problem up here. 
They're headed to the 110 interchange. 
Damn it. We just lost them. 
Does CalTrans have any cameras that are covering that area? 
No. 
Nothing. 
TAC team is still five minutes away. 
Captain, I want you to put me down now. 
Do you know what this is about? 
Fayed, the man you're taking me to, is the terrorist who set off the nuclear bomb in Valencia. 
He has four more bombs. 
But he needs me to make them work, so that he can kill tens of thousands of innocent people. 
And all you have to do to stop that from happening is to uncuff me. 
McCarthy's right. 
CTU doesn't know you exist. 
For the love of God, all of those people's lives are on you. 
Let's go. 
Shouldn't I get my luggage? 
Forget about the luggage! 
Come on! 
You did not tell me this is about nuclear bombs. 
What this is about is about $7 million. 
Now, get in the truck! 
MILO: Pressman. 
They dumped the car. 
They must have switched vehicles. 
From the underpass, they could've merged directly onto any one of six local roads or highways. 
There's no way of tracking them without knowing exactly what vehicle they're in. 
Damn it, Milo. 
They could be anywhere! 
The TAC team's here. 
Get back to me. 
Head south. 
I'm sorry. 
Hello. 
I have a new place for us to meet. 
Are you certain you're not being followed? 
Yeah. 
What's the address? 
4332 Florence Avenue, apartment 621. 
Have you got my money? 
Yes. 
Turn on the GPS. 
Apartment 621. 
All right? 
Don't forget it. 
Okay, good. 
It's not too far. 
Yes, yes. 
Thank God. 
A bit excessive, but you did the right thing. 
Now I've got to contact CTU and give them... 
Shut up! 
Shut up! 
Fayed wants you alive, and whatever shape you're in beyond that is up to you. 
Oh, come on. What are you doing? 
I am making $7 million. 
And I can spend it without having to worry about CTU. 
Listen... 
I know you think I'm wrong, and that I blindsided you by not backing your proposals. 
Correct on both counts, sir. 
Tom, I have always valued your counsel. 
Ever since you showed up at my home and convinced me to run, spearheaded my campaign. 
I mean, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here. 
But I do hope I can still count on you to help me implement my polices. 
AGENT DAN: Excuse me, Mr. President. 
The plane carrying Hamri Al-Assad has landed at Andrews Air Force Base. 
He'll be here soon. 
Thank you. 
We'll talk later. 
(knocking) Mr. Lennox? 
Uh... 
Everything's okay. 
We're fine in here. Thank you. 
What happened? 
The President just rejected every one of my proposals right there in front of the Cabinet. 
Not only has he changed his mind on the internment plan, he is rolling back on the detention facilities that are already in place. 
I thought... I thought 
he was on board. 
Well, so did I. 
Now he's putting forth his own agenda to try and appease the Muslim population. 
Is he hoping that they're going to cooperate and help find the nuclear weapons? 
That's it! That's it! 
And all he will succeed in doing is to prove to the terrorists that he does not have the stomach to do what is necessary and inevitable. 
Okay. Then you need to use your 
influence to change his mind. 
My...? 
My influence? 
You don't get it, do you, Reed? 
I have no influence. 
Not here. 
Not in this administration. 
No, I'm resigning. 
Sir, that would be a terrible mistake. 
My mistake was to believe that Wayne Palmer has the courage and the vision to fill this office. 
Clearly, I overestimated him. 
He is certainly not his brother. 
Which makes it all the more important that you stay. 
Sir, you have the support of a great many people here, the least of which is the Vice President. 
Well, unfortunately, the Vice President is not the one in power. 
And this country is being led to slaughter by the man who is. 
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. 
I can't, in good conscience, be party to this. I can't. 
Sir, sir, this is a terrible mistake. 
Reed, I cannot talk about this any further. 
Go now and draft my letter of resignation and bring it to me now for me to sign. 
Yes, sir. 
CARSON: Yes? 
Yeah, it's Reed. 
Palmer just shot down the Lennox plan in the Cabinet meeting. 
He's rejecting every one of the initiatives. 
Did you hear what I said? 
I heard. 
Looks like we have no choice. 
We'll have to move ahead with what we all talked about. 
I realize it's extreme, but under the circumstances, I don't see any alternative. 
Do you? 
No. But there's a problem. 
Tom Lennox is resigning. 
When? 
As soon as I write his letter of resignation. 
Carson, if he goes, I lose my job. 
And I lose my access. 
Our plan is contingent on your proximity to the President. 
We need you in place. 
I know, I am very well aware of that, but Tom Lennox is determined to quit. 
He might reconsider if he knew what was coming. 
I suppose I could feel him out. 
Then do it, carefully. 
We have to protect ourselves. 
Has anything turned up on CalTrans? 
Without knowing what vehicle McCarthy switched in to, it's going to take hours to scan through frame grabs. 
Stay on it. Right now, 
it's all we've got. 
Mrs. Bauer. 
Yes? 
I'm Bill Buchanan, Director of Operations. 
You must be Josh. 
May I speak with you a moment? 
Privately. 
Um... 
It's okay, Mom. 
Okay. 
What is it? 
I'm very sorry to have to tell you. 
Your husband is dead. 
How? 
He appears to have suffered a heart attack. 
What did Jack do to him? 
I assure you there'll be a thorough investigation. 
Your father-in-law is accompanying Graem's body here for an autopsy. 
Unless you have an objection. 
No. 
I have to tell my son. 
Of course. 
Josh. 
Your mother wants to speak with you. 
MARILYN: He had a heart attack. 
He died. 
JOSH: What? No. 
Pressman. 
It's Jack. 
Let me speak to Buchanan. 
Hold on. 
Sir... Jack's on the line. 
Jack? 
Bill, we found McCarthy's body less than three blocks away from the interchange. 
We intercepted a call from LAPD. 
The witness said the shooter was a female, drove off with a male fitting Morris's description in a silver pickup. 
Did the witness get a license plate? 
No. But McCarthy 
received a call just about five minutes ago. 
The caller ID is blocked. 
I need you to trace the source of the call. 
You think the call came from Fayed? 
Yeah. 
I'll give it to Milo as soon as you upload the phone's data. 
It's on its way. 
Knock. 
MAN: What do you want? 
I'm Darren McCarthy's associate. 
I've got your package. 
Who are you? 
Where's McCarthy? 
He's waiting to hear from me. 
If he doesn't get the money, he gives you up. 
This is the engineer? 
Look, this... I don't know 
what you're talking about. 
I-I'm just a data analyst. 
You've got the wrong man. 
Look... 
I've brought you what you want. 
Just give me the money, and I'll go. 
You'll get your money when this man completes his task. 
You work at CTU, so you know I have four nuclear suitcase bombs in my possession. 
You may also know these bombs need to be reprogrammed before I can use them. 
You are here to create a device that will allow me to do so. 
(quivering): Well, not bloody likely, mate. 
You're going to modify this so that I can use it to reprogram the bombs. 
(inhales deeply): No, I'm not. 
Bill, what's happening with the phone trace? 
BUCHANAN: Milo's still working on it, Jack. 
What is it taking so long? 
Checking into it now. 
Milo... 
what's your status? 
All I've got is that the call was made from a landline. 
But the number was routed through at least a dozen different servers, and they keep cycling back on each other. 
(bangs table): Come on! 
Are you going to be able to do this? 
CHLOE: Milo. 
Let me try. 
I know I screwed up earlier. 
I wasn't thinking clearly, but let me try this. 
I need to. 
All right. 
The number strings are caught in a loop matrix. 
CHLOE: Did you try running a SatCom overlay filter? 
That only works on cell-to-cell communication. 
This call was placed from a hardline. 
NSA recently started using satellite carrier systems as a backup for all phone traffic. 
You just have to reconfigure the embedded decryption program to... Got it. 
That's it. 
All right. 
McCarthy's call was made from an apartment building: 4332 Florence Avenue. 
Did you copy that, Jack? 
Yeah, do we know which apartment? 
No, there's no way to tell; they tapped directly into the building's trunk line. 
Our men are ready to move. 
Have tactical meet us over there. 
Tell them to set up a perimeter. 
Stay out of sight. 
Understood. 
Good work, Milo. 
Sir, it wasn't me. 
If you think she's ready, bring her back in. 
Mr. Al-Assad... 
right this way. 
I've checked out your background. 
And despite my understandable skepticism, I do believe you're serious about wanting this negotiated peace. 
On my own terms, yes. 
Let's table your terms for the time being while we discuss mine. 
My country, sir... 
has suffered a nuclear attack by the very same terrorists who used to follow you. 
Thousands of innocent Americans are dead or dying as we speak. 
I'm aware of the tragedy in California, Mr. President. 
I was there. 
Then you understand, that if Fayed successfully detonates any more nuclear weapons on US soil, there will be no chance whatsoever for a peace agreement. 
The American people are demanding that we strike back. 
And not just at organizations such as yours, but at the governments that support them. 
Now, if just one more nuke goes off, one more, we won't have a choice. 
You understand me? 
We're talking about war. 
You don't have to tell me what is at stake, but I still don't understand what you want from me. 
I would like you to appear on television and make a public address to the world. 
Declare your intentions for peace, and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere to come forward with any information regarding Fayed. 
You flatter me if you think I hold sway over all Islam. 
No, sir, not all. 
Just the extremists who share your hatred of the West. 
I certainly can't reach out to them for help, but I know you can. 
But perception is everything, Mr. President. 
So I must present my agenda to my own people in my own time, not by appearing on American television from The White House. 
Fayed has already called me a traitor, and many others will follow him if there is even a suspicion that I am an American puppet. 
Not a puppet, a partner, at least when it comes to finding these nuclear weapons. 
Now, that's what we have to be for your peace initiative to have any chance of working, so get used to it! 
Now, between you and me, sir, I really don't give a damn how and when you wanted to present your agenda; the time is now. 
You want to lead this peace initiative... 
then lead. 
Who's in command? 
Agent Turner. 
Agent Turner, what's the status of your perimeter? 
It's in place. 
We've got agents in plainclothes covering the exits to the building, and we have three TAC teams in position to move in on your command. 
Do you have confirmation that Fayed's in the building? 
Not directly, but the building manager ID'd Morris O'Brian entering the building with a woman less than 20 minutes ago. 
We assume the woman is the driver your witness saw shoot McCarthy. 
There are no cameras in the building. 
We don't know what apartment or floor they're on. 
CTU is patched in and awaiting your word. 
Thank you. 
Turn it on. 
Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy? 
Yes, Jack. Go ahead. 
I'm at the staging area. 
We have a confirmation that Morris is inside the building. 
We do not have confirmation on Fayed. 
There are no cameras in the building. 
Do have infrared satellite? 
We can't get a live feed, but we do have a satellite in position uploading images at five-minute intervals. 
The latest scan shows 215 people in the building, spread out over six floors and 112 apartments. 
It's going to take too long to go room by room. 
We're going to have to figure out another way ID them. 
Is this building on the city's emergency services grid? 
Yes, Jack. All buildings over 
ten units are required to. 
Chloe, it's good to have you back. 
I'm to need you to get into their system, and trigger an all-building fire alarm. 
Okay, we just have to get past their log-in screen. 
Let me know when you're ready. 
Agent. 
Please... 
please, stop. 
Just indicate you'll do what I've asked, and we will stop. 
People are leaving the building. 
There really is a fire. 
What do we do? 
There's no fire. 
CTU knows we're here. 
I really need to get out of here. 
Shut up! 
Up against the wall. 
Your time is up! 
I will use this all over your body until you die of shock or blood loss. 
Then I'll just find someone else to do what I need. 
Do you understand? 
Look, please... 
I don't care about the money. 
I made a mistake. 
Just let me get out of here. 
Please. 
So, you give up the seven million, huh? 
Yes. 
Okay. 
Oh! 
Stop... stop! 
I'll do it. 
Come in. 
This memo says Palmer's arranging for Assad to make a televised statement. 
I heard. 
Not only are we providing free airtime to a mass murderer and a vowed enemy of democracy, we are proving terrorism works. 
You have my letter of resignation? 
No, sir, I don't. 
Why not? 
Because you can't resign while this country is being brought to the brink of a nuclear holocaust by a weak, misguided President. 
Damn it, Reed. I explained... 
I cannot get the President to budge on policy. 
There's nothing I can do about this. 
What if I told you that the climate could change? 
What does that even mean, the climate? 
Well, I'm just saying that there are people who believe, like you, that more aggressive steps need to be taken to crack down on terrorism, both here at home and abroad, and that a change in leadership is imperative to ensure this nation's security. 
Um... 
Who? 
Excuse me, sir? 
Who are these like-minded people we're talking about? 
I was... I'm just 
speaking abstractly. 
But you'd have to agree that, uh... 
your plan would have all the support it needed if the Vice President were the man occupying the Oval Office. 
Wait... 
Now, I may dislike the President's current course of action. 
I hardly think it warrants his, his removal. 
I'm not talking about holding hearings. 
Something more immediate would have to happen. 
Oh, my God... 
You can't possibly be intimating what I think you are. 
I'm not intimating anything. 
I'm just simply musing. 
Careful. 
That kind of musing can get you thrown into prison for treason. 
Well, I'm sorry, sir, that you've misunderstood me. 
Yeah, I certainly hope so, for your sake. 
All right. 
I think you have a letter to draft for me. 
FIREFIGHTER (on bullhorn): You need to keep a safe distance away from the building until we have determined there is no danger. 
Please move across the street away from the building. 
Anything from your men on the ground? 
They've looked at everyone who's exited the building. 
There's no sign of Fayed or O'Brian. 
If they were inside when the alarm went off, they're still in there. 
Damn it. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, it's Bill. 
Go ahead. 
We've got the latest infrared. 
We're mirroring it to your screen. 
Hold on. 
I've got it. 
I'm looking at it now. 
Okay, there's three people left in the apartments on the second, fourth and sixth floors. 
We need to narrow that down. 
Chloe, who's renting those apartments? 
Superimposing building department schematics and cross-referencing with phone company and police records now. 
Okay, the woman on the second floor is handicapped. 
She probably didn't leave because she can't. 
The other two apartments are occupied by single males; the man on the fourth floor has been arrested several times for distribution of narcotics. 
Fayed wouldn't use anyone with a criminal record to set up a safe house. 
Our hostiles are in the sixth floor apartment. 
Get your men ready. 
We're moving in. 
All right, let's go! 
How much longer? 
I don't know. 
McCarthy said this is a few minutes' work for an advanced programmer. 
You're stalling for time. 
I am not. 
It'll be ready in a minute. 
Most everybody seems to have evacuated the building. 
Which is how they intend to find us. 
At this point it's only a question of time. 
Go. 
It's done? 
Yes. 
Bring it. 
You have the bombs here? 
Just one. 
Let's see if you did your work correctly. 
Arm it. 
Arm it! 
Very good. 
Kill him. 
Please, I did what you asked, didn't I? 
Now. 
All agents sound off! 
Clear. 
AGENT: We're clear. 
We took a head count of the bodies. 
One hostile's missing; we haven't found Fayed. 
It's clear, sir. 
Have your men maintain the search for Fayed. 
I want them to identify every possible exit from this apartment. 
Yes, sir. 
What's his status? 
Unconscious, but alive. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Morris has been injured, but he's alive. 
Mr. Bauer, you need to see this. 
(into earpiece): CTU, this is Bauer. 
Jack, be careful. 
The bomb has a fail-safe device that prevents any forced entry. 
Through the glass casing I have two small metal plates slowly converging on each other. 
Those are the trigger plates, Jack; once they touch an electrical charge will detonate the core causing the nuke to explode. 
How far apart are they? 
Approximately three inches. 
Okay, that gives us only about three minutes. 
There's a small metal box to the right of it. 
You need to carefully unscrew the top of it. 
Copy that. 
AGENT TURNER: Agent Bauer, we know how Fayed got out. 
They opened up a wall in one of the closets to get access to the building's ventilation system. 
From there, Fayed could get to the basement, and, in turn, the sewer tunnels. 
Did you mobilize your teams and set up a perimeter? 
Yes, sir. But we believe 
Fayed's already gone. 
Witnesses report a helicopter taking off from a nearby field a few minutes ago. 
It appeared to be a medical evac chopper, so it got through our net. 
Damn it. 
The top's off. 
Come on, Chloe. 
We are running out of time. 
Okay, under the gears you should see four wires. 
Short-circuit each of them. 
That should stop the left gear from rotating. 
You can access the dip switches underneath it to open the case and manually stop the trigger. 
Okay, the left gear stopped moving. 
I see the dip switches. 
They're all in the up position. 
What's next? 
Um... 
Switch three and four to the down position. 
Nothing happened. 
The case didn't open. 
It didn't? 
That's what I said. 
It didn't open. 
Hold on. 
(bomb buzzing) Chloe, we are almost out of time. 
Okay, I have an updated schematic. 
It wasn't switches three and four. 
You need to push four and five to the down position, and the cover will open. 
Are you sure this time? 
I'm about as sure as I'm going to be before this bomb goes off. 
It's done. 
The bomb is disarmed. 
Notify your men the bomb's been deactivated. 
It's over. 
MORRIS: It's not over. 
What are you talking about? 
The reprogramming device that Fayed had me build for him. 
If it's not here, it means he took it with him. 
And with it, he can activate the other bombs he has anytime he wants. 
You gave him something that worked? 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
CTU, did you copy that? 
BUCHANAN: We got it, Jack. 
Alert the President immediately. 
Organize two teams: one to search the apartment, one to search around the building. 
Agent O'Brian will tell you what you're looking for. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
You see this flash report in from CTU? 
I'm reading it now. 
They let Fayed slip through their fingers... again. 
Apparently he now has the capability to arm these remaining suitcase nukes. 
This situation is immeasurably worse. 
You know my letter of resignation? 
Have you got that? 
Yes, I just, uh... 
I just finished printing it. 
I can bring it over to you right now. 
No, no, no. 
No, just tear that up. 
What? 
Um... 
That talk we were having in my office, I don't think I misunderstood you. 
And I... 
would like to discuss this... further. 
Not on this phone. 
I'll let you know when I have a secure location.
