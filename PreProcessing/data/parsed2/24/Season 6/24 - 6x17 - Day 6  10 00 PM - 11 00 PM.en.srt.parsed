Fayed has the bombs. 
Where is he? 
I don't know, but I can help you find him. 
RYAN: Preparing the tracker now. 
We can track the isotope signature up to 15 miles. 
(inhales sharply) MILO: We are locked on the isotope signature that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm. 
You led them to me. 
I had no choice. 
I don't like it. 
Something's wrong. 
I'm heading in. 
Which direction, Milo? 
He stopped and entered the building on the left. 
He's right on the other side of the door! 
Oh, my God. 
He cut off Gredenko's arm! 
Ryan, move your men in now! 
I want Fayed alive! 
REPORTER: But sources indicate that the same terrorist cell is most likely... 
We're trapped. 
This way. 
I recognize him from the news! 
He's the terrorist they're looking for! 
MAN: Thatis him! 
You bastard. 
Back off! 
Gredenko is not here. 
I need you to lock down the area and initiate a search! 
One of the Cabinet votes is invalid. 
The tally's seven to six in favor of invoking the 25th amendment and removing President Palmer from power. 
I'm sorry, Wayne. 
No, don't waste your apologies on me because I won't let you steal the presidency. 
As I'm sure you're aware, sir, conspiracy to commit perjury is a felony offense. 
LISA: My affidavit will push the court to rule in your favor so that you can do what's right for this country. 
NOAH: You're right. Do it. 
Turn it off. 
Wayne, the Supreme Court was just notified. 
Daniels withdrew his suit. 
You're still the President of the United States. 
President Palmer... 
What? 
He's about to go ahead with the nuclear strike. 
This makes no sense, sir! 
It's what you risked your life to stop! 
Tom, I risked my life to reassert my authority. 
Mr. President... 
...we have a successful launch. 
Good. 
Mr. President, 
the missile is just entering target's airspace. 
Mr. President... 
Tom, I said I was done talking. 
We both agreed a nuclear strike is pointless, Fayed's actions are not state-sponsored and his country cannot be held accountable for this. 
Five minutes till impact. 
The ambassador assured us he country is doing everything possible to find those suitcase nukes. 
They simply don't know anything! 
Well, one way or another, Tom, we're about to find out if that's true. 
(keypad beeps, phone rings on line) Buchanan. 
HAYES: Bill, it's me. 
Have you gotten anything from Fayed? 
Jack's interrogating him now, but frankly, he's not optimistic about breaking him. 
What's going on? 
The president's gone ahead with the missile strike. 
He what? 
He's launched it, Bill. 
Why? 
I don't know why. 
He fought the vice president to regain his office, and now he's just going ahead with Daniels' plan. 
It doesn't make any sense. 
We've got to stop this. 
Look, can I tell the president that you have a solid lead from Fayed on the location of the suitcase nukes? 
If you're asking me to provide a pretext to bring the missile down, Karen, I can't do that. 
Fayed's not talking and Gredenko's dead. 
I don't have anything. 
Okay, okay. 
I'm sorry. 
Me, too. 
I'll call you later. 
Sir, we have confirmation the radar's tagged the missile. 
They're scrambling fighters and readying air defenses, sir. 
Then they know we're coming. 
Good. 
Sir, I just got off the phone with CTU. 
Bauer's interrogating Fayed. 
It's just a matter of time before he has the location of those bombs. 
No, Karen, we can't afford to wait longer. 
Sir, we can't afford not to. 
Please, why are you doing this? 
Four minutes to impact, Mr. President. 
Mr. President... 
(intercom beeps) Yes? 
Excuse me. We have the 
ambassador on for the President. 
This is President Palmer. 
Mr. President, my government 
has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country. 
That's correct, Mr. Ambassador. 
We've made good on our threat. 
For God sake, I implore you to stop it! 
On what grounds? 
We have uncovered new information regarding your situation. 
I'm listening. 
We've identified a general in our Central Command, General Mohmar Habib, who has also been in contact with Fayed. 
It's our belief that he's been helping orchestrate the attacks on your country. 
Have you arrested Habib? 
Yes, yes. He's being 
interrogated as we speak. 
Please, you must abort this attack before it's too late. 
Does Habib know the present location of Fayed's nuclear weapons? 
It is my understanding that the general's last contact with Fayed was during the drone operation. 
He has no current knowledge of the weapon's whereabouts or their intended targets. 
Mr. President, 
two minutes to impact, sir. 
Ambassador, your government has known about this man for quite some time, haven't they? 
Mr. President, this  
development has come as a shock... 
Stop lying to me! 
That missile will hit in less than two minutes, Mr. Ambassador, 
so please don't try my patience again. 
You must understand the fragile political climate of our country. 
General Habib is a high-ranking military commander. 
I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of World War III. 
The missile will be aborted, Mr. Ambassador. 
But in the meantime, I strongly suggest you get me a full  dossier on General Habib. 
I want a thorough update on the progress of his interrogation. 
I'm also demanding that you return here to the White House immediately. 
I want direct access to you, sir, for the duration of this crisis. 
As you wish, Mr. President. 
Commander, abort code: Alpha-Zero-Delta-Nine. 
Ditch it in the Gulf. 
My God, they were lying to us all the time. 
Withholding information and you knew it. 
I suspected it. 
Well, I'll see that theVickery sends a recovery team to retrieve that nuclear warhead. 
That won't be necessary, Tom. 
The president ordered the launch of a secondary missile on board theVickery, an unarmed one. 
HAYES: What? 
This was all a bluff? 
The vice president was right. 
Well, about one thing, anyway. 
That it was going to take a willingness to strike back before getting any real cooperation from their government. 
The difference is I wasn't about to take innocent lives to prove my point. 
Now let's get this information to CTU. 
Perhaps it's the key to breaking Fayed. 
(grunts) Gah! 
This country is planning a full retaliatory strike against your people. 
Now, I can stop it, but tell me where the bombs are. 
Where are the bombs?! 
Fayed, this is over. 
You lost. 
Save your people. 
Just tell me where the bombs are. 
Are you enjoying yourself, Bauer? 
As much as you enjoyed butchering my little brother? 
Your brother was responsible for the death of dozens of innocent lives. 
Now you're responsible for thousands. 
Trust me, I haven't begun to enjoy myself. 
Go ahead. 
You'll get nothing from me, and you know it. 
We'll see. 
(gasps) (coughing) (whispering): This is not working. 
Let me have a go at him. 
No. That's exactly 
what he wants. 
He knows he's lost. 
He wants us to martyr him. 
(cell phone ringing) Hold on. 
This is Bauer. 
BUCHANAN: Jack, it's Bill. 
What's your status with Fayed? 
Same as before. 
We're getting nowhere. 
I just got some new intel from the White House. 
Fayed's government arrested one of its generals Mohmar Habib. 
Apparently, he's been running Fayed, helping him coordinate the attacks. 
Then Habib would know where Fayed's men are. 
Unfortunately not. 
He claims there's been no contact since the failed drone attack. 
They're interrogating him now. 
Well, unless Habib's going to give us something more useful than that, we still have no location for these bombs. 
We have to try something more drastic. 
How soon can you have Fayed ready for transport? 
Immediately, but... 
You really think you're going to be remembered as some great martyr for your people, Fayed? 
Yeah, you blew up a little city, and you killed a lot of people today. 
But let's face it, that's going to be of no real political significance. 
Let me tell you what's going to happen. 
Your number two guy, once he realizes that you're out of the picture, he's going to take those remaining suitcase nukes, and he's going to blow up a substantial target, something that's really going to hurt this country. 
And if, by some chance, he succeeds, he's going to be the hero of your jihad, and you will be forgotten. 
Is that what you want? 
(scoffs) Do you honestly believe you can manipulate me by playing on my vanity? 
I serve the will of God. 
No, you don't. 
And if you don't believe me, ask him when you meet him. 
(cocks gun) Agent Doyle, lower your weapon. 
I said lower your weapon! 
Buchanan wants us to transport Fayed back to CTU. 
We don't have time. 
His men are probably on the move. 
The only way we're going to break him is with a pharmaceutical package. 
Burke is standing by. 
We don't need Burke. 
Just give me some time with him. 
Those are your orders. 
Agent Doyle, do you have a problem? 
No problem. 
Good. 
Get your men ready. 
LENNOX: Excuse me, sir. 
Here's the file on Habib. 
Is this the complete dossier on General Habib? 
No, sir. 
That's preliminary. 
And I was told by the ambassador's staff that more will be forthcoming and will be relayed concurrently to CTU. 
Good. 
How soon before the ambassador gets here? 
Within 15 minutes. 
Oh, and I spoke with Secret Service. 
They said your sister is on her way back to the hospital to be with Walid. 
And she's going to call you soon. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
I did want to say, your handling of the crisis... 
Tom, I know that you're not happy that you were kept in the dark about the bluff. 
But the Joint Chiefs and I agreed to keep the plan closed. 
That's not it. 
I just want to say I'm sorry... 
I doubted your strength and your leadership. 
It's all right. 
Well, respectfully, sir, no... 
it's not all right. 
Tom... 
you and I go back a long time, so let's be honest with each other. 
You made it no secret that you believed the vice president was better suited to lead this country through this crisis. 
And I was wrong about that, sir. 
No, if that missile had detonated on foreign soil... 
Russia, China, every nation with a nuclear capability might well have inserted themselves into this. 
No, this could have been a world war. 
Unfortunately, we're already in a world war, Tom. 
It's just taken me some time to fully realize that. 
If it hadn't have been for Vice President Daniels initiating that missile launch, I would have no gambit to play here. 
And the ambassador would never have come forward with this intel on Habib. 
I'm not David, Tom. 
And I never will be. 
But I am learning that who I am is not so bad. 
Yeah, well, we're all doing some learning here today, aren't we, sir? 
Tom? 
Daniels withdrew his challenge to my competency very suddenly. 
And from what I know, without any discernible reason. 
Change of heart maybe. 
Oh, something must have changed it. 
You have something on him, don't you? 
Sir, as chief of staff, I'm here to inform you and also to protect you. 
Those jobs don't always work in combination. 
JACK: We're northbound on Washington. 
ETA about 16 minutes. 
Tell Agent Burke we're going to need everything he's got. 
Jack, what if this doesn't work? 
I've never found pharmaceutical torture all that effective. 
I have. 
If this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time. 
I won't tell you a thing. 
Whether you do or not, I get to watch you suffer. 
Agent Doyle, I don't want you talking... 
Jack! 
Watch out! 
(tires screech) Everybody okay?! 
DOYLE: Yeah. 
They're trying to flank us on both sides. 
We're sitting ducks here. 
Try and get Fayed out the back. 
I'll cover you from this side. 
DOYLE: All right. 
(automatic gunfire) (speaking Arabic) (yelling in Arabic) We're clear. 
We're clear. 
Bill, it's Jack, do you copy? 
Bill, do you copy? 
We're here, Jack. 
The cover team just picked up Fayed. 
You think he bought it? 
We'll know soon enough. 
JACK: Is the A/V feed up yet? 
We're almost there. 
Agent Doyle, you're bleeding. 
Oh, must have cut myself in the crash. 
Mike, do you need medical assistance? 
DOYLE: Uh, negative, it's superficial, but thanks for your concern. 
Jack, I'm patching it through to you now. 
JACK: Copy that. 
JAMAL: Talit, take evasive measures. 
Keep off the main streets. 
(speaking Arabic) My name is Jamal Nasawa. 
We are with the Al-Tahireen cell. 
General Habib sent us. 
The general? 
Yes. 
How did you find me? 
Through contacts the general has within the American intelligence community. 
He learned of your route and ordered us to intercept. 
He wants us to help you rendezvous with your men. 
(breathing heavily) Give me a gun. 
(speaks softly) I want to speak to him. 
General Habib. 
That's not possible at the moment. 
Why not? 
The general is under tight scrutiny by the government. 
It's not safe. 
He said he'll call us when he can. 
Fayed, where do you want us to take you? 
I'll let you know after I speak to the general. 
As you wish. 
Bill, did you copy that? 
Fayed's not going anywhere unless he talks to General Habib. 
I don't know if I can make that happen, Jack. 
We've got to make that happen. 
Otherwise, this play is going to fall through. 
We have no other way to find the bombs. 
I'll call the White House. 
I've got Bill Buchanan on the phone. 
I'm patching him through. 
Bill, you're on speaker with Tom Lennox and myself. 
So what's the situation? 
Jack Bauer wasn't able to extract any information from Fayed. 
He considered it a dead end. 
Consequently, we implemented a plan intended to trick Fayed into leading us to the location of the suitcase nukes. 
What sort of plan? 
We staged a fake rescue of Fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib. 
We hoped that Fayed would lead us to wherever his men are holed up. 
But he hasn't, right? 
No, sir. 
Fayed is stalling until he can get confirmation from Habib that these men are taking orders from him. 
He wants to speak to the general, sir. 
Habib is still being interrogated, Bill. 
We don't yet know how cooperative he's being or even if he will be. 
I appreciate that, sir. 
Our agents on the inside are trying to circumvent Fayed's request, but Jack believes Fayed will not lead us to the location of the nukes unless he speaks directly to the general. 
Where's the ambassador now? 
He arrived a few minutes ago. 
Karen Hayes is meeting him in the lounge. 
All right. 
I'll do my best to put pressure on the ambassador, Bill. 
Maybe they can force Habib to make that call. 
Keep doing what you can on your end just in case I'm not successful. 
Yes, sir, we'll keep you apprised. 
All right. 
You know, sir, if this ruse isn't working, our time might be better served getting the information out of Fayed by more conventional means. 
Tom, if Jack Bauer says that's a dead end, then it's a dead end, and I believe him. 
Let's not keep the ambassador waiting. 
Oh! Are you all 
right, sir? 
I'm fine. 
Ambassador. 
Mr. President. 
The Prime Minister has asked me to convey his gratitude to you for stopping the attack on our country and his relief that an international catastrophe was narrowly avoided. 
Well, don't get too comfortable, Mr. Ambassador, 
because there may be one yet. 
Sit down. 
Let me get right to the point. 
At this very moment, Abu Fayed is traveling with a team of CTU agents posing as a terrorist cell allied with General Habib. 
You have Fayed? 
Yeah, we do, but we don't have the suitcase nukes. 
The problem is Fayed will not rendezvous with his men until he speaks to that general, presumably to confirm the legitimacy of our undercover agents. 
So we need that phone call to take place now. 
I appreciate your dilemma, Mr. President, 
and I will gladly pass on your request. 
But I'm not sure the general would be accommodating. 
He's proven to be quite stubborn throughout his interrogation. 
Well, perhaps you should be a little bit more persuasive. 
I resent your tone. 
I don't need you to tell me how dire the situation is. 
This is not a moment for your indignation, considering it's your country's own inactions that have brought us to this point. 
I can assure you, every effort is being made to get information from him. 
We have even arrested his family. 
Have you threatened to kill them? 
I beg your pardon? 
Mr. President... 
These are desperate times for us, Mr. Ambassador. 
I spared your country a nuclear strike that would have killed thousands. 
What is your country willing to do to insure that another bomb does not go off in mine? 
What you're suggesting is barbaric. 
I'm fully aware of how your country treats political dissidents. 
So don't you dare speak to me of barbarism. 
Now I don't care how you do it, but General Habib needs to call Fayed and give him his orders directly without compromising CTU's operation. 
You'll make the call now. 
Nadia... 
if General Habib makes the call, it'll be to Jamal's phone, but the general doesn't speak English. 
I'll set up a separate channel and translate their conversation. 
Milo, I need you to uplink a proprietary channel on socket D to my terminal. 
I can't. I'm busy. 
Why don't you just do it yourself? 
Because I don't have level five security clearance. 
Hasn't stopped you before, now, has it? 
Milo, is there something on your mind? 
I just don't get it. 
A few hours ago, Doyle was threatening you, hurting you. 
You were barely talking to me and now, what, you two are best buddies? 
Just because I showed concern for an injured field agent Concern...? 
doesn't make us friends. 
Milo, besides, he might not as bad as you think he is. 
No. He is. 
The guy is a creep and a sadist. 
You know what? 
I don't have time for this. 
I can have Chloe do it. 
It's fine. 
Wait, that's it? That's 
all you're going to say? 
Let go of me. 
Psst. 
I know it's none of my business, but do we have a bit of a problem? 
No. 
I'll set up your channel. 
Thank you. 
You all right, love? 
Yeah. Thanks. 
Don't mention it. 
(labored breathing) Pull into that garage up there. 
We'll wait there. 
JACK: Stop right up here. 
Fayed, I understand your caution. 
But we can't just sit here while the Americans are looking for us. 
I told you-- we're not going any further until the general calls. 
Tell me, Jamal. 
FAYED: If you take your orders from General Habib as I do, how is it I've never heard of you or your cell? 
This is going south, Jack. 
Just be patient. 
Don't be a fool, Fayed. 
You know how this works. 
Every cell is autonomous, without the knowledge of what the others are doing. 
It is the only way that we can protect ourselves and our operations should any of us get captured. 
(phone rings) Yes? 
(speaking Arabic) The general. 
Alloo? 
HABIB: Fayed... 
(speaking Arabic) NADIA (over radio): "Fayed, I can't speak long. 
I suspect I'm being watched." 
(Fayed speaking Arabic) "So I was told." 
General... 
"General..." 
"these men who rescued me, did you send them?" 
(speaking harshly in Arabic) "Of course I sent them." 
"Do you still have the bombs?" 
(speaking Arabic) "There are two left. 
They're with Halil at a safe house." 
(Habib speaking Arabic) "Why haven't you used them?" 
(Fayed speaking Arabic) "The Russian Gredenko failed to provide us with the means to a secondary target." 
(speaking Arabic) "You failed, Fayed." 
(speaking Arabic) "I should have sent Sameer in your place." 
(speaking Arabic) "Are the bombs operational?" 
"They are." 
"Good." 
"Connect with your men, "get the bombs ready to move out, "call me back at this number. 
"By then, I will have chosen a new target for you. 
Do you understand?" 
Na'am, General. 
"Yes, General." 
Are we good? 
The safe house isn't far. 
Head east toward the 110 Freeway. 
Target vehicle is moving. 
Copy that, Jack. 
Looks like it worked. 
I'll let the White House know. 
Let's go. 
Mr. President? 
Are you feeling all right? 
I'm fine, Karen. 
Just a... 
just a little tired. 
Mr. President, 
I just got word from CTU. 
The general's phone call appears to have satisfied Fayed. 
He's leading them to the safe house and the bombs. 
Oh, thank God. 
I'm pleased we were able to help, Mr. President. 
(Wayne clears throat) (strained): So am I. 
Karen, would you please show the ambassador to his car. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
AMBASSADOR: Forgive me, Mr. President, 
but I believe you asked me to remain here until the crisis is resolved. 
That won't be necessary any longer. 
Thank you again for your cooperation. 
Of course, Mr. President. 
You handled him well, sir. 
(strained): The door, Tom. 
Excuse me, sir? 
What...? 
The door, lock it. 
Mr. President... 
No one can know. 
Sir! 
All shadow teams for Bauer and Doyle have checked in and are standing by. 
They're ready to advance the moment Fayed arrives at the safe house. 
No one moves until Jack calls with confirmation that the nukes are there. 
Make sure Fayed's vehicle and the follow car have a wide berth. 
No choppers in the area. 
Nothing to tip Fayed off. 
Right. 
Sir... 
I think we have a problem. 
What is it? 
I analyzed the transcript between General Habib and Fayed. 
There's an inconsistency. 
During the conversation, the general mentioned a man named Sameer. 
That's right. 
According to the inter-agency database, a Sameer Al-Afted served on the general's staff throughout the '90s. 
He was later implicated in money laundering for various radical organizations. 
Well, that's probably the guy. 
Yeah, well, the problem is, Sameer Al-Afted was killed two years ago in a raid by Afghan forces. 
But the general spoke about him as if he were alive. 
Okay, he could be referring to another Sameer. 
Or it could be a code. 
I think the general was trying to tell Fayed that he was speaking under duress. 
I'd better warn Jack and Doyle. 
Nadia... 
Good work. 
Jack... 
they're turning north onto Adams. 
Jack, we just detected what might be a duress code in the conversation between General Habib and Fayed. 
Give us the specifics. 
The general mentioned sending in a man named Sameer Al-Afted. 
But Sameer's been dead for two years. 
Give me your phone, we need to call Jamal. 
Jack, if they're wrong, you could blow this. 
If they're right, this is already over. 
Now give me your phone! 
(phone rings) Yes? 
JACK: Jamal, this is Agent Bauer. 
I'm in the follow vehicle behind you. 
I need you to listen to me very carefully. 
Go ahead. 
We believe that General Habib may have given Fayed a duress signal. 
Fayed might know that this is a setup. 
Jamal? Jamal, do you copy? 
(static crackling) Damn it, what the hell just happened? 
CTU, we just lost video and audio. 
They went into a tunnel about a quarter of a mile ahead. 
It may just be interference. 
How long is it? 
Checking. 
It's only 120 yards long. 
They should've come out the other side by now. 
Copy that. 
Aerial One, this is Jack Bauer. 
We have lost the target vehicle. 
It entered a tunnel on Adams. 
We need you to seal off the north end. We're going in. 
PILOT: Roger. On our way. 
We got a visual on the target vehicle. 
It stopped in the middle of the tunnel. 
We're going to engage. 
(tires screeching) Now. 
Dead. 
They're both dead. 
Jamal's still alive. 
Stay with him. 
Call in a medic. 
Aerial One, did you see anything leave the north end of the tunnel? 
Aerial One, do you copy? 
(door slams) * * (grunting) (panting) It's me. I'm on my way 
to you now. 
I'll explain when I get there. 
(gears grinding) (engine roaring) Bill, it's Jack! Do you copy?! 
Jack, go ahead. 
Fayed is in a sanitation truck headed east! 
Jack, say again. 
We didn't get that. 
Damn it! 
(transmission static) Jack? 
(static continues) Jack? 
The signal's gone. 
There's no contact from Agent Doyle. 
Aerial One says they're still inside the tunnel. 
Send the call to audio forensics, see if they can pull what Jack said. 
Chloe, replay the satellite feed. 
Back-time it 60 seconds. 
Yes, sir. 
Bill, this is Doyle. 
I don't have a twenty on Jack. 
But I have a dead body at the loading dock. 
Doctor, what is happening to him? 
His blood pressure's dropped. 
It's 80/40. 
It could be any number of things: vascular damage from the adrenaline shot, intracranial swelling... 
Mr. President? 
We have to get you down to Medical. 
No. 
No, I'm not going anywhere. 
(groaning) Just give me another shot of adrenaline. 
No, sir. 
Another injection would kill you. 
I should never have given you that last one. I won't make 
that mistake again, I'm sorry. 
Sir, what are you doing? 
I'm going back to work. 
Would you please listen to this man. 
Let him perform some tests. 
When this crisis is over, Tom, and those nukes are secured. 
In my opinion, you won't last that long. 
I might surprise you. 
Mr. President... 
if you don't get down to Medical right now, you can have my resignation. 
I won't accept your resignation, Arthur, so don't bother. 
Now, please... 
will you excuse us? 
(labored breathing) (whispering): For God's sake, talk some sense into him, Tom. 
It is his decision. 
Tom... 
call CTU. 
I want to know what's happening. 
All right, sir. 
All right. 
HALIL: What's going on, Brother Fayed? 
What happened? 
FAYED: Gredenko betrayed us. 
He led CTU right to me. 
What?! 
They may be tracking me. 
It's not safe here. 
Load the bombs onto the truck. 
We're leaving. 
Where are we going? 
To finish this. 
We're going to take out downtown Los Angeles. 
Let's move! 
You wait here. 
You guys, come with me. 
(bones cracking, low groaning) (gate and chains rattle) (Fayed speaking Arabic) (three gunshots) (gunfire, men shouting) (groaning) (both grunting, shouting) (groaning) (grunting) (pained shouting) (pained groaning) Say hello to your brother. 
(choking) (helicopter blades whirring) Jack? Jack? 
(panting) You all right? 
Yeah. I'm fine. 
How'd you find me? 
Well, we tracked the sanitation truck by satellite. 
Bombs are on the table. 
CTU, this is Doyle. 
We're on site. 
The bombs are secure, and Jack's all right. 
Repeat, the bombs are secure. 
Damn, Jack. 
Let's get you to Medical. 
(groaning): I'm fine. 
(cell phone ringing) Doyle. 
(chamber clicks) You got a call. 
It's being routed through CTU switchboard. 
Thanks. 
This is Bauer. 
Hello? Hello? 
WOMAN (over phone): Jack... 
are you there? 
Can you hear me? 
Audrey? 
Help me, Jack. 
Please, help me. You... 
What the hell is going on? 
Audrey, where are you? 
CHENG: Hello, Mr. Bauer. 
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive. 
If you wish her to remain that way, you will call me back in ten minutes at 310-597-3781 on a secure line. 
If you make any attempt to find our location, she dies. 
Cheng... Cheng!
