Bomb! 
(explosion thunders) Vice President Daniels is running this country now. 
He will implement your security plan. 
Agent Lowry, these men are responsible for the attempted assassination of the president. 
WOMAN:  I have the Vice President  calling for Mr. Buchanan. 
DANIELS:  Bill, I see  from the White House flashes that President Palmer granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough. 
Logan claims he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko. 
DANIELS:  How? 
BUCHANAN:  Through the Russian consulate  in Los Angeles. 
LOGAN: The bomb that exploded this morning was a Russian suitcase nuclear device supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko. 
 Where is he? 
I don't know. 
(phone ringing) Yes? 
MARKOV: The United States has connected you with terrorists. 
The reason we brought the Arabs into this was to conceal our involvement. 
Now we are exposed. 
Russia is exposed. 
Jack, you just spent nearly two years in a Chinese prison because you violated the sovereignty of their consulate. 
Now you plan to go back into the Russian consulate and take a chance on that happening again?! 
BAUER:  How do I find Gredenko?! 
M-Mojave Desert. 
Shadow Valley. 
What is he doing? 
Launching drones. 
How soon will the drones be ready? 
In two hours, all the bombs will be in the air. 
Now! 
I've got to set the transcript codes for the debrief. 
Thank you. 
Who are you? 
I'm just Chloe O'Brian. 
I-I need to do something on this computer. 
Do you know what's going on with Jack Bauer? 
As far as I know, he's still being held in the Russian consulate. 
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan right now. 
He'll be here after his meeting. 
Does he know that I'm all alone here in a holding cell? 
This isn't really a cell, and you're hardly alone. 
This is standard procedure for someone who's under house arrest. 
Excuse me? 
Sorry. 
I-I'm feeling ambivalent. 
I'm gonna go. 
All right, I want to introduce everyone to Mike Doyle. 
He's the new head of Field Ops, just in from Fort Bragg. 
I want all tactical and comm agents to report to him directly. 
Jack Bauer's currently being held captive in the Russian consulate. 
I haven't opened up that information to anyone on the outside. 
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate. 
MILO: So, we're permitted to provoke an international incident just to liberate one of our own operatives? 
No. Liberating Jack 
is a secondary goal. 
Our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul. Now, 
according to Jack, Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the remaining three suitcase nukes. 
Excuse me, but is nobody worried that this could be considered an act of war against the Russians? 
BUCHANAN: Ultimately, it's the vice president's decision if we go in or not. 
But, if Jack is right, and Markov is working with Gredenko, the Russians will have to back down. 
Sir, Logan is ready for you. 
Thank you. 
I want a comprehensive siege profile on my desk ASAP. 
Who has the control keys for the main servers? 
Uh, I do. 
Okay, bracket the scenarios into three. 
I want projected outcomes based on different levels of personnel. 
MILO: Doyle, normally, we run general attack assessment first, then if there's any... 
I don't care what you normally do, Pressman. 
And I wasn't speaking to you. 
I was talking with her. 
MILO: Yeah, that's so weird, 'cause I had this thought that you might come here and not be a jerk, like you were in Denver, but you are. 
That's right. 
Just like Denver. 
Let's get to work. 
I take it you know him? 
Yeah. 
I don't like him very much. 
Does he know what he's doing? 
Yeah, he's good. 
What did Buchanan say? 
We're ready to move on the consulate, pending White House approval. 
Is Jack on his own? 
Yeah. 
This is all about getting Markov, not saving Jack. 
Yeah? 
I'm terminating the American. 
Do you confirm? 
Yes. 
And you're sure there won't be any political complications? 
Not if we stick to our story. 
The American kills our head of security, tries to escape. 
The American has shot Vasili. 
He's in the basement. 
Find him! 
AGENT: Consul Markov? 
Yes. 
We haven't found the American, but I locked down the perimeter. 
There is no way to leave the building. 
He can't be allowed to call out. 
Shut down the phone lines, DSL, everything. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Morris, it's Jack. 
I know how to find Gredenko. 
He's in the... 
(dial tone) Morris? 
Jack? Jack? Jack! 
(dial tone) Come on! 
Damn it! 
Sir, Morris just got a call from Jack. 
The line went dead before he could finish, but he says he knows where Gredenko is. 
Did he trace the call? 
He's still inside the consulate. 
All right, monitor everything in case he calls back, and tell Doyle Bauer's got key intel, and is no longer dispensable. 
Got it. 
I'm sorry. 
We're going to have to reschedule our debrief. 
Why? 
We have an immediate situation at the Russian consulate. 
Does this have something to do with Bauer going back in there to question Markov? 
Please, Bill. 
Maybe I can help. 
Jack was able to get Grendenko's location from Markov. 
He tried to call us, but was cut off before he could say more. 
He's either being held prisoner in the consulate, or he's being pursued. 
Then I was right. 
Markov is involved. 
And he will do whatever it takes to keep Jack quiet. 
We have to extricate Jack, and failing that, we have to go in and remove Markov and interrogate him ourselves. 
We don't have time to go through the red tape. 
There's not gonna be any red tape. 
I'm launching an assault team. 
No, that's... that 
is a huge mistake. 
Markov will not let himself be taken alive, and he will kill Jack Bauer. 
We have to try something. 
We're running out of options. 
Have you tried any pressure from the top? 
From-From President Suvarov? 
Vice President Daniels has spoken to Suvarov. 
He's reluctant to act. 
It's a diplomatic standoff. 
He needs to be convinced to get involved. 
I don't know how to do that. 
I do. 
How? 
My ex-wife, Martha. 
She became friends with the Suvarovs, especially the wife. 
Anya can get through to Yuri. 
He listens to her. 
They're a very good team. 
Um, with all due respect, hasn't Mrs. Logan 
been institutionalized? 
That's beside the point. 
She's in a unique position to help us. 
All right. I'll-I'll... 
put a call in to her. 
Bill, let me do it. 
Martha can be very difficult. 
I think it would be best if I talked to her. 
I didn't realize you were on speaking terms. 
We're not, but I think I can get through to her. 
I know I can. 
Please, let me try. 
That's the way I want it. 
How many on each of those teams? 
Five. 
Okay, make it three. 
More teams, more area covered. 
Fine. 
Who's estimating the consulate defense figures? 
That would be me. 
Where are the numbers? 
I'm just sorting them before I put them out. 
Of course you are. 
Where are the numbers? 
Oh, I see. This is 
about whether or not it takes eight seconds or ten seconds. 
There are your numbers sorted three ways. Pick one. 
Hey! 
Do I have your attention? 
'Cause I only want to do this once. 
I have 25 soldiers that are about to put their asses on the line. 
Whether they live or die largely depends on what gets done here. 
That's not to mention the larger threat of three nuclear weapons that may be down the street, for all we know. 
So, if anyone has a problem taking orders from me without giving me lip, tell me now, and I will have you reassigned. 
Doyle. 
You keep your hands off my people. 
Is that clear? 
DOYLE: They need to understand what I expect from them. 
MILO: I know what you expect. 
That's all that matters. 
You have a problem with somebody on my team, you come to me. 
Fair enough. 
Have your "team" merge their results and download it onto my system. 
You all right? 
The shirt's a blend; it doesn't wrinkle. 
You know what I mean. 
Yes. 
I am all right. 
I thought I was a pain in the ass. 
The Vice President likes you, Tom. 
He hopes you have the right answer for him. 
Well, I hope so, too. 
Tom Lennox, man of the hour. 
It's all right. 
You can leave us alone. 
So, have you given any thought to our earlier conversation? 
Yes, I have, sir. 
And? 
And I agree that the priority here is to protect our country. 
And I am prepared to look the other way regarding details of the assassination plot. 
To a point. 
Well, what does that mean? 
It means the truth must ultimately come out. 
Reed and Carson need to be punished for what they did. 
And they will. 
Look, all I'm trying to do is keep America united. 
I can't have our critics screaming, "Look at how bad we are. 
We're worse than the terrorists." 
We need to keep our eye on the ball right now. 
And on that point, sir, we are in complete agreement. 
Good, because I need you to tell the ambassador of Assad's country that you saw Assad plant the bomb that injured the president. 
Sir, looking the other way is one thing, choosing to tell a lie to the ambassador, that becomes a matter of record. 
Now, you listen to me: If we expect to navigate through this crisis, I need you to cooperate. 
Yes, and I would like to cooperate. 
I'm still talking! 
Come on, now, Tom, let's just count our blessings here for a minute. 
President Palmer survived this awful attack. 
And neither you nor I had anything to do with this heinous plot to kill him. 
And the most beautiful fact of all is that we now have the opportunity to implement the correct policy to stop these terrorist lunatics. 
Can you just put aside your distaste  for my methods for one minute... 
and think about the great gift that's been given to us. 
I will think long and hard, sir. 
Good. 
Now, I need you to tell the ambassador that Assad carried in the bomb. 
I'll take it from there. 
(chuckles): Okay? 
Okay. 
Lisa, get the ambassador clearance and bring him down here. 
Let DOJ know that Lennox has been cleared of any wrongdoing and will continue serving as Chief of Staff. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) Sir, I would like to know what you hope to achieve in your talk with the ambassador. 
I want him to know that I hold his country responsible for all of it the nuke and the presidential assassination attempt. 
They need to be motivated to reign in these terrorists. 
And I want them to know that America is mad as hell and ready to retaliate Here's Fayed. 
It's about time he got here. 
We need to start loading the bombs. 
Mr. Vice President. 
Bill, you're on speaker. 
I'm here with Tom Lennox. 
What's going on at the Russian consulate? 
Jack Bauer's still at large and somewhere inside. 
It appears he now also knows Gredenko's location, but isn't able to get it to us. 
All right, then what's the plan? 
Former President Logan believes he can convince his ex-wife to put a call into Anya Suvarov. 
He thinks the Russian First Lady can get through to her husband. 
(chuckles) That's about as likely as the terrorists knocking on my door and surrendering. 
I agree. 
That's why we've also prepared a siege plan. 
A strike force will enter the consulate and extract Markov for interrogation. 
You realize an attack on a Russian consulate is technically an act of war. 
I do, sir. 
Frankly, I'm reluctant to go the tactical route here. 
We got our hands full with these terrorists, we don't need to open up another front with the Russians. 
Of course, it's your decision, sir. 
I understand the politics are sticky, but my responsibility is to stop these nukes. 
Markov will not surrender willingly. 
We have to go in. 
How long will it take you to put together this siege? 
About 20 minutes. 
All right. 
Proceed as if you're going in. 
If Logan can be effective before then, great.. 
but don't wait on him. 
Yes, sir. 
You ready? 
Yes. 
All right, take your team to their first location, and await our word. 
Got it. 
Martha, I'm back. 
Did you get some rest? 
I've been worried about you. 
Worried about me? 
You shouldn't be out driving around with all that fallout in the air. 
Well, I'm keeping a good distance away. 
How are you? 
Well, I've decided to read my book and listen to music. 
I've lived with enough fear over the years. 
I don't need anymore. 
Good for you. 
Got your magazines. 
Thank you. 
And I stopped by Mel's. 
(gasps) Did you get raspberries? 
(gasps) And blackberries and fresh kiwi. 
Oh, oh, thank God for Mel. 
What would I do without that man's produce? 
Oh, these look beautiful. 
Mmm. 
Ooh, here-- have one. 
I'm fine. 
Come on. 
Hmm? 
Can you get that? 
Martha Logan's bungalow. 
May I speak to Martha, please? 
Who is this? 
It's Charles, Aaron. 
Please put her on; it's important. 
Hold on. 
Who is it? 
It's Charles. 
He says it's important. 
Important to whom? 
Mr. Logan, she doesn't want 
to talk to you. 
I heard what she said. 
Look, listen to me, I'm in CTU in Los Angeles. 
I'm here on government business and it has to do with the nuclear attack. 
I don't understand how Martha could possibly be of any help. 
What you understand really doesn't matter. 
I no longer have to tolerate your sarcasm. 
Please, this was not sarcasm. 
Something needs to be done. 
And, and I think that Martha might be able to help. 
I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Logan, 
but Martha simply doesn't want to speak with you. 
She hasn't taken your calls in almost two years. 
I don't know why you think she would now. 
Tell her it's about the Suvarovs. 
What? 
Just do it. 
Please. 
Martha, he wants to ask you... 
I told you. 
I don't want to talk to him. 
It's about the Suvarovs. 
What's wrong? 
Did something happen? 
I don't know. 
(sighs) What is it? 
Is Anya okay? 
Anya's fine, Martha. 
They're both fine. 
Then what the hell do you want? 
It's a very delicate matter. 
There's an international incident brewing and I think that you might be able to help defuse it. 
Let me get this straight: The government is desperate so they come to you to fix the world... 
and, uh, then you come to me. 
I can't be dragged in another drama, with you Charles. 
I won't. 
You know what's going on today, Martha. 
You know that this is important! 
This is absurd. 
You still there? 
Yes, I'm still here. 
Aaron, you know I wouldn't be playing games on a day like today. 
I know. 
You need to convince her to see me. 
I'm going to take a chopper to you and I'll be there in a few minutes. 
Aaron? 
All right. 
This is Shavers. 
BUCHANAN: Stan, let me talk to Logan. 
Sir, it's Mr. Buchanan. 
Yes, Bill? 
We've dispatched personnel to prepare for an assault on the Russian consulate. 
Bill, attacking the consulate is a huge error in judgment. 
This has been decided. 
The only way to avoid full-out confrontation with the Russians is for you can get Martha to make the call before we engage. 
(woman speaks Russian, then giggles) (man speaks Russian, woman laughs) Slowly... 
both of you against the wall. 
Please don't hurt her. 
I have no intention of hurting either of you. 
But if you don't cooperate, I will kill you. 
You understand me? 
Both of you speak English? 
Yes. 
I need to make an outside call. 
You can't. 
They've cut all communications from the building because you killed Stovich. 
I didn't kill Stovich. 
I don't believe you. 
I don't have to convince you. 
We'll do whatever you want. 
In case of an emergency, how do you contact the outside world? 
Please, there's a SATCOM phone upstairs. 
Get it and bring it down here. 
We're in the middle of a lockdown. 
That's your problem. 
Get me that phone. 
Now! 
Okay. 
Get against the desk. 
Don't be scared. 
You'll be fine. 
Hello, Aaron. 
Martha's waiting for you. 
She's inside. 
Thank you. 
Martha? 
I'll get her. 
What's the matter? 
Apparently she's changed her mind. 
I'm sorry, but she doesn't want to see you. 
Aaron... 
you have to convince her that this is not about us. 
This is for the good of the country. 
I told her that. 
Look, if we don't do something in the next few minutes, there's going to be a U.S. 
led assault on the Russian consulate here in Los Angeles. 
On top of everything else, we will effectively be at war with Russia. 
MARTHA: You've lost weight. 
Martha. 
So this is the new, improved Charles Logan. 
Reborn. 
You look beautiful. 
What do you want? 
I need you to call Anya Suvarov. 
What do you want me to say to her? 
She has to convince Yuri to order the Russian Consul General, here in Los Angeles, to surrender himself. 
And why would he do that? 
Because the man his name is Anatoly Markov he's a criminal and he's working outside of Russian authority. 
So what? 
He's also a mass murderer. 
The bomb that went off this morning in Valencia was supplied to the terrorists with Markov's help. 
There are other bombs out there. 
He knows where they are. 
Why doesn't the White House just contact Yuri directly? 
They did. It didn't work. 
Why not? 
Martha, this is very complicated. 
Please don't make me explain everything in details we don't have much time. 
Oh, oh, oh... 
I'm sorry; just do what you say without asking. 
I'm sorry. 
You haven't changed a bit. 
Look at this. Look at this! 
I'm still under arrest. 
After this is over, I go back to prison. 
I'm just trying to help. 
Prison? 
Is that what you call a 10,000-square-foot house with a swimming pool and tennis court? 
Yuri has to be convinced that this man Markov  is a traitor to his country. 
Anya can make our case for us. 
You're the only person who can reach her fast. 
Do you think I should do this? 
Yes, I do. 
I need a drink. 
(tense, wry laugh) Not that knocking me off the wagon would be a small price to pay for saving the world. 
Get Anya on the phone. 
NADIA: How far are you from the Russian consulate? 
We'll be there in a few minutes. 
Has there been any change of plans? 
No. 
As far as I know, the assault on the consulate is still a go. 
I'm about to talk to Buchannan now. 
Call me if anything changes. 
Okay. 
Have a seat, Mr. Ambassador. 
Thank you. 
How is President Palmer? 
Well... 
The President's a tough man. 
He's injured, but we're confident he'll make a full recovery. 
What a tragic and despicable act. 
I agree. 
What makes it even more troubling is that a citizen of your country, Hamri Al-Assad, was responsible for the assassination attempt. 
I understand that Assad lost his life in the blast. 
But I was led to believe that he was working with President Palmer to promote a peace plan. 
Well, I'm afraid that was all a ruse, Mr. Ambassador. 
Assad's real intentions became clear when he detonated the explosive. 
You have proof of this? 
Conclusive. 
Forensic evidence, as well as at least one eyewitness who saw the detonator in Assad's hand immediately before the explosion. 
Isn't that right, Tom? 
Yes, sir, that is correct. 
Even if what you say is true, you must know that Hamri Al-Assad was not working at the behest of our government. 
He was as much a wanted man in our country as he was in yours. 
Oh, not as much. 
But that's gonna change. 
What are you referring to? 
The terrorists presently on U.S. soil are acting 
under the orders of citizens in your country who have the support of your government. 
I know it and you know it. 
That is simply not true. 
I say it is. 
And I'm willing to bet you that I'm right. 
What do you mean? 
I have a carrier group within striking distance of every major city in your country, waiting for me to give the order. 
You would attack us? 
Abu Fayed, a citizen of your country, enters the United States and detonates a nuclear bomb, killing thousands. 
Next, Assad attempts to assassinate the president. 
We cannot be held responsible. 
You know fully well that we have cooperated with you since the inception of this crisis. 
These threats against us are reckless and counterproductive. 
I had an understanding with your president. 
And now you're going to have one with me. 
You help us find those nukes before another goes off... 
or I'm going to unleash the full power of our military on your country. 
All right, keep me posted. 
Doyle is approaching the staging area. 
We can in the consulate in less than 15 minutes. 
It's going to come right down to the wire. 
What do you mean? 
Charles, Logan and I are trying to arrange a phone call between his ex-wife Martha and Anya Suvarov. 
When? 
Mrs. Suvarov's giving a speech 
right now in Omsk. 
We have to wait till she's finished. 
Even if Mrs. Logan can 
get through to Anya, it's going to take her some time to convince her husband to change his mind. 
I agree. 
It's a long shot. 
It shouldn't take much longer. 
LOGAN: I don't understand. 
This is important. 
Why don't they just interrupt her speech? 
It's Russian politics. 
There's nothing we can do. 
Fine. 
It's gonna be a few more minutes. 
PIERCE: What's the matter, hon? 
This is taking forever. 
I know. 
Aaron... you promise 
you'll stand by me, even if I can't go through with this? 
Of course I will. 
Martha, I'm sorry. 
The last thing I wanted to do was upset you. 
Funny, you always manage to get to that last thing. 
Let me ask you something, Charles. 
Does it bother you to see me with another man? 
Martha, please. 
We may as well talk to fill the time. 
We never really had any closure. 
Well? 
Yes. It's very difficult. 
If you want to know the truth. 
But you've had a rebirth. 
You should be happy for my happiness. 
I am happy for you, Martha. 
I'm sure you are. 
You know, Charles, Aaron has taken such good care of me. 
I don't know what I did to deserve such a good man. 
I never knew what that was before. 
A really good man. 
Martha, if it makes you feel better to insult me, please feel free. 
I didn't come here to fight with you. 
It does make me feel better. 
I can say exactly I want, finally, without having to worry about incurring your wrath. 
The great Charles Logan. 
The President of the Universe. 
The great leader. 
The murderer. 
Martha, I want you to stop this right now. 
You're going to get all stirred up. 
Oh, well, God, we couldn't have that, could we? 
(knife clatters) Mr. Logan, 
if you'd be more comfortable waiting outside, I'd understand. 
I appreciate that, Aaron, but I think I'll stay right here. 
Actually, I'm very thankful that you've been able to be here for Martha. 
You are a good man. 
She's very lucky to have you. 
Now you're trying to irritate me, aren't you? 
No, Martha, no. 
I'm not. 
Oh, cut the crap. 
With the sincerity, the new enlightened soul. 
At least you used to be an honest crook. 
PIERCE: That's enough. 
Please. 
Sorry. 
I'll be a good little girl. 
(Martha yells) Oh, my God. 
We need a medic in here right now! 
He just wouldn't stop and I, oh, oh... 
Oh, my God, what did I do? 
You must've hit an artery. 
Agent Foley, get in here now! 
Somebody, come on! 
Martha, look what you've done! 
MEDIC: He's going in to shock. 
Let's get him out of here. 
Now. 
PIERCE: It happened too fast, Bill. 
I couldn't stop her. 
BUCHANAN: There's nothing we can do about it, Aaron. 
Right now, I've been ordered by the vice president to send an assault team into the Russian consulate, unless President Suvarov intercedes. 
I understand. 
Is Martha capable of having a coherent conversation with Anya Suvarov? 
Honestly, I don't know. 
Chloe's putting the call through any second. Find out. 
Will do. 
Why are they doing this to me? 
I should be given a medal. 
He was one of the biggest criminals in history. 
They gave him house arrest. 
Martha, we're still in a crisis situation. 
Are you able to handle a conversation with Anya Suvarov? 
Of course, I am. 
I'm not crazy. 
I know what the stakes are. 
Are you sure? 
AGENT: Mr. Pierce, 
CTU's got Anya Suvarov on the line for Mrs. Logan. 
They're putting it through now. 
Do you know what you're going to say? 
Anya, it's Martha. 
How are you? 
I'm fine. 
I've been worried about you there in California. 
Stop worrying; everything's gonna be fine. 
I know we have a lot to catch up on, but I'm going to have to be rude and get right to the point. 
There's not a lot of time. 
What is it? 
If you've talked to Yuri recently, you know there's a very tense situation going on at the Russian consulate in Los Angeles. 
I've heard something about that, but don't know the details. 
The details are very important, Anya. 
Please, tell me more. 
The Americans stepped on Russian soil and took me hostage. 
We will sort out the details later. 
Right now, I am ordering you to surrender to the Americans and deliver Jack Bauer, unharmed. 
I am afraid... 
I cannot do that, Mr. President. 
How dare you disobey a direct order. 
You will do exactly as I tell you! 
(phone beeps off) Mr. Buchanan, 
Consul Markov is not cooperating. 
You understand, Mr. President, 
this leaves me with very few options. 
I do. 
I will personally authorize the use of force against the consulate. 
The United States of America has the support of the Russian state in this matter. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(phone beeps off) I got it. 
Get over here. 
Is anybody gonna notice this missing? 
In a few minutes, yes. 
Make your call. 
Did he hurt you? 
No. 
(phone beeps) It needs the unlock code. 
Get down. 
(chamber clicks) BUCHANAN (on phone): Doyle, Suvarov just gave us the go-ahead. 
DOYLE (quietly): Go! 
(chamber clicks) (gun clatters) Are you hit? 
No. 
(phone ringing) Yes? 
It's Markov. 
The Americans are coming in. 
I thought you had that under control. 
No. Won't be long 
(distant gunfire) before they have your position. 
Hold them off as long as you can. 
I will. 
But you must launch now. 
Drop your weapon! 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
This man needs medical attention. They're not hostiles.
