We don't want your money, mr. Latham. 
We just need you to fix something for us.

24 Season07 Episode01 Let the record show this is the third day of this senate hearing investigating human rights violations by the recently disbanded counter terrorist unit. 
Yesterday, when we adjourned, we were discussing brutality and torture by ctu agents in the course of their operations. 
Will the witness please state his name? 
Jack bauer. 
Mr. Bauer, I don't see 
your counsel present. 
Is he or she not aware that we're about to start? 
I have chosen not to retain counsel. 
Mr. Bauer, I have to advise you 
that many of the questions that we' about to pose to you are of a legal nature and might result in answers that could incriminate you. 
I understand that, senator. 
We can postpone your testimony until this afternoon if you'd like to bring in representation something that I would strongly advise. 
What is the first question, senator? 
All right, then. Let's begin. 
Mr. Bauer, who is ibrahim hadad? 
That information is classified. 
We represent the people of the united states, and we have declassified those files on their behalf. 
Now, I'm going to ask you one more time: Who is ibrahim hadad? 
He was a member of a terrorist sleeper cell ctu had under surveillance in 2002. 
And isn't it true that you detained mr. Hadad without due process, 
and that you used extreme interrogation methods on him until he answered your questions? 
Yes, sir. 
Would you say that you broke procedure with this interrogation? 
 Probably. 
 Probably? 
Well, that's A... very cavalier answer. 
You don't seem to care about the implications here. 
Well, mr. Bauer? 
I'm sorry, senator. I 
didn't hear a question. 
All right, then. 
Did you torture mr. Hadad? 
According to the definitions set forth by the geneva convention, yes, I did. 
Senator, why don't I save you some time. 
It's obvious that your agenda is to discredit ctu and generate a series of indictments. 
My only agenda is to get to the truth. 
I don't think it is, sir. 
Excuse me? 
Ibrahim hadad had targeted a bus carrying 45 people, ten of which were children. 
The truth, senator, is I stopped that attack from happening. 
By torturing mr. Hadad. 
By doing what I deemed necessary to protect innocent lives. 
So, basically, what you're saying, mr. Bauer, 
is that the ends justify the means, and that you are above the law. 
When I am activated, when I am brought into a situation, there is a reason. 
And that reason is to complete the objectives of my mission at all costs. 
Even if it means breaking the law? 
For a combat soldier, the difference between success and failure is your ability to adapt to your enemy. 
The people that I deal with they don't care about your rules. 
All they care about is a result. 
My job is to stop them from accomplishing their objectives. 
I simply adapted. 
In answer to your question, am I above the law? No, sir. 
I am more than willing to be judged by the people you claim to represent. 
I will let them decide what price I should pay. 
But please do not sit there with that smug look on your face and expect me to regret the decisions that I have made, because, sir, the truth is, I don'T. 
Excuse me, sir. 
sorry for interrupting, senator. 
I'm renee walker with the fbi. 
We have a subpoena for jack bauer. 
I need him remanded into my custody immediately. 
I'm not surprised that anyone has a subpoena for mr. Bauer, 
but right now, you're going to have to wait your turn. 
He's being questioned by the united states senate. 
Sir, we need mr. Bauer immediately. 
Well, apparently, we're going to have to let you go for w, but we're not done with you. 
We'll reconvene with you tomorrow morning at the same time. Is that understood? 
Yes, sir. 
All right. Then you go 
along with these agents. 
Well, let's proceed. 
Bailiff, call the next witness. 
What is this about? 
Mr. Bauer, I'm special agent 
walker. This is agent teller. 
We need you to come with us to our office. 
 It's just down the block. 
 Why? 
You'll be briefed when we get there. 
 Hello? 
 Janis, it's me. Where's larry? 
He's briefing dornan's group. 
Tell him I've got bauer, we're leaving the hearing now. 
Well, that's good, 'cause the situation's heating up. 
What are you talking about? 
That crew we've been tracking? 
They just grabbed a man named michael latham. 
Latham? He worked on 
homeland's firewall project. 
Oh, he didn't just work on it, he designed it. 
He's the chief engineer of the government's infrastructure security system. 
All right, I'll be there soon. 
Did you get bauer cleared through security yet? 
Not yet. 
Well, renee's bringing him in. 
They're only a couple minutes out. 
Then you won't need him cleared for a couple of minutes. 
 Sean, as a friend, I'd like to keep... 
 you're not my friend. 
Sure. 
As someone as close to a friend as you are ever going to get, let me give you some advice. 
Most people don't like sarcasm. 
I myself have no problem with it, 'cause I'm cheerful. 
I'm a cheerful person. 
You're a cheerful person? 
Just get bauer cleared. 
For the past eight weeks, this office has been investigating a series of technology thefts software, custom gate array chips, neural networks. 
Forensics concluded that the break-ins were the work of the same crew, but we didn't know what their end game was until now. 
This is michael latham. 
He's chief engineer on the classified infrastructure portal, homeland's firewall project. 
He was abducted ten minutes ago by the same group behind the technology thefts. 
You think they're using this guy latham to get through the cip firewall? 
That's our concern. 
The hardware they stole could be used to build a device to do just that. 
And latham's one of the few people that could do it. 
We assume he's being forced to work on the device, or that he's already dead. 
Excuse me-- renee's on her way in with jack bauer. 
Thank you. 
We've tasked your people to help this investigation. See sean. He's got the packets. 
We're on it. 
we're on line with gsa 117. 
How many systems? 
Communications, navigation... 
but we need the other systems working. Check on latham. 
all right... it's done. 
northeast three, this is global skies 117. 
We are ready for clearance. 
Gsa 117, roger. 
You're clear to jfk airport as filed. 
Maintain 5,000. 
Expect flight level of 280 ten minutes after departure. 
Cleared to jfk. Expect flight level 280. 
Welcome to global skies flight number 117, passenger service from reagan-national to jfk. 
Weather in new york is cloudy with a chance of thunder showers, so we may run into some turbulence along the way. 
Tower to skies, awaiting traffic off of dulles. 
Position hold, gsa 117. 
Gsa 117, that's correct. 
mr. Bauer? 
I'm agent larry moss. I'm 
the head of this office. 
You're here because agent walker thinks you might be able to help us with an investigation. 
Now, personally, I have my doubts, but I'll be happy to be proven wrong. 
Well, cky for me, I'm not here to apply for a job, agent moss. 
Personally, I don't care what makes you happy, so let's just get this over with. 
Take him to renee's office. 
Do you want me in the room with you? 
 No. 
 Renee... 
you've read his file. 
Bauer's the kind of guy you say the wrong thing, he can go off. 
I'll be fine, larry. 
If he goes off, I'll call you. 
All right, but if he doesn't produce, don't waste our time. Throw him back. 
What do you want? 
Mr. Bauer, we have a national 
security matter that has gone critical. 
I'm hoping you can help us with it. 
Please sit down. 
I sent the differentials to homeland. 
Was there anything else you needed me to do? 
No. 
Has bauer been indicted yet? 
No, but he will be after the senate hearings. 
The cip firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country if it were breached, telecommunication, transportation, power grids they would all be vulnerable. 
 Agent walker, right? 
 Yes. 
I'm not active. 
The doj is about to file criminal charges against me; I'm not exactly in a position to help you with your situation. 
As much as I understand how dire it is... 
no, I don't think you do. 
One of the men behind this threat... 
is someone you know. 
That's not possible. 
Tony almeida is dead. 
 Apparently not. 
 I was there when he died. 
And he was rushed away by the emts a minute later. 
You never saw him after that, and hours later you were abducted by the chinese government. 
No. No. 
If tony were still alive, I would know. He would have contacted me. 
We recovered this image from a security camera where one of the technology thefts took place. 
It's time-stamped and dated. 
Images can be manipulated. 
Not this one. 
I'm sorry, I don't believe it. 
I had almeida's grave exhumed. 
Dna tests confirmed that it was not his body that was buried. 
The evidence is right here. 
If you want to leave without looking at it, go ahead. 
Gsa 117 on a roll. 
Masters? 
Yes,sir. 
Are we in their system? 
Yes. 
Roger tower,gsa 117,switching to departure 126.8 
Have a good day. 
What's the problem? 
The cip module it stopped working. 
What do you mean it stopped? 
It keeps going out of phase. 
I thought latham said it was good to go. 
Well,it's not. 
All right,let me have it. 
So what did you do? 
I didn't do anything. 
I swear. 
Then why isn't it working? 
I don't know. 
Fix it. 
Now. 
you're gonna want to move faster than that. 
See,'cause if you can't make this work in the next few minutes,I won't need you anymore. 
You understand what that means? 
Good. 
Now fix it. 
Officials say that an estimated 300,000 civilians men,women,and children have been killed as part of general benjamin juma's campaign of ethnic cleansing. 
Survivors in the african nation of sangala, believe american intervention is necessary to prevent further bloodshed. 
The white house has made no public statements... 
juma's perpetrating the worst mass murder africa has seen since rwanda. 
But if you read the columns... 
I do. 
Half of them are against our taking action. 
But if we don'T... 
six months from now,those same members of the press will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy. 
We can always revisit the un option. 
The un's paralyzed,ethan,while people are being butchered by that madman. 
We have to lead. 
Even if it means going it alone. 
I'm not gonna have hundreds of thousands of lives on my conscience. 
General juma has to be stopped. 
He will be,madame president. 
As soon as you give the order. 
Are the joint chiefs here yet? 
They're gathering in the situation room. 
They'll call as soon as they're ready for you. 
I just heard kevin aldrich is doing a piece for cnb. 
He's still pressing his case against sending our troops in. 
As if getting through this day won't be hard enough. 
If you want,I can sit down with him and try to get him to hold off; he's in the press room. 
I'm not sure that's a good idea,henry. 
This is the last thing you need right now,especially with public opinion so split. 
if you think you can talk aldrich down,do it. 
Madame president,the joint chiefs are ready. 
Here's your briefing package. 
Wish me luck. 
Good luck. 
Is this everything? 
It's all there. 
I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but I'm not sure your husband is up to handling aldrich. 
Henry's fine. 
He's better,I realize that,but... 
it's going to take more than a few months. 
He lost a son. 
So did you. 
And you haven't let your loss interfere with your job. 
Your husband is a strong man,but he doesn't have your resilience. 
It's not a matter of resilience,ethan. 
There's not a day that goes by,not a moment when i don't think about my son. 
But I'm about to take this nation to war and grief is a luxury I can't afford right now. 
Before we begin,let me thank each of you for the time and work you've put into this operation. 
Putting american lives at risk is the hardest decision I've ever had to make... 
but it is one that has to be made. 
what was that? 
It's working. 
What was wrong? 
It was overheating. I 
came up with a workaround. 
Try it now. 
There. 
Yeah. 
It's transmitting again. 
We can send and receive. 
Double a-123 maintain course. 
What was that? 
I just got it,too. 
Yeah. I did,but we're back up now. 
No,I'm good. 
No,I'm fine. 
What's going on,phil? 
This is gonna sound crazy,but the three of us just got bumped for a second. 
But the log file doesn't show a power surge. 
This came from the system kernel. 
What are you talking about? 
The kernel's protected. 
Let me have a look. 
All we know for sure is that almeida is part of a homegrown terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure. 
He could be working undercover,some kind of sting operation. 
You need to check every federal agency we have. State and city,too. 
Almeida's not working for any of them. 
Then there must be some other explanation. 
Yeah,there is. 
His wife was brutally murdered by a faction operating inside the government,led by the president himself. 
Everybody involved in that is either in prison or has been killed. 
The government gave president logan a slap on the wrist,they cut him a deal. 
Sentencing him to house arrest on a hundred-acre ranch... 
And you think tony's looking for justice by attacking this country? 
Almeida lost everything he had,and he's blaming it on the government he spent his life serving. 
But you'd know better than me how that feels... 
how far a man might go. 
Not that far. 
And not tony almeida. 
There's a logical explanation for this. 
It's just something you're not seeing. 
Help me find almeida and you can ask him yourself. 
You know how he thinks. 
You had the same training. 
You know the same people. 
I'm going to need complete access to all of your source material everything you've got on this. 
yes? 
Renee,come out here. 
Something just came in. 
Be right there. 
Everything we have on almeida's crew is in this directory. 
Start here... 
I'll be right back. 
What's going on? 
Northeast air traffic control just called. 
They reported a possible intrusion into their communication systems. 
It just happened. 
Can th source them? 
They're trying,but so far,nothing. 
Why do we think this has to do with almeida's crew? 
I don't think you get intrusions like this unless someone's driving it, and the only way to drive it is through the cip firewall. 
So they're going after air traffic control. 
That's what it looks like. 
Put me through to the white house. 
You doing a turnaround in new york? 
Nope. Got two days off. 
I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city. 
Oh,that'll be fun. 
well,doug said we were going to hit some weather. 
I'm going to need tech support to cross-reference your files. 
You'll be working with one of my analysts,sean hillinger. 
He can get you whatever files you need to help us find almeida. 
Good. 
They raise the threat level yet? 
yeah. We think almeida's gup 
got into air traffic control. 
What? 
That doesn't make sense. 
I don't need you to figure it out,jack. 
Just help me find him. 
Sean,this is jack bauer. 
He's going to be working with the almeida files. 
Give him whatever he needs. 
What about interfacing with faa? 
Janis is working with some of dornan's people on that. 
You just help jack. 
Fine. 
I'll check in. 
Thanks. 
What do you want to see? 
Let's start with the technology thefts. 
How many were there? 
Six. 
Let's run a comp on all of them. 
Fantastic. 
The expeditionary strike force and its carrier air wing are now on scene. 
This gives us full spectrum dominance of the battle space. 
What kind of resistance are you anticipating from juma's military? 
Minimal. 
Our air strikes will take out whatever defenses they've got. 
We can expect an open path to juma's front door. 
Good. 
All we need to launch is a go order from you. 
You'll get a green light as soon as I've gone over secretary stevens' post-invasion report, which I'm still waiting for. 
I'll have it for you in a few minutes,ma'am. 
Unless there's a problem you'd like to discuss. 
Madame president,my objection to this operation isn't a secret to anyone in this room. 
For us to be wading into the middle of another civil conflict halfway around the world... 
we're done debating this,joe. 
The un's been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while benjamin juma has slaughtered over 200,000 of his own people. 
That number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now. 
And if you can't get behind what we're doing,I'll find a secretary of state who can. 
But I am done with your handwringing. 
Excuse me,madame president. 
Tim woods from homeland security is outside. 
He needs to see you on another matter. 
Can it wait? 
No,ma'am,it can'T. 
All right. 
We'll continue when I return. 
And,joe,I want that report in front of me when I get back. 
What is it? 
I don't have the details,but it involves a potential domestic breach. 
Tim is here to fill us in. 
Madame president. 
Tim,make this brief; the joint chiefs are waiting. 
We've been working with the fbi the last eight weeks, investigating a series of technology thefts. 
We didn't understand the implications of this until today. 
The same people behind these thefts abducted a man named michael latham. 
He's one of the chief engineers in charge of protecting critical infrastructure. 
Now,tell me what we're dealing with. 
The fbi thinks these same people have forced latham to create a device to hack through the cip firewall. 
The firewall protects all national systems: Energy,utilities,transportation... 
I'm here because the faa reported some irregularities in their air traffic control system. 
Are you saying commercial flights are in danger? 
Possibly. 
Do I need to give the order to ground air traffic? 
I'm afraid it's not that simple. 
Right now,there are more than 3,000 flights over the continental united states. 
To ground them all would take 12 hours,minimum,and it could create a panic. 
Then what do you recommend? 
Let us quietly decrease air traffic while the bureau works their leads. 
We'll make sure you're briefed on a real-time basis. 
I don't like the timing of this... 
timing? 
Could this be connected to our intervention in sangala? 
The fbi hasn't found any connection. 
All the evidence suggests that we're dealing with a domestic terror group, homegrown,with a strong,anti-government bias. 
And these leads you mentioned do you think you'll be able to catch these people before they do any real damage? 
The bureau's got everyone on it,ma'am. 
You didn't answer my question. 
No,ma'am. I didn'T. 
Of course,I don't condone what juma's doing over there. 
But tribal wars are being fought all over the world. 
Why not intervene in thailand,malaysia? 
This isn't a tribal war,kevin. 
It's a genocide. 
Ending it is the moral obligation of a nation as powerful as ours. 
That's a lofty aspiration,but the reality is a lot more complex. 
The president's going into this with both eyes open. 
How can she be sure thcycle of violence won't coinue after juma's been taken out? 
Could be stuck there indefinitely...keeping the peace. 
If I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's post-invasion plans,you might change your mind. 
You're trying to bribe me with an exclusive? 
I'm trying to get you to give us some rope. 
What are you asking me to do,stop writing or write what I don't believe? 
Either one would be fine with me. 
Sir,you have a phone call on your private line. 
Could you excuse me for a moment,please,kevin. 
It's chuck toland,sir. 
Wait. 
Chuck,did you find something? 
I did,but don't get carried away. 
It doesn't confirm your theory about how roger died. 
But it is suspicious. 
I'm listening. 
His girlfriend samantha received a large lump-sum deposit in an off-shore bank account about three days after roger's suicide. 
You mean his alleged suicide. 
Right,sir. 
Where did the money come from? 
I couldn't tell. 
It looks like it's been washed. 
There's no readily identifiable source. 
So...what does this mean? 
All it means is that she suddenly came into $400,000. 
If we're going to find out anything more,I'm going to need to talk to her personally. 
Is that how you want me to handle it? 
no, If she's got anything to hide,she's not going to talk to a private investigator. 
I agree. 
So how do you want me to proceed? 
I'll talk to her myself. 
Is she still at that brokerage firm? 
Yeah,uh,sloane kittridge. 
Good. 
I'm going to finish up here with aldrich. 
Then I need you to take me somewhere,and keep it off the manifest. 
I don't want anyone to know where we're going. 
Yes,sir. 
Agent gedge. 
Yes,sir. 
You think chuck's taking advantage of me,don't you? 
It's not my place to say that,sir. 
I'm asking you anyway. 
Sir,the police and fbi have both investigated your son's death. 
And yes,I believe this pi could be exploiting your grief for personal gain. 
These so-called leads that he's generating have led nowhere. 
My son didn't kill himself. 
I'm sure of it. 
Yes,sir. 
Can you check that socket again,please? 
Has faa reported any more anomalies? 
Not since the first three. 
Maybe it was just a glitch? 
Or it could have been a ripple caused when they broke through the firewall and entered the system. 
Well,if they're in the system,I can't see them,and I've checked every elr socket. 
Keep looking. 
Renee... 
uh,what's going to happen? 
What do you mean? 
If almeida has broken through the firewall then we're screwed,right? 
I mean,crashing couple planes is really nothing compared to contaminating the water system or bringing down the power grid... 
don't think about it,janis. 
Just stay tasK. 
okay,so... 
I will just stay calm,right? 
Yeah. 
Pull up the second one. 
You already looked at it. 
I want to look at it again,pull it up. 
Have you found anything? 
No,we keep looking at the same six forensic reports over and over. 
What are you looking for,jack? 
An entry point. 
They had access cards. 
Yeah,but no one reported their access cards stolen,which means they were forged. 
So... 
These access cards have individual signatures,making them almost impossible to forge. 
There's only a couple guys who can do it. 
Can you access old ctu files? 
Sure. 
Pull up august 1999. 
Code name: Hatteras. 
Just got a call from homeland. 
They briefed the president but she's not ready to ground planes yet. 
Here you go.Hatteras file. 
You know,you can hire a $14.00-an-hour data applications geek to do this; 
you don't need me. 
I wouldn't advertise that. 
There he is-- gabriel schector. 
Who is he? 
He was a supplier. 
Tony and I used him to buy things off-book. 
See if he's in your database. 
Yeah.He's there. 
Is he still in los angeles? 
No.According to this earmark,he came to dc nine weeks ago. 
The thefts started a week after that. 
That's your guy. 
Do you have an address? 
He's subletting an office downtown-- 1208 naylor road,suite 630. 
All right,put a field team together,pick him up. 
I'll call judge simons,have a warrant ready. 
That's a mistake. 
Why? 
You don't have time to go through the motions with schector you serve him with a warrant,he'll call his lawyers,he'll stall as long as he needs. 
So,what's the alternative,jack? 
Break in and torture the guy,like you used to do? 
Isn't that how you ended up in front of a senate sub-committee? 
Oh,is this how it starts? 
You get in my face,tighten your jaw,then if I say something you don't like, you slam me against the wall. 
You have no idea what I do. 
And last time I checked,you subpoenaed me. 
You want my help,you want my advice,take it. 
You don't,don'T. 
I don't care. 
Mr. Bauer... 
you said you used to work with this man schector. 
How well does he know you? 
He knows me. 
Larry,can I talk to you for a second? 
I want to take ber with me. 
No. 
Forget it.I'm not letting him put his hands on a suspect. 
He won't need to put his hands on anybody. 
My guess is if he's in the room,schector will talk. 
Renee,you saw what he just... 
I'm trying to find almeida before it's too late, and schector is our best lead. 
So you want to intimidate him wi bauer? 
Schector knows how far bauer might go. 
Let's use that. 
Yeah,and if schector doesn't blink,then what? 
I'll keep bauer on a short leash. 
Renee,we're the fbi,not ctu. 
We honor the law. 
Even when it's not convenient. 
Look,this situation is heating up fast,larry. 
The president's into it now,and she's expecting results. 
Yeah,I know. 
It's your call. 
But I promise you,can handle bauer. 
All right. 
But I'm holding you responsible. 
And I'm sending backup teams. 
Jack. 
You're coming with me,and you're doing this my way. 
Tell me about schector. 
Out of san diego,till he went on his own. 
Legitimate? 
Yeah,at first,then he got greedy. 
Started using his connections to acquire technology,sell it on the gray market. 
Who'd he sell to,terrorists? 
No.Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties. 
And how did you and tony get involved with him? 
We arrested him,we turned him. 
He was a great conduit for intel. 
Ctu didn't mind that you were letting this guy stay in business? 
Ctu didn't know. 
It was just tony and me. 
So you and tony were tight? 
Yeah... 
yeah,we were close. 
All right,so it sounds like tony,who everyone thinks is dead, puts together a plan to hijack american security. 
He contacts schector to help him with this plan. 
Yeah. 
Except you don't believe it. 
That tony's dirty. 
I believe that tony's alive. 
And I believe he's doing something dangerous,and that we need to find him. 
We confirmed schector's inside. 
How do you want to handle this? 
I'm going in with bauer. 
Alone? 
I want schector to talk. 
I don't want to spook him. 
Call me when backup gets here. 
Matobo's fighters are hidden outside the capitol in three camps. 
Alpha,beta and delta. 
Our ground forces will join up with them once the air strikes are completed. 
Make sure general wagner understands our priority is to maintain order in the streets. 
The people need to see that their country's being governed under the rule of law. 
What happens when matobo's men execute general juma without a trial? 
Should we intervene or let the mob tear them apart? 
I'm meeting with mr. Matobo in a few minutes. 
I'll make sure he keeps his men in line. 
And,joe,I was wrong to dress you down in front of the joint chiefs. 
I'm sorry. 
No need to apologize,madame president. 
You're under a lot of pressure. 
That's still no excuse. 
Thank yo ma'am,I appreciate that. 
The fact remains,if you can't get behind this operation with both shoulders, I will need your resignation. 
That won't be necessary,ma'am. 
Whatever doubts I have,I'll keep them to myself. 
Good. 
Excuse me,madame president. 
What is it,ethan? 
I thought you'd want to know,henry aldrich has agreed to delay his broadcast for 24 hours. 
Henry's doing? 
I,uh,underestimated him. 
Letting him intervene was the right call. 
Well,that's some good news. 
What about the firewall situation? 
Has the fbi made any progress? 
They've identified a man who may have information. 
They're about to question him. 
It's more than likely schector's not going to give you this information easily. 
Just remember,this is an fbi operation. 
We work within the confines of the law. 
You can threaten him,but do not lay hands on him. 
The minute I see you crossing that line,I will pull you back,understood? 
Understood. 
Agent walker,fbi. 
I'm here to talk to gabriel schector. 
Just a second. 
Can I help you? 
Jack bauer? 
How are you,gabe? 
Didn't know you were fbi. 
I'm not. 
Just came along for the ride. 
Mr. Bauer is here under my authority. 
Oh,so I can hold you responsible for anything he does while he's here. 
I have a witness. 
Sure. 
Okay. 
Come on in. 
Please. 
Have a seat. 
this should be an interesting conversation. 
How long's it been,jack? 
Years. 
How's the,uh... 
senate thing doing? 
I hear they dismantled the ctu. 
Don't tell me. 
It was your fault,wasn't it? 
Mr. Schector,we're not here to make small talk. 
I have questions. 
Well,you have my undivided attention. 
Where's tony almeida? 
Tony almeida? 
In the ground,I spose. 
Unless he was cremated. 
Didn't he die at ctu a while back? 
You got an out here,gabe. 
They're not after you. 
They're willing to accept that you didn't know what tony almeidaas going to do with the components that y helped him steal. 
Nobody I knew stole anything,and if they did,I knew nothing about it. 
This is far more serious than you know,mr. Schector. 
If you help us find almeida,I can see to it that you're kept in the clear. 
Otherwise,you could be a co-conspirator to multiple terrorist acts. 
No,well,I think this conversation is over. 
I tried to answer all your questions honestly, but I think,from now on,you can speak to my lawyers. 
So,good-bye,jack. 
And good luck with the senate. 
Hope they fry your ass. 
Ari,could you show these people to the door,please. 
Are you sure you want to play it like this? 
Yeah,that's the way I want to play,jack. 
Drop your weapon. 
Drop it now! 
Okay,okay,okay. 
You two are going to prison! 
This was unprovoked! 
Unprovoked! 
Your man ari was going for his gun-- I've got a witness. 
Why don't we try having this conversation again. 
Where is tony almeida? 
No. 
I'm not talking to you. 
Where is he? 
Tony almeida's dead. 
What do you want me to do? 
This is your call. 
Do whatever it takes. 
This is against the law. 
You can't do this. 
I'm gonna enjoy this. 
Enjoy what? 
All right,all right! 
I'll tell you what I know! 
There's no need for me to lose my good looks over this. 
okay. 
Last time I saw almeida... 
are you all right? 
Yeah. 
Tell your men they've got a shooter on top of the columbia building,heading south. 
Shots fired.Suspects are down. 
The shooter's on the roof of the columbia building across the street. 
Seal all exits. 
Get away from this,jack. 
Tony? 
There's nothing you or the fbi can do about this. 
Just stay away. 
Tony,just talk to me. 
What the hell's going... 
tony... 
tony! 
What's going on at schector's office? 
I don't know.They haven't checked in yet. 
Gsa 117,northeast three,descend pilot's discretion,direct jfk. 
Northeast three,roger,we're starting our descent now. 
Gsa 117,descend and maintain 2,000,expect holding runway four-right. 
Gsa 117,I did not receive your read-back. 
Acknowledge.Over. 
Gsa 117,acknowledge. 
Mr. Paulson,I've lost comm with gsa 117. 
Try the emergency channels. 
I did. 
Nothing. 
And there's no fault on my board. 
I redirected twice. 
Something's interfering with our comm. 
Call back fbi! 
Tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control! 
Gsa 117,acknowledge. 
Gsa 117,this is northeast three. 
Go ahead,air traffic control. 
Advise passing 7,000,maintain 1,500. 
Traffic ahead reporting moderate turbulence. 
Should be a smoother ride for you down there. 
Roger that,northeast three. 
Understand,northeast three,gsa 117. 
Enter descent for 1,500. 
All right. 
Get ready to make the course change. 
We're really taking this all the way. 
You just need to do exactly what I tell you to do. 
Authorisation? 
Bauer, 4393, CTU. 
 OK, we're on it. 
 Get back to me as soon as you get a match. 
(phone rings)  Bauer. 
 Jack, l talked to her. 
Thank God. What'd she say? 
 She and Janet went to some party. 
 So are you gonna pick 'em up? 
 l don't know where she is. She wouldn't say. 
 What? 
Well, l don't know, maybe l'm being paranoid, but she sounded... different. 
l don't know. She told me that she loved me 
before she hung up. That's not Kim. 
She knows she'll get grounded. 
She's trying to reduce the sentence. 
Yeah, you're probably right. 
How are you? Are you OK? 
Yeah, yeah, l'm fine. Look, 
is that guy York still with you? 
 Yeah, he's gonna take me home now. 
 Shouldn't you wait by Janet's car? 
Who knows what shape the girls are gonna be in when they get back? 
Well, no. Alan doesn't seem 
to think that's necessary. 
 Why don't you put Alan on the phone? 
 Jack, don't do this. 
 Teri, just put him on the phone. 
 OK. 
Alan, my husband would like to speak with you. 
(loud rap music)  Hi, this is Alan. 
 Alan, Jack Bauer. 
Can't thankyou enough for helping out with this. 
 l'm just glad the girls are with each other. 
 Me too. Look, l'm stuck at work. 
Yeah. Teri said... 
l would appreciate it if you would hang out at the store and wait for them to return. 
Uh, l don't think they're gonna be back here for at least a couple of hours. 
lt's a pretty rough neighbourhood and l'd hate for there to be a problem when they return. 
 Sure. We'll stay. 
 Thank you. 
Thank you. 
(Gaines) You gotta be kidding me. 
We had a deal, Mandy. 
You promised to get Belkin's lD in exchange for $1 million. Now she wants to double it? 
 She doesn't know how this works. 
 No, this is your fault. 
 You should never have involved an amateur. 
 lf l'm such an amateur, how... 
 l'm just trying to get us more money. 
 There is no money. Not any more. 
lra, don't turn this into something else. l will fix it. 
(phone rings) What? 
No, we don't have it yet. 
Yes. No, of course. 
l will get back to you as soon as we're ready. 
Talk to her. Explain what l do. 
 l will, but our deal stands. 
 Take care of it! 
l need to get out of here, my friend. 
lt'll just be a little longer. 
We've been getting death threats ever since my husband announced his candidacy. 
 What is different about this one? 
 l'm not privy to that kind of information. 
All l can tell you is that my unit is only called in when the threat becomes more serious. 
Then why did you let him walk out on his own? 
We will find him, Mrs Palmer. 
l, uh, l'm sorry. 
We're grateful to have you here. 
 He's not in the lobby. l looked everywhere. 
 You shouldn't leave the suites. 
 Let these men do their jobs. 
 There's a coffee shop a few blocks down. 
 l bet he wanted to be by himself. l'll get him. 
 No, Keith. You're not going anywhere. 
Secret Service knows this city a lot better than we do. 
 l'll be right back. 
 l'm sorry, son. 
 We need you to stay here. 
 Why? 
We treat a threat on a candidate's life as a threat to the entire family. 
We need to protect you as well. 
Keith... 
Your father's going to be fine. 
 (Dan) Yeah? 
 Gaines. l need an update on the Bauer girl. 
Everything's copa. We're just waiting for you. 
 l'm running a little late. 
 We're not going anywhere. 
That's right, you're not. 
She's in a lot of pain, man. 
l think you broke her arm. 
Think so? Should we take her 
to the hospital and get some x-rays? 
Gaines is running late. l'm gonna 
smoke another j. You want one? 
Sure. 
(Janet cries in pain) My arm... My arm... 
Dan, please. She needs to see a doctor. 
 At least give her something, man. 
 l'm not wasting my stash on her. 
So, what, is Dan the boss and you do everything he says? 
Thought l told you... 
Don't press me, man. 
l should never have used you. 
You're gonna give her that? 
Want me to take away the pain or not? 
(whooping) Hey. 
Hey, man, this is a private lot, homey. 
You gotta pay to park here. 
l see. And you're the attendant? 
That's right. And it's gonna cost you 
a hundred dollars. So deal it up. 
You that dude! Uh, Palmer. 
 No. That's not me. 
 Yeah, it's you. lt's him! 
Yo, this guy's running for president, dog. 
l seen him on TV. 
Yeah? Yeah, yeah. 
Yeah. So what you gonna 
do for me, Mr President? 
See, that's your problem. 
You want everyone else to do the work. 
What are you gonna do for yourselves? 
See, man? All y'all, y'all got the same rap. 
Keep going like this... 
and you'll be dead in five years. 
 Man, like you know my life. 
 More than you think. 
Whoo! 
Yeah! 
Whoo! 
 CTU. Myers. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 About a block away. 
l need you to print up a hard copy of Tony's passenger breakdown and put it on my desk. 
Wait for me. l wanna talk to you, 
but not in front of the others. 
 Sure. 
 Great. l'll be there in a minute. Bye. 
Keep working. Has Division responded 
to the two dead agents yet? 
 Yeah, they're picking them up now. 
 Good. 
 Anyone we know? 
 Someone we know. 
l'm afraid it was Richard Walsh. 
l'm sorry, Jamey, l know what he meant to you. 
What is going on? ls this 
anything to do with Palmer? 
That's what we gotta find out. Look, 
l don't have time to go into all the details, but l've got to put you in a difficult position. 
You're the only person l can trust. 
What do you mean? 
Walsh said we've got a problem on the inside. 
He told me to talk only to you. 
This is the key card l sent you. On it is 
pertinent information to the hit on Palmer. 
How long is it gonna take you to pull all the data off it? 
Depending on the kind of encryption, it could take hours. 
Palmer's day starts at six. 
l need it before then. 
One more thing. l need to be certain that 
it was Nina's computer that burnt that card. 
Why? 
Because if it was, she's dirty. 
l'll need a few minutes alone at her workstation. 
Fine. You got it. 
Did you cut yourself? 
 Yeah. What are you working on? 
 l gave Nina the passenger list. 
l'm cross-checking everything else we've got. 
Good. l'll be down in a sec. 
 So why were you at Dunlop Plaza? 
 l had a meeting with Walsh. 
 ls that the passenger list? 
 Yes. 
Anything unusual? 
There's one red flag. A man in first class. 
His information is inconsistent. 
 l'm trying to piece it together now. 
 Good. 
l don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but not letting me know where you are, holding back information... 
How can l help you without you letting me? 
Do you think that it's possible that someone from within the agency is behind the hit on Palmer? 
Anything's possible. Do you have a lead? 
No. Not really. 
No. 
Why do l feel like you're not telling me the truth? 
lf you've got something, tell me. 
l'll work it up with you. 
No, l'm... 
l'm just thinking out loud. 
OK. Fine. 
ls there anything else? 
No. 
Actually, there is. 
Are you seeing Tony? 
Why? 
ls it serious? 
What is this, Jack? 
What do you want to know? Am l over you? 
Why are we talking about this now? 
l'm trying to understand why he's been giving me such a hard time. 
Yeah, well, l can't answer that for you. 
(phone rings) Hold on. 
 Yeah? 
 l confirmed it. 
The file on the key card definitely came from Nina's computer. 
OK. Thank you. 
lt's Division. 
They want the passenger breakdown. 
Please send it to them. 
Sure. 
By the way, your wife called. 
(phone rings)  Bauer. 
 This is Data Services. 
 You called in a thumbprint an hour ago? 
 Yeah. 
We checked every database we have. Nothing. 
Either this guy doesn't exist or his identity was wiped offthe record. 
Thank you. 
 This is gonna work out better for both of us. 
 l don't care, Bridgit. Where is the lD? 
This is not some secret l'm keeping from you. This is for both of us. 
 Do you wanna get both of us killed? 
 They hired you to blow up a plane. 
Another million dollars means nothing to these people. 
You're wrong. Money is the only thing 
''these people'' care about. 
Let's do it anyway. 
You know he can't hurt us. 
Baby... 
Nobody can hurt us. 
One million for you, one million for me. 
Don't you like the way that sounds? 
OK. 
We're gonna do this your way. 
Great. OK, let's tell him. 
No. lt'll be better if l do it myself. 
You're always looking out for me. 
 What happened? 
 Do you remember anything? 
Yeah. 
We were at the furniture store... 
dancing... Where's Dan? 
Shh. 
Dan broke your arm. 
He didn't break my arm. Dan likes me. 
Yeah, look at it. 
Ow... My arm... 
OK. 
Come on. 
Listen to me. This is serious. 
We're being kidnapped. 
We need to escape. Can you walk? 
 l guess. 
 OK. Come on. 
Get ready. When l say ''go'', we go. 
Go where? 
Just stay with me, OK? 
You gotta understand this, OK? 
We could die if we don't get out of here. Hold my hand. 
Go. 
Hey! 
 Hey! 
 No! Get back here! 
 We gotta get them. 
 Hey! 
 Catch them! 
 l am! 
This is your fault! 
This is what l was talking about! 
Shut up! 
 Get back here! 
 We gotta get them. They can not get away. 
This is good work. 
Keep me informed. Thank you. 
 Certainly. 
 Thanks, Jack. 
Shut the door. 
 Are we saying Nina's a traitor? 
 Not yet. We need to know more. 
Should l shut down her confidential access? 
No, that'll slow everything down. There's 
gotta be some kind of explanation for this. 
Right now what l really need is the data off that card. 
But aren't we obligated to seal off her channels with this much evidence? 
Look, you were seeing her, weren't you? 
 That is none of your business. 
 l think in this case it is. 
Yes. When my wife and l were separated, 
yes, l was seeing Nina. 
 Did you say anything you shouldn't have? 
 No. 
l don't think so. 
l trusted her... with everything 
that was coming through here, but... 
 Fine. Shut down her access. 
 OK. What's she working on? 
 747 passenger list. 
 Good. That's not on a secure socket. 
 l can do it without her knowing. 
 Good. 
 Jamey? 
 Don't worry, l won't say anything. 
Thank you. 
Gotta get them. 
 Hey, get outta here. 
 (Dan) Where'd they go? 
 Ah, forget it. 
 Aw, come on, man. Come on. Don't. 
Hey, come back! Scumbag. 
You just cost me 50 bucks! 
You're gonna pay for this. 
 Word up. 
 Did you see two girls run past here? 
 Yeah, l seen 'em. 
 Which way did they go? 
 Who are they? 
 Did you see 'em or not? 
 They went down Central. 
 (phone rings) Check it out. l'll look around here. 
 Yeah? 
 lt's Gaines. How's it going? 
 Everything's fine. 
 Change ofplan. We meet at a new location. 
Just let me know. l'll meet you there. 
 We need to get to a phone. 
 No, you need to pay up. 
ls this real? 
Thank you very much. 
 What couldn't wait till morning? 
 Maureen Kingsley called. 
Said she had some new information. 
David, you got me out of bed at 2am. What did she say? 
She said the Gibson boy, the one who... raped Nicole, 
didn't commit suicide. 
That he was thrown out of the window. 
So, he was thrown out of a window. Who cares? 
She said it was Keith! 
She's gonna publicly accuse my son of murder. 
 OK, there's a couple of ways to handle this. 
 lt's a lie, Carl. 
lt's dirty politics and l won't stand for it. 
My family lived through that nightmare and l won't put Nicole through it again. 
 And Keith? Keith couldn't... 
 This bastard, Hodges, he waits till the day of the primary so you can't respond. 
 l don't care what day it is. lt's a lie... 
 l know. 
But we can't pretend today isn't important. 
l'll put a lid on Kingsley until the polls close. 
 We win the primary then take it from there. 
 No. We find the source, make them recant. 
Oh, l'll figure out where this is coming from and l'll cut it off, but, David... 
We go back years. You have your principles, 
you don't compromise, blah blah blah. 
That's why l love you. But you knew 
the gloves would come off. Well, they are off. 
That's why you have me. 
Go back and forget about this. 
l'm on it. 
l can't let them throw my son to the wolves. 
David, l'll take care of it. 
(screeching tyres)  ls that you? 
 Yeah. You better get lost. 
Call you in an hour. 
lt's OK, fellas. 
l'm fine. 
Dammit. 
Janet, let's go back to the front and wait for them to leave. 
 (Rick) They're not on Central. 
 (Dan) Keep looking. We gotta find 'em. 
(Rick) OK, l'll take the side streets. 
They're around here somewhere. 
(Dan) Gaines just called me. 
We gotta find them! 
 You're in my space. 
 l'm sorry. We'll leave. 
 ls there a phone around here? 
 No. 
What are you looking for? 
You wanna score some dope? 
We need to get rid of those guys. ls there 
any way you can help us get to a phone? 
You want me to help you? 
What are your little designer jeans worth? 500 bills? 
And those kicks, like another, what, 25? 
You wanna trade places with me for a while? 
Wanna turn some tricks while l go snuggle with your daddy in the Hollywood foothills? 
Go away. 
We've been kidnapped. l don't know... 
Her arm is broken. 
Those guys are still out there. 
Welcome to the neighbourhood. 
Well, is there any other way out besides the front door? 
 But if we just... 
 ''But'' nothing. Get out! 
Go! 
How long have you been playing me? 
 Playing you? 
 Playing me. 
What are you doing? 
 Why don't you tell me about this? 
 Tell you what? 
You loaded this card with intel on the hit on Palmer. 
l wanna know who you work for and who you smuggled this card to. 
You're delirious. 
 Who are you working for? 
 l work for you. 
Who are you working for? 
 Who are you working for?! 
 l work for you! 
Whoever programmed this card is involved with the hit on Palmer. 
This came from your computer. 
l don't care where it came from, l didn't do it. 
And l can't believe that you think l did. 
There it is. One million in your account 
in addition to what we already agreed on. 
Where's the lD? 
Let's get it. 
 No, just the three of us. 
 And why do l trust you? 
Because you want the lD. 
l'm gonna miss you, Mandy. 
 How's your arm? 
 lt's OK if l don't move it. 
Then don't move it. 
l know you're in here. 
l can smell your perfume. 
Where are you? 
This is starting to piss me off! 
(man) He's gonna be ready. 
Hey, l'm telling you, you know, l saw him work out yesterday. He looked good. 
He's gonna be ready. 
 Excuse me. 
 Let me call you back. 
 You looking for something? 
 Please, help us. These guys are after us. 
 What guys? 
 l'll pay whatever you want. 
Just get us out of here. 
 Let's see the money. 
 l don't have it on me right now. 
But when you get us home, my parents will pay whatever you want. 
Sorry, l run a cash-up-front business. 
 What's your name, sweetheart? 
 Janet. 
Look, can we just use your phone at least? Please? 
Come here! 
Go! Take the phone and run! Go! Go! Go! 
Go! 
Run! 
 lt's cool, man. lt's cool. 
 Run! 
ls this right? 
 What? 
 They just posted a memorandum. 
Richard Walsh is dead. 
That can't be. l mean, 
he was just here an hour ago. 
That's what it says. 
Oh, my God. 
Can you find out what happened? 
Jack's got me working on something. 
Can you open up a socket on the terminal? l'll check it myself. 
Sure. 
Thanks. 
 Farrell. 
 l need you up here now. Do you have it yet? 
 Almost. Another couple of minutes. 
 Soon as you're done, come up. 
Thank you. 
(gunshot) That job this summer - you in? 
Yes. 
OK, Jonathan, you're done. 
You had no choice. 
The key card was definitely programmed on Nina's computer. Login time was 10.14pm. 
Looks like the next 20 minutes were spent gathering data, and then another seven to burn it into the key card. Logout was 10.41, January 14. 
lt specifies which files were accessed. 
lf you want details, there are two screens of... 
Wait a sec. What was the date? 
 January 14, a couple of months ago. 
 Second weekend in January, Jack. 
(Jamey) That's all l got. 
Thank you, Jamey, that's all l need right now. 
That was the same weekend that we were in Santa Barbara together. 
So someone from this office has hacked your login code. They're in your system. 
 You were way off on this one, Jack. 
 l'm sorry... 
How could you? 
 Division. 
 lt's Tony Almeida at CTU. 
Look, you'd better get down here right away. 
Jack Bauer needs to be relieved of his command. 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 Mom, you gotta come get us. 
 What's wrong? Are you at the party? 
 There was no party. They made us say that. 
 Who? 
 These guys. We're in North Hollywood. 
 Behind... 
 Platt's Auto Body. 
 Platt's Auto Body. 
 They're coming! 
 Mom, you gotta come now! 
 Kim! Kim! 
What's going on? Teri? 
 911 emergency. 
 My daughter's in trouble. 
She's in North Hollywood behind Platt's Auto Body. Someone was chasing her. 
(Janet) Come on, Kim. 
(tyres screech) (driver shouts in Spanish) No... No... No! 
No, look at me. (sobs) Look at me! 
 Oh, God! Oh, God! 
 (footsteps) No! 
 l told you to chill! Why didn't you listen? 
 Let go of me! No! 
 Shut up! 
 No! 
 What about her? 
 Forget her. Let's go. 
 Come on! 
 No! No! 
Come on. Let's keep moving. 
(Dan) Shut up! 
Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day ofmy life. 
(Jack) Bob, what just happened? 
l can't hear you. 
Bob, can you hear me? 
Bob? 
Bob, can you hear me? 
Bob, pick up the phone. 
Somebody pick up the phone. 
Bob, can you hear me? 
Whoever's there, just pick up the phone. 
Bob? 
Can anyone hear me? 
Just pick up the phone. 
 Pick up the pho... 
 (bleep) (Ellis) At the beep, leave a message for Bob Ellis. 
Oh, God, no. 
Think, Jack. Just think. 
 Routing operator. 
 This is Jack Bauer. 
l want you to transfer me to Agent Watson in our New Orleans office. 
 One moment, please. 
 Thank you. 
CTU New Orleans. Watson speaking. 
lt's Jack Bauer at Los Angeles. You've got 
an NSA operative in your region, Robert Ellis. 
 l think something happened to him. 
 What wouldyou like us to do? 
l'll transfer you to our comm for the address. 
Check it. Call me as soon you get anything. 
 Jack! Jack! 
 l'll transfer you now. Not now, Milo. 
 Jack, you gotta see this. 
 What? 
Look. These are surveillance shots 
of all three backup shooters. 
l cross-referenced the files that Ellis sent us with our lnterpol records. 
 How long ago? 
 Just now. 
Any or all of them could still be targeting Palmer. 
Or you. 
 Right. 
 l just sent the photos off to Secret Service. 
Make sure they brief Palmer's staff. 
l want them to keep their eyes open. 
Right. There's one more thing, though. 
''Johnny-cool guy'' here. 
His name is Alexis Drazen. 
He's Victor Drazen's son. 
He was trained in Belgrade. Special Forces. 
Good work. 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 lt's me. 
l wanted to tellyou we're not leaving town today after all. 
Well, what made the senator decide to change his plans? 
He didn't say and l didn't ask. l was just 
happy l would get to see you again so soon. 
Well, l'm leaving a meeting right now. 
But l can be back at the hotel by 4.30. 
 OK. l know where to find you. 
 OK. 
(radio) 10-98, can you give me a delta check? 
This is Daniels. l'm in position. 
Touch your ear if you hear me. 
(Daniels) Paulson, do you read me? 
Yeah. 
(Paulson) Breeher, talk to me. 
Howyou lookin'? 
 lt's quiet on my end. 
 (phone rings) Paulson. Yeah, Jack, hold on. 
(knock at door) Excuse me, Mrs Bauer. 
 lt's Jack. 
 Thank you. 
 Jack? 
 How you doing? 
l'm doing OK. Just trying to get some rest. 
Look, l couldn't help feeling after l hung up that... 
l don't know, that something was wrong. 
No, l'm fine. 
A lot's happened, and... 
 l really need to talk to you. 
 Fine, then let's talk. 
 No, not now. Now's not the time. 
 Why not? 
You do what you have to do and we'll talk when this is all over, OK? 
OK. 
l'm here at CTU ifyou need me. 
l know. 
OK. Bye. 
(Pierce) Folks, l know you're all busy, so l'll be as brief as l can be. 
 Good. You're just in time. 
 (Palmer) What's going on? 
Bauer sent over photos of the people targeting you. 
The threat against Senator Palmer remains a high probability. 
But we have gotten a significant piece of heads-up intelligence. 
These three men... 
are the suspected shooters. 
Now, since you're all on the front line of this campaign, we're hoping you can expand our surveillance reach. 
We can always use more eyes and ears in the field. 
lf you see anyone who you suspect as being one of these people, let an agent know immediately. 
 (Pierce) Everybody clear on that? 
 Elizabeth, what's wrong? 
 (Nina) OK, but the fact is, Rick ran away. 
 He was scared. 
(Nina) Apparently. 
Any explanation he has doesn't change the fact he's a fugitive. 
lf you know where he is and aren't telling us, that constitutes... 
 l don't know where he is. 
 Are you sure? 
What l am sure of is that he helped us escape and if it wasn't for him, we would have never got out of there. 
Kim... 
When people are taken hostage, it's not uncommon for them to feel a certain bond with their kidnappers. 
Rick isn't a kidnapper. 
And anyway, l don't know where he is. 
Oh, l'm sorry, Nina. 
l thought you were finished. 
Um... whenever you're ready, 
we can pick up where we left off. 
OK. Um... 
Why don't you take a break, and your mother and l can finish up in here. 
You OK? 
 Sure you're OK to do this? 
 Yeah, sure. Are you? 
Yeah. 
Listen, Nina, um... 
l don't want you to have to tiptoe around me. 
Jack and l were separated when you slept with him. 
l'm not gonna hold that against you, OK? 
OK, um... 
You and Kim have both said that Rick helped you. 
But talking to Kim, l get the sense that she's withholding something. 
Based on what? 
She's protecting Rick. 
She seems to have feelings for him, from what l can tell. 
Well, there may have been an attraction when she met him last night, but if Kimberly knew anything l'm sure she'd tell you. 
Are you sure about that? 
She's my daughter. l think 
l know her better than you. 
(phone rings)  Bauer. 
 lt's David Palmer. 
 Sir, is everything all right? 
 l'm not sure. 
What's going on? 
A member of my advance team, Elizabeth Nash, she recognised one of the assassins in the photos you sent Secret Service. 
lt's Victor Drazen's son, Alexis. 
 Does she know where he is? 
 They're in contact. 
''Contact''? What do you mean? 
ln which context? 
lntimate. 
Senator, is this person in a position to endanger your security? 
l'm afraid so. Look, she's pretty shaken up, 
but she wants to help. 
Good. We have to bring her in 
to CTU and question her. 
We'll get a helicopter over to you. 
l'll have her ready. Oh, what about Ellis? Did 
he retrieve the file on Operation Nightfall? 
 l lost contact with Ellis. 
 ''Lost contact''? What do you mean? 
We got interrupted in the middle of our phone call. Sir, l've got a very bad feeling about this. 
 So what are you telling me? 
 For now, we have to assume Ellis is dead. 
 Keep me posted. 
 Yes, sir. 
Milo, get me chopper command. 
(phone ringing) ( ''Who's That Kat?'' by the Salads) 
 Hello? 
 Rick, it's Kim. 
 Hey. 
 This woman here, she's really pushing me. 
 What'd you tell her? 
 The truth. That you helped us escape. 
Well, that's really gonna save my ass. 
l'm sorry. l'm a little edgy right now. 
l just think, if you tell her what happened, it'll work out. 
She won't believe me. 
l don't know how much longer l can cover for you. 
OK, OK. Can she prove anything? 
l don't think so. 
Well, that's all that matters. 
Listen, l appreciate what you're doing and all, but you probably shouldn't call here. 
 At least not for a while. 
 How long? 
l dunno. l gotta... 
 Who's that? 
 l don't know. Just a wrong number. 
l'm worked. l'm gonna crash for a while, OK? 
So is there anything else you can tell me about Gaines? 
Maybe a conversation you overheard? 
 Who's Gaines? 
 lra Gaines, the leader of the group. 
Right. 
 Teri... 
 Nina, l'm fine. 
Maybe we should take a break. 
Maybe you should do your job, Nina. 
Don't you have a job to do? 
l wish it were that simple. 
Things tend to get complicated when you screw your boss. 
Look, this obviously isn't working. 
No, it's not. 
l'm sorry. l thought l could stay calm and 
rational about this, but l can't do it. l'm sorry. 
There's no apology needed, but l think Paulson should finish up here. 
George. What are you doing here? 
 l'm the new quarterback. 
 Since when? 
 Since right now. 
 What about Alberta Green? 
Back at District. 
So Chapelle thought you'd do a better job keeping an eye on me than she would. 
l dunno, Jack. Something like that, l guess. 
So, it's really Drazen's boys that are after Palmer, huh? 
This whole thing is a revenge play for killing their father. 
l know why they're gunning for you, but why are they after Palmer? 
Senator Palmer was head of the subcommittee that authorised the mission. 
 You got Ellis tracking down the file on that? 
 l had Ellis. 
l lost contact with him 20 minutes ago. 
You think they took him out? 
Yes, l do. We got a break 
on another front, though. 
A Ms Elizabeth Nash, part of the senator's advance team, identified one of the shooters from photos l sent over. She'd been dating him. 
She had no idea who he was. She's shaken up 
but she's on her way here for a debriefing. 
Which one of 'em was she seeing? 
Alexis Drazen. She's supposed to 
meet him in his hotel room in an hour. 
Good. That'll give us time to stage an arrest. 
Think about this. What if she keeps her date? 
We'd have the upper hand for the first time. 
 See what we could learn. 
 lt's risky. 
l'd have a squad across the hall ready to go into that room before anything could happen. 
George, l think this is too big an opportunity just to pass up. 
 What time is she getting here? 
 Ten minutes. 
 We'll talk to her, then make up our minds. 
 Absolutely. 
 She's going to the CTU office. 
 (man) Why are they taking her there? 
They wanna find out all they can about this Alexis Drazen. 
 ls that the brother? 
 No, it's his son. 
 Hey, let me call you back. 
 All right. l'll wait foryour call. 
Keith, come in. 
What's up? 
We haven't had much chance to talk since last night, and it seems like every time we do, we're at each other's throats. 
Everything's OK between you and me. 
l guess you've noticed that we haven't been quite on the same page today. 
lt has been kinda hard to miss. 
The pressure's on. lt's testing all of us. 
For sure. 
That's what l wanted to talk about. 
lt stayed in my head, what you said a couple of hours ago. 
About how Dr Ferragamo was always there when you needed someone, and l wasn't. 
l'm sorry. But that's just how it was then. 
That's all gonna change. 
Starting now. 
l know l can't earn your trust overnight. 
But if you just come to me when you need to talk, l promise you, son, l'll always be there. 
Thanks, Dad. 
So what about Dr Ferragamo? 
Did the police say anything? 
We haven't called yet. 
 What are we waiting for? 
 We're not putting anything off, Keith. 
lt's just something else has come up. Listen 
to me. We have a security breach on our staff. 
We have to deal with that first. 
What kind of security breach? 
 l can't tell you. 
 You can't tell me anything. 
Look, Keith, l have to be able to make decisions without you challenging me. 
Look, everything you're feeling... 
Now's the time l need you, Dad. 
Not just to talk to me, but to do the right thing. 
Keith... Keith! 
l will do the right thing... at the right time. 
Yeah, l'm sure you will. 
l've found Bauer's wife and daughter. 
They were moved to a safe house. 
 Where are you? 
 l'm almost in. 
How many men are guarding them? 
l'm handling the situation, Andre. Rest 
assured, the women will be dead soon. 
Call me the minute it's done. 
 Milo, can you help me out with something? 
 Yeah. 
What's wrong with the system? My terminal's 
locked. l just downloaded all my files to here. 
Dammit! 
Whoa, just hold on a second. Let me see. 
Why can't l log in? 
 What, you mean Mason didn't tell you? 
 Tell me what? 
They downgraded your privileges to 3W. 
You're the same as everyone else down here. 
l see. 
Look, here. This should 
get you into anything you need. 
Thanks. 
Jack, don't worry. You'll be back 
in your office by tomorrow. 
 By tomorrow l'll be in federal custody. 
 But why... 
l'm only on provisional status for the day. 
When Palmer leaves the state, l face charges. 
Yeah. 
l'm sorry. Look, you're all set here. Just... 
Thanks. 
 Milo? 
 Yeah? 
Have you noticed anyone accessing anything unusual on the servers? 
What do you mean? 
l don't know. Anything received 
or relating to sensitive intel. 
No, but l haven't been looking for it. 
Start looking. 
Wait, you think there's another mole inside CTU? 
l don't know. Just let me know 
if you find anything, OK? 
OK. 
 All l'm saying is, don't test me. 
 (Carl) l'm not. 
 l will do what l said! 
 (sighs) Keith... 
l'm serious. l have nothing 
left to lose. Not any more. 
 You're upset... 
 That's right. 
 OK, we should talk. 
 l'm glad you understand. 
 You know the Griffith Park Observatory? 
 Yeah. 
Can you meet me there now? 
Yeah, l can be there. 15 minutes. 
 Be where? 
 Nowhere. 
 Keith... 
 l'm trying to protect you. 
The last time you tried to protect me, someone died. 
Nicole, please. 
l'm sorry. That was a terrible thing to say. 
 The less you know... 
 Who were you talking to on the phone? 
 You trust me, don't you? 
 Trust goes both ways, Keith. 
Carl. 
Why? 
l don't wanna spend my life with the same regret l've had for the past seven years. 
 You didn't kill Gibson intentionally. 
 But l kept the truth from coming out. 
And now, with Dr Ferragamo dead... 
Look, l can't do that again, Nicole. 
l won't. And l need your help. 
For what? 
Listen, this Secret Service guy's been dogging me all day. 
 Help me get past him. 
 He's here to protect us. 
Everything that's been happening today, everything that's still happening. 
lt's not too late to change the way this all plays out. 
Now, do you trust me or not? 
OK. Good. OK. 
All right. 
Excuse me. l was on the phone 
and l heard a clicking sound, and l'm wondering if that's my dad being bugged or if l'm just being paranoid. 
(agent) Well, why don't we just go check it out? 
(TV noise) Victor Drazen had two sons. 
We know Alexis Drazen is here. l think we 
should assume Andre Drazen is here as well. 
 With at least two other shooters, right? 
 Potentially a third, assuming Ellis is dead. 
Here she comes. 
Miss Nash? George Mason, District Director. 
This is Agent Jack Bauer. 
Mr Bauer. Senator Palmer told me about you. 
He said l should do whatever you tell me and l could be sure l'd be in good hands. 
l appreciate that. l have to tell you if you 
wish a lawyer present, you're entitled to that, but we in no way consider you a suspect. 
We just wanna ask you a few questions. 
l don't need a lawyer. 
l'll cooperate in any way l can. 
Come on in. 
 Can l have something to drink? 
 l'll get you a glass of water. 
So... 
how did Alexis Drazen represent himself to you? 
He told me he ran an importing company out of Berlin. 
He seemed successful. 
He gave me this on our third date. 
lt must have cost him $10,000. lt's real, 
which is more than l can say for him. 
 When did you meet him? 
 About a month ago, in DC. 
l'm with the senator's advance team. 
We had some downtime and a few of us went out for drinks. 
So you met him in a bar? 
When you're working on a campaign you basically put your life on hold for a year. 
There's always people around, but it's lonely. 
You're supposed to meet Mr Drazen in his hotel room in about an hour? 
That's right. 
Miss Nash... 
Would you be willing to keep your appointment with Alexis? 
 You want me to spy on him? 
 Well, only if you feel comfortable. 
 lf you have any doubts at all... 
 We'd keep it simple. 
We want you to plant a tracking device on him, so we can trace his locations. 
lt's just the thought of seeing him again. 
We would make it so that we could hear and see everything that took place in that room. 
You would be safe. 
lt's OK. We understand. Jack, you head over 
to the hotel. l'll finish debriefing Miss Nash. 
Yeah. 
Mr Bauer? You say that this 
might help protect the senator? 
Yes, l think it would. 
The senator is safe. He's got Secret Service 
men with him around the clock. 
That didn't stop Alexis from getting to me, did it? And if they got to me, 
they might have got to somebody else. 
l'll do it. lf something happened to Senator 
Palmer that l might have prevented, l could never forgive myself. Please. 
l have to do this. 
He looks familiar too. 
l think l heard them call him Jenson. 
(Paulson) Recognise him? 
How about him? 
You know this one? 
(Kim) Yeah. 
He was one of the guards. 
l think they called him Eli. 
 Can you tell me anything about him? 
 No. 
Daniels, this is Breeher. 
Daniels, this is Breeher. 
(Paulson) These rooms with monitors  they had your father under surveillance? 
 From what l saw. 
 Even at CTU? 
 l don't know. 
 What about you, Mrs Bauer? 
Mrs Bauer? 
 lt's important we get through the questions. 
 Agent Paulson, l think we need a break. 
 My mom's very tired. 
 Yeah, OK. 
Mom, are you OK? 
Mom? 
Ron? 
Ron? 
 Come with me. Go. Go. Shh. Let's go. 
 Mom... 
 Come on. Go. Go. 
 (Kim) Come on. 
ln here. 
Lock the door. 
(clink)  Come out. Hands where l can see them. 
 Don't shoot. l'm coming out. 
 Now! 
 l'm coming out. 
Drop the gun. 
Get down. Down! 
(Teri) Hurry. 
(Kim) Go. Go. Go! Go! Go! 
 (silenced gunshot)  Get down! 
(Kim) Look out! 
Honey, get down! 
We're ready to go, gentlemen. 
l'll fill you in with the rest at the hotel. 
That's where you'll meet the team. 
Don't be nervous. 
l'll be with you every step of the way. 
Jack, l gotta talk to you. 
Secret Service will take you to the helicopter. 
l'll be there in one second. 
What? 
They just found Ellis's body in a men's room in the French Quarter. 
 Do we have any leads yet? 
 No, not yet. 
Keep me posted. 
What are you doing here? 
 l'd no reason to stay. Teri and Kim are fine. 
 l asked you to stay to make them feel safe. 
They are safe. l settled them in. 
Paulson's taking care of them and the extra security team is in place. 
Hang on, Kim. 
 You OK, honey? 
 Yeah. 
l think we lost 'em. l'm just gonna go check. 
l want you to stay right here, OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Stay right here. 
Argh! 
 He's dead, isn't he? Ferragamo's dead. 
 l have no idea. 
 Don't try to blow me off, Carl. 
 The authorities are looking into it. 
 They won't find anything! 
 l've gone through this with your father... 
My father is his own man, and so am l. 
So you can go through it with me! 
Let's just go. What do you need? 
Tell me what you need. 
Ferragamo was there for me when nobody else was. l might not be alive if not for him. 
He also betrayed your confidence, Keith. 
He's the one who went to Maureen Kingsley. 
 That doesn't justify murder. 
 What exactly are you hoping to do? 
 Bring him back to life? 
 l want justice. 
Justice? Well, justice is a tricky thing, Keith. 
Take Lyle Gibson, for example. 
You want justice for that? 
 Gibson's death was an accident. 
 Maybe so, but let's be objective. 
He rapes your sister, you pay him a visit, he ends up dead. Accident could be a tough sell. 
lf l go public with the truth about Ferragamo, you'll go public with a lie about Gibson. 
ls that what you're saying? 
 Oh, brother. 
 There's one catch here, Carl. 
There are two cover-ups and you're involved in both. However it plays out, it's bad for you. 
 l can take care of myself. 
 No. 
The moneymen behind my father's campaign take care of you. 
But if things get ugly they'll make sure you're the one who takes the fall, won't they, Carl? 
Or maybe they'll do to you what you did to Dr Ferragamo. 
You are in way over your head. 
And you're getting nervous. l can smell it. 
OK, you listen to me. Whatever you think 
you can do, to me or anyone else, it'll be a hundred times worse for you. 
 l'm not so sure. 
 Well, l am. 
Because if you push things too far, they will do whatever they have to do. 
Killing David Palmer's son might get messy. 
Oh, l think they'd be a little more subtle than that. 
l'm not following you. 
There is some physical evidence in George Ferragamo's office that leads directly to you. 
Subtle enough so the fire marshals didn't find it the first time. 
But with a little help, they'll find it. 
 So l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder? 
 Like l said, whatever it takes. 
That's why your father backed off, and that's why you'll back off. 
(tape rewinds) (Keith) l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder? 
(Carl) Like l said, whatever it takes. 
That's whyyour father backed off, and that's whyyou'll back off. 
(click) Hey. 
Are you OK? 
What happened? 
What's your name? 
l don't remember. 
You don't even know your name? 
Well, you can't stand in the middle of the road. 
Come on, get in. l'll give you a ride. 
Thank you. 
l'm sorry. Thank you. 
Mom! 
Mom! 
(Jack) There are terrorists planning to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped. 
And the people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer. 
This is the longest day ofmy life. 
(radio) This is Dave Thompson. 
lt's 9 o'clock on primary day in Southern California and the freeways are looking pretty good. 
Usual delays in the Sepulveda Pass southbound, but it loosens up at Culver. 
We'll have a complete report in six minutes. Back to you, Bill. 
(Bill) Thanks, Dave. ln the news, we haven't 
learned any more about the incident at the San Clarita power plant where Senator Palmer was rushed out this morning, but we're told the senator was unharmed. 
But Secret Service and the FBl haven't released any new information. 
 (medic #1) Get the drip. 
 (medic #2) l'm on it. 
(medic #1) Find me a pulse. 
(medic #2) l've got a pulse. 140 over 30. 
Pupils not reactive. 
(medic #1) Respiration shallow. 48. 
Let's start two large-bore lVs, bilateral. 
She's lost a lot of blood. 
 (medic #2) We should start the other line. 
 (medic #1) All right. 
(medic #2) ls it in? 
(medic #1) Ready? One, two, three. 
Ready? 
Lift. 
Excuse me. 
(medic #1) l've got the door. 
Everyone, l'm sorry to tell you Jamey Farrell tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago. 
Fortunately, she's still alive, and they're doing everything they can to keep her that way. 
l know it won't be easy to put this out of our minds, but we don't have a choice. 
We still believe that Palmer's life is in danger, which means we all have to get back to work now. 
 You wanna look at this? 
 Not now. Call Jamey's mom. 
Explain what happened. 
Have her pick up Kyle. 
(phone rings)  CTU, Myers. 
 Hey, it's me. Hold on. 
 OK. 
 Didyou get the car? 
Yes, and l got the care package too. Thanks. 
 Jack, Teri called. 
 What? 
 About 20 minutes ago. 
 Where is she? What did she say? 
l don't know. She barely said her name 
before she got disconnected. 
What happened? 
She didn't call back, and when l tried to redial, the number was blocked. 
 She sounded all right. 
 The police have thrown a net over this area. 
There's no way l can help Teri until l get through it. 
Maybe you should turn yourself in, tell your side of the story. 
No. Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive 
as long as he thinks l can be useful to him. 
ln custody l won't be. 
Scan the police frequencies. 
 See ifyou can locate any ofthe roadblocks. 
 All right. 
Just a minute. 
 OK. 
 Jamey give you anything else? 
Jack... 
Jamey tried to kill herself. 
Jack? Didyou hear me? 
 Jack? 
 Yeah. You said she tried? 
We sent her to County, but it doesn't look good. 
 Are you sure it was a suicide attempt? 
 Yeah. She slit her wrists. 
 Where is her son Kyle? 
 He didn't see anything. 
We've already called Jamey's mom. 
She's on her way to pick him up. 
OK. Send someone down to County 
to question Jamey in case she makes it. 
 She's still our best source ofinformation. 
 OK. 
 Dammit. 
 What? What's wrong? 
They set up a roadblock at Montana. 
Nina, l could have used a heads-up here. 
l'm sorry. They must have set it up 
before l started scanning. 
 Find me another route. 
 Give me a second to pull up LA traffic. 
OK. You go to the window. 
You let me know if somebody comes. 
(dials phone) (ringing tone) (phone rings)  Tony. Line three. Can you get it? 
 Almeida. 
OK. lt looks like roadblocks 
aren't your only problem. 
They sent a description ofyou to all the units in the area. 
Nina. lt's Teri Bauer. 
Jack, hold on a minute. 
 Teri. 
 Nina. Thank God. 
 Where are you? 
 l don't know, but l got a hold of a phone. 
OK. ls Kim with you? Are you all right? 
l'm fine. Kimberly's fine. 
You know where Jack is? 
Listen, l'm gonna connect you with him right now. 
Leave the line open as long as you can so we can do a trace. Understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Have Milo set up the trace on line three. 
 Jack, l've got Teri. 
 Patch her through. 
Mom, someone's coming. 
 He's here. 
 Teri? Teri? 
What do you want from us? 
l think l left my phone in here. 
Have you seen it? 
No, l haven't. 
(Nina) Jack, l've muted our conversation. 
 Have you set up a trace? 
 Yeah. l told Teri to leave the line open. 
Good. Keep our side muted. 
l don't wanna give away this phone. 
You better not be lyin', bitch. 
Bitch. 
They moved everything around in here! 
Dammit! Rick, you seen it anywheres? 
No. No. 
Got anything on that trace? 
Latitude is north of the 10. l should have 
a rough longitude in a couple of minutes, though triangulating the longitude is gonna be trickier. 
(radio) This is Dave Thompson. 
We're seeing congestion in North Hollywood around the Grant Street Elementary School. 
Senator Palmer is due to make an appearance there and quite a few supporters and media are hoping to catch a glimpse ofthe candidate who is not letting this morning's incident interfere with his schedule today. 
(Sherry) l don't understand the rationale behind it. No, listen to me. Why? 
Why defend something that you don't need to defend? 
Maureen won't come out with the story today. 
 She will. 
 We don't know that. 
Look, if not now, tomorrow. 
lf not her, someone else. 
Our son is accused of murder. 
 The story's too big to hide. 
 Mike. 
He's right, Sherry. We need to control 
when and how this story comes out. 
One hour ago someone tried to kill my husband. 
That bought us time and we should use it. 
The assassination attempt might even work for us if we break the story about Keith. 
lt might put the public in a more forgiving frame of mind. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 lt's mine to make. 
No, it isn't, David, because you didn't get here by yourself. 
Do not go against me on this, Sherry. 
Promise me. 
l can't promise you anything. 
(screaming and applause) Jack, we've got a preliminary read on the trace. lt's a pretty big area. 
 l'm listening. 
 lt's north of the 10, east of the 405. 
Didyou hear me? 
Jack? 
Well, that's a start. 
Now get me through these cops. 
Your best bet is east on Thurston. 
But l don't think you should be moving yet. 
l'll get through the net somehow. Just stay on 
that trace and help me find my family, please. 
Tony, open an extra socket for me on one. 
 Did you hear me? 
 Come here. You gotta check this out. 
 What is it? 
 l checked Jamey's disk for recent emails. 
She was pretty careful, but she must not have had time to get rid of this one. 
 That's from this morning. 
 Mmhm. To an anonymous recipient. 
 What about the encryption? 
 l'll get Milo on it. You can see the subject. 
Ted Cofell? Coffell? Find out who he is. 
(phone rings) l'm busy. 
(phone rings) Yeah. 
 l need you to do something. 
 l'm working on this trace. 
You're gonna have to do two things at once. 
l need this email decrypted. 
(phone rings) CTU, Almeida. 
OK. 
Thanks. 
Nina. 
That was the clinic. Jamey didn't make it. 
 Mom, it's clear. They're gone. 
 Hello, Jack? Are you there? 
 Teri? lt's Nina. Are you OK to talk? 
 Uhhuh. 
l'll put you through to Jack. 
Jack, l've got Teri. 
 Teri? 
 Jack. Can you talk? Where are you? 
 l'm on my way to get you out. Are you OK? 
 l'm hangin' in there. 
Good. Thank God. Nina's tracing 
the cellular signal to your location. 
 How long will that take to find it? 
 Nina? 
20 minutes. Milo's narrowed 
the signal to four antennas, which is still about 500 square miles. 
 God. 
 (Nina) Don't worry. We're closing in on it. 
(siren) Will you please pull over to the kerb? 
 (Teri) Jack? 
 No, l'm still here, honey. 
ls there anything you can tell us that might help us find you? 
l know we're at least a few miles out of the city. 
Look, this is gonna take me about a minute, OK? Hold on. 
(siren) 11-8-19. Code 6 North. 
11-8-9. l'm Code 6 South, heading your way. 
Copy. 
11-8-19. North sector. Nothing so far. 
Jack, are you all right? 
Jack? 
Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine. 
Honey, it'd really help if you could tell us everything you know about where you are. 
l don't know. They blindfolded me 
when they picked me up. 
 Where was that? 
 Mulholland, near Coldwater. 
How long did it take to get from there to where you are now? 
l'm not sure. Halfan hour? 
 Streets or freeways? 
 Freeways, l think. 
 Milo. 
 Already on it. 
Anything else? Any sounds or smells? 
 Can you hear cars or airplanes? Anything? 
 No, it's pretty quiet. 
There's hills and, um, some eucalyptus trees. 
lt may be in the north valley, somewhere inland. lt's pretty remote. 
That helps. All right, l got it narrowed down 
to three sectors, but check it out. 
OK, the closer we get, the longer each iteration's gonna take. 
(Teri) What does that mean? 
lt's just techno talk, Teri. 
Don't worry. We're making good progress. 
Jack? Are you there? 
Yeah, baby. l'm still here. 
Teri, l'm gonna find you. l promise. 
l know you will. 
Nina's tracing the call right now. We'll have 
your location in just a couple of minutes, but it's really important you don't hang up, OK? Even if you can't talk, don't hang up. 
Sweetheart, are you sure you're all right? 
They didn't hurt you, did they? 
l'm fine. So's Kim. 
 ls she there with you? 
 Yeah, she's right here. 
Put her on the phone so both of you can hear. 
OK. 
 Dad? 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
Are you OK? 
Yeah. Who are these guys? 
Why are they doing this? 
l don't know, honey, but l'm gonna find out. 
But right now l just wanna make sure that you and Mommy get home safely, OK? 
Honey... 
Look, uh... l know l haven't always been there 
for you when you've needed me and... 
 Jack, you don't have to do this. 
 l want both of you to know that... 
l'm here for you now. l love you more 
than anything in the whole world, and l promise you l am gonna getyou both out ofthere. OK? 
So no matter what happens, don't give up. 
We're a family. We're gonna 
get through this like a family. 
OK? 
So don't forget l'm coming to get you. 
Sweetheart? 
Stay on the phone. l'm gonna be right back. 
 You still there? 
 Mom, he's coming back. 
 Jack, l have to go. He's coming back. 
 Who's coming? Teri, keep the line open. 
lt's just a phone! 
lt's how Gaines gets ahold of me when he needs me. 
You already looked here! 
 Where is it? 
 l told you. l don't know. 
 Where's my phone? 
 She doesn't know either. 
 (Eli) Can'tyou speak foryourself? 
 (Teri) Stay away from her! Don't touch her. 
 Can't you speak? 
 l don't know where you left your phone. 
Don't hurt her, man! Come on. Take it easy! 
(phone beeps) (phone beeps)  Nina, what's going on? 
 l don't know. 
The signal's dying. 
(phone beeps) (phone beeps) Who'd you call? 
Who is this? 
l'm the last thing that you will ever see if anything happens to my wife or my daughter. 
 Where you going? 
 To tell Gaines. 
What do you think he's gonna do when he finds out they used your phone? 
(Teri) Jack, get us out of here, please! Hurry! 
Teri, l'm gonna find you, l promise. Teri... 
(phone beeps) Think about it. They called on your phone. 
Nina? 
Tell me you got that trace. 
We didn't get it. 
 We've located Bauer's car. 
 (radio) The number matches? 
That's right. 
(starts car)  Nina, it's Jack. You still there? 
 What's happening? 
l got a car. How close 
did Milo get with the trace? 
25-mile radius. 
 Dammit. That's not good enough. 
 Sorry. 
l've gotta do something. Come on, anything. 
Please, help me out. What about Jamey? 
 She didn't make it, Jack. 
 l don't believe this. Nina, please. 
 l've got to find them. 
 Hold on. 
 Anything yet with that email address? 
 lt's coming now. 
Patch into line two. 
lt's Tony. l found something 
on Jamey's computer that might be a lead. 
 What? 
 lt's a name. Ted Cofell. 
l did a search of LA and found him as a CEO of an investment banking firm in Burbank. 
That's it? 
 So... 
 There's... 
Hold on. Speak one at a time. 
Tony, you go first. 
So far that's it, but we got Milo decoding the email right now. We should have more soon. 
OK, fine. l'm gonna head over 
to Cofell's office. What's the address? 
 lt's 21500, Riverside Drive. 
 21500, Riverside Drive. Fine. 
Tony, Gaines'll try and contact Jamey. 
He doesn't know she's dead. 
You make sure you keep it that way. 
 Nina, you help me navigate through traffic. 
 All right. 
(phone rings)  Gaines. 
 Hello, lra. 
 Mr Drazen. Where are you? 
 Flying into Los Angeles. 
l'd like to know why the David Palmer situation hasn't been taken care of. 
l don't have to tell you my brother and l are very disappointed. 
 We had some bad luck, that's all. 
 Bad luck or bad management? 
 We have every reason to void the contract. 
 There's no need for that. 
To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer in the same city on the same day and let them slip through our fingers would be intolerable. 
Don't worry. Palmer will be dead 
by the end of the day, just as we agreed. 
How? 
We still have Bauer's family as leverage. 
We'll find Bauer and use him just like we did before. 
lf plan A doesn't work, you should have a plan B, not plan A recycled. 
Like l said, we still have his family. 
lf we sit tight, there's a good chance Bauer will find us. 
Then we'll make him the scapegoat just as before. 
My brother wants me to assess the situation personally. 
l land in half an hour. 
 l'll join you by 10.30. 
 Suit yourself. 
lf l don't see a substantial improvement in things in the next hour, l'm going to ask Mr Cofell to empty the accounts. 
You will get zero. 
 Mr Drazen... 
 lra... 
you may be in this for the money, but for my family it's personal. 
 l realise that. 
 Then realise this. 
lf things continue to go wrong, the money isn't all you'll lose. Do you understand? 
 This is Sherry Palmer. 
 Hello. 
l'm sure you're as surprised as l am that l'm calling you. 
l'm surprised you waited this long. l assume 
you're calling because David still plans to make the announcement about Keith and you can't stop him, so nowyou want me to stop him? 
You've lost whatever influence you once had with David, so l'm sure that's gonna be a problem, but you might be able to stop Maureen Kingsley. 
 How? 
 l don't know. 
l'm sure she has a weakness somewhere. 
Look, Carl, you don't need to ask me for any advice on stufflike this. 
As a matter of fact, l'm already taking care of the evidence against Keith. 
Taking care of it? How? 
That's allyou really need to know. 
 l'm not sure l'm understanding you. 
 You don't have to. 
But, Sherry, if we give David a way out of this, make sure he takes it. 
 Got it. 
 Send it to me. 
There was a wire transfer to lra Gaines at 2.10am from a Swiss account. 
 One million dollars. 
 What does Cofell have to do with this? 
 l don't know. Maybe it was his money. 
 Makes sense. Cofell's in finance. 
(phone rings)  Yeah, it's Jack. 
 (Nina) Looks like we have the right Cofell. 
Good. What have you got on him? 
He was born in Philadelphia, went to Colgate, MBA from UCLA in '88, worked in investment banking, started his own firm about five years ago. 
His net worth is in excess of35 million. 
 OK. Good. Patch me through to his office. 
 OK. 
(phone rings)  Cofell Enterprises. 
 Hi. ls Ted there? 
He's in a meeting. May l take a message? 
l'm a friend from business school. 
l'm in town. l hoped we could get together. 
As soon as he's out of the meeting he's going out of town. 
That's too bad. How much longer 
will he be in his office? 
He plans to leave by ten. 
Wouldyou like to leave your name? 
(phone beeps) Hello? 
(Nina) Tell Milo to be ready in case Teri calls back. 
Look, Nina, Division gave me a heads-up. 
They're sending in a provisional replacement for Jack. 
They didn't waste any time, did they? 
Who is it? 
Alberta Green. Didn't she work for you 
when you were over at Division? 
 Yes, she did. When's she coming? 
 Scheduled to arrive at 9.45. 
(phone rings) OK. 
 CTU. Myers. 
 Cofell's there, but he's gonna leave at ten. 
l'm passing Culver. 
How's the traffic moving east? 
l'll check. 
Jack, there's another thing. 
They're bringing in Alberta Green to run things. 
 She's gonna be here in a few minutes. 
 Dammit. 
Whatever. We'll deal with it. 
Now, tell me how to get out of this traffic. 
 You'll hit gridlock in about two miles. 
 How's Riverside? 
lt's a little better. You might wanna get off. 
OK, look. l'll get off 
at the next exit and cut over. 
Mom, tell me what happened between you and Dad. 
Why'd he move out? 
 Kim, let's not talk about this now. 
 Why not? 
l mean, we both know there might not be a later. 
 Kim... 
 Please, Mom. 
l wanna know. 
l think your father is the best man that l've ever known. 
But he can be... difficult. 
And his job doesn't help. 
You remember a couple of years ago when he went away for a few weeks? 
Uh... 
for some training thing. 
That's what he told us, but l'm sure it was a mission. 
He wouldn't say and maybe he probably couldn't. 
Anyway, when he came back, he was... different. 
He was distant and... preoccupied 
and other times he was just angry. 
He did everything he could to keep it from you. 
But things between us weren't so great. 
l suppose l could have been more patient. 
So we decided to try being apart. 
But it didn't work. 
No. 
Good. 
l just want us to be together again. 
Cofell's taking a private plane and we got a copy of his flight plan from the FAA. 
 He's going to Denver. 
 What does that tell us? 
We're not sure. We're checking 
people in the Denver area who have known terrorist connections. 
So far we haven't got much. 
 Hello, Nina. 
 Hello, Alberta. 
 Nice to see you. You know why l'm here. 
 Yes. 
Gather everyone around, will you? 
OK. Could everyone stop what they're doing 
for a moment? l have something to tell you. 
l'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green. 
Jack Bauer's been relieved of his duties here indefinitely. 
ln the meantime, Alberta's been appointed Acting Director of CTU. 
Good morning. 
Things have been out of control here today. 
Starting now, they're back in control. 
Most of you know that an attempt was made on Senator Palmer at about 8am. 
You may not know that Jack Bauer was apparently involved in that attempt. 
The nature of his involvement isn't clear, but he has escaped custody and is considered a fugitive. 
We therefore have two objectives: Find Jack Bauer, and make a quick and accurate assessment of the threat, if any, facing Senator Palmer. 
l know most of you have been up more than 24 hours. 
Too bad. Nobody so much as yawns 
until we accomplish our objective. 
lf anybody has a problem with that, now would be a good time to resign. 
Good. Let's get back to work. 
Specific assignments will be confirmed or revised within the hour. 
Obviously this is awkward, but we'll get through this. We're pros. 
 Of course. 
 We'll talk later. 
(phone rings) Hold on a minute. 
 (boy) ls it really true you played basketball? 
 l sure did. Georgetown. 
 My daddy says Georgetown sucks. 
 l need to have a little talk with your daddy. 
My daddy also says there will never be a black president in this country, ever. 
Would you give your daddy a message for me? 
Tell him l understand where he's coming from, but he's wrong, and l'm gonna prove it. 
 Tell him that, OK? 
 OK. 
 l have Frank Ames on the phone. 
 What does he want? 
 He wouldn't tell me. 
 l'll call him back. 
He said it was urgent. 
He's your biggest contributor. 
You can't just blow him off. 
l'm very sorry. 
Would you excuse me for a minute? 
(girl) OK. 
Frank. This is kind of a bad time. 
 Well, it's about to get worse. 
 What do you mean? 
l just got out of a meeting with Carl, Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen. 
 About what? 
 George Ferragamo, your son's therapist. 
''The freshman and the transfers from school are...'' 
The three of you have given a lot of money to my campaign, but my son's therapist is none ofyour business. 
He is when he's accusing your son of murder. 
He's a problem, and Tuttle and Jorgensen don't like problems. 
They told Carl to get rid ofit, permanently. 
 l've played hardball all my life, but this... 
 What are you saying? They told Carl to... 
Listen, l'm washing my hands of this and your whole campaign. 
 Frank... 
 l am out of it, David. 
What was that about? 
l need to talk to Carl, now. 
You wanted to see me? 
 Give us five minutes. 
 Certainly. 
l don't know where Jack is. 
We haven't talked since this morning. 
 Since he escaped with a hostage? 
 That's right. 
l'm not sure l believe you. 
lf you tell me where he is, l'll do what l can to make sure nothing heavy falls on you. 
l told you. l don't know. 
From what l've heard, there are very few secrets between you and Jack. 
Jack doesn't trust anyone, including me. 
Getting involved with Jack was one of the biggest mistakes l've ever made. 
Not that l'm judging you, Nina, but there's a right way to do these things. 
Let 'em screw you. 
Don't let 'em screw you over. 
Look, if you don't have any more pearls of wisdom, l'd like to get back to work. 
By all means. 
 Cofell Enterprises. 
 lt's Ted's friend from business school. 
l'm sorry, but l'm in the building. l hoped 
l could come up and say a quick hello. 
 Will Ted be there for a few more minutes? 
 l'm sorry, sir. He's on his way out. 
 What floor is Cofell Enterprises on? 
 14. 
Thank you. 
 Nancy, could you call my car, please? 
 OK. 
Better head to the airport a little early today. 
The radio said the traffic was slow. 
Of course. Mr Cofell, a friend of yours from 
business school is on the way up to see you. 
On his way now? 
 l tried to stop him. 
 Did he say who it was? 
He didn't give his name. 
He's probably selling something. 
 Don't give him my cell number. 
 Have a good trip. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't forget your phone. 
Hey, Lewis, just wanted to let you know that Mr Cofell is on his way down. 
Excuse me. Where's Mr Cofell? 
Oh, l'm so sorry. 
He just stepped into the elevator. 
Where was he going? Down to 
the parking garage? lt's all right, never mind. 
(alarm sounds) Nothing to worry about. There's a 30-second 
reset, then we continue down automatically. 
lt's probably a false alarm anyhow. 
 Excuse me. Are you Mr Cofell's driver? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
l'm a federal agent. 
Where are you going today? 
 To the airport. 
 On what business? 
Look, l'm just his driver. 
ls there a problem here? 
Come with me a second. 
Thank you. 
 Have a nice day, Mr Cofell. 
 Thank you. 
Valet. 
Mark, could you turn the air on back here, please? 
''Then they began to laugh.'' 
''They began to say things like 'Oh, you remember him, don't you?''' 
'''Doesn't he live with you? Sure he does.''' 
(Teri groans)  Are you OK? 
 Yeah, l'm fine. lt's nothing. 
 He hurt you, didn't he? 
 No, no, honey. l'm fine. 
Excuse me. Hello? 
(both) Hello? 
Hello? Excuse me. Hello? 
Excuse me. There was 
a teenage girl in an accident. 
 A teenage girl in a traffic accident. 
 l'll be right with you. 
 We just called. There was a traffic accident. 
 Certainly. You have our fax number? 
 Excuse me. 
 Thank you. You're welcome. 
Doctor, did you get the message about the heart seminar? 
 Yes, l did. 
 There was a car accident. 
 Sorry. My shift starts at four. l just got here. 
 Please help me. 
 A teenage girl, traffic accident. 
 The name? 
 Kimberly Bauer or Janet York. 
 Bauer. York. 
No name listed. Just a Jane Doe. 
 Well, maybe... 
 Hey! You can't go in there! 
Oh, my God. Janet. 
l'm sure you're gonna find Kim. 
(mobile phone rings)  Hello. 
 Honey, it's me. 
Jack, l've been trying to reach you. 
 Have you found Kim yet? 
 No. We're at St Mark's Hospital. 
 Hospital? 
 Kim's friend, Janet, was in a car accident. 
 And Kim? 
 l don't know. She tried to call me. 
She was in a panic, like she was in trouble, and l tried to get her, but we were stopped by a cop... 
Teri, Teri, Teri, calm down. 
 l'm losing my mind. l need you here. 
 l know, sweetheart. 
l'm gonna get there as soon as l can. Where 
was Kim when she called the second time? 
l... l don't know. She was... uh... 
North Hollywood. 
lt sounded like she was being chased, and then when we got there, she was gone. 
 Kim's friend, Janet. Let me speak to her. 
 She's in surgery. 
Surgery? ls she gonna make it? 
 l don't know. 
 Listen to me, Teri. 
What l'm trying to do right now is to find Kim. 
Stay where you are, and l will get there as soon as l can. 
What do you mean? l've been trying to find 
Kim. l've been out all night trying to find Kim. 
Teri, l'm gonna explain it to you later, OK? 
You're gonna have to trust me. 
Teri? Honey, l love you. 
l promise you, we're gonna get through this, OK? 
l love you too, Jack. 
l'll get back to you as soon as l know anything. 
(Kim sobs) Yeah, she's here. They say 
the other one's dead. Don't worry. l will. 
OK. Change of plan. Drive to the compound. 
You'll get your money there. 
 No problem. 
 Use a different route. 
 l don't want us to look like a caravan. 
 Right. OK. 
 Let's just split. 
 Are you crazy? We have 20 large coming. 
 l don't like it. This guy's psycho. 
 You're forgetting something. 
Last month? Phoenix? You owe me. 
So let's get the money, then split. All right? 
Mm-hm. This is fine, Patty. 
We'll finish it after the breakfast. Still got 
a couple of hours to grab some sleep. 
Only if you do. 
l made mochas. 
Hey. l thought you were down. 
l'm up. l couldn't sleep. 
The polls open in less than three hours... 
Mr President-To-Be. 
 Heavy on the caffeine for me. Patty? 
 Nothin' for me. Thanks. 
 Mom? 
 No. 
You look exhausted. 
Go to bed. That's an order. 
All right. Promise you'll wake me 
if you need anything? 
 Absolutely. 
 OK. 
 Night. 
 Good night. 
David. 
You won't say anything to Nicole about Keith, will you? 
We don't even know whether Maureen Kingsley's going to go forward with the story. 
 l have to, Sherry. 
 Why? 
Because the press is gonna get a hold of this, whether it's today, tomorrow or next week. 
 Nicole should be prepared. 
 l thought you said Carl would take care of it. 
He'll do what he can, but l don't want her to suddenly hear something on the news. 
 She'd be devastated. 
 She's so happy right now, David. 
We've gotta take it one step at a time. 
(Nicole) Dad, it's ready. 
Dad, l've figured it all out. Even if we lose 
Orange County, we're still gonna win. 
lf we win Ventura by a ten per cent margin. 
No. Even seven. 
lt's all right there in last night's poll. 
You make it look like there's nothing to worry about. 
That's because there is nothing to worry about. 
 Mm. Dad... 
 Nicole... 
 No, go ahead. 
 No, no, no. You first. 
l talked to Suzy and Rachel Brenner. They're 
flying out. l invited them to the victory party. 
My Lord. l haven't seen them 
since you all were in high school. 
Well, we're gonna see them tomorrow. 
Actually, tonight. 
Ah, that's great. What were you gonna say? 
Nothin'. 
 CTU, this is Myers. 
 (Jack) Mason looking overyour shoulder? 
No. He ended the lockdown 
as soon as he found out where you were. 
Be careful. He'll come after you. 
l'm at the precinct. They've got a ring 
around the suspect. l need help. 
Get Ryan Sealey over at District. 
Say it's about Palmer and l need an override. 
OK. l'll take care of it. 
Damn it. 
Tony, l'm still off the net. l need a contact 
number for Ryan Sealey at District Two. 
Sure. 
You still pissed off about the lockdown? 
Jack's never gonna trust you again, and l'm not sure l will either. 
You don't trust me, but you trust Jack? 
Come on, Nina. He's been lying. 
He's been hiding things from us. 
lt may be OK for you, but it's not OK for me. 
Do you have the number? 
Thank you. 
Sorry, but this guy killed a cop. 
l won't interfere with booking protocol. 
l told you - you'll get a call from Ryan Sealey, our liaison to the PD's office. 
Until then, you can have my badge, my gun, and l will not interfere. 
 But l need to see that man now. 
 What can l tell you? 
 Fine. Where's your lieutenant? 
 He checked out. Midnight. 
But if he was here, he'd tell you the same thing. 
Sergeant, the cop that was killed tonight, Officer Hampton. Did you know her? 
 l knew her. 
 l'm investigating a federal case. 
She was helping me. 
Do you want her death to be in vain? 
Please forget about the damn chain of command. l need to see this man now. 
Just for a few minutes. Please. 
Where's the suspect? 
Move him to room two. 
 Thank you. 
 Follow me. 
Hold it, Sergeant. 
This man's under my authority. 
We shouldn't have let him take her! There's 
two of us, one of him, and we got a gun. 
 You don't wanna pull a piece on Mr Gaines. 
 No? Just on girls? 
lf you had the hots for her, then you should have done something. 
l just don't want her to get hurt. 
Get real, dude. 
She saw our faces. She saw his face. 
She's not walking. She never was. 
 You think he's gonna kill her? 
 Maybe he already has. 
Rick. Dude. Come on. lt's ten grand apiece. 
All right? We just wanna get paid 
and get going. Forget Kimberly, man. 
She's history. 
Listen, till you can tell me what you were doing at Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh,  l'm treating you as a prime suspect. 
 Why would l kill my only ally at the agency? 
You tell me. Why'd you blow the whistle on 
your own agents, and try to blackmail me? 
Because you were withholding vital information. 
l was following orders. l realise that's 
a concept you may be unfamiliar with, Jack, but it's something that some of us actually do take seriously. 
Through there is a suspect who is connected with the people who want Palmer dead. 
How do you know? 
Walsh and Baylor died because they got information that led me to him. 
And if you interfere now and something happens to Palmer, you'll be seen as impeding this investigation cos of a grudge against me, so cut the crap. 
 How do you wanna play this? 
 (knock at door) l'll talk to him myself. 
Look, you're lucky l haven't already put you in cuffs. Just sit down. 
(mobile phone rings)  Gaines. 
 Have you heard from him? 
No. l'm gonna be calling him in about 
15 minutes. He should be done by then. 
l've got the girl and we're on our way to the compound right now. 
Gotta go. 
Stop, please. 
Listen, l don't have time for this, you understand? 
 Maureen, it's David Palmer. 
 Senator? 
 l'm sorry to wake you. 
 Oh, no, no, that's OK. What's up? 
 The matter you called about earlier. 
 Mmhm. 
 We need to talk about it. 
 OK. Um... let's talk. 
Since we're just a few floors apart, l was thinking maybe we could get together. 
 OK. How about l meetyou in the lobby? 
 No, no. The lobby's too public. 
The conference room on the third floor  l'll have it opened. 
ljust need about ten minutes to get dressed. 
How does that sound? 
 Yeah, that's good. 
 l'll see you in ten. 
 Thanks, Maureen. 
 Sure. 
And those are the only places you know they were? 
Yes. 
What about this boy, uh, Dan, who works at the furniture store? 
We don't know anything about him, but the store owner's a Mr Nowrasteh. 
l have his number in here somewhere. 
 Here you are. 
 (mobile phone rings) Excuse me. 
 Hello? 
 Hey, it's me. ls Janet out of surgery yet? 
Yeah. The police showed up. 
We're talking to them now. 
 Anything new? 
 No. How about you? 
l'm at the Van Nuys police station. Someone 
here knows where the girls were tonight. 
 You mean one of the police officers? 
 No. They picked him up in North Hollywood. 
 l think he saw Kim. 
 Who? 
 l don't know. A man. 
 Well, what did he say? 
l'm waiting to talk to him. You've gotta talk to 
Janet as soon as she gets out of surgery, OK? 
l know. l know, l know. 
l'll call you as soon as l can. l gotta go. Bye. 
 So what did he say? 
 (sighs) He says he won't talk to anybody except you. 
So, can l go in? 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
My colleague said you only wanted to speak to me. 
Well, here l am. And guess what? 
 Right now, you're speaking to everyone. 
 What the hell is he doing? 
 l thought we were going to talk alone. 
 You killed a cop. 
What you need to do right now is start telling me the truth. 
 lt was selfdefence. You were chasing me. 
 (whispers) What's he saying? 
Go to hell! l'm done talking. 
Get this guy outta my face! 
 You've got nothing. l want my lawyer! 
 Settle down. 
 l'll take him. 
 Come on. 
l want my phone call. You've got nothing! 
 l want my phone call, now! 
 Jack. Great job. 
 He knows something. 
 So are you gonna beat it out of him? 
What's the plan, Jack? Hm? What's the plan? 
Take a walk. 
(mobile phone rings)  Bauer. 
 ls this line safe? 
 Tell me about my daughter. 
 Not till you get me out. 
 How do you know where she is? 
 l heard some guys talking. Guys l work with. 
 What guys? 
 All you need to know is they have her. 
 They're gonna call me in 20 minutes. 
 Where? 
 Back where you first saw me. 
 San Fernando Road? 
Yeah. But if l don't answer, they'll know 
something's wrong, so get me out. 
 l don't know if l can. 
 l'm the one chance you got to find her. 
l'm not there for that call, the chance is over. 
Better think ofsomething fast. 
 CTU. This is Myers. 
 Hey. lt's Jack. 
The suspect's name is Penticoff. 
He's expecting a call in 20 minutes at 18166 San Fernando Road. 
l need you to trace all available public lines. 
 l see water lines, utilities, no phone lines. 
 Keep looking. He said he'd get the call there. 
Wait. There's a pay phone 
halfway down the block. 
 And it's in service. 
 Set up a trace. 
 There's not enough time for a warrant. 
 Forget the warrant! 
lf they're expecting Penticoff, they'll hang up when they hear your voice. 
 They won't. They'll hear Penticoff's. 
 Did Mason get him out? 
 No. 
 So what are you planning? Ajailbreak? 
Jack? 
Set up the trace. 
(Mason) Bauer's behaviour is far from representative of this agency's work. 
Whether you like it or not, we have to be involved, because this is bigger than... 
Hey. Are you the officer 
that interviewed Penticoff? 
 No, l just transferred him to a holding cell. 
 l still need to see him. 
 You Bauer from CTU? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
Look, the cop that he killed, she was my partner, you understand? 
 l'm sorry. 
 l heard you went off on him before. 
l want him to go down for it, which means a clean bust. 
 No more extracurricular activities. 
 Understood. 
All right. But l've got the access card. 
Now, you can go in with me... 
or you don't go in. 
l'm fine with that. 
 Keep him away from me. 
 Just a few more questions. 
No more questions without my lawyer. 
 Who are you working for? 
 Are you deaf? 
l said no questions without my lawyer. 
 Your lawyer can kiss my ass. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Who do you work for? 
 Hey, hey! Back off! 
 Get your hands off of me. 
 He killed my partner! 
 l know. l was there. Where were you? 
 What? 
Where were you when your partner really needed you? 
Hey! 
Get him outta here! 
 What the hell's the matter with you? 
 He's crazy. l'm filing charges. 
You oughta get yourself under control, Bauer. 
(man) What's going on? l'll take care of it. 
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery. 
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery. 
l'm sorry. l... l didn't mean to wake you. 
 l wasn't asleep. 
 l thought you might like some coffee. 
Thank you. 
 She'll turn up. 
 How's Janet? 
Um... 
They're relieving some pressure on her spine. 
But she's gonna be OK. 
At least, that's what they say. 
Of course she will. 
Any news from Jack? 
No. As far as l know, 
he's still out looking for Kim. 
Well, that's good. You said he has 
resources the police don't have, right? 
Even so, um... 
l imagine you wish he were here. 
Hands out, please. 
 Turn around. 
 Oh, enough. Maureen's an old friend. 
 lt's all right. He's just doing his job. 
 Thank you. 
Your lD, ma'am. 
Would you excuse us? 
How long have we known each other, Maureen? 
Come on, Senator. That's not fair. 
No, l'm just saying. 
You, me, my family. 
We made a journey together, from local politics to where we are now. 
We helped each other along, because we cared about the same things. 
 l know that. 
 Have l ever lied to you? 
 No. 
 Embarrassed you? 
 No. 
 Then why are you doing this? 
Senator, l wish to God that l didn't get this information. 
 But we're talking about murder. 
 A rumour. 
Started by my enemies, of whom, as you well know, l have many. 
That's what l thought too, at first. But... 
Please. Go on. 
 You know l can't tell you my sources. 
 Come on, Maureen. 
We're not in court here. l'm just an old friend, 
with a career and family that you just may destroy. 
You owe me that much, at least. 
OK. 
Two sources. 
One, a man named George Ferragamo. 
He was your son's therapist for four years. 
He came to me with the story. 
And the second source? 
The boy who raped your daughter, then threw himself off the balcony - Lyle Gibson? 
His autopsy showed that he had cuts and scratches that pointed to ''a violent struggle''. 
Nicole tried to fight him off. 
Yes, that was the explanation. 
But an hour later, an African-American teenage boy went to an emergency room, one block away, with similar injuries. 
The name here says Edward Johnson. 
The handwriting where he filled out the form and signed his name? 
l had it analysed by an expert. 
lt's your son's. 
l don't give a damn about your expert. 
My son never killed anybody. 
 Senator, l would never... 
 You do what you have to do, Maureen. 
Just be prepared to accept the consequences. 
(TV) ..truth in the rumour that the Pentagon 
wastefully dumped military supplies costing millions, perhaps billions, oftaxpayer dollars in the years since the Vietnam War started. 
The spokesman, who declined to be interviewed on camera, states only that ''in the hurly-burly ofwar and the constant movement ofperimeters and people, one must expect that there would be a certain amount ofacceptable loss ofsupplies and armaments.'' 
Hey, Dad. 
Somethin' wrong? 
l guess you'll have to tell me. 
The night your sister was raped, did you have any contact with the boy who raped her? 
 What? 
 You heard me. 
l... l don't believe this. l mean... 
What brought this up all of a sudden? 
l mean, let's just leave that all in the past where it belongs. 
l'd like to, believe me. 
But, as it happens, l can't. 
What did you do that night, after you found out that Nicole had been attacked? 
The truth, now. All of it. 
l don't think you have a right to ask me that. 
 You don't think l have the right? 
 No, l don't. 
See, this thing happened. 
Somebody had to deal with it. 
But you were in Chicago givin' a speech, or New York... 
We'll deal with my shortcomings as a father later. 
Now l wanna know what you did after you found out your sister had been raped. 
 And l told you. l'm not gonna answer. 
 You will answer me! 
l apologise about Bauer. 
But l'd really appreciate it if we could handle this internally. 
l got no problem with that. 
Sergeant, excuse me, but if our federal colleagues are through with Penticoff,  l'd like to process him into the system. 
 Why are you here? l thought you left. 
l'm not leaving till Penticoff is behind bars without bail. 
The computer says you left five minutes ago. 
(Mason) All right, guys, we're on the move. 
Damn it! 
l got this notice in the mail this afternoon. 
Actually, it was yesterday afternoon. 
Kimberly was failing algebra. 
lt was the second notice. She intercepted 
the first one and threw it away. 
When she got home, l was so mad at her. 
l guess l accused her, and l... 
l said things to her l shouldn't have said. 
There isn't a parent in the world who hasn't been there. 
Last night, when l told her good night, she wouldn't even acknowledge me. 
l actually had the thought that l'd be... 
l'd be so glad when she got out of the house. 
When Janet wakes up, she'll know where Kim is and then we'll find her. 
 l just hope it'll be that easy. 
 lt will. 
But why wasn't she with Janet? 
lt doesn't make any sense. 
 Maybe she got freaked out by the accident. 
 We should've waited. 
 We should've waited. 
 No, no, no. 
We were right to come here. 
All we had to go on was the ambulance. 
We had to follow up on it. 
Listen, whatever happens, l'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim. 
You have my promise. 
Thank you. 
Come on, Davis, we need that uplink. 
He says we oughta have a picture by now. 
W-7 satellite was in the southwest sector when Bauer helped Penticoff escape, so, with luck, we'll be able to pull up some visuals that'll help us pinpoint his location. 
 That's it. 
 Here we go. All right. 
Davis, the link's up. 
Now l gotta get a back trace. 
This is the roof of the building from 200 miles up. 
About how long would you say since they got out? 
l don't know. Seven or eight minutes? 
OK. Davis? l wanna go back ten minutes, 
and give me stills at 30-second intervals. 
Look for two men exiting the building together. 
(Davis) As often minutes ago... 
 30... 
 There they are. 
 OK, you can speed it up. 
 All right. Speeding up. 
 Slow it down now. 
 You got it. 
You got a mark on that car? 
 Coming to you now. 
 All right. 
Where are you headed, Jack? 
 (Jack) All set? 
 All set. 
 How much time do you need? 
 A few seconds. 
 Who are these guys? 
 l told you. l don't know. 
They tell me what to do. 
l do it, they pay me. That's it. 
 (phone rings)  lt's ringing. 
 Yeah? 
 l'm not showing anything. 
 (phone rings)  Yeah? 
 lt's a cellphone. 
 We're screwed. l don't know the frequency. 
 l'll get back to you. 
 Jack? 
 Yeah? 
 lt's Gaines. There's a change ofplan. 
Nothing you can't handle. Taped to the back 
ofthe phone is a set ofkeys with a remote. 
 Got 'em. 
 lt's for a parked car on Avenue 26. 
Nevada plates, 782NOF. 
Find it with the remote. 
There's a body in the trunk. Get rid ofit. 
 What does he mean, body? 
 l don't know. 
 Whose body is in the trunk? 
 l don't know! 
Walk in front of me. 
Come on. 
(alarm beeps) Kneel up against that wall and interlock your fingers behind your head. Now. 
Don't move. 
Oh, my God. 
(tyres screech)  Hey, Jack. 
 Hey, we had a deal. 
Shut up. 
 Put him in the car. 
 Hey! Hey! 
Bauer! 
That's pretty quick work, George. 
Trackin' me on a satellite? 
 l'm takin' you in, Jack. 
 He had evidence on the Palmer hit. 
That's why l broke him out. 
 So who was this? 
 l don't know yet. 
You're havin' quite a night here, aren't you, Jack? 
Why don't you tell me what the hell is going on here? 
Unless you want me to throw you back to the cops? They're ready for you. 
There are people within the agency that are supporting the Palmer hit. 
That's why Walsh and Baylor were killed. 
They found out. 
The truth is, l thought you were a part of it. 
l apologise if l was wrong. 
George, as crazy as this sounds, you're gonna have to trust me. 
This is gonna look very bad for us if something happens to Palmer tonight. 
 So what's next? 
 l need to take the body down to CTU, and try and make an lD. 
l'll go grill Penticoff, get what l can outta him. 
 We never had this conversation, right? 
 Right. 
l'll be at District. OK. Call the precinct, 
tell 'em we've recovered Penticoff. 
(dials phone)  What have we got? 
 Body. Male. Badly mutilated. 
l need a positive lD now. 
Who's our best forensic? 
 Perry Tanaka. 
 Get him. l'll be there in ten minutes. 
 l'm on it. 
 OK. 
(dials phone)  Yes, Doctor. 
 Clamp, please. 
 (phone rings)  Hello? 
 Hey. lt's me. 
 Jack, did you find out anything? 
 Maybe. l'm not sure yet. 
 What have you been doing? 
 l'll be there in 20 minutes. l'll explain then. 
 All right. 
 Janet out of surgery yet? 
 No, not yet. She should be soon. 
Good. lt's really important l talk to her. 
l know it sounds cold, sweetheart, but she's our only link to Kimberly. 
Hang in there, honey. 
l love you. l'm on my way, OK? 
OK. 
(bird flies off Just be cool. 
We'd like our money now, if that's like, you know, OK. 
Well, just so we're, like, you know, clear... 
what happened to the other girl? 
Janet? lt's like l told you. We had to kill her. 
My people say someone fitting her description was taken to a hospital near to where you were. 
How do you explain that? 
Well, the thing is... 
Maybe, uh, she wasn't quite dead. 
Well, l'll tell you, Dan, you're either dead or you're not dead. 
There's no such thing as sorta dead. 
Here. Let me show you. 
No! 
You've just been promoted. 
Congratulations. 
We're losin' her. We've lost pulse. 
She's gone asystole. 
Start compressions now. 
What's going on? 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate, my wife and daughter are in danger, and people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer, and this is the longest day ofmy life. 
l can go over your head, Mr Almeida. 
And l assure you, there will be consequences. 
l apologise, Senator, but we do have protocol. 
Our director, Ryan Chapelle, is working on a clearance. 
 But if l could tell him why you're here... 
 All he needs to know is l need to see Bauer. 
And l need to do it now. 
 Can l get you anything while...? 
 No. 
Chapelle. 
l don't think l can stall him much longer. 
He wants to know why he can't see Jack. 
What did you tell him? 
Well, l told him you were workin' on it. 
 And he still didn't say why he was here? 
 No. He just wants to see Jack. 
Well, until l know more, l don't wanna put those two together. 
 l'm checking it out now. 
 All right. 
 So? You find out what Palmer's doin' here? 
 Not yet. 
 Any new intel on the backup shooters? 
 Yeah, uh, an Alexis Drazen. 
Looks like he's connected to two other shooters, but he stopped in DC for two days before landing in LAX on Saturday. 
There's other inconsistencies. 
l'm working on it. 
 Where's the report? 
 l routed it to Nina's computer. 
 Send me a copy, would ya? 
 Yeah. 
Weren't we supposed to answer some questions at Jack's office? 
 We're gonna do that at the safe house now. 
 ls my dad gonna be there? 
Not right away. 
Maybe when he's done at CTU. 
 Are we OK, Nina? 
 Everything's fine. 
A small, controlled environment is the most secure place for you. 
 Does Jack know you're taking us? 
 Of course. Myers. 
We're moving Teri and Kim to the safe house now. We should be there soon. 
Mom... 
you never told me what the doctor said. 
(Nina) No, l'm not worried about that. 
lt was a cyst that burst. 
She said it wasn't serious. 
 Then why did she...? 
 There's nothing to worry about. 
She said it would go away all by itself. 
Gaines first contacted me on my cellphone, directing me to a car parked at St Mark's Hospital. 
 The transmitter was in the car? 
 That's when he asked me to put it in my ear. 
Can we take a break? Could you find out how 
my wife and daughter are doing at the clinic? 
 Teri and Kim have already left the clinic. 
 What? 
They're fine. 
Nina's moving them to a safe house. 
You knew they were moving my wife and daughter and you didn't tell me? 
That's it. This is over. 
l don't say another word. 
l wanna speak to Chapelle. 
Now, Alberta! 
You're exhausting. 
l was surprised you called last night. 
l didn't think l'd see you again after DC. 
l'm not really that easy, you know. 
Will you have another break later in the day? 
The senator has to leave town this afternoon, and he's going to... Nevada. 
Only a few of us were told about it, and l am one of the ones who has to go with him. 
 You have to hold his hand? 
 ln so many words. 
Would it be too much to hope that you might have some free time in Nevada? 
You would wanna come? 
lf you want me. 
This is a pretty big shower. 
There's room enough for two. 
l'm on my way. 
 Alan. 
 Senator Palmer, what can l do foryou? 
l'm trying to talk to a CTU agent named Jack Bauer. 
 Where are you? 
 CTU, Los Angeles. 
They say l need clearance, but it's taking forever. 
 Not a problem. Who's in charge over there? 
 Ryan Chapelle. 
Yeah. OK, l'll take care ofthis right away. 
Thank you, Alan. l owe you. 
Senator Palmer, Ryan Chapelle. 
What seems to be the problem, Ryan? 
Why can't l get in to see Agent Bauer? 
Please forgive the wait. When an agent 
is under internal investigation, procedure is to keep him isolated until he's been fully interrogated. 
lt's... really out of my hands. 
Even if l can help you with your investigation? 
Mr Chapelle? Alan Optican from 
the Pentagon's on the line for you. 
Excuse me. 
 Chapelle. 
 This is Optican, Department ofDefense. 
Yes, sir. 
Senator Palmer is to be given carte blanche. 
Make sure he gets whatever he needs. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Understood? 
 Of course, sir. 
 Thankyou. 
Bring Jack Bauer down here right away. 
Thanks... for helping me... 
cut through the red tape. 
Mm-hm. 
l want all your cameras and recording equipment shut down. 
This is going to be a private conversation. 
l understand. l'll make sure 
the room is secure. 
Thank you. 
 Hey, Jack. 
 Hey. 
Listen, Nina called and wanted me to tell you that Teri and Kim are fine. 
 Who's guardin' the house? 
 Paulson and Breeher. 
OK, good. 
Also, Chapelle wants to see you in the conference room. 
Good. 
 Thanks a lot, Tony. 
 You got it. 
Milo, l'm sorry l had to switch the cards on you last night. l had no choice. 
We understand what you were goin' through. 
Thanks for your help. 
Senator Palmer. 
Leave us. 
 l'll be outside. 
 Thank you. 
Close the door. 
Sit. 
Yes, sir. 
l wanna know who's working with you. 
 ln which context, sir? l'm sorry, l don't... 
 Right here, right now. We're gonna end this. 
 l don't know what they told you... 
 l know why you want me dead. 
 l don't know what you're talking about. 
 Kosovo! 
 Kosovo? 
 l know you hold me responsible for the men you lost there two years ago today. 
 You know about Operation Nightfall? 
 l authorised the mission. 
l know you took out Victor Drazen and his inner circle. And lost six men in the process. 
 And you think l want revenge? 
 Yes, l do. 
With all due respect, l almost died today trying to protect you. 
And if l blame anyone for the death of my men in Kosovo, l blame myself. 
 What were you doin' at the power plant? 
 l was trying to... 
The reason l went for that agent's gun, sir, was to try and get you out of the room without giving myself away. 
The people that want you dead had kidnapped my family. 
They threatened to kill them if l didn't assist them in the assassination attempt. 
They didn't tell you any of this when you came in, did they, sir? 
No. 
lt's the truth. You can verify it with Chapelle. 
 OK, they're just arriving at the safe house. 
 (man) Copy that. Show visual. 
This way, Mrs Bauer. 
These are Agents Paulson and Breeher. 
They've worked with Jack for many years. 
 This is Jack's wife, Teri, and daughter, Kim. 
 (Kim) Hi. 
Hi, Kim. Where do you want us? 
One in and one out. 
Well, it's not exactly home, but it's relatively comfortable. 
There are motion detectors every ten yards. 
 How long do we have to stay here? 
 We'll worry about that after we debrief you. 
 Nina, where's the bathroom? 
 There's one in each bedroom, through there. 
lf you'd both like to clean up before we get started, please do. 
l was the head of the Special Defense Appropriations Committee in the Senate, which is just a euphemism for covert operations. 
Three years ago, the ClA brought to my attention atrocities committed by Victor Drazen in Kosovo. 
Massacres, torture, ethnic cleansing. 
The man was a monster, and was gaining support. 
l tried to go through the usual channels, but l couldn't get anyone to work quickly enough. 
So l contacted the one person l knew who could get the job done, have him terminated, off the books. 
 And that would be Robert Ellis. 
 That's right. 
Ellis was funded through a discretionary fund of my committee. 
His job was to implement the covert missions and see to it that no names were leaked. 
Now we're both on somebody's list. 
So this is payback for what happened that day. 
lt's the only thing that makes sense. 
But if someone could put your name and my name on a list together, that means they should be able to find Robert Ellis, too. 
You're right. 
Four sixes. 
Let's see 'em. 
l knew it! l saw it in your eyes! 
lf you could read what's in my eyes, you'd crawl under a rock and cry. 
Go again. 
(phone rings)  Ellis. 
 Bobby, it's David Palmer. 
 You gotta be kidding. 
 l'm not. l'm here with Jack Bauer. 
Get lost. 
What are you doin' with Bauer? l went to a lot 
of trouble to make sure you two never met. 
Someone close to Victor Drazen seems to have connected us. 
 Explain. 
 Someone wants me dead. 
And it appears they want Bauer, too. Today. 
The two-year anniversary of Nightfall. 
l'm the only one who knows you both were involved. 
Apparently not. And if we're 
on the list, it's likely you are, too. 
 Let me talk to Bauer. 
 l'm right here, Bob. 
 Jack. You still at CTU? 
 Yeah. 
To source this we need each other's help. 
Unfortunately, over the last 12 hours, l've had to cut a few corners. 
l'm being investigated right now. 
My hands are tied. 
Well, get them untied. 
David can help you there. 
lt has to be someone either connected to your team... 
No. No one on my team knew 
of the senator's involvement. 
Well, then it has to be Drazen's group. 
l'll retrieve the closed file on Nightfall. lt'll 
contain the names of Drazen's associates. 
That'll take a few minutes. Meantime, 
you need to pick up a trail on the money. 
Odds are it's funded through Belgium. Can 
you get to your K-3 accounts from there? 
 Yes, if l get reinstated. 
 All right, start there. 
We'll compare names when we talk again. 
Where can l reach you? 
CTU, Los Angeles office. 
All right. 
(knock at door) (Nina) Teri? 
 Yes? 
 l put some clean clothes on the bed. 
Thank you. 
They called me and said you decided not to fly out. Aren't we going to Nevada? 
Apparently not. The senator needed to do 
something. He thought we'd be safest here. 
 Are you taking a later flight? 
 l don't know. l hope so. 
Call the Times. Tell them 
l'll do that phoner, 45 minutes. 
Sure. 
(dials out)  Hello. 
 You miss me yet? 
 Of course. 
 l hope you didn't bookyour flight to Nevada. 
l was just about to. Why? 
We might not be going. 
 When will you know? 
 ln about an hour. 
lf you stay in town, will you remain at the hotel? 
l don't know. They might 
switch us for security reasons. 
Either way, l'll let you know where l am. 
l can still smellyour perfume on my skin. 
l'll call you as soon as l know. 
 ls that the girl? 
 Yes. 
Palmer might not be leaving after all. 
 Better for us. 
 Mmhm. 
Was there any problem getting rid of Gaines's people? 
No. 
You should never have used him. 
l told you it was a mistake. 
Fine. You fixed the mistake, 
now let's move on. 
(girl giggles) She looks like Martina. 
Our sister's dead, Andre. 
Leave it alone. 
 Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko? 
 They have their targets in sight. 
And as for Palmer, l give you my word he will be dead by midnight. 
 Hey. Do you have any toothpaste? 
 Yeah, it's right there. 
That's nothing. The doctor just 
wanted me to take it as a precaution. 
You scared me. 
Kim. 
What? 
You're pregnant. 
l don't understand. What happened today... 
How is that possible? 
lt was Dad, of course, but a test like this, it takes time before... 
You were trying to have a kid and didn't tell me? 
No, honey, it wasn't like that. 
Kim. Kim! 
 What? 
 Please! 
This is just as much a shock to me as it is to you. 
Dad and l use birth control. 
lt's protection, but it's never 100%. 
Whatever. You don't need my permission. 
l'm not asking for your permission, Kimberly. 
Once in a while, you have to think about what another person is going through. 
Honey, l just found out l'm pregnant. 
You don't think that terrifies me? 
Well, it does. 
Mom... 
l'm sorry. 
(Ellis) Are there any other names on the HK list thatyou recognise? 
 Rich Goen, Michael Redman. That's it. 
 No, they weren't cleared until after the op. 
 l'll use what we have so far. 
 l shouldn't be here. 
 Green's got me on priority. 
 l cleared it. 
 OK, Bob, he's here. 
 Milo. 
 Yeah. Who are you? 
 Don't worry about me. 
Ah, l see you opened some sockets up to Ml5. 
 How did you know that? 
 Doesn't matter. 
We're tryin' to hook up some names. 
l'm gonna help you. 
Now, what's your login lD and password? 
Give it to him. 
The login lD is LFN. 
Password's foothill 94022. 
Lower case. 
OK, hang on. 
OK, looks like we got some partial results. 
 Partial? 
 Yeah. Looks like there's something missing. 
What do you mean, Bob? 
Something's been removed. 
l'll look into it. 
Meanwhile, Milo, l'm gonna... 
l'm gonna send a file to your server. 
Why don't you print out hard copies for Jack and David? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Thanks, Milo. 
All right, here we go. 
Feels like l haven't eaten in years. 
Feels good, doesn't it? 
Not being afraid any more. 
Yeah. 
l'm sorry, Mom, l was being really stupid before. 
So, when are you gonna tell Dad? 
You know what? 
Right now. Come on. 
Um... 
(phone rings)  CTU. Almeida. 
 Hi, Tony, it's Teri Bauer calling. 
 Could l talk to Jack, please? 
 Hi, Teri. Actually, it's a bad time. 
 He's... he's kinda busy right now. 
 Could you tell him to call? lt's important. 
Sure. 
 l really want to hear his reaction. 
 l'm so lucky to have you. 
Aw, baby. 
Hi. Sorry, but we need to start the debrief. 
CTU's eager to find out what you know. 
 We're ready, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Great. l'd like to start with just you, Teri. 
 Fine. 
 l think l'm gonna go to my room. 
 That's a good idea. You should try and rest. 
This is standard procedure. 
We're gonna put you on videotape. 
OK. 
( ''Clocks Grow Old'' by lAm Spoonbender) (phone rings)  Yeah? 
 Hi, Rick? 
Hey. 
 Kim. 
 Are you OK? 
Yeah. l just lost a little blood. 
You need to see a doctor. 
You don't sound good. 
 l just need a few days' rest. 
 Turn yourself in. You can get medical help. 
And l'll also get arrested. 
 But you helped us escape. l'll tell them that. 
 No! 
Don't tell them anything about me. 
Well, it's too late. My mom's already being 
questioned. They're gonna ask about you. 
l'm next. l can't lie. 
OK. Don't. 
Tell them that l didn't know anything about what was goin' on and that Dan threatened me, he had a gun. 
OK, but promise me you'll turn yourself in. 
l gotta think this through. l'm not like you, 
Kim. l don't come from a good family. 
 System's not gonna give me a break. 
 lt's your only way out of this, Rick. 
l brought you to Gaines. That's kidnapping. 
They could put me in jail for the rest of my life. 
What's incredible is that none of this has anything to do with me running for president. 
lt has nothing to do with... the primary. 
lt has nothing to do with my being black. 
lt's just revenge for taking out... Victor Drazen. 
Yes, sir. 
(phone rings)  Hello. 
 David, it's Sherry. 
 Oh, hi. Are you back at the hotel? 
 Yes. Where are you? 
l'm at CTU, a government agency. 
Why? 
 There's some things l have to take care of. 
 David, what's going on? 
l'm trying to find out who's attempting to kill me, Sherry. 
 l've got to go. Wait for me at the hotel. OK? 
 OK. 
Bye. 
Just doesn't stop. 
l'm sorry this is happening to you, sir. 
You've been detained. 
Your family's been kidnapped. 
And you're concerned about me. 
That didn't have anything to do with the election. That was about my son. 
ls he OK? 
l just realised today... 
that l haven't always been there for him. 
And what's killing me... 
is that he's always been there for me. 
Being the son of a politician isn't easy. 
Being a son... or a daughter... 
or a father... 
none of it's easy. 
Your wife and daughter OK? 
l don't know. 
l hope so. 
 OK. Just try to be relaxed. 
 OK. 
l just have a few questions. 
This just came in from Ellis. 
l organised it into three sections. 
Cross-references are in the first part. Then 
there's a summary of Operation Nightfall. 
Details that may not be important are at the end. 
 Any word on the missing file? 
 No, not yet. 
OK, thanks, Milo. 
What is the Ambassador to Libya doing on this list? 
Probably kept Drazen's money separate from the government. 
We've had our eye on him for quite some time. 
Do you know a Rene Bonniere? 
 No. Who's he? 
 He's out of North Africa. 
A couple high-ups over at District thought he was trying to set up terrorist cells in the US. 
Jack. Page four. 
Second paragraph down. 
Drazen's wife and daughter were in the bunker? 
Did you know about this? 
This wasn't in our initial report. 
They died in the explosion. 
My God. 
This is an eye for an eye. 
We took out Drazen and his family. 
Now someone wants mine. 
Who's in charge of protecting your family? 
Jack! Who has the authority to add 
security to your wife and daughter? 
Chapelle. 
 (woman) Yes, Senator? 
 Send in Mr Chapelle right away. 
Yes, sir. 
There was nothing else you saw or heard that gave you a glimpse into their operation? 
No, that's it. They really didn't 
talk much in front of us. 
 Tell me about this boy Rick. He helped you? 
 Yeah. 
How? 
Well, different ways, but mainly he gave us a gun and he helped us escape. 
 How'd he get a gun? 
 l don't know. 
 And you don't know his last name? 
 No. 
 l don't think Kimberly knows either. 
 How did she meet him? 
Through her friend, Janet York. 
Everyone used to say ''Wait until she's a teenager, you'll finally understand the meaning of the word 'worry'.'' 
l'm sure she'll grow out of it. 
Jack says she's basically a level-headed kid. 
Jack talks about Kim? 
Just the usual stuff. 
lt surprises me. Jack's work always 
seems so serious and secretive. 
lt's hard to picture him sitting around the office talking about his family. 
Sometimes at lunch he'll bring up something if something's on his mind. 
So, do you think Rick had the confidence of lra Gaines, the leader of the group? 
l really couldn't tell you that. 
 Nina, could l ask you a question? 
 Sure. 
When Jack and l were separated... 
did he ever talk about me? 
Jack never discussed his marriage. 
Oh. 
Sometimes he would... talk about Kim, 
you know. 
We all knew he was going through a very hard time and that he missed you both very much. 
When Jack and l got back together again... 
he told me that he'd been with someone else. 
l told him it didn't matter what l did, what he did... when we were apart  
that was in the past. The only thing that 
mattered was what we did from that point on. 
lt was you, wasn't it? 
Teri. 
l saw it... when we got off the helicopter. 
l saw it when you looked at him. 
After you were separated, yes, we saw each other. 
But it didn't last long. He realised 
it was a mistake and he went back to you. 
 What about you? 
 What about me? 
Did you think it was a mistake? 
 Are you still sleeping with him? 
 No. 
Teri... 
it was over before he went back to you. 
That is the truth. 
Look, l realise this is a terrible time for you to discover all this. 
When do you think a good time would be, Nina? 
l'm sorry. 
lt's just we have to get through the rest of this. 
l need to take a break. 
Yeah, Mike, l know. 
We'll be leaving in about five minutes. 
l can't wait for Ellis. l've got to go. 
Senator, they're not gonna let me continue to work here. l am technically still under arrest. 
Come on. 
Ryan! 
 Yes, Senator? 
 l understand you have Jack under arrest. 
l told the senator l was being detained. 
There is an ongoing crisis that supersedes any charges that might be filed against him. 
 But Senator... 
 l want him reinstated immediately. 
Sir, you don't have the authority to make that decision. 
Alberta, please. 
Sir, what you are asking isn't possible. 
The charges against Agent Bauer are serious. 
We'd be in contempt of agency regulations if we reinstated him without a hearing. 
Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me. 
Not permanently. 
Nobody here has as much information about this situation as l do. 
Give me provisional status till the end of the day. 
Then you can take me back into custody, do whatever you want. 
Fine, Jack. 
You work the case out of CTU, but you answer to me. 
Good luck with your campaign, Senator. 
Thank you. 
Walk with me. 
Secret Service wants me to leave the state. 
They say it's not safe. 
Well, l agree with them. 
The one thing we know... is that Drazen's 
people are here, and they want us today. 
And it's almost three o'clock now. 
The day is more than half over. 
l'm going to stay. 
Let's flush them out into the open and deal with them. 
Otherwise you and l and our families will be looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives. 
l understand. l'll follow up with Ellis. 
l'll keep you posted. 
 You know how to get in touch with me. 
 Jack. 
l'm sorry that l misjudged you. 
Thank you, Senator. 
Excuse me. 
Before my mom came, nobody talked to me. 
They put me in the room, l was locked in. 
 What about Rick? 
 Rick? What about Rick? 
 Well, he was one of your kidnappers, right? 
 Not exactly. 
l thought he and Dan brought you to Gaines? 
Well, it was mostly Dan. l mean, not Rick. 
l think he was actually just as surprised as we were about what was happening. 
Really? 
Well, yeah. He was fighting 
with Dan the entire time. 
He actually helped us escape. 
Hold on. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
(phone rings) Hold on. 
 Myers. 
 Hey, it's me. 
Chapelle reinstated me to provisional status for the rest of the day, at Palmer's request. 
 That's great, Jack. 
 Yeah. How's everything going over there? 
 Not bad. 
 Look, we're sending over two more teams. 
 Why? 
 Looks like Teri and Kim were targets as well. 
Nina... this is not information 
they need to know, OK? 
 No, of course. 
 Good, thanks. 
 Let me speak to Teri, OK? 
 Sure. 
Teri? 
lt's Jack. 
 Hi, Jack. 
 Hey, sweetheart. You OK? How you doin'? 
l'm OK. 
 How's Kim? 
 She's fine. 
Tony gave me a message that you wanted to tell me something important. 
No, it's nothing important. 
Are you sure? You sound funny. 
lt's nothing, l just... 
l just... 
l'm so tired. 
Why don't you try and get some rest, sweetheart? 
Listen, if... if you need anything 
from the house, Nina will make sure  someone can go and get it for you, OK? 
 Yeah, OK. 
l've gotta go. l love you, OK? 
l'll call you as soon as l can. 
OK. Bye-bye. 
Mom! 
l'll be right back. 
 So, what did he say? 
 l didn't tell him. 
 Why not? 
 lt wasn't the right time. 
You should go back and finish with Nina, honey. 
What's wrong? 
Nothing. l just think you should 
finish answering Nina's questions. 
(phone rings) Bauer. 
 Jack, it's Bob. 
 Hey, Bob. 
Yeah, l shot over a few more things to Milo, but l still can't locate the missin' file. 
 How can l help? 
 l gave Milo enough to try it on your end. 
The more l look at this thing, the more l'm convinced the file was taken out deliberately. 
Which leads me to believe... 
it contains what we're lookin' for. 
Can you give an estimate of when you think the file was stolen? 
Also a list of people you think could've had access to even get in there? 
Not yet, but you tell Milo l got some ideas on how to... 
Urgh! 
Bob? 
Bob? 
Bob? 
Can you hear me? 
Bob? 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life. 
This is our night. 
Once you're in the White House, everything defers to the office. 
lt's what you need to do the job. 
lf it's your marriage that helps you, that's great. 
But if not, that's OK too. 
You can have whatever you want, David. 
We gotta get outta here. Which way? 
l'm in an underground detention facility. 
lt's being used as a prison to house Drazen. 
You said you took him out two years ago. 
 Take cover! 
 Let my father go, Bauer. 
The weapon's up. 
When does your suffering end? After 
you've killed all your thousands of enemies? 
Yes. 
l will offer you one consolation. 
Your family will be joining you soon. 
Your son Alexis  do you wanna see him again? 
We captured him and l know where he is. 
Get him in. 
l'm releasing you. 
 (Kim) Did my dad call? 
 No, but l talked to the people he works with. 
 Have you spoken to my mom? 
 Yeah. She's waiting for you at CTU. 
 Are you serious? 
 l'm serious. 
 (Teri) How didyou end up injail? 
 l'll tell you everything when l get there. 
(Kim screams) No! No! No! 
Help me! No! 
No! No! No! No! 
No! No! 
No! No! 
(men speak in Serbian) (man speaks in Serbian) (over PA) And now l'm proud to present the future president ofthe United States: Senator David Palmer. 
Congratulations, Senator. 
Hey, we did it. 
You know, this is our victory, and when we started out they said the country wasn't ready. 
They said it couldn't be done, that it would never happen. 
Well, here we are, still standing tall. 
And when we look back at this amazing time we can all say that we were a part of history. 
We can all say that we did our part to make this world a better place, and, God willing, our children and our children's children will reap the benefits of the seeds we sow right now. 
(phone rings)  CTU. Myers. 
 (Jack) Nina, it's me. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 l'm with Andre and Victor Drazen. 
 What do you mean? Where? 
 Nina, just listen. l'm being held hostage. 
The reason why l'm calling is Victor wants confirmation that his son Alexis is still alive. 
He's in the hospital. 
l can try to get through to his room. 
 OK, do it. 
 OK. Hold on. 
Tony, get me the hospital. 
l need Alexis Drazen on line two. 
l spoke to the backup team. 
Drazen escaped. l want a net over the area. 
l want one, three and five-mile mobile barriers. 
We know. We've got Jack on the line. 
He's with Victor Drazen. 
 What? 
 (Tony) Nina, l've got Alexis Drazen. 
Transfer it. 
 Who... who is this? 
 Hold on. 
Alexie? 
Father. 
Where... where are you? Did you get out? 
Alexie, what happened? 
What have they done to you? 
You.. you always said that... 
l would get in trouble with women. 
You were right. 
Forgive me, Father. l failedyou. 
You have not failed. You are alive. l am free. 
Free. 
Hold on, Alexie. 
We will be together soon. 
No, Papa. 
You go without me. l'm not going to make it. 
You will make it. Be strong. 
Tell me you can do this. 
Yeah, Papa. 
l have something to say to the rest of you. 
l am willing to trade the life of Jack Bauer for that of my son. 
Mr Drazen, this is George Mason again. 
l'm acting head of the CTU. l don't 
have the authority to make the trade. 
lf you do not have the authority, you are not head of anything. 
Talk to your superiors. 
We will call back in 15 minutes. 
Be ready to respond without qualification. 
And let me remind you that when l was ten points behind in the polls, l told you l had a plan that on this date we were gonna celebrate, party nomination in hand. 
Well, promise delivered. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
l'm not gonna be able to go to Dallas with David tomorrow. 
Why not? 
l committed to a National Youth Service Day event here in LA. 
 That's OK. l can reschedule that. 
 No, Patty, l don't want you to reschedule. 
David and l could use a couple of days apart. 
But l don't want him to feel alone, OK? 
Whatever you want. 
..doing the right thing is the only thing to do. 
 You talk to Chapelle? 
 Yeah. 
 No trade. 
 What? 
This whole Victor Drazen thing is a big embarrassment for them. 
lf they do a trade, it's an admission that he's alive, that the DOD's kept him here secretly, and that on top of that they let him escape. 
So they're just gonna sacrifice Jack? 
He's like all the rest of us.  
Expendable. 
ls that what you think? 
lt doesn't matter what l think. l don't think 
he walks on water the way you do, but l don't wanna see him hung out to dry either. 
Nina, l tried. 
George, without the trade, how are they gonna locate Drazen? 
l guess they won't try. They'll let him leave 
the country and pick him up in Europe later. 
lf we do the trade, we know where he is. 
Hey, you're preaching to the choir. 
That's what l just said to Chapelle. 
They don't wanna draw attention to the situation. 
End of story. 
So that's it. We just go back 
to work and let Jack die. 
What can l say? 
Nothing. 
Nina. Shouldn't Kim be here by now? 
Well, they just left the police station. 
She should be here soon. 
 l never did hear what happened with her. 
 She was arrested by mistake. Listen, Teri. 
 Kim's fine. That's not the problem. 
 What do you mean? What's going on? 
lt's confirmed. Jack's been captured. 
He's being held hostage. 
We're doing all we can to bring him back, but... 
Wait. 
 What do they want? 
 lt's hard to say. 
Well, tell me what you know. 
This guy Drazen wants to trade Jack for his son Alexis, who we have. 
Well, then, he'll be OK, right? 
No. The government won't make the trade. 
What do you mean, they won't make the trade? How are they gonna get Jack back? 
They're not.  
Jack's on his own. 
l'm sorry. 
There can be no flaws and it must be done soon. 
l don't care how much it costs or how many men you need. We're out of here by midnight. 
Call me back.  
Let me know. 
There. 
 Victor. 
 Ah, my good, good friend. 
l never thought l would see you again. 
 How is your family? 
 Eager to see you. 
 Ah, soon. ls everything prepared? 
 Yes. Please, come in. 
Victor, l would like you to meet my daughter, Mila. 
 Mila, right. 
 Hello. 
 How beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Just like your mother. 
 Yes, but she got my temper. 
Ah! No good.  
That is no good. 
We have fresh clothes for you, whenever you're ready. 
To you and your family. 
 Would you like something to eat, Jack? 
 No. 
lt makes no sense. How does letting a CTU 
agent die help keep Drazen out of the news? 
 Teri, l'm busy. Can Nina help you now? 
 No. l'm talking to you right now. 
Yeah. l'll call you right back, all right? 
You are not gonna let my husband die. 
No one is gonna let Jack die. We just can't 
go through with the trade right now. 
There's no difference. 
Without your help he has no chance. 
With an ordinary agent, l'd agree. 
Jack's got a Special Forces background. 
 l've seen him do the impossible. 
 Stop patronising me. 
You've done it all night. Just tell me what 
you are prepared to do to help my husband. 
Fine. l'll stop patronising you. 
l'll tell you exactly what l'll do. 
l'm gonna call up Division. 
l'm gonna ask them to reconsider one more time and they're gonna say no and that'll be the end of it. 
Anything else? 
Nina. l'm asking you, 
someone who cares about Jack, we cannot just stand by and watch him die. 
l know. l agree.  
l'm doing something about it. 
What do you mean?  
What are you doing? 
l think there's someone who can help Jack. 
lt's not procedure, so l can't talk about it. 
You're just gonna have to trust me. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
(dials phone) Oh, Patty. See, this is the lady you should be 
complimenting. We were talking about you. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yes. They loved the speech tonight. 
Now, among other things, Patty's the brain trust behind most of my public addresses. 
Excuse me, Senator.  
Nina Myers at CTU. 
 OK? 
 Would you excuse me? l have to take this. 
 This is David Palmer. 
 Thank you for taking my call. 
What can l do for you? 
 Jack's in trouble. He needs help. 
 What kind of trouble? 
There's no time to catch up with everything. 
Let me give you the headlines. 
Victor Drazen is alive. 
 Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, he's alive? 
 That's all we know. 
He was being held prisoner by the US government up until about an hour ago. 
OK. What happened an hour ago? 
He escaped and he's taken Jack hostage. 
He's willing to trade Jack for his son. 
 What's DOD's response? 
 They're refusing to get directly involved. 
 Who knows you contacted me? 
 No one. 
 All right. Who's talking to Drazen? 
 George Mason. 
 Tell me about him. 
 Normally he's by the book. 
 But he's very ambitious and very political. 
 OK. 
Look, l'm gonna make a few calls first. 
Where can l reach Mason? 
Here at CTU.  
He's in Jack's office. 
 All right. 
 Thank you, Senator. 
Are you sure? 
OK. 
 Tony. 
 What's up? 
Kim's car was hit. 
Two cops are down and she was taken. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
Was there any communication? 
Any witnesses? 
They're working it up now. 
All right. Let me know what you find out. 
Tony, l'm gonna need to talk to you in a few minutes. 
 Tony? 
 What? 
 You all right? 
 No. We got a problem. 
Hey. Any word on Kim? 
 Uh, l was just about to check. 
 Well, she should be here any minute, right? 
Yeah. 
Teri, l'm sorry. Do you mind 
waiting in the conference room? 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 What's going on? 
 They grabbed Kim again. 
 What? 
 lt must have been Drazen. 
 The patrol car she was riding in was hit. 
 l don't believe this. 
Are you gonna tell her? 
(phone rings)  Mason. 
 (woman) l have Senator Palmer on the line. 
Oh, yeah. Put him through. 
Hello. 
Senator, this is George Mason. 
lt's an honour to speak to you, sir. 
l want you to reverse your orders on the Bauer-for-Drazen trade. 
Uh, l'm not sure how much information you have about this, but this is agency business and, with all due respect, it doesn't fall under the Senate's purview. 
As you well know, Mr Mason, your entire agency falls under presidential purview and in nine months l will be in that office. 
l'm not sure if that's meant to tempt or threaten me. 
lt doesn't matter either way because l don't have the authority to pull the trigger on this. 
From what l'm told, that authority is something you'd like to have some day. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Act on your own prerogative. 
Go through with the trade. 
You'll be reprimanded, possibly even demoted. 
So far it sounds great. 
ln the first month of my term l'll instate you in a high-level position in Washington. 
You'll bypass five years of middle management. 
And if you don't get elected? 
That's not gonna happen. 
Think about it, George. 
 Transportation has been arranged. 
 Problems with lastminute changes? 
 lt's going to cost more. 
 How much? 
200,000. 
You should try, Jack, the borek. 
 lt is wonderful. 
 Do you need anything else? 
No. Everything is perfect. 
My father told me to take good care of you. 
The service was impeccable and my compliments to the chef. 
Thank you. lt was my mother's recipe. 
Drop the weapons! Drop the weapons! 
Put your weapons down! 
Put your weapons down or l'll cut her throat! 
Drop the weapons! 
Put them down. 
 You too, Victor. 
 Of course. 
Drop the weapon! 
You son of a bitch. 
 One more death for you to atone for, Jack. 
 You son of a bitch! 
How could you do this? 
 What happened? 
 Call CTU now. 
Tell them l want your brother Alexis here now. 
Tie his hands behind his back. 
And keep her father away from here. 
You're supposed to be watching him. 
What am l paying you for? 
 Where's Teri? 
 ln the conference room. 
(phone rings) Mason. 
Mr Mason. What have you decided? 
Mr Mason? 
We're gonna do the swap on our terms. 
Yeah, that's an interesting dream. The swap 
will take place exactly 30 minutes from now. 
The address is 2127 Grand Avenue. 
A green SUV will be waiting. 
 Place my brother inside the vehicle. 
 What about Jack? 
When my brother's in position l'll direct you to Bauer. 
You have 29 minutes. 
l got it. 2127 Grand Avenue. 
 lt's a repair garage. 
 Get ahold of Chris Porterfield at LAPD. 
Tell him we're taking over the streets in that area for two hours. 
 Where are you going? 
 The hospital, to get Alexis. 
He just got stabbed. 
They're not gonna let him out. 
They're gonna have to. 
Oh, no, don't worry. My name's 
not gonna be even close to this. 
(man) This conversation has to end between us two. 
 l agree. 
 OK, then. 
 Look, l gotta get back. 
 We're clear? 
Yeah. 
There you are. David, where have you been? 
l had to make some calls. 
Just in case you haven't noticed, everyone is here to see you. You need 
to make an impression, not phone calls. 
 l know what l have to do, Sherry. 
 Do you really? 
Don't talk down to me, Sherry. l don't like it. 
l hope the weakness you've shown today is because you missed a night's sleep and you'll be back on your game tomorrow. 
Otherwise we will be buried before this election even happens. 
Steven! No, stay. l'll be over. 
Get to work. 
Senator? The Wall Street Journal 
had a couple of questions for you. 
l put together some past quotes so you wouldn't have to bother with it. 
l... l hope that's all right. 
Sure. 
Well, don't you look gorgeous tonight? 
 You've seen this before. 
 lt's not just the dress. 
Thank you. 
Patty, l've been thinking. Since this incident 
with Keith is out in the open, it's gonna shift the focus of every interview, every press conference. 
Yeah. l've already started a Q and A of all the 
questions to expect over the next few days. 
 Have you talked to Mike about this? 
 Not yet. l need a little more time to prepare. 
 l'd like to see whatever you have so far. 
 Sure. Whenever you want. 
How about now? 
 Now? 
 Yeah. 
Everybody seems to be having a good time. There's an open bar. 
 l doubt anyone will even notice l'm gone. 
 l doubt that's true, Senator. 
ln any event, l could use some quiet time. 
Stay here. Tell me where your notes are. 
lf you don't mind, l'd rather walk you through it. lt would make more sense to you that way. 
OK. Why don't you meet me 
upstairs in, say, five minutes? 
Sure. 
(sobbing) Ah. 
My dear friend. 
lt's not what you think. 
l have lost my wife and daughter. 
You, both of your brothers and now Mila. 
This is what our enemies have done to us. 
He would have killed her, and not in a merciful way. 
How could you do this, murderer? 
You killed my daughter. 
You killed my daughter! 
You murderer! You... 
 (Andre) We have to get out of here. 
 Kim! 
(Andre) Get him in the van. 
(speak in Serbian) Get this place cleaned out. 
Nina. What's happening? 
Are they gonna help Jack? 
 Yes. They're gonna trade. 
 That's good, isn't it? 
 What do you think? Will he be safe? 
 l think so. 
Victor wants his son back, so l don't think he'll pull anything. 
Oh, thank God. 
And when's this gonna happen? 
10, 15 minutes. 
Mason's already left to pick up Alexis. 
That's so good. l can hardly wait 
for this whole thing to be over. 
l think when Jack and Kim arrive, l'll just have to collapse in a big heap. 
 Do you need anything else? 
 Um... 
Actually, there is one thing. 
l know Kim's on her way over here but l'd feel better if l could speak to her on the phone. 
ls there any way you could patch me through to the police car? 
We were so busy tracking Jack, l didn't have a chance to check on them. Um... 
 Yeah, let me see if that's possible. 
 Thank you. Nina. 
l know it's been a really long day for you too, and l guess l want you to know how much l appreciate your being up front with me about everything. 
Sure. 
l couldn't tell her. 
l just couldn't after everything she's been through. 
l understand. 
You OK? 
l just... 
l just feel like l'm not doing my job. 
Look, there's nothing wrong with the way you're doing your job, OK? 
l mean, ultimately, we're here to try to help people, right? 
l don't know anybody who does that better than you. 
Thanks. 
You're welcome. 
(Jack) You gotta let my daughter go. 
She's got nothing to do with this. 
You want me to do something for you, l'll do it, but let my daughter go. l'm not... 
After what you have done, l should kill you and your daughter right now. Don't test me. 
You're not thinking this through, Andre. 
You have a chance to get out with your brother and father alive. 
 You kill innocents, they'll never let you... 
 Enough! 
Your best tactic right now, Mr Bauer, is to be quiet and let my father rest. 
OK. 
All l care about with Ferragamo is that the public knows, in no uncertain terms, that Carl and the Latham Group acted outside our influence. 
No, they will. Mike's already started setting 
up interviews with all the major papers. 
He's clearing up points with your attorney. 
By the morning you should be able to speak freely and get the word out. 
 When did you have time to do all this? 
 ln the last couple of hours. 
You wrote two speeches for me today. 
lf l don't help you get into the White House, l'm out of a job. 
 Would you care for a glass of champagne? 
 Sure. 
 When do you find time for a life? 
 Well, this is my life. 
Oh, no, no, no. l mean a boyfriend.  
Friends. 
Ah. l know. 
 l should get out more. 
Yeah, you should. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
You're welcome. 
Cheers. 
Mm. What are we drinking to? 
To taking five minutes off, starting now. 
 Mm, well. Hear, hear. 
 Hear, hear. 
So, um, you and Sherry were childhood sweethearts? 
That's right. 
And there's never been anyone else? 
l'm running for president, Patty. 
l can't answer that. 
Come on. 
Are you flirting with me, Patty? 
l don't know. 
 l think l might be. 
This is good. Tell Mike l wanna meet 
with him on this first thing in the morning. 
l want you there. Call Everly. 
Someone from legal should be there too. 
 Done. 
 And... 
it wouldn't hurt to put in a little more face time downstairs. 
l think you might be right. 
 Shall we? 
 Yes. 
(Jack grunts) Wait here, Father. 
(Jack groans) lf your people deliver my brother as promised, you'll live. 
lf not, then you'll die here. 
There are sniper rifles currently aiming at you. 
 They await my instructions. 
 What about my daughter? 
You'll hear from us when this is over  if you make it that far  and to dissuade you from wasting valuable time trying to trace, l prepared a scrambled phone. 
What do you want me to do? 
Not yet. 
What do you want me to do?! 
 Oh, Senator. 
 Hey, John. Thanks for coming. 
Hey, Michael. Thanks for coming. 
Look at you. Don't you look nice? 
 Sir. 
 Hey, how are you? 
Senator. 
There you are. l'd like for you to meet 
Doctors Bryan Chasin and Darrell Maines from UCLA. 
Yes, of course. You're the gentlemen doing 
such wonderful work in AlDS research. 
Sweetheart, l need to look after something. 
 Uhhuh. 
 Excuse me. 
So, what isn't the government doing for you that we could fix next term? 
Patty? 
 Hi. 
 You were upstairs with David, weren't you? 
Yes. 
Good. What happened? 
 l did what you told me. 
 And? 
l think it's working. Mrs Palmer, 
l'm not sure where all of this is going. 
All you need to know is that this is for his own good and for the good of his campaign. 
What's the problem? l thought you liked 
David. This shouldn't be a tough assignment. 
l do like him. 
lt's just hard for me to deceive him like this. 
l understand your hesitation. 
But l know my husband better than anybody and he needs someone like you right now. 
But it's gonna lead to other things, Mrs Palmer. 
Well, we'll just deal with that when the time comes. 
Oh, cherries. Mm. 
Thanks. 
Everyone in position. 
OK, we're here. Stay outside the perimeter. 
Let's just get in and get out. 
 Here's Alexis. Where's Jack? 
 What's wrong with him? 
 Nothing. He'll be fine. 
 Alexis, are you all right? 
(phone rings)  Yes. 
 Alexis is hurt. 
 How badly? 
 Worse than we thought. 
He's fine. 
 We need a doctor. 
 l'll have one there when you arrive. Go. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Once we're satisfied you're not following us,  we'll give you Jack's location. 
 That's unacceptable. We need to know now. 
Hold it right there. 
Move to second position.  
We have a problem. 
Are you going to shoot me? 
You should have taken more English lessons. 
''Trade'' means we get something too. 
l want Jack now or you're all coming back with us. 
We have Jack's daughter. 
You must know that by now. 
What are you saying? 
We get Jack and Kimberly? 
My English is clear. You're going 
to get back Jack, as discussed. 
 What about the daughter? 
 That's not my concern. 
l need to talk to Drazen. 
lf you keep holding me here, l can't return Alexis to his father. 
We are on a schedule, remember? 
All right. Move back to the perimeter. 
We're gonna have to let 'em go. 
We'll be waiting to hear from you. 
 (Mason) Nina, do you copy? 
 Yeah, l have 'em. 
Soon as we get Jack we'll take them down. 
OK. We're standing by. 
(beeping) Dammit. 
 What's wrong? 
 They found the tracker. We lost 'em. 
(phone rings)  Yeah. 
 (Andre) South of the platform there's a car. 
lf you want to see Kim alive, talk to no one, get into it, head towards Century City. 
Wait, wait. 
 You have to believe me. 
 The things I see are real. 
 I can't. 
This is what you've been feeling your whole life. 
You lived by the grace of God. 
Jesse Parker. The lifeguard. 
We have to eliminate Jesse Parker before he ruins everything. 
I'm not sure he really can be killed. 
 But we have to try. 
 Go wash the car. 
Christina's worried about your safety. 
She's absolutely right to be. 
This was the right move, baby. 
You only have one master, and Boyd's not it. 
I hope for your sake you can die, because if you can't... 
this is gonna be a hell of a way to spend eternity. 
 Where's Jesse? 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Did you see how evil she got because of me? 
Once you calm down, you will see everything I did was to help you. 
Lucas, don't leave me in here.! 
Jesse, you asked Father Matthew if you're chosen. You are. 
Where have you been? 
Meg. I didn't see you there. 
Did you find Jesse? 
What? Did Judy tell you? 
No, Judy doesn't tell me anything. 
She doesn't want to upset me. 
I figured it out for myself. 
No, I didn't find Jesse. 
I hope you weren't up all night worrying. 
I'm up all night anyway. 
I don't really sleep anymore. 
Why not? 
I've let Judy pretend that I don't know anything... 
but I think that has to change. 
What are you talking about? 
I still hear the voices, and sometimes they're hard to understand, but they're there. 
The meds aren't keeping them out. 
 Meg, I'm so sorry. 
 No, don't be. 
At least I know now that I wasn't delusional. 
Though sometimes I wish I were. 
I know who you are... 
and I see the horrible things you're going to do to this place. 
 Meg. 
 But that's only one future, Christina. 
I think there are choices for all of us. 
What about Jesse? 
He's in danger- terrible danger. 
 From Boyd. 
 Boyd... 
other strangers... 
and you. 
Is there still time to stop it? 
I don't know. 
 Holly, eat. 
 Why? I can't die. 
No, but you can starve. 
You can't stand to see me suffer, can you, sweetheart? 
You already know the answer to that. 
 You let me the hell out of here. 
 I can't do that. 
I'll behave. 
I'll do anything. 
 Let me help you with her. 
 We're beyond that now, Holly. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You didn't get Wes killed. 
I did. It was my fault. 
I killed Father Tomas to teach Christina a lesson. 
I started a chain, and it's too late to stop it now. 
What's going on, Lucas? 
They're here. 
Christina's not ready yet. 
Hey, Nancy, it looks like we're gonna need a tow at Grand and 14th. 
 What's the problem with your car? 
 It's not my car. 
 Well, where's the driver? 
 I don't know. I found it like this 20 minutes ago. 
Judy.! Sit down and have 
some breakfast. 
Oh, thanks. 
Um, I'm going out. 
Have you seen Christina? 
I know she told you the truth about what she is... 
and I understand why you kept it from me. 
You were afraid that I couldn't handle it. 
But the only person in this house who can't handle the truth is your father. 
I've been telling him about the voices for years... 
and even with everything that's happened... 
he still won't see. 
So, those meds he's had you on They never work for long. 
No, what's happening must be too powerful. 
There are people here who can help Christina fight... 
and I'm going to find them, no matter what it takes. 
Mom, what's happening to us? 
I don't know, sweetie. 
But I do know that if we stick together... 
we'll find a way. 
Damn it. 
Nick. 
What the hell's going on? 
You're with us now. 
You're safe. 
 Who are you? 
 Graham. 
We'll be working very closely together. 
Someone attacked me. 
He was trying to bury me. 
You killed him. 
That was one of Boyd's men Wesley Feist. 
 Why does Boyd want me dead? 
 Because you're the only one who can kill her. 
You went to Father Matthew with some questions. 
You knew you were special. 
Everything we could tell you, you already know. 
Christina. 
No. I don't know anything. 
 Fermo! 
 Get out of my way. 
I'll put you through that wall. 
I'm serious. 
Try. 
You were built for a fight, but not with me. 
It's with Christina the Antichrist. 
A week ago, I could've stood by and watched you behave like an idiot. Those days are over. 
You're going around town looking for Jesse... 
not only exposing yourself, but leaving a trail. 
 Leave me alone. 
 Don't try and pretend like you don't know. 
You've seen it in your dreams. 
Jesse was sent to this Earth to destroy you. 
He would never do it. He couldn't! 
Why? Because a teenage crush 
is more powerful than destiny? 
How do you know we can't change the way things are supposed to go? 
Jesse and I are different when we're together- stronger. 
If he's on your side, why is he already with them? 
 Who? 
 A team of believers, high level the ones that killed Wes... 
the ones that came here to teach Jesse how to kill you. 
Whoever they are, he won't listen to them. 
It's too late. 
They've already started to turn him. 
Trust me. 
I have seen their work. 
I know what you think about me, and I know what you think about your father... 
but if you want to live... 
we're the only ones you can trust now. 
Stay with me. 
Let me protect you. 
You can't take them on by yourself. 
You can barely take me. 
They're ready to move us. 
 I'm a prisoner. 
 You're the world's only hope. 
We can't let anybody hurt you. 
Look, everything I've told you... 
everything you've seen I know it must be hard to believe. 
The intricate plan to kill my girlfriend, the daughter of the devil? Yeah. 
Just think, Jesse. 
Remember... 
the seven hours you were dead... 
Christina- how to kill her... 
and what would happen if you didn't God showed it all to you. 
 I didn't see any of that. 
 You chose not to see it! 
 That's different. 
 We're here to help you. 
We're almost done with the preparations. 
We'll be ready for the body soon. 
The body? 
If you don't do this, Point Pleasant will burn your family, everyone. 
And that's merciful compared to what'll happen in the rest of the world. 
 Andiamo. 
 Come on. 
So where are you taking me? 
I can't tell you that. Sorry. 
So am I. 
Come on, Jesse. 
Oh! 
 I missed you last night. 
 Yeah? 
 How much? 
 A lot. 
Terry! 
 I thought you were at work. 
 Hey, Mrs. Hargrove. 
 What is he doing here? 
 Terry has a name, Mom. 
You better learn it. 
He's gonna be around. 
 Do you know who he works for? 
 Mr. Boyd. 
So what? 
You worked for him too. 
Yeah, that's right. 
I know what I'm talking about. 
Look, it's nothing personal. 
I'm sure you're a good kid... 
but I won't allow Paula to see you, as long as you work for that man. 
Come on. 
Paula-This is for you, Paula. 
Look. 
I'm just trying to protect you. 
Okay. Wait a second. 
Slow down here. 
Boyd says that they're here to kill you? 
Why would they want to do that? 
Oh. That. 
Maybe Boyd's lying. 
Why should you believe anything he says? 
This time I know it's true. 
Somehow I've always known. 
Why are you Why are you packing? 
You know you can't leave Point Pleasant. 
You've tried. 
I don't know what they're gonna be aiming at me... 
but I don't want your family to get caught in the middle. 
You do kind of know what they're aiming at you, right? 
It's Jesse. 
Mom told me. 
She's seeing more and more. 
It's- It's like Boyd said. 
She's tapped in. 
Did she know they already have Jesse? 
No. 
By now, they've- they've probably told him everything who my father is, what I am. 
Chris, what are you gonna do? 
I'm gonna try and find Jesse, and I'm gonna talk to him. 
Maybe I can stop this from happening. 
You're just gonna go at this alone? 
I mean, there has to be something I can do to help. 
There is. 
Take care of your mom. 
There is. 
Take care of your mom. 
Mrs. Kramer. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I came to see your dad. 
 You know he's  He's sick. 
I understand. I just thought 
he might like a visitor. 
Okay. Yeah. 
I, uh- I gotta go to work, but... 
go ahead in. 
Thanks. 
Meg. 
I hope you don't mind my just showing up like this. 
 David, are you  I had a dream about you this morning... 
which is pretty weird because... 
I haven't thought about you since high school. 
We never had much in common, did we? 
We do now. 
How so? 
The thing about invalids is... 
no one really notices us, do they? 
That's why we make the perfect soldiers. 
What are you doing? 
You were meant for more than this, David. 
But you can't do a damn thing from bed, hooked up to these meds. 
I'll die without that. 
Maybe. 
Maybe not. 
Thanks. 
Jesse! 
Where you been, dude? 
I don't have any time. Does your dad still have 
that hunting cabin by Allaire Park? 
Yeah, but no one's been out there in years. 
Place is probably rotted. 
I need to borrow it for a few days. 
And I need a car. 
 What's the matter? 
 I can't talk about it. 
I just need to know, can you help me? 
 Terry! 
 Yeah. No problem. Take my dad's car. 
The keys are in the visor. 
And listen, I know this is gonna sound weird, but don't say anything to anyone not Paula, not any of the guys and not Mr. Boyd. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Terry, stay away from Boyd, okay? 
He's dangerous. 
He's my boss. 
That's not gonna be so easy. 
Just trust me. 
Be careful. 
And thanks for this, man. 
I owe you big-time. 
 Hey, Atkins. 
 Hey. 
 So what do we know? 
 Well, not much. 
This is Etta Challis. 
Etta, tell the chief what you told me. 
I was trying to buy this stuffed thingy... 
for my sister's baby shower, but no one was at the register. 
Did you see who was working the counter before they left? 
Was it an older guy thinning hair? 
Yeah. He was there when I first came in. 
Then he was gone. 
Irwin flips the sign when he takes a break... 
 which is practically never. 
 Can I just leave my money on the counter? 
You're a cop. Is that illegal? 
I mean, I'm really late for work. 
All right. Go ahead. 
 Did you check the back? 
 Yeah. Restrooms too. 
 Looks like the guy just kind of  Disappeared. 
What the hell, Chris? 
Drive! We need to get somewhere safe 
we can talk. 
 You believe them, don't you? 
 No. 
Get out of the car. 
 Jesse? 
 I said, get out. 
Christina, stop! 
I said, drive. 
If you're trying to convince me that you're not evil, this isn't helping. 
 I need you to listen. 
 How can I believe you? 
You're the devil's kid, right? 
Is that what they told you? 
 They said a lot of things. 
 Whatever they said, nothing is written in stone. 
I'm made of more than my father. 
How could you have not told me, after all those questions? And could you slow down a little? 
What should I have said? "You have amazing eyes, 
and by the way, my dad is Satan"? 
If you knew the whole story, I was afraid you'd be in danger. 
 You got that right. 
 Whatever happened to all your talk of your calling, Jess that we're made for something... 
 together? 
 We are death. 
I'm supposed to kill you, Christina. 
And if I don't think of some way out of this, that means the perfect puzzle you and me adds up to one of two things the end of everything or your blood on my hands. 
That's why I was running. 
We have to believe we can change it. 
My mother was human a good human. 
Do you really know that? 
You've never even met her. 
Father Tomas He was sure of it. 
He felt there was good in me. 
Jesse, you said it. 
We're stronger together. 
You're the one person in the world who makes me feel I can beat this. 
Maybe you are supposed to save us... 
just not in the way that everyone thinks. 
Judy, can I talk to you a second? 
Sure. 
Sweetie, Mom's getting worse. 
She needs some help. 
Actually, I think she's doing a lot better. 
I know how tough this must be on you. 
She's your mom... 
and it must be really hard to let yourself believe that something's really wrong. 
Maybe you should listen to her for a change, instead of just shutting her down. 
Judy, what she's saying Mom is not crazy, okay? 
Is Christina here, or Jesse? 
Wow. Give me a second. 
I've never heard anything so heartfelt. 
Apology for deserting me accepted. 
 Are they here? 
 No. 
 Look, I have a job to do. 
 Am I part of your job? 
The truth is, I was wondering how I could convince you to leave town. 
Excuse me? With you? 
No. With your family. 
 Who are you? 
 No one. 
Just a job, waiting to be finished. 
I liked meeting you. 
I'm grateful for it. 
I know it hurts, David. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't do this. 
 It's not too late to go back. Just say the word. 
 Meg. 
Lock the door behind you. 
If Terry comes home and-and sees this... 
he'll try and stop it. 
Are you sure? 
Go! 
Okay. We'll be in touch. 
Who's that? 
Mrs. Brewster, the wife of your ghost 
from the gift shop. 
 She file a missing person's? 
 Yeah. 
What? 
I don't know. 
This morning, that abandoned vehicle? 
It belonged to a 78-year-old male who uses a walker to get around. 
That's not exactly the type to run off. 
 You check the hospitals? 
 Yeah. No record. 
I'm just saying, it's strange. 
I mean, two M.P.'s in one day? 
 Maybe it's a coincidence. 
 Chief? 
 Yeah. 
 I got a worried call from Principal Middleton. 
Said his daughter never made it home last night. 
Mr. Boyd. 
Hey, I- I was just getting ready to head into Most employers would fire someone for showing up with alcohol on their breath. 
Yeah, I know. 
I shouldn't have. 
But not me. 
I'm the kind of employer that cares about the well-being of my people. 
I see my guy drinking in the middle of the day, I want to know... 
is everything okay? 
Everything's good. 
How about your friend Jesse? 
Is everything okay with him? 
He's... fine. 
Where is he, Terry? 
Well, why do you want to know? 
Do you work for me or not, Mr. Burke? 
Jesse's my best friend. 
I'm not gonna let something bad happen to him. 
Terry... 
things have been going pretty well for you... 
since you started working for me, haven't they? 
For example, you-you finally got the girl of your dreams the lovely Paula Hargrove. 
Now, I can have a profound effect on people. 
I'm sure you've noticed that. 
It doesn't matter what Paula thinks she feels now. 
I could take her away from you... 
in the blink of an eye. 
Or you could just... 
tell me where Jesse is. 
It's so very simple. 
I'll unlock the chain, and you pull it through, okay? 
We can't just stay here. 
We need a plan. 
Let's just get to the cabin first. 
Then we'll figure out our next move. 
Christina! Oh, God! 
 Jesse! 
 Let us have him. 
Nobody gets hurt. 
Nobody else, you mean. 
I'm warning you. 
If you touch her, you'll be sorry. 
We didn't want to involve her. 
This is between us. 
Take him. 
We won't hurt her, but you need to come with us. 
I don't think so. 
That's enough, kids. 
I've got men all around here. 
 Boyd. 
 Poor, dead Wes. 
He was a sadist and a mediocre assistant at best... 
but he was right about one thing. 
Jesse here was gonna kill our little girl... 
unless we... kill him first. 
No! Jesse! 
Christina, please. Leave him behind. 
Come with me. 
 Are you insane? 
 It's simple now. 
They want you dead. 
I want you alive. 
Damn it, Chris. 
Don't you get it? 
He's gonna kill you. 
Leave us alone! 
All of you! 
Christina, come on. 
Let's go. 
Welcome to the Point. 
You won't live through this either... 
 demon. 
 We'll see. 
Terry, what's going on with you? 
You're acting weird. 
I just... wanted you to meet my dad. 
I mean, this is serious between you and me, right? 
Of course. 
And I totally want to meet him... 
but all of a sudden, you're in this rush or something. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm not in a rush. 
We have all the time we want. 
I just... wanted you 
to see where I lived... 
see my dad... 
 get the whole picture, you know? 
 Okay. 
I'm here. 
I am not going anywhere. 
 Remember, my dad's not  I know. 
I can handle it. 
Dad? 
 Do you have a key? 
 Door's never locked. 
Dad, you okay? 
Terry, be careful! 
Where would he go? 
I don't know. 
He hasn't been able to walk in years. 
I have to pull it out. 
Don't. It's too dangerous. 
We need to take you to the hospital. 
No. 
Oh, my God. 
It's only like that when you're with me. 
But we should still go to the hospital... 
 and make sure you're okay. 
 No. They'll find you. 
So they find me. 
Maybe they should. 
Don't say that. 
A few hours ago, you weren't sure if I should die. 
It It's okay. I 
I don't blame you. 
Chris... 
those guys back there You could've killed them. 
 I did break 'em a little. 
 Because you had to, to save me. 
You could've done a lot worse. 
I believe you that you can win this... 
no matter what anybody says. 
I hope you're right. 
Meg said there were other people who are on our side- people who would help us. 
I just- I don't know who they are or where to find them. 
We wait till morning. Then we get into town, 
find Meg and see if she can help us. 
We just have to make it through the night. 
Why did you bring me up here if you're just going to ignore me? 
Lucas. 
 What are you so upset about? 
 I told you. 
I let Jesse slip away. Christina's in danger. 
That never would've happened before. 
Hmm, before I got here? 
Well, isn't that sweet? You've gone all soft 
and ineffectual because of little old me. 
It's not a joke. 
This battlewhat's coming if it all goes wrong You have no idea. 
If Jesse got away, that means he's with Christina, right? 
 Of course. 
 Well, that's good for you. 
They are intensely in love... 
and they're desperate. 
All they really have in the world is each other. 
I remember being in love like that. 
And look how that ended. 
It's bound to go wrong, Lucas... 
and that's when Christina will need you. 
You'll get your girl back. 
We should keep it dark in here so people can't see in. 
 How's your chest feel? 
 Chris, it's fine. I promise. 
Hey, you need some sleep. 
 You don't seem scared. 
 I told you. 
We can win this. 
What if we don't? 
Even if we don't... 
I'm with you. 
You said you wanted to wait. 
For what? 
I'm with you now. 
Christina. 
Jesse! 
You are the devil. 
Jesse.! 
Jesse, talk to me, please. 
Jesse, what happened? 
What did you see? 
 I know what you're gonna do. 
 Jesse! 
Wait! Jesse! 
Please don't leave me. 
Please. 
Christina. 
Your wife was the last person who saw him, and now he's gone. 
Your wife was the last person who saw him, and now he's gone. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 I don't know. Meg said 
she didn't know anything about it. 
I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but everyone knows Mrs. Kramer's not right. 
We all heard about her meltdown at the church. 
I'm sure she didn't hurt your father. 
Meg couldn't hurt anyone. 
He couldn't get out of bed. 
Explain to me how else it could've happened. 
I can't, Terry. 
Don't you think I wish I could? 
Then we'll let the cops explain. 
Okay. Well, thank you. 
If you think of anyone else who might know where she is, give us a call. Okay. 
Statement from a friend of our missing Mr. Brewster. 
He doesn't know where the guy is now, but lately he's been Says he saw him going to confession three times? 
This week alone. Guy's obviously 
feeling guilty about something. 
 Maybe he had a good reason just to up and take off. 
 Wait a minute. 
Middleton said that he and his daughter were fighting? 
Hang on. 
All right, here. "Candace said the only person 
she could really talk to lately was her priest." 
Her priest was at St. Martin's 
same as Brewster. 
And Wayne Leone's car this morning Was found two blocks from there. 
Sarah, it's me. Listen, I want to talk to you 
about some folks at St. Martin's. 
Give me a call as soon as you get this, okay? 
Meg. 
Ben, something's happening to Christina. 
 It's gonna be okay, sweetie. 
 How do you know? 
I haven't taken good enough care of you, honey. 
Things have gotten worse again. 
But that's going to change now. 
Dr. Evett, what are you doing here? 
 What is he doing here? 
 I'm just here to help, Meg. 
Ben, what are you doing? 
 We're gonna take you to the hospital  No! 
where they can take better care of you than I can. 
 Please just come with us. 
 No. No. No! Please, God, no! 
No! No, it's too important right now. 
 Please! You can't take me. I'm her only hope. 
 Stop! 
 Meg, just calm down. 
 No, please understand! 
 Dad, what's going on? 
 Judy, help me! 
Meg, just calm down. 
 Judy! Judy, just 
 Let go! Just let go of her! 
This is for her own good and for yours. 
You don't know what's good for her. 
You don't know what's good for anyone. 
Enough! 
You're scaring your daughter. 
No. 
God knows what you did to Terry's father. 
David Burke was ready to make his change. 
I just gave him permission. 
No, honey. 
That's why he left home 'cause he-he wanted to go through it alone. 
 Let's go. 
 No! Judy, don't let them keep me there. 
 Please, Judy  No, I won't. 
 Mom, I won't let them  Christina needs me! 
 Judy! Judy! 
 Stop. Stop! 
It's okay. 
Sarah? 
Honey, you home? 
Sarah? 
Promise me you won't kill Jesse. 
You know he's gonna try and kill you. 
Promise me. 
What do I do? 
You come inside. 
She's the child of darkness. 
She's under his protection now. 
I won't let you destroy these people. 
I was sent to be an influence. 
I can't just crawl inside that head of yours and make you do things. 
Her powers are starting to manifest. 
She'll never be what you want her to be. 
She's also the daughter of a woman. 
That means she has a choice. 
Let the world have its way with her. 
Once it does I guarantee you she will bring it to its knees. 
 How long was I dead? 
 Seven hours. 
 How the hell can that be? 
We're still feeling guilty because we fell for each other while you were with someone. 
No, no, not someone! 
We stepped out on your sister! 
The fatal flaw- every marriage has one. 
Just a matter of time till it presents itself. 
I can't do this anymore. 
I won't wreck that woman. 
She's getting worse. He thinks she's 
having some kind of bad reaction to the medicine. 
 Boyd did this. 
 Christina has decided to let someone else in... 
on Point Pleasant's dirty little secret-Judy Kramer. 
Only you can save your family, Judy. 
All you have to do is listen to me. 
Judy's with me now. 
She knows the truth. 
 I can't exactly move my legs. 
 Yeah, well, there's sodium pentothal in there too. 
So that's what this is a fact-finding mission. 
What did you do to her? 
She's tapped in, and it's gonna burst her pretty skull. 
That's why I had to shut her down. 
 Now what do we do? 
 I'll tell you what. 
Tell me she's the one you want. 
 You only get one. 
 Yes.! 
 Say it.! 
 She's the one I want.! 
Freeze.! 
Shall I gut her, boss? Huh? 
 Shall I wear her? 
 Judy. 
Judy? Judy.! 
Judy.! 
Maybe you should stay home. 
No. No, I have to go. 
This is our fault. Father Tomas 
This wasn't your fault. 
Father Tomas is dead, and I'm alive because you chose me. 
 He knew this was a war. 
 He didn't want to die. 
Judy. 
You are not going to die. 
I won't let you. 
Terry.! 
Terry.! 
 Arrived, found this young man  Terry! 
Terry.! Terry.! 
Let me get that for you. 
I forgot the Yanks were on the West Coast today. 
 Big day here in Los Angeles. 
 There. 
Just in time for the first pitch. 
It's good to have another kid around. 
Seems like Terry's never here anymore. 
 He's been working. 
 Doing what, exactly? 
Uh, Mr. Burke, I think you should 
probably ask him that. 
You're right. 
It doesn't really matter, does it? 
We all got our jobs to do. 
Figured out what yours is yet? 
Well, I know it's not playing baseball. 
You're starting to understand. 
 Understand what? 
 You weren't put here to play games. 
This ball has a chance.! 
Dude, we're gonna be late. 
 He'll round into home ...all possibilities. 
'Cause the devil was almost dragging him home. 
Father Matthew, I'm so sorry. 
Such a terrible accident. 
 And Father David gone too. 
 Not gone. Missing. 
I pray every day that he'll return to us. 
It's a trial, Sarah. 
Faith means nothing until it's tested. 
I just want to tell you I'm sorry. 
Father Tomas was good to you, I know. 
Thank you, Jesse. 
Oh! I miss you. 
Come home. Look, I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean to scare you. 
I need you to understand why I didn't tell you. 
I do. I do, Mom, but, look... 
the stuff you believe about me let's say it's true... 
that I have some sort of higher purpose. 
You have to let me find it myself. 
Of course. 
This is where I found him. 
God, I'm sorry. 
I can't imagine what you're feeling right now. 
Try rage. 
Hey. Hey, you okay? 
Father Tomas had no family. 
He was taken in as a ward of the church in Oaxaca, Mexico... 
and when he was of age, he chose to take vows. 
He came to Point Pleasant full of hope and purpose. 
He felt the Lord wanted him to I'm sorry. 
He was a fine young man. 
And while I try to trust in God's divine plan... 
I can't hide the... 
anger anger that he was unable to fulfill the destiny he was given. 
Anger at the forces of adversity which seek, cruelly, our undoing. 
I rage at God... 
who created hope just so he could kill it... 
over and over to the end of time. 
At him, I am angry. 
Amen! 
Christina. Christina. Look at me. 
Chris. 
Let him see my rage. 
Stop. 
Stop. You can't do this. 
This is a story of betrayal! 
What kind of God... 
lets evil walk among us like this? 
Christina, please. 
Let my fury tear his house apart! 
But we must... 
find the way of the lamb and not the lion. 
The doubts we harbor that dark night I just described... 
that is what we must guard against. 
Let us pray. 
Christina. 
 Wait. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just been a tough couple of days. 
 Chris, that's not it. 
This is gonna sound crazy. 
Something's happening in Point Pleasant. 
Powerful eulogy. 
The priest was on fire. 
A little too much brimstone for me. 
So, your friend We've never been formally introduced. 
 Jesse. 
 Parker. 
 You're the lifeguard. 
 Who is this guy? 
He works for my father. 
Jess, can you give us a minute? 
It's okay, really. 
I- I'll come find you. 
How dare you come here? 
Please, that was my kind of party... 
till the lifeguard calmed you down. 
It was just getting amusing. 
 What? I don't get to meet the boys you're seeing? 
 You stay away from him. 
You're not in a position to give me orders. 
You tried that once and lost. 
Remember? 
I'm gonna stop you, I swear to God. 
How? You can't control me any more 
than you can control yourself. 
You're losing it, Christina. 
 That was weird, huh? 
 Yeah, you could say that. 
I mean, I haven't been in there since Isabelle's Oh. Right. Me either. 
The last time I wore this dress. 
That's way too much death for something I bought in the juniors' department. 
What are you doing later? 
I was thinking you could take me out. 
Spring for some classy grub, like a place with lots of forks. 
Our first date in public, huh? 
Okay. But honestly, 
I'm more of a dollar-menu girl. 
 You are the perfect woman. 
 I know. 
So, Boyd's in town to watch you? 
Yeah, I think so. 
But he's doing more than that, isn't he? 
 Chris  Jesse, please just stay away from him, okay? 
 Please. 
 Chris, can I talk to you? 
Hey, Chris. Wait. 
What happened in there I- I'm sorry. 
That was you, right? 
Making Father Matthew your rage puppet. 
I think so, yeah. 
Hey, Mark said a bunch of people are gonna haul a keg up to the meadow tonight. 
I'm gonna tell him I'm in. 
You can't be serious. A party? 
It's more like a wake. 
I just think everyone's sensing the weird. 
Judy, Boyd is circling, and I'm not exactly at my best. 
I need to pretend everything's normal for one night, or I'm gonna lose it, seriously. 
No, I get it. 
 But I'm going with you. 
 Damn right you are. 
Oh, Dr. Kramer. 
I didn't expect you to be back so soon. 
I forgot some paperwork. 
I was just about to order some office supplies. 
How many boxes should I get? 
 For  For the move. 
 What move? 
 Amber Hargrove came by the other day. 
She said she needed to get into your office. 
Something about an appraisal. 
Amber Hargrove was in my office? 
Well, okay. Thank you. 
You've been getting your hands dirty pulling weeds. 
 Well, it builds character. 
 Yeah. 
Wax on, wax off. I get it. 
Look, no disrespect, Mr. Boyd, 
but I can do more here. 
That so? 
What is it you think I do exactly, Terry? 
Speak freely. 
I don't know. 
Between construction jobs, my dad did... 
other kind of work. 
No-Nothing too heavy, but... he knew some people. 
You think I'm a criminal? 
And you still want to work for me. 
No. I want to learn from you. 
Well, there's one project you can help me out with. It involves Christina Nickson. 
 You know her, right? 
 Yeah, a little. 
 Her father and I are in business together. 
 Seriously? 
Had her pegged for a Fortune 500 girl. 
What makes you think she's not? 
He'd like to know who she's spending time with- boys, that kind of thing. 
And I'd like you to be my eyes and ears on this. 
Sure. Yeah. 
I, uh, think she's going to some party tonight. 
Good. Then so are you. 
Right. 
There are people that could profit from hurting a girl like her. 
We need to make sure she's not running with the wrong crowd. 
No problem. I'm on it. 
Sir. We found her. 
Atlantic City. 
South side. 
Mr. Boyd's got me working tonight. 
You seriously can't get out of it? 
 Nah. It's important. 
 Whatever. 
I wasn't sure I wanted people seeing me out with you anyway. 
Look, if I finish early, maybe I could come by later. 
If you're lucky, maybe I'll still be here. 
So, I know you didn't really want to be here tonight. 
 So, thanks. 
 You're welcome. 
And, uh, in the spirit of full disclosure... 
I think you should admit I'm not the only reason you're here. 
Look, I- I came tonight to look out for you both... 
not play. 
Boyd has made it clear that he's got his eye on Jesse now too. 
What? 
Why didn't you say anything? 
I just found out. 
I'm trying to figure out, okay? 
 Don't worry. 
 "Don't worry"? 
The last guy Boyd had his eye on ended up in a box. 
 You can't protect everyone all of the time! 
 I can try. 
Yeah, and you can fail. It's happened. 
You have got to tell him he's in danger. 
 How do I do that without telling him exactly what's going on? 
 Maybe you should. 
Okay, he'll think you're crazy at first... 
but take it from me, it's better to know because knowing might be enough to keep us alive. 
Or it might be the thing that gets him killed. 
You've got to cut him loose. 
Chris. Christina! 
A friend told me... 
I should pray. 
I should stay open to you. 
So tell me why! 
What did I do? 
Do I need to die? 
Is that what has to happen? 
I should, God. 
I don't think I'm strong enough. 
I wish I was. 
 Hey. 
 Nice shriek. 
I was going for more of a cry-for-help thing. 
Nice. 
Fell on seriously deaf ears, I'd say. 
You pickin' up sort of a end-of-the-world signal from this crowd? 
Funeral fallout. 
But very astute for a summer kid. 
 It's winter in my heart. 
 Another fine response. 
Rock]  I'm I'm Judy. 
 Nick. 
Hey, I gotta talk to my friend, so Say no more. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I was starting to think you ditched me. 
 I go where you go, remember? 
 New friend? 
 Uh, he's, like, a little too cool. 
I was getting banter anxiety. 
Look. 
Now's a perfect time to tell a guy he's in mortal danger. 
You know what I think? 
I think you're not afraid he won't believe you. 
You're afraid he will... 
and when he finds out who you are, he'll run. 
What's up, Chris? 
You avoiding me? 
That's not it. 
I just I need to be alone, okay? 
 Whatever's wrong, I wanna help. 
 You can't. 
 Look, you justyou need to back off, okay, Jess? 
 Why? What's going 
I mean it! 
Just stay away from me. 
Hello, Amber. 
You know, you really should lock your doors. 
I'll catch up with you guys later. 
What's going on with Chris? All of a sudden 
she's telling me to keep my distance. 
She's having a hard time, with Father Tomas and everything. 
Maybe you should just leave her alone. 
You and I followed her that day, and then you kicked her out. What's changed since then? 
I was just wrong about her. 
That's all. 
And that guy who came up to her outside the funeral today- Boyd. 
Who is he? 
Look, he works for her dad. 
Jesse, just stay out of it. Trust me. 
 Her dad is a bad guy. 
 She told me. Organized crime. 
I'm not buying it, Jude. 
That's not what I felt off that Boyd guy. 
There's- I felt something bigger. 
 What do you mean? 
 There's more. Something 
between Chris and that guy. 
That's why she doesn't want me around. 
Jesse, just don't get involved, please. 
I am involved, Jude. 
I'm gonna find out what the hell's going on. 
He's crazy about you. 
You know that, right? 
Then what's the problem? 
I have daddy issues. 
Yeah. I feel you. 
My dad, before he got sick... 
he did a little time. 
Jesse, his folks, they they kept me from sliding, you know? 
When When things get like that... 
it's- it's good to keep decent people around. 
You get in less trouble. 
Yeah. 
I don't think "less trouble" is in my vocabulary. 
Thanks for the beer. 
I gotta say... 
I almost bought it. 
The new leaf, your friendship with Meg. 
The bout of chastity. 
I should have seen it coming. 
 What is it you want, Amber? 
 Nothing. 
Is it still me, or have you moved on to a bigger prize? 
 No, I just  Then what were you doing in my office the other day? 
 I forgot to  You find anything interesting? 
Where is it? 
Please. Please. Stop it. 
 Where is it? 
 It's over there. It's over there. 
I'm so sorry. 
You, uh-You watched it. 
 Have you seen Judy Kramer? 
Pretty good, uh Pretty good party, huh? 
Come on, Nick. 
Yes, you do. 
 Come on. 
 So are you gonna sleep with him? 
Because I don't think you should sleep with him. 
Nice. 
Folk Rock] I've been watching his face. 
I don't like what it does between conversations. 
What? 
 What do you care? 
 I get to care. 
No, Mark... my buddy... 
not anymore you don't. 
Hello. Partiers? 
Hello! 
 What  She will destroy you. 
Who? Let go of me! 
 Father David. 
 I didn't mean to scare you. 
Then you should have written me a letter from wherever you were. 
She put the life in me. 
You have to help me. 
 I I can't. 
 You can't? 
 Hey, hold up. 
 Hey! Help! 
 Judy. 
 We need to, uhWe need to What? Are you okay? 
 ThThThe father. 
 Father Tomas. 
No. David. Father David. 
He's walking. He's talking. 
But he's, like, 99.9% less alive 
than he used to be. 
Father David. I saw him on your boat. 
He was burning. 
Yeah, but he's found the mortality loophole, and he's coming for you. 
 What? 
 I don't know. He said he was fueled by you. 
Or something. Whatever. 
He wants to kill you bad. 
Okay, uh, you need to get out of here. 
 You need to find Jesse, and you both need to go. 
 We're not the ones it wants. 
 That doesn't mean he won't hurt you to get to me. 
 Yeah, but I I said, get out of here! 
Rock] Hands off, man. 
I found her. She's mine. 
Hey. Have you seen Christina? 
Yeah, with Judy a few minutes ago. 
 Everything all right? 
 Later, man. 
 Jesse? Jesse.! 
 Something's wrong. 
I know. There's this girl. She's out on the 
main road. She's passed out or something. 
 What about Chris? 
 She doesn't know C.P.R., Jesse, but you do. 
Come on. It's this way. Please. 
Look, do what you want to me, but spare Meg. 
Seeing what's on this tape is more than she can handle. 
Ben, if I had any intention of using it, don't you think I'd have done it already? 
You have to believe me. 
How long have you had it? 
This one came about a week ago. 
What do you mean, "this one"? 
I destroy it, and it comes back... 
ever since Isabelle died. 
You make it sound like it's the same tape. 
After a while, I-I made a mark on the side of it just to see. 
Okay, so someone's messing with you. 
You have any idea who it might be or what they might want? 
There's no note, no request for money. 
It's like the only thing they want is the pain. 
And... 
you've been holding on to all of this for two years? 
Alone. 
God, I It's been, um  II'm sorry. I 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
We're gonna figure this out. 
How many times have you saved me... 
over the years? 
It's my turn. 
Let me help you. 
Knock yourself out. 
You asked me if you had to die. 
I'm your answer. 
At the water, I brought you back. 
I asked you to kill me. 
It's... time. 
No. Stop. Stop! 
I'm ready. 
I want you to do it. 
Jesse, no! 
Jesse, run. Run! 
Jesse.! 
No! Jesse! 
Jesse! Jesse! 
Oh, my God. 
Let go of me! My friends are in there! 
 I know. I'm not letting you go. 
 No! Nick, wait! 
Jesse. No! 
 Jesse. 
 Don't freak out. 
Did I... 
kill that guy? 
He tried to kill me, and you stopped him. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
It's okay. 
We're okay. 
We gotta find Judy. 
Do we have company? 
 I heard someone upstairs. 
 Yes, we have a guest. 
 How long will she be staying? 
 I'm not sure. 
You never are. 
Excuse me. 
Hello, Lucas. 
You haven't changed. 
The digs have though. 
How are you feeling? 
 How do you want me to feel? 
 Better. 
 That's all. 
 Oh. 
Thank you for the scarf. 
It's a nice touch. 
But I'm really not sure that it's me. 
Holly, please. 
What's the matter? 
Bad memories? 
Would you want her back, or would you want to get away with it? 
Any other sap would quit rescuing me. 
I had to get you out of there. 
What were you doing in that place? 
Trying to feel... something. 
Anything... 
besides this. 
I gotta say whatever deal you made sure worked out a hell of a lot better for you than me. 
I'm sorry. 
Say it again. 
I'm sorry. 
So am I. 
Good night, young lovers. 
I'm beat. 
I think I figured it out what's happening. 
 Jesse  No, let me finish. 
That guy Boyd- I don't know. 
This is gonna sound crazy, but... 
I sense something this power that he has. 
 He's not here to protect you, is he? 
 Listen, Jess I felt it. 
He wants to see you hurt. 
He wants to see all of us hurt. 
Chris, you shine. 
There is such a light in you. 
I can see why this guy's after you. 
People like him, they hate things that are so right. 
That's not all. 
I think you're only seeing what you want to see. 
No, no. That's how it was. 
I've been waiting to know what my purpose is. 
I mean, I dragged you from the ocean. 
We survived that bus crash. 
We kept that woman from almost dying. 
Wait, wait. What are you saying? 
You think you were put on Earth to save me? 
No, just We're stronger together. 
I mean, really stronger. 
I think we were put here to save each other... 
and maybe do something great together. 
I don't know about any of this. 
That's okay. 
I do. 
 Chris, I  We'll talk later, okay? 
Hello? 
Is, uh- Is someone there? 
Paula? 
Ben? 
Hi, Daddy. 
Mom. 
Jude. 
I'm making you this tape... 
because... I'm going to die today. 
Please know that this is what I want. 
I've seen what's coming... for all of us. 
I know what's going to happen, and... 
I can't be here. 
I'm not strong enough. 
I won't feel any pain... 
so I hope that brings you some comfort. 
Please don't be mad at me. 
I love you. 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer. 
This is the longest day ofmy life. 
 Take the next exit. 
 Placerita Canyon Road? 
 Yeah. 
 How much further is this place? 
l told you l'd take you to your family and l will. That was the deal. 
The deal is you'd better hope my wife and daughter are still alive. That's the deal. 
(Alberta) l'm sure my being here has been a big adjustment. 
l appreciate the hard work and long hours you're all putting in. 
There's a high probability that Palmer is still in danger, but we are making progress on several fronts. 
(woman) Senator, if we could just get one statement from you, sir... 
Yes, sir, please. 
Our most promising lead continues to be Jack Bauer. 
Local and federal law enforcement have made finding him a priority. 
We're trying to locate the man who posed as a photographer at the senator's appearance. 
This man may have been involved with Bauer. 
l've told the agencies we're working with they can expect full cooperation... from all of us. 
Hopefully, we can repair some of the damage caused by Bauer's recent actions. 
Thank you. That's all. 
(dials phone) (phone rings)  Bauer. 
 (Nina) Jack. 
You were right. Kevin Carroll showed up 
with the information we need. 
l'm on my way to where Teri and Kim are being held. 
 Where? 
 Somewhere in the north valley. 
East of the 5 between Tampa and Reseda. 
l'm coming up to some orange groves now. 
Activate the GPS function on the PalmPilot you sent me. 
l need satellite photos so l can see what l'm going into. 
Make them high res so l can identify structures and personnel. 
OK. l'll need a few minutes 
to download off the satellite. 
 lt won't be a fresh image. 
 Fine. Get me what you can. l'll wait. 
 Jack? 
 What? 
Green. She's still squeezing 
everyone here to bring you in. 
l will turn myself in as soon as l know my family is safe. 
 She thinks l've been in contact with you. 
 Deny it. l'll back you up. 
 l know you've put yourself on the line... 
 No one's twisting my arm. l gotta go. 
Excuse me. 
 Was that Jack? 
 Yeah. 
 Where is he? 
 The north valley, closing in on Teri and Kim. 
 You gonna tell Green about this? 
 Not until he gets them out. 
What if he can't? 
l'm gonna have to live with my mistake. 
Tony, l appreciate you looking the other way on this, but don't feel you've gotta help me cover for Jack any more. 
l'm not doing this for Jack. 
Kimberly. He tried to kill us. 
l didn't have a choice. 
Taking a person's life, believe me, l... l feel sick. 
That's just it, Mom. l don't feel bad at all. l... 
l don't feel anything except happy he's dead. 
(bleeping) They're looking for him. 
OK. We have to get outta here 
before they find him. Cover up the blood. 
(guard) Yeah, that's right, man. 
No time for this. 
There's two of them. 
When they're gone, we'll move. 
(phone rings)  Nina. 
 l have the photos. They're a few hours old. 
Hold on. 
 OK. l'm ready to receive. 
 Are you there yet? 
l'm just outside the perimeter. 
l see a dozen people on the ground. 
Some look like they're carrying weapons. 
 That looks right. 
 There could be more inside the buildings. 
We should bring Green into this. Come 
clean with her so she can authorise backup. 
l don't want backup. 
Not until l know my family is safe. 
You cannot go into an armed camp by yourself. lf... 
Nina. My family's being 
held hostage because of me. 
lf you bring CTU in, they could screw up and make this another Waco. 
Send me the photo. Now. 
 l'm sending. 
 Thank you. 
l'll get back to you. 
Get outta the car. 
What are you doing, Jack? 
Dammit, Jack. 
Will you get a hold of yourself? 
We had an agreement. 
l bring you here, you let me go. 
The agreement was as soon as my family is safe, l will let you go. 
Jack, don't be stupid. Even if you get in there, 
you'll never find them without me. 
Come on! 
Jack, please. 
All right. All right. 
You drive. 
Jack, if Gaines thinks for a moment that l brought you here, he'll have no problem killing us both. 
Then we should avoid Gaines. 
Get in the car. 
OK. OK. Just relax. 
(sirens) Real or not, the threat on your life will probably give you a bounce in the polls. 
 What's wrong, David? 
 l'm tired. 
There's something else. 
You've been off your game since you spoke to Carl. 
Carl's gonna stop the Kingsley story coming out... by cutting off her source. 
 Keith's therapist? 
 Yeah. 
 Did Carl say how he planned to do this? 
 No. He just said l'd better stay out of it. 
Maybe that's good advice. 
Well, you don't seriously think Carl would do something to hurt this guy? 
You know Carl better than l do. You tell me. 
l think you're being paranoid, but if you're really concerned l'll call this therapist, tell him to be careful. 
l already tried. l got his voice mail both times. 
You called him? Exposing yourself like that? 
For God's sakes, David, you're running for president. 
What were you thinking?! 
Anything goes wrong, everyone around the car dies, starting with you. 
 Gaines has been waiting for you. 
 l know. 
 What happened to you? 
 l had a fight with your wife. 
Are you gonna open up the gate or do l have to do it myself? 
Roll up the window and go. 
(Jack) Stop here. 
 How many men on site? 
 15, 20. 
 Which is it? 15 or 20? 
 l didn't do the hiring. 
My wife and daughter are in one of these buildings. Which one? 
 l don't know. 
 Take a guess. 
This whole rescue act... 
You really think it's gonna make up for how you screwed up your marriage, Jack? 
Teri's told me everything. 
How you were never around, the separation... l mean... 
You're wasting your time. 
Teri's been very lonely. 
For the last time, which building are they in? 
lt's this one. 
lt used to be used for cold storage. 
Dammit. 
 Yeah. 
 You understand my concern. 
 Yeah. 
 You do realise what's at stake, don'tyou? 
You know we're working against the clock? 
Don't worry, Mr Drazen. 
Yeah, we'll be outta here within the hour. 
 lf there's a problem, you'll be first to know. 
 l want an update soon. 
Yeah. 
Hey, Rick. 
 Where's Eli? 
 l haven't seen him. 
l sent him to take care of the women a while ago. See what's taking so long. 
You want me to load this up first? 
Yeah. 
Dammit. 
(siren) (phone rings)  Hello. 
 This is Dr Ferragamo. 
Thankyou for returning my call. 
 Your message said it was urgent. 
 Yes. l wanted to talk to you about my son. 
 l can't do that. Doctorpatient privilege. 
 lt didn't stop you from talking to the press. 
 lf you're calling to threaten me... 
 l am not the one who's threatening you. 
Really? 
Whatever you leaked to Kingsley, certain people wanna stop you from confirming it. 
l assume you're referring to yourself? 
No! l'm trying to protect you. 
You've covered up one murder, and now you're threatening me if l don't keep quiet? 
 You're twisting my words. 
 l think l'm hearing you clearly. 
(dials phone) You've reached the office ofDr Ferragamo. 
Please leave your name at the tone. 
Dr Ferragamo, pick up the phone, please. 
l need you to hear me out. 
Dr Ferragamo. 
Doesn't sound like it went very well. 
l need to see him. Talk to him face to face. 
 Later. 
 Now. 
You're supposed to be delivering your policy statement on public health care in one hour. 
 l'll be late. 
 What are you going to do? 
Pull up to his office with your motorcade? 
l'll ride with Secret Service. 
You're getting in way over your head. 
Pull over. 
(siren) They're gone. Let's go. 
Are you ready? 
 Kimberly... 
 Mom, don't say anything. l know. 
l love you too. 
Sh. Teri, it's me. lt's Jack. Sh. 
lt's me, baby. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Where's Kim? 
 She's here. 
 Kim? Sweetheart, come here. 
 Daddy! Oh! 
 (Jack) lt's gonna be OK. 
 l knew you'd come. 
lt's all right, baby. lt's all right. 
 Can we leave now? 
 Baby, we're gonna get outta here soon. 
OK? Just one minute. 
Making any progress? 
 We're working on the threat assessment. 
 l think you both know where Jack is. 
You're interfering with a criminal investigation, harbouring a fugitive... 
Jack is not a threat to Palmer. 
How do you know if you haven't talked to him? And why is he still missing? 
 Polygraph us if you think we're lying. 
 So you can stall some more? 
Save us all a lot of time and trouble and just tell me where he is. 
Tony, go to holding room two. 
l'll be there soon. 
 Nina, go to one. 
 What are you doin'? 
 l'm suspending you both. 
 What? 
 Until one of you tells me where Jack is. 
 You don't have the authority to do that. 
The first one to tell me will have a career and a future here. 
The other one will be prosecuted and discharged. 
Rick! l thought l told you to go check on Eli. 
Yes, sir! 
 Who is he? 
 They sent him to kill us. 
 When? 
 About a halfhour ago. 
That means someone's gonna come looking for him. 
 Hey, sweetheart, come here. Come on. 
 l'm fine. l'm fine. 
 (knocking)  (Rick) Kim, it's me! 
 lt's OK. He gave us the gun. 
 Get away from the door. 
 Dad! 
 Go back to your mother. 
(Rick) Kim? Kim? 
Dad, stop it. No! 
Jack. Jack! You're killing him. 
(Kim) He wants to get outta here just as much as we do. 
lt's true. Jack! Please! 
Why are you helping them? 
Cos l got Kim into this. But l didn't know 
how heavy it was gonna get. 
Get away from him. 
Get up. 
 ls anyone else coming? 
 Not that l know of. 
Good. Go sit with your partner. 
l'm glad you're OK. 
We both know why Nina's covering for Jack. 
But l think the only reason you're covering for him is to cover for Nina. 
From where l'm sitting, Tony, it looks like she's using you. 
 You don't know what you're talking about. 
 l want to help you see the situation clearly. 
Somehow, Jack Bauer is connected to the threat against Palmer. 
By not telling me where he is, you're endangering the life of a senator who stands a damn good chance of becoming the next president. 
What's Jack doing, Tony? 
Why did he show up at the Palmer breakfast  and grab the gun of a Secret Service agent? 
 He claims he was creating a diversion. 
Yeah, l know what Jack said. 
l wanna know what you think. 
 Look... if l knew where Jack was... 
 You do know. 
 You're wrong. 
 No, l'm not. 
Help me here, Tony, or getting fired's gonna be the least of your problems. 
l will make sure you're prosecuted. 
You will go to prison. 
l'll give you ten minutes. 
Take the time to decide if it's really worth ruining your life over this. 
The car is on the north end of the compound. 
l just need to go get it and l'm gonna pick you both up right there. OK? 
 You're not leaving us. 
 Sweetheart, l'm not. l'll be right back. 
Every bad thing that has happened has been because we weren't together. 
We're not separating again, Jack. 
Maybe you don't have to. 
There's another way out. A better way, l think. 
 How? 
 Gaines still thinks l'm on his side. 
So l can get one of the vans without them noticing. 
Even if they stop me, your car'll still be there. And you can all be together. 
He's right, Jack. 
 You trust him? 
 l do. 
Rick, it's Gaines. 
Rick, what's going on down there? 
 Answer it. 
 Mr Gaines. 
 Where's Eli? 
 He's outside digging a hole to bury the girls. 
Get him, dammit. 
l need him back here right now. 
When Eli doesn't come back, Gaines is comin' down here. Let me get the van. 
You've got five minutes. 
Stack those on the side, you know. 
They don't have to be upright. 
 Can l bring it out on the other side? 
 lf it'll fit. 
We ain't got no time for lunch. 
We gotta take care of this right now. 
(Gaines) Then handle it. 
There's been a change of plan. 
No, l need to know now. Not later - now. 
What's so hard to understand about that? 
Come on, guys. Let's go. 
 Will you guys hurry with the truck there? 
 l'll take it, Mr Gaines. 
Hey, Joe, where's Eli? 
(Gaines) Get him, OK? 
 What are you doing? 
 Taking the van. 
l can see that, Rick. 
Where are you taking the van? 
To help Eli get the bodies from the guesthouse. 
You can't move a couple of women by yourselves? 
He told me to get the van, so l'm getting the van. But if it's a problem, l don't have to. 
(guard) Mr Gaines. 
 What? 
 l was out on patrol and l found Kevin. 
What? ls he alive? 
Yeah, but he's out cold. 
Someone messed him up pretty good. 
 Where are you? 
 l'm in the north grove, near the generator. 
l'll be right there. 
You're driving. Let's go. 
Open the damn door. 
At the very least be careful what you say to Ferragamo. 
 l'll be careful. 
 l mean, it's not like he's so squeaky clean. 
By talking about Keith to the press he violated every professional ethic. 
l know what he did, Mike. 
(siren) Pull over here. 
Here's the office. 
No, no, no. Let me find out 
what happened. l'll be right back. 
What happened? What caused this? 
A possible gas explosion. 
 lt's Ferragamo, isn't it? 
 There was a fire. 
They say it might have been a broken gas line. 
 He didn't get out in time. 
 Dammit! 
They torched his office. 
And you can bet his records were destroyed. 
We don't know anything yet. 
 lt could have been an accident, David. 
 But it wasn't. lt was murder. 
 David, stop. No, wait, wait. Listen. 
 Get out of my way. 
Hear me out here. Just hear me out here. 
Look, David, think this through. 
Even if you're right, this is the absolute wrong way to play it. 
Dammit! 
Go. 
Time's up, Tony. 
Have you thought about what l said? 
 l have. 
 And? 
 Excuse me. You have a call. 
 l said no interruptions. 
lt's Bauer. 
Where the hell are you? 
You might have my office, but if you wanna do my job, listen to me. 
 l don't take orders from you. 
 l found the people behind the Palmer hit. 
You're one of 'em unless you can prove otherwise. 
They had kidnapped my family - my wife and daughter. But l'm with them now. 
lt's why l worked underground and couldn't contact CTU. 
 You haven't spoken to anyone here? 
 l couldn't risk it. Believe me, l wish l could. 
lt's not my job to believe you, Jack. 
lt's my job to find you. 
l'm at an orange grove three miles north of the split on the 5. Hold on. 
34 degrees, 17 minutes north, 118 degrees 28 minutes west. You got that? 
 Yeah. 
 l've identified 11 hostiles. 
They're going west on the compound service road. Bring in air support. 
l'll get back in touch. 
Get Central Dispatch. And find out where 
Jack's family has been for the last six hours. 
Dammit. 
 Are you ready to go home? 
 Definitely. 
 We get to finish our chess game. 
 l'm two moves from checkmating you. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see. 
Hey. We're gonna be all right. 
l promise. 
 Let me know as soon as you see him. 
 Yeah. OK. 
Teri, it's gonna be OK. 
Between us. You and me. 
l love you. And l promise you everything's 
gonna be different from now on. 
No, l want two choppers. lf Villa has 
a problem with that, he can call me. 
Jack called with his location. 
l sent three field units to back him up. 
 ls he all right? 
 We'll find out soon enough. 
 So which one of us are you gonna suspend? 
 Neither of you. 
Only because l don't have enough actionable evidence that you withheld information. 
But l plan to keep looking. 
l wanna know who's running point in the field units so we can monitor what's happening. 
 Are you OK? 
 Alberta worked me pretty hard in there. 
Yeah, l know. 
l gotta tell you, if Jake hadn't have called when he did... 
You took a lot of chances for me. 
l won't forget it. 
Kevin. Kevin! 
Kevin, what the hell happened? 
 Bauer. He's here. 
 What? 
l went to meet Cofell, but Bauer had already gotten to him. 
 How long have you been here? 
 l don't know. 
Rick! 
Bauer's here. 
Those near the guesthouse, go in strong. 
Seal the gates. Make sure no one gets out. 
Stay in the door. 
lt's him. He brought the van. Come on. 
 (Teri) ln you go. Go on. 
 Gaines is coming. 
 He found the guy you came in with. 
 l'll drive. 
Hold on! 
Get down! Get down! 
Hold on! 
Stay down! 
 (Gaines) Get up to the van. 
 (Jack) Everybody out and stay low! 
Get to the back of the van. 
Use the wheels for cover. 
Take cover. 
 Cover me. l'm going across. 
 Move! Move! 
On the satellite photos you'll see an old water tower by the service road. 
Go straight through these woods, follow the creek bed and run. l'll see CTU finds you. 
 What about you, Jack? 
 l'll be right behind you. 
 There's too many of them. 
 Not if l help. 
 You know how to use that thing? 
 Yeah. 
Teri, stay there! 
(Kevin) Wait for a clear shot! 
 l'm not leaving you, Jack. 
 You won't be. You'll be taking care of Kim. 
 But Dad... 
 Don't argue with me. Both of you, go now. 
Go! Run! 
Keep covering me! 
Go to the tree line. 
Go. Go. 
Stay down. 
Hit the deck! 
Come on. Get up. 
Move! 
Let's go. 
Keep moving. 
l can stop it bleeding when we're through the trees. 
Come on. l'm not leaving you behind. 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter are in danger. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer, and this is the longest day ofmy life. 
 (Jack) You OK? 
 (Kim) Yeah. 
Are you all right? 
 Who's in this chopper? 
 Just Jack and his family. 
The prisoners are in other transport. 
(man) Sir, this way. 
All together. 
 (Teri groans)  Are you hurt? 
No. My stomach's been 
bothering me for a couple of hours. 
Sweetheart, did something happen there? 
No. lt's probably just 
from all the stress, honey. 
There's an ambulance waiting to take you to a clinic where a doctor will examine you. 
 Can't we stay with you? 
 No. l've gotta stay here at CTU. 
 Jack? 
 Alberta. My wife Teri and my daughter Kim. 
 Hi. 
 Thanks, Nina. 
 The ambulance will take them to the clinic. 
 (Jack) Good. 
You'll be going with Agent Scott. 
He'll take care of you. 
 Jack, what's gonna happen with you? 
 lt's all right, they just have to debrief me. 
Hey, come here. 
Don't worry, OK? l'll call you as soon as l can. 
We're doing more than debriefing you. 
l have to place you under house arrest. 
You'll be held here and questioned until we hand you over to the FBl. 
Nina, l want you to watch over Teri and Kim. Make sure they're OK. 
 Green's got me doing mopup. 
 Get Tony to do it. Just get over to the clinic. 
 l'll have to get Green's approval. 
 Nina, please! 
 Could you ask if l could have some water? 
 Right away, sir. 
Alberta. Tony's finishing 
the procedures on the mop-up. 
l've been here since before midnight. 
l'd like an hour off to go home, clean up. 
Denied. 
Come on, Alberta. Please. 
l've been through hell today. 
l have a great eye for BS. lf you want 
an hour off, tell me where you're going. 
Jack asked me to look after Teri and Kim. 
They feel isolated since he can't be there. 
Now, there's an irony for you: you looking after Jack's wife. 
Make sure Tony's got everything he needs before you leave. 
Elizabeth, have we heard from Christopher yet? 
Yes. But he only had early projections. Those 
were from New York and Massachusetts. 
Get with me when he has the other states. 
l wanna know if the incident at the breakfast is hurting us. 
Of course. 
What's on your mind, Sherry? 
You've got to go out there today with your best face on. 
There can be no talk about Keith and no talk about Ferragamo. 
Ferragamo's death was an accident. 
l'm not gonna talk about Ferragamo. 
l'm dropping it. 
Really? 
l'm being blackmailed. 
 By who? 
 By some of the people who finance me. 
 What do they want? 
 They're determined l get to the White House. 
And if l don't do what they want, they say they can build a murder case against Keith. 
For Lyle Gibson? 
No. For Dr Ferragamo. 
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Keith was 
nowhere near Ferragamo's office today. 
According to Carl, who's been doing all their dirty work, someone planted evidence that could implicate Keith in Ferragamo's death. 
Oh, no, David. No. 
Oh, no. 
 This happens when you cover things up. 
 Don't preach to me, David, OK? 
 What are we going to do? 
 l don't know yet. 
 Does Keith know anything...? 
 No. 
And he's not going to. 
You must be Teri. l'm Dr Kent. We're gonna 
be taking very good care of you today. 
 This is your daughter Kim? 
 Hi. 
We know about your abdominal pain. 
l'd like to get an ultrasound. 
No. lt's actually not 
as painful as it was before. 
That's good. But we wanna 
make sure we know what it is. 
ls there any other discomfort? Anything 
you wanna tell us before we examine you? 
No. 
Mom? 
Mrs Bauer? 
l was raped. 
l see. OK. 
Then we're going to need to draw blood and do some tests. 
And l would like to recommend you to a psychiatrist. 
That's not necessary. 
Mrs Bauer, of course you can do what you want, but under the circumstances, l think it's important for you to take a few minutes and speak to someone. 
Well, l'd like to keep this confidential. 
The records are private. 
Only the doctors have access. 
No, l mean from my husband. 
All right, if that's what you wanna do. 
(Dr Kent) The nurse'll be in shortly. 
l think we should spend some time with Senators Blalock and Gleeson pretty soon. 
l don't feel comfortable aligning myself with them. 
You're going to need their states. 
Just being seen with them will go a long way. 
(Palmer groans) OK. 
Was there something else? 
l'm worried this Ferragamo thing is not going to go away. 
Let me handle the Ferragamo situation, Mike. 
You just make sure the rest of the day gets back on track. 
Did l hear you say something about Dr Ferragamo? 
 There was a fire in his office. 
 l'll get on this other stuff. 
 Thanks, Mike. 
 Dad? 
Keith, l'm sorry. 
Dr Ferragamo died. 
 When? 
 About an hour ago. 
We just found out. 
Wait. l don't get it. What kind of fire? 
We're still waiting to hear the details. 
What's goin' on? 
Are you saying that my psychiatrist, Dr Ferragamo, was involved in this? 
That he told Maureen Kingsley something l said to him during a session? 
ls that how this whole story about Lyle Gibson started? 
lt seems that way. 
But he died in a fire an hour ago? 
lt was an accident. 
 No. l don't believe this. 
 Keith, look. 
 We have to let it go right now. 
 Let it go? 
 You mean cover it up. 
 There's nothing to cover up. 
Sure there is! 
Somebody didn't want him to talk because it'll hurt your campaign. 
What would you like me to do? 
 Go to the police? 
 l can't. 
l don't get it. What was all that stuff 
you said before about trusting the system? 
l trust the system. 
When my hind part's on the line. 
But when it's your campaign? 
My campaign's been on the line ever since you lied to me about Lyle Gibson. 
l don't understand. You've been on me 
all night to keep quiet about Gibson's death. 
This isn't about Lyle Gibson any more, is it? 
l might have been involved in Gibson's death, but somebody murdered Dr Ferragamo, and they have to pay! 
Keith. 
He meant something to me. 
That's right. 
Look, l was in real pain, and Dr Ferragamo was the only one there for me. 
So we're not gonna pretend like this thing never happened, OK? 
 Keith... 
 No! You don't know how messed up l was. 
l wouldn't have made it without him. 
Just give me a little time. 
Let me get to the bottom of what happened. 
lf there was foul play, l promise you, we'll come forward. 
 Why can't we come forward now? 
 Because we can't! 
Son, l love you. 
You have to know l'm doing what's best for you. 
You have to know it. 
 Good afternoon, Tony. 
 (Tony) Mr Chapelle. 
Looks like they're bringing in the big guns. 
What do you think they're gonna do to Jack? 
Not gonna name a street after him. 
(door opens)  Hey, Jack. 
 Ryan. lt's good to see you. 
l've got five priority cases on my desk this morning. 
 Your name's on each one. 
 l can imagine that. 
 Look, l just wanted to say... 
 Hang on. 
You were saying? 
At approximately 12.15 
l got a phone call from Agent Nina Myers, telling me to assemble the team at CTU. 
District Manager Walsh... 
Where's Teri Bauer? 
 l don't know. 
 Who are you with? 
FBl. And you? 
 CTU. 
 Just waiting for the rest of my debrief team. 
We're interrogating some of the injured prisoners they're bringing into the clinic. 
Thanks. 
l'm with CTU. Where's Teri Bauer? 
 She was moved to room seven. 
 Thank you. 
Teri? 
 There you are. 
 Nina. l didn't know you were gonna be here. 
Yeah. 
Hi, Kim. We didn't officially meet. 
l'm Nina Myers. l work with your dad. 
Hi. 
l'm just so glad the two of you are OK. 
l'll be here until you're done. So if you need 
anything, l'll be down in the waiting room. 
Nina, what's happening with Jack? 
He's being questioned. 
 ls he in trouble? 
 That depends. 
He broke a few laws, but he did it to save you and Kim, so l think they'll understand. 
lf he doesn't piss 'em off first. 
My thoughts exactly. 
Guess you know Jack just about as well as l do, huh? 
l'm sending someone to your house to pick up some clean clothes. 
What's gonna happen when we get released from here? Why can't we just go home? 
Until we know exactly what happened, we'll take every precaution to keep you safe. 
When do we get to see my dad? 
l don't know. A lot of things have to happen 
first. Some people will wanna talk to you. 
Division, Secret Service, us. 
Cos, you see, this wasn't a simple crime. 
This was a terrorist conspiracy, and unfortunately you were in the middle of it. 
But that's over now. 
 Nina, wait. 
 Yeah? 
l don't know the details about last night, but l understand you're a big part of the reason why we're still alive. 
So thank you. 
Sure. 
l'll be out here. 
 Excuse me. 
 Yes? 
Nina Myers, CTU. ls that man FBl? 
 Yeah. He's with me. 
 He was in three. l'd like to speak with him. 
Sure. But he wasn't in three. We just got here. 
Stu? 
 Who else is here from the bureau? 
 lt's just the two of us. 
 Are you sure? 
 Of course l'm sure. 
The reason l didn't call CTU immediately for backup? 
l was worried things could get out of control. 
My wife and daughter were in the compound. 
 But you did eventually call? 
 Yes. Yes. 
The second Teri and Kim were with me, l called Alberta Green. 
You did what any loving father would do. 
Unfortunately, as you know, our procedures don't allow for any deviation from protocol. 
l can't reinstate you, Jack. 
Have you heard a thing l've said? 
D'you understand what's happening? 
Senator Palmer is still in great danger. 
Now that my family are safe, l can help you. 
As of now, your case will be put in the hands of the Justice Department. 
Justice Department! 
Yes, under the circumstances, l had to break the rules of procedure to protect my family! 
But l never deviated from my assignment to protect Palmer. And you know that! 
Yes, l know that. That's what might keep you 
from going to prison, but that's not my call. 
We don't have time for this. l have come 
in contact with suspects who are still at large. 
And l guarantee you, they have a contingency plan. l am a resource. l can identify them. 
You wanna arrest me, do that later. But let me 
help Palmer get through the rest of this day! 
 l'll ask Alberta if she wants you... 
 She's been here for four hours, Ryan! 
(phone rings) Chapelle. 
(woman) ls Nina Myers cleared to talk with Bauer? 
 Yeah. 
 l'll patch you through. 
That's fine. 
OK. We're through here. lt's Nina. 
 Keep him company. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Hey. lt's Jack. 
 How's it going? 
They're handing me over to the Justice Department. 
 Did you explain why you did what you did? 
 Yes, of course l did. 
l think Alberta Green's trying to make a career move. How's Teri and Kim? 
They seem OK, considering what they've been through. 
How long will they have to stay there? 
A couple of hours, then they'll be transferred for questioning. 
Nina, look, l can't thank you enough for being there. Really, l appreciate it. 
 Nina? 
 Yeah, l'm here. 
What's wrong? 
When Walsh said someone in the agency was working against Palmer, didyou sense it was more than one person? 
He didn't say, but l've been thinking about this too. Someone had to recruit Jamey. 
So for now you have to assume that someone else is on the inside. Maybe not CTU. 
District, Division, maybe Secret Service. 
Why? What are you thinking? 
l just wanna make sure that Teri and Kim are safe here. 
What do you mean? At the clinic? 
 Yeah. 
 Why wouldn't they be? 
l don't know. l'm just exhausted 
and probably getting paranoid. 
 What's going on there? 
 Nothing, Jack. Don't worry. 
 l will make sure that they are safe here. 
 OK. Thanks. Can l talk to them? 
 They're being examined right now. 
 OK. Get back to me as soon as they can talk. 
 Yeah. 
 OK. Thank you. 
Any more information on the backup plan to assassinate Palmer? 
The information that came in matched what we got from Division's database. 
 Looks like things are falling into place. 
 Give me the headlines. 
Three shooters, possibly hired to kill Palmer in case the breakfast attempt failed. 
There's Jovan Myovic. 
Entered the country two days ago. 
Mishko Suba, also from the Balkans, came in three days ago through Florida. 
And the other one? 
 No name yet. 
 Keep looking. 
lf he's connected with the other two, we need to know where he is and what he's doing. 
Let's leave it right there! 
Get the equipment in the shed. 
l'll be in to brief you on our exit strategy. 
Let's move it out! 
 Mr Drazen, it's Kevin. 
 Yes? 
 We just got to the transfer point. 
 What about Gaines? 
 He's dead. 
 l see. 
Listen, Mr Drazen, when Gaines hired me for this, l told him there were some defects in his plan that could be exploited. 
Not to say l told you so, but l'm not surprised that any of this happened the way it did. 
 ls there a point to any of this? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. l can fix it for you. 
 lnteresting. And how can you do that? 
l've done this before. l know people. 
When l was working for the DEA in Florida, l was able to get to a witness that no one else could find. 
12 hours later he was dead. Problem solved. 
You get what l'm saying? 
l appreciate the offer, Kevin, but as you Americans so often say, plan B is already in effect. 
What does that mean? 
Hello?! Drazen! 
Get... away from me. 
ls there anything left in the truck? 
Go to hell. 
(Palmer) Get me three copies of this report as soon as you can get it. 
Are we saying Palmer should stay in for the duration? 
No. No, he's gotta get outta California now. 
The backup shooters are in LA and they're gonna come after him. 
All right. Leave that with me. Let me look 
it over one more time before l do anything. 
Tony? 
Yeah? 
Are you satisfied with your position here? 
Sure. 
Because l always had the impression you had too much talent to be a number three at CTU. 
What do you want me to do, Alberta? 
See, that's what l like about you. 
You get right to the point. 
Before Chapelle makes his final evaluation of Jack, he'll wanna talk to you. 
 Why me? 
 Because you called in the lockdown. 
Let's face it, Nina is hardly impartial when it comes to Jack, and Chapelle knows that. 
And you want me to tell him what? 
The truth. That even though 
Jack's family was in danger, there were ways he could have dealt with it without compromising the integrity of CTU. 
lf Jack had confided in you from the beginning, you never would have had to call George Mason to lock things down. Am l right? 
Jack? 
Alberta. 
Chapelle asked me to debrief you, personally. 
Fine. 
l have to tell you, this is your turf. 
l feel uncomfortable debriefing you. 
Don't. lt's quite all right. 
lt's pointless to ask you questions. 
Why don't you tell me what you think l need to know? Save us some time. 
l went through the events with Chapelle. 
What you need are the threads and lDs so you'll know how to proceed tactically. 
 Do you mind? 
 No. But before we start, l need something. 
 What's that? 
 l wanna phone my wife and daughter. 
They don't know what's going on with me over here. l wanna ease their minds. 
Sorry, Jack. l can't do that. 
So why don't we dispense with the ''Are you all right, Jack? l feel uncomfortable'' crap? 
OK. You wanna talk straight? 
Fine. Don't handle me. 
Tell me what you know. 
You need to get ahold of Langley. Have them 
open up their Balkan terrorist database. 
Why the Balkans? 
The people behind the hit on Palmer are financed by a Ted Cofell. 
He was a banker with family connections in that area of Europe. 
Was? 
He died three hours ago. 
Keep talking. 
The money that we traced came back to Ted Cofell lndustries, which is based here in LA. 
(phone rings)  CTU. Almeida. 
 Tony, l have a problem. 
20 minutes ago a man identified himself to me as FBl, but l know he's lying. 
How d'you know? 
Cos l met the only two FBl agents assigned here, and they knew nothing about him. 
Maybe the right hand's not talking to the left. 
l don't think it's that. Can you send someone 
over? l need to pull some prints off a phone. 
Sure. Anything else? 
 No, that's it. Just hurry. 
 All right. You got it. 
And the senator wanted to get your approval on these. 
 What are they? 
 The photographs for Time magazine. 
Oh, right. l wanted to see those. 
 These are nice. 
 Uhhuh. 
 (Keith) Mom? 
 Hey. Um... 
 Use that one, Patty. 
 OK. Thanks. 
So what's goin' on? 
 l talked to Dad. 
 And? 
And l'm a little confused. 
All night he's been trying to convince me to air this thing about Nicole's rape and about... 
No. We don't need to worry 
about that right now. 
No, that's just it. We do have to. 
l know about Dr Ferragamo. 
 And l know that fire wasn't an accident. 
 Keith. 
 But Dad wants to keep it quiet. 
 Don't get worked up. 
 l am worked up! 
 Hey. 
Look, covering up an accident is one thing, but we're talkin' about murder. 
 l'm goin' to the police. 
 No. 
 l'm sorry, l've made up my mind. 
 You will listen to me, Keith! 
 lt is not your decision to make. 
 l can't believe you're saying this. 
That's because you don't know what it takes to raise a family, to keep it safe. 
 What does this have to do with safe? 
 lt has everything to do with it. 
Nothing is simple in life. 
Sometimes you just have to make a decision. 
That is what we did, and you will respect that. 
Do you understand me? 
l understa... 
Have Patty pack up your things. 
We have to leave the state. 
Why? 
They've done a threat assessment. 
lt's too dangerous for us to stay. 
 Where are we going? 
 Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada. 
 Have you discussed this with Mike? 
 Of course. 
He believes this isn't a call they would make unless the threat was imminent. 
l thought you said that the man from the breakfast, Jack Bauer, was in custody. 
He is, but he may not be working alone. 
There are others... that are after me. 
So let's go. 
Let's get our things together. Now. 
Come on, Keith. Keith. 
 You didn't call it in. 
 My family were in danger, so l kept CTU out. 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 (woman) Tony, Chapelle's ready for you. 
All right. Thanks. 
 Hey, Tony. 
 Sir. 
Have a seat. 
As you know, we have an important decision to make pretty soon about Jack Bauer, whether or not to pursue criminal and disciplinary charges. 
 l understand. 
 l'm not gonna lie to you. 
This may boil down to your testimony, as you seem to be the most impartial observer. 
Let me save you some time, Mr Chapelle. 
l'm not the biggest fan of Jack Bauer. 
l don't agree with the way he delegates authority, and l don't like the way he runs operations. 
But since midnight last night, you won't get me to disapprove of a single action he's taken. 
Fair enough. 
You talked to Nicole? 
Yeah. They're taking care of her. 
They're gonna meet us at the airport. 
Yeah. l'll tell him. Thanks. 
That was the Pentagon. 
Remember after the incident at the breakfast you asked me to check out Jack Bauer? 
Who is he? 
He used to be in Special Forces. 
Led a six-man team into Kosovo a couple of years ago. 
That's what it was. 
The Drazen mission. 
Yeah. He hand-picked 
his men and trained them. 
Only Bauer survived. 
He blames me for the loss of his team. 
That's what this is about. 
Patty, can you get this to Mrs Palmer? 
l didn't have time to pack it. 
 Aren't you coming with me? 
 No. l'm taking a later flight. 
l have an aunt in town. l promised my mom 
l'd visit. She's in a nursing home. 
Sure. 
OK. We need to get destinations on that one. 
Make sure you fax that to the other office. 
 Hold the elevator, please. 
 Sure. 
 Elizabeth? 
 l can't stay long. 
Then we shouldn't waste any time. 
(Nina) Anything? 
 Nothing. 
 That can't be. l saw him holding the phone. 
 Those prints have been wiped off. 
 lt doesn't make sense. 
Housekeeping didn't come in here. 
This wasn't housekeeping. There's not 
a single print anywhere on that phone. 
lt was done by a professional. 
Yes. The weapons would be 
consistent with that scenario. 
(phone rings) Excuse me. 
 Green. 
 lt's Nina. 
Can l move Teri and Kim Bauer to the safe house now? 
Are they done? 
Everything but the debrief, but l can do that once we're over there. 
 Fine. Do it. 
 Thank you. 
The ultrasound showed the remnants of a small follicular cyst. 
 A cyst? 
 Yes. lt burst. That's what caused the pain. 
The good news is, it's the most common type of ovarian cyst and it's completely benign. 
 Why did it burst? 
 Could have been the assault. 
Can also happen when your uterus enlarges. 
When was your last period? 
Last month. lt's due some time this week. 
l'd like to do a pregnancy test, just to rule it out. 
OK. 
Excuse me. Teri, we need to go now. 
Get your things. 
We're not finished here yet. 
 Change of plan. We need to move. 
 ls something wrong? 
We wanna get you and Kim to the safe house now rather than wait. 
 Aren't we safe here? 
 You're just not as contained as we'd like. 
Kim, come on. 
 Kim, get your things. 
 Now? 
Now. Go. 
Here's the test l was telling you about. 
l want you to take it as soon as possible. 
Thank you. Thank you for everything. 
They're leaving now. 
His name was Theodore Cofell. 
We traced his company to Los Angeles from money that had been rerouted from the Balkans. 
Senator Palmer. 
 Can l help you, sir? 
 l'm here to see Jack Bauer. 
 Walsh isn't answering. 
 As soon as you reach him, you find me. 
 ls this the crew list from the 747? 
 Yeah. 
Want a maintenance history on the plane? 
 No. Let's assume this was not an accident. 
 Why? 
The flight originated out of Berlin, where Walsh said the shooter was coming from. 
l need a breakdown of crew and passenger lists: political affiliation, criminal record, country of origin and residence. 
 Jack. 
 What? 
 You wanna tell me what's goin' on tonight? 
 What's going on? 
Besides a 747 falling out of the sky and a threat on a presidential candidate's life? 
Yeah, that's right. Besides that. 
George Mason comes in here, disappears up in your office for half an hour, then he limps out. 
What's that all about? 
Tell him, Jack. 
 Fine. l will. 
 Nina... 
The agents Jack brought down on bribery charges last year were friends of Mason. 
Mason's looked for payback ever since. 
Tonight he made accusations about Jack, as well as some other people in this office. 
Now, in case you haven't noticed, Jack doesn't have a lot of tolerance for criticism. 
l need that right away. 
All right, look, l'll get you that list within the hour. 
Thank you. 
That was quite a story. 
Better than the truth. 
(man) Did you get the lD? 
(Mandy) Yes. 
When you came to Jack's rescue back there with your little performance, it reminded me of something. 
Yeah? What? 
When we came into work together, about a month ago, Lisa made some wisecrack. 
You came up with this great BS story, early breakfast meeting with District Three. 
l was really impressed with how convincing a liar you were. 
What's your point, Tony? 
l still wanna know what happened with Jack and Mason. 
 l already told you. 
 And l don't believe you. 
 Maybe l should ask Mason. 
 A presidential candidate's life's at stake. 
Maybe you should get back to work. 
(Teri) l think we need to turn right here. 
There it is. 
Janet! 
Janet! 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
 So, have you found the girls yet? 
 No, we just got here. 
Janet's car's out front. 
l just got into the store. 
 l'll wait till you check it out. 
 No, let me call you back. 
 Teri, l'll hold. 
 Kim! 
 Teri? 
 Kim! 
Teri? 
Kim! 
They were here. 
( ''Did You Forget'' by Perry Farrell) (coughing) lt's OK. 
 What did you give her? 
 Nothing she didn't want. 
Look, my dad is a government agent. 
l thought you said your dad was dead. 
Well, he's not. And if l'm not home in the 
next half hour, he's going to be all over this. 
 l told you you should've given her a roofie. 
 l'm serious. You two are toast. 
 She's giving me a headache, dude. 
 Just chill, OK? 
You chill. 
(music gets louder) (man) Walsh. 
 Did anyone see you come in? 
 No. 
 You weren't followed? 
 Take it easy. 
No, l'm not gonna take it easy. l'm not. 
l should never have called you. 
lf you have evidence that someone in the agency's involved in a plot against David Palmer, then you had no choice. 
Here. lt's all yours. l'm outta this. 
Wait. Wait. Wait. A key card? 
Yeah, it's just a simple key card. The kind 
we use to get in and out of the building. 
 l don't get it. 
 Normally, the magnetic stripe has just an access code on it, but the stripe can hold a ton of data. 
On this one, l found a file filled with references to Palmer. 
 But what's the point? 
 To smuggle confidential information. 
These get in and out of restricted areas without any scrutiny. 
 l need you to be reachable through the day. 
 You said after tonight l'm done. 
l can't help it, Scott. Until we diffuse 
this situation, l need to be able to find you. 
l find out there's an agency conspiracy to kill Palmer, and the moment l realised what l'd stumbled onto, l put my wife and kid on a plane. 
l couldn't even say why. l've been with 
the agency long enough to know what this is. 
 This is your thing now. l'm out. 
 Scott, what you did took a lot of courage. 
l'm just asking you to hang in there with me a little longer. 
l did my part. Get someone else. 
There is no one else. 
You got me for another 24 hours, then l'm joining my family. 
l know Palmer gets a lot of death threats, but this one has weight. 
 (man) We'll have to deal with it later. 
 No. Make adjustments in your schedule. 
Notify his advance team and tighten up security on your end. 
 (man) At this point... 
 (phone rings)  l've gotta go. l'll update you in an hour. 
 One hour? 
Yes. Fine. 
 Teri. 
 (man) Jack, l needyou. 
 Richard? 
 Yeah. 
l'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza. l got two shooters 
tryin' to hit me, and an agent down. 
What's going on? 
l got hard information about who's behind the Palmer hit. 
lsley can get there before me. 
He's in the area. 
No! Don't call anyone. We still 
don't know who we can trust, Jack. 
 Just... get me outta here. 
 l'll be there in ten minutes. 
 l'll be on the roof. 
 (gunshot) Richard? Richard? 
(phone rings)  Hello. 
 Hey, what's goin' on? ls Kim at the store? 
 No. She's not here. 
 l thought you said you saw their car. 
 Yeah, well, we think she left with the boys. 
 This York, does he know either of the boys? 
No, but one of them, Dan, works here. 
Jack, l'm starting to worry. 
Can't you get over here? 
Not right now. l don't have time to explain, 
but some very bad things are happening. 
Our daughter is missing. That's pretty bad. 
Teri, she's not missing. She's partying. 
Kim's smart enough to know her limits. 
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you should come 
over here and see what those limits are, Jack. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing. 
We're gonna wait here for them to come back for the car. 
Just call me when you're done with your emergency, OK? 
l will. l'm sorry, OK? 
 l'll call you as soon as l can. 
 Bye. 
( ''Losing an Edge'' by Rocket Science) Look, l know it seems like we're these really bad guys, but we're cool. l swear. 
There's just some stuff we gotta do. Just go 
along with it and you guys won't get hurt. 
l don't even know what you want me to go along with. ls this some fraternity stunt? 
 Yeah. Somethin' like that. 
 Fine. Whatever. 
l will tell your friends whatever you want me to. Just let us go. 
 lt's not that simple. These people expect... 
 What people? 
(coughing) Dan, pull over. She's choking. 
 She's not breathing, you idiot! 
 l don't care. 
(coughs)  Pull over! 
 Get back! 
Don't be a moron! 
Don't be a bitch. 
(TV) Brush fires set offby the wreckage are making the prospect oflocating possible survivors ofFlight 221 even more improbable. 
Debris from thejumbojet appears to be spread over a wide area... 
 Has Carl called yet? 
 No, not yet. 
 Let me know as soon as he does. 
 OK. 
lt's 20 after one. Weren't the kids 
supposed to be back by now? 
They stopped to get pizza after the rally. 
 Have you seen this? 
 Yeah. 
lt's horrible. 
Look... l'm sorry l walked away before. 
What did Maureen Kingsley say to you on the phone? 
lt's nothing serious. 
l'm overreacting to everything right now. 
Today's gonna be the second most important day of my life. 
And what would the first one be? 
Well, l think you know. 
Well, l still like to hear you say it. 
All right. 
The most important day of my life... 
was when l hit the game-winning three against DePaul at the Final Four. 
You just lost my vote, Senator. 
Good night. Don't let this get to you. 
 Thanks, honey. 
 Good night. 
We already know about that. 
We got another way around security. 
No. l don't want an explanation, 
l just want him in place. Hold on. 
Gaines. Yeah, 
l'm finishing up with him now. 
 All right. Get back to me. 
 Mmhm. 
Hey, Mandy. 
 ls everything put together there? 
 Yeah. 
l'll get back to you. 
 You want somethin' to drink? 
 Nuhuh. 
So, they'll be ready to go by the time you get there. Leave now. 
lt's all there. 
 What are you doing this summer? 
 Not interested. 
 You haven't even heard what l have to offer. 
 l don't care. l'm gonna disappear for a while. 
So, when do l get the lD? 
Soon. 
 Myers. 
 Nina, it's Jack. 
 ls this a secure line? 
 No. You want me to transfer it? 
No time. l need an entry code. 
 Entry code? Where are you? 
 l had to take care of somethin'. 
 Why didn't you check out with me? 
 Nina, just give me the entry code, OK? 
l'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza, north garage. 
Dunlop. Got it. 
9-1-3-6-7-star. 
 l'm in. 
 Jack... 
Jack? 
 Richard, you OK? 
 l'm fine. 
 You said there were two shooters? 
 At least. 
 They look like they were ours? 
 l couldn't tell. 
 How high does this conspiracy go? 
 l don't know yet, Jack. 
 Did you see anyone downstairs? 
 No one. 
 ls this the only way out? 
 This is it. 
OK. 
 l'm sorry. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Come here. 
Come here. 
Wow. 
You look just like Martin Belkin. 
How'd they do that? 
Plastic surgery. 
That's amazing. 
So, you're gonna kill David Palmer, huh? 
 Hey, where's Jack? 
 l don't know. 
 l thought you were on the phone with him. 
 No, that was Division. 
Really? 
This is a military organisation. There's 
a chain of command. l'm your superior. 
l tell you what l want and you don't question it. Got it? 
 All right. l can accept that. 
 Good. 
 There's somethin' you gotta deal with too. 
 Yeah, what? 
You can boss me around all you want here, but when you and l punch out, we're somethin' else... OK? 
OK, Tony. 
OK. 
OK, we're clear. 
Give me your tie. l wanna fix this. 
(door slams)  l should've been more careful. 
 They could've followed Baylor. 
This was my fault. l set it up wrong. 
We were sitting ducks. 
 l'm sorry to put you through this, Jack. 
 Don't you ever say that to me. 
You of all people. l owe you my life. 
Across the mezzanine there's a corridor that leads to a service exit. 
We're gonna take that straight to the street. 
My car is right there. You OK? 
Good. Let's get outta here. 
Take the wall. 
Jack! 
We gotta find out who sent these guys. 
l'm gonna go lD 'em. 
Hey. 
OK. 
What the hell is this supposed to be? 
Give him the lD. 
lt's OK. This is gonna work out better 
for both of us. l figured it all out. 
No, you don't figure anything out. This is 
not your play. Now, where is the damn lD? 
lt is my play, since l'm the only one who knows where ''the damn lD'' is. 
Go ahead. 
l didn't find anything useful in the back. 
Work schedule. Look. 
Dan: Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. 
 Great. ls there a contact number? 
 No. And the office is locked. 
 My husband might be able to help with this. 
 How would he be able to do that? 
 This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message. 
 He turned his cellphone off. 
How would your husband be able to help us? 
He works for the government. He has 
access to those things. Hang on a second. 
(phone rings)  CTU. Nina Myers. 
 Hi. Nina, it's Teri Bauer. 
 ls Jack there? 
 Teri, Jack's not here. 
He turned his phone off. 
l wonder if you could help me. 
Sure. What do you need? 
l need the name and number of the owner of a furniture store in the valley, Van Nuys. 
Uh, Paladio's Furniture. 
That's not really something l should do. 
Can it wait till l talk to Jack? 
No, not really. Um... Nina, it's Kim. 
She took off with some kids l don't know. 
One of the boys, Dan, works here. 
l was hoping to contact the owner. 
All right, give me a couple minutes. l'll see 
what l can do. What's your cell number? 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 There you are! You had quite a turnout. 
 Oh, yeah, it was pretty insane. 
l thought l heard the sound of the young and the reckless generation. 
 Dad, what are you doin' up? 
 Hey, Dad. 
 How you doin'? 
 Good. 
 Not enough hours in the day. 
 How did it go? 
Mom, it was huge. 
l wish you could've been there. 
 l wish l could've been there, too. 
 l'm dead. l'll see you guys in the morning. 
OK. Good night, sweetie. Get some good rest, 
because they're gonna wake you up early. 
 l will. Good night. 
 l love you, honey. 
(phone rings)  So, how was it? 
 Aw, Dad, it was unbelievable. 
The chancellor introduces me, and l'm totally killin'. 
And just as l'm finishin', Green Day starts to play ''Time of Your Life''. lt was huge! 
Hold on. 
 Carl. 
 What's the problem? 
 l got a call tonight from Maureen Kingsley. 
 Yeah. So what? 
 l don't wanna talk over the phone. 
 OK, l'll come by in the morning. 
No. We need to take care of this now. 
Fine. 
lt's hard to know with teenage girls whether they're angry at you or just angry. 
l know. 
l did feel guilty, though, when Jack and l separated. 
Separated? l didn't know. 
We're back together. 
l admire that, tryin' to work through the problems together. 
My ex left and never looked back, went home to Australia. 
She hasn't spoken with Janet or me for almost ten years. 
l'm really sorry, Alan. 
(phone rings)  Hello. 
 Teri, l got it. 
Oh, great. Um, hang on a second. 
All right, go ahead. 
555-2937. 
Nina, that's great. Thank you so much. 
l really appreciate it. 
OK. Bye. 
Owner's name and phone number. 
(man) Please leave a message. 
ls anybody home? Mr Nowrasteh, 
if you're there, please pick up. 
My daughter is with one of the boys who works at your store, Dan. 
l need to talk to you. l'm in your store. Please 
call me. My name is Teri and my number is... 
Then he said ''Tell your dad to reserve the Lincoln bedroom for us when we tour.'' 
l bet he did. 
Hello, Mrs Palmer. 
l'm Aaron Pierce, Secret Service. 
 ls there a problem? 
 l need to speak with the senator. 
All right, l'll go get him for you. 
David? 
 Where is he, Patty? 
 l don't know. l thought he was in there. 
 Palmer has left. He is exposed. Find him. 
 Would you tell me what's going on? 
lf he left in one of the vehicles, it'll show up on our GPS. 
 Would you tell me what's going on? 
 We're adding another layer of security. 
Why? 
We have a very high confidence that there will be an attempt on his life sometime today. 
 (woman) You know who l think that was? 
 (man) l think it was the senator, wasn't it? 
 Stay close, Richard! 
 l'm right behind you. 
l'm gonna get you outta here. 
Jack. 
Jack, listen to me. 
Take this card and give it to Jamey. 
Baylor said that we could trust her. 
 Richard, don't move. You'll draw fire. 
 Take the card. Give it to Jamey. 
She'll match it to a computer. 
Find the computer, you've got the dirty agent. 
Richard! 
Farrell. 
 Jamey, it's me. 
 What do you need? 
Two agency personnel were killed at 2350 Dunlop Plaza. 
Phone Division and get their bodies picked up. 
 OK. 
 That's not all. 
You know the key cards we use to get in and out of Division? 
l've got one. l need you to pull some data off 
of it. Do you have anything that can read it? 
Yeah. But if you're in your car, 
just send it to me now. 
 How? 
 Use your mobile scanner. 
Switch it from optical to magnetic. 
Hold on. 
l'm sending this directly. Walsh said you can 
trace the person whose computer encoded it. 
 Yeah. l can match the electronic signature. 
 Good. Do it. 
 Come on. 
 What are you gonna do to me? 
Take you to the prom. 
 Come on. Get out! 
 lt's gonna be OK. 
Just tell her what you want her to do, and then she'll do it. 
l said get out! 
lt's time to call Mommy. You tell her that 
you're OK, you're at a party, you're sorry,  and you'll see her in a couple hours. 
 Go to hell! 
Gaines said not to hurt her, remember? 
Yeah. 
Fine. 
 (Janet screams)  Call your mom! 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 (sobs) Mom? 
Kim, is that you? 
 Hello? 
 Mom... 
 Honey, where are you? 
 l'm at a party. 
 What? 
 l'm at a party. 
 With Janet York, right? 
 Yeah. How did you know that? 
l'm standing here with her dad. Do you have 
any idea how worried we were about you? 
 Can l talk to Janet? 
 Honey, Janet's dad wants to talk to her. 
 She went for a walk. l'll tell her to call. 
 She went for a walk. 
Listen, we're OK and l'm really sorry l did this. l mean it. 
l'll be home as soon as l can get a ride. 
You're not waiting for a ride. 
We'll come pick you up. Where are you? 
 l don't even know how we got here. 
 Kim? 
Kim, honey, this is not the night you wanna shine me on, l promise you. 
 l gotta go. 
 Kim! 
Mom, l love you. 
''l love you.'' 
Nice touch. ln the van. 
 What happened? 
 l can't believe it. 
She's at this party, she said she was sorry and she'd be back. 
 What about Janet? 
 She's fine. 
What's wrong? 
She said ''l love you''. 
She never says that. 
(Jamey) l got a match on the card. 
Do you need a confidence on this? 
Yes. My eyes only. Send it. 
 Thanks, Jamey. 
 You got it. 
 (nurse) She's crashing. Get Dr Collier. 
 (nurse #2) She's on her way in. 
 What have we got? 
 (nurse) BP's dropping. She's in vtach. 
 (anaesthetist) BP's 90/50. 
 Give her an amp of epi. Let's go at 200. 
(nurse) Yes, Doctor. 
(anaesthetist) Epi's in. 
 (nurse) Start. 
 (Dr Collier) Clear. 
 (nurse #2) Nothing. 
 Again. 300. 
 (nurse #2) 300. Start. 
 (Dr Collier) Clear. 
 (anaesthetist) Blood pressure still dropping. 
 (nurse) Nothing. Doctor? 
 (Dr Collier) Go again. 
 (nurse) 360. Charge. 
 (Dr Collier) Clear. 
 (nurse) Clear. 
(nurse) No rhythm. 
(nurse #2) One more time. 
 (Dr Collier) Charge. 
 (nurse) 360. Charge. 
(nurse) Clear. 
(cellphone rings)  Hello? 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 l'm still in the West Side. 
 You said you were coming here. 
 l'll be there soon. ls Janet out of surgery? 
There's been a complication. 
They're working on it now. 
Listen. Do not let anyone near Janet 
who doesn't belong there. 
 What do you mean? 
 l think she might be in danger. 
 From whom? 
 l'll explain later. 
 Until then do not mention this to anyone. 
 OK. 
 l'll be there soon. 
 OK. 
(Dr Collier) Clear. 
 Whose car? 
 Penticoff was paid to pick it up and get rid of this. 
 Oh, my God. Who is it? 
 That's what you're gonna find out. 
Somehow all of this is connected to Senator Palmer. 
 They didn't leave much of his face. 
 Or his fingers or teeth. 
 ls the forensic here? 
 Not yet. He's on his way. 
Call me as soon as you got a name. 
Nina! l need a favour. 
They're starting to add up, Jack. 
Don't tell anyone l requisitioned this for personal use. 
Personal use? 
Yes. Could you please patch me 
through to hospital security? 
Thank you. You know Kim's friend, 
the girl she went out with tonight? 
She turned up at St Mark's ER. 
She got hit by a car. 
 Think she knows where Kim is? 
 lt's my only chance. 
l'm meeting Teri at the hospital now. 
Get me that name. 
Yes, hello. My name is Jack Bauer. 
l'm a federal agent. 
l'm coming to you now but l wanted to give you a heads-up on one of your patients. 
l think her life might be in danger. Yes, l'll be 
there in ten minutes. Her name is Janet York. 
Jack requisitioned a chopper but he didn't log a destination. Where's he going? 
 He's tracking a lead. 
 lgnoring protocol again? 
First he assaults an agent, then he breaks a prisoner out of jail. 
 What the hell's going on here? 
 Stop following me, Tony. 
 l prefer to think of it as watching your back. 
 When l need your help, l'll ask for it. 
Yeah, we got a little off schedule but we're good now. 
Yeah, l know. 
You see what happens when you lie? 
 Don't ever lie to me, Rick. 
 l won't. 
Oh, l know you won't. 
 Now bury your friend. 
 Where? 
ln the ground. 
(digging)  We gotta get outta here. 
 What do you mean ''we''? 
l don't know how you hooked up with these guys, but they don't trust you. 
You just saw Gaines kill your friend. 
 He's not gonna let you walk away. 
 Shut up. 
The only way either of us is gonna stay alive is... 
l said shut up! 
(TV) Sources say the senator spent the night working on a party-unification speech which he's set to deliver later... 
 How did you get past Secret Service? 
 Good to see you too, Sherry. 
Listen. David has a meeting and the polls 
open in an hour, so whatever you're doing... 
 David asked me to come. 
 Why, Carl? 
l don't know. 
l've gotta get ready, and so do you. 
Mm-hm. 
What's the big emergency, David? 
l thought we had a game plan. 
We did. Until l found out my son lied to me. 
That he's been lying to me for seven years. 
What's going on? 
Why would Maureen Kingsley run a story this big unless it were true? 
Are you saying you believe her accusation about Keith? 
l'm saying my son was involved in Gibson's death and you covered it up. 
 Not only from the law, from me. 
 David... 
Someone altered the hospital records to make it look like Keith wasn't involved. 
That could only have been you. 
Look me in the eye... 
and tell me what happened. 
You sure you wanna know? You might not 
like what you find if you open that door. 
lt's already open and l'm listening. 
The night Gibson raped Nicole, while Sherry was still at the hospital and you were flying back, Keith went to see Gibson. 
How do you know this? 
Keith told me. Your son came to me, David. 
He said Gibson pulled a knife. 
l took him at his word. lt was an accident. 
He was defending himself. 
So you made it look like Keith was never there? 
As far as l was concerned, he never was. 
Why didn't we just go to the police? lf it was 
self-defence, Keith would have been cleared. 
Maybe, but your career would have been over. 
Gibson was white, David. 
 l still wouldn't have covered it up. 
 Are you so sure? 
lt was my decision, not yours. 
l don't want you anywhere near me... 
or my family... ever again. 
You have never needed me more than you need me now. 
Get out. 
Before you finish crucifying me... 
save some nails for your wife. 
 Sherry didn't know anything about this. 
 No? 
How do you think Keith got to me in the first place? 
 (Rick) What are you doing? 
 (Kim) What does it look like? 
 l said l don't need... 
 l heard. 
Think l wanted to leave Janet there? 
Everything just got so crazy. 
All we had to do was hang out with you guys. 
Nobody was supposed to get hurt. 
None of this was supposed to go down. 
 What did you think was gonna happen? 
 l don't know. 
 Smoking that's really gonna help. 
 l just can't believe this is happening. 
lt is, and you can sit there feeling sorry for yourself or you can get up and help me figure out a way to get us out of here. 
 Claude Davenport. Hospital security. 
 Jack Bauer. Thanks for mobilising. 
l put a man at each end of the lCU corridor. 
Should lock it down. 
 They know not to let anyone in or out? 
 Only hospital staff. 
 Good. 
 Tell me what this is about? 
l wish l could. 
 Teri. 
 Jack. 
 Thank God. Thank God. 
 lt's OK. lt's OK. l'm here now. 
Oh, don't leave me. 
Don't ever leave me again. OK? 
l promise l won't. 
l'll be walking the floor if you need anything. 
Thank you, Claude. 
lt's gonna be OK. 
 Tell me about Janet. 
 She's stable. 
 Can she talk? 
 No, not yet. 
What did you mean before about her being in danger? Danger from whom? 
Someone who doesn't want her talking to me. 
You must be Jack. 
Alan, yeah. This is my husband Jack. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
Alan's been a great friend tonight, Jack. 
 l'm glad your daughter's OK. 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. 
Gave us a good scare, but she pulled through. 
When she's up to it, l'll need to ask her a few questions. 
But, Jack, my daughter's been through a lot. Um... 
lf the doctor says it's OK. 
The guys that Kim and Janet were with tonight, Teri told me you didn't know them. 
 No. No. Janet never mentioned them. 
 Are you close to Janet? 
She's my daughter. 
 But you don't know who she goes out with. 
 Jack. 
No, not tonight, l didn't, but apparently you didn't either. 
 What are you doing? 
 Trying to find Kim. 
By treating Alan as a suspect? 
He can handle a few questions. 
Understand? Our daughter's missing. 
 Of course l do. 
 Alan, would you excuse us for a minute? 
Jack. What's going on? 
l don't know what you were doing for the last five hours, but Alan was with me. 
 l'm sorry if that makes you feel bad but... 
 Hold on one minute. 
(man) l'm here to see my brother. My bag? 
l'm not gonna open the briefcase. 
l wanna see my brother. 
 (Jack) What's the problem here? 
 There's no problem. 
 What you got in the briefcase? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 What's in the briefcase? 
 Don't worry about it. 
(man) Get off me! 
What is this? 
 lt's my medication. 
 What kind of medication? 
 Ben? Ben? What is going on? 
 (Ben) Virgil's in pain. 
 You guys aren't giving him what he needs. 
 lt's OK. We're taking care of your brother. 
His brother's up in detox... 
(Ben) You guys just don't get it! 
l'm sorry. 
Come on. 
What did Carl want? 
l know about Keith. 
Know what about Keith? 
That he went to Carl to cover up the Gibson boy's death. Keith was there, wasn't he? 
Look, David, just because Carl wants to feed you some story... 
Are you sure you're not the one that's feeding me stories? 
The thing l can't understand, what l keep asking myself, is why you hid this from me. 
 l wanted to tell you, David. 
 But you didn't. 
 Carl said you'd be exposed. 
 Don't put this on Carl. 
You keep your own counsel, Sherry. 
You always have. 
Nothing l say to you is gonna make you feel any better. l know that. 
l did what l thought was right for our family and for your career. 
What about Nicole? 
Did she know too? 
 We were protecting you. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 Or were you protecting your chance  to move into the White House? 
 l am as ambitious as you are, David. 
 That's why you married me. 
 No, l married you because l love you. 
 l thought we were working together. 
 We still are. 
 Well, it doesn't feel that way. 
 David. 
What are you gonna do? 
l don't know. 
Look, you can be as angry at me as you want. 
But l'm telling you, we should do everything we can to keep this thing from coming out. 
lt's too late for that. 
Well, l'm sorry to hear you say that, because you'll lose a lot more than the election if it does. 
Are you prepared to send our son to jail? 
Everything was always a game with Dan. 
He acted like nothing could touch him, and l bought into it. 
 So did Janet. 
 l'd give anything to turn back the clock. 
Me too. 
l spend every day trying to get away from my mother... 
and now l can't stop wishing she were here. 
She must be freaking. 
lt must be nice having a mom you like. 
You don't like yours? 
Not all women are meant to be mothers. 
 l'm sorry. 
 lt's not your problem. 
Rick... 
We gotta get out of here. 
Come with me. 
Let's go. 
Leave the shovel, unless you plan to use it on me. 
When l come back, your friend better be in the ground. 
(phone rings)  Myers. 
 Hey. Any word on the John Doe yet? 
Time of death between 11 and midnight last night. 
Right before we were tipped on the Palmer hit. How close are we to an lD? 
The lab are running his DNA against all databases. 
 That's gonna take too long. 
 We're going as fast as we can. 
Put Jamey on it. 
We've gotta take care of this now. 
 Did you find Kim? 
 No, not yet. 
 ls her friend all right? 
 She will be. 
 What about Teri? How's she holding up? 
 She's fine, Nina. 
What else is going on over there? 
l think l have to apologise for Jack. 
You don't have to apologise for your husband. We're all pretty wound up. 
l think Jack's wound up a little tighter than the rest of us. 
No argument here. 
l guess l've always kind of accepted it as an occupational hazard. 
l thought you told me that he sat behind a desk. 
The truth is half the time l don't know what he's doing. 
He can't tell me. lt's a security thing. 
Must be tough on you. 
Sometimes. 
But you deal with it. 
Right now he's just worried about Kim. 
Yeah, well, hopefully when Janet wakes up, she'll be able to tell us where she is. 
Yeah. 
Look, l gotta go. Call me back 
as soon as you got anything. 
Walk with me for a sec. 
What is it, Jack? 
Why is there all this security here? 
Who wants to hurt Janet? 
Today someone is going to try and kill David Palmer. 
What? 
That's why l was brought in last night. 
Well, why is Janet in danger? 
Because she was with Kim. 
Our daughter's missing. 
How do...? You're saying that relates 
to an assassination attempt? 
They must know that l've been assigned to protect Palmer. 
And you think this person kidnapped Kim? 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! 
Teri. 
l'm so sorry. 
l know this is all happening because of me. 
l've tried to keep a wall between my work and my family and the wall's coming down. 
Now l don't know what to do. 
(Teri) OK. 
OK. 
What do they want from you? 
 l don't know. 
 What are the police doing? 
l haven't been able to call them without risking Kim's life. 
 What if it's too late, Jack? 
 lt's not too late. 
Kim is OK. They took her for a reason 
and that was not to hurt her. 
 OK. 
 Honey. 
l promise you we are going to get her back. 
l'm so sorry. 
 l need you in forensics. 
 l'm about to crack the outer shell. 
You said that two hours ago. 
 This key card is our best lead on the hit. 
 l'm not dropping it. l called in Milo. 
 Milo is an outside contractor. 
 Which is why we can trust him. 
 l can do this. l'm as good as Milo. 
 Not with this kind of thing. And l can't wait. 
Look, Jack wants you on this. 
l'll brief you on the way. 
The deceased is a male Caucasian... 
 (man) Who is it? 
 lt's David. 
Sorry to wake you like this, Mike, but something's come up. 
 l was hoping to keep you out of it. 
 l'm your chief of staff. 
 l shouldn't be kept out of anything. 
 lt was a private matter. 
You're running for president. 
Nothing's private any more. 
 Where are you going? 
 They moved Janet upstairs to the lCU. 
 She's out of Recovery? 
 She's a little groggy, but she's awake. 
 Alan, that's wonderful. 
 Yeah, thank you. 
Alan, l owe you an apology. l'm sorry. 
You don't need to be. l understand 
exactly what you're going through. 
(cellphone rings) Excuse me. 
 Bauer. 
 (Nina) We found something. 
X-rays show a surgical pin in John Doe's ankle. 
Turns out it's not standard. 
Custom-made. One ofa kind. 
So we can trace it back to the surgeon who implanted it. 
Jamey's searching the AMA database, crosschecking it with the manufacturer. 
 Hopefully we'll have his name in an hour. 
 Sooner is better. 
Call me as soon as you got something. 
(Mike) The minute Maureen breaks the story, you'll free-fall in the polls. 
Then the media'll start churning this thing 24-7. 
They'll pick you clean, then go to work on the bones. 
Chances are the party'll try to cut bait. 
So, l'd say you're textbook unelectable. 
 So l'm right to withdraw from the race. 
 No. That's the last thing you should do. 
 You just got through telling me l can't win. 
 l told you what to expect so you can. 
lf we handle this right, l think you can come back from this. 
David, you're the most important presidential candidate this country's had in a long time. 
Like it or not, fair or not, you're making history. 
My son was involved in another man's death. 
 lt was an accident. 
 OK. 
And what if some judge rules it was? 
l mean, how do we justify the cover-up? 
All of them  Sherry, Keith... Nicole  
kept this from the police. 
l don't wanna seem crass, but the important thing is, you didn't cover it up. 
You didn't know. 
What does that say about me? 
Not knowing the most important things about my family. 
l'm not saying it's not a hard sell. 
The election is still six months away. 
The voters know how to forgive. 
You just have to know how to ask for it. 
 Do you still want the job, David? 
 You know l do. 
Then you need to come out with the story yourself before Maureen Kingsley. 
Make it the first thing you say at the breakfast. 
l just don't know how my family's gonna feel about that. 
Find out fast, because you can't do this without them. 
When you come clean, be damn sure your family's standing next to you. 
l did a neurological exam which showed no spinal injury. She suffered multiple fractures, 
 but nothing she can't recover from. 
 What went wrong? 
When they were trying to stop the internal bleeding, she went into cardiac arrest. 
 But she's OK now? 
 The next six hours will be critical. 
 But l'm optimistic. 
 ls it possible to ask her a few questions? 
 When? 
 Soon as possible. Our daughter is missing. 
 Janet was the last person to see her. 
 l'm not happy with her being interrogated. 
l'm just talking about asking her one or two questions. 
l'll leave it up to her father. 
Let me go in first. Make sure she's up to it. 
Thank you. 
You know what we should do when this is over? 
Get some sleep? 
We should take that trip we always talked about. You know, up the coast into Canada. 
Just the three of us. 
That sounds nice. 
(cellphone rings) l'm sorry. Nina's following up a lead. 
That was quick. 
Do what l tell you, Jack, and you might see your daughter again. 
Say yes if you understand me. 
Answer me, Jack. 
Yes. 
Now smile at your wife like nothing's wrong and move away from the doors. 
That's right. We're watching you. 
Walk away now or Kimberly gets a bullet in her head. 
The reception's really bad. l'll be right back. 
Now continue down the hall. 
Come on, Jack. l don't have all day. 
What do you want me to do? 
Go out the north entrance. 
Left. 
Yes, l'm still watching you. 
That's it. Out the north entrance. 
 She's a tough one, your daughter. 
 Yeah, tell me about it. 
 Would you rather go in alone? 
 Do you mind? 
No. 
(heart-rate monitor beeps) Daddy? 
Hello, Janet. 
You've had a rough night, haven't you? 
Who are you? 
Where's my father? 
(beeping speeds up) (Janet gasps for air) (beeping stops)  Where am l going? 
 (Gaines) On your left is a silver Taurus. 
 l see it. 
 Get in. 
 Open the glove compartment. 
 First prove to me that my daughter is alive. 
 Daddy? 
 Kimberly. Are you OK? 
Yeah, they haven't hurt me but l'm... 
There's a metal box inside the glove compartment. Take it out. 
Tuck it in your ear. 
Now say something. 
 lf you hurt my daughter, l will kill you. 
 Good. There's a nice, clear signal. 
You won't need your phone any more. 
Lose it out the window. 
Out the window, Jack. 
The keys are on the seat next to you. 
 Where do you want me to go? 
 You're going to the office like everyone else. 
 CTU? 
 That's where you work. 
(phone ringing)  This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 Oh, God! 
 Sorry. l didn't mean to scare you. 
 Where's Jack? 
 He went to take a call. 
 l need to talk to him. 
 Why? What did Janet say? 
 They were trying to escape. 
 From whom? 
A couple of boys who got too aggressive. 
 She doesn't know if Kim got away. 
 Kim would have called. 
Janet says they were being held in a house up in Bel Air. 
 That's the address? 
 We should give it to the police. 
Jack is the police. 
Oh! 
 Pick up. 
 This is Jack Bauer... 
 Dammit. 
 He's not answering. 
Jack, listen. lt's me again. 
Janet may know where Kimberly is. 
Would you please call me as soon as you get this? OK. 
Jack? 
 Jack? 
 Teri. 
He was just here. 
He promised he wouldn't leave. 
Keep trying on his cell. l'll call the police. 
 No, l have to get there. 
 lf you want, l'll take you. 
 Well, what about Janet? 
 She's sleeping. 
Dr Collier says she's not in any danger and she'll be out for a couple of hours. OK? 
OK. 
l guess l'll just call from the car. 
(man) Go on. Move. 
l'm sorry, man. 
 We're gonna be OK. 
 Maybe. 
 l just spoke to my dad. 
 How? 
 Gaines put me on the phone with him. 
 What does he want from your dad? Money? 
No, l'm not sure, but l don't think it's about money. 
 My dad's gonna get us out. 
 He doesn't even know where we are. 
lt doesn't matter. 
He'll find us. 
What's up, Milo? 
Did you try using an S-box inversion on that key card? 
No. Why? 
lt's just... it's the fastest way 
into a file that size. 
Your hunch on the AMA database paid off. 
We just lD'd our John Doe. 
What happened to your wrist? 
You didn't have that before. 
Yeah, l did. lt happened 
back at the furniture store. 
Oh. 
 (cellphone rings)  Maybe that's Jack. 
 Jack. 
 Teri. Hi, it's Nina Myers. 
 Oh, hi, Nina. 
 l have some important information for Jack. 
He's not answering his cell. 
l know he's with you. 
No, he was, but he went to take a call a couple of minutes ago. l thought it was from you. 
No, l haven't spoken to him in almost half an hour. 
 Then you don't know where he is? 
 No. 
Nina, what's going on? 
Um... 
Listen, Teri, if you hear from him first, can you give him a message? 
Of course. 
There's a murder victim he asked me to lD. 
Tell him the murder victim's name is Alan York. 
l'm sorry. Could you say that again, please? 
Alan York. He's an accountant 
from the valley. 
l'll give the details to Jack when l speak to him. 
Hello? 
 Yeah. 
 Willyou tell Jack? 
Sure. 
Thanks, and ifyou hear from him, tell him to call in. 
 OK. 
 Thanks. 
Everything OK? 
Yeah. That was just someone 
from Jack's office trying to find him. 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day ofmy life. 
The first time you invited me back here, you left your keys in my car. lt was pouring rain. 
We didn't wanna run back, so... 
we used your Hide-A-Key. 
(burglar alarm) What do l do? l don't know what to do. 
l don't know what the code is. 
Just take your time. Maybe it'll come to you. 
Just make this stop! 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 (woman) This is SuperiorAlarms. 
 Could you turn this off? 
 l'll needyour password. 
 What? 
 Ma'am, what is your password? 
 l don't know the password. 
 Are you having an emergency there? 
(Nina) Alan Morgan... Saugus. 
 (man) Yeah. Pacific Electric. 
 (Nina) Got it. All right. Thanks. 
Jack? His name was Alan Morgan. 
He worked for Pacific Electric in Saugus. 
Saugus? OK, he was paid off by Alexis 
to kill the power in a section of the grid. 
 Did you get the coordinates? 26... 
 Double G. Yeah. 
 We need to know where that is. 
 l'll get this to Tony. Shall l stick around? 
 No. Just get hold of me if you get anything. 
 OK. See you at the office. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 (alarm ringing)  None of these are working. 
 (gasps)  Superior Alarms! Stay where you are! 
Please. This woman, she lives here. 
She just forgot her code. 
(alarm stops) Thank you. 
 Teri Bauer? 
 Yes. 
 Do you have any lD? 
 Um... 
Sure. lt's probably in my purse. l'll go check. 
No lD necessary. You obviously live here. 
She just couldn't remember her code. 
l don't usually set it. My daughter must have. 
lt's all right. Just sign this. 
OK. l'm gonna reset the alarm and check 
the contacts around the outside of the house. 
That should take about 15 minutes. 
Thank you. 
(Phil) Thank you. 
Nice, Jack. There's always 
a body count everywhere you go. 
 l gave Hanlin clear orders not to shoot. 
 Where'd he go? 
 (phone rings)  He's over there. 
 Bauer. 
 Jack, it's David Palmer. 
 Yes, Senator? 
 l just heard from my source at the Pentagon. 
l had to twist a lot of arms to get the missing Drazen file. 
 What was in it? 
 Dates and locations. 
lt seems to relate to the last months of Victor Drazen's life. 
 Anything we can use? 
 Maybe. 
The last entry is an address unrelated to everything else. 
 What is it? 
 21911 Kipling, in a city called Saugus. 
 l don't know where that is. 
 Senator, did you just say Saugus? 
 Does that mean anything? 
 Yes. l'll get back to you. 
 Thankyou, Senator. This is going to help. 
 All right. 
(phone rings)  CTU. Almeida. 
 Tony, it's Jack. Take down this address. 
 Go ahead. 
 21911 Kipling Avenue, in Saugus. 
l got a feeling it's in the grid coordinates Nina gave you. 
All right. Hang on. 
Yeah, you're right. 
lt's right in the middle of sector 26-GG. 
 OK. Find out what's there. Get back to me. 
 All right. 
(Mason) Hey. Where are you headed? 
Saugus. Alexis paid this guy off to knock 
the power out at a specific address there. 
 l wanna know why. 
 Slow down. l'm on your side. Fill me in. 
Two and a half hours ago Robert Ellis was killed because he almost found this location. 
We got the address from the Drazen file. 
The senator just gave it to me. 
 OK. Let's go. 
 What do you mean ''let's''? 
You wanna go, l'm your chaperone. 
You want a ride? 
Yeah. 
(Mason) Hop in. 
Where's my brother? 
These guys are gonna be here in 20 minutes. 
l told you, we split up. He said he was gonna 
meet me here with the payoff from Gaines. 
Look, if l was ripping you off, why would l come back here? 
Damn! 
 Where are you going? 
 (Frank) Don't worry about it. 
 What you doing? 
 l'm not waiting here to get killed. 
You're not going. 
She'll tell the police about the deal. 
l don't care about the deal! l came here 
cos l wanted you to help find my mom. 
 That was a dumb idea. 
 You came for Rick. 
 l did not! 
 Don't worry about her. Just leave. 
What do you mean ''Don't worry about me''? 
 Come with me. 
 l can't. 
Whatever's out there is better than in here. 
You heard Frank. 
Nobody leaves until Dan gets back. 
Dan is not coming back! 
What do you mean? 
 l don't know. l just... l don't... 
 What do you mean?! 
 Leave her alone. 
 Where is he? 
 He's dead. 
 What are you talking about? 
Gaines killed him. He was gonna kill me too. 
l swear to God. Gaines was out of control. 
So who's got the money now? 
Nobody. Gaines never paid us. 
These guys are gonna be here in half an hour. 
These are not the kind of guys you come up short with. 
 Then call it off. 
 Too late to call it off! 
What are you gonna say down there today, David? 
 He's gonna tell the truth. 
 Don't start. 
 You've caused enough pain in this family. 
 Sherry! 
Well, l'm sorry, David, but somebody's got to say the words. 
This thing wouldn't have started if Keith hadn't taken matters into his own hands. 
Listen to me. 
Nobody's defending what Keith did. 
He acted on the moment. lt wasn't right. 
That doesn't make you right for covering it up, or make me right for not being there. 
So we're all to blame. 
Let's just leave it at that. 
That's right, Mom. l'm willing to pay the price 
for this, even if it means going to jail. 
You still think this is just about you, don't you? 
When are you gonna get it through your head that your father is running for president of the United States? 
A black man. You don't just decide 
to ease your conscience at the cost of what might be best for this country! 
 l didn't, Mom! 
 Both of you, calm down. 
Look, l kept it inside. And l was gonna 
suck it up for as long as it took. 
But someone murdered Dr Ferragamo. 
You can't tell me hiding that is best for this country. 
You know what? 
l never saw it until just this minute. 
You're your father's son. 
You cover up your weakness with a bunch of bleeding-heart sentimentality. 
 That's enough! 
 Am l wrong?! 
And when are you gonna be man enough to do what it takes to be president?! 
 Nicole? Nicole, you OK? 
 (moans)  (Keith) What's wrong? 
 (Sherry) Nicole... 
Keith, get me some water. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 We need a doctor in here! 
Easy. Easy. 
Easy. Relax. Come here. Gimme your hand. 
(Nicole sobs)  (sobs) l'm sorry, Daddy. 
 Why? About what? 
Honey, talk to me. 
 This is all my fault. 
 Don't you ever say that. 
No, sweetheart. Don't you say that. 
Everything's gonna be fine. 
 No. 
 Yes, it is. 
Sorry, Daddy. l'm sorry. 
Sorry, Daddy. 
l just got in. l've got some more info 
on that location in Saugus. 
OK, hold on. 
 OK, go. 
 lt comes up as a wildlife preserve. 
 Great. We're going to a Sierra Club meeting. 
 Who's with you? 
Mason. A wildlife preserve in Saugus? 
That doesn't make sense. Saugus is 
industrial. What about the GPS maps? 
 l've got three on the way. 
 Good work. 
 We'll callyou when we find what's out there. 
 Yeah, OK. 
So correct me if l'm wrong, but this day basically boils down to a personal vendetta against you and Palmer by the Drazens. 
Yes. Palmer authorised the mission, 
l carried it out. 
Today is the second anniversary of Victor Drazen's death. 
Happy anniversary. 
So what is it we're expecting to find out here in Saugus? 
l don't know yet. 
l gotta tell you, Jack, it never gets dull with you. 
Yeah. 
Look, for what it's worth, l'm sorry about last night. 
What, shooting me in the leg with a trank? 
Don't give it a second thought. 
Needless to say, l was pretty wound up. l feel 
a lot better now, knowing my family's safe. 
 What's the matter? 
 No. Just... beat, you know? 
 Could use a little sleep. 
 Tell me about it. 
 How you doing? 
 l don't know. 
Everything looks familiar but l don't understand any of it. 
l don't feel anything. l should, shouldn't l? 
No. Not yet. 
Sometimes music can help unlock memories. 
(music plays quietly)  Did you ever meet Kim? 
 No. 
You didn't want her to know you were seeing anyone. 
You said she was taking Jack's side in the separation. 
You didn't wanna give her any more reason to be angry with you. 
And why did my husband... Jack... 
Why did Jack leave me? 
You asked him to. 
You told me he was too removed. 
There was no connection between you two any more. 
How about you and l? 
 l thought there was one. 
 But, what, l didn't? 
Truth is, l think you did. 
But you were scared. 
You didn't wanna lose your family. 
And when Jack asked to move back in, you let him. 
 lt's funny. 
 What? 
l don't remember you at all. 
But being with you makes me feel good, and... maybe l don't feel so scared. 
Thank you for doing this, Phil. 
Did Chuck come through? 
l hope not. Just park in the back. 
 Just sit tight. 
 l can't stay here. l need to find my mom. 
 l don't know how to get you outta here. 
 l'll make a run for it. 
l wouldn't. Frank's a psycho. 
You don't wanna cross him. 
 l'm gonna go. 
 No. 
(knock on door) Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no. 
Get in the kitchen. 
Come on in, man. 
You, be careful. 
No, he's cool. Come on. lt's all right. 
Let's see it. 
Yeah. 
 That's what l'm talking about. 
 These the guys with the ecstasy? 
 No, these are just friends of mine. 
 Frank, what are you gonna do? 
What does it look like? 
We can't pay if we don't have any money. 
 You're gonna rip 'em off? 
 Yeah. 
(gun clicks)  Thank you. 
 Mmhm. 
 You all right, honey? 
 l'm absolutely fine, Daddy. 
 Good. 
 Go ahead. They're waiting for you. 
OK. l'm gonna head down now. 
This is a test for us. 
lf we love each other, support each other... 
nothing else will matter. 
Sherry? 
l need you now more than ever. 
l've always liked this tie on you, David. 
Senator? lt's time. 
Anything look familiar? 
lt's so weird. Looking at what l did for the last 
few months, it doesn't mean anything to me. 
''Yvonne's birthday.'' 
''Kim in Cambria for the weekend.'' 
''Dinner with Phil. lvy at the Shore.'' 
Was it nice? 
Well, the wait was over an hour, so... 
we decided to walk down the pier and have some hot dogs. 
And you beat me at air hockey. 
Air hockey, huh? 
What's in there for today? 
Nothing. Although yesterday l had 
a conference call with Kitty, whoever that is. 
Kitty - she's a friend of yours. 
You work with her sometimes. 
You do commercial interior design. 
lt's just freelance right now, but you wanna expand when Kim goes off to college. 
How come l can sort of remember air hockey but l can't remember what l do for a living? 
(doorbell rings)  Maybe that's Jack. 
 He wouldn't ring the bell. 
lt's probably my friend Chris. Remember? l 
wanted someone here, to be on the safe side. 
 Yeah. 
 Stay here, just in case. 
 (man) Hey, Phil. 
 (Phil) Hey, Chris. Thanks for coming. 
 Teri, this is Chris. 
 Hi. 
 Why does he have a gun? 
 He's here to... 
l don't care. Get him 
outta the house with that gun. 
Chris, will you just give us a couple of minutes, OK? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 Teri, Chris is a friend of mine... 
 That doesn't mean anything to me. 
l don't know who you are. l don't know 
who he is. l don't want any guns. 
OK. l'll tell him to stay outside. ls that OK? 
But we need him here, just in case. 
Teri, your husband could have been the one who roughed you up. 
l want you safe. 
Teri, look at me. 
Look at me. 
l'm your friend. 
You trust me. You told me so yourself. 
So you're gonna have to trust my judgment. 
OK. 
 (Andre) What's going on over there? 
 The wife is here. 
 The daughter? 
 No. 
 What are you waiting for? 
 There's a little interference. 
But it'll pass soon. Didyou findAlexis? 
Not yet. 
 Call me when it's done. 
 Yes. 
(woman) Ladies and gentlemen of the press, if you will please take your seats now. 
Senator Palmer is just about here. 
We will begin. 
(man) Senator Palmer? 
Last night l received a phone call regarding my son, Keith, and my daughter, Nicole. 
That call has unfortunately set offa chain ofevents that has culminated in a tragedy. 
Whether or not what l have to say jeopardises my campaign is for the voters to decide. 
l'm doing this for my family. 
A large portion ofthe financial support for my campaign comes from a group ofbusinessmen right here in Los Angeles. 
 Every presidential campaign relies on... 
 l'll take care of it. 
Too late, Carl. 
l have apparently misjudged these local businessmen. 
More importantly, they have misjudged me. 
(Palmer) How it was acquired, l am not at liberty to say. 
l have already handed this incriminating tape over to the Justice Department. 
Whether or not it's admissible in court, it will still implicate the men who have been supporting my campaign. 
l'll emphasise again that these men acted without my consent or my knowledge. 
As for my son, Keith, he is prepared to turn himselfin and face any consequences a grandjury deems necessary. 
He is my son, and l love him. 
And l will stand by him. 
l am confident that when presented with the facts it will be clear that there was no criminal intent or wrongdoing. 
He will only be guilty ofnot reporting an accident. 
As for my daughter, Nicole, it is important for everyone to remember she was the victim of a horrible crime. 
A physical and psychological crime. 
She is not a source ofinformation. 
This is about the cover-up ofan accidental death. 
This is not about rape. 
So l'm asking you now, as a father, please find your humanity and spare Nicole the indignity of having to relive this nightmare. 
 (man) We lost track of both of 'em. 
 (Nina) How long have you known this? 
 Does Jack know about this? 
 Nina. Nina! 
 Not that l'm aware of. 
 Did you know the safe house was hit? 
 Relax, OK? 
 Tony, answer me! 
 Yes, l knew. 
 Why didn't you tell me?! 
Look, Mason didn't want you to know cos he didn't want you to tell Jack. 
His family is missing! He should know that. 
Yeah, l'm with you on this. 
Look, Mason gave the order, all right? 
He's deployed resources. 
He's called locals to help find 'em. 
You should have told me. You work for me. 
And you work for Mason. 
This is my fault. 
l should never have left Teri and Kim. 
Nina, you're not a field agent, all right? 
What could you have done? 
Jack needs to know about this. 
(phone rings)  Mason. 
 Have you told Jack about his family yet? 
 No, we're not there yet. 
 You can't do this. You have to tell him. 
 Uhhuh. 
 Let him know so he can help us find them. 
They're exposed. 
lf Drazen's people find them first... 
 That's a good idea. 
 Listen to me, George. 
lf anything happens to them he's gonna hold you responsible. Think about that. 
l will. OK, let me know 
if you have any progress. 
George! 
Nina... 
Jack, my battery just died. 
Can l use your phone for a sec? 
Yeah, sure. 
Thanks. 
(ringing tone) Yeah, it's me. No, all l wanna say is 
keep the backup units on stand-by, all right? 
(woman) The cellular customer you are trying to reach is unavailable. 
 OK. 
 l got a signal. 
 What'd Nina have to say? 
 She's just checking our location. 
What does GPS say? 
lt doesn't make sense. lt's saying 
the address is right up ahead. 
l know the whole thing was hush-hush, but who was Victor Drazen? 
Drazen was Milosevic's shadow. He was 
in charge of all of his covert operations. 
He was responsible for organising the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Kosovo, Sarajevo and Bosnia. 
 Your unit took him out? 
 That's right. 
 You rolled the whole deal up? 
 Yeah. 
So who'd have the kind of influence to run an operation like this against you and Palmer? 
My guess would be Serbian military exiles. 
They could pull this off. 
Alexis and Andre pulled together a cell without us knowing. 
lt's a hell of a cell to be able to infiltrate the CTU, turn Jamey. 
l agree. lt's hard to believe Jamey could work 
against us without some kind of umbrella. 
Any ideas why the Serbs would wanna spend this much money to turn the power off in the middle of the woods? 
No. 
George, look. A power transformer. 
The lock on it's new. 
Why would this be designated as a wildlife sanctuary? Think about it. 
There's no water. No water, no wetlands. 
No wetlands, no birds, no animals... 
No nothing, as far as l can make out. 
(knock on door) Here they are, man. Let's get ready. 
Right on time. l like that. 
 Who the hell's this? 
 Just some friends of mine. lt's cool. 
How you know Frankie? 
l'm a friend of Rick's. 
Who's Rick? 
 l am. 
 Ah. And what happened to you? 
We gonna play twenty questions or do business? 
l just wanna know who's in the room. 
You got a problem with that? 
No, man. Knock yourself out. Get a medical 
history, take a urine sample for all l care. 
Let's just get on with it. Come on. 
 Fine. Let's do this. Got the cash, Frankie? 
 l got what you need. Let's see the E first. 
OK. 
Pure MDMA. No caffeine. Wanna check it? 
No, man. l trust you. 
All right, homey. Where's the money? 
Did you hear that? 
This guy called me ''homey''. 
l got your money. 
lt's right here. 
Stand down! 
Come on, homey. 
Stand down or you're eating one. 
You pull that trigger, you're going down too. 
Let's just do 'em! Let's do 'em. 
All right. 
Everybody chill out, man. lt's all cool. 
We're gonna put the guns down. 
On the ground. Nice and easy. 
 lt's going down. 
 Let's go. See what else they got on 'em. 
Get down. 
All this cos you couldn't keep my brother alive. 
They might not have registered with their real names. 
No, just use the description that we sent you, OK? 
 You checking the hospitals? 
 Yes. 
l don't understand how Teri and Kim just disappeared. 
Well, it might be a good thing. lf Drazen's 
people had them, we'd have heard about it. 
After all, Jack and Palmer are the primary targets. 
 What about Jack's house? 
 l sent Williams over, but l'll check on him. 
 And Kim's phone call? 
 A phone booth. We're checking the area. 
Look, Nina, we're doing everything we can, right? 
Are you? 
What you gonna do now, man? Kill us? 
Yeah. 
l'll kill you... 
if l ever see you again. 
You should get that stitched, man. 
 How's that for a nose job? 
 Pretty good. l like it. 
 Hey, Frankie? 
 What's that, homey? 
Speak up. 
You have the right to remain silent. 
Everybody freeze! 
(shouting)  Arrest all of 'em. 
 Please, don't do this. We didn't do anything. 
 We're not a part of this! 
 Arms up! 
Up against the wall. 
Let me have your Handie. 
This is Krugman. We got a code four. 
One suspect down, five being booked. 
l think l got a broken nose. 
Look, l'll say it again. l bear 
full responsibility for not knowing about it. 
A senator's duty, a president's duty, an elected representative's duty, is not only to his country but also to his family. 
lf he cannot manage the interactions of the people close to him, then he can't expect the electorate to believe in his abilities to lead a nation. 
l don't deny l made a mistake. 
A serious one. 
l only ask you to consider that l am not the first person in public office to make one. 
Thank you. 
l love you, Dad. 
l love you, son. 
This is Emily. She's eleven. 
And this is Jennifer. She just turned nine. 
 And l didn't meet them? 
 No. 
We decided to leave everyone outside of it until you were sure what you wanted. 
 (kettle whistles)  l'll get it. 
She made this for me. 
(Phil) You want milk or sugar in it? 
Yeah. 
 Phil, l think l'm remembering something. 
 Really? l'll be right there. 
 Rest room? 
 Right down the hall. 
Teri! 
Where's the girl? 
Your daughter. Where is she? 
l... l don't know! 
Tell me where she is and l'll make this painless for both of you, l promise. 
l... l don't know. 
Fine. 
(gunshots) (Teri) Oh, God! 
Teri, step away. 
Move away, Teri. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Teri, step away, please! 
The car... Oh, my God, the car... 
(sobs hysterically) l lost Kimberly! 
(Tony) Teri, it's OK. You're safe. 
l lost Kimberly! 
GPS says this is it. 
Yeah, right. 
What's that? Reconnaissance? 
Someone knows we're here. 
God knows what you did to Terry's father. 
David Burke was ready to make his change. 
We're gonna take you to the hospital. 
 They can take better care of you. 
 No! 
How could he do this to you? 
It's not that your father doesn't see. 
It's that he can't. 
 Maybe Christina can help. 
 No. 
She's changing. 
I think we're losing her. 
You have to understand. The things 
that you've been saying lately, you sound  I want to hear you say it. 
 Crazy. 
 Get out! 
 My mom's really not supposed to see anyone right now. 
 Let me talk to the doctors. 
 No! 
This is a family thing now. 
Let us deal with it. 
What you'll do to them will be quick and painless. 
What they'll do to each other, if you let them live- ohh. 
This world is a sick dog that needs to be put down. 
Five people have vanished. 
Is there anything you can tell me? 
I'd like to be more helpful, Chief, but I can't betray my vows. 
Morals are the very foundation of the church. 
If my wife turns up dead, I'll come show you my morals. 
 What do you see? 
 You're him. 
Make the kind of deal he made. 
With me by your side... 
 you'll be unstoppable. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Let me tell you a story. 
 Mom? 
Tell her, Anne. 
Tell her, or I will. 
I'm here to kill the child of the beast. 
I'll do what you want, but on my terms. 
Fair enough. But we kill Christina tonight. 
Can you do what needs to be done? 
It's starting. 
This is a family thing. 
Still a doubter, Daddy? 
 Look, Chris  Can we not have another big talk? 
I'm so over the heartfelt download. 
 Whatever happened, we can help you. 
 I'm over it. 
Okay? Just want to have 
a nice quiet family dinner. 
 Is that too much to ask? 
 What the hell is goin' on? 
Dinner. Now. 
 Just do what she says, Ben. 
 Your wife's got the right idea. 
Again. 
You should try listening to her. 
Although it's a little late for that, isn't it? 
You guys don't have to look so scared. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
Not unless you make me angry. 
 What are we waiting for? 
 They'll tell us when they have Christina. 
 You're not getting cold feet, are you? 
 No. I'm ready. 
Jess, I'm really proud of you for accepting this responsibility. 
No matter what happens, I'm always here for you. 
You know that, right? 
I had Christina. 
She was lowering her guard. 
 Oh, Boyd. 
 Yeah. He survived. 
 Then he has Christina. 
 No. She ran. And she's growing 
more powerful by the second. 
I'm sorry. Who is she? 
This doesn't concern you. 
Anne, you're Christina's mother. 
I don't think that. 
Not anymore. 
You were the trap. 
That's how you were gonna do it? 
Get her mother to tuck her in for the first time in her life, then send me in for the kill? 
 We had to use every advantage to stop her. 
 But it backfired, didn't it? 
 That's why it's more important now that you get to her, Jesse. 
 Sarah's right. 
Jesse, you have to prepare. 
Go to the sanctuary. Clear your mind. 
As soon as we find her, you're going in. 
And that's the ugly truth. 
Buck up, kid. 
Nothing's changed. 
 Except you knowing you're in the big leagues now. 
 Nothing's changed? 
Everything's changed. 
Really? 
Tell me. 
All you've done for Boyd and where you are now... 
would you take it back? 
Yeah. Okay. 
I knew Mr. Boyd's 
business was shady, but... 
I didn't sign up for this. 
It doesn't matter how big or small the game is. 
You just did what it takes to survive. 
Well, I'm through. 
 People are dying. 
 Baby, it is raining death around here. 
Look, the endgame is coming up fast, and we all have to choose sides. 
The question now is, do you want to just survive? 
Or do you want to win? 
My money's on you. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, you better know. 
Real fast. 
Terry. 
 What was that about? 
 I scared him off. 
Spooky me. 
Well, someone's awfully perky. 
Christina's gonna take apart the Kramer's. 
And I'll be damned if I don't get a ringside seat. 
 I want us to pack up fast. 
 Where are we goin'? 
If everything goes down the way I think it's gonna... 
there won't be a Point Pleasant when the night is over. 
We'll hit the city. 
Christina will take over daddy's corporation. 
A lot of damage can be done with those kind of resources. 
And you'll be right there with her. 
We will. 
As long as Team Vatican doesn't get to her. 
Look, she was born to do this. 
You have nothing to worry about. 
I've worked too hard and too long not to see this through. 
Christina needs to take down Jesse once and for all. 
Be ready to go. 
 To the future. 
 Or lack thereof. 
I wanted to tell him. 
I've hidden so many things. 
To keep him safe. 
 He'll hate me for this. 
 You can't tell him. 
If he knows of your sacrifice, it'll only weaken him. 
Sarah. 
And you are you ready for this? 
We showed you the prophecy. 
The seven must die willingly. 
Bless the killing blow. 
I know my part in this. 
This looks so good, Mom. 
Thanks. 
Judy, you want to lead grace? 
Say grace. 
Judy. 
Bless this food, Father. 
Thank you for our many blessings. 
 Amen. 
 Good. Eat. 
I don't mean to be so bossy. 
I just really need you guys right now. 
It's been a tough couple of days. 
I guess we should get a few things out there for Dad's benefit. 
Ben, my birth parents. 
Dad is the devil, and it turns out Mom's a bitch. 
 What is she  Christina, please. What happened? 
 I met her. Anne. 
 It didn't go well. 
Understatement. 
Pass the bread. 
There are these guys from the Vatican soldiers or something. 
They're here to kill me. 
Anne's here to help 'em do it. 
 Christina, I am so  Sorry? Me too. 
She was my final hope, right? 
 To keep from going all Antichristy. 
 Oh, this is insane. 
 You still have hope. 
 I don't know. 
I think I've been just a little too focused on the whole good versus evil thing. 
I mean, ultimately, it's just about getting what you want, right? 
 Elbows. 
 What? 
Your elbows are on the table. 
 Oh. 
 I've been thinking a lot about it, and... 
we don't call animals evil, and they take what they want. 
 Kill. 
 But you're not an animal. 
Sure I am. 
We all are. 
Right, Dad? 
 I'm not your father. 
 Dad. 
 I don't know what you are, but I didn't make you. 
 What? 
I want you out of this house right now. 
 Ben, please. 
 I don't think that's what Meg wants. 
 Or what Judy wants, is it? 
 Uhuh. 
 No. Of course not. 
 See? 
You think you understand. 
 I do. I understand fine. 
 You don't. 
You have no idea. 
You've been completely oblivious to what your family's been going through. 
I knew something was wrong when you walked through that door. I knew! 
I'm not the problem here! 
It's you. 
You've been blind. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Dad! 
Blind as a bat. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
Ben, honey. 
We're going to put this on your eyes. 
Ow. 
You can undo this. 
Please. 
It seems harsh. I know. 
But it's gonna be good for him. 
For all of you. 
He'll learn how to listen. 
No. 
You've taught him his lesson. He gets it. 
I'm telling you. 
It's for the best. 
Okay. Christina, why don't 
you and I go clear the dishes? 
I want dessert. 
 I'm here, Daddy. 
 Oh, good. 
I'm sorry. I didn't 
mean to scare you. 
You did. 
 But I know that you don't want to hurt us. 
 I don't. 
I really don't. 
Ben shouldn't have spoken to you like that. 
He knows that. 
But can't you help him? 
Please. 
I'll stop the pain. 
But he stays blind. 
Oh, for the love of Holly! 
F Damn it. 
Oh, damn it. 
She wanted to be alone. 
She said she needed to concentrate. 
 We shouldn't have left him alone with her. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
She made me leave. 
She's gonna kill us, isn't she? 
No. It's not over. 
Other people know what's happening, and they're trying to help us. 
 What other people? 
 I'm not the only one who can see, Judy. 
We're not alone. 
 Mr. Burke. 
 How they treating you, Jess? 
You need to be in bed. 
No. I thought 
I was sick dying but I was just changing into something else. 
Why he picked a wreck like me to deliver the message, I'll never know. 
Maybe he does favor the meek after all. 
 Mr. Burke. 
 They're wrong, Jesse. 
Those guys with their books. 
They've made it all so complicated... 
when it should be so simple. 
Thou shalt not kill. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Jesse. 
Are you all right? 
Do you need anything? 
No. I'm 
I'm okay. 
Chief, do you copy? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry to disturb you, sir. 
 Is it my wife? Is she okay? 
 No, sir. That's not it. 
Some residents from Magnolia Street called this morning. Mr. and Mrs. Jensen. 
It's like the others. 
They just disappeared. 
 That's seven people in two days. 
 Get this. 
The Jensens met with their attorney this morning, revising their will. 
They're leaving their entire estate to St. Martin's. 
I'll handle this. 
All right? 
Stale cookies for the Antichrist. 
Think that's gonna fly? 
It's all we've got, and she's not  Well, not yet. 
 Yeah. When she's totally gone, she'll eat our... 
heads on a stick. 
I- I really thought that I was so stupid. 
I really cared about her. 
You weren't stupid, honey. 
Caring about Christina was the only choice you had. 
It's the only choice any of us have if we want to survive. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
We gotta get out of here. 
We have to run. You know, I say we grab Dad 
when she's not looking, and we bail. 
 Judy  Cut the platitudes, Mom. 
Okay? We're stuck 
in a house with a psycho. 
Ben's ready to come downstairs. 
He's feeling better. 
 Mom. 
 Let me handle this. 
Holly! 
Holly! 
You ungrateful She didn't mean it. 
This isn't gonna work, Meg. 
It's okay to call me Mom. 
 We're family. You know that. 
 Step. 
It's okay. Step. 
I always wished I had a sister. 
But I'm not gonna beg Judy to like me. 
She's scared, Christina, but she loves you. 
 Really? 
 Like I do. 
We just want you to come back to us the way you were. 
It's Jesse. Leave a message. 
It's Judy. 
She's in the house. 
I sure as hell hope you do know how to kill her, Jesse. 
Tell him I said hi. 
I can't believe you called him. 
 Christina, I'm I'm sorry. 
 She wasn't trying to Let us finish. 
I tried with you. 
I really have. 
But you fought it from the beginning. 
 What? I fought what? 
 Me! 
You were jealous. 
I had a connection. 
 Meg loved me. 
 No. 
What you did for her I was grateful. 
Hardly. 
 When Isabelle died, you were glad. Got to be the only one. 
 No. 
 Your heart wasn't in it when you asked me to bring her back. 
 Oh, my God! 
Don't you think I would have begged you if I didn't think... 
 she was gonna come back as some sort of thing? 
 You didn't want competition. 
 Christina, stop. 
 That's not true. 
God, if you were a person, you'd see how much I miss her... 
how much I want her to be here. 
Are you sure about that? 
You have to use this blade, and you must not waver. 
She may try to trick you maybe even play on your love. 
I won't let her get to me. 
I swear. 
These cookies are stale. 
Isabelle won't mind. 
So is she. 
Now... 
if I were a person... 
I might feel bad for doing this, but I don't. 
You know why? 
 'Cause you don't listen. 
 What do you want from us? 
What he means is how can we help you? 
You need to stop asking that. 
Don't you get it? 
Get what? 
I'm here to help you. 
Somebody's here. 
Paula? 
 How did you get in here? 
 Where's Paula? I need to talk to her. 
 If you think I am letting you near her, you're crazy. Get out. 
 It's important. 
You may have Paula fooled into thinking that you love her, but I don't trust you. 
 I don't trust anyone that works for Lucas Boyd. 
 Fine. 
 Just hear me out, and you'll never have to see me again. 
 I'm listening. 
Leave Point Pleasant. Now. 
 Boyd put you up to this? 
 No. 
Look, there's a reason why Boyd became friends with both of us. 
We didn't have far to fall. 
 You don't know me. 
 Paula talks. 
Deep down you know what's happening here. 
That's why you stopped talking to Boyd. 
That's why you don't want me with Paula. 
I know you want to protect her. 
Okay. So, what? Just run away 
and pretend like we never had a life here? 
You won't have one if you stay. 
Oh! 
Cute. Cute. 
Sealed the place up. 
 Smart. 
 I don't like surprise visitors. 
You're late. 
I would have been here sooner, but I had to put out a fire. 
 Logan. 
 Sarah. 
Oh, isn't this a domestic scene. 
Aren't you gonna introduce me to the new arrival? 
Don't gloat. 
This has nothing to do with you. 
I should have listened to you both of you. 
We're going to get through this. 
Talk. Jesse'll be here soon. 
Excellent. Are you ready? 
I'm looking forward to it. 
When it's over, it's time to go. 
 We have bigger things to attend to. 
 Not yet. 
I'm not done here. 
People don't know how to act, what's good for them. 
 They need to be trained. 
 How's it goin'? 
 It'll take some time. 
 You see? That's just it. 
You don't have enough time. 
You'll never get that dog to heel. 
Burn it down, Christina the house, the town. 
This world was an experiment, and it failed. 
Your dad sees that. 
And so do you. 
Let it end. 
It's Jesse. 
Oh. What's that look? Oh, don't tell me 
you still have a soft spot. 
 You know why he came here. 
 I'm ready. 
 I want him to hurt. 
 But do you want him to die? 
Aaah! 
You should have tried the balcony, Romeo. 
Chris would do this herself, but... 
she's feeling a little fragile. 
You too, it seems. 
Didn't anybody ever tell you not to play with hammers? 
 What are you doing? 
 Grab everything you can. We're leaving town. 
What? Are you 
out of your mind? 
I mean it, Paula. 
We can't stay here. 
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me why. 
Terry told us to leave town. 
Something horrible is gonna happen in Point Pleasant... 
and you don't want to be here when it does. 
We're moving so I won't see Terry anymore. 
Even for you, that's insane. 
You can't have your own relationship... 
 so you have to destroy  No. It's not about us! 
It is not safe here. 
Now, I swear to you, Paula. 
That is the truth. 
No. 
If it was, Terry would talk to me, not you. 
Okay. Fine. 
If you need to hear it from him  Hello? 
 Hey, Terry. 
My mom's flipping out. 
Um, did you tell us to leave town? 
Yeah, I did. 
And you should. 
 What? Why? 
 Do it. Go. 
 I'm not going anywhere until I can see you and you explain  I'm done with you, okay? 
The whole thing was hotter when you were Jesse's girl. 
Listen to your mom. Get out of here. 
You're okay. 
What is going on? 
There were other people here. 
They're getting ready. 
 I should be too. I don't have much time. 
 What? I don't 
I don't understand. Sarah, 
do you have any idea how worried I've been? 
The other people-They're the ones that have been missing around town, aren't they? 
Irwin Brewster, Victor Garby. Why? 
Why not let people know that they're okay? 
We didn't want anyone to try and stop us. 
The seven of us have been called to sacrifice ourselves tonight. 
 What? 
 Jesse is on his way to kill Christina Nickson. 
It's his destiny, Logan. 
It's why he died and came back. 
She is not human. 
She is... something evil. 
 Sarah, can you hear yourself? 
 I know how this must sound to you. 
You have to listen to me. 
We don't have time. 
When he kills her, our souls will be there, ready to take hers to heaven. 
Sarah, you-you can't believe this stuff. 
It's what I have to do. 
You are the love of my life, Logan. 
I hope you believe that. 
And Jesse couldn't have asked for a better father. 
All right. Just stop. 
Listen to me. 
This is a death cult. 
Do you understand? 
 Somebody has sold you a pack of lies. 
 No. 
Someday I hope you understand I did this for you. 
Sarah. 
Sarah.! 
Sarah! 
 Oh, great. 
 Boyd? 
Boyd. 
You shouldn't be able to get in here unless I want you to. 
 Maybe you do. 
 Interesting. 
I'm over my death wish, so that's not it. 
Maybe I wanted a booty call. 
Last time was good for me. 
 I mean, obvious problems toward the end. 
 Christina... 
you wanted me to come in because you want help. 
You're not gonna be any fun, are you? 
Christina, don't.! 
Know why he's here? 
Yes, I do. 
And you both need to stop. 
He's here to use this on me. 
No! 
Stay out of it. 
This is gonna be a short date. 
Maybe not. 
You make me stronger. 
Remember? 
Sarah! 
You must have broken Boyd up real good. 
 He won't be coming to help you. 
 He won't need to. 
Christina! Jesse! Please listen! 
Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not And you shall be cleansed of all your stains, sayeth the Lord. 
 Lord, have mercy. 
 Lord, have mercy. 
Lead us not into temptation. 
But deliver us from evil. 
Lord, heed my prayer. 
Let my cry be heard by him. 
The Lord be with you. 
And also with you. 
Christina, you're in there. I know it. 
"In there"? 
This is me. 
That whiny wimp of a girl she's the one who should be buried. 
 "I don't want to hurt anybody. 
Where's my mommy?" 
 No. Listen. 
 I don't want to kill you. 
 And I don't want to kill you. 
Oh, wait. Actually, I do. 
I swear. 
That's not why I'm here. 
You know, the big brown eyes say sincere... 
but the knife in your hand is throwing me. 
I had to play along, make 'em think I was with them. 
Everybody you cared about has hurt you, abandoned you. 
And I did too. And I'm sorry. 
But I won't do it again. 
Do you honestly expect me to buy this? 
You ran away. 
You left me! 
I got scared. 
I saw what might happen, but it doesn't have to end like that. 
I need you to beat this, Christina. 
 And I'm not the only one. 
You can bring such hope. 
 To who? 
People are too stupid to fix themselves. 
It's too late. 
Dear God in heaven, I entreat you, blessed our Father... 
to guide these souls to safety as they enter the gates of heaven... 
and deliver unto you the spirit of Satan's progeny... 
through Christ, our Lord. 
Amen. 
I know who you are. 
You can change things. We can 
You're wrong. 
You're just muscle. 
Dumb muscle. 
Then kill me. 
Go ahead. 
Kill me. 
'Cause if you're gone, I don't want to be here. 
I love you, Christina. 
Yes. That's right. 
 That's right. 
 What? 
Don't say that. 
I do. 
Don't. 
Then do it. 
Jesse. 
Jesse. 
Jesse. 
In the name of the Father, and of the Son... 
and of the Holy Spirit. 
Spiritus Sancti. 
Amen. 
Help him. 
And I had such a crush on you. 
You got me. 
And I had you pegged for a terrible liar. 
I meant it that I love you. 
 So much you had to gut me? 
 To save you from what you'll do. 
Christina. Jesse. 
What's happening? 
I think it's time for the lifeguard to see some people die. 
 No. 
 Everybody drop the knives. 
Drop 'em. 
 Step back. 
 You don't understand. 
Jesse! 
 Mom, don't. 
 What did you do? 
 I did what they told me to. 
 No. 
They told you this would work? 
The God guys? 
They need some new leadership. 
God has nothing to do with them. 
He sent you a message. 
Through David Burke. 
That was real. Not the church. 
What was he supposed to do? 
Love her? 
I mean, look at her. She's gone. 
 Hi. Standing right here. 
 No, you're not. 
You're the thing that took Christina, my friend. 
You know what? If you're gonna hurt us, 
just do it. Because I'm sick of being scared. 
No. 
No! 
 Jesse.! 
 Jesse! 
I'm sorry. 
Oh, my God. 
Boyd was right. 
Let's get this thing over with. 
Please! You can stop this. 
Someone took his "get out of death free" card. 
Bye, Mom. 
Bye, Sis. 
Ben! Ben! 
 Isabelle. 
 Daddy. 
I can see you. 
The shaking. 
What does it mean? 
It means we failed. 
Christina. 
You did it, baby. 
I could feel his death rattle from here. 
Oh, well, he he busted me up all right. 
Help me, would ya? 
Come on. 
Come on. We can be 
in Manhattan by breakfast. 
It's over, Chris. 
We won. 
No. 
I won. 
That's my girl. 
We lost her. 
 It's over. 
 Not yet. 
Not as long as we're still alive. 
It's not over. 
We have to go after Christina, and if we save her, we can save ourselves. 
And if we can't save her... 
we kill the bitch. 
The city. 
Take the long way. 
I want to enjoy the sights. 
Yes, sir. It's the dawn 
of a whole new day. 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life. 
 You just gave your concession speech. 
 (David) That remains to be seen. 
l only hope your conscience comforts you when you finally realise this is all over. 
You mean the campaign or us? 
l saw the car explode. l lost my daughter! 
Kim is alive. She got out 
before the explosion. l talked to her. 
(cop) l'm gonna stick you back in the holding cell. 
Maybe that'll convince you not to screw around. 
Call this number. Tell them that l am 
Jack Bauer's daughter and that l'm here. 
Ask them if they think l'm screwing around. 
This is a prison facility. Why are you here? 
The people that want Palmer dead bribed someone from the power company. 
Something's gonna happen here. 
A prisoner's being delivered by chopper. 
His identity's classified, even from me. 
 That's impossible. 
 (DeSalvo) You recognise him? 
That's Victor Drazen, the man l killed two years ago. 
 You haven't heard from your brother? 
 You seem anxious, Harris. 
Just getyour men ready. lt's time. 
The idea is to get my father out of prison. 
This is the best chance we'll ever have. 
Get against the wall. 
They are here. 
Well, it's official. The polls havejust 
closed in California, and the big story: Senator David Palmer seems to have swept California and every other state that held a primary this Super Tuesday. 
lt looks like he may have gotten a late boost based on the roller-coaster events of his day. 
Earlier, the senator held a press conference to disclose the details of a scandal involving both his son and his primary financial backers. 
Palmer claims to have been unaware of any wrongdoing... 
You're in my seat. 
Fine. 
l said, that's my seat. 
 (David) And how about you? 
 Would you excuse us for a moment? 
(David) Thanks a lot. 
11 for 11, my friend. 
Congratulations. You did it. 
We did it. 
That's not the best part. 
Fox News just did an instant poll. 
83 per cent approved of the way you handled the Ferragamo situation. 
Boy, that is great! 
 Have we heard from Ames or his people? 
 They're all too busy running for cover. 
We don't wanna get cocky, but so far it couldn't have turned out better. 
Everyone, listen up. 
ln a bit, l'm going to give a speech to the country. 
We have a number of primaries in the coming months, so technically it's not a victory speech. 
But l'm gonna make it sound like one anyway. 
(cheering) Now, as you know, in many ways this has been a difficult day for my family. 
And l am confident that being open and honest was the right thing to do, and that things will be resolved fairly for everyone concerned. 
And, in the meantime, l wanna thank everyone in this room for their support. 
 This is our victory. 
 (all) Yeah! 
 This is our night. 
 (all) Yeah! 
And l just wanna give one last order, which will be obeyed with no exceptions whatsoever. 
 Enjoy the rest of the evening. 
 (all cheer) Division wants an update on the Palmer threat assessment. 
With Alexis under control, that threat may be minimal. 
Nina, it's your line. 
 Go ahead. 
 Do what you can to get everyone together. 
 lt's Bauer. 
 l got it. 
 What the hell's goin' on? 
 Listen up. 
The field we were standing in is hiding an underground detention facility. 
lt's being used as a prison to house Victor Drazen. 
You said you took him out two years ago. 
Apparently not. l'm staring at him. There's 
a team in place. They're ready to attack us. 
They've already cut off the power. 
l need you to send in a field unit now! 
 George, what are you gonna do? 
 All right, l'll call Division. 
By the time you get approval, this whole thing'll be over. 
lf Victor Drazen escapes, it'll be our fault. 
George, you know what this man can do. 
(banging) You decide. 
What's going on? 
Dispatch a field unit to the location in Saugus. l'll clear it from my end. 
 Get ahold of Chapelle immediately. 
 What is going on? ls Jack all right? 
lt is such a shame. You're wasting 
the best years of your life on a married man. 
 George... 
 And picking up Almeida on the rebound? 
 That is out of line. 
 No, you're outta line. Think about it. 
l'm just tryin' to be a friend here. 
 George, just tell me if he's... 
 Nina, where's Jack? 
Teri, thank God you're OK. 
 Any word on Kim? 
 No, not yet. But we're working on it. 
 l need to talk to Jack. 
 He's not here. He's on assignment. 
On assignment? 
Has he been told what happened to us? 
 Well, not yet. 
 Why not? 
 Because we can't get ahold of him. 
 Get ahold of him now. 
 Teri, l'm sorry. lt's just not possible. 
 Nina, l want to talk to Jack. 
Jack's in a situation where he needs our support. We're doing everything we can. 
 What kind of situation? 
 That's all l can tell you right now. 
l need you to tell me everything that happened at your house before Tony arrived. 
l already told Tony everything. 
But it won't hurt to go over it again. Any 
details will help us, and they will help Jack. 
All right, but l need to know what's going on with my family. 
l know, and l promise l'll give you an update as soon as l have one. 
All right? 
Stand against the door. 
Lawrence, what's goin' on out there? 
Lawrence, do you copy? 
Ray, this is DeSalvo. Come in. 
 Ray! 
 We gotta get out of here. Which way? 
The flood egress is to the right. 
Open the door slowly. 
(Jack) Step out into the middle of the hall. 
Turn to your right. 
Keep moving. 
Lawrence, where are you? 
Lawrence, do you copy? 
We have to get out of this hallway. 
We're too exposed. 
All right. What's the plan? 
How are they gonna break you outta here? 
You son of a bitch, if any of my men die... 
What area of this building is most defendable? 
 (Jack) Let's get outta here. Move. 
 Fall back. Defend the retreat. 
(Jack) Turn around. 
l've been trying to get ahold of Chapelle. 
Whatever he's doing, this is more important. 
Well, for starters, l sent a CTU field unit over to a DOD facility. 
 l need to have some unity of command. 
 l can give him a message. 
All right. Just get him 
to call me as soon as you can. 
Mrs Bauer. 
 Teri. 
 Mason. l thought you were being debriefed. 
Nina won't tell me anything, and l need to know what's going on with Kim. 
l'm afraid l don't know any more than Nina does, but l'm sure Kim's safe. 
Well, l wish l could believe that, but... 
Based on what? 
l haven't been fully briefed, but the man that attacked you asked where she was, right? 
 Yes. 
 So that means they're lookin' for her, too. 
As time passes it gets harder for them and easier for us. 
There's only a few of them, whereas we can cover the whole city. And believe me, we are. 
Jack is extremely important to all of us here, and nobody's gonna rest easy until your daughter's back with you, safe and sound. 
Thank you. 
 Just doin' my job. 
 (phone rings)  Mason? 
 George, it's Nina. 
Uh-huh? 
Our unit will be on site in 15 minutes. They 
wanna know who's in command, us or DOD. 
 We are. Let me know when they're on site. 
 All right. 
Was that about Jack? 
We got a lot of things goin' on. As soon as 
we get word from Jack, we'll let you know. 
You've been very kind. 
l'll have my assistant Rebecca look after you. 
You let her know if you need anything, OK? 
Do me a favour, keep your chin up, all right? 
 Rebecca. 
 Yeah? 
l'm sending Jack's wife down. 
Baby-sit her for me. 
OK. What do you want me to do with her? 
Whatever. l don't care what you do with her. 
Just keep her out of my face, OK? 
Got it. 
 Where's Patty? 
 She's finishing up your speech. 
Hold that for me. l'll be right back. 
 Senator. 
 Congratulations. 
 Looks like you're going to the White House. 
 We'll know by the end of the day. 
 Hey, we missed you out there. 
 Hi. 
l'm just going through it one last time. 
l made the changes you asked for. 
Oh, yeah. That's much better. 
l'm glad you like it. 
l can't believe you won all 11 primaries. 
You and your family must be so happy. 
Yeah, we are. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. Yeah, it's just all catchin' up with me. 
lt's been a long day. 
You know what, Patty? Why don't we 
move the second paragraph to the end? 
That'll close with the note about party unity. 
That's a good idea. 
 Uh, Senator? 
 Yes, Patty? 
There's, um, something l've been wanting to tell you, but every time l start it just seems inappropriate. 
 What is it? 
 Well, it's just that, um... 
l wanted to tell you how much l admire you. 
l don't see very many people who stand by their principles the way that you do. 
And l truly believe our country would be a better place with you leading it. 
Well! 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. l'm just a little flustered. 
What a wonderful and unexpected compliment. 
Well, l'll just switch those paragraphs. 
All right. 
Barnes, this is Mason. What's your 20? 
We're approaching the site. 
What's going on down there? Barnes? 
Looks like the door's been blown in. 
 Are the hostiles inside? 
 They must be. 
No activity here. We're preparing to go in. 
(gunshots) (DeSalvo) Take cover! Take cover! 
 Father! 
 Andre! 
Get down or l'll shoot him! 
 (Harris) Let him go! 
 (Andre) Let my father go! 
Drop your weapons! 
 Stay back or l will shoot him! 
 You don't stand a chance! 
 Andre! 
 Drop it now. You're surrounded! 
Back off! Drop your weapons or l will shoot! 
Let my father go right now or this man dies. 
 Drop your weapons! 
 l'll kill him. 
Don't do it, Bauer! Don't release that prisoner. 
Drop your weapons or l will shoot him! 
Drop your weapons! 
 Don't do it, Bauer! 
 Drop it! l'll give you three seconds. 
One. 
Two. 
The weapon's up! 
No! 
 Father! 
 Andre! 
 (Victor) Where is Alexis? 
 He's been out of touch for some time. 
We have to assume the worst. 
(radio call in Serbian) (Harris speaks Serbian)  Hostiles outside the main entrance. 
 How many? 
At least a dozen, all well-armed. 
Collapse the corridor immediately. 
Let's hustle, men. Down here. Down here. 
Take him. We may need him 
as a bargaining chip. 
Go, go, go! 
(Harris speaks Serbian) That was a mistake. Now you're trapped. 
We will see. 
l told you, don't mess with me. 
You got something that belongs to me and you better give it up now. 
 (girl) l ain't got nothin'. 
 We cool. l'm your friend. 
We cool if you and your girls back off. 
You holdin' out on me? You a bad girl. 
When we get outta here, maybe l'll mess you up like that. 
 What is your problem? 
 You. 
Me? l'm only in here because 
you told the cops l was a part of the deal. 
 You were a part of the deal. 
 l didn't even know it was happening. 
Nobody told you to come over. 
 lf this is about Rick... 
 Rick? You think l care about that loser? 
 He's not a loser. 
 He kidnaps you, and you defend him? 
 He didn't know what was going on. 
 Like l said, he's a loser. 
What are you shaking your head for? 
You're Daddy's little girl. 
You get everything handed to you. 
Shut up! l have been listening 
to this crap all day. 
About how l get everything l want, and how my life is great and everyone else's sucks. 
Wanna know something? 
You don't know anything about me. 
Last night l was kidnapped, tied up in a trunk, and then l got to see your friend Dan get shot in the head. 
Take all the bad luck you've had, it wouldn't fit into half of what's happened to me today. 
So messing me up may not be as easy as you think. 
But if you wanna try, bring it on  here, outside, any place you like. 
(rattling) You think l am a monster because l want revenge on your wife and daughter as well as on you. 
You were a monster long before you ever heard of me. 
Oh, l see. You consider yourself informed. 
You have read magazines. 
You have studied intelligence reports, filed by people who tell their superiors only what they want to hear. 
And you have the audacity to judge me? 
When does your suffering end, Victor? 
After you've killed me and Senator Palmer and all the thousands of enemies you have? 
Yes. Simple, is it not? 
You're insane. lt's a psychotic fantasy. 
A fantasy which is coming closer and closer to a reality. 
This is Victor Drazen. 
Whom am l speaking to? 
This is George Mason. l'm the district 
director of the Counter Terrorist Unit. 
You will be the person l will be negotiating with? 
Negative. We do not negotiate with terrorists. 
l'm willing to listen to your concerns. 
My main concern is Jack Bauer. 
 Do you know him? 
 Yes, l know him. 
Do you want to see him alive again? 
How do l know he's alive? 
 George. 
 Yeah, it's me. 
l've counted six of them. 
They've got assault rifles. 
As you hear, he is alive. 
l'll be speaking with my superiors and l'll get back to you. 
Drazen's taken command of the facility. 
He's got Jack. There's at least six of them. 
They've got assault weapons, explosives. 
Get that information to the field unit. 
Bring up the layout of the facility. 
How did Jack sound? 
Alive. 
 lt's gonna be a long drawnout process. 
 l know the drill. 
And you know it may not turn out well. 
lf you want me to put somebody who's less emotionally involved on this, l will. 
l can do my job, George. 
OK. 
 Any word from Chapelle? 
 l still can't get ahold of him. 
Unbelievable. Hope that bastard doesn't 
plan on blaming me if things go wrong. 
 Take it. 
 No way. 
 l said take it. 
 No. 
Who's smokin' pot? 
 That one. 
 She threw it at me. 
Bitch! Why you lyin'? 
Give it to me. 
Give it to me! 
 And who are you? 
 l swear it wasn't me. 
Oh, you're comin' with me. 
She's telling the truth. 
 Don't make a liar outta me, blondie. 
 No need. You are one. 
l didn't do nothing! Get off me! 
l'm gonna get you back, blondie, don't you worry! 
(Melanie) Officer? 
Wait. 
l wanna talk to the cop who busted me today. 
l think his name is Krugman. 
 You wanna talk to him about what? 
 What happened tonight. 
He wants to know about it, so tell him that l'm ready to talk. 
Come on. 
Two years ago in Kosovo the man who went into the building before the explosion obviously wasn't you. 
 You were using a double. 
 A common technique. 
l am surprised your people were fooled by it. 
 That's not my point, Victor. 
 What is your point, Jack? 
You were using a double. 
That means you thought you were a target. 
When you let that man near your family, you put them in danger. 
You're responsible for their deaths. 
They were away on a trip. 
My daughter was ill. 
They returned one day earlier than expected. 
But, yes, l should have been more careful. 
Father, are you all right? 
Over the last two years l have accepted my share of responsibility for the death of my family. 
This is the day... 
you accept your share. 
(Andre) Come, Dada. 
Make sure he does not die. 
 (knock on door)  Come. 
ls this what you wanted? 
(phone rings) Mm-hm. Much better. 
 Senator? 
 Yeah, Elaine? 
 Mike says they're ready for you downstairs. 
 Tell him l'll be down in 20 minutes. 
 Do you have a copy for the TelePrompTer? 
 Uh, it's this one. 
All but the last page. 
OK. Thanks. 
Would you like to be left alone? 
No. You can work in here if you want. 
l'm sorry. 
What is it? 
lt's just that l feel bad that this day's been tainted for you. 
Don't feel bad for me. 
lt's Keith and Nicole who have been suffering. 
Excuse me for saying this, but you do that too much. 
 Do what? 
 You worry about everybody else. 
Who takes care of you? 
You all take care of me. 
No. We all want to, but planning 
schedules and writing speeches isn't taking care of someone. 
l'm fine, Patty. 
Just relax. 
You need this. 
Oh, that does feel good. 
l appreciate it, Patty. 
l really do. 
But if l get too comfortable, l may not get off this couch. 
Yeah, well, uh... 
l'll just go prepare tomorrow's briefing with Mike. Excuse me. 
(phone rings)  CTU. Myers. 
 (woman) Chapelle calling for Mason. 
Yes. l'll put you through. 
(phone rings)  Mason. 
 (woman) lt's Chapelle. 
Ryan, l've been tryin' to reach you for a half-hour. 
Yeah. Well, l've been getting 
reamed by DOD and the Pentagon. 
But l think l've managed to untangle the mess you've made. 
What are you talking about? 
You should have kept Bauer on a tighter leash, a lot tighter. 
 l'm not in love with the guy, but he delivers. 
 Oh, really? 
Let's face it, if it wasn't for Jack, Victor Drazen would have escaped, which would have been embarrassing for some, if l'm not mistaken. 
 You're very mistaken. 
 l beg your pardon? 
Come on, George. Think it through. 
Drazen wasn't officially a prisoner, right? 
So he couldn't officially escape. 
lt wouldn't have embarrassed anyone. 
lt would have been... 
 A nonevent. 
 Exactly. 
lnstead, we have an assault team out there with all kinds of people in the loop. 
Soon the cops'll get wind of it, and then, God forbid, the press. 
You wanna talk about embarrassing? 
Now, we have to end this thing. And 
l'm not talking hours, l'm talking minutes. 
What about Bauer? 
Nobody asked him to go out there tonight. 
Now, get on with it, or l'll find someone who will. 
 (phone rings)  Yeah? 
l'm gonna have to order a full assault, starting in about five minutes. 
Team's making their final preparations. 
l'm sorry. 
(phone rings) Teri, it's Tony. Can you pick up? 
 Hello? 
 Look, we've found Kim. 
She's fine. She's in a precinct. 
They're bringing her over. 
 Are you sure she's OK? Can l talk to her? 
 We'll put you through as soon as we can. 
OK. You patch her through 
as soon as she calls. 
 Thank you. 
 OK. 
 They found Kim. 
 They did? 
 Yeah. 
 That's great. 
l'm so relieved. 
Um... 
Teri, l have some information about Jack. 
Why don't you sit down? 
We think he may have been captured by the same group that was after you and Kim. 
Oh, my God! 
l know that sounds bad, but we have rescue teams on the site, and the people who have Jack have been completely surrounded. 
Teri... l know Jack. 
l know he will get out of this. 
l knew you'd want to be told. 
(radio) Team One is inside. 
Repeat: Team One is inside. 
Charges are in place.  
We are good to go. 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 This is it. 
 All right. 
 What about Bauer? 
Just make sure you get Drazen.  
Go. 
Hit it. 
Go! Go! 
Kimberly. 
 What is it? 
 We're releasing you. 
 Did you speak to my dad? 
 No, but l talked to the people he works with. 
Melanie told me she lied before. She admitted 
you had nothing to do with the drug deal. 
So l called the number you gave me, and everything checked out. 
 Sounds like you had a tough day. 
 Yeah. Did you speak to my mom? 
 She's waiting at CTU. 
 Are you serious? 
l'm serious.  
l'm gonna drive you there myself. 
 Ready? 
 l think so. 
 Would you do me a favour, David? 
 What's that, Mike? 
Smile. 
Not a politician's smile, a real one. 
You've been through hell today, but you've come through it. 
And tomorrow morning the fight starts again. 
But tonight you need to celebrate. 
l'll be fine, Mike. 
Let go of it, just for a little bit. 
l can't. 
This thing with Keith is just beginning. 
And as for Sherry and me? You've had a 
front-row seat today. You know it's not good. 
Let me explain something to you. 
Once you're in the White House, everything defers to the office. 
lt's what you need to do the job. 
lf it's your marriage that helps you... 
that's great. 
But if not... well, that's OK, too. 
You can have whatever you want, David. 
All right, Mike.  
Let's go. 
Report. 
(soldier) One dead body. 
No hostiles.  
Sector One secure. 
Sector Two secure. One dead body. 
Appears to be the warden - DeSalvo. 
No hostiles. 
Drake, this is Mason. 
What's goin' on down there? 
The entire staff, including the warden, is dead. 
But Drazen's gone, and so is anyone else who was here. 
Looks like they broke through another wall. 
Some sort of tunnel. 
 Maybe an old sewer system. 
 Follow them. 
Drake? 
Drake? 
lt's booby-trapped. Laser mines. 
 Can you disarm? 
 Given time. 
How much? 
About a half-hour. 
Do what you can. 
Get your hands back on your head. 
Well done. 
Father, we have less than three hours left. Get down. 
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. 
l will offer you one consolation. 
Your family will be joining you soon. 
Your son Alexis  do you wanna see him again? 
 Alexis is dead. 
 No, he's not. We've got him. 
You are lying. 
How else would l know that he was supposed to meet with one of Palmer's staff, a woman named Elizabeth Nash, in room 1243 at 4.30 this afternoon? 
 Yeah, that much is true. 
 We captured him. l know where he is. 
Get him in! 
 Can l borrow your phone? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Mom. lt's me. 
 Hi, honey. 
 Can't wait to see you. 
l can't wait to see you. 
l'm glad you're OK. l thought... 
l know. l thought they had you again. 
 How did you end up in jail? 
 l'll tell you when l get there. Where's Dad? 
He's not here. He's working. 
l'm hoping he'll call in very soon. 
l love you so much, Mom. And l'm 
gonna be there in a few minutes, OK? 
l love you too, honey. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
Thanks. 
 l'm real sorry about not believin' you at first. 
 Don't worry. Not sure if l believe it myself. 
Watch out!  
Argh! 
No! No! No! Get off me! 
No! Get off me! 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life. 
You must talk to Victor Drazen when he calls. 
Listen to his demands and cooperate. 
Senator, please answer this phone. 
 This is David Palmer. 
 Hello, Senator Palmer. 
Senator! 
We did it, Father. 
We did it. 
The man that planned the explosion needs to believe it was a success. 
You want the world to think that David is dead? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Absolutely not. 
 David, what's this all about? 
 His daughter is being held hostage. 
l'll take care of the girl. 
Then we can leave. 
Do not do anything until we know Jack Bauer is dead as well. Nothing. 
l was calling to confirm your death, but l see you've survived. 
l have an offer to make you. 
You've already killed Senator Palmer. 
l'm the last person on your list. 
 l'll make you a trade. Me for my daughter. 
 Come to Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A. 
(Kim) Do you mind if l have some coffee? 
(Andre) Stop right there, Kim! Don't move. 
(speaks Serbian) (phone rings) (in Serbian) (voices speaking Serbian) (phone rings) Maybe you're right. 
Maybe she drowned. 
lt does not matter, as long as Bauer believes his daughter is here. 
 (horn blares)  Stop! Stop, please! 
At this time, we do not have any information as to the cause of the explosion that killed Senator David Palmer. 
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? 
Since no one has seen a body, the media's circulating all kinds of rumours. 
Look, l will tell them as soon as l have confirmation that Bauer's daughter is safe. 
And then what, David? 
You're gonna play dead? 
And l'm supposed to hide in here and play the grieving widow? 
Just how long do you think we can keep that charade up? 
 For as long as we have to. 
 Well, that's crazy! lt's... 
Mike, tell him how crazy it is. 
He listens to you. 
 Don't put me in the middle of it. 
 lsn't that your job? To be in the middle? 
For crying out loud, Mike. 
lt's your career on the line too. 
OK. You came clean on TV today. 
You got lucky. 
But it could just as easily have gone the other way. 
Testing the public's patience like that? 
You won't be lucky again, David. 
Listen to me. 
Jack Bauer saved my life today. 
 Not once, but twice. 
 Yes, l realise that. 
 And l am sympathetic to what he's going... 
 l don't think you are. 
 David, l am. Listen to me. 
 No. l am going to respect his request. 
And so are you. 
You will not sacrifice his daughter. 
Anything new? 
 l'm going over the intel from Langley. 
 l mean about Jack. 
 CTU, Almeida. 
 l assume you still haven't heard from him? 
 (Tony) You sure? 
 No. Not yet. 
George? l got Highway Patrol on line seven. 
They picked up a girl at Port of Los Angeles. 
 Says she's Jack's daughter. 
 Patch it through. 
 This is Mason, CTU. Who am l speaking to? 
 Sergeant Devlin, Highway Patrol. 
 You have a young woman with you? 
 She claims to be the daughter of an agent. 
 Jack Bauer? 
 That's right. 
Can l speak with her, please? 
 Hello? 
 Kim, this is George Mason at CTU. 
 How are you? OK? 
 Yeah. You gotta tell my father l've escaped. 
 He'll go back there and they'll kill him. 
 Can you tell us where these people are? 
The port. l... l don't know exactly. 
 May l speak with the sergeant again? 
 OK. 
 Yeah. We picked her up near Dock 11 Alpha. 
 Send two tactical teams, highest priority. 
Have law enforcement establish a perimeter. 
 Where are you now? 
 Just north of the harbour. 
All right. Get Kim over here ASAP, 
all right? 
We gotta find Jack before he walks into a trap. 
We need to coordinate two... 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 (Andre) What's taking so long? 
 l just got here. 
 Where exactly? 
Don't worry, l'm close enough. 
Where's my daughter? 
 Right here. 
 Put her on the phone. 
Come to the parking lot of the freight office. 
l'll come out with her. 
 Let me speak to her first. 
 There's been enough talking. 
After what's happened, you expect me to trust you? 
You lied to us about Palmer being dead, so don't talk to me about trust, all right? 
Get down here now or l'll kill her myself. Trust that. 
l'm not gonna show myself until l speak to my daughter first. 
Don't test me. 
Bauer! 
 He's not coming. 
 He's coming. 
Nina, what's the ETA on the tac teams? 
Five on the alpha, eight on the beta. 
 lt doesn't matter. Stay on it. 
 (phone rings)  Myers. 
 (Jack) Nina, it's me. 
 Where are you? 
 Listen carefully. 
l've just confirmed that someone at CTU is feeding the Drazens information. 
 Based on what? 
 They know Palmer wasn't killed in the blast. 
Who at CTU had clearance for that kind of intel? 
 Besides me, just Tony, Mason and Chapelle. 
 One of those three is working for them. 
You need to find out which one. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
Where are you? 
Andre agreed to a trade. 
Me for Kim. 
 Are you gonna just walk right up to them? 
 lf l can guarantee Kim's safety, yes. 
Nina, there's a chance l won't be able to see this thing through. 
Until you find out who's giving the Drazens information, don't trust anyone. l gotta go. 
l don't think the situation will require much spin, as long as you do what you've been doing all along. 
 Tell me again what l've been doing, Mike. 
 Telling the truth. 
Oh, yeah. 
And tearing my family apart in the process. 
As hard as it's been for everyone, l think this last day has been about finding out who you really are. 
And not just as a candidate. 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 Mike, turn on the television. 
 (sighs)  What is it, Mike? 
A reliable source from inside Senator Palmer's campaign confirmed just moments ago that the senator was indeed unharmed  by the blast reported here over an hour ago. 
 Dammit! 
What is still uncertain is why the senator has not made a statement  and how the rumour of his death... 
 Sherry. 
David. We have to deal with the press. David! 
David! 
 You couldn't wait to leak it to the press. 
 David, l... 
 lt was you. What were you thinking? 
 They already knew. 
Dammit, Sherry! 
The way you keep defying me! 
 l'm not defying you! l am protecting you! 
 Protecting me from what? 
 Mike! 
 Back off, David. l mean it. 
 Get off me! 
 l mean it! 
 Get off me! 
 Back off! 
David, you have to talk to the press now. 
The longer you take to make a statement, the more control you give up. 
 Come on. 
 Dammit, if that child dies... 
(Nina dials phone)  Yes? 
 lt's me. 
 What is it? 
 They found his daughter. 
She'll be here within the hour. 
(sighs)  Does Bauer know? 
 No. Not yet. 
l'm the only one who's in contact with him. 
l've been ordered to send in two teams. 
 They're on their way. 
 Right. Hold on. 
They found the girl. Bauer doesn't know, 
but the CTU people are on their way. 
We have to get you out of here. 
He won't come if we can't produce the girl. 
He's not stupid. 
We just have time to get to international waters. 
l can't risk you getting captured again. 
Give me the phone. 
Can you contact Bauer? 
Yes. 
Tell him his daughter's dead. 
Her body was found floating in the harbour. 
 You think he'll come after you? 
 Yes. 
You'll have to kill him. 
No mistakes. 
lf he finds out l've lied to him, my cover will be blown. 
Of course we will kill him. 
That is the point. 
He is coming. 
 (phone rings)  Andre? 
No. lt's me. 
l think you should come back to CTU. 
l can't. l'm running out of time. 
l'm going in to get Kim now. 
 l don't know how to tell you this, Jack. 
 What is it, Nina? 
Nina, what is it? 
A coastguard cutter answered the APB we put out on Kim. 
 They found her body, Jack. 
 What? 
l'm sorry. 
She's dead. 
 No. 
 Jack, l'm so sorry. l know... Jack? 
Jack? 
(speaking in Serbian) What if Bauer doesn't come? He may be too 
crushed by the thought his daughter is dead. 
That is exactly why he will come. 
Believe me. l know. 
Go! Go! Hurry, Father. Get to the boat. 
Agh! 
(gun clicks) (gun clicks) (Palmer) lt has come to my attention that some misinformation was given to the press. 
And, again, l apologise for the misunderstanding. 
As you can imagine, this has been a very chaotic situation. 
But l appreciate the confidence the voters have continued to show for our campaign. 
We regret that false information has been broadcast regarding this incident. 
But, thankfully, no one was hurt. 
My family and l are safe, and we have no intention of letting this slow us down in any way. 
 Did you come in here to lecture me, Mike? 
 Lecture you on what? 
About how l'm not being supportive enough of David. 
Actually, l'm on your side this time. 
l think David was hurting himself with this charade. 
Maybe it's good you leaked the truth to the press. 
l wanna know what this entire day has done to his campaign. 
l think we should run some focus groups first thing in the morning. 
l've already called Robin over at ASl. 
OK. Good. Do you think David should cancel 
his trip to Dallas, go back to Washington? 
l don't know, Sherry. 
l think... David should make that call. 
Oh, no. l don't. David's in no frame of mind 
to make critical decisions right now. 
lt's gonna take you and l to steer this thing by ourselves, OK? 
Until he gets his head screwed on right. 
Listen, Sherry. 
David wanted to meet you privately when he finished his statement. 
David doesn't need to make an appointment to see me, Mike. l'm right here. 
He'll be in the ballroom in five minutes. 
l've already called the Secret Service. 
What... what's this all about? 
He didn't say. 
lf l were you... 
l'd take it as an opportunity to make the first move... 
to patch things up, make things right, Sherry. 
Fine, Mike. 
(Mason) lt's too much. 
Tony, get this. 
l'll call you back. 
Tac team gets there. Jack didn't wait. 
 He went in without 'em. 
 By himself? 
 Evidently. 
 ls he all right? 
 He's alive. 
 What about the Drazens? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Dead. 
Congratulations, Teri. Your family's fine. 
They're on their way here. 
Anyway, Karris counts seven down. 
Jack's the last man standing. 
 Contact Secret Service. l'll update Division. 
 l talked to Jack an hour ago. 
 He said he was on his way to get Kim. 
 Everybody's fine. 
Now go in there and celebrate. 
Relax. 
Nina? 
Can l help you? 
(woman) Ja? 
(in German) (Nina speaks German)  Just call me when it's time. 
 Someone is there? 
 Yes. 
 l understand. 
 You speak German? 
 Frankfurt Division. 
 Something wrong? 
 Yeah. 
l heard there was some big shoot-out. 
l can't get anyone to tell me what's going on. 
Teri, calm down. Jack and Kim are fine. 
They're on their way here right now. 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
 And the men that were after Kim and me? 
 They're dead. 
You and Kim are completely safe. 
 And so is Jack. 
 OK. 
l just want us all to be back together again. 
lt won't be long. 
 Thank God. 
 (phone rings)  This is Myers. 
 You're still not alone? 
 That's right. 
 Listen carefully. 
Procedures are in place. 
Collect all of your information. 
 We have arranged for your extraction. 
 Where? 
The usual pick-up point. 
Northwest corner. 
ls there anything else? 
No. l know you're busy. 
l'm gonna let you get back to work. 
l can't let you go. 
Not yet. 
Move back into the room. 
Slowly. 
l said move! 
Against the wall. 
On your knees. 
Do it! 
Officer! 
The body that you guys pulled out of the harbour. lt was my daughter. 
 l'd like to claim the body. 
 Not sure what you're referring to. 
The coastguard. 
They pulled a body out of the harbour. 
 ln the last hour? 
 l didn't hear anything. l just got on duty. 
 lf you'd like, l can call the harbour master. 
 Hold on one second. 
Give me your phone. 
 Could you call him now, please? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Harbour master's office. 
 Hey, Frank. 
Did you pull a body out of the harbour tonight? 
 Uh, no. Nothing on our patrol. 
 Are you sure? 
 No reports anywhere. 
 All right. Roger that. 
 What did he say? 
 No body was found in the harbour or near it. 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
ls it possible another unit picked her up? 
We cover 50 miles of coastline. 
There was no body found tonight. 
Thanks. 
Thank you. 
(phone rings)  This is Mason. 
 Hey, it's Jack. 
Shall l congratulate you or demand your resignation? 
 Do you know where my daughter is? 
 As a matter of fact l do. 
Highway Patrol picked her up half an hour ago. She's heading here now. 
 lf you'd called, l could have told you. 
 You need to arrest Nina. 
 What? 
 She's working against us. 
 Don't let her out of the building. 
 Jack, hold on. What's all this about? 
She told me that the coastguard found Kim's body. 
l confirmed with them they never found a body tonight. 
She was working with the Drazens to set a trap for me. 
Are you sure it wasn't a misunderstanding? 
About Kim being dead? No, she lied. 
There was no misunderstanding. 
lt doesn't sound like there's any proof either. 
l'll get you your proof. 
Just don't let her out of your sight. 
(Jack dials phone) (phone rings)  Archives. Wilson. 
 Hey, Paul. lt's Jack. 
l need a copy of the security tape from this morning, between 8.50 and 9am in the lTS, 
when Jamey committed suicide in there. 
All right. 
Let me check. 
 That's weird. 
 What, you got it? 
 Yes, sir. Except the tape was erased. 
 When? 
 This morning. 
 The digital backup? 
There's no digital backup system for lTS. 
There is. You need the clearance code. 
Try: C 2 2 7 1 7. 
 How long is this gonna take? 
 Just a few minutes. 
OK. Get back to me as soon as you can. 
(horns blare) Wait a moment, please. 
David? 
Mike said you wanted to see me. 
Yes. 
l know we need to talk, but... 
Honestly, David, we haven't slept in two days. 
Can't it wait till the morning? 
(Sherry) We've had a rough day. 
And, yes, l know that you are very angry with me. 
But when we've put this day in perspective, you'll realise that l've been acting in your best interest all along. 
 l'm not angry with you, Sherry. 
 Oh, good, David. 
l feel sorry for you. 
You feel sorry for me? 
You've lost touch with what it is to be... 
a parent. 
A friend. 
A wife. 
What? 
After tonight... 
l don't wanna see you again. 
 David, will you just... 
 Sherry, please. l've heard it all before. 
And l don't care what this may do to my candidacy. 
And it's not because l don't wanna be president. l do. 
l just don't think you're fit to be the first lady. 
(sighs) Do you really think that you can just leave me? 
Don't believe for a second that it's gonna be that easy. 
Secret Service will take you back to Washington whenever you're ready. 
David. 
David, you just don't walk away from me! 
David, you can't do this without me! 
David, l'm talking to you! 
 Sorry, ma'am. 
 Get your hands off of me. 
 (phone rings)  Yeah? 
lt's Wilson. l got the Jamey Farrell 
interrogation footage for you. 
Good. l've got a monitor in my car. 
Upload it and send it to me. 
Yeah, sure thing. 
Oh, my God! 
Send this over to Mason. His eyes only. 
Then patch me through to him. 
(phone rings)  Mason. 
l'm sending something. 
Are you in front of your screen? 
 Yeah. What is it? 
 Proof against Nina. She killed Jamey. 
 What? Why... 
 Can you see it? 
Uh... yeah. 
Oh. 
This is unbelievable. 
Where are you right now? 
 l'm about five minutes out. 
 OK. 
Find her, George. 
(continuous beeping)  Where are you? 
 l'm leaving now. 
You have 16 minutes to reach the pick-up point. 
We're routing you through Munich for three days. 
Why Germany? 
Why can't l come to you directly? 
l don't know.  
These are the instructions. 
You'll need to be untraceable during that time. 
Make sure nothing can connect you to Germany. 
 Did you hear me? 
 Yeah. All right. 
l'm leaving now, Teri. 
l'm gonna lock you in from the outside. 
Someone will find you soon. 
Everything will be fine. 
 Anything? 
 Nothing. 
Miss Myers! 
Yeah... 
Put your hands where l can see them! 
Nina, put your hands on the steering wheel! 
Jack. 
lf you kill me, you won't know  who l work for. 
You think l work for Drazen, but l don't. 
l trusted you. 
 l was just doing my job. 
 Your job? 
My wife and daughter almost died today. 
How many people that trusted you lost their life today because you were doing your job? 
Walsh. Jamey. Ellis. 
 How many others? 
 How many died because of you, Jack? 
(Mason) Jack, take it easy.  
We need her alive. 
Come on, Jack.  
Kim just got here. 
They're taking her inside right now.  
Come on. 
(Tony) Jack, don't do it. 
Come on, Jack.  
Come and be with your family. 
 Come on.  
Let's go. 
Let's go inside. 
This is no good. Come on, Jack. 
Good, Jack.  
Come on. 
Come on.  
lt's OK. 
You all right? 
You did the right thing. 
You wanna take her up? 
Come on. 
All right.  
Let's go. 
 Sweetheart! 
 Dad! 
 Thank God you're all right. Aah! 
 Oh, l'm sorry. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah, baby. l'm all right. How about you? 
 l'm fine. 
 Are you sure? 
 l'm positive. Oh, l was so worried. 
 Oh, sweetheart. 
lt's all over, baby. 
No one's gonna hurt you now, l promise. 
 l love you so much. 
 l love you. 
 Where's Mom? 
 l... l thought she was here with you. 
l'll go find her. 
Just stay here with the guards, OK? 
 OK. 
 OK. 
(TV) ..two assassination attempts 
just hours apart. 
lt may take days, even weeks, before the details become clear, but sources close to the ClA cite Special Agent Jack Bauer of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit as the man responsible for saving Palmer. 
 Still nothing. 
 One... 
Have you searched the floor yet?  
Have you searched the floor?!! 
Not yet, sir. 
Teri! 
Teri? 
Teri! 
Teri! 
Oh, my God. 
Come on.  
Come on. 
No.  
Oh, God. 
Teri?  
Teri, no. 
Teri, no. 
No. 
Teri... 
Please, no. 
Come on, baby.  
Come on. Come on. 
 l'm glad you moved back in, Daddy. 
 Me too, sweetie. 
 OK. 
 Good. 
 l really appreciate that. 
 You really, really appreciate it? 
 You really appreciate it? How much? 
 Jack. 
l'm so sorry... 
so sorry. 
(Kim) No! 
(Dan) Keep moving. 
(Dan) Shut up! 
Put her down. Put her down. 
(Rick) Keep movin'. 
(Dan) Shut up! Let's go. Come on, keep goin'. 
 We have to go back. 
 She's dead. 
 You don't know that. 
 Get in! 
 Take it easy. 
 You better decide whose side you're on! 
We can't just leave her in the middle of the street. 
Nina... 
 Nina, l know you're upset. 
 Of course l'm upset. What do you expect? 
Sorry. Look, the reason why l had to leave 
the office is because l got a call from Walsh. 
He was meeting one of our agents, Scott Baylor. He said he had evidence... 
That led you to me, l know. 
But you should have thought it through. 
Nina, listen to me. Richard Walsh is dead. 
 What? 
 He was shot. l watched him die. 
What is going on? 
He was killed cos he had proof that people within our agency are behind the Palmer hit. 
 Who? 
 l don't know yet. 
Right before Richard died he gave me that key card. 
l'm hoping that's going to tell us. 
Jamey's trying to break it down now. 
 You trust Jamey? 
 He did. l trust you. 
The three of us have to work together. 
From this point forward we have to assume that we can trust nobody else. 
 l understand. 
 Good. 
Are you all right? 
Yeah. 
Work the card with Jamey. 
l have to make a call. 
Agent Pierce wanted to talk to you. 
 Fine. Give me a minute. 
 lt's very important. 
A minute. 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 Find anything out? 
lt's barely been half an hour since you told me. 
l need you to find out the source of this story. 
Not first thing in the morning, now. 
This can't be done over the phone. 
l have to talk to some people in person. 
l wanna hear something by four. 
 You've gotta let me... 
 (hangs up)  Where were you? 
 l went for a drive. 
A drive? Alone, at this time of night? 
 l just needed to get away for a while. 
 Away from what? 
Everything. 
They haven't told you, have they? 
There's been an assassination threat. 
 That's what all the fuss is about? 
 Yes. 
l thought it was something serious. 
Jack. l'm screening the passenger list. 
Something doesn't add up here. 
 What? 
 2B. Manifest shows an empty seat. 
So? 
According to the ticketing file, first class was full. Plus there was a waiting list. 
Why would the plane take off with an empty seat? 
This is good. 
What time does Rayburn get in? 
 Six. 
 Wake him up. Bring him in now. 
Jack. 
OK. We've got something off the key card. 
The encryption is complex. l've asked 
Jamey to isolate sectors. She's extracted one. 
Just part of one. 
That's it, just an address? 
What's that got to do with Palmer? 
 lt doesn't say. 
 Crosscheck it with his schedule. 
 He's not going anywhere near it. 
 Has he been near it since he came here? 
No. 
How about previous visits? 
Connection to family members? 
l can check. lt'll take time. 
No. Let's see what 
we can peel off. Start in here. 
Just the address on San Fernando Road. 
How long will it take you to access the next level? Minutes or hours? 
 Hours, most likely. 
 We don't have hours. 
l'll check out the address myself. 
 You want some backup? 
 No. l need you here. 
 What's wrong? 
 l can't access our decryption software. 
Phones are down, too. 
lt's a lockdown. 
lt's Mason. Hide the key card. 
l'll handle this. 
Hello, Nina. These men are with lnternal 
lnvestigations. You are in official lockdown. 
 By what authority? 
 District Office. 
We're trying to stop an assassination. Can't 
you find anything better to do than this? 
Two agents died tonight. A lockdown's 
standard procedure until we get answers. 
 Where's Jack? 
 l don't know. 
Station two, coming your way. 
Lockdown. Nobody leaves. 
 Lockdown? Are you serious? 
 No, l'm kidding. 
 l gotta get some work from the car. 
 You know the drill. 
Fine. You take the keys. 
All right. l assume you're all 
familiar with lockdown procedures. 
You remain in the building. 
All communications will be monitored. 
Any incoming calls without secure access codes will be blocked. 
ln the meantime, continue to work on the systems available until notified otherwise. 
Who called them in, Tony? You? 
Yeah, me. 
 Why? 
 Somebody had to. Jack's out of control. 
Meaning what? 
Two agents are down. 
Jack was there when it happened. 
You can't believe he was involved in that. 
Tell you the truth, l don't know what to believe. 
l'd hate to think this has anything to do with me. 
 You think what you want. 
 (Mason) Could be here for quite a while. 
He got past me. 
All right, Nina, where'd he go? 
l already told you, l don't know. 
You let me know, we can get things up and running. 
l'm really sorry, George. l can't help you out. 
Mm-hm. Me, too. 
Senator, could l have a word with you? 
l'm not sure you appreciate the seriousness of this threat. 
l get serious threats every morning. 
With all due respect, this one's different. 
lt's a pro from overseas. 
 Who's behind it? 
 We don't know. 
But as l'm sure you're aware, an airliner exploded an hour and a half ago outside LA. 
 No survivors. 
 There's some connection? 
Again, we don't know. We're looking into it. 
What do we know? 
That these are serious people, and they want you dead, today. 
 What about my family? 
 The threat is against you only. 
But of course we'll increase security for your family as well. 
The main thing is your schedule. 
Today's primary day. 
l'm not gonna hide in my hotel room. 
Understood, but we recommend some changes. The breakfast, for example. 
The breakfast is important. The top labour 
leaders in the state are gonna be there. 
We're trying to keep you alive. 
And l'm trying to win an election. 
(door opens) Mom said you wanted to see me. 
Wanted to make sure you're all right. 
Why are you up? 
lf l'm not sleeping by three, l'm not sleeping. 
l was gonna watch some tube. 
Wanna join me? 
 Anything on this time of night? 
 Nothing good. 
l guess l'll pass. 
Heard about the threat. 
Don't worry about it. 
They'll take good care of me. 
They better. 
You better get some rest. 
l'm telling you, we have to go back and get Janet. 
Are you gonna tell your girlfriend to shut her mouth? 
 She's probably dead. 
 What if she's not? She might need help. 
Why do you always do what he tells you? 
Why don't you think for yourself? 
 Just leave it alone, OK? 
 l can't. She's my friend. 
You know, she may be right after all. 
We should go back. 
lf she's alive, she can lD us. 
 We have to shut her up for good. 
 What?! What are you saying? 
You're gonna kill her? 
You're gonna kill Janet, huh? Huh? 
Close her mouth. Now! 
l'm not gonna let you tie me up! No! 
Sounds like she's gonna tie you up. 
(Teri) l just hope the girls are still there. 
(siren) Oh, no. 
l don't believe this. 
Stay in your car, sir. Back in the car. 
Keep your hands where l can see 'em. 
 Do you know how fast you were drivin'? 
 Yes. Our daughters are missing. 
We got a phone call. 
We're on our way to pick them up. 
 Licence and registration. 
 Did you hear what l said? 
Officer, my name is Teri Bauer. 
He's telling the truth. 
We really could use your help. My daughter 
just phoned from Platt's Auto Body. 
Different last names. 
One's married, one's not. 
l just called 911 15 minutes ago. 
Verify it if you want. 
 You know what? l'm gonna do that. 
 Yeah. Why don't you do that? 
 Listen... 
 l said remain in the car. 
l understand that. Can we speed things up? 
Write us a ticket so we can go? 
The woman asked me to verify the 911. 
That's what l'm trying to do. 
You know, you are a real piece of work. You know that? 
 My daughter is in trouble. We're finished. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. 
 (cop) Relax, everyone. Whoa. 
 (York) Get your hands off me! 
No. Stop. Don't do that. 
Please, don't do this. 
Ma'am, he just disobeyed a direct order from a police officer. 
 l'm afraid l'll have to place him under arrest. 
 You've gotta be kidding me. 
You know Richard Walsh was killed tonight. 
Scott Baylor, too. 
Did you know Jack was there when it happened? 
l don't know anything about it. 
 And you have no idea where he is now? 
 No. 
 You're making a big mistake, Nina. 
 No, you are. 
When this lockdown is over, l'll talk with the Double l team, about some highly irregular banking transactions traced to your account. 
Trust me, the trouble Jack's in, my bank accounts won't even raise an eyebrow. 
He's going down, Nina. But that doesn't 
mean you have to go down with him. 
True love is a beautiful thing, but... 
why go to extremes? 
l know about the affair. 
l mean, Jack talks about it all the time. 
 Sure he does. 
 How else would l know about it? 
See, it is possible that Jack's not the shining knight you think he is. 
You wanna try again? 
Where's Jack now? 
(cop) This is Mary-138. Need a 
transportation unit at the Fifth Street bridge. 
 (phone rings)  (cop) Ma'am. OK. Please, ma'am. 
(radio) 1-M-38. 
Repeat location with full request. 
(cop) 1-Mary-38. l need a transportation unit. 
(phone rings) lt's Teri. Leave a message, 
and l'll callyou back. 
Honey, it's me. l'm just checking up 
on Kim. l'll call you back soon. 
Don't move. 
Dammit! 
2-Adam-14. Reporting shots fired at 
18166 San Fernando Road. Request backup. 
(radio) 2-Adam-14. 
Backup on the way, 18166 San Fernando. 
Stop! Police! 
 Hold it right there! 
 Federal agent. 
 Your badge. Nice and slow. 
 Putting my gun down. 
 CTU? What the hell is that? 
 Counter Terrorist Unit. 
This guy is not waiting for me, so you better shoot me or help me, but decide now. 
 All right, l'll help you. 
 l'm picking up my gun. 
Easy. 
You be careful with that gun. l need him alive. 
Throw me your flashlight. 
(phone rings) (Jack) Take cover. 
 (radio) 2Adam14. Backup's on the way. 
 2Adam14. Copy. 
Turn off your radio. 
 l wish you hadn't called for backup. 
 Why? 
Cops have to play by the rules. 
l'll have to break a few with this guy. 
Who is he? 
So to sum it up, Jack leaves his wife, shacks up with you for a while, gets bored, and then moves back home, leaving you out in the cold. 
My personal life is not your concern. 
 lt is if it affects your work. 
 lt doesn't affect my work. 
How long have you been with the agency, Nina? Six years, seven? 
Seven years. 
l remember when you first joined. 
You were goin' places. Everybody knew it. 
lt hasn't quite happened for you yet, has it? 
 You ever wonder why? 
 l've done all right. 
But you could have done so much better. 
You had a great reputation once. 
You know what your reputation is now? 
Jack's flunky. His lapdog. 
This is your chance to get back on track, Nina. 
He's a loose cannon. 
Rules don't apply to Jack Bauer. 
He does what he wants when he wants, and he doesn't care whose life it affects. 
He shot me with a trank gun, for God's sakes. 
 You withheld information. 
 l was following orders. 
Maybe he's following orders you don't know about. 
He violated lockdown, and he left you holding the bag. 
lf he cared about you, he wouldn't have put you in that position. 
Let me ask you, would you have done that to him? 
Fact is, l'm just asking you to do your job and tell me where he is. 
l don't know. 
(squeaking) (Jack) Get down! Get down! 
(in Spanish) (janitor) S�. Bueno. 
(sobs)  (Rick) Maybe she's dead after all. 
 (Dan) We have to be sure. 
 Let's just put her in the van. 
 No. 
 Dan... 
 Shut up! 
(siren) Move it! 
Yeah? 
 Mason's gonna wanna talk to you. 
 What do you want me to say? 
Jack's made it clear that the three of us work in confidence. 
 But doesn't Mason supersede Jack? 
 No, no. 
What we're doing came from Walsh. 
George will say anything to get you to talk. 
Do not be intimidated by him. 
OK. 
Cross me. 
(creaking) (running footsteps)  The other building. 
 Jeez, this place is like a maze. 
(Carl) All right. l've got a name. 
George Ferragamo. Know him? 
Yeah. l know the name. 
You find anything else, leave a message on the 802 number only. 
OK. You got it. 
Thanks, Carl. 
You've been spending an awful lot of time behind closed doors, making phone calls. 
 Have l? 
 What's going on, David? 
Phone call earlier tonight from Maureen Kingsley. 
She's digging up old history. 
Bad history. 
Just tell me. 
She claims that Keith murdered the boy who raped Nicole. 
What? 
Well, first, Lyle Gibson was no boy. He was 19. 
Second, he killed himself. 
The coroner's report proved it. 
 Maureen has new evidence. 
 What evidence? 
l put Carl on it. 
He came up with a name. George Ferragamo. 
That's the therapist Keith went to. 
What about him? 
 He claims that... 
 Not that Keith confessed in therapy? 
 Apparently. 
 Well, then he's lying. 
 You've gotta get our lawyers on this. 
 Yeah, l know. l will. 
 But, you know... 
 What is it, David? 
l just don't understand it. 
Maureen's always been very responsible, one of the few real professionals left. 
Well, l'd call this unprofessional. 
David! 
David, you can't seriously think that our son might be a killer? 
No, of course not. 
 Look, l apologised. 
 You don't get it, do you? 
 You've committed a serious crime. 
 Officer, please. 
Clearly he's upset. We both are. 
lf you could just give us a break, please. 
 (radio) 1Mary38. 
 1Mary38. Go. 
1-Mary-38. That emergency call was placed at 
that location approximately 30 minutes ago. 
Copy. Thanks. 
That still doesn't justify you disobeying a police officer. 
ldiot! 
 Ground units'll be on their way. 
 l need him now to claim jurisdiction. 
 Where do you want me? 
 Keep him pinned down at the exit. 
l'll try and go round the other side. Don't hit him. 
 l won't. 
 Don't hit me either. 
(loudhailer) This is the police. 
Drop your weapon. 
�Dios m�o! �Por favor! �Por favor! 
 l told you to stay put! 
 Yo no hice nada. 
(man) Over here! 
 You want me, come and get me. 
 (cop) Don't do it! He'll kill both of us! 
(cop) Don't do it! 
Come out! Drop the gun! 
Don't! 
Step out where l can see you and throw down the gun. 
(cop) Don't do it! 
 l'll drop the gun, but you've gotta relax. 
 Don't do it. 
Shut up. Put down the gun. 
Speak English, asshole! 
l'm putting down the gun! 
The gun's going down. 
Good work. Throw me your cuffs. 
Oh, my God. 
(Teri) l think it might be up here, somewhere to the right. 
(York) Yeah, maybe. 
(York) There's someone up ahead. Maybe 
they saw something. Roll down your window. 
Excuse me. Could you tell me 
what happened here, please? 
 lt might involve our children. 
 You shouldn't let your children come here. 
Yeah, l know. But could you just 
please tell me what happened? 
Girl was hit by a car. 
Do you know where they took her? 
St Mark's is closest. 
Was she alive? 
 She didn't look good. 
 Go, go, go, go. 
(Dan) Hey, it's Gaines. 
 Where's the other one? 
 She was a problem, so we killed her. 
 The body? 
 No one'll find it. 
 She been any trouble? 
 Not at all. 
You're with me now. 
Be good, you'll be back at the mall in a day or two. Be bad, you won't. Clear? 
 Mmhm. 
 Good. 
Agent Farrell, come with me, please. 
Jamey. 
l've already told these men, l don't know anything. 
Tryin' to protect Jack and Nina? 
Don't be naive. 
Sit. 
Let me tell you how the game is played. 
First thing they do is to tell you that you're the only one they can trust. 
That's flattering, and it makes you trust them in return. All right? 
Then they get you to do something you shouldn't. 
Say you don't know where Jack went, for example. 
The next thing you know, Jack's gone, Nina's stonewalling, and you're in the hot seat. 
Sound familiar? 
Hey, you're being used. 
l've seen it a million times. 
lf you help me out, l'll help you out. 
lf you hold out... 
(phone rings) Mason. 
Really? Good. l'm on my way. 
Seems our boy's surfaced. His name 
popped up on a police frequency. 
 Not that l'm surprised. 
 ls he in trouble? 
Off the record, just out of curiosity, what's so special about Jack Bauer? 
All right, we've found Bauer. 
We're pulling out. Lockdown's over. 
Hope you give some thought to what we talked about. 
(man) Call it in as a DOA. 
Everything checked out. Here you go. 
What was her name? 
Jessie Hampton. 
Know anything about this guy? 
 No. l gotta take him in for questioning. 
 Maybe you didn't notice, he killed a cop. 
 But there's something else at stake here. 
 Not to me. Not to these guys. 
All right. 
Can l at least have a few minutes with him? 
Guys. 
Thank you. 
Get up. 
lf you tell me who you are, l might be able to help you. 
 Don't let them take me. lf they do, l'm dead. 
 They seem in control. 
l'm not worried about them. 
 Who are you worried about? 
 You spring me, then l talk. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 That's too bad... 
Bauer. 
Bauer. How do you know my name? 
(cop) Time's up. 
l know more than that. lf you ever wanna see 
your daughter again, get me outta this. 
What do you know about my daughter?! 
l'm fine! l'm fine! 
l'm fine. 
You're seeing the senator in an hour. 
Get going, or you'll hit traffic. 
l'm on my way. 
(Gaines) Eyes straight ahead, Jack. 
Let the cops go. 
lt's a green light, Jack. 
Make a right. 
l left something foryou underyour visor. 
What do you want me to do with this? 
l'll tell you when you get to your office. 
You pull something off the key card? 
 l may be close to finding your assassin. 
 You got a name? 
Almost. This is a scrambled medical file 
listing a series of plastic surgeries. 
The shooter's probably trying to hide his identity. 
Or assume someone else's. 
 To get close to Palmer. 
 Mmhm. Call me when you get a name. 
Right. 
Pull over. 
 Keith! 
 Let my man bring him in. 
No. 
 Senator, there's a threat on your life. 
 Call your man off. 
Sir! All right, Jimmy, stand down. 
 Keith! Hold up. 
 Go away. 
 l need to talk to you. 
 Mom said you're doin' all the talkin'. 
At the breakfast l'm gonna tell our side of the story. 
Our side? 
Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out, spin it the wrong way. 
lt won't matter how the story comes out. 
Everyone will still think l went to kill Gibson. 
Who's gonna believe it was an accident? 
l believe you, son, if you say so. 
Look, when your mother and l go to this breakfast in an hour,  we want you and Nicole to come with us. 
 Why? 
So you can save your campaign by sacrificing me to CNN? 
So l can stand by you, as your father. 
lt's a little late for that. 
 You never gave me a chance to help you. 
 How could l? You weren't there! 
You... you can tell yourself 
whatever you want, but your career always came first. 
For you to expect me to stand up in front of everyone now and act like we're this family... 
We are a family, Keith. 
Keith! 
You missed a spot, right here on your neck. 
Rick, help me get out of here. 
How? This place is like a prison. 
People break out of prison all the time. 
Look, Gaines said he'd let me go after l'd buried Dan. 
Now, once l'm out of here, l'll call your dad and tell him where you are. 
Great plan, except you're not gonna get out. 
 Gaines won't let you go. 
 He's got no reason to stop me. 
 He doesn't need me any more. 
 Exactly. 
 What do you want me to do here? 
 Replace the key card we gave you with the one your people are trying to decrypt. 
 Because we're getting too close? 
 Just do it, Jack. 
(Gaines) Remember, Jack, l can hear everything. 
l've been trying to reach you. 
What is going on? 
 My cellphone battery died. 
 What happened at the hospital? 
 Did you find Kim? 
 Everything's fine. She was just at a party. 
 That's good. Did Teri give you my message? 
 No. 
We lD'd the corpse you brought in. 
His name is Alan York. 
 What? 
 He's an accountant from the valley. 
We still don't know how he's connected to this. 
But we did have a breakthrough in the key card. 
Give me one minute. 
lf Alan York is dead, who is the man with my wife? 
He's not an accountant from the valley, that's for sure. 
lf you harm my daughter or my wife, l will kill you, you son of a bitch. 
(gunshot) Oh, my God! What have you done? 
What have you done?! 
Everything's fine, Jack. But that will be 
the last sound your wife and daughter hear unless you get hold of yourself and you do as you're told. 
 l'll do what you want. 
 That's the spirit. 
Now, the key card. l wantyou to replace it 
with the one you took from the car. 
 That won't be easy. 
 Well, l'm sure you'll find a way. 
Not without attracting attention. 
That would be unacceptable. 
You implicate yourself, you cease to be useful and so does your family. 
As l said, Jack, find a way. 
 Fine. 
 OK. 
(ringing tone) The cellular customeryou are trying to reach is currently out ofrange. 
Please leave a message at the tone. 
Kevin. Bauer's wife knows 
you're not Alan York. Be careful. 
 You OK? 
 l feel a little woozy. 
We're almost there. 
Janet said the party was up this hill. 
 l'm sorry, but l think l'm gonna be sick. 
 Try and take deep breaths. 
Would you just pull over and stop the car? 
You have one new message. 
(Gaines) ..Bauer's wife... notAlan York. 
Be careful. 
Teri? 
Teri? 
Teri! 
Dammit. 
Come on. 
Oh, dammit. 
Dan's buried. 
Oh, that's good. 
You said you'd pay me when we got back here. 
Yeah, l know what l said. 
Well, if it's a problem, pay me whenever. 
Oh, that's very kind of you, Rick. 
But l should probably go, get out of everyone's way. 
 l didn't realise you were in anyone's way. 
 Well, l'm not, it's just... 
l did everything you wanted me to do, so there's no reason for me to be here. 
Tell you what. 
l've got a couple more things for you to do, and then we can talk about when you can go. 
This is taking too long, Jack. 
l can't just switch the cards. lt'll attract 
attention that'll be bad for us both. 
You've got three minutes to make this happen. 
Fine, l'll do it. 
l just need to make it look natural when l go down to the work station. 
Drop the pen and shred the paper. 
That's right, Jack. l'm watching you. 
Shred the note now oryour daughter dies. 
What happened? l was telling you something 
important and you just walk away. 
l'm sorry. What did you wanna tell me? 
 l think Milo's about to identify the shooter. 
 That's great. 
 We just need a few minutes with the card. 
 (Gaines) Switch it, Jack. No more excuses. 
Um... 
Look, that's terrific. Uh... 
Tell Milo to wait until l get down there. 
 Stop working on the card? 
 Just until l get there. 
 Why? 
 Because l asked you to! 
Look, l'm only gonna be a minute. 
All right. But hurry. He's in section seven. 
l'll be right down. 
Palmer was absent from the rally, but he was represented by his children, Nicole and Keith, who've been instrumental in bringing the younger voter to this election. 
And Governor Hodges spent the morning with heads ofCalifornia's labour unions, discussing the importance ofhis new healthcare proposal. 
lt would ensure comprehensive coverage ofmillions ofactive union members. 
Also this morning Governor Hodges will meet with... 
Mom told you what's been going on? 
Yeah. 
ls Keith goin' to jail? 
 Not if it happened the way he says it did. 
 lt did. 
Then he'll be fine. 
ls he coming to the breakfast? 
l hope so. 
Listen, l know it's a lot to ask. 
Don't worry, Dad. 
l'll be there. 
You're gonna get a lot of hard questions thrown at you. 
Not just about Keith. 
They're gonna bring up the rape. 
l know. 
You're gonna be OK. 
l was hoping it was over. 
Not talking about it all these years... 
l started to let myself believe it never happened. 
You don't have to answer anything you don't want to. 
Just say ''No comment''. Or refer them to me. 
You're close to finding the shooter? 
 Yeah. 
 How much longer? 
 Not long. l was waiting for you. 
 Why would you be waiting for me? 
 (Jack) Sorry. 
 (Milo) lt's fine. l got it. 
(Milo) Nina told me to hold off till you got here. 
She must've misunderstood me. 
That's my boy. 
l just wasted ten minutes. 
Get your signals straight. 
Milo, just get me the name. 
Why are you doing this? 
No, l already gave you that code. 
 What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? 
l already computed this inverse, and now it's not working. 
 lt might be the sectors aren't linked. 
 Oh, you think so, huh? 
You were right. 
 Nice one. 
 Cool. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Bad idea. 
You flag down that car, you bury your daughter. 
l'm your only hope of getting her back. 
lf l don't deliver you in half an hour, Kimberly's dead. 
Where is she, you son of a bitch? 
You gonna knock me out again? 
l can't talk if l'm unconscious. 
 Where's Kimberly? 
 Let me go and l'll take you to her. 
You're not going anywhere. 
Calling the cops would be just as bad. 
Or are you calling Jack? 
 l don't think that's gonna help, either. 
 Shut up. Shut up. Shut your mouth. 
 Operations. 
 Jack Bauer. 
Clearance number Q22Q17. Pass me to 
Senator Palmer's Secret Service liaison. 
 Hold, please. 
 What do you want me to tell them? 
That you need priority clearance at the breakfast. 
 Frank Miller. 
 Hey, Frank. lt's Jack Bauer over at CTU. 
 l need priority clearance for the breakfast. 
 We locked the list. 
 Open it up. 
 l can't without approval from Command. 
Then call Command. 
My clearance number is Q22Q17. 
All right. You'll be checking in 
with Agent Pierce when you arrive. 
Thanks. 
OK. Now call Division. 
Post yourself out for the next hour. 
Tell them you're going to the breakfast and the investigation's making good progress. 
(rattling) Rick. 
Well... you were right. 
Gaines isn't lettin' me go yet. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 l don't know. 
Let's get outta here, Rick. 
We're here. 
There's a fence here which is over that way. 
They got people everywhere, but l noticed they're a little thin right around this area. 
(man) Yo, Rick! 
Come here. 
 Get off of me! 
 What the hell are you doin'? 
Give me five minutes, dude. 
No one has to know. 
 l'll give you four. 
 (Kimberly) No, don't. 
l'll be outside. 
When l go back out, l'll leave the door unlocked. 
l'll see his back is turned so you can get out. 
Go across the path behind the shed and wait for me there. 
Be careful. 
 Sorry l hit you. 
 No. 
No. Not true. 
Also not true. 
What's wrong? 
This isn't the same key card l was working from before. 
 What makes you say that? 
 lt's giving me different data. 
 What? 
 l was 20 per cent through this thing. 
 Now it's saying it's 99 per cent complete. 
 Well, isn't that good? 
Yeah, if it were true, but l don't believe it. 
This is a different key card. 
You've been sitting here this entire time. 
Who could have switched it? 
l need to post out until eight. 
No, that won't be necessary. 
Yes, l'm reachable. Thank you. Bye. 
Nina, l can't talk right now. 
There's an emergency down at Division. 
 Where's the key card? 
 What? 
Careful, Jack. 
Somebody replaced the key card Walsh gave you with this one. 
 Who? 
 Milo thinks it was you. 
 Jack? 
 What are you talking about? 
The only time Milo took his eyes off the system was when you distracted him. 
OK, you're right. 
l just didn't wanna alarm anyone. 
Division got some information. 
They didn't trust Milo with it. 
Where's the key card, Jack? 
Take care of this, Jack. 
Give it to me, Jack, or l'll call Division myself. 
Fine. There's the key card. 
What are you doing? 
l'm sorry, Nina. l'm sorry. 
But, believe me, l will kill you if l have to. 
Now, no screaming. 
Get her out of there now! 
 Put this on. 
 Jack, l don't understand. 
 Why are you...? 
 Nina, don't talk. 
l will explain everything as soon as we get out of here. 
Nice and quiet. 
Open the door. 
 Where are you guys going? 
 Division set up a meeting between agencies. 
Nina will brief you when she gets back. 
Jack, where are you taking me? 
Just start the car and drive. 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 Jack. 
 Who? 
 My husband, Jack Bauer. lt's urgent. 
 This phone was lying on the ground. 
 Where are you? 
 St Mark's Hospital, the parking lot. 
 Did anything happen there? 
 Not that l saw. Shall l call the cops? 
 No. No. 
Oh, come on. 
 CTU. 
 Who is this? 
 lt's Jamey. Who's this? 
 lt's Teri Bauer. ls Jack there? 
 He just left with Nina. 
 ls he OK? He lost his cellphone. 
 l thought something might have happened. 
 He seemed fine. Can l help you, Teri? 
Yeah. l'm in trouble 
and so is my daughter Kim. 
OK. Wait, wait. Slow down. 
Tell me what's wrong. 
 Kimberly's been kidnapped. 
 My God. 
 They tried to take me too. 
 Did you call the police? 
Jack says they can't be involved or we'll risk Kimberly's life. 
Tell me where you are so l can send someone to pick you up. 
OK. l'm on Mulholland, 
about a mile east of Coldwater. 
 Jamey, tell them to hurry. 
 OK. 
(TV) OK, we're coming up on the hour. 
lt's about the time the polls are about to open. 
Not that far offnow. 
l wanna remind everyone... 
You look handsome. Presidential. 
 Where's Keith? 
 He's, uh... still in his room. 
We don't have much time. 
David. 
What if Maureen could be persuaded not to come forward with the story? 
l already spoke to her. There's no way. 
There's always a way. 
 What are you getting at? 
 Maureen is just like everybody else. 
She's got a past. What if there was something 
in her past that she wanted to keep there? 
 You mean blackmail? 
 l don't care what you call it. 
l'm just trying to save our son. 
And your candidacy. 
You've been talking to Carl. 
You left me no choice. 
No one has to know what happened. 
l'd know. We would know. 
After everything we've been through tonight,  how can you justify burying the truth? 
 Because it's been buried for seven years. 
And digging it up is not going to change the fact that it's already happened. 
You think about it. 
Well, l can't say this gig doesn't have its benefits. 
Dude, you're lucky. lf Gaines caught you 
with her... Bang! You're dead. 
Yeah, well, Gaines didn't catch me, did he? Come on. 
So, how long you been working with Gaines? 
l don't know. On and off, a couple of months. 
 ls he good for his word? 
 What do you mean? 
ls he going to pay me, let me go, if l do what he wants? 
 Sure. 
 l don't know. 
l get the feeling he doesn't like me. 
Here. Here you go. 
Yeah. He gets uptight when he's on a job. 
But he's really pretty chilly. 
 You do the job, you'll be OK. 
 Cool. 
So how was she? Sweet? 
Yeah, she was OK. 
Well, she's pretty hot. 
Might wanna dip in myself. 
What about the lecture you just gave me? 
Aren't we supposed to be loading the trucks? 
All right. Let's go. 
Gaines really wants to get this done. 
 (Rick) What are we loading? 
 Everything. We're cleaning the place out. 
Oh, man, my keys. l'll catch up with you. 
 Did anyone see you? 
 No. We're cool. 
When we get to the fence you'll see a cluster of trees. 
That's where we wanna be. Ready? 
Yeah. Let's go. 
(Teri) Hi. Hi. 
 Mrs Bauer? 
 Yes, hi. Teri. 
 Charles McLemore, CTU. 
 You guys got here fast. 
 They told us it was urgent. 
 Someone's got my daughter. 
This man knows where she is. 
Has anyone been in touch with Jack yet? 
This guy's dangerous. What are you doing? 
No! No! 
 Let's hurry this up. We're way behind. 
 No! No! 
Put her in the car. 
Jamey. 
 What's up? 
 Got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting? 
l haven't checked. Why? 
Nina was supposed to brief me, but she's not back yet or on her cell. 
Plus there's nothing on my screen about it. 
lt's not coming up on mine either, but that doesn't mean anything. 
The lockdown made the system glitchy. 
That's probably why the meeting's not posting. 
lt's strange, the way she and Jack left. 
 Something happened in his office. 
 What were you doing? Spying on them? 
Pull the security video from Jack's office. 
l'm not authorised to do that. 
l'm authorising you. 
Jack and Nina aren't here. l got rank. 
 Yeah, but... 
 Give me ten minutes, starting at 6.30. 
Send it to my screen. 
 Where are we going? 
 Turn right. 
Turn right. 
All night you've been giving me this line that somebody in the agency wants Palmer dead, that your daughter's missing, that no one can be trusted, not even me. 
ls it all a lie, Jack, or just some of it? 
What was on the key card that you didn't want us to find? 
Please, Nina, don't make this harder than it is. 
You've got a gun on me, Jack. 
l don't see how it gets much worse. 
Stay on Jefferson. 
ln about three miles you'll see a turn-off. 
Keep going straight. 
To think that l ever trusted you, Jack. 
 That l defended you. 
 Watch out! 
Careful, Jack. 
l need you alive. 
Come on. Let's go. 
(Jack) Stop the car. 
What is this place, Jack? 
What are we doing here? 
 Somebody followed us. 
 l know. 
 Who are they? 
 What do you want me to do here? 
 What? 
 Take her out and shoot her. 
 No. 
 Your choice, Jack. Nina or your daughter. 
Jack, l don't understand. 
Why are you doing this? 
Get out of the car. 
Get out of the car! 
Get out of the car. Get out of the car! 
 Jack, what...? 
 l'm sorry, Nina. 
What are you gonna do? 
What are you gonna do? 
 Ow! You're gonna kill me right here? 
 l have no choice. They have Kim and Teri. 
How do you know they won't kill them even if you do this? 
 l can't take that chance. 
 What about me? 
Enough chitchat. Just do it. 
Kimberly's dead if you don't do it! 
 Forgive me. 
 You think l'm messing with you? 
 Turn around. Turn around! 
 No. No. 
 lf you do it, do it to my face. 
 Shoot her! 
 l won't make this easy for... 
 (gunshots) Get back in the car, Jack. 
 What do we do when we get out? 
 We have to get to the road. 
Highway 14's about a mile away, and l know how to get there. You ready? 
Yeah. 
(woman screaming)  What's the matter? 
 (Teri) Oh, my God! Where's my daughter? 
 (Teri) ls she here? 
 That's my mom. 
 We can't wait. We gotta go. 
 l can't just leave her there. 
Kimberly! ls my daughter here? 
 What have you done with her? 
 We gotta go! 
l can't. 
Get down. Kim, if we get out, we can help her. 
We can call the police. 
You go. Call my dad. 
(guard) Yeah, right there. 
You just blew our only chance to get outta here. Let's go. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Stop it! Kimberly! 
The polls are about to open in California, which is a key state for the Palmer campaign. 
Earlier polls show the senator leading by a 15 per cent margin. 
Assuming voting follows predictions, the senator... 
Jack, you son of a bitch. 
Why'd he give her a flak jacket? 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day ofmy life. 
Listen up, people. Listen up! 
Alexis Drazen was leaving for a meeting. 
At this meeting he was gonna make a payoff. 
So somewhere in this room there is money. 
l want it found and l want it found now. 
 Elizabeth can't be held responsible for this. 
 l don't disagree. 
But we have a tape of her plunging a letter opener into a man's stomach. 
 You got her into this. 
 No, sir, l did not. 
l did not ask her to stab Alexis Drazen. 
l misjudged her ability to handle the stress of this, and as l said, l will do all l can to help. 
l know you're just trying to protect me. 
Senator, l understand the situation that you're in. 
But l do not need to remind you that there are at least two suspects at large. 
Sir, please, l implore you. Have as much 
security around you as you can tolerate, and let us do our job. 
 Keep me posted. 
 Yes, sir. l promise l will. 
(Nina) They need to bag all this as evidence. 
 (Nina) OK. All this needs to be included. 
 15 minutes, team. Gotta be ready to go. 
 (man) Bingo. 
 (Nina) Found it! 
 What? 
 Bearer bonds. 
As good as cash and easier to move. 
Got the address of the restaurant yet? 
 California Plaza. lt's 20 minutes from here. 
 Good. 
How are you gonna pull this off? 
Pretending to be Alexis? 
l don't know yet. Hey, Jake. 
Jake, come here. Give me your shirt. 
 l'm going with you. Coordinate your backup. 
 Fine. 
 What's the update on Bauer's family? 
 Still missing. 
Anything back from forensics yet? 
Based on preliminary reports, it looks like the agents were killed protecting the women. 
We have to find the wife and daughter. 
l alerted a task force over at District. 
Call and see if they need anything else from our end. 
 All right. 
 Tony? 
Still no word to Jack on any of this, understand? 
What do you want me to tell him if he calls and asks? 
Tell him you're workin' on somethin' else and put him through to me, all right? 
What are you lookin' for? 
Whoever Dan was working for might have information about my mom. 
This guy who was in charge - Gaines? 
l'd never met him before. Dan knew him. 
 Maybe his number's here. 
 What are you gonna do? 
Call him and ask for your mom back? 
Any information l find, l'm gonna give it to the police. 
You hear that, Rick? She's gonna 
call the police. ls that OK with you? 
 l thought you said you don't trust the police. 
 Whatever. l'll give it to my dad. 
Dan'll go ballistic when he finds out you guys have been going through his stuff. 
 You didn't tell her Dan's dead? 
 Not yet. l don't wanna freak her out. 
Besides, Dan's brother Frank is on his way here and l don't want him to know. 
 Don't say anything, OK? 
 OK. 
(Kim sighs) This is such a waste of time. 
We're never gonna find anything. 
l don't even know why l came. 
You're married. 
You have a daughter named Kimberly. 
 l have a daughter? 
 Yes. 
A teenage daughter. 
You and Jack, you were separated about six months ago. That's when we met. 
 Who are you? 
 l'm a friend. 
A very good friend... 
 who wanted to be a lot more. 
 But... 
You were afraid to start a relationship, so we didn't. 
Then you decided to go back with your husband. 
Maybe it was because of Kimberly. 
l don't know. 
But you asked me not to call, and l haven't. 
l... l don't remember any of this. 
We need to get you to a hospital, have you looked at. 
 Why? You said you were a doctor. 
 l'm a surgeon. You need a neurologist. 
 You've suffered some trauma. 
 l don't wanna go to a hospital. 
 Why not? 
 l don't know. l just don't want to. 
What if l examined you here? 
OK. 
(Carl) There is some physical evidence in George Ferragamo's office that leads directly to you. 
Subtle enough so the fire marshals didn't find it the first time. 
But with a little help, they'll find it. 
 (Keith) So l'll be framed for his murder? 
 Like l said, whatever it takes. 
l don't know what you think you got. 
What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb admitting that he set my son up for murder. 
lt's a while since l've practised law, but l know that unless Keith was sanctioned by a court order and prepped by an authority, this is not evidence. 
l've been in politics long enough to know that if the media gets hold of this tape, the truth will come out. 
No. Today can't be about two things, David. 
lt's either about winning the primary, securing the party nomination, or it's about a political scandal, but it can't be about both. 
 Destroy the tape. 
 What? 
lf you don't, not only will you bring down yourself, but you'll bring the entire party down. 
 How do l do that? 
 Because you're gonna win today. 
You'll have enough delegates by eight o'clock. 
You are the Democratic Party's candidate for president, whether you like it or not. 
And if you decide to self-destruct, it will take years for the party's platform to recover. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't we 
let the electorate decide on that? 
And l don't consider telling the truth self-destructive. 
And how bad will it be for the Democrats if somebody else comes out with this first and l have to go on the defensive? 
What do you think, Mike? 
l've seen much uglier stories kept under wraps. 
The only people who know about this tape are the people in this room and Keith. 
This would not be a difficult item to shelve. 
And besides, this is currency. 
Once you get into the White House, this could protect you. 
 How? 
 Well, think about it. 
You'll have evidence against some of the most powerful men in the country. 
They won't be able to control you, David. 
 Tony, it's Jack. How's everything going? 
 Fine. 
l need to speak to Mason. 
He's not in his office. 
 He's on the floor. Let me transfer you. 
 OK. Wait. 
Before you do, have you spoken to Teri yet? 
 No. 
 Give me the number ofthe safe house. 
 l'll call over there myself. 
 Look, let me see if l can get that for you. 
Hang on a second. 
 What's up? 
 Jack's on the phone. He wants you. 
 OK. 
 And he wants the number of the safe house. 
 Of course he does. 
 Look... 
 Why not tell him what happened? 
 Why is this so difficult to comprehend? 
The man is neck-deep in an investigation. 
He has a job to do. Let's let him do it. 
We get him to a controlled environment, we can tell him. Meanwhile, we have a job to do. 
l gotta say, l just think it's wrong. 
lt's not about right and wrong. lt's about the 
fact that we have a priority to protect Palmer. 
He's on line two. 
 Jack, it's me. Where are you? 
 We're on our way to a meet. 
 What kind of meet? 
 Alexis was supposed to make a payoff. 
 A payoff to who? 
 l'm not sure yet. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 Pretend to be Alexis. 
Oh, Jack, you're never gonna pull that off. 
Alexis was supposed to pay this guy $50,000 in bearer bonds. 
George, you're gonna have to work with me on this. l need backup. 
Milo's got the address. 
We should be there in about 15 minutes. 
You keep this guy in play, we got a chance of bringing these guys down. 
Otherwise you can wait for Alexis to come to, ifhe comes to. By then this could be over. 
 All right. l'll go along. l'll send you a team. 
 Thank you. 
Can you pass me to Tony? He was gonna 
give me the number for the safe house. 
Yeah. l just spoke to Paulson over there. 
He said the girls were sleeping. 
OK. Um, get them to call me back 
on my cell when they wake up. 
 Definitely. 
 Thank you. 
 Mason's on board. 
 Oh, that's good. 
 So what else did Teri say? 
 She didn't say much. 
Once she guessed that you'd been seeing me, she didn't wanna talk to me. 
Not that l blame her. 
But l couldn't finish the debrief. 
l left and let Paulson do it. 
Maybe that was a mistake. 
No. You did the right thing. 
This is my fault. l should have told her. 
 Sounds like she didn't wanna talk about it. 
 Doesn't matter. l still should have told her. 
Jack, from what l could see, she really loves you and wants to work it out. 
 Maybe you wanna call and see how she is. 
 l tried. Mason said they were sleeping. 
You know, why don't you call Paulson and see if they're up yet? 
 lt's not going through. 
 lt might be the area. 
Try again when we get to the plaza. 
Look, l'm really sorry about all this. 
Yeah, me too. 
(Mason) Hanlin? No. 
Come on, guys. Do what you can. 
At least try to find somebody else, huh? 
Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 l need extra bodies to help track the Bauers. 
l don't know. l don't see anyone 
doing crossword puzzles here. 
Look, uh, my hands are a little tied without Nina here. 
Cos Nina's with Jack, right? 
Yeah. 
She says it's over between them. 
What do you think? 
 What? 
 No, l'm just asking. 
You gotta be wondering yourself, right? 
Hey, Almeida. l'm on your side. 
Nina oughta be here right now. 
What does Jack need her for? 
You bust your ass with no resources because she's with him. lf that works for you, great. 
You know what works for me? You keeping 
out of my personal business. OK? 
Know what? There's entirely too much 
personal business going on around here. 
l wanna get this place back on track. 
 lt seems Nina is a big part of the problem. 
 How do you figure that? 
She covers for everyone that doesn't follow code. And they cover for her. 
She's with Jack. She's with you. 
You don't think that's relevant? 
You don't think that's a distraction? 
 No, l don't. 
 No, you don't. Well, l do. 
 Patty said you wanted to talk to me, Dad. 
 Yeah. Sit down. Close the door. 
What's up? 
Before l make my decision about giving this tape to the DA, l wanted to talk to you. 
OK. 
l wanted you to understand what you're up against. 
 l understand, Dad. l'm ready to go. 
 No, no, no. 
Listen to me. 
We're going to the press with a story about some bad men committing murder and trying to frame you. 
But these men are going to shift the attention to you and your involvement with Lyle Gibson's death. 
Ultimately, they're gonna make this about you. 
On television, in the press, everywhere you go. 
You're gonna be accused of a crime you did not commit. 
 Can you live through that? 
 Yes, l can. 
Don't just say it. 
Think about it. 
Dad... 
What do you think l've been living through? 
Not just today, but for years? 
l made a mistake. 
l was wrong to go to Mom and Carl. 
l should have come forward right away. 
Taken my hits right then and there. 
But l was scared. 
That's what you learn. 
lt's OK to be scared. 
What l said last night... 
About you not being there. 
lt's not true. 
lt's, uh... 
what l told myself so l can blame you for my screwup. 
lt doesn't matter why you said it. 
The fact is, there's some truth to it. 
l haven't always been there. 
But l'm here now. 
 Jovan? 
 Yes, Andre? 
l can't find Alexis. Have you heard from him? 
 No. 
 He's meeting Morgan in 20 minutes. 
 l need to talk to him. 
 l don't know, Andre. 
 l've got my own situation to deal with. 
 Still no sign of the women? 
 l'll find them. 
 You checked the hospitals? 
l checked everywhere. l don't need 
you looking over my shoulder! 
l'll find them and kill them. 
Don't worry about it. 
Calm down, and don't tell me not to worry. 
Just tell me how you plan to find them. 
l'm going to the Bauer house. 
Eventually, someone will show. 
 Aunt Ethel isn't there. 
 Anyone else? 
l've tried everyone l can think of. 
No one's heard from my mom. 
 Rick. We got things to do. She's gotta go. 
 What kind of things? 
 You'll find out when Frank gets here. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Kim's in trouble. l gotta help her. 
 We'll be in trouble too. 
 Look, she has to leave. 
 OK. That's fine. 
Kim, wait. Wait. 
Hey, look. l just need to talk to her 
for a second, then she'll go. 
Where are you gonna go? 
There's a park my mom said to go in an emergency, like an earthquake. 
 Maybe she's there. 
 Why don't you just go to your house? 
The people that are after us must know where l live. 
 lf she's safe, she's not gonna go there. 
 This park. How will you get there? 
l don't know. Um... 
Can l borrow your car? 
(sighs) lt's not mine, it's Melanie's. 
Wait a minute. 
Here. Take this. You can usually catch a cab 
on Fourth. lt's a couple of blocks this way. 
 Sure you can't come with me? 
 After last night, l gotta lay low. 
They're gonna be looking for me. 
l still think you should turn yourself in. 
lt's not that bad. You helped us escape. 
l'm on probation. 
They catch me, l'm going to prison. 
lt doesn't matter what you or your folks say. 
l wish we would have met before this. 
So do l. 
Are you gonna be OK? 
Yeah. 
l wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you. 
You wouldn't be in trouble if it wasn't for me. 
That's not true. 
Dan would have found someone else. 
 Hey, Rick. 
 Hey. 
 So, how'd it go last night? 
 lt went fine. 
Yeah? 
 Don't look fine. What happened to you? 
 Nothin'. l'm OK. 
Hey, Dan! Dan! 
 Go. Get outta here. Grab a cab on Fourth. 
 l know. 
 Where's my brother? 
 He's out. 
 Out where? 
 We got separated. 
 Uhhuh. So where's the money? 
 He's got it. 
Uh-huh. 
 l should get going. 
 Where are you going? 
 What do you mean? 
 l don't know you. 
 My name's Kim. 
 Hi, Kim. How do you know Rick? 
She's a friend from San Diego. 
She's gotta get home. 
 She's not going anywhere. 
 What's that mean? 
My brother's not here, nor is my money, and l don't know her. 
 She's a friend. 
 l got business going down in half an hour. 
Until Dan gets back with the money, nobody leaves. 
(Nina) OK, the teams will be in hidden positions here, here, here and here. 
 (Jack) Communications? 
 On the same channel as us. 
 Exits? 
 They'll be covered by the teams, but l'll add one here at the widest exit. 
 (phone rings)  OK, good. 
 Yeah? 
 Jack, you all set up? 
 Yeah. The team's in place? 
 Yeah. That's what l wanted to call you about. 
 Teddy Hanlin's running backup. 
 What? 
Don't freak out. l'm sure it'll be fine. 
Just avoid a confrontation. 
 Dammit. How could you let this happen? 
 l'm sorry. l just found out about it. 
 Division made the assignment. 
 l understand. Fine, l'll deal with it. 
 l don't believe this. 
 What? 
 Teddy Hanlin's in charge of backup. 
 Seth Campbell's old partner? 
 Yeah. 
 Great. Who are you calling? 
The safe house. l wanna make sure Teri 
and Kim are all right before this gets started. 
 No one's picking up. ls this number right? 
 lt's the one Paulson gave me. 
 Why can't l get through? 
 Jack. 
Hey, Jack. Haven't seen you 
since you put my partner away. 
 Teddy, don't start. 
 Teddy, is your team in place? 
Yeah. We're not up here shopping for 
Dockers. l heard you really screwed up today. 
l guess some people have connections and don't get spanked when they break the law. 
The guy we're looking for is wearing a red cap. That's all we know. 
l'll stay visible, hopefully draw him to me. 
No one makes a move until l give the word. ls that clear? 
lt's your show. 
Just make sure you stay put when you do. 
l always get a bit nervous about target confusion, and l'd hate to see one of the good guys go down by mistake. 
Teddy. Let's get started, OK? 
Hey. l don't want a problem on this. 
Hey. l got a call from the Rampart Division. 
A woman matching Teri Bauer's description was seen wandering around Griffith Park. 
 You know, it's not far from the safe house. 
 Where is she? 
 She disappeared. 
 All right. l'll get on the satellite uplink. 
 Post someone at the Bauer house. 
 l did. 
 Williams should be there in a few minutes. 
 Good work. 
l don't like what l'm seeing. Looks like 
you've been roughed up by someone. 
Do you think maybe that l hit my head, that that's why l can't remember? 
That's just it. 
There's no evidence of a head injury. 
Except for the memory loss, you're coherent. 
Beside the bruises, do you have any pain? 
Yeah. 
Something's been bothering me, sort of here. 
Oh, my God. What... 
What do you think happened to me? 
l don't know. 
But l... l think you have a condition. 
lt's called dissociative amnesia. 
lt can happen to someone when they suffer an intense emotional trauma. 
We need to get you to a hospital so they can figure out what's going on. 
No, l... l don't wanna do that. l... 
l can't explain it, but for some reason l just... 
l don't wanna go to a hospital. l just have 
this gut feeling that it would be dangerous. 
How could it be dangerous? l'd be with you. 
l'd be by your side the entire time. 
 Come on. lt'll be fine. 
 No. l don't wanna go. 
Teri, we can't stay here. 
You need to get checked out. 
Neural damage can become permanent if it's not treated right away. 
 No, l don't wanna go. 
 Come on. 
l don't wanna go. 
l don't wanna go to the hospital. 
Please don't make me go. l can't do it. 
l'm sorry, but l can't. 
l don't wanna go to the hospital. 
 OK. 
 l can't go. 
OK. 
 Please, Phil. Just take me home. 
 OK. 
lt's OK. lt's all right. 
Right. l heard. 
No. No, we did much better in New York 
than we thought. Oh, yeah, definitely. 
(Palmer) Put this in my safe now. 
Oh, yeah. That'll make him very happy. 
Oh, l think so, too. 
Oh, DNC, they'll really milk it. 
Uh-huh. 
Yeah. 
Well, l... l'm not sure, but... 
Well, that's good, though. 
No, l spoke to Chris. 
l told him we'd be in Baltimore if we won New York. Mm-hm. 
Right. 
Mm-hm. 
Yeah. Jerry? 
Jerry, listen. l gotta run. 
We'll touch base in a couple of hours, OK? 
Well, how are Beth and the girls? 
That's terrific. All righty. Bye-bye. 
Uh, Patty. Do you know where David went? 
Just to the conference room. He and Mike 
are meeting the publicist for tonight. 
 Did he say how long he'd be? 
 Um... he didn't say. 
Shouldn't be about more than 15, 20 minutes. 
 OK. Hm. Hey, did you hear about New York? 
 Oh, yeah. lsn't it great? 
 Oh. There you are. Jerry's on the line... 
 l'm busy. 
 He said he just wanted to... 
 Well, l'm busy, Patty. 
 Tell him l'll call him back. 
 OK. 
Oh, come on, Dan. 
 Where's Keith? 
 l don't know. 
 l heard, uh, you two had a talk. 
 Yes, we did. 
 You should talk to him too. 
 Really? About what? 
Well, we're putting him in a tough place. 
He's gonna need both our support. 
No, David. You're the one 
who's put him in a tough place. 
And as for needing us, our... our baby left the nest a long time ago. 
l don't think he cares to hear what l have to say. 
That's ridiculous. Speak to him, Sherry. 
l destroyed it. 
 You destroyed the tape? 
 Mmhm. 
And l know you're gonna be angry, but it had to be done. 
You have blinders on. 
You're not seeing this thing very clearly. 
lt's for the best. 
lt breaks my heart that l was right. 
Right about what, David? 
That wasn't the real tape, Sherry. 
l've learned that l don't know you as well as l thought l did. 
l had to see just how far you were willing to go. 
l will do anything to protect my family, David. 
Anything. 
Does that make me a bad person? 
 Set up a press conference. 
 When? 
 Now. 
 We've got one in less than three hours. 
 l want this one within the hour. 
 Where? 
Downstairs. l don't want anyone or anything 
to interfere with what l have to say. 
 Nina, l'm on channel one. Do you copy? 
 Yeah, l hearyou, Jack. The signal's good. 
 Where are you posted? 
 Under the east entrance, under the bridge. 
Good. How about you, Teddy? 
My teams are in position. 
OK. l got you. 
You're blocking my view, Jack. 
Take a couple of steps back. 
 How's that? 
 There you go. 
Perfect shot. 
(Jack) OK. 
 There you go, ma'am. 
 Oh, thank you. 
You're a very sensitive guy, Jack. 
l've never seen that side of you. 
Drop it, Teddy. We're working. 
Jack can walk and chew gum at the same time, can't you, Jack? 
 What do you want? 
 Nothin'. lt's just that we're both so busy. 
We never really get a chance to talk. 
Did you hear about Seth Campbell's wife, Judy? 
 No, what about her? 
 She hung herself. 
Yeah. Happened a couple ofweeks ago. 
l guess you didn't get the memo, huh? 
lt was a real tragedy. 
She didn't even bother leavin' a note. 
l guess she thought it was kinda obvious. 
Tryin' to raise four kids with a husband in prison and no pension. 
Cos why, Jack? You busted him for 
linin' his pocket with a few extra dollars. 
Look, l'm sorry about Judy and l'm sorry about his kids, but this is not the time. 
That's right. You're busy. 
 Can this wait, Teddy? 
 Uh, of course. 
l just thought it'd be nice, you know, to catch up, while we're hangin'. 
Teddy, l understand why you're upset. 
As soon as this is over, l'll be happy to sit down and tell you my side of the story. 
l'd really like to hear your side of the story, Jack. 
Tell you what, why don't we go to a Starbucks, get a couple of cappuccinos, and we can have a little chinwag? 
 CTU, Mason. 
 George, we have a problem. 
 What? 
 Teddy's on the channel hassling Jack. 
He's got a rifle, and it's crawling with people here. 
lt's too late. This is going down any minute. 
 We have to do something. 
 What channel are you on? 
 Channel one. 
 All right. Hang on. 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 Tony, conference me in on channel one. 
Uh, sure. 
Hanlin, it's Mason. 
What the hell's the matter with you? 
You got a problem with Jack, bury it. 
You realise how many agents we lost today? 
You're in an uncontained environment over there. 
 So let's get on the same page now, huh? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Jack, you OK? 
 Yeah. 
OK. Let's get back to work. 
(phone rings) (Frank) Hello? Yeah, man, it's cool. 
He'll be here. 
(car draws up) (car door shuts) CTU, this is Williams. 
l've arrived at the Bauer house. 
l'm checking the perimeter. 
 ls this my neighbourhood? 
 Not quite. 
We'll be there soon. 
Rick says he and Dan got separated. 
He'll be here soon. 
He knows we need the cash by seven. 
 What happens when Dan doesn't show up? 
 l don't know. 
 l'm not gonna tell him his brother's dead. 
 Why? You didn't do it. 
 He's gonna find out. 
 Not from me. 
 (Kim sighs)  What? 
 l don't understand. 
 Neither do l. Doing this deal is suicide. 
l'm not talking about the deal. 
l'm talking about you. 
 What do you mean? 
 You have so much going for you. 
You're smart, you're good-looking, you're funny. How did you end up like this? 
 l'm doing all right. 
 All right? You're wanted by the police. 
You got shot in the arm. Your friends 
that you hang out with are criminals. 
 Do you really wanna end up here? 
 l do the best l can. l didn't grow up like you. 
That's just an excuse. 
l have a friend named Todd. 
He went through two foster homes. 
He's got a scholarship to Stanford now. 
 Good for Todd. Why not go to his house? 
 He can't help me find my mom. 
Neither can l. 
l know you're right. And if l get the chance, 
l'll try to turn myself around. 
But right now this thing is what it is, and we've gotta get through it. 
Get through this? This is crazy. You can't let 
Frank make a drug deal without any money. 
We won't get through this. 
We'll get stuck in the middle of it. 
 You have to talk to him, Rick. 
 Hey, stud. Think fast. 
Thanks. So, what deal? 
We're gonna take the 20 grand you made last night and buy some ecstasy. 
 Dan didn't tell you? 
 No. 
l'm gonna flip it to these guys in Redondo. 
They'll pay 50 for it. 
 What happens if Dan doesn't show up? 
 Hey, if Dan says he'll be here, he'll be here. 
Someone get these kids out of here. 
 Station one, that's you. 
 Roger. l'm on it. 
Hold up. l think l got him. 
Hey. 
 Alexis? 
 Yeah. 
 l told you inside the restaurant. 
 We're doing it out here. 
 Why? 
 Because there's a cop inside the restaurant. 
Come on, let's get this over with. 
Fine. 
 Where's the money? 
 First let's go over it again. 
 Over what? 
 What you're supposed to do for me. 
At 7.20 tonight l'm gonna shut down 
the power on grid 26 double G. 
Five minutes later, it comes back up. 
 What else? 
 What do you mean, what else? 
What happened to your accent? 
 You're not Alexis. 
 He's moving. 
Station two, what do you see? 
l got him. 
 l can take him. 
 No! He's not a threat. l can get him. 
Hold your fire. 
He's going for the east bridge. 
 Just cover the exits. 
 l'll just slow him down. 
 Don't shoot. 
 l'm gonna put him down. 
 No. l repeat, do not shoot. Nobody shoot. 
 Relax, Jack. 
 l'll just wing him. 
 Do not shoot. 
(Jack) Teddy, stand down! 
(Jack) No! 
Stay back! Stay back! 
Get me a medic down here now! 
Hanlin, you son of a bitch, l said don't shoot! 
(Palmer) Take care of this. 
(Nina) Stay back! 
Suspect down. l repeat, suspect is down. 
l need EMTs at the east end of the plaza. 
This is your house. 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life. 
Last night l received a phone call regarding my son, Keith, and my daughter, Nicole. 
That call has unfortunately set offa chain ofevents that has culminated in a tragedy. 
(Phil) l'm your friend - you told me so yourself  so you're gonna have to trust myjudgment. 
 Your daughter. Where is she? 
 l don't know. 
 (Rick) Whatyou gonna do? 
 (Frank) What do you think? 
You're gonna rip 'em off. 
 Where's the money? 
 l got your money. All right, stand down! 
 What you gonna do now, man? Kill us? 
 Yeah. 
You have the right to remain silent. 
(Kim screams) Arrest all of 'em. 
 (Mason) Where you headed? 
 (Jack) Saugus. 
Alexis paid this guy to knock the power out at a specific address. l wanna know why. 
Correct me if l'm wrong, but this day basically boils down to a personal vendetta against you and Palmer by the Drazens. 
Yes. 
Any ideas on why the Serbs'd wanna spend this much money to turn the power off in the middle of the woods? 
Someone knows we're here. 
Jack, l take back what l said. 
lt's getting dull. 
 That helicopter made a flyby for a reason. 
 Maybe, maybe not. 
Come here and help me with this. 
One, two, three. 
There's nothin' here. We're wasting our time. 
Alexis tried to pay a power-company official to cut off the electricity at 7.20 for a reason. 
There's something here that they want. 
(phone rings) Mason. 
Excellent news. Half an hour. OK, 
don't let anyone in or out until we get there. 
Alexis Drazen just got out of surgery. 
We ought to be there. 
 You go ahead. 
 Jack, we were fed misinformation. 
The address in the file, the time Morgan gave you, the whole thing. 
 Look around. There's nothin' here. Nothin'. 
 Maybe. 
But you're gonna stick around anyway. 
lt's three minutes after seven, George. 
l wanna be here at 7.20. 
Look, you can send a car back for me, OK? 
l promise l won't disappear on you. 
l don't have time to argue with you. 
Oh, my God! 
Stay right here. Stay right there, Teri. 
 Who the hell was that guy? 
 l don't know. 
(Teri sobs) Teri? Teri, it's OK. l'm right here. 
lt's OK. 
Teri, listen to me, take a breath. 
l can't. l can't! 
l saw the car explode. There was nothing left! 
Hey. Hey! Kim is alive. 
She got out before the explosion. 
l talked to her. 
She was fine. She was worried about you. 
Now, l need your help. 
l need to get you back to CTU. Come on. 
 Oh, my God. 
 l need your help, Teri. Come on. 
What did she say? 
What did she say when you talked to her? 
 Where is she? 
 We don't know. She wouldn't tell us. 
After the safe house, she didn't trust us. 
l don't blame her. 
 We have to find her! Tony, we have to... 
 Believe me, we're looking. Get in the car! 
Where's Jack? 
Does he know what's happening? 
He's out on an assignment. 
l should hear from him soon, though. 
(dials phone) (phone rings)  Myers. 
 lt's me. l found Teri at the Bauer house. 
Somebody tried to kill her, but l took him down. Send a team in case he's got backup. 
 ls she all right? 
 She will be. 
She seems to have suffered some temporary memory loss. She's got a friend with her, too. 
 l guess a good one by the way he's acting. 
 Wait. Are you sure? Who is this guy? 
His name's Phil Parslow. She vouches for 
him. Apparently she's known him a long time. 
 He was hit, but not too badly. 
 OK. Where are you now? 
20, 30 minutes away. 
Take him to the clinic. l'll send someone 
to question him. Bring Teri here. 
OK. 
 (Kim) Don't l get a phone call? 
 Lock 'em down. Come on. 
 Look, l need to talk to someone. 
 Yeah, don't we all! 
Don't listen to the bitch. She lies. 
You're gonna get a chance for that after we put you through. Come with me. You're mine. 
They're gonna ask you about Frank... 
and the deal. 
l don't know about Frank or the deal. 
Tell 'em that. You were just 
at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
l think l should tell them about everything else, too. l mean, what happened today. 
After the safe house, l'm not sure if l can trust anybody. 
 You trust me, right? 
 Yeah, and look where it got me. 
Yes, l trust you, and l know you're trying to do the right thing. 
OK, then listen to me. Tell 'em everything. 
What happened at the safe house has nothin' to do with this. 
Whatever you tell them, l'll back it up. 
lncluding my part in it. 
 You're gonna get in trouble. 
 Then l'll get in trouble. 
lt's about time l faced up to what l did. 
All right. 
You're up. 
How are you feelin'? 
l'm fine, Daddy. 
Relieved, actually. 
l think that maybe... living with a secret 
is harder work than l thought. 
l'd be lying to you if l told you the hard work was over. 
You're gonna be asked some questions  we all are - that we'd rather not deal with. 
But if we stick together, we'll get through it. 
(door opens) Would you give your mother and me a few minutes? 
l'm sorry. 
l, uh... 
didn't mean to interrupt your... celebration. 
You could've joined it. 
Well, l'm not in the mood to celebrate the end of your campaign, David. 
 You just gave your concession speech. 
 That remains to be seen. 
Do you really think people want a president who acts like some guest on a bad afternoon talk show, confessing his sins publicly? 
lt's always possible that they want someone honest. 
 Mike seems to think l still have a shot. 
 lt's his job to tell you what you wanna hear. 
Mine... is to tell you the truth. 
You're not qualified to tell me the truth. 
lt took 13 minutes for you to tear apart everything that it took us 25 years to build. 
Why don't you just let me mourn that loss, OK? 
Fair enough. 
l only hope your conscience comforts you when you finally realise this is all over. 
You mean the campaign or us? 
 Confirm, Alpha One. 
 This is Alpha One. 
 Bauer's gone below. 
 Positive it was Bauer? 
Yes. 
 What's he doing here? 
 He wasn't invited, that's for sure. 
(alarm) (door opens)  My name is Jack Bauer, and l work for C... 
 CTU. 
l know who you are. l checked you out. 
My name is DeSalvo. DOD. 
Whatever this place is, it's obvious that no one's supposed to know it's here. 
Well, you seem to have found it OK. 
This is a prison facility - class-three detention centre. So what the hell are you doin' here? 
At 8am this morning there was an assassination attempt on Senator Palmer. 
l'm the lead investigator. l was following 
a thread. The thread led me here. 
l need more than that. 
The people that want Palmer dead bribed someone from the power company to shut down the electricity to the grid you're hooked into. 
They were ordered to do this at 7.20. 
Something's gonna happen here then, isn't it? 
Mr DeSalvo, you better listen to me. 
The people that are behind this assassination attempt are ex-military Serbs. 
They work for the Drazen family. 
They've killed a lot of people today, and they'll kill a lot more unless we do something. So, sir, l will ask one more time. 
What is happening here at 7.20? 
 A prisoner is being delivered by chopper. 
 Who? 
His identity's classified even from me. 
They move him every few weeks. 
What do these... Drazens 
want with him, anyway? 
lt's hard to tell unless l know who the prisoner is. 
They might wanna kill him, they might wanna set him free. 
Either way, you got about five minutes. 
You'd better call for backup. 
 Backup can't get here in five minutes. 
 Call anyway. 
lf l'm wrong, you've gone through a little trouble. l'll take the heat. 
lf l'm right, you've potentially saved every life in this building. 
Please. 
(dials phone) Yeah, have Wykoff call me ASAP. 
Thank you. What's your personnel here? 
Three guards, plus a maintenance man, two technicians. 
 Are they weaponstrained? 
 No, the civilians have never fired a weapon. 
The Drazens don't know that. lssue them 
full service gear. Have them stand by. 
 To do what, exactly? 
 To make this place look more secure. 
At least until backup arrives. 
lt's almost time. Three minutes. 
 You still haven't heard from your brother? 
 No. 
He didn't verify meeting the man from the power company. 
lf there was a problem, he would've called. 
You seem anxious, Harris. l thought 
professionals didn't get anxious. 
Professionals get very anxious when a plan goes off the tracks. 
 There's nothing wrong. 
 Then what's Bauer doing here? 
Just get your men ready. lt's time. 
Hey. Come here. 
 No. Like this. 
 (DeSalvo) All right, let's get moving. 
Keep your stock in tight, keep your weapon down. You're gonna be all right. 
 Any word on the backup? 
 They're lookin' into it. 
Weapon. 
 We good? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Let's go. 
 All right. 
(helicopter approaches) Put your men in front of the lights so they can be seen! 
Form a line right in front of the lights! 
Look like you're ready for somethin'. 
45 seconds. 
You said there'd be a warden and three guards. l count eight, including Bauer. 
 They're expecting us, Andre. 
 Doesn't matter. 
The power's going down in 25 seconds. 
The sudden darkness will disorient them. 
 What if there is no darkness? 
 There will be. 
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
Eight more seconds. 
Five... four... 
three... two... one. 
 The perimeter lights are still on. 
 Dammit! 
 All right, we're still going. 
 No. Security is twice what we anticipated. 
The lights are on. We'll be cut to pieces. 
 Get ready to move. 
 We have to stand down. 
 My money, my decision. 
 My crew. They'll obey my orders. 
 All right. 
 Plans have changed. Stand down. 
 Sit down. 
 My father is Jack Bauer. 
Sit. 
He's the director of the Los Angeles bureau of CTU. 
 Counter Terrorist Unit. Have you heard of it? 
 l can't say that l have. 
Do you want the number? 
Look, what l want is information on Frank Allard and his plans to buy and distribute 1,000 hits of ecstasy. That's it. 
l don't know him. l met him 
for the first time a couple of hours ago. 
Do you know that someone tried to kill David Palmer this morning? 
 Yeah. 
 Aren't you curious how l know about it? 
l don't know. Maybe because 
it's been on the news the last 12 hours. 
l didn't realise. l was kidnapped. By the same 
people who were tryin' to kill Senator Palmer. 
l know this sounds crazy, but they kidnapped my mother and tried to get my father to help them, but he rescued us. 
Then he dropped you off at Frankie's so you could earn spending money dealing drugs? 
No. No. They brought us to a safe house, 
but it was attacked, and l think they captured my mother again. 
OK. You know, she told me you had 
an active imagination. She wasn't kidding. 
 Who? 
 Your friend. The one we picked you up with. 
 Melanie? 
 Mmhm. 
No! No. She's not my friend. 
She thinks l'm after her boyfriend. 
You can't believe anything she says about me. 
l'm gonna stick you back in the holding cell. 
Maybe it'll convince you not to screw around. 
Call this number. Tell them that l am 
Jack Bauer's daughter and that l'm here. 
Ask them if they think l'm screwing around. 
Come on. 
Wait. Just because they haven't attacked yet 
doesn't mean they're not going to. 
Maybe. Maybe this is a crock 
and there's nobody there. 
Drazen's crew is out there. 
They didn't get the power to shut down. 
They're working on their contingency plan. 
Trust me, l know these people. 
 There's not much else l can do. 
 There is. Let me talk to that prisoner. 
No. Access is something l can't give. My 
orders are explicit. l can't even speak to him. 
Everything happening here is connected to the assassination attempt on Senator Palmer. 
lf you do not let me interrogate that prisoner, you're putting the senator's life in danger. 
Listen, Bauer, you are welcome to go over my head if you want, but l can't help you. 
Now, l gotta process this guy. 
 Wait. You said you work for the DOD, right? 
 And? 
Can l borrow your phone? 
l wanna clear every interview Nicole gives. 
Yes, personally. 
Whenever possible, l wanna be there. 
Let me know. 
(Palmer) So, is it as bad as Sherry said it would be? 
..predicted a sharp drop in Senator Palmer's 
numbers, it's not turning out that way. 
lnstant polls indicate that the senator's base of support is holding steady in most areas, and in some cases it's actually increasing. 
When asked if his disclosures made them more likely to vote for him in the election, less likely or made no difference at all, 60 per cent said ''No difference'', 22 per cent said ''More likely'', while only 18 per cent said ''Less likely''. 
(phone rings) Looks like you were right, David. 
..seemed to indicate that voters 
approved of Senator Palmer's honesty before a national television audience a little more than a half-hour ago. 
Senator. lt's a Jack Bauer.  
He says it's urgent. 
Thank you. Jack, it's me. 
Did you get anything from Alexis Drazen? 
No. He's coming out of surgery now, but 
l did follow up a lead we got from his hotel. 
 l'm gonna need your help. 
 Go on. 
l'm at a class-three detention facility. 
lt's a prison that doesn't exist,  and neither does its new prisoner. 
 Who's the prisoner? 
That's where l need your help. 
This is run by the Department of Defense. 
 You want me to pull some strings? 
 l need access to the prisoner. 
The facility's located in Saugus at the address you gave me. 
The warden's name is DeSalvo. 
He's a reasonable guy, but his hands are tied. 
 l'll do what l can. 
 Thank you, sir. 
Come on, you son of a bitch, turn around. 
(voices)  That prisoner's identity is classified! 
 l need to know who that prisoner is. 
No. 
That's impossible. 
You recognise him? 
 That's Victor Drazen. 
 Who is he? 
The man l killed two years ago. 
All right, listen, Bauer. You're asking me 
to risk my job, maybe go to jail. 
l need some quid pro quo. 
What's your connection to this guy? 
What l'm about to tell you is secured information. 
Two years ago a congressional subcommittee decided Victor Drazen was the key threat to the peace in Bosnia. 
So they authorised a mission to take him out. l led that mission. 
When we got there, things went wrong. 
Today l found out that Drazen's wife and daughter were killed in the attack. 
l thought we'd killed Drazen, but apparently l was wrong. 
So now his sons wanna break him out. 
And they wanna exact a revenge on me. 
His people kidnapped my wife and daughter. 
We got them back. They're safe for now. 
But if Drazen escapes, l lose any leverage l've got of keeping his people from my family. 
 l'll make another call. 
 We don't have time for calls. 
We need to take this prisoner and move him ourselves now. 
l said l'll make a call. 
 We still need to cut the power. 
 But your brother hasn't contacted us yet. 
He would have called by now... 
if he were alive. 
We should assume Alexis is dead. 
There may be another way, though. 
The substation for this sector's a half-mile from here. 
A few ounces of C-5 should be sufficient. 
To save time, we'll go in through the front. 
The idea is not to attract attention. 
The idea is to get my father out of prison. 
This is the best chance we'll ever have. 
 These don't match. 
 Uhhuh. 
Hold on. Where's Jack? 
l thought he was with you. 
 He opted to stay in the field. Literally. 
 ln Saugus? 
 Yeah, the address from the Drazen file. 
 Why didn't he come back with you? 
l don't know. He's a stubborn guy. 
He insisted on staying. 
Meanwhile, Alexis Drazen came to at the hospital, so l headed there to interrogate him. 
l cut off his morphine supply, so he should be pretty chatty in about an hour. 
You didn't tell Jack about his family, did you? What are you doing, George? 
What are you doing? The last time l checked, 
it wasn't in my job description to have to explain myself to my subordinates. 
Now, unless they've called off the hit on Palmer's life, you should be working on securing his agenda for the rest of the day. 
Looks like he's going to be our next president. 
(TV) Senator Palmer has carried New York, and with polls closing shortly in California, it now appears that Senator Palmer will maintain his lead... 
Hey. Everyone's outside 
celebrating the latest poll. 
Come on out, sweetheart. 
What is it, David?  
What's wrong now? 
Before, when you said it was over, and l asked you what you meant, the campaign or me... 
What l said came out of wanting to protect my family, wanting to protect you. 
You can't hold that against me. 
Sherry... 
you're an amazing woman. 
Smart, determined, sure of yourself. 
You always know what you want. 
But you don't want me, not really. 
l don't think you've wanted me for a very long time. 
 That's nonsense. 
 ls it? 
Maybe if everything with Nicole and Keith never happened... but it did happen. 
And you kept the truth from me for all these years. 
l don't think you could've done that without pulling away. 
And now... 
now l can't help thinking that l don't trust you any more. 
And if l can't trust you... 
how could l love you? 
Well, David... 
you may not love me, but you will never leave me. 
You take all the time you need to get yourself together and then you come out and you greet all the people who have given up every day and every night of their lives for the last year to put us in office. 
 Us? 
 Yes. 
That's right. Us. 
Because come January, David, when you're being sworn in, make no mistake about it, this woman here will be standing right next to you. 
(male guard) Open up two. 
(catcalling) (female guard) Move away from the door. Now. 
(male guard) OK, Martinez, settle down over there. 
One thing l don't get - if Drazen was the target, then what's he doin' here? 
Someone thought he was better alive than dead. 
By ''someone'', you mean one of our people? 
He's probably been feeding them intelligence. 
Then why put you through the charade of tryin' to kill him? 
Because they wanted the rest of the world to think he was dead. 
My mission was set up to fail from the start. 
l lost every man l went in there with. 
(phone rings) DeSalvo.  
Yeah, he's right here. 
 l understand. 
 We got permission to move Drazen? 
No. That request is still working its way up, 
but DOD says you can interrogate him. 
 Good. 
 Bauer. 
Five minutes. 
Fine. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
You'll have to pardon my surprise. 
l saw you die. 
l watched you enter a building. 
Nobody could've survived that explosion. 
Our intelligence told us the building was empty when you entered. 
Your fight is with me. 
Not my wife, not my daughter, but with me. 
Please... leave my family alone. 
Mr Drazen, you have already lost your wife and your daughter. 
You don't need to lose your sons, too. 
My sons are soldiers. 
Then they will die for nothing. 
We know about the rescue plan. 
lt was scheduled for 7.20. 
We stopped it. We've called in for backup. 
lf they try again, sir, they will die. 
Then you have nothing to worry about. 
 Call it off, Victor. 
 How can l? 
The same way you've been communicating with them this entire time! 
Call it off or your sons will die! 
(buzzer) (door opens) All right.  
We'll move him. 
ls there another way out of here that's not on the schematic? A fire or flood egress? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 l'll get my men ready. 
 Have them armed like we did before. 
Get up. 
GET UP! 
We're evacuating the prisoner. 
Have all personnel convene in quarter C. 
Yes, sir. 
Stop. 
(applause)  (DeSalvo) Move out. 
 (Jack) Let's go. 
Get against the wall. 
 The power's down in the west quadrant. 
 (man) Copy that. 
They are here. 
Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My teenage daughter is missing. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer. 
Today is going to be the longest day ofmy life. 
(reporter) lt is 7am on the West Coast and the California primary is officially under way. 
We're here outside the San Clarita power plant in Los Angeles, where Senator David Palmer will be addressing local labour leaders and members of the state energy council. 
The senator pledged his support... 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 Bauer's on his way. You in yet? 
 Just about. 
 Good. 
(reporter) This promises to be a landmark day, as it's expected that Senator Palmer will get the delegates he needs to become the firstAfrican-American presidential candidate ofa major political party. 
Ofthe eleven states looking for delegates today, California is expected to be crucial. 
And most ofthe polls say that David Palmer will win by a decisive margin. 
Have you decided? 
l've rewritten the speech l was gonna give this morning. 
l'm gonna tell them about Keith. 
 What are you gonna say? 
 The truth. 
That seven years ago he was involved in an accidental death. 
l need you to stand by me, Sherry. 
lt's the only way to protect Keith. 
l will never forgive you if something bad happens to my son. 
He's my son too. 
And we'll get through this. 
l hope so, David. 
Hey, Mom. 
Good morning, honey. Where's your sister? 
 She changed her mind. She's not going. 
 Really? 
She went to pick up Suzy and Rachel instead. 
Oh, that's right, the Brenner girls are flying in. 
So, uh, what's gonna happen this morning? 
We have to put this thing behind us, Keith. 
Oh, by me being in prison and you in the Oval Office? That how we put it behind us? 
You're not going to prison. 
You didn't do anything wrong. 
 That's not how a jury will see it. 
 Just have a little faith in the system. 
What's this fairy tale that you're living in? 
Look, the world's gonna believe that l killed a white kid who raped my sister. 
You think anyone will believe it was an accident? 
 Yes, l do. 
 Then you're a fool. 
 Keith, no... 
 No, that's all right. 
You talk about fairy tales. 
You think you can run from this? 
You think it's gonna make things better? 
l'm not running anywhere. l'd just rather not 
spend my last hour of freedom with you. 
Let's go and get this over with. 
 Martin Belkin? 
 Yeah. 
Hi. l'm Jessica Abrams, 
l work for Senator Palmer. 
 Hi. 
 Pleasure to meet you. Can l help you...? 
 l got it. 
 OK. Great. Follow me. 
 ls the senator here yet? 
 Not yet, but he is on his way. 
 Great. 
 l am a huge fan of your work. 
 Thank you. 
 (guard) Right this way, please. 
Hi. l'm going to be taking 
some photographs of the senator. 
l need a check on a Belkin. B-e-l-k-i-n. 
First name Martin. 
 (man) Clear on Belkin. 
 All right, copy that. Thank you. 
You can go in. 
(Teri whimpering) Turn right at the light. 
 (lra) You see the bus stop on your left? 
 Yeah. 
Pull over to it. 
Hey, Jack. 
Howyou doing? 
 Don't touch it until l tell you to. Now go. 
 Not until l can talk to my wife and daughter. 
Oh, you'll do this, because it really isn't an inconvenience for me to hurt your daughter. 
Or your wife, for that matter. 
ln fact, here she is. 
Would you like to speak to your husband? 
Say anything you want. 
Tell him you love him. 
 Jack? 
 Teri! 
l don't know where l am. 
l haven't seen Kimberly or... 
(lra) You were saying, Jack? 
You're not sure you want to do this? 
That's what l thought. San Clarita power 
station, 417 Ridgeway Road. Go there now. 
This is temporary, Mrs Bauer. lf Jack follows 
instructions you'll be free within the hour. 
 Where's my daughter? 
 She's here and she's safe. 
Would you take me to her, please? 
 Hey. 
 What, Milo? 
 What happened to Nina? 
 She got called out. 
So what do l do about this key card? 
This was supposed to be important. 
They brought me in on highest priority and l'm sitting around. 
l think Nina got some new intel that pre-empts this. That's why she had to run out. 
 So what should l do? 
 Why don't you help me format some files? 
They didn't bring me here at five in the morning to format files! 
Does Milo know he's working on the wrong key card? 
ls this gonna be a problem? 
Nina Myers is dead. Make up 
a story for why she's not there. 
 Mom! 
 Kimberly! 
(Kim sobbing) lt's OK. lt's OK, honey. 
 Where's Dad? 
 l don't know. 
 Does he know we're in trouble? 
 Yeah, he does. 
He's doing everything he can, baby. 
 l'm sorry. l'm sorry. (sobs) 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it's not your fault. 
lt's not your fault, honey. 
Why don't you tell me about these boys? 
l met them through Janet, and... 
she started dating this guy, Dan, and his friend Rick came into town, and we just hang out, and... oh, God. 
 Have they kept you here the whole time? 
 Yes. 
Janet was hit by a car. 
 l know. 
 You do? 
We are gonna get through this, l promise you. 
Hello? 
Come on, Jamey, pick up. 
(phone rings)  Almeida. 
 Tony. 
 Nina, where you been? 
 l can't get into it. 
Well, force yourself. Where are you? 
Just east of downtown. 
 What are you doing there? 
 Tony, you have to listen to me carefully. 
No one at CTU can know l'm alive. 
 Who would think you were dead? 
 l can't tell you any more right now. 
 Where's Jamey? 
 She's working with Milo. 
 Get her for me. 
 No, not till you tell me what's going on. 
Please, Tony, this is an order. 
 l needyour help. 
 All right. 
Threatening emails, hate mail for Palmer  this is a giant waste of time. 
 When is Nina coming back? 
 Probably not for a couple of hours. 
What makes you say that? 
 l just talked to her. 
 When? 
Couple of minutes ago. She's at Division. 
lt's possible she'll be there all day. 
What do you need? 
Never mind. 
Look, if somebody doesn't tell me what's going on, l'm going to Chapelle. 
l told you, l have to speak to Jamey. 
Yeah, and l just heard her tell Milo you were at Division and you might be there all day. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 Who did she hear that from? 
 She said she just talked to you. 
 Nina, what is going on? 
 We can't trust Jamey. 
 Jack said CTU had been infiltrated. 
 Are you saying Jamey's a spy? 
Why else would she lie? 
She must think l'm dead. 
 Why would she think that? 
 l'll explain later. You have to bring me in. 
OK. l'll come get you. 
No. Stay there. Act as ifeverything's all right. 
Jack behaved very strangely when he was at CTU. These people must be watching us. 
l dunno, probably through our own surveillance. 
All right, look, l'll send a car. 
What's your address? 
 Good morning. 
 Mrs Palmer. 
How are you? 
(Palmer) How you doing today? 
(lra) Allyou have to do now, Jack, is get through security. 
Jack Bauer, CTU. l've been 
cleared by Frank Simes. 
All right, l'll need you to open the case. 
Sure. 
What do you need a laptop for? 
Everything we compiled on Palmer over the last eight hours is in there. 
All right, you wanna lift that up, please? 
Turn it on. 
(lra) Just press any two buttons, Jack. 
(computer bleeps)  All right, go ahead. 
 Thank you. 
Thank you. Where is Senator Palmer now? 
 He's on his way up. 
 Good. 
Excuse me. 
Jack Bauer? 
Jessica Abrams? 
Yeah. Hey. What are you doing here? 
 l'm working security. 
 Wow. How many years has it been, huh? 
 Since high school? 
 Yeah. l'm sorry, l've got to get going. 
Hey, are you still racing motorcycles? 
 (lra) Keep moving, Jack. 
 Not since my daughter was born. 
Look, l'd like to catch up later. 
l've just gotta go. 
 Great, l'll be here. 
 OK. 
 (Jack) What do l do now? 
 Hand the briefcase to one of our people. 
 Who? 
 l'll tell you when it's time. 
Go wait by the buffet table. 
(TV) Now our election coverage shifts to the polls. 
Back east we've had some interesting developments... 
(applause)  Senator, l'd like you to meet Martin Belkin. 
 Senator. 
Good you could make it, Martin. 
Jessica says you're the best. 
l look forward to working with you. 
You're so tired. 
Oh. Hi. 
l brought you some breakfast. 
 ls Kim OK? 
 Who are you? 
 Rick. 
 You're the one who kidnapped my daughter. 
 l didn't know. 
 How could you not know? 
Hey! l tried to help her get out... 
Gaines wants to go over some stuff with us. 
 What's goin' on here, Rick? 
 Nothin'. 
 Don't make friends. 
 l wasn't. 
 Good. They won't be around much longer. 
 What? 
Move it. 
(lra) OK, time to move, Jack. 
Let's head across the floor. 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me. 
OK, Jack, head towards the south wall. 
 Hey, Jack. 
 Hey, Jess. 
Hey, do you remember Tracy Zigler? 
Yeah. Yeah, l just saw her last winter. 
Well, we keep in touch, and she said you and Teri got divorced. 
 (lra) Get out ofthere, Jack. 
 No, we... We just got separated. 
Jared, take care of this. 
Look, if you ever wanted to get in touch, you can reach me at this number here... 
 Are you all right? 
 l'm fine. 
 l am so sorry. 
 No, it's fine. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. 
He's heading across now. 
(lra) Take a left in front ofthe turbines, Jack. 
Show him your lD. 
Jack Bauer, CTU. 
That's my boy. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
Go to the end. 
On your left is medical station three. 
 l'm here. 
 That's where l wantyou. Go in and wait. 
 Oh, my God. What happened to you? 
 l'm OK. 
You don't look OK. 
 ls it safe to come in here? 
 Yeah, l looped the cameras. 
They can't see us. 
 Why is Jack doing all this? 
 They've kidnapped his wife and daughter. 
 How long have you known this? 
 Not long. 
 And you chose not to tell me? 
 That's right. l was acting on orders. 
 Screw orders! 
 Shh. Tony, l'm sorry. 
 Where's Jamey? 
 She's still working with Milo. 
So what do you wanna do? Do you 
wanna restrain her, call in Division? 
No, we can't call anyone yet. 
 We gotta do something. 
 l know. 
This thing must be about Palmer. They're 
using Jack to, what, stop the investigation? 
Maybe. 
Hang on. We gotta do something. 
 Are you sure this room is dark? 
 Yeah, l checked the log. No active cameras. 
We should call Secret Service. 
lf we do, the people holding Teri and Kim will think Jack gave the order. 
l hate to say it, but it's not our problem. 
We have one mandate - protect Palmer. 
 We gotta make the call now. 
 Wait! 
Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger. 
Let's try to find out more before we do anything. 
Are you giving me an order not to call Secret Service? 
No, you're right. 
Hey, this is Tony. Get me 
Agent Pierce's number, please. 
(door opens) Assemble it. 
You want my prints on this weapon. 
Do you really think that anybody's going to believe that l shot David Palmer? 
You better put that away. 
Somebody might get hurt. 
(TV) We're watching Senator Palmer work the room a little bit before he gets to the speech... 
(Tony) Milo, come here. 
 You were right. 
 About what? 
The key card. lt was a forgery. 
We found the original. 
 Where? 
 Jack's office. 
 Why did he swap it out? 
 Doesn't matter. 
Look, l sent it down to Archiving to make a backup of all the data. 
Then it's going straight to you. 
You'll have to work quickly. 
Just get it to me. 
A forged key card. What's that about? 
l have no idea. 
She's squirming. 
(phone rings)  Almeida. 
 This is Pierce from Secret Service. 
Aaron, l calledyou because we have new information you should know about. 
 One of our agents, Jack Bauer, may be there. 
 Yeah, he's here. l cleared him. 
Well, we learned that he may have been compromised. 
 He may not be acting to protect the senator. 
 Are you saying he's a threat? 
Yeah. 
Take the appropriate actions. 
She's on the move. 
OK, ladies' rest room. Second-to-last stall. 
 These cameras are on a 20second loop. 
 Am l clear? 
No, not yet. 
Go. You got 20 seconds. 
Get out. Now. 
Get out! 
Get out! Out! Go! 
l gotta keep you guys working. The fatter 
your pay cheque, the more tax you can afford. 
Excuse me, guys. 
 What's up? 
 l just got a call from CTU. 
 We need to get you out of here, sir. 
 Why? 
 There's a problem with one of their agents. 
 What kind of problem? 
He could be a threat to you. 
lf he's one of ours, find him and take care of this quietly. 
We are trying, sir. 
l tell you what. l'll lose the 
face time, but the speech stays. 
 There's something l have to say. 
 With all due respect, it's a mistake, sir. 
This information comes directly from CTU headquarters. 
l am sure your people will take care of us. 
All right, everyone on the floor, listen up. This is Pierce. 
Palmer has decided to proceed. 
l repeat, Palmer will remain. 
We need to locate and detain a suspect. 
His name is Jack Bauer. 
Bauer's 5'11'', blond hair, 160 pounds. 
He is wearing a dark... 
brown jacket that may display CTU lD. 
This is Hayes. Possible 20 on Bauer. 
How would you like me to proceed? 
 Hold your position. l'll be right there. 
 Copy. 
Hi, Jamey. 
What's this all about? 
 Why don't you tell us? 
 l've no idea what you're talking about. 
 Who were you going to contact? 
 None of your business. lt was personal. 
The same people who set me up to be killed? 
 To be killed? What are you talking about? 
 We don't have time for this. 
Talk to us, Jamey. Who's got 
Jack's wife and daughter? 
 What are they making Jack do? 
 l don't know! 
Richard Walsh is dead. So is Scott Baylor. 
You will be charged with murder and treason. 
l suggest you tell me what's going on! 
 They told me nobody would get hurt. 
 Who are ''they''? 
 l can't tell you. 
 Telling us everything is the only way out! 
You understand? 
l was just supposed to tap into the surveillance. All the security cameras. 
Then they asked me to start sending messages. 
What messages? 
What messages?! 
Mostly about Jack. 
Then about the key card. l didn't know this 
was gonna happen. You have to believe that. 
OK, fine. We do. But now you have to help us. 
Who were you doing all this for? 
 No. l have to talk to someone first. 
 What? No! There is no time, Jamey! 
Palmer is exposed. Jack's family is in danger. 
You have to start talking to us. Now! 
All right, look, l'll make sure everything you tell us goes into cutting you a deal, OK? 
No, l'm not saying anything. 
Not until l get agency counsel. 
Sit. 
(PA) As Mayor ofLos Angeles, l often get the opportunity to meet truly remarkable people. 
People that strive for the greater good, that work to make our world a better place. 
One ofthose people is here today, and ''remarkable'' only begins to describe him. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president ofthe United States, and my good friend, David Palmer. 
(cheering and applause) l love you, Kimberly. You know that? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
lt's important that you know that. 
Mom, if you're feeling guilty about our fight yesterday... 
l'm over it. l just wanna get home. 
That's not why l'm saying that. 
lt's just... we're stuck in this awful place 
and l just want you to know that you're not alone. 
Mom, you're scaring me. 
lt's like you're saying this cos you know something bad's gonna happen. 
No, no, no, no. 
lt's just... 
l'm trying to explain to you what a simple, powerful thing my love for you is. 
So no matter how bad things get, or how good they get, that's not gonna change. 
l just don't know how to do anything but love you. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. 
 l'll be right back. 
 (Palmer) Thank you. 
Thank you, Mayor Nelson. 
And thank you, kind citizens of Los Angeles. 
ldentification, please. 
(Palmer over PA) Now, this country depends on a healthy economy in California. 
And the nucleus of that economy is energy. 
Jack, step out. 
We're ready foryou. 
 To do what? 
 Relax, it will be over in five minutes. 
(Palmer over PA) ..is standing 
right here in this room today. 
(cheering and applause) (lra) Do you see the photographer? 
 Yeah, l see him. 
 Go over andjoin him. 
After he shoots Palmer, he will handyou his weapon. 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 l know you'll be tempted to intervene, but you must believe me, if you do, your family dies and we'll get Palmer anyway. 
l understand. 
When l started my campaign over a year ago, l made a promise to you who supported me that my campaign would be built on integrity, commitment, and above all, honour. 
(cheering) Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Agent Bauer? 
Alan Hayes, Secret Service. 
l need you to come with me. 
 What's the matter? 
 No problem, just come with me. 
Seven years ago... 
Gun! Gun! 
 Get him out! 
 (Palmer) Somebody get Sherry! 
 Looks like Palmer's being shielded. 
 Yeah, but why? 
Bauer! Bauer, what's happening? 
Bauer, did you screw me?! 
l didn't do this. 
Do you understand? 
Please, don't hurt my family. 
Don't hurt my family! l'll help, l promise! 
 Please! Please! 
 That's it, we're done. Kill the wife and kid. 
Get outta here! 
(door opens) l don't have time for this. 
(phone rings)  Hello? 
 What do you want? 
Division wanted to pick up Bauer at the power plant. 
 They've been looking for him all night. 
 Why? 
He's been breaking protocol since you got to him. 
Dammit! 
(Kim and Teri shouting and screaming) (Kim) No! Oh, God! 
No! (sobs) No! 
Gimme your hand. 
(Kim) Please don't! 
 (lra on radio) Eli? 
 Yeah? 
l still need 'em alive. 
Both of 'em? 
Yeah. Take 'em back. 
No... 
No... 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day ofmy life. 
Mom! 
Mom! 
Mom! 
Do you remember anything yet? 
No. 
lt must be weird. 
l mean, l never met anyone that has amnesia before. 
l really appreciate you helping me out. 
 What's your name? 
 Tanya. 
Tanya. 
l hope you're not going too far out of your way. 
lt's fine. The hospital isn't far from here. 
So, you come from money. 
You look like you might. 
Or your husband. 
 My husband? 
 Your little band of gold? 
On your finger? 
l don't have any memory of my husband. 
Agent Pierce, Jack Bauer. 
We met at the breakfast this morning. 
l'm sorry about that. We didn't know the 
pressure you were under. ls your family OK? 
Yes, they're fine, thank you. 
This is my partner, Nina Myers. 
Agents Johnson, Aleshire, surveillance technicians. 
You've met Miss Nash. 
She's part of the senator's advance team. 
Yes, from the senator's staff meeting. 
Can l just say how sorry l am to have caused so much trouble? 
You didn't know who Drazen was. 
Now you know he's a killer,  it takes courage to walk into the same room. 
 l hate to interrupt, but we have to go. 
Drazen is down here in room 1243. 
We went over it. lt's nothing unusual. 
lt's ready to rig however you want to. 
That gives us less than 30 minutes to set up visual and audio. 
 Fibre optics? 
 Yes. 
We also need to set up monitors in an adjacent room. 
We have 1242, across the hallway. 
lt's been vacated already. 
OK, good. Gentlemen, 
l want you to get started right away. 
l want coverage of every square foot of this room by at least two angles. 
 Nina? 
 Yeah? 
Take Miss Nash into 1242. 
Start prepping her. We'll be there in a minute. 
 Have you set up the other checkpoints? 
 Every entrance to the hotel is covered. 
So is every approach from a block away. 
 Any civilians left on the floor? 
 No, we've sealed it off. 
Good work. Let me know 
as soon as Drazen enters this hotel. 
l think there's a hospital at the bottom of the canyon. l'm not sure how good it is. 
Wait, wait. Pull over. 
 You see something you remember? 
 Yeah, l think so. 
 The restaurant? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you recognise anything? 
 l've been here before. 
l was with someone. 
With your husband? 
Not your husband? 
Maybe we should keep going, to the hospital. 
No, no, no. Just being here helps. 
Hey, is there a ma�tre d' or a manager or something? 
 Manager. Mr Martin. 
 ls he here? 
No, but he should be in about 20 minutes. 
Thank you. l'm gonna wait. 
Maybe this Mr Martin knows something about me. 
This place seems so familiar. 
l think l'm gonna stay. 
You don't have to wait with me. 
So, listen. Why don't you 
give me your number, and... 
when l'm better, l'll send you whatever l can afford. 
You know what? 
Send me whatever you can afford, plus ten bucks. 
lt's a cab fare to the hospital, in case Mr Martin can't help you. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. 
So, obviously, without compromising yourself, we need you to behave in the same way you always have with him. 
l know. lt's just the thought 
of letting him touch me again... 
l understand. 
What do you usually talk about with him? His work? 
The truth is, we didn't really talk much. 
lt wasn't that kind of relationship. 
lt was more... take the plunge 
and worry about the consequences later. 
 You know what l mean? 
 Yeah. 
 OK, l'm waiting on the signal. 
 Elizabeth? 
 Hi. 
 l heard what's going on. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 l'm sure. 
 lf you have the slightest hesitation... 
 No, l want to. Definitely. 
 May l talk to you a minute? 
 Yes, sir. 
l told you to look after her, not put her in danger. 
Senator, l don't need to remind you, but the threat against you is very real. 
 lt's no reason to put someone else at risk. 
 l don't think l have. 
l'll be across the hall with a squad of men, ready to come in if something goes wrong. 
He's a professional killer. 
Things can happen fast. 
He is not working alone. 
Arresting him will not stop the others. 
lf you want to put an end to this now, sir, we keep him on the hook. 
l know you've been through a lot, and your family has gone through hell... 
What does that have to do with this? 
l hope you're not letting a desire for payback cloud your judgment. 
Sir, this has nothing to do with payback. 
This is simply the best way to nail these guys, period. 
Elizabeth's father is one of my oldest friends. 
l have known her since she was born. 
lf anything happens to her, l'm holding you personally responsible. 
l understand, Senator, and l promise you l will take care of her. 
(tyres screech, car horn) (phone rings) CTU. Almeida. 
 Hi. l'd like to speak to Jack Bauer. 
 He's not here. Can l take a message? 
Listen, it's really important. 
l need to speak to him now. 
 Who is this? 
 Kim, his daughter. 
 Are you calling from the safe house? 
 No. The safe house has been attacked. 
The agents that were guarding us are dead, and my mother is gone. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. 
The agents are dead? 
Yes. And l think they've kidnapped 
my mother again. 
 l need to speak to my father. 
 He's not here, Kim. 
 Where are you calling from? 
 Um... 
 Can l speak to Nina Myers? 
 She's not here either. 
 Where are you calling from? 
 A payphone. 
 Kim? 
 Who did you say this was again? 
Tony Almeida. l work for your father. 
Tell me where you are. 
l'll have somebody come get you. 
(motorcycle passes) Kim? 
 That's what they said to my mother. 
 That was Jamey Farrell. She was dirty. 
That won't happen again. 
Where are you? l'll have somebody... 
Listen to me. 
l need to speak to my father or Nina Myers. 
He's not here, Kim. 
Neither one of them are here. 
Kim? Hello? 
We got a problem. Jack's daughter says the 
safe house has been hit. The agents are dead. 
Call over there right now. 
Nothing. lt's not even ringing. 
Parker, get Biselli and head over to the safe house on Pine Canyon. 
Heads up - could be trouble. 
Call me when you get there. 
She also said that her mother might have been recaptured. 
 How'd Kim get out? 
 She didn't say. 
She just said she was calling on a payphone. 
Access the phone company's computer for all recent payphone calls  within five miles of the safe house. 
 All right. 
 Are you gonna call Jack or you want me to? 
 Not yet. 
 lt's his wife and kid. 
 That's exactly why. 
He'll get emotional and distracted, put Elizabeth in jeopardy. 
She's going in with Drazen in 15 minutes. 
We need to keep Jack focused. 
 Then when do we tell him? 
 We don't. l do. 
When the situation's under control, and not until. Clear? 
 Thanks. 
 (radio) Standing by. 
Copy. He's on his way down. 
 Are you finished? 
 Ready in ten. 
 How's Elizabeth doing? 
 She says she's OK, but, Jack, l don't know. 
 Sure we're doing the right thing? 
 lf she can plant the device, it'll lead us to everything else. Yes, we are. 
 lf she can't? 
 We'll arrest him, try and turn him. 
He can't touch her. We can protect her. 
 l hope so. 
 Stay focused and we can. 
 Hey! 
 What? 
Are you all right? 
l'm sorry. 
l just can't stop worrying about Teri and Kim. 
When l think what they've been through... 
 My little girl thought she was gonna die. 
 Hey, Jack. We're gonna get them, OK? 
Look, if it's any help, from what l could tell, Teri and Kim seemed all right. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 What did the doctor say? 
 Just some bruises. That's it. 
OK. Thanks. 
 OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Nina? 
 Yeah? 
You said that Paulson was gonna finish the debrief? 
 Yeah. 
 Why didn't you stay and finish it? 
l thought you wanted me back as soon as they were safe. 
No, l specifically asked you to stay with them... 
 Hey, Nina! 
 Yeah, Mike, just a minute. 
 Go back. l will be there in a minute. 
 Yeah? 
(phone rings) l told you to take it off the hook! 
 Yeah? 
 Rick, it's me. 
Kim, l told you you can't keep calling here. 
Look, the safe house was bad. The agents 
are dead and my mother is kidnapped again. 
l know they're after me. You need to help me. 
 Listen, l'm coming to your place. 
 No! 
You're the only person who knows the people that have my mother. 
 l don't! l... 
 Rick... 
l can't go to the police. l don't trust them. 
After today, l don't trust anyone. 
But if you don't help me right now, l will tell the police everything. 
Now, what is your address? 
1804 Glade, in Echo Park. 
1804 Glade, in Echo Park. 
OK, l'm gonna call a taxi right now. 
l'm gonna meet you there as soon as l can. Wait for me. 
Who was that? 
Another wrong number? 
How's the election going? 
 Exit polls look very good. 
 That's great. 
Dad, l'm sorry. 
Sorry about what? 
You weren't covering up Ferragamo's death to protect your campaign. 
You did it to protect me. 
Where'd you hear that? Your mom? 
No, not Mom. 
(Carl) There is some physical evidence in George Ferragamo's office that leads directly to you. 
Subtle enough so the fire marshals didn't find it the first time. 
But with a little help, they'll find it. 
 So l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder? 
 (Carl) Like l said, whatever it takes. 
That's whyyour father backed off, and that's whyyou'll back off. 
Do you know how dangerous it was to go see Carl wearing a wire? 
Look, it doesn't matter. l got it. 
Now you can take it to the police. 
Give me the tape. 
What are you gonna do with it? 
Do you trust me, Keith? 
lt's me. There's been a development. 
Palmer is staying in Los Angeles after all. 
 The Nash girl called you? 
 Yes. l'm on my way to the hotel now. 
Did she say why the senator changed his plans? 
 No, he didn't tell her. 
 Really? She's a highly placed aide. 
Well, they've tightened security since the attempt on his life at breakfast. 
l wonder that she wants to see you again so quickly. You were with her two hours ago. 
You don't understand women, Andre. 
l understand them well enough to know that they can use as well as be used. 
 Not this one. 
 Palmer should have been killed hours ago. 
We can't afford any more mistakes. 
We're running out of time. 
He's as good as dead already. 
You have to trust me in this. 
The Nash woman will tell me Palmer's schedule. She doesn't suspect a thing. 
Maybe not. 
Just to be safe, when you're finished... kill her. 
Miss Nash, please follow me. 
We've been planting fibre-optic cameras here, there and all through here as well. 
l'm not really sure what those are. 
l'm sorry. Please, sit down. 
Fibre-optic cameras are tiny cameras. 
They're almost impossible to see, even if you know where to look. 
So when you come into the room, we'll have visual coverage of the entire suite. 
 And you'll be able to hear everything too? 
 Yes, every word. 
 You all right? 
 Mm. 
OK, now, he's gonna be here in a few minutes. 
This is the tracking device that we want you to plant on Alexis. 
Once he leaves the hotel, we'll be able to track every move that he makes without exposing ourselves at all. 
 Where do l put it? 
 Preferably his wallet. 
He'll have it on him at all times, even if he changes clothes. 
As soon as you plant this device, l'll call you on your cellphone. 
l will tell you the senator is waiting for you. 
You make your excuses, and you get out. 
 So l plant the tracker, the phone rings... 
 And then you'll leave. 
 OK. 
 One more thing. 
lf at any point you think he's suspicious or you're uncomfortable in any way, all you have to do is utter the words ''l hope l'm not getting a cold.'' 
 ''l hope l'm not getting a cold''? 
 Yes. 
Then l'll be in this room in a few seconds with half a dozen other agents. 
 But that would ruin the plan. 
 That doesn't matter. 
Right now all we're concerned with is your safety. Do you understand that? 
l understand. 
You don't have to do this. 
lf you're uncomfortable in any way, no one here will think any less of you. 
l'm fine. 
And thank you. 
For giving me this chance to redeem myself. 
You're going to be fine. 
Let's go. 
Mrs Bauer? 
How good to see you. 
 You know me? 
 Of course. Will Dr Parslow be joining you? 
Dr Parslow? 
l'm sorry. What's your name? 
Mrs Bauer, are you feeling all right? 
Actually, no, l, uh... 
l must have been in an accident or something. l... 
l seem to have lost my memory. 
But l was driving by and this place looked familiar, so... 
You say my name is Bauer? 
Yes. Does that sound familiar? 
Yes, it does, but... 
 But this man you mentioned... 
 Dr Parslow. 
You two used to come in here together quite often. 
But... he's not my husband. 
Well... he's a doctor, and he's a friend. 
Maybe he can help. 
l happen to know the hospital that he works at. Shall l give him a call? 
Yes, please. 
We're set. 
 ls everything up and running? 
 Yep. 
 How's Elizabeth? 
 She's in her room, waiting for Alexis to call. 
 She said she wanted to be alone. 
 Understandable. 
Yes. 
 You wanna tell me what's going on? 
 What do you mean? 
You've been holding something back ever since you got back from the safe house early. 
This isn't the time. Let's not get distracted. 
lf you don't start telling me what's going on, l'm going to be distracted, so spit it out. 
All right. 
Teri knows about us. 
She guessed it. 
l don't know how she did, but she did. 
She asked me point-blank. 
l couldn't deny it. She would have known. 
Did you tell her that it was over? 
Of course l did. 
l think she was just shocked that it was me. 
Someone she knows. 
When Teri and l got back together... 
l tried to talk to her about this, but... 
she said she didn't wanna know, so l just let it go. 
Look, Jack. You asked me 
to go to the safe house, so l did. 
 l was just trying to help. 
 l know, l know. This is my fault. 
 This is all my fault. 
 (Pierce, over radio) Agent Bauer, come in. 
 Bauer. 
 We're a go. 
Drazenjust dropped offthe car with the valet. 
Should be upstairs in two minutes. 
Copy. All personnel in the lobby 
and on the floors, we are a go. We're a go. 
He's in the room. 
(Pierce) Copy that. 
Advise when you are green to go. 
There's no wallet here. 
Let Elizabeth Nash know that the wallet is either in his pants, or the jacket on the bed. 
Copy that, Jack. 
(Pierce) Send her up in one minute. 
One minute. 
Hi. 
 So good to see you. 
 Yeah. 
l can't believe how much l've missed you. 
l know. Me too. 
Even though it's only been two hours. 
lt seems like two years. 
Are you OK? 
l'm fine. Why? 
 You seem a little... tense. 
 No, not at all. 
Well... maybe a little. 
The polls back east close in less than an hour and we're alljust on pins and needles. 
Mm... 
Well, you must have some idea about the outcome. Don't you take, uh... 
 Exit polls. 
 Yes. 
But they're not official. 
What can we do to help you... relax? 
Well, it's a little early, but... 
a vodka might be nice. 
Nothing else? 
lfyou insist. 
 You feeling any better? 
 Much. 
You still don't seem like yourself. 
l'll feel better after l've splashed some water on my face. 
She's going for the jacket. l want SWAT 
personnel ready at the door. Quietly. 
She's got the wallet. 
Oh, God, Jack, she's dropped it. 
Come on. Come on, Elizabeth. You can do it. 
 To the future. 
 She's put it in her coat. 
SWAT team at the door, stand down. 
Stand down at the door. 
l'm sorry that this campaign is giving you so much stress. 
Goes with the territory. 
Maybe when the election is over, the two of us can go somewhere together. 
 Like where? 
 lt doesn't matter to me. 
As long as we're together. 
So... 
who do l have to thank for keeping you in town? 
 He's gonna feel the wallet. 
 Just give her a second. 
She's all right. 
What made the senator decide to change his plans? 
l don't know. 
ls he gonna stay in town for long? 
lt's hard to say. 
What about his... victory speech? 
Will he be delivering it here at the hotel? 
Why are you so interested in the campaign all of a sudden? 
l have no interest in the campaign. 
My interest is in you. 
And l know that you go wherever he goes. 
Well, l don't know where that is yet. 
Well, then l won't let you out of my sight. 
l must say, l do find it a little strange that the senator wouldn't include someone as smart and capable as you  in his inner circle. 
 How would you know how smart l am? 
We've spent maybe 15 hours together, and most of that has been in bed. 
That wasn't smart. 
Was that... a complaint or a compliment? 
Both, l think. 
l just realised that l haven't eaten all day, which may explain why l'm in such a foul mood. 
Do you think we could order something up? 
What are you hungry for? 
Where's the menu? 
l was hoping you would be hungry for something... 
 There you go. Good girl. 
 ..other than food. 
 lt's in the jacket. 
 She made the plant. 
Clear the hallway. Copy. Clear the hallway. 
l know this might seem a little soon... 
l've fallen in love with you. 
 The hallway's clear. 
 Copy. l'm making the call. 
l thought that all women can sense these things. 
(phone rings) Pick up the phone! 
 Aren't you going to answer it? 
 lt's just someone from the campaign. 
 No, it could be important. 
 They can call back. 
Say it again, Alexis. 
 She hung up on me! 
 Say thatyou love me. 
 What is she doing? 
 She's baiting him. 
l love you. 
And if l'm not very much mistaken,  it seems you are falling in love with me too. 
 (phone rings)  l got her voicemail. 
 Wouldyou order me a hamburger? 
Ofcourse. 
 What is she doing? 
 l don't know. 
Why did she take off her jacket? 
What is going on here? 
She has no intention of leaving that room. 
 Room service. How may l help you? 
 Hello? A hamburger, please. 
 All right. Everything on that? 
 Yes, everything. 
 We'll send it right up. 
 OK. 
What's that in her hand? 
So, now... is there anything else? 
Yes. 
 Oh, my God. She's got a knife! 
 SWAT team, hit the room. 
Hit the room now! 
Son of a bitch! 
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! 
Hold your fire! Get me 
some towels from the bathroom! 
Nina, call in a medevac. We're losing him! 
We cannot let him die! Dammit! 
 Just a minute. 
 (cab driver) Yeah, sure. 
( ''Cataract'' by the Trephines) Um... l'm looking for Rick. 
 Who are you? 
 A friend. 
Are you the one that keeps calling? 
 He said that l could come over. 
 Not to me, he didn't. 
 Um... maybe you should ask him, then... 
 l was about to tell you. 
l just didn't think she'd get here so fast. 
What's going on, Rick? 
l'll explain everything. 
 l'm listening. 
 First let her come in. 
lt's OK. 
What does she want? 
Something got screwed up with Dan last night. Big surprise, right? 
That's why my arm was all messed up. 
The guys Dan was with shot me and... 
You said you cut your arm on a fence. 
Um... these people Dan knows, 
l need to find them. 
And l was hoping that l could go in his room and find something to lead me to them. 
 A phone number, an address... 
 So you wanna look through Dan's room? 
Yeah. 
(car horn) l was wondering if l could borrow some money for the cab. 
Teri. 
You all right? 
You don't remember me? 
 Phil? 
 Yes. 
Are you my doctor? 
No, not exactly. 
Henry, thanks for calling. 
Has she had anything to eat or drink? 
l offered, but she didn't want anything. 
No, it's... 
Unless you want some water? 
 Sure. 
 OK. Some water. 
All right, listen. We're gonna 
figure out what this is all about. 
We're gonna get you well again. 
Do you understand? lt's gonna be fine. 
Everything's gonna be fine. 
What do you want me to say? 
We misjudged her emotional state. 
 No, we didn't. You did. 
 lt was an unexpected outcome for everyone. 
 lt's what l said it would be. lt was a bad idea. 
 Fine. Maybe. 
 Now we need to figure out our next move. 
 What is that? What's the status on Alexis? 
He has a fifty-fifty shot, but even if he comes through, we don't know how long till he talks. 
Did you find anything in the room? 
Any phone numbers? Documents? 
 No, nothing yet. 
 What do l tell District? 
Whatever you have to. Just keep them off 
my back. l need time before l fill out reports. 
 (Palmer) Let me in! 
 Hold on. 
 Where's Elizabeth? There was a stabbing? 
 She's fine. 
 Where is she? 
 She's across the hall. She's in custody. 
 What?! Why? 
 She stabbed Drazen. 
 She was defending herself. 
 No, that's not how it went down. 
 She broke from the plan. She attacked him. 
 l should never have let her do it! 
 l gotta call you back. 
 What's going on there? 
 Senator! 
 Let me in. 
 Senator... 
 Say nothing until you speak to a lawyer. 
 l'm sorry. l don't know what happened. 
 lt's all right. We'll work this out. 
 Senator, please let us handle this. 
 (phone rings) l let you do that before, and look where we are! 
You are not helping matters right now. 
 Jack! 
 Excuse me for one second. 
 What? 
 lt's Alexis's phone. What do we do? 
We gotta take a chance. 
 Yeah? 
 (man) Do you have the money? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. We'll meet in 45 minutes. 
 Where? 
 l already told you! 
At Connie's. Downtown. 
 How will l recognise you? 
 l'll wear a red baseball cap. 
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate. 
My wife and daughter have been targeted. 
And people that l work with may be involved in both. 
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life. 
(Patty) You and Sherry were childhood sweethearts? 
 That's right. 
 There's never been anyone else? 
l'm running for president. l can't answer that. 
 Come on. 
 Are you flirting with me, Patty? 
l don't know. l think l might be. 
 l did what you told me. 
 And? 
l think it's working. But it's gonna 
lead to other things, Mrs Palmer. 
 (Mason) Teri, l'm busy. Nina can talk to you. 
 You are not gonna let my husband die! 
No one is gonna let Jack die. 
We just can't go through with the trade. 
There's no difference. 
Without your help he doesn't have a chance. 
l am willing to trade the life ofJack Bauer for that ofmy son. 
OK, we're here. Here's Alexis. Where's Jack? 
Drop the weapon! 
You son of a bitch! 
lf your people deliver my brother as promised, you'll live. 
 What about my daughter? 
 You'll hear from us when this is over. 
(phone rings) Yeah! 
(Andre) South ofthe platform there's a car. 
lfyou want to see Kim alive, talk to no one, get into it, and head toward Century City. 
(phone rings) Yeah. 
 (Andre) Proceed to Palmer's hotel. 
 What do you want me to do? 
When your government abducted my father, they also froze $200 million of our assets. 
Palmer has the necessary clearance to unfreeze them. 
So everything that happened today was because of money? 
l wouldn't say that. That money is ours. 
We'll call Palmer at this number at exactly 10.45. 
Once l receive confirmation of the transfer, l'll give you further instructions. 
What kind of instructions? 
 You want me to take out Palmer. 
 Well, of course. 
That's why we let you go. 
That's why we have your daughter. 
 Jack? 
 l'm still here. 
Remember, we'll call at exactly 10.45. 
l trust l don't have to tell you what will happen if Palmer doesn't answer. 
 Hello, Patty. 
 You left the party early. 
l wasn't in the mood. What's up? 
l was just wondering if you had a chance to look at the Dallas schedule. 
 lt's fine. 
 Good. 
Um, do you need anything else from me? 
Sit down. 
A little while ago, we started down a road that was gonna take us to a dangerous place. 
l know. And l'm sorry. 
Are you? 
Sorry? 
l'm attracted to you, Senator. 
l always have been. 
Meet me in 20 minutes in room 907. 
l'll be waiting for you. 
(door opens) Oh, David, good. l... 
l, uh... need to talk to you for a second. 
 l'll just make those changes to the schedule. 
 Thanks, Patty. 
l, uh... told Keith and Nicole 
that we're going to stump it separately for the next couple of days. 
What did they say? 
 They know we're not getting along, David. 
 Fine. What are they going to do? 
They'll stay with me. 
Unless, of course, you want them with you. 
No. l could use a couple of days alone. 
Great. 
We gotta work under a couple of assumptions here. 
The only way to find Jack is through Drazen. 
The only way to get to Drazen is if Alexis takes us there. 
So we gotta devote all of our resources to finding Alexis. 
 Yeah, but he shed the trackers. 
 l know. 
So we use the satellite and run computer simulators. 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 (Jack) George, it's me. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. Drazen let me go. 
 But l can't come in yet. 
 What do you mean? 
George, listen. Tell Teri l'm out. 
l know she's worried about me. 
lfDrazen calls, don't tell him that we talked. 
lt'll put Kim in danger. 
 Fine. But, Jack, let us help you. 
 George, l gotta go. 
l don't like the sound of that. 
 What do you think he's doing? 
 lf Drazen let him go for a reason... 
Jack won't let us help him, he won't tell us what he's doing... 
Whatever he's doing, he's trying to protect Kim. 
What's the one thing we know for sure that Drazen wants? 
Palmer dead. 
Jane, connect me with the Palmer suite, Secret Service. 
What's happening? 
 l can't stop the internal bleeding. 
 Do not let him die! 
Father... 
Alexie! 
Do something! 
l'm sorry. There's nothing more l can do. 
No. Leave us. We're family. 
First Mother and Martina... 
Now Alexis. 
 And it's Bauer! 
 Andre, not yet! We still need her! 
 Call him. Let him hear her die! 
 Andre! 
Uh, could you wait for me, please? 
Thanks. 
 Well? 
 He wants to see me. 
 When? 
 Tonight. 
He didn't waste much time, huh? 
How are you doing? 
 l told you, l feel really uncomfortable... 
 No, no, Patty, please. Don't patronise me. 
You feel uncomfortable, but not because you're ready to be with my husband. 
You feel uncomfortable because you're doing it with my knowledge and consent. 
Why are you doing this, Mrs Palmer? 
lt's... lt's important for David's career 
that l have his full confidence. 
And l no longer have that. 
And you want me to get it? 
Yes. And report back to me. 
 We both know what it's going to...? 
 Yes. We do. 
 And you're OK with that? 
 No, l never said l was OK with it. 
But l'm willing to accept it... 
because it's necessary. 
Your elevator's waiting. 
Just make sure that Palmer has an extra layer of security. 
 lt's gonna be a little difficult... 
 Yes, l know. 
Nina, got a minute? 
 Hold on. 
 This is important. 
Paul, we're done. OK. What? 
The schematics to the detention facility where they were holding Victor Drazen. 
They've been tampered with. 
 Who has access to these archives? 
 Division and District. 
Can you find out who's had access to these in the last month? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, do it. The sooner the better. 
 You think this is a second dirty agent? 
 Yeah. 
What did Tony want? 
He was just telling me why it was so hard to pick up a thread on Drazen. 
Listen, l need your help. 
Teri Bauer's a basket case. 
 l don't know what you think l can do. 
 You're good with her. You calm her down. 
Come on! l gotta deal with Chapelle, 
DOD's still trying to pass the buck... 
All right. 
She's in the conference room. 
l know. 
 ls it over? Did they make the trade? 
 Jack's safe. He's no longer a hostage. 
ls he on his way? 
 We don't know where he is. 
 What? 
He called in to tell us he was OK, but he didn't say anything else. 
 Why not? 
 Drazen wants him to do something else. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
Why would he do anything for that man? 
 l think it's to protect Kim. 
 What are you talking about? 
Teri, the reason that Kim isn't back... 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 Just listen to me. 
We think that's where Jack is now. 
He's trying to bring Kim back. 
He's not communicating with us... 
to protect her. 
l'm sorry. 
The task we have given your father is a simple one. 
And if he does it... 
will you let me go? 
We will see. 
 Jack, l just got your message. 
 Senator, l need to see you right away. 
 Your office said you might be coming. 
 l am coming there. 
 Why? 
 l have a message from Victor Drazen. 
They also said that Drazen has your daughter, and you could be a threat. 
They've added to my security. Secret Service 
has been instructed not to let you near me. 
They do have my daughter, but l'm not coming there to harm you in any way. 
 What does Drazen want you to do? 
 He wants to speak to you at 10.45. 
lt's a scrambled phone so that it can't be traced. 
 What does he want to talk about? 
 Money. l'll explain when l get there. 
Just tell your people to let me through. 
Drazen's people, who are holding your daughter hostage, want me dead. 
You're asking a lot, Jack. 
They had my wife and daughter today, and l still managed to save your life. 
l'm not coming there to harm you in any way. 
l give you my word, sir. 
Hi. 
Anyone see you come up? 
No, l was careful. 
Why don't you sit down? 
Well, how much time do we have? 
Don't worry about that. 
l have something l wanna tell you, Patty. 
Yes? 
You're fired. 
Pack up. Get out. 
And don't bother to ask me or anyone else on my staff for a reference. 
Prospective employers won't like what l have to say. 
 l don't understand. 
 l know what you're doing. 
You're working with my wife against me. 
Senator, l'm sorry. 
l didn't mean to deceive you like this. 
But your wife insisted and l didn't know what to say. 
 ''No'' would have done it. 
 l know, l know. l should have. 
 lt's just that... she can be scary sometimes. 
 So can l. 
Obviously l have made a terrible mistake in judgment, and if there's anything l can do... 
l want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes. 
You gotta take a look at this. These six people 
have accessed the detention-facility archives. 
The first five were just doing scheduled backups. Here's the sixth. 
George? 
George is the mole? 
lt's possible. He accessed 
that file four days ago. 
Why would he have done that if he wasn't involved? 
 You gotta call Chapelle. 
 No, shut down his network access. 
You can't let anything go in or out. 
OK. l just gotta figure out 
how l'm gonna do it. 
 Where were you? 
 Downstairs. 
 Downstairs? 
 Yeah. 
ln room 907... with Patty. 
What? 
Save your energy, Sherry. 
No need to act surprised. 
l fired her. 
You know your problem, David? 
You think everyone's conspiring against you, when in fact we're just trying to help. 
By putting another woman in my bed? 
Do you realise how sick that is? 
Oh, come on. We chose a certain life, 
and we chose that a long time ago. 
lt's not about a house in the suburbs and PTA meetings. 
And whether you're willing to accept it or not, we serve a higher purpose. 
You are not qualified to talk about higher purposes. 
 Oh, l'm not? 
 No, you're not. 
We are about to move into the White House. 
That's right. We. 
You and l. 
And all the issues, all the politics, all the hard work that's gonna help get us there... 
l'm as much a part of that as you. 
So don't even try to deny it. 
Please, Sherry... don't go there. 
l'm not begrudging a single thing, David. 
l don't need the limelight. 
 You sent her to spy on me! 
 That's right! And do you wanna know why? 
 Yes, l do. 
 Because you need me to look out for you. 
And if you cut me out of your inner circle, like you threatened earlier today, you will fail. 
ln every way. 
You need me, David. 
 (knock on door)  What? 
 Jack Bauer just arrived, sir. 
 l'll be out in a moment. 
We're not done here. 
 Jack. 
 Senator. 
Convincing Secret Service to let you come up to see me was difficult enough. 
 They won't let me out of their sight. 
 That's fine. All that matters 
is that you talk to Victor Drazen when he calls, listen to his demands and cooperate. 
How did they get your daughter? 
Senator, we don't have much time. 
He could call any second. 
 OK, you said this was about money? 
 Yes. 
$200 million of his was frozen after he was abducted. 
 And? 
 He wants it. 
He says you have the clearance to get it back. 
He'll give you instructions when he calls. 
That's why he sent you? 
To get me to release his funds? 
Once he has confirmation of the transfer, he'll ask me to take action against you. 
 To kill me? 
 Yes. 
Of course, l would never do you any harm. 
He has my daughter. l'm trying to buy time. 
Jack, l don't have the authority to transfer those funds, and Drazen knows that. 
 What do you mean? 
 He knows our system. That money's gone. 
l don't think that's the reason he's calling. 
(phone rings) Senator, please, answer this phone. 
OK, Jack. l'll do what l can. 
l'll tell him what he wants to hear. 
 l can't guarantee he'll buy it. 
 Thank you. 
 This is David Palmer. 
 Senator Palmer. 
lt must be nice being reunited with your friend Jack Bauer. 
 What do you want? 
 (electronic whine) Drazen? Drazen? 
He knows you can't get the money. Senator... 
No! 
(static on phone) Are you all right, sir? 
A detonation of this magnitude had to be military plastique. 
 Get a powder residue. We'll try and trace it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Where is he? David! 
 Ma'am, this area's not... 
Let her through. lt's OK. Calm down. 
 Where's Keith and Nicole? 
 At the party. Are you all right? 
 l'm fine. 
 Oh, God. 
Senator. 
This is Jack Bauer from CTU, the man who saved my life twice today. 
 Mrs Palmer. 
 The man that put your life in danger? 
 Sherry, please! 
 (radio) Status report on the senator? 
Don't answer that yet. Senator, 
we need to talk about this. My daughter... 
Tell them you don't know yet. 
This is Ron. 
We don't have a 20 on the senator yet. 
What's going on? 
The man that planned this explosion needs to believe that it was a success. 
Wait a minute. You mean, you want 
the world to think that David is dead? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Absolutely not. 
David, what's this all about? 
His daughter is being held hostage. 
But we can't have people thinking David was assassinated. lt's preposterous! 
 lf we don't, ma'am, my daughter will die. 
 Then what do you suggest we do, Mr Bauer? 
We keep the senator quarantined for a few hours. 
We leak a story to the press that he was killed in the explosion. 
 You've got to be kidding. 
 l've never been more serious in my life. 
 No, it's not gonna happen. David, tell him. 
 This is about the life of an innocent girl. 
David, we cannot keep playing games with the public and expect to keep their trust. 
Senator, if we're gonna do this, we need to do this now. 
Go downstairs. Bring the children up. 
Talk to no one. l mean it. 
l need all the agents that have seen the senator. 
 Who is your senior chief of staff? 
 Mike Novick. 
Bring in Mr Novick as well. 
As soon as Mr Palmer's family gets here, no one is to enter or exit this area. Understood? 
Now, Sherry! 
 l'm very sorry. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Are you sure this is gonna work? 
 lt has to. 
Hey, Almeida. What's going on 
with my network access? 
 What do you mean? 
 l can't access archives or Palmer's itinerary. 
 l'll call lTS. 
 l don't have time for that. Are you up? 
 Yeah, l think so. 
 Let's see. 
Yeah, here it is. 
So Palmer's still going to Dallas tomorrow. 
Call Secret Service and find out what time his plane leaves. 
 Division's got it covered. l don't think... 
 Hey, real simple. 
Call Secret Service. 
Find out what time his plane leaves. 
And get my network up and running. 
(phone rings)  What happened? 
 Well, he found out he's cut off. 
And he seems overly interested in what happens to Palmer after he leaves LA. 
 We should alert Chapelle. 
 No, not yet. 
lf we go to Chapelle without evidence, he'll slice us up. 
 What about his access? 
 l'm gonna have to restore it. 
All right, but monitor everything and send it to me. 
Put it up on all the monitors! 
Everybody, eyes on monitors. 
(TV) Events are unfolding by the minute in this tragic and stunning development. 
The hotel has been sealed off. Only a limited 
number of authorised personnel are allowed inside. 
We have heard from a spokesperson from the Palmer camp, who has just confirmed that Senator David Palmer has been killed in an explosion. 
There is speculation this is related to this morning's assassination attempt, but at this time no one has been arrested. 
We did it, father. We did it. 
Ah, yes. 
All right. l'll take care of the girl, 
then we can leave. 
Do not do anything until we know that Jack Bauer is dead. Do nothing. 
(phone rings) Sir, we just contacted Mike Novick. 
He's on his way. 
Agent Bauer, it's for you. 
Thank you. 
 Yeah? 
 (Andre) You're a very lucky man, Mr Bauer. 
l was calling to confirm your death, but l see you've survived. 
Andre. 
l have an offer to make you. 
You've killed Senator Palmer. 
l'm the last person on your list. 
l'll make you a trade: me for my daughter. 
Come to Port of Los Angeles.  
Dock 11A. 
What assurances do l have that you'll let her go when l arrive? 
Sadly, none. But we've decided the sins 
of the father need not be visited upon her. 
Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A. 
l'll be there in 30 minutes. 
And, Jack, if you bring your colleagues or involve them in any way, we'll know. 
l understand. 
l have to go alone. 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you, sir. 
Why are you doing this to us? 
Yeah, Jack, l can tell him, but you should really let us help you on this. 
No, l can't, not yet. 
Give us a general position, so we can be nearby. 
No. lf Drazen's got someone else working 
on the inside, it could put Kim in danger. 
All right. 
 Let me speak to Teri. 
 OK. 
lt's Jack. 
 Jack? 
 How are you holdin' up? 
 Where are you? Do you know about Kim? 
 Yes. l'm on my way to pick her up. She's fine. 
 Where is she? 
 l can't say now, sweetheart. 
But l promise you, soon she's going to be with you. 
Thank God. What do you mean ''she''? 
What about you? 
 l'm sorry. l meant to say both of us. 
 Oh, good. 
l just don't think l can take much more of this. 
l need you both here, Jack. 
l know, sweetheart. Look, it's almost over. 
Just hang in there, OK? 
OK. 
 Teri? 
 What? 
 l love you. 
 l love you too, Jack. 
Honey, um... 
There's something l have to tell you. 
 l've been waiting for the right time. 
 What is it? 
You're gonna be a father. 
Again. 
What are you saying, that you're pregnant? 
Well, yes, that's generally how it works, Jack. 
 Jack? 
 l'm still here. 
l'm sorry, it was the last thing l thought you were gonna say. 
Are you all right with this? 
Are you happy about this? 
Oh, yes.  
l am. 
l keep thinking that... maybe it's the 
second chance we've been talking about. 
Are you there? 
 Yeah, l'm still here. 
 Are you happy about it? 
Yes. Yes, l'm happy about it. 
l'm very, very happy. 
Good. Are you sure everything's OK? 
Yeah. 
Sweetheart... l promise you 
everything is gonna be OK. 
lt's just been a really, really long day. 
Just get on back here so we can all go home, OK? 
OK. 
Teri... l love you so much. 
l love you too, Jack.  
l'll see you soon. 
l had a sister once. 
She was full of life...  
like you. 
She was a photographer and took hundreds of pictures. 
l used to love looking at them. 
Now l can't do that any more. 
You know how she died? 
Has anyone told you? 
Your father killed her. 
 My father would never kill innocent people. 
 You wanted to know. 
 l don't believe you. 
 Oh, he says it was an accident. 
But when a man goes halfway round the world to set off a bomb, he's responsible for any ''accidents'' that result. 
Has your father ever talked about his work? 
About where he goes... 
on those long trips overseas? 
Of course not. 
 He can't. 
 Because he's a criminal. 
My father is a good man. 
No. 
He's not. 
Palmer's still alive. The suite at his hotel 
blew up, but apparently he got out unscathed. 
 Why the reports? 
 l haven't been debriefed, but l guess it makes sense as a defensive strategy. 
Palmer's safe as long as the hitters think he's dead. 
This goes no further than the three of us until the public's made aware that he survived. 
 What about the perpetrators? 
 lt's unclear. 
Our intel is being refreshed by Secret Service as we speak. 
So, stay at your stations. Start rebuilding 
profiles based on the incoming information and we'll have a new plan in place within the hour. 
Have you spoken to Jack since the first time he called? 
Not me. 
lt doesn't matter. 
This'll all be over soon anyway. 
 Have you talked to Jack? 
 Yeah, he called, but he won't let us help him. 
lt's kind of cold. 
Do you mind if l have some coffee? 
Aaargh! 
(shouting in Serbian) (speaks Serbian) (Andre) Stop right there, Kim!  
Don't move! 
Don't be foolish! You'll drown! 
(speaks Serbian) How are we going to do this without the girl? 
Bauer has no choice but to trust us. 
(phone rings) (in Serbian) Oh, there you are. 
We just got some new intel from Langley. 
 Oh, good. 
 Yeah, take a look at this.
