Who is it you're looking for? 
Someone who can give me the names of everyone else involved. 
I need you to write the story in case I don't make it. 
If Dalia Hassan finds out that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband, she'll never sign the agreement. 
MEREDITH: I need to speak to your mother. 
It's about the people who really murdered your father. 
We know who is responsible. 
What you don't know is, those people were working under the orders of Russian agents. 
Bauer made contact with Meredith Reed. 
My God. 
You need to call her publisher and demand that they do not run the story. 
You're suggesting muzzling the press? 
If you don't use the power of your office to shut this story down, your peace agreement won't be the only casualty. 
I need you to contact the FBI. 
Have them locate Reed and seize whatever evidence she purports to have. 
Meredith Reed? FBI. 
You're under arrest. 
Let's go. 
But I... 
You were right about Jack. 
He is working with somebody. 
It's James Ricker, ex-CIA op. 
We found him living in a place on Mercer Street. 
He's not gonna be happy we tracked him down. 
I need you to talk to him. 
Get him to tell us where Jack is. 
Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides? 
I want to expose this cover-up as much as you. I'm in. 
(tires screech, horn honks) That's Jack Bauer! 
(coughing) Get up. I could just 
kill you right here. 
Do you know the name of the person inside the Russian government who's giving the orders? 
I want that name. 
Jack. 
Give me the name! 
I'll tell you. 
Four. 
Three. 
Mikhail Novakovich! 
Where's Novakovich? 
He's dead. 
Bauer just came in shooting. 
Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered by Jack Bauer. 
What? 
LOGAN: As far as, uh, Bauer is concerned, the trail ended with Novakovich. 
Then Bauer has no idea that Novakovich was operating under my orders? 
None. 
If you're so worried about Bauer, you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker. 
(phone ringing) Arlo. 
Cole, I just picked up a preliminary flash. 
Jack murdered Novakovich at his hotel, and six of his security guards. 
According to a witness, Jack killed all seven men on his own. 
Then fell right back off the radar. 
Eden can't find any trace of him. 
Does Chloe know about this? 
I just talked to her, and she should be at the U.N. any minute. 
Cole, I know that we need this evidence that Jack has, but this crime scene is a slaughterhouse. 
Does Chloe really still think she can pull this off? 
If anyone can talk Jack down, it's Chloe. 
And if she can't? 
Then we're both prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him. 
Even when Novakovich's whole security staff couldn't? 
What do you want me to do, Arlo? 
The truth about what went down today needs to get out, and that's not going to happen unless we get to Jack. 
Look, I'm coming up on Ricker's apartment. 
I'm going in. 
Cole. COLE: What? 
Ricker went to a lot of trouble to disappear. 
He's not going to like that you found him. 
I'm not expecting him to. 
TV REPORTER: You're looking at the U.N. Plaza gardens 
and the podium from which all three co-sponsors of the peace treaty will address the public following a private signing ceremony inside the U.N.'s 
Council Chamber. 
Russian President Yuri Suvarov, the third co-sponsor of the treaty, is en route to the U.N. 
where he will join President Taylor and acting IRK President Dalia Hassan... 
(computer alarm chimes) (alarm chiming stops) (knocking) COLE: Mr. Ricker, 
this is Agent Ortiz, CTU! 
Open that door. 
(gun cocking) Before you pull that trigger, there's something you ought to know. 
I don't place a call in 15 minutes, every intelligence agency in the country gets alerted about you. 
Weapon charges alone will get you locked up for the duration, Or you can help us find Jack Bauer, and we'll keep our mouths shut. 
You think you're protecting him? 
The order on Jack Bauer is shoot to kill. 
He knew what he was getting himself into. 
Jack's not thinking straight. 
Look, I read your file. 
I know Jack saved your life in Damascus. 
This is your opportunity to pay back that debt. 
You know how this is gonna end, right? 
Do you? 
If Jack dies today, it's on you. 
Hey. 
Wait a minute. 
Wait a minute. 
(garbled radio transmission) Thanks, Adam. 
(text alert tone) Director O'Brian, Agent Burke. 
I have the revised security assessment for you. 
Ma'am, I noticed that Agent Ortiz's name was back on the duty roster. That's right. 
He was arrested for helping Jack Bauer. 
I got him a temporary clearance so he could help us out here. 
He was the one who designed the U.N. protocols 
in the first place. 
I know. 
Do you really think we can trust him? 
I wouldn't have gotten him a release if I didn't. 
(phone ringing) Yes, ma'am. 
Excuse me. 
(Burke clears throat) What happened? 
COLE: Not good, Chloe. 
I think Jack's targeting Suvarov. 
Is that what Ricker said? 
Yeah. Jack planted a bug 
on Charles Logan, overheard a conversation between the two men. 
Turns out Suvarov's the one who gave the order for Renee to be killed. 
(sighs) Does Ricker have a recording of that conversation? 
No. He wiped his system clean 
as soon as he saw me coming. 
But the surveillance rig he gave Jack records everything to a backup, so Jack has a copy. 
Good. We're 
gonna need it. 
Why? 
The White House just arrested Meredith Reed. 
They confiscated a data card from her. 
Dana's evidence. 
Exactly. The recording 
that Jack has is the only proof we have now. 
(sighs) Chloe, I don't know that getting proof is our first priority anymore. 
We have to put an alert out on Jack. 
If we do that, then Pillar will get to him first. 
He'll kill Jack, and he'll destroy the recording. 
Chloe, we can't stand by and let Jack assassinate the president of Russia. 
No, but we can buy ourselves time. 
Can change Suvarov's motorcade route, sequester him in the U.N. 
Make it impossible for Jack to get to him. 
Yeah, except Suvarov's gonna be standing at that podium soon, and once he's exposed like that, we can't protect him. 
That's not happening for over an hour. 
If we haven't found Jack by then, then we can put out the alert. 
It's still taking a big risk, Chloe. 
I know. 
All right, get Suvarov's route changed. 
But you're putting me in charge of his security as soon as he gets to the U.N. 
How far out are you? 
I'll be there in ten. 
(car engine starting) (tires squeak) (garbled radio transmission) Okay. 
Sir, the flash about Novakovich is going out. 
You wanted to speak with the president before that happened. 
Ah. 
(exhales) Thank you, Jason. 
Oh, um... 
do we know anything about Bauer? 
No. Nothing. 
If you don't mind me asking, sir. 
What are you going to tell the president? 
I think it's time she... 
she knows everything. 
All the delegates are present with the exception of Suvarov, who's still in transit. 
He'll be given the details once he arrives. (phone ringing) 
Excuse me, Tim. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I'm about to go into the protocol meeting. 
What's going on? 
I wanted you to hear this news from me first. 
What news? 
I tried to insulate you as long as I could, preserve your plausible deniability, but... 
Just tell me what you're talking about, Charles. 
Jack Bauer isn't just trying to gather evidence about the conspiracy. 
He's... 
He's seeking retribution. 
Go on. 
Bauer just murdered Mikhail Novakovich, along with a good number of his staff. 
(whispering): So Novakovich was responsible for the assassination of President Hassan? 
Yes. Yes, ma'am. 
Novakovich was the ranking member of the Russian Delegation. 
President Suvarov is going to demand an explanation. 
Actually, he's not. 
Are you telling me that Hassan's murder goes all the way up to Suvarov? 
Yes. 
But the good news is that Bauer doesn't know that. 
How can you be sure? 
Because according to a witness, Bauer killed Novakovich before he could talk. 
And aside from me, Novakavich is the only person who ever knew that Suvarov was calling the shots. 
Madam President, Bauer's finished what he started, an-and Suvarov will be happy to sweep this under the rug. 
An-and the peace agreement can go forward as planned. 
This is... 
Really, we couldn't have asked for a better outcome. 
Except that I am asking Dalia Hassan to shake hands with her husband's murderer. 
Madam President... 
Call Suvarov. 
Tell him that I am aware of his involvement in this, and that I will see him at the signing. 
(snaps cell phone shut) My apologies. 
Thank you for waiting. 
How did the call go? 
I told the president about Suvarov's involvement, and, um... 
she understood- not that she has an alternative. 
Well, that's good news, sir. 
PILLAR: Your new Secret Service detail's here to escort you to the U.N. 
Thank you, Jason. 
It's been a long road, but, uh... 
(chuckles): we're almost there. 
(Logan groans) (slaps car twice) (phone auto-dialing) Anything new on Bauer? 
A security camera picked him up leaving Novakovich's hotel. 
Confirmed what Berkov told us. 
Bauer was definitely wounded during the attack. 
How badly? 
Badly enough that he's gonna need treatment. 
Getting alerts out to medical facilities now. 
All right, also let Port Authority and INS know Bauer might be trying to get out of the country. 
We'll find him- it's only a question of time. 
Maybe a little quicker than you thought. 
Slowly, take your weapon out and pass it back to me. 
Slowly. 
Start the car and drive. 
You saw what I did to Pavel. 
I didn't have a lot of time with him. 
You, I've got all the time in the world. 
So you either do what I say, or I will take you apart piece by piece. 
Now, drive! 
(panting) Where are we going? 
The U.N. 
Why? You already 
got what you wanted. 
You killed everyone involved. 
Save your breath. 
I know about President Suvarov. 
Your delegations will be joining you at the reception after the post-signing ceremony. 
And finally, on behalf of the U.N. staff, 
I would like to say that we are all honored to be part of this historic occasion. 
Thank you for your time. 
Your daughter's been waiting inside to speak to you. 
She says it's important. 
(exhales) Let her know I'll be right there. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Madam President. 
I have something for you. 
It's from Omar. 
He wanted to give it to you to sign the agreement, and... 
I'm grateful that I can do so on his behalf. 
It reads: "All religions, "all this singing, "one song, peace be with you." 
It is a verse Omar would quote from Rumi when he was talking about what you and he were trying to achieve. 
Thank you for seeing this through and for helping us all do justice to his memory. 
Dalia, I am... 
I am honored. 
I'm very honored. 
Th Kayla, what is it? 
Meredith Reed called the residence looking for you. 
I am not interested in that woman's condolences. 
That is not why she called. 
She says she has information about the people who are behind Father's murder. 
But we know who was behind your father's death extremists in our country. 
(whispers): She claims that they had outside hKYp. 
That the Russians were involved. 
Why would she say such a thing? 
Does she have evidence, or is this just a rumor? 
I don't know, but it can't have been easy for her to call you. 
I don't think she would have done so because of a rumor. 
What else did she say? 
She wouldn't say anything more until she talked to you. 
She left her number. 
Let's call her from the residence. 
(indistinct radio transmissions) Ann, President Suvarov's motorcade is delayed five minutes because of the new route- put out an all-agency. 
How do you want it coded? 
Eyes only. 
Yes, ma'am. 
(sighs) Lanza, make sure Burke reports here with a set of tactical gear for Agent Ortiz. Yes, ma'am. 
Arlo's at CTU, running the surveillance video through facial recognition software. 
Still no sign of Jack. 
Look, I've been thinking. 
Let's say we do get this recording from Jack. 
What are we supposed to do with it? 
I mean, if the president's willing to lock down Meredith Reed... 
She can't shut down every media outlet in the world, which is where we're gonna send this file. 
We're also gonna send it to every government employee in the country. 
Legislative, military, judiciary that's over a hundred thousand people. 
How are we doing this? 
By using CTU servers, we can distribute it simultaneously to everyone. 
President Taylor won't be able to stop the truth from getting out. 
Burke. 
Good to see yo Sir. 
Did you use the revised protocol for President Suvarov's arrival? 
Yes, ma'am. 
We're now bringing the motorcade into the FDR Drive ramp. Good. 
Make sure that Agent Ortiz has the revised protocols. 
He's back in charge. 
Let's take a look. 
We're going to the Hart Building. 
I want you to park underground. 
This guard's life is in your hands. 
You make one move that I don't like, I'm gonna kill you both, you understand? 
Jason Pillar. 
There's no one inside. 
They left the building two hours ago. 
Yeah, I'm just running a last-minute security check. 
Of course, sir. 
Is there anything else, sir? 
No. Thank you. 
Drive. 
(grunting quietly) (panting) Pull in over here. 
Slowly, with your right hand, take the keys out of the ignition and pass them back. 
Get out of the car. 
(panting) Now! 
Close the door. 
Put your hands on the roof. 
Don't you move. 
Suvarov's not gonna be out on the podium for another hour. 
You're not gonna make it that long, not the way you're bleeding. 
(panting) Slowly, back up towards me. 
Stop. Turn around. 
Good. 
You're gonna suture me up. 
(groans) You try and make a move on me, the slightest twitch, I will put a bullet in your brain. 
You got it? 
Yes. 
(groans) (Jack panting) (gasps) I don't understand something. 
You've spent your entire career working outside the system; you've always had a good reason. 
But this... 
it's just blood lost. 
You're destroying an agreement that took years to put together. 
An agreement made by murderers and liars. 
(gasps) Murderers? 
You're the one killing people in cold blood. 
Everybody I took out had a hand in today's attack. 
But who makes you judge and jury? 
President Taylor, when she agreed to the cover-up. 
I would have accepted justice by law... 
but that was taken away from me by people like you. 
So you're right I am judge and jury. 
Now, step back. 
Turn around. 
Start to move back towards the car. 
Look, I came in after Hassan and Renee were killed. 
I didn't have anything to do with that, you have to believe me. 
Get on your knees! Please, 
Bauer, I'm telling you the truth. 
I've got a family; I've got a little girl. 
Shut up. 
Please... 
(muttering): I'm telling you the truth. 
(grunts) (loud thump) (panting) (yells) Still no answer. 
Are you sure this is Meredith Reed's number? 
It's the number she gave me. 
Then why isn't she answering? 
I just talked to Gary Klausner, Ms. Reed's editor. 
He doesn't know where she is and has no way to reach her. 
He seemed very anxious to get off the phone. 
Where are you going? 
President Taylor and I are supposed to be sitting across the table from Yuri Suvarov in less than an hour. 
If his government was involved in murdering your father, President Taylor needs to know. 
TV NEWS ANCHOR: Following the death of Omar Hassan, President Suvarov was reportedly pessimistic about the viability of the peace treaty. 
But rumors of a Russian withdrawal were soon dismissed by the White House, and President Suvarov is expected to arrive at the U.N. shortly. 
(knocking) Yes? 
Excuse me, Madam President. 
It's Dalia Hassan. 
I'll have to call her back. 
She's outside, ma'am. 
She says it's urgent. 
Send her in. 
(clears throat) (footsteps approaching) (sighs) Madam President, forgive me. 
I have just heard something that is very disturbing. 
What did you hear? 
That the Russian government, or people within the Russian government, were involved in the murder of my husband. 
Where did you hear this? 
My daughter received a phone call from the journalist, Meredith Reed. 
Have you spoken with her yourself? 
No. 
I've tried everything, but I've been unable to reach her. 
I came here to ask for your help finding Miss Reed. 
I need to know if there is any truth in what she said. 
Dalia, we heard a rumor about the Russians being involved as well. 
And you didn't tell me? 
No. Because we looked into it 
and found that there was nothing backing it up. 
It was just a frivolous accusation. 
Whatever else she may be, Meredith Reed is not a frivolous woman. 
She came to me, someone she knew would have every reason to doubt her. 
(clears throat) Dalia... 
I know that you want answers... 
but we are signing the agreement in less than an hour. 
Madam President, I feel like you're not listening to me. 
Before I sign a treaty with people who may have murdered my husband, I need help finding this woman. 
Please. 
I will do the best I can in the time that we have left. 
I don't think I'm making myself clear. 
Until I determine if her allegations are true, I will not sign this treaty. 
Dalia... 
please, be reasonable. 
This is my position, Madam President. 
I will not change my mind. 
(inhales and exhales loudly) Then you... 
You leave me no choice. 
I had Meredith Reed arrested. 
Why? 
Because her allegations would be too damaging. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
You wouldn't arrest someone for making false allegations. 
Unless they aren't false. 
You knew! 
You knew the Russians were behind my husband's death, and you said nothing?! 
Dalia, I am so sorry. 
(sighs) It-it was an im-impossible situation. 
(sighs) I was trying to protect you. 
Protect me? 
You betrayed me! 
Dalia, we are about to complete the most important diplomatic action in generations. 
Your husband sacrificed his life to preserve this agreement... 
How dare you invoke my husband! 
He never would have stood for this! 
This treaty happened because he trusted you. 
And even though every fiber in my being wanted to go home and grieve, I carried on because I trusted you. 
But not anymore. 
I will not make peace with the people who murdered my husband. 
Or with you. 
There will be no agreement. 
I will be entering a formal complaint with the United Nations, demanding that you release Ms. Reed, 
and disclose whatever evidence you've kept from me and from the rest of the world! 
Stop! 
In one hour, you will stand beside me in the council chamber, and you will sign the treaty your husband and I agreed to. 
I will not! 
You will! 
Because if you don't, my administration will disclose hard, indisputable evidence that agents inside your intelligence service attempted to detonate a nuclear device on our soil, which will give me all the justification I need to retaliate against the IRK with the full force of the American military. 
It will be decades before your country recovers. 
But it doesn't need to come to that. 
All you have to do is sign the agreement. 
Dalia?! 
(door slams) (clattering) (panting) First they murder my husband, and now this woman who has lied to me is threatening my country! 
(panting) I don't see a way out of this, Madam President. 
We can tell the world what these Russian bastards did, and how President Taylor protected them. 
We can take our case directly to The Hague. 
There is no case. 
No proof to support any of these accusations. 
More important, there are President Taylor's threats to consider. 
We cannot dismiss them. 
Our military can protect us from incursion. 
And if necessary, we can reactivate our nuclear program! 
Giving your husband's enemies exactly what they wanted in the first place. 
In addition to providing her with even more of an excuse to launch a preemptive military strike against us. 
I don't care what President Taylor said; she wouldn't dare. 
Can you really take that chance? 
(phone rings) Yes? 
Thank you. 
Yuri Suvarov's delegation will be arriving any moment. 
President Taylor is expecting you there to greet him. 
(panting) CHLOE: Agent Ortiz? 
What's going on? 
I spoke with Arlo. 
He got a facial recognition hit on Jack. 
Where? 
Inside our perimeter. 
He's here, Cole. 
He's been careful to avoid all the security cameras, but Arlo found this. 
It's from the 22nd floor of the Hart Building across the street from the U.N. 
The software picked up his reflection. 
How did he get into the building? 
According to the logs, the only person that entered the building within the past 20 minutes was Pillar. 
Jack must have taken him hostage. 
The windows on the east side of the building give him a clean line of sight down onto the podium. 
I'm going to go find him. 
I'm going with you. 
You can't. 
It would just cause a fight. 
I'm the only one that Jack will listen to. And what if he doesn't? 
(sighs) Give me 20 minutes. 
If you don't hear from me, we'll follow through with our plan. 
Sound the alarm about Jack and secure Suvarov. 
20 minutes. 
Okay. 
And keep your comm open. 
I want to know what's going on. I can't. 
CTU is monitoring all frequencies. 
It's too risky. 
All right. 
At least take this. 
Thanks. 
Be careful. 
(switch clicks) (computer chirps) Where's O'Brian headed? 
She's running a last-minute perimeter sweep. 
By herself? 
Keep a real-time uplink open with Suvarov's security people. 
Let me know when it's up and running. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) Okay. 
(beeps) Hey. 
(sighs) As long as I can remember, every time I've had to talk to you, it seems, for one reason or another, I've started out by telling you how sorry I am. 
I'm not going to do that to you now. 
You're going to hear a lot of stories about what I've done today. 
Some of them may even be true. 
But no one, and I mean no one can tell you why I did what I did except for me. 
And a lot of good people died today. 
Not just President Hassan. 
Operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies. 
ReneWalker. 
Who I was very close to. 
Yes? 
Thank you. 
President Suvarov's motorcade has just rounded the corner. 
Was Mrs. Hassan notified 
of his arrival? 
I believe so, ma'am. 
Yes or no, Tim? 
Which is it? 
Is she coming or not? 
Why wouldn't she be? 
âª âª President Taylor, that we are all here together is a tribute to your persistence. 
Mrs. Hassan, I am 
sorry for your loss. 
I admired your husband very much. 
We're wanted upstairs for the press conference. 
Yes, of course. 
Mr. President. 
Dalia, I know that this is very difficult for you. 
There is nothing left for either of us to say, Madam President. 
(garbled radio transmission) Chloe O'Brian, Director of CTU. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Master key and building schematics you requested. 
(beeps) (applause) Good afternoon, fellow delegates and ladies and gentlemen of the press. 
The last 24 hours have been the most difficult in this long and challenging road that we've all traveled together to reach this moment. 
Now, the eyes of the entire world are looking to the leaders standing here with me now, ready to usher in a new era of transparency, honesty and trust. 
President Taylor, President Hassan President Suvarov have each risen to this challenge for the sake of world peace. 
And the treaty that they have created together represents the culmination of their courageous efforts. 
(applause) Agent Burke? 
Sir. 
I need you to assemble a ten-man squad and deploy them to Sector C-7. 
The Hart Building, sir? We 
already have men on post there. 
Not nearly enough if there's a threat anywhere along that corridor. 
Keep your men outside the building until you hear otherwise. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) (panting) âª âª (sighs) (gasps) What the hell are you doing here? 
You don't have to kill Suvarov. 
There's another way. 
Who else knows where I am? 
Please listen. 
Who else knows?! 
Cole and Arlo. 
If I don't get you out of here in ten minutes, Cole's gonna send in every agent we have. 
(panting) Jack, they're going to kill you. 
There's a standing order to shoot you on sight. 
I couldn't let that happen. 
You shouldn't have come after me. 
You're my friend. 
I didn't have a choice. 
Neither do I. 
(gagging) Don't fight it. 
(coughs) Don't fight it. 
(gasping for air) (gasping stops) (Jack sighs) (rifle cocking) (phone ringing) Jason, you watching this? 
Jason? 
JACK: I have a five-five-six rifle pointed straight at your head. 
Bauer. 
The bullet travels 2,900 feet per second. 
If you try and move, you're a dead man. 
Which means you need to do exactly what I say. 
Do you understand? 
(gasps) Do you understand? 
Uh, Jack, I told you everything I know. 
And you thought I believed you? 
(recorder clicks on) LOGAN (on tape): And aside from me, Novakovich was the only one who knew that Suvarov was calling the shots. 
(recorder clicks off) What do you want? 
I want you to call President Suvarov and have him meet you where you are as soon as the press conference is over. 
What am I supposed to tell him? 
Try the truth for a change. 
Tell him you've got credible intelligence about a threat to his life.
