There's an irk splinter cell trying to smuggle weapons-Grade Uranium into the city. 
Just read the threat assessment. 
Look, i need you to shut down all bridge and tunnel traffic Into the city. 
where'd he go? 
There's only one way for them to get in. 
Across the east river. 
That's right. 
Ctu was just hit by an emp. 
All of our systems are down. 
It's a real mess. 
Where's jack? 
I think he might be in some kind of trouble. 
We need to find him. 
You need to get ctu back on line as soon as you can. 
Once you acquire jack's position, You can direct me to him. 
I have a faster way to get us back on line. 
They won't listen. 
then you need To make them listen, chloe. 
Do what you have to do. 
Frank haynam, senior engineer at the new york field office. 
I hope that you're here to help, because we can damn well use it. 
You going in through the clr processor? 
That's right. We're gonna 
create a brand-New subnet. 
That'll take forever. 
I think i can create a workaround. 
Why not tap directly into the trunk line? 
What i'm suggesting will be a lot faster. 
I'm here to clean up your mess. 
You need to leave. 
You get out. 
Get out! 
We got power to comm. 
Load the rods into the zodiac. 
It'll be short work Once we get the rods across the river. 
a vehicle is coming. 
wait until the suv's in range, Then take them out. 
Get down! Now! 
I've got two men leaving the doc in a boat. 
They're carrying a box the right size and shape For the rods, jack. 
Jack, i got through to ctu. 
They just got back on line. 
Nypd's sending choppers. 
We still got a real good shot of finding them. 
oh, god. 
I know you're involved with that robbery, miss walsh. 
What? 
You are out of your mind. 
I'm not leaving here until i know the truth. 
Ctu is back on line. 
I know. 
Their helicopter's searching the river. 
They're getting close. 
We're going to need your help getting clear. 
I will get you out of there. 
Stand by. I'll call you 
in a few minutes. 
You have grade iii level bruising. 
Are you sure you don't want any painkillers? 
They're wrapped tight. 
They'll be fine. 
I can't know if the ribs Are broken without an x-Ray. 
You should see a doctor. 
Any more stress could cause the lung to collapse. 
Trust me, they're not broken. Thanks. 
Renee: are you sure you're okay? 
Fine. 
Where are we at with the fuel rods? 
We found the zodiac partly submerged In the river near 11th street, empty. 
The rods are in manhattan, jack. 
It's not over yet. 
Ctu doesn't think we're more than a few minutes behind. 
Who's running the ground op? Cole? 
Yeah. 
Okay, i want you to contact chloe. 
Get her to download archival photos from 11th and the river. 
Have her date 'em back 15 minutes. 
Fire it up. I want you ready 
to go as soon as We've got a target. 
Sir, just spoke to a witness who said he saw four men Unloading the contents of a metal crate into a yellow cab. 
He didn't get a plate. 
Chloe, can we roll back satellite? 
We can now. Nsa 
just rerouted them. 
I'm logging onto their server now. 
This is from one minute ago. 
I'm rolling back in 30 second increments. 
This is from six minutes ago. 
Find them in real time, chloe. 
Arlo, alert nypd. Dana? 
Right here, sir. 
Contact hazmat And nest teams, get them mobilized. 
Right on that. 
Almost there, sir. 
okay, i'm live. 
Suspects are proceeding west on 14th street. 
Cole did you get that? 
Yes, sir. 
On the move. 
they've located you on satellite. 
How far away are they? 
Not very. Hold on. 
Arlo: nypd confirms they have units on the way. 
Hastings: how far out? 
Ten blocks Coming from the north. 
Head to the south. 
Turn left. 
Suspect just turned south on seventh. 
Got it. 
I hear sirens. 
Hurry up. 
Just a second. 
I'm inserting the machine code now. 
Just get ready. 
Satellite will be disabled for 30 seconds. 
On my mark. 
Go. 
What happened? 
The trunk line just went out. 
Get it back! 
Cole, we just lost picture. 
Last known location Seventh and waverly. 
Copy that. 
Where are you now? 
On the hudson, heading uptown again. 
You'll run into ninth avenue. 
You'll be able to blend into cab traffic there. 
Back up. 
Cab's gone. 
Find it! 
Scanning. 
Arlo, help me widen the grid. 
You take west of seventh, i'll take east. 
Widening it now. 
anything? 
Not yet. 
You, chloe? 
No. We were out for 30 seconds. 
They could be anywhere. 
Cole, we're back up, but we lost them. 
I'll have nypd cordon off the area. 
You have them check Every garage, warehouse, loading dock. 
They must have pulled in somewhere. 
Yes, sir. 
Get me the president. 
Are we clear? 
Yes. 
Good. We're moving 
the weapon into place As soon as it is assembled. 
I need you to send me nypd patrol patterns and checkpoints. 
As soon as it's safe. 
That's not good enough. 
I need them now. 
My instructions were to help you, Not jeopardize my cover. 
I will call you back when i can. 
Madam president, i'm afraid i have bad news. 
Despite our best efforts, The terrorists have gotten the nuclear rods into manhattan. 
How good is your intelligence? 
Are you sure? 
We are, sir. 
In fact we had a visual on the suspects Until a few moments ago. 
What happened? 
We lost them. 
We're launching a multiagency search In the area we think they're in. 
That you think they're in? 
Will you be able to find them, or not? 
We're doing everything in our power, mr. Kanin, 
But right now i don't have an answer for you. 
Madam president, i'm sorry to have to tell you this... 
I can no longer guarantee the safety of manhattan. 
How the hell could this happen?! 
Ctu had one priority: to make sure this didn't happen! 
It's unacceptable! 
Mr. Hastings, i want you 
to consider the entire resources Of the government at your disposal. 
Whatever help you need, we must find those rods. 
I understand, madam president. 
We also need to prepare for the worst. 
I want all branches of local law enforcement ready To respond to an imminent radiological attack. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Ethan, set up a situation room And assemble the national security team. 
Has president hassan Been evacuated from the un yet? 
He will be shortly, but as of right now, He's still at the un. 
Get me jack bauer. 
Yeah, but how long was the satellite was down? 
What, 30 seconds? 
Yeah. I know what 
you're thinking, jack. 
Odd we lost the feed just as we were closing in on the target. 
Who was running point at ctu? 
Chloe o'brian. 
You know her from before, right? 
yes. 
And you trust her? 
With my life. 
Mr. Bauer, i have 
president taylor for you. 
Cole, i've got to call you back. 
I got the white house on the line. 
Hello? 
Jack, it's president taylor. 
I'm calling to ask you a favor. 
Anything, ma'am. 
President hassan and his family are being evacuated From the un and brought here, and i would like For you to supervise that operation. 
With all due respect, madam president, I think i'd be much more helpful staying in place Here with ctu. Besides, 
Secret service is more than capable. 
Well, that may be true, but i'd feel a lot better Knowing you were on the job. 
Jack, in light of the threat to new york, President hassan's role In securing a lasting peace is more crucial than ever. 
I need him safe. 
I understand, ma'am. 
I'll leave for the un immediately. 
Thank you, jack. 
I'll see you when you get here. 
Yes, ma'am. 
She wants me to supervise hassan's evac To mcguire air force base. 
All right, let's go. 
Renee. 
Renee, i need to do this on my own. 
We're not going through this again. 
I'm coming with you, end of discussion. 
Do you have the rods? 
In the trunk. 
Where is ali? 
He didn't make it. 
I'm sorry. 
Tarin will take his place as driver. 
How long before the device is functional? 
All we have to do is load in the fuel rods. 
Tarin. 
Get ready to leave. 
I want to place the bomb As soon after i talk to the president as possible. 
agent o'connor. 
Jack bauer. 
I know who you are, sir. 
I've been briefed by command at mcguire. 
Ms. Walker. 
Agent o'connor. 
We're cleared for a subterranean evacuation. 
The feeling is that president hassan Will be safer underground in the event Of a radiological attack. 
Agreed. 
How many agents? 
There are seven secret service, Including myself, two of hassan's internal security, And now you and ms. Walker. 
What's the time frame? 
Ten minutes. 
There's a service tunnel that runs parallel To the path lines leading into new jersey. 
We're just waiting on the vehicles now. 
I'd like to see the exact route. 
Of course. 
I have the maps and evac protocols In the conference room, But president hassan is asking to see you first. 
He's in the council chamber. 
Fine. You two get started. 
I'll be right back. 
Excuse me. 
Sir. 
Mr. Bauer. 
President taylor wanted me to supervise The evacuation of you and your family To mcguire air force base. 
So i'm told. 
And i'm glad for it. 
How long will it take for you And your family to be ready? 
We're ready now. 
My wife and daughter are in the residence Awaiting your instructions. 
Give us ten minutes And then we'll evacuate you and your family Through a service tunnel under the building And straight on to new jersey. 
And here i thought i would be leaving the united nations today At the head of a peace march down fifth avenue. 
My president still thinks that might happen, sir. 
I hope she's right, mr. Bauer. 
Me, too, mr. President. 
Give us ten minutes. 
We need to talk about a response, madam president. 
I've prepared three Retaliatory strike scenarios Against targets inside the irk. 
do i need to remind you, General brucker, the islamic republic Is an ally? 
You don't. 
But what good is an ally If its citizens can Attack us on their own? 
Madam president, A call's come into the white house switchboard From a man claiming to be in possession of the nuclear rods. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Do we believe he's who he says he is? 
Confidence is high, ma'am. 
He's offered details Of recent events that no civilian could know, plus he's On an anonymous icc channel that's scrambled And impossible to trace. 
Put him on speaker. 
This is president taylor. 
Good morning, madam president. 
This is going to be a short conversation. 
Who are you and what do you want? 
You know i have the fuel rods. 
You know i got them into manhattan. 
What i want now is to convince you That i have no desire to harm innocent americans. 
And yet you're threatening them with a bomb. 
Actually, a radiological dispersal device, Madam president, capable of contaminating 40 square blocks under a dense radiation cloud. 
Any attack on the united states Will prompt a retaliation against your country. 
I would expect nothing less. 
But you should listen to me. 
What i'm asking for is simple. 
Turn over president hassan. 
What? 
He's a traitor to his people and must stand trial For his crimes. 
That will never happen. 
You have exactly one hour to change your mind. 
Mr. Woods knows 
how to contact me. 
Madam president... 
The clock starts now. 
40 squares blocks How many people is that? 
Between a 100,000 and 150,000. 
Rob, inform Ctu of the threat, but the ransom demand Stays in this room. 
Tim, call up the new york guard To support first responders, And have the military police execute An evacuation plan. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Madam president? 
What is it, rob? 
Well, i'm just going to say it. 
We should consider the alternative. 
What alternative? 
We have an out here. 
I think we should take it. 
You mean, give in He demand to turn over President hassan? 
No one man Is worth the lives of tens of thousands. 
And you know what? I bet 
He would agree. 
Madam president, are we really having This conversation? 
Doesn't it Deserve a conversation? 
Not unless you're intent on destroying Our moral authority. 
This country's unique place among nations, maybe forever. 
As opposed to what? 
The irradiation Of all those people? 
Real businesses, real homes Uninhabitable for a hundred years or more? 
Madam president, I agree. 
Giving up hassan is wrong, But a 40-Block wasteland at the heart of new york city Is unthinkable. 
This country would never be the same. 
The country would Crucify us if word ever got out That this could have been avoided. 
Now we're talking politics, for god's sake? 
We're talking about the primary role of government Any government-- Which is To protect its citizens. 
It could also escalate, Madam president. 
They attack us, We attack them back. 
The entire region could be drawn into the conflict And destabilized. 
Excuse me, general, But weren't you the one just advocating For a retaliatory strike? 
Well, in the military, We like to talk about facts on the ground. 
Well, they have changed, madam president. 
Now, we have a viable option. 
Viable? 
Is that the sense in the room then? 
That surrendering President hassan is somehow viable? 
In the first place, The people who are offering us this deal cannot be trusted. 
How do we know they won't detonate the bomb anyway? 
Secondly, president hassan Is a guest of this country. 
He is my partner in peace. 
And i will not sell him out To the very terrorists that we are determined To defeat. 
And finally, Caving to any terrorist demand Weakens this nation immeasurably. 
Now, we have 60 minutes To find these bastards. 
And i believe we will. 
But if we don't, and the worst happens, We will deal with it. 
We will pick ourselves up off the floor and deal with it. 
Why? Because that's what 
we do. 
Americans don't stay down. 
We rise up together in times of crisis. 
We carry on. 
Is that clear? 
Start the calls, tim. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Chloe, i need an updated list Of road closures and checkpoints. 
I thought arlo was interfacing with nypd. 
He is, but national guard units are on their way, So are teams from fbi new jersey. 
I want to know where the holes are, so i can plug them. 
I'll forward it to your screen now. 
Thank you. 
yes? 
It's me. 
Do you have the roadblock information? 
I'll have it for you in five minutes. 
Did you speak to president taylor? 
I did. 
Her response was as i anticipated. 
But as the time pressure builds, she'll change her mind And give up hassan. 
I'm certain of it. 
What if she doesn't? 
Then we'll strike a hard blow against the city. 
Either way, the peace process dies. 
It's ready. 
I don't have time to deal with these anymore. 
Mr. Weiss? 
Can i have a word? 
Certainly. 
I thought secretary kanin's Point was a good one. 
If we simply turn hassan over, We risk damaging the good name of the united states. 
What are you suggesting? 
Uh, a third way. 
A covert action in which we Deliver hassan to the terrorists, But make it look like they took him hostage. 
Two birds, mr. Weiss. 
We spare new york And we preserve our reputation In the eyes of the world. 
I admit, i'm intrigued. 
But...? 
It'll never fly. 
You heard the president. 
She won't go for it. 
Not in a million years. 
No, of course, she won't. 
The question is, Will you? 
I'm asking For your cooperation, mr. Weiss. 
For the good of the country. 
Well, even if i agreed to help, it's too late. 
Hassan's already on his way here. 
No, it's not. A wet ops 
team was mobilized In the event of a strike against the irk. 
If you get me hassan's exact route, i can redirect them To intercept his security detail. 
I don't have access to that information. 
It's being handled through The secretary of state's office. 
Then we just have to get it from mr. Kanin. 
It's sedition, general brucker. 
Are you familiar with the fourth nuremberg principle? 
If the orders of the president Are illegal, it is our Moral obligation to disobey them. 
And you think they are? Illegal? 
The president is letting her idealism Get in the way of her responsibilities As commander in chief. 
It's hardly the same thing. 
You don't think so? 
With the fate of an american city in the balance? 
"The primary role of government is to protect Its citizens." 
Your words, mr. Weiss. 
It's time to decide whether or not you meant them. 
The white house just received credible intelligence That the terrorists we've been tracking Plan to detonate a radiological device In new york city in less than 50 minutes. 
all of us in this building have friends And family who live in the city. 
We know we are Bound by law not to warn them. 
But we also know it is still in our power to protect them. 
We are their last line of defense. 
That is our job. 
That is what we will do With every second of every minute we have left. 
Starting now. 
Go back through all your leads. 
Appeal to your sources one more time. 
Find that bomb. 
I just heard from our source inside ctu. 
Based on the roadblocks, amsterdam is closed off, But there's a potential target area just to your left. 
You'll be avoiding nypd checkpoints To the south and west. 
All right. 
Turning. 
Can you park in that block? 
Yes. 
Good. The fallout radius 
will include a good part Of the upper west side. 
I'll wait for your call. 
How many men on the detail? 
Eleven. Hassan's own security, 
secret service, And two former agents Jack bauer and renee walker. 
Why is bauer involved? 
The president trusts him. 
And believe me, he's not someone to be taken lightly. 
Oh, he's up against an elite team Who will have the advantage of surprise. 
Bauer and his people don't stand a chance. 
The loss of life is regrettable, mr. Weiss. 
No one feels this more keenly Than a soldier who's led men into battle. 
But right now, we don't have a choice. 
ethan. 
What's going on? 
Oh, i'm sorry. 
I thought you were with the president. 
I was. 
What are you doing in here? 
Oh, i asked mr. Weiss 
To pull up the latest white house readiness protocols. 
He couldn't log on from his computer, So we were trying from yours. 
I was also reviewing president hassan's itinerary To see if we could facilitate a military escort. 
Hmm. 
Open the door. 
I'm afraid i can't do that, mr. Kanin. 
Then get out of my way. 
Rob? 
Ethan, listen, i... 
No, you listen to me. 
I think i have a pretty good idea What's going on here. 
Sit down, mr. Kanin. 
There are some things you need to know. 
There sure as hell are. 
But i'll stay where i am, If you don't mind. 
Ethan, do what he says. 
Sit down, please. 
this is bauer. Go ahead. 
I said, go ahead. 
Give me your phone. 
General... 
Get your hands off of me! 
wait! 
This is beyond madness. 
The two of you will spend the rest of your lives in prison. 
Maybe, mr. Kanin. 
But my guess is that one day, The country will thank us for it. 
Rob... i'm begging you. 
Don't do this. 
Don't betray your president. 
ethan? Ethan? 
All right. 
Ethan! 
My god! Ethan! 
Ethan! 
Okay. 
Oh! 
Okay. 
Ethan, here, here, here. 
Call 911. 
We call for help, the first thing He does is get word to the president. 
But he's having a heart attack! 
We can't just do nothing! 
We didn't do nothing; you gave him his medication. 
Well, it's not working. 
Look, i realize that you two are close. 
But this is not an emotional decision, This is a tactical one. 
We wait to acquire hassan Before calling an ambulance, understand? 
What if he doesn't make it that long? 
We have to pray that he does. 
All right? 
All right. 
Come on. 
We pick up the service tunnel under third avenue. 
From there, the trip to mcguire by convoy Is less than 30 minutes. 
Thank you, ms. Walker. 
Secretary kanin, this is jack bauer. 
I can see on my phone that you just tried to call me. 
Please call me back as soon as you can. 
Thank you. 
This is bauer. Patch me through 
to mcguire air force base. 
How far are you from an access point into the tunnels? 
Uh, based on what i'm looking at, Less than two miles. 
Well, the security detail's already on the move. 
Can you get there in time? 
Yeah, if we haul ass. 
And the ambush happens where? 
At the vehicle, sir. 
Remember, the objective is president hassan. 
Do what you have to do to take him alive. 
Yes, sir. 
Good luck. 
Thank you. Have him call me back 
as soon as possible. 
renee. 
Yeah? 
Secretary kanin tried to call me. 
Now he's not answering his phone. 
The operator at mcguire air force base Can't find him either. 
Something's not right. 
Keep your eyes open. 
Hold up. 
We set? 
Yeah, the vehicles To transport the hassans are 200 meters Up the tunnel. 
There is a section Of construction we couldn't get by. 
unit one, this is mcguire. 
Your route to gate 4 has been secured. 
Did you walk it? 
Yes, sir. All clear. 
Get the family. 
This way. 
Our suvs are a short hike up the tunnel. 
Stay together as we move towards them. 
This is bauer. 
Patch me through to secretary kanin. 
here they come. 
Man 2: is hassan with them? 
Yes. 
Masks on. 
Take your positions. 
Wait until the targets are in the kill zone. 
Remember, we need to take hassan alive. 
secretary kanin? 
Just a minute. 
Yes, what is it? 
Excuse me, sir, but jack bauer's calling for secretary kanin. 
Well, the secretary is busy with me right now. 
I understand that, sir, But mr. Bauer's persisting. 
He says it's very important. 
He's holding on line one. 
All right, thank you. 
I'll take care of it. 
Jack, hi. It's rob weiss. 
sir, we're in a service tunnel under... 
I'm sorry, you're breaking up, jack. 
Can't hear you. 
I said, we're in a service tunnel under the un. 
We're evacuating president hassan and his family. 
Is everything all right? 
You tell me. 
Secretary kanin tried to get ahold of me About ten minutes ago on his private cell. 
I've been trying him ever since; he won't pick up. 
Well, the secretary's tied up With the joint chiefs right now, jack. 
Do you know what he wanted to talk to me about? 
Honestly couldn't say. 
I could've been anything. 
I don't think so. 
He knows we're conducting a sensitive evac. 
He called me during it. 
There's got to be some kind of a connection. 
Well, i'll make sure he gets the message. 
Mr. Weiss, 
I don't think you understand. 
I need to talk to secretary kanin now. 
That's not possible. 
What do you mean, it's not possible? 
We're dealing with an imminent Terrorist attack on our soil! 
Just do your job and let us do ours! 
all due respect, sir, i am doing my j... 
Hello? Hello? 
Son of a bitch just hung up on me. 
He's under a lot of stress; they all are. 
I don't give a... 
agent o'connor, stop. 
Start walking them back now. 
Something's not right. 
We're gonna head back to the un, reassess there. 
Let's go. 
President hassan, i'm very sorry, But you're too exposed down here. 
Whatever you think is right, mr. Bauer. 
They're turning around. 
How far are they? 
About a hundred yards. 
Okay, take out as many as you can. 
Renee! 
I need you to get president hassan And his family to the side tunnel and back to the un! 
What about you?! 
I'll be right behind you! 
President hassan, You need to go. 
Now. Now! 
Okay, go. 
Go, go. 
Go! Go! 
Your orders are to stay with president hassan. 
You need to go. 
I know what i have to do, sir. 
Good luck. 
Thank you, sir. 
You ready? 
I'm ready. 
Now! 
See if you can get wide and outflank them. 
I'm going to try to draw them into a crossfire. 
Shoot only on my command. 
Engage. 
Mr. President, we 
need to keep moving. 
Your people are being slaughtered, mr. Bauer. 
We need to help them. 
They're buying us the time we need. 
Don't let it be in vain. 
We need to go now! 
Give me a weapon. No. 
I've been a soldier, mr. Bauer. 
I can handle a gun. 
I'll fight with you. 
Mr. President, my job 
is to protect you. 
You need to do what i say. Now, go! 
We to keep moving. 
Come on. 
come on. We got to go. 
Renee, we're not going to make it. 
Take cover. 
Go! Go! 
I'm going to head up the middle. 
As soon as i set these off, i want you to start firing. 
Doesn't matter if you hit anything. 
Just make some noise. 
Mr. President? 
You take care of your family. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Mathis! Donner! Go! 
Move! Move! 
Move! Move! Move! 
I'm going to take the high ground. 
In about five seconds, start giving me cover fire. 
Okay? 
Take the weapon off. 
Take the weapon off now! 
Now! 
Who are you? 
You're making a huge mistake. 
You're american. 
Why did you attack us? 
Because a dirty bomb will be detonated in new york Unless we deliver hassan to the terrorists. 
What are you talking about? 
A ransom demand has been made. 
Him for the bomb by 06:15 hours. 
Jack, that's less than 20 minutes. 
Does the president know about this? 
She's refusing to deal with the terrorists. 
This is general brucker's operation. 
Get up. Get up! 
What are you doing? 
I'm going to get you up to the street level, Where i can make a phone call. 
There's no time for that. 
This is on you now. 
You have to deliver hassan to the terrorists. 
I don't take orders from anybody But the president of the united states. Now, move.

Yes? 
Why haven't i heard from you? 
Because i don't know anything. 
What does that mean? 
Are the americans handing over hassan, or not? 
The only information we have Is that he's being transported to mcguire air force base. 
We lost communication with his security detail About 20 minutes ago. 
So president taylor doesn't intend to give him up. 
Samir... think for a minute. 
You use that bomb, you lose your leverage. 
The president leaves me no choice. 
The blood will be on her hands. 
Samir!

Yes? 
The president has not responded. 
Start the countdown. 
You need to stay with the bomb. 
Make sure no one interferes with it.

Your name will never be forgotten, my friend. 
Your family will be honored above all others.
