I don't want to see either one of you ever again. 
Do we have a deal or not? 
Yeah, we got a deal. 
I'm going after him. 
We're done. 
We're just getting started. 
Jenny! 
We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested. 
I know you consider Tarin a friend. 
We are more than friends. 
We're in love. 
You've been carrying on with this man... 
behind my back? 
Who are these men, Samir? 
These are men I have recruited. 
We can't get the rods out of the country, so let's use them as a radiological bomb. 
Then we'll show the Americans how strong we are. 
Samir! 
Over here! 
There are people chasing me. 
They have the rods you are looking for. 
I thought you had the rods. 
They turned against me. 
Just get me out of here. 
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan. 
When things get this colossally screwed up people look for someone to blame. 
So what have you got in mind? 
Renee Walker- she killed one of our main leads. 
You're talking about a woman who put her life on the line when she didn't have to. 
Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian. 
I'm sending someone over from Justice- Kristin Smith. 
She'll take care of everything. 
They're setting you up don't say another word. 
It's too late. 
This is over. 
We're leaving now. 
Hands in the air. 
Do it now! 
You offering to bring in Farhad? Yes. 
If you drop the criminal investigation against Renee Walker. 
If we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation, it's till this whole thing is over and done. 
Deal. 
We're about to transport him to the embassy. 
You have two minutes. 
Thank you. 
Bashir, clear the room. 
Tarin, did they hurt you? 
Not yet. 
They won't until they get me to our embassy. 
I tried to reason with my father, but he wouldn't listen. 
He thinks you're involved in the conspiracy with his brother. 
Even after I told him about us, he doesn't trust you. 
You told him about us? 
I hoped it would change his mind. 
But if anything, it's made things worse between us. 
Come closer. 
Listen to me, Kayla, there is a way out of this. 
There are a few men still loyal to me- Bashir is one of them. 
He's agreed to help me escape. 
As soon as he's able, Bashir will slip me a handcuff key, and he's placed a gun in the car for me to find. 
You won't hurt anyone? 
The gun is so I won't have to. 
Once I'm free, I have a place to stay until the Americans grant me asylum. 
Kayla... I want 
you to come with me. 
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel. 
Promise me you'll come. 
Tarin, we need to go. 
Cole, he's dead! 
Just go. 
What? 
Just go. 
Nobody knows you had anything to do with this. 
It's my fault. 
I lied about everything. 
Who I am, what I've done. 
I'll call the police. 
I deserve to take the blame for this. 
What's done is done. 
We're cleaning this up, and no one's ever gonna know what happened. 
I don't want you involved. 
I'm already involved. 
We're gonna strip down his van so it can't be I.D.'d. 
We'll dump the bodies in the swamp. 
Hey. Hey! 
They're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em. 
You want to go to prison for the rest of your life? For them?! 
Get started on the van. 
I'll go get the other one. 
Mr. Hastings, 
the president's on the line. 
Thank you. This is Hastings. 
Mr. Hastings, I'm 
here with Rob Weiss. 
I was told you have urgent news. 
Yes, ma'am. 
We received a call from Farhad Hassan. 
Farhad? 
Yes. As we suspected, 
he was trying to smuggle the nuclear rods out of the country. 
The people he's working with have turned against him. 
What do we know? 
Well, Farhad believes they want to use the rods to construct a dirty bomb and set it off somewhere here in New York City. 
Why would they do this? 
Between Hassan's crackdowns and CTU, we've backed them into a corner. 
This is their response. 
Do you believe him? 
Yes, I do. 
Farhad is turning himself in. 
He's agreed to help us prevent this attack. 
Where is Farhad now? 
He's in a warehouse just outside the city near Forest Hills. 
I've enlisted Jack Bauer to lock him down. 
Now, Madam President, the men who turned against Farhad are covert assets for the I.R.K. 
Now, if we can get access to the I.R.K. 
intelligence files, Farhad may be able to help us I.D. these men. 
It will put us that much closer to tracking them down. Those 
files are the lifeblood of Hassan's intelligence operation he'll never hand them over. 
Especially in his current frame of mind. 
Hell, the man's gone off the deep end. 
Well, maybe this will pull him out of it. 
Tell Hassan we have found his brother and I need to speak to him immediately. 
And contact Tim Woods at Homeland. 
Have him put together a briefing. 
I need to exactly what we're facing if, God forbid, this attack happens. 
Thank you, Mr. Hastings. 
I'll be in the counsel chamber. 
Yes, Madam President. 
Mr. Weiss. 
Yeah? 
Are we alone? 
Yeah. What is it? 
I want to let you know that I've decided not to pursue charges against Renee Walker. 
What? 
Why not? I told you... 
We have a lot more to worry about right now than blaming Walker. 
Walker murdered a valuable lead that might have gotten us to those nuclear rods. 
You're not hearing me. 
We have a new lead now Farhad Hassan and that is what I am pursuing. 
You want to replace me as head of CTU, be my guest. 
But until you do, stay the hell out of my way. 
Hastings, you're making... I'll let you know 
when Bauer reaches Farhad. 
Okay, Farhad Hassan is located on the northeast corner of the warehouse. 
We're gonna have to move fast, because he's injured. 
King, Lynch, you're gonna go in from the south. 
Owen and I will cover your flank. 
Understood. As soon as we've 
got him locked down, we're gonna initiate our interrogation. 
CTU's gonna upload files on probable suspects I need that available and on a computer as soon as possible. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Bauer, we're getting 
a call routed through CTU. 
It's Farhad Hassan. 
Put it on speaker. 
This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead. 
How close are you? 
Ten minutes out. Are you okay? 
There's someone here. 
They're close. 
They're looking for me. 
Please... hurry. 
Madam President. 
I'm told you have my brother. 
What happened? 
Please. 
He called CTU and surrendered himself. 
I don't understand. 
The men that Farhad was working with turned against him, and they have taken the nuclear rods. 
Now, he believes that they intend to construct a dirty bomb to attack this city. 
Now, apparently, these men are members of your covert intelligence operations here in the United States. 
I find that hard to believe. 
Well, your brother has no reason to lie. 
By turning himself in, he's facing the death penalty. 
We have to assume he's telling the truth. 
I need for you to give us intelligence files for every asset you have in this country so Farhad can identify these terrorists. 
Mr. President, 
I have given you a great deal of latitude to sort out your domestic situation, and now there is a threat to my homeland, and I need your cooperation. 
I suggest you turn Farhad over to me and let my people question him. 
We'll get the answers you need. 
There's no time for thate'a Cm moving on Farhad as we speak. 
They need to question him on site. 
I need the files. 
What you're asking is a serious breach of our security. 
I understand that. 
But you need to understand that if this radiological attack takes place, I will be forced to retaliate. 
You would attack... 
my country? 
I will have no choice. 
I need those files... 
and I need them now. 
I'll call my acting head of security. 
You'll get the files in a few minutes. 
Thank you. 
I want you to know, Tarin, that I don't believe you are guilty of treason. 
But I have no choice but to follow orders. 
You don't have to explain yourself, Nabeel. 
I would do the same thing in your position. 
I don't hold any of this against you. 
Whatever happens to me, you must not blame yourself. 
Never forget that. 
I appreciate that. 
Don't move. What 
are you doing? 
Nabeel, give me your weapon now. 
Slowly, two fingers. 
Come on. 
Driver, pull over here. 
Remove your seat belts. 
Put your hands on your head, both of you. 
Get out of the car now. 
Don't move. 
Give me the keys. 
Put your hands down. 
Tarin, don't do this. 
You'll only make things worse for yourself. 
You know what they'll do to me at our embassy. 
It can't be any worse. 
It's President Hassan. 
Give it to me. 
Come on! 
Let's go. In the back. 
Open it up. 
Take out your cuffs. 
Lock yourselves down. 
Nabeel isn't answering. 
Where is he? 
Transporting Tarin to the embassy. 
Keep trying to reach him on his mobile. 
If he doesn't answer, send a security team to track him. 
Yes, sir. 
And contact Colonel Al Jhanis. 
Tell him on my authority to give CTU access to the files they requested. 
Yes, sir. 
Hello. 
It's me. Where are you? 
I'm leaving the U.N. right now. 
Is everything all right? 
Yes, it worked. 
Meet me at the hotel. 
I'll be there in ten minutes. 
I love you, Kayla. 
I'll see you soon. 
Go ahead, Mr. Hastings. 
Farhad, are you there? 
Yes, yes, I'm here. 
Our field team is approaching the south entrance. 
Stay where you are until they secure the site. 
He's almost on me. 
I can't stay here. 
Do not move until they lock down that shooter. 
Do you understand me? 
Farhad? 
Farhad?! 
Farhad, talk to me. 
Over here! 
Medic! Come on! Medic! 
JACK: That's him, that's Farhad. 
Owen, take your team and sweep the area. 
Chloe, we've got Farhad, but he's been hit. 
I need those files immediately. 
I.R.K. intelligence 
just sent them over. 
Good. 
Yes? 
It's done. 
Farhad is no longer a problem. 
Are you sure? 
I shot him twice, but the police arrived, and I had to get out of there. 
You know where to find us. 
Yes. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Speak to me. We have two large 
caliber slugs to the abdomen. 
He's bleeding out. I don't think 
he's going to make it to the hospital. 
Do whatever you have to do to stabilize him. 
We need to talk to him now. Go! 
This is B team. 
We found their truck, but there's no sign of the rods. 
Let me know as soon as these files are uploaded. 
Mr. Hassan, in a few seconds, 
I'm going to show you photographs of covert operatives working for your country within the United States. 
I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you. Can you 
do that for us? 
Yes. 
Are those files uploaded yet?! 
Almost. Come on! 
Blood pressure's dropping. 
We've got a rapid heartbeat. 
What the hell's happening? 
He's going into shock. 
Give me 20 cc's epinephrine. 
You keep that man alive, do you understand me? 
Keep him alive! 
Let me do my job! 
The telepresence conference is ready, Madam President. Thank you. 
Good to see you, gentlemen. 
Madam President, Brian Hastings at CTU has brought us up to speed, and we're ready to review some specifics with you. 
Good. I'm listening. 
If you would refer to your monitor... 
and the diagram of Midtown Manhattan. 
According to CTU, the stolen nuclear rods have a maximum explosive yield of 300 pounds. 
That's enough radiological material to contaminate approximately one square mile. 
If the device were detonated in a more densely populated area of Manhattan, we could be looking at casualties in the tens of thousands. 
Dr. Landry? 
Most of the deaths would be from severe radiation poisoning. 
The remainder of the victims would expire from radiation induced illnesses. 
Primarily leukemia and other cancers. 
We also have to consider that the affected area would be rendered uninhabitable for approximately 40 years. 
Obviously a citywide evacuation is out of the question. 
That's right. There are 
millions of people on this island with few points of egress. 
It would take days to get them out. 
Not to mention that going public with this information would cause mass panic. 
I agree. We need to keep this 
threat from the public for now. 
Focus our efforts on making sure that this attack never happens. 
CTU believes the nuclear rods are still outside the city, so they're fortifying radiation detection efforts at the bridges and tunnels. 
We are also hardening high value targets such as the financial district, landmarks, subways. 
But we can't ignore that the U.N. may also be a target. 
Give the danger, I think we should evacuate the entire building. 
We can resume the conference from a safe location. 
All right, inform the delegates of the situation. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
CTU has your brother in custody. 
He's been shot. 
They're trying to stabilize him. 
Yes? 
Sir, Agent Rahim is calling for you. 
He says he's located Nabeel. 
Put him through. 
Mr. President, we found 
Nabeel and his driver locked down in the back of their vehicle. 
Tarin has escaped. What?! 
Nabeel wishes to speak to you, sir. 
Yes, okay, put him on. 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
Tarin had the gun with him. 
I don't understand how. 
Are you saying somebody helped him escape? 
It would seem so. 
But Mr. President, 
there's something else you need to know. 
Right after he escaped, I overheard Tarin on the phone. 
I believe he was speaking to your daughter. 
Kayla? Are you 
sure about this? 
Yes, sir. 
It sounded like he was going to meet her somewhere in the city. 
Kayla, call me back. 
Call me back, Kayla. 
Come inside. 
Oh, thank God, you're all right. 
Oh! 
I contacted an American lawyer I know who's an expert at international law. 
He's agreed to meet us in two hours. 
This is such a terrible situation. 
Yet I've never felt so happy. 
I feel the same. 
Mm! 
Mr. Bauer, we did our best. 
He didn't make it. 
I know you did. Thanks. 
We swept the area, sir. It's clear. 
No hostiles. No trace 
of the nuclear rods. 
Copy that. 
CTU, this is Bauer. 
We lost him. Farhad's dead. 
Damn it. 
I still think we've got another play. 
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed. 
We came up on him too fast. 
They don't know how badly he was wounded. 
So what are you proposing, Jack? 
I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait. 
Leak it to the press that we've got him in custody, and he survived. 
We're transporting him to a local hospital where authorities are going to question him. 
They'll have to make a move on him. 
He knows too much. 
Sounds like a Hail Mary. 
Right now it's the only play we've got. 
But if they make a move on Farhad, which I think they will, we'll be waiting for them. 
Mr. Hastings, you 
said you wanted me in till this was resolved. This is it. 
We have Hassan's intelligence files. 
We can scan and cross-reference with facial recognition software. 
Maybe spot the terrorists before they attack. 
All right, Jack. 
It's not exactly standard procedure ferrying a dead man's body across the city, but I'm willing to give it a shot. 
We'll figure out a hospital route and put a press statement together. 
You get ready on your end. 
Okay, thank you. 
Get that body ready for transport. 
Owen, assemble your men. 
Briefing in less than five. 
rial one is in position over the route, sir. 
Sniper teams have checked in. They're all in place. 
Come on, hurry up. 
Let's go. 
It's over, Dana. 
Let's get the other body and get cleaned up before we head back to CTU. 
Cole, what about us? 
I don't know. 
We have just received word from New York Counterterrorist Headquarters that Farhad Hassan- brother of Islamic Republic of Kamistan President Omar Hassan has been found alive. 
We're told that Farhad Hassan contacted CTU a short while ago and agreed to turn him over to authorities. 
Farhad is alive. 
What? 
CTU responded immediately, but when they arrived, they found him shot. 
No word yet on how Farhad Hassan sustained these gunshot injuries, but we do know that he is expected to survive, and he's being transported to St. Julian's Hospital 
under heightened security where he will be questioned by authorities. 
This is impossible. 
Farhad Hassan has been on the run since early this evening... 
I shot him twice. 
But you didn't make sure he was dead. 
I told you I didn't have time! 
I'll make this right. I'll go back. 
You're too conspicuous. 
Farhad will be heavily protected. 
But if Farhad talks, the authorities could find us before we can build the weapon. 
You think we don't know the implications? 
We're sending Marcos. 
His mother's American. 
They won't suspect him. 
He's in the truck with the rods. 
The peace treaty may now be halted due to a series of alleged terrorist attacks. 
Hello? 
Mom, it's me. 
Marcos? 
Yes. Listen, I 
can't talk for long. 
What is it? Are you okay? 
I'm fine, Mom. 
I need you to do something for me. 
It's very important. 
Okay. 
Okay. What is it? 
I need you to get up right now and leave the city. 
Go to Aunt Shelley's. 
Aunt Shelley's?! 
Just do it for me, okay? 
Don't ask me why. 
Leave right now. 
Marcos, this is crazy... 
I'm not gonna leave the apartment in the middle of the night for no reason. 
There's a reason; I just can't tell you what it is right now. 
Please, Mom, do this for me. 
Where are you? 
Don't worry about me. 
Well, I'm not going anywhere unless I know you're all right. 
I'll meet you at Aunt Shelley's, and I'll explain everything. 
Go, Mom, now. 
Okay, I'm leaving. 
I have to go. I love you. 
Are you ready, my friend? 
Yes. 
Good. 
It's time. 
You need to keep him looking alive the entire way. 
You're all clear on what you need to do? 
Yes, sir. 
Jack, it's Hastings. Go ahead. 
We've coordinated with news outlets. 
They put out the false report of Farhad's arrest and transport to the hospital for questioning. 
The hook has been baited. 
Okay. The most 
logical place for them to attack is when we're en route. 
That's where we're gonna be our most vulnerable. 
Well, NYPD and SWAT are mobilizing now. 
They're going to be embedded at strategic points along the way. 
They're also securing St. Julian's Hospital. 
Copy that. Tell 
the support teams it is imperative that we take these terrorists alive. 
They've been briefed, Jack. 
Okay, we're moving out. 
You two take the follow van. 
Owen, you're with me in the ambulance. 
Copy that. 
Hey, are you all right? 
Yes, sir. 
Look, I know you and your men have not had a lot of field experience, and we have put you in an extreme situation. 
But I promise you, if we're attacked, every part of this route is covered. 
We've got a lot of support out there. 
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer. 
Let's do this. 
Yeah. 
Our delegation is preparing to head to McGuire Air force Base. 
We'll be setting up a temporary ops center there, where we'll be able to monitor the situation. 
And the other delegates? 
U.N. Security will 
coordinate the evacuation. 
Everything should go smoothly. 
Can I get you anything, Madam President? 
No, thank you, Rob. 
You have done more than enough. 
I'm just sorry that your first few months on the job have been so challenging. 
I wouldn't have had it any other way. 
I'll see you in a moment. 
I spoke to one of my aides. 
He told me my brother is... dead. 
I'm afraid so. 
When CTU is finished with their operation, I would like Farhad's remains to be returned to my country. 
Personally, I don't care where his body rots, but my mother will want a proper burial. 
I'll see that it's done. 
But right now, Mr. President, 
we must all evacuate the U.N. 
I'm not leaving, Madame President. 
I'm staying here. 
I don't understand. 
My daughter Kayla is missing. 
Missing? 
Kayla is romantically involved with my former head of security. 
She's run off with him. 
Tell me what we can do to help. 
I appreciate that, but my security teams are searching for her now. 
I understand how worried you must be, but there is nothing that you can do to help her by staying here. 
Please come where you'll be safe. 
I can't, Madam President. 
She's somewhere in the city, with no idea that a nuclear threat exists. 
I won't go anywhere until she's been found. 
All right. 
I understand. 
I will talk to you very soon. 
Thank you. 
They're turning west Sixth Street. 
Pulling into the hospital. 
Chloe, bring up the hospital security feed. 
Get facial recognition up and running. 
CTU, this is Bauer. We're 
moving into position. 
Farhad's body's been taken to his room. 
Let's go! 
Secure these doors! 
Bring up the exterior cameras. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's me. 
Hey. 
I've been released. 
I'm free to go. 
Good. 
Chloe told me what you did. 
You leveraged Hastings. 
Said that you would head up field ops until this crisis was over in exchange for CTU dropping any possible charges against me. 
I didn't ask you to do that, Jack. 
I know you didn't. 
Look, someone in the White House is trying to set you up to take responsibility for the failure of our mission, and I couldn't let that happen because you did nothing wrong. 
You understand me? 
Renee, you need to let this go. 
You're not responsible for what's happening Yeah, okay. 
Hey, I meant what I said earlier. 
When this is over, I want to be there for you... 
with you. 
I'd like that. 
I'll have a CTU agent take you to my apartment. 
I'll meet you there when this is over. 
All right, Jack. 
Look, I'm getting chatter over the comm. I gotta go. 
Okay, bye. 
This is Bauer. Go ahead. 
Jack, facial recognition just picked up a match with the I.R.K. 
intelligence files. 
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar. 
American-born. 
Working undercover with the I.R.K. 
for the last three years. 
Where is he? 
Approaching the side entrance. 
Brown hair, blue scrubs, wearing aÃ© dark-blue jacket. 
Copy that. 
Hold on, Jack. he's got 
something in his hand. 
It looks like a remote detonator. 
I think he's wearing a vest. 
Chloe, can you disarm it from there? 
Possibly, if I can pin down the detonator model, I may be able to scramble the arming code using the transmitter in the mobile comm. 
Get on it. Owen, 
you've got a man approaching your position. 
He's got brown hair. 
He's wearing green scrubs and a blue jacket. 
Yeah. I see him. 
He's our hitter. We believe 
he's wearing an explosive vest with a remote detonator. 
Okay. What should I do? 
Stay calm and do whatever he asks. 
CTU techs are going to try and disarm the vest from offsite. 
Okay. 
Owen? 
Owen. 
You can do this. 
Just try and slow him down as much as possible. 
We've got you covered every inch of the way. 
Yes, sir. 
Excuse me. This 
is a secure area. 
I'm going to need to see some I.D. 
Listen to me very carefully. 
I have a bomb. 
Give me your weapon right now, or I'll kill us both. 
Your weapon now. 
Okay. Okay. 
Just take it easy. 
Slowly. 
Yeah. 
Where is Farhad Hassan? 
Third floor. 
Take me to him. 
Anyone asks who I am, you say I'm a doctor, and I'm cleared. 
Come on, son. 
Okay. 
Move. 
Okay. Go. 
Hello? 
Dalia, it's me. 
We need to talk. 
Don't try to change my mind, Omar. 
I told you, I'm leaving. 
I haven't called to change your mind. 
I called because Kayla may be in danger. 
What do you mean? 
She's run away with Tarin. 
They've been seeing each other. 
I know. 
How long have you known? 
What difference does it make, Omar? 
What kind of danger is she in? 
Farhad is dead. 
The nuclear material he tried to acquire is in the hands of the terrorists. 
They're going to use it here in Manhattan. 
No. 
How did this happen? 
I'll explain later. 
But right now you need to call Kayla. 
I've left messages, but she won't return my calls. 
But she might talk to you. 
Please, Dalia. 
She's angry at me. 
I had Tarin arrested. 
I thought he was part of the conspiracy. 
All right. 
But Omar, what about you? 
Don't worry about me. 
Just help me find our daughter. 
I- I'll try. 
Sabira, I need the captain. 
Chloe, it's Jack. We're 
moving to the third floor. 
Where are we at with the vest? 
I've identified the detonator, Jack. 
It's German-made, K7 variant, but that model is used in a lot of configurations. 
I'm going to need a visual on the vest. 
Copy that. 
Owen, it's Jack. 
CTU cannot disarm the vest unless they see it. 
I need you to get the hostile underneath one of the surveillance cameras and make him show it to you. 
I repeat, CTU cannot disarm the vest unless they see it. 
You ready? 
Team three, they're approaching your position. 
What are you doing? 
I want to see proof. 
Proof of what? 
A bomb. 
I don't believe you have one. 
You don't keep moving, you're gonna find out. 
Right now. 
You want Farhad, you show me. 
I said, "Move." 
No. 
Owen did it, Jack. 
I've got a visual on the vest. 
Now, move. 
Okay. 
We're set in position near Farhad's room. 
Now, what's the status? 
It's a DDR configuration. 
I just need to pull up the frequency of the receiver. 
Chloe, you've got about 30 seconds before they reach that room. 
Got it. 
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM. 
Running it through the mobile comm now. 
This'll take a few seconds. 
Stand by for assault. 
On the floor, face down! 
Do it now! 
Don't move! 
Come on, Arlo. Hurry up. 
That's it. It's done. 
Jack, the vest is disarmed. 
Move in. Go, go, go! 
It's all right. 
It's all right. 
Lower your weapons. 
It's all right. 
I'm going to put my gun away. 
We're not here to hurt you. 
We just want to talk. 
Stay calm. 
It's all right. 
I just want to talk to you. 
No. No! 
He's still moving. 
Notify the perimeter. 
Do not fire! He's unarmed! 
This is Bauer. 
I'm in the east wing. 
Suspect has barricaded himself in some kind of pressure chamber. 
I need a team down here now to help me open the door. 
Yes? 
It was a trap. 
Farhad was already dead. 
What? The police were waiting. 
They tried to ambush me, but I got away. 
Where are you? 
I locked myself inside some kind of oxygen chamber. 
They can't get in here. 
At least not yet. 
You know what you must do. 
I can't. 
I- I think they-they scrambled the arming code. 
You need to set it off manually. 
I don't know how to do that. 
I'll talk you through it. 
Can you open the detonator control? 
Yeah. I-I think so. 
Um, it's going to take a minute. 
Work quickly. 
You cannot let them take you alive. 
Can you hear me? 
I just want to talk.
