It's him. 
Damn it. 
(over headset): I couldn't get off a shot. 
Stand by. 
We'll get him on the way out. 
Manuel! 
Hey, Manny! 
Manny! 
Hey, Manny! 
WOMAN: Yes? 
Put Mauricio on the phone. 
Victor? Just put Mauricio on! 
He's dead. 
What? 
Someone shot him in the head. 
What the hell is happening? 
I see him. 
He's leaving the building. 
I'set. 
Stop. 
SPOTTER: It's not him. 
He can't be far. 
Coming at you! Gray sedan! 
Target is out of range. 
Move out. 
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency? 
Yes. I want to report a stolen vehicle. 
License plate SNE15C5. 
Jack? 
Oh. 
Sweetheart, we already talked about this, remember? 
You're supposed to call me "Grandpa." 
You don't look like a grandpa. 
Couldn't agree with you more. 
The cartoon I turned on is boring. 
Okay. We'll find another one. 
This is the boldest diplomatic initiative we've seen in a generation. 
It could finally lay a foundation for real peace throughout the entire region. 
Well, you know, Bob, the president's certainly betting her legacy on the success of these negotiations... 
Grandpa! 
This isn't a cartoon! 
Okay, okay. 
*A sloth of bears... âTª 
This one! I like this one! 
*A mob of cows âTª *A herd of sheep... âTª 
Yeah? 
Hi, Dad. Sorry we're late. 
They're redirecting everyone around the UN. 
It's all right. We're doing fine. 
How was the zoo? 
Well, to be honest with you, we spent most of our time just going back and forth between the black bears and the polar bears. 
I forgot to mention that she's going through a bear phase. 
Well, she certainly knows what she wants. 
She reminds me of you. 
Well, that's funny. 
I always tell Stephen how much she reminds me of you. 
Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes. 
Okay. Don't worry. 
We'll meet you in the lobby. 
Great. 
Sounds like they had fun. 
They always do. 
What's wrong? 
We talked to him about moving to LA the night we got here. 
Yeah. He said he'd think about it. 
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned one word about it since. 
And we leave tonight. 
Well, maybe he has to check with his doctors. 
No, they cleared him two weeks ag He's finished with treatme. 
I don't know. 
My father has been on his own for so long. 
Maybe he doesn't know how to live any other way. 
Why don't you just ask him again? 
My father is not the type of person you ask twice. 
If you want, I can do it. 
REPORTER: Here at e ited Nions, a White House spokesman just confirmed that Presiden Taylor and Hassan will be hoing a joint press conference later this hour. 
It is widely expected that President Hassan will announce the dismantling of his country's nuclear weapons program. 
esident Hassan has stated that he conside these negotiations a historic success and a new beginning for his country and the entire Mideast region. 
I believe that that is a reasonable compromise. 
Now, Mr. President, let's move 
on to the issue of verification. 
Now, the language in your latest proposal is vague. 
Let me be clear. 
My country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons with full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. 
But our terms, Mr. President, 
were that the inspectors themselves would be American, not IAEA. 
With respect, Madam President, your side pushed the point, but we never conceded. 
With respect, your side has refused to negotiate the point in good faith. 
Without Americans on the ground Surely, we're not going to let the nationality of a few hundred men ...verification has no teeth. 
So, only the United States can be trusted, Mr. Secretary? 
This is the message that you sent to the rest of the world and then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate. 
Farhad. 
Madam President, please excuse my brother's passion. 
He only wants what is best for our country. 
I understand. 
But we need to resolve this issue before we can move forward. 
And ideally, before the press conference, which gives us less than an hour. 
HASSAN: Madame President... 
what would your Congress say if my Revolutionary Guard was stationed on your soil? 
It's the same with my National Assembly. 
Even if I agreed to this, they would not ratify it. 
After all, I'm not a king. 
Nor I a queen. 
Too bad for both of us. 
I'd like to adjourn and discuss this issue with our respective teams. 
Of course. 
You are aware he was a salesman before entering politics. 
Household appliances. 
You want to bet he sold a lot of refrigerators? 
Find a way to give him what he wants. 
Madam President... 
You heard me. 
Try to make the inspections work. 
This man is a once in a lifetime leader. 
And he has already suspended his support for terrorist organizations, and privately, he's advocating for a two-state solution. 
How much further can we expect him to stick his neck out? 
Hey, come here. 
Did you name him yet? Bear. 
"Bear." KIM: There she is. 
Go get your mom. Hi! 
Hey! I heard that you 
and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears. 
Then we had ice cream, but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa gave me his. 
That's nice. STEPHEN: Here, I got her. 
Thanks for watching her, Jack. Of course. 
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about. 
And I've made up my mind. 
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you. 
Really? Yeah. 
I got a friend who's got a private security firm. 
Said he'd give me some consulting work. 
He's also got a place I can rent. 
Dad, I don't know what to say. 
Come here. 
You don't have to say anything. 
Just give me a ride to the airport tonight. 
Wait, you're coming with us tonight? 
If it's okay. 
Of course. Stephen. 
Yeah? He's coming with us tonight. 
And I've just got a few more things to pack. 
I don't have very much. 
I can be at your hotel in about an hour. 
That's perfect. We can get back 
and finish packing ourselves. 
It'll be all right if I fly back to Los Angeles with you? 
Yay! Yay! 
Come on. I'll walk you to the car. 
Okay. Let's go. 
Yay! I got her. 
Okay. *We're going in the car. âTª 
Get your belt done up... 
Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this. 
Me, too. 
I love you. Love you. 
Okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour. 
TERI: Okay. Bye, sweetheart. 
TERI: Bye! 
(gasps, groans) Good afternoon, everyone. 
Good afternoon. 
All right, just a few things before we get started here. 
Presidents Taylor and Hassan will each make a statement after they've been introduced by the Secretary-General. 
The Q&A will follow, but I want you to keep your questions strictly on topic. 
For obvious reasons, we're all operating under heightened security measures, so, unless you've been dying to know what a chokehold feels like, keep your credentials visible at all times. 
All right? 
That's all for now. 
Meredith Reed, press. 
It's invalid. 
What? 
It can't be invalid. 
Can you double check? 
I did, ma'am. Your credentials 
have been revoked. 
Revoked by whom? 
I don't have that information. 
Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake. 
You do remember me. 
I've been here every day. 
Please step aside, ma'am. 
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin. 
He's agreed to IAEAnspectors. 
That's good news. 
There is a condition attached. 
They're insisting that the head of the verification team be an American. 
I think we can live with that, don't you? 
You know where I stand. 
We've already surrendered too much in the name of peace. 
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad. 
And what have we surrendered really, apart from our nuclear ambition? 
Isn't that enough? 
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges is good for political maneuvering, but it's helping to bankrupt our country. 
The truth is, we are not the ones being so generous. 
President Taylor is lifting economic sanctions, and offering an aid package worth billions of dollars. 
We got everything we wanted, Farhad. 
As long as it's not a trick. 
Hello. 
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you 
with something so mundane, but I'm stuck outside. 
Stuck? 
My press credentials have been revoked. 
I dI'll take care of it. 
Are you sure? 
Of course. 
Thank you. 
Will you, uh, will you still have time for the interview later? 
Yes. After the press conference. 
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President. 
So am I. 
Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance. 
I was only... 
Just do it. 
Omar, people are starting to talk about you and this reporter. 
And saying what? 
Miss Reed is a journalist and she's profiling me for her newspaper. 
But you have feelings for her. 
I'm friendly with her. 
Think whatever you like. 
This woman poses no threat to me or the peace process. 
Not here maybe, but back in our country you'll be torn apart. 
The mullahs will say that you have been corrupted by the West. 
What do you say, Farhad? 
Have I? 
Have I been corrupted by the West? 
You know I don't believe that. 
But you are married. 
Dalia hasn't been a wife to me for a long time. 
That's no excuse to be reckless. 
I've done nothing reckless. 
I've done nothing reckless. 
Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now. 
I'll see to it. 
Victor. 
What are you doing here? 
How the hell did you find me? 
I was always resourceful, Jack. 
That's what you liked about me. Get in here. 
Take a seat. 
What happened? 
I need help. 
You need an ambulanc No, no, don't call. 
That's what he's waiting for. 
He's listening to the emergencchannels. Who? 
Just listen to me, Jack. I have information. 
The best I can do for you, Victor, is get you an ambulance. 
I'm out. I don't work for 
the government anymore. 
Oh, this you're going to want to hear. 
Why? 
Why? Because you're the guy who 
always does the right thing. 
There's a big hit going down. 
On who? 
President Hassan at the UN. 
He's getting taken out. 
When? Today. 
Before he can sign this thing with Taylor. 
You see? I told you you'd be interested. 
How do you know this? 
I'm the one that got the hitter into the country. 
I've been setting him up with what he needs. 
And then he tried to take you out. 
Look, Jack, you're the only one at CTU I ever did business with. 
I need you to call them, vouch for me, so I can cut a deal. 
Come on, Jack. 
(groans) Keep your seat. 
Look, I swear, this is real. 
Someone is trying to make sure that this peace agreement does not happen. 
I'm not doing anything until you give me your weapon. 
Better not be screwing with me. 
I'm not. I swear, I'm not. 
Who's the hitter? What's his name? 
Who's the hitter?! 
I don't know his name. 
He's Russian or something. Not good enough. 
Who is the hitter?! Look. 
I know how to find him and stop him before he makes the hit. 
But I'm not saying another word until I make my deal. 
You're lucky I'm retired. 
This is Cole Ortiz. 
Move Singer's team to the northeast quadnt, and tell him, from now on, I want updates every quarter hour. 
Get back to me with confirmations. 
Hastings wants you to expand the patrol perimeter around the UN another quarter mile. 
I'm glad that's what he wants, but I barely have enough men to cover the perimeter now. 
I'll see if I can get NYPD to help you cover. 
Uh, Dana? 
My sister she said she lt you a couple of messages. 
Something about bridesmaids' dresses. 
I told her there was probably something wrong with your voicemail. 
I got her messages. 
I just haven't had a chance. 
These double shifts... 
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN. 
Thought you might like to take a look at it before I distributed it. Yeah. 
Yeah, I do. I will call your sister 
back, I promise. 
Thanks. 
Damn it, what is the problem? 
Percussive maintenance? 
That's what my network apps professor called it when I hit my computer. 
Can I help? 
I just got the revised attendee list for the press conference. 
I can't get the facial recognition done in time. 
Oh, you're running each person through individually. 
You can do them in a batch. 
Not if the data's in different formats. 
Well, that used to be true, but here. 
Like I said, there's no reon to be shy out asking for help. 
Okay? Don't worry. 
You'll catch u You're doing great. 
Excuse me. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Jack. 
How's Kim? Did you tell her about LA? 
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now. 
I need to speak to the director. 
Mr. Hastings is on the phone, 
and he really doesn't like to be interrupted. 
Well, tell him it's regarding a plot to assassinate President Has See if that ts his attention. 
Oh. Okay, hold on. 
All right, now, give me an overlay on the UN, view from the west. 
Now, overlay the distribution of security teams, please. 
That looks good. 
Now, give me a comp with incident reports and satellite imaging. Excuse me, Mr. Hastings. 
Gary, hold on for a second. 
Jack Bauer's on line three. He says he nds 
to talk to you. Bauer? 
It's about a plot against President Hassan. 
I thought you'd want to take the call. 
Gary, I'll call you back. 
Mr. Bauer, thiss Brn Hastgs. 
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an 
informant that I used to run who's claiming he's got intel on an assassination attempt on President Hassan. 
He says it's going to take place today. 
We've received several ats in regard to the peace conference. 
I can only imagine. 
My informant's name Victor Aruz. 
I used him in the Salazar op. 
You should be able to pull his file Pull it up. 
He's been shot in the arm he claims byhe assassin. 
Look, I don't think this is something you should take lightly. 
And what does Mr. Aruz want 
in return for his information? 
CTU protection and immunity. 
That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer. 
Have you pulled his file yet? 
No. JACK: Mr. Hastings, 
I know this son of a bitch, and my instinct is telling me that you need to pay attention to this. 
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer. 
CTU isn't the organization you knew. 
Okay, fine, but understand this: If anything happens to President Hassan, I will be obligated to call President Taylor and tell her that I tried to provide you with this intel, and you ignored it. 
What is taking so long for the file? 
Sorry. I'm still searching 
through the archives. 
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now. 
Are you bringing Aruz in or not? 
(sighs) Let me talk to him. 
I'll put you on speaker. 
Go ahead. 
Mr. Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details 
to corroborate your story. 
The hitter took out two of my guys. 
Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez. 
Check with t cops. 
We will. 
Mr. Bauer, 
where are you? 
1145 West 18th. 
I'll send a chopper to pick you up. 
The closest helipad to you is... the 12th precinct. 
That's five blocks away. 
Can you t him there, Mr. Bauer? 
Yeah. 
I'll have a team there in 20 minutes. 
Make sure you don't use official channels. 
We believe the assassin is monitoring emergency bandwidth. 
Got it. 
Gather comm and tactical, tell them we've got a situation. 
JACK: Let's go. 
There you are. 
Now that doesn't suck. 
Arlo. 
Yeah. 
Come on. Hastings called 
an emergency briefing. 
And if he ever catches you doing that, you're gonna be out of a job. 
Be worth it. 
I think this mig be love. 
Now. 
This is CTU transferring control of drones A31 and 32 to HS aerial command. 
Yeah, roger that. 
Offload confirmed. 
l right, we've got a situation. 
Cole, I need you to scramble a chopper for a pickup. 
Yeah. I haven't finished distributing 
the new patrol parameters. 
This is a priority. 
Who am I picking up? 
Someone who claims to have intel about a threat to President Hassan. 
How good is the intel? 
Well, according to Jack Bauer, very. 
Jack Bauer? 
He's delivering the informant. 
Who is Jack Bauer? 
Location downtown; Chloe's sending you the coordinates. 
Take a small team with you. 
Torres' people are free. 
Yes, sir. And I'll need a second 
team to secure the landing. 
One team will be enough. We'll use a drone 
to protect the ground operation. 
Arlo, scramble a drone alongside the chopper. 
Full spectrum coverage of the landing zone as well as the air corridor. 
Done. 
We're clear. 
Dispatch, this is Unit 2354. 
DISPATCH: Go ahead, 2354. 
Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle. 
(various overlapping radio communications) (tuning in):...03 Pontiac. 
Plate: Sierra, November, Echo, one, five, Charlie, five. 
Got bullet holes in the windshield and body. 
That's him. 
DISPATCH: Roger that. 
What's yr location? 
Vee's parked o18th, just west of Ninth Avenue. 
We'll take care of it. 
Will you? 
Or am I going to have to step in? 
Now would be the time to tell me. 
Aruz is a dead man, sir. 
You have my word. 
Good. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me, Madam President. 
President Hassan accepted our counterproposals on inspections. 
That is great news. 
By the end of this next session, we may have a signed agreement. 
It's an extraordinary accomplishment, Allison. 
(sighing) Is something wrong? 
I was thinking about Henry. 
Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement with the Islamic Republic was was something that he and I talked about years ago. 
I wish that he were here to share the moment. 
You surprised? 
Considering his behavior during the divorce, yes, I am surprised. 
He went out of his way to hurt you, especially in the press. 
He was angry, Ethan. 
I sent our daughter to prison. 
You refused to cover up a murder. 
Olivia was responsible for what happened no one else. 
Still, if the the situation had been reversed, I might've felt the same way as Henry. 
Sorry if I'm interrupting, but I just talked to Brian Hastings at CTU. 
What's going on, Rob? 
They have someone who claims he's got information about an assassination plot on Hassan. 
How real is the threat? 
Real enough to loop you in. 
This informant came to them through Jack Bauer. 
I thought that Jack was out of all of this. 
How did he get involved? 
As far as I can tell, this informant came to him. 
We'll know more once the informant signs an immunity deal, provided you authorize it. 
How secure is the venue for the press conference? 
Very. And I just raised the alert level. 
But we need to set up a call to inform Hassan about the threat, ideally before the conference gets started. 
We can't tell Hassan. 
Certainly not before the press conference. 
Why not? 
Well, he might scuttle everything, out of concern for his own safety. Hassan's a big boy. 
He's used to taking risks or he wouldn't be here; you know that. 
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew about this and didn't tell him, then all the trust we've built up over the last year goes out the window, and then he'll pull out of talks. 
And frankly, I wouldn't blame him. 
I'll think about it. 
Thank you both. 
Madam President, I'm telling you, holding this back from Hassan could be disastrous. 
I said I'd think about it, Rob. 
Thank you. 
Ethan... 
Listen-- sorry if I went after you a little hard in there. 
Uh, I was just making my point. 
No need to apologize, Rob. 
I recommended you to the President because you're not afraid to speak up. 
She needs that. 
Yeah, well, still, I know I can get carried away; I... 
Don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet. 
I can handle mysf. 
Even up against you. 
Hey, sweetheart, it's me. 
Hey, we're almost finished packing. 
Are you on your way? 
Something came up. 
I'm gonna be a little late. 
How late? 
I think I should meet you at the airpo. 
Is everything okay? 
Yeah. 
Are you sure? 
Kim, I promise everything's fine. 
Well, Teri is so excited that you're coming back with us. 
Just, uh, let me know when you're on your way. 
Okay, thanks, sweetheart. 
Keep your eyes open. 
The precinct's two blocks away. 
Let's cut through here. Come on. 
The FAA's cleared a route and informed all relevant agencies that we will be in the air. 
Good luck. 
Aruz's file-- it was in a proprietary database. 
That's why it took so long. 
Still, that shouldn't have thrown you you've been here a month. 
Almost a month, and I've had to relearn the interface on every major system here; everything's changed. 
And you're having trouble adapting, I understand. 
But I don't think it's a question of your intelligence. 
Thanks. 
I think it's ambivalence. 
Ambivalence?! 
I know the only reason you only took this job was because your husband was downsized. 
Am I wrong? No! 
I mean, yes. 
Please, just give me a little more time to get up to speed here. 
Mr. Hastings, I need this job. 
Fair enough. 
But I'm all about efficiency, so if your performance doesn't improve, you may want to rethink working here. 
Now, I trust this has been clarifying. 
Sure. 
If you really wanted to be more efficient, why don't you just say if I don't catch up soon, I'm going to be fired? 
Your flight path is a straight shot southwest over the river, and the 12th Precinct has confirmed that their helipad is clear and operational. 
Comm net and satellite coverage of your flight, both legs, and fulltime aerial from the drone Why are you looking at me like that? 
Like what? 
Look, I just want to make sure nothing's wrong. 
Nothing's wrong, like I said. 
Just be careful, okay? 
I will be. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
You know, maybe she should finally set a date. 
She's getting cold feet. 
How about you shut up and just focus on your assignment? 
Come on, Victor! 
Victor? Victor! 
Stay with me. 
Victor, stay with me! 
Stay with... 
Damn it. 
Stay with me! 
We're going to need to recompress the wound. 
TV REPORTER: If successful, the agreement could be the beginning of a real lasting peace in a lon g-troubled region. 
Presidents Taylor and Hassan are scheduled to give their first joint press conference in just a few minutes, and we'll carry that live. 
In a moment, Christiane Doumany will have a report on the history of the many failed attempts at a Mideast peace, and why this accord may be different. 
It's time to go. 
Tell your father I'll be right there. 
I'll wait until you're done. 
He doesn't trust me to be on time. 
Of course he trusts you. 
When did you become such a good liar? 
You don't have to defend your father, Dalia. 
He can take care of himself. 
You look beautiful, Dalia. 
And you look handsome. 
Let's not pretend any more than we have to. 
I'm sorry you had to see that. 
It's not your fault. 
My dear Kayla. 
We should go. 
Yes. 
Let her through. 
Thank you. 
I will tell you the same thing that I told him. 
Unless you want to destroy everything that he's worked for, stay away from him. 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
President Hassan is on his way. 
You're not going to tell him he's being targeted. 
Madam President, I'm sorry. 
You risk destroying in a single day all the-- Rob, you've made your point. 
More than once. 
And believe me, I don't like keeping this from President Hassan any more than you do. 
Then tell him. 
Mr. President. 
Ladies. 
You've met my chief of staff? 
Of course. 
Hello, Mr. President. 
I haven't had the chance to thank you for compromising on the verification issue. 
It was the right thing to do. 
If you don't mind, I'd like to brief you both on the format of the press conference. 
The Secretary-General will be introducing you both after some brief remarks. 
The conference itself shouldn't take any longer than 25 minutes or so. 
Put your hand on it. 
Let's go. 
We're almost there. 
MAN: Don't move! 
Got a call that you two are having a problem down here. What's up? 
Officer, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm transporting this man on behalf of CTU. 
He's an informant vital to national security. 
Call it in. Listen to me. 
The men that are trying to kill him are monitoring all emergency channels. 
Do not let him make that call. 
Shut up and get against the Dumpster. 
Now! 
At least take us into the precinct. 
We can verify everything there. 
Get down, now! 
Damn it! 
I'm going to cover you. 
Make a run for the door. 
You ready? Go! Go! 
I'm out of bullets. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
How far out is the helicopter? 
Two minutes. Jack, what's wrong? 
We're under attack. 
I need you to put me in touch with whoever's in command of that unit. 
Okay. It's Agent Ortiz. 
He's the head of field ops. 
Is there a problem? Yes. 
Mr. Hastings, we have a 
situation with the pickup. 
Keep going to the roof. Now. 
Don't stop for anything. 
Keep going. 
Agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer. ORTIZ: Roger. 
What's going on, Mr. Bauer? 
We're being pursued by two shooters. 
There's no way we're going to make the precinct. 
We're in a building on West 21st, three doors in from Ninth Avenue. 
We're heaWe're lookingposition for an alternate pickup.ne. 
Copy that. 
Right there-- the roof of that parking structure might work. 
Can you zoom in closer? 
The satellite's refreshing. 
It'll take a minute. 
I'm moving the drone there now. 
There's a parking structure next to the building you're in. 
Roof looks clear to land. 
DANA: Did you get that, Cole? 
Yeah, I see it. Mr. Bauer, 
looks like you can access that roof from the eighth floor of the building you're in. 
How far out are you? 90 seconds. 
Copy that. 
Don't be late. 
Victor... Victor, listen to me. 
You got to tell me everything you know about the hitter, so I can call it in in case we don't make it. 
If I don't make it, I don't care what happens. 
Get me to CTU. 
You always were a son of a bitch. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Stay there. 
Lock down access points to the roof! 
Where are the hostiles? They're dead. 
You need to get him out of here. 
He's losing a lot of blood. 
Cole Ortiz. It's an honor to meet you. 
Thanks for doing this. 
Look, Hastings wants to debrief you back at CTU. 
I'm not going back to CTU. 
I delivered him, I'm done. 
No, Mr. Bauer... I got a flight to catch. 
That's it? 
Get down! 
Ortiz, report in. 
CHLOE: Agent Ortiz? 
Agent Ortiz, what's your status? 
Agent Ortiz? 
Jack, come in. 
Jack, can you hear me? 
Anyone, come in. 
Victor. 
Victor, Victor, come on. 
Stay with me, stay with me. 
Listen to me. 
You don't want to die like this. 
Do the right thing. 
Tell me what you know. 
The hitter has someone on the inside. 
Close to Hassan. 
Give me a name Give me a name. Give me a name! 
Victor... 
Victor, who's on the inside? 
Victor! 
Come on. 
Come on, come on. 
No. 
He's dead. 
No. 
The brother revoked my clearance, but I had Hassan reinstate it. 
No, I know. 
I know I'm behind schedule. 
But it'll get done.
