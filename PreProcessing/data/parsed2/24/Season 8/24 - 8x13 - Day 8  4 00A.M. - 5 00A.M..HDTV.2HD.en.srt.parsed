u know him, don't you? 
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle 
of a national security crisis. 
I have to go back to my desk. 
Okay, perhaps if I talk to your supervisor, he could let you take a few minutes off. 
It's over. 
The parole officer looking for Kevin is here in CTU. 
He's after the raw feed. 
I'm gonna give it to him, Cole. 
Why don't you wait? 
Do you hear me? 
He knows everything; he'll go to Hastings. 
Do what he says and you won't get hurt. 
Who is he? 
Another traitor? 
The only traitor is your father. 
We haven't disabled the American radiological detectors yet. 
Where are the nuclear rods? 
They're still outside the city. 
How will you bring the rods to me? 
It's been taken care of. 
Let's go! 
Stop them! 
Tarin, no! 
Oh! 
Mr. Hastings, you better 
take this; it's Kayla Hassan! 
She's in a car; she's escaped. 
They tried to kill me, but Tarin got me out. 
They shot him. 
He told me to call CTU! 
Ms. Hassan, 
my name is Jack Bauer. 
We need to know where you were being held. 
We got the location, Jack. 
Targets are heading north on Orchard. 
They're getting into an SUV. 
We ID'd one of the targets as Tarin Faroush; Kayla said he sacrificed himself to save her, but he's still alive. 
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into-- where is it now? 
Taking the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge. 
You've gotta put Hastings on now. 
I'm on, Jack. 
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in. 
The terrorists faked her escape. 
They wanted to get her to CTU. 
She's in the tunnel. 
Stop the car! 
Whoa, whoa! 
Put your hands where we can see them! 
It's an EMP! 
What the hell's happening? 
Contact NSA. 
Terrorists just took down CTU. 
Central comm node is totally fried. 
Reroute to peripherals. 
I already tried that. 
Try again, Chloe. 
Sir, I can't give you the status on the drones. 
Everything's down. 
Which means what? 
That they're going to fall out of the sky? Not yet. 
The nav systems should default to autopilot. 
They'll circle until they run out of gas. 
But we've lost all aerial surveillance and radiological detection capability. 
Basically. 
All right. 
Agent Skaggs is heading outside on foot. 
Have him contact FAA with the drones' default flight paths. 
They need to be taken down before they crash into populated areas. 
Yes, sir. 
Are you okay? 
Am I okay? 
An EMP just took us out of play and now we're dropping the ball on a radiological threat against New York City. 
So, no, Chloe, I am not okay. 
And I won't be until we find those rods. 
Sir, Kayla Hassan is finished in Medical. 
Okay, I need her taken back to the UN so she can be evacuated with her family. 
Okay, I'll do it. 
No, I'll do it. 
I need you to assemble division heads. 
Tell them that we have a briefing in ten minutes. 
Tell them to come with full damage assessment reports. 
Sir, their systems are down. 
They can't generate reports. 
Then tell them to use a pen and a damn legal pad. 
Phil Holden. 
Phil, it's Jack Bauer. 
Ah, Jack, I heard you were back in play. 
Phil, look, I don't have a lot of time, I need you to listen to me carefully. 
Go ahead. There's an IRK 
splinter cell trying to smuggle weapons-grade uranium into the city. 
Yeah, I just read the threat assessment. 
It says you've got a CTU team tracking them. 
We did, but we lost them. 
CTU just got hit by some electromagnetic pulse device, wiped out all our visual and comm. 
I want you to try and locate our hostiles with one of your satellites. 
We don't have any birds over the metro area, Jack. 
All aerial surveillance was being routed through CTU. 
What about traffic cams? 
I can try. 
Give me the hostiles' last location. 
They got off the Williamsburg Bridge at the West Broadway/ Roebling Street exit. 
They're driving a gray SUV. 
I'll call you if we get a hit. 
Phil, I also need you to shut down all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city. 
Thanks. 
Done. 
Where are you going? 
NSA's shutting all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city. 
There's only one way for them to get in. 
Across the East River. 
That's right. 
CTU is down. 
You have confirmation? 
I have a real-time uplink to the power grid. 
It recorded a pulse surge and now nothing. 
CTU is blind, deaf, and dumb. 
Have you secured this area? 
As you ordered. 
You've done well, Ali. 
Thank you, sir. 
Load the rods into the Zodiac. 
I realize this was very difficult for you, but Hassan's daughter was a necessary sacrifice. 
Using her was the only way for us to get the rods into the city. 
Agents Beck and Henderson will escort you back to the UN. 
First, tell me what's going on. 
Agent Beck will brief you on the way. 
Now, once you're there, we need you to do something for us. 
Your father gave us a file of IRK covert agents operating in this country. 
We need you to identify the men working with Tarin. 
I'm not doing anything until you tell me what's happening. 
The car you drove here was rigged with an EMP device. 
It's a pulse weapon designed to disarm electronics. 
It's crashed all our systems. 
I don't understand. 
Tarin put me in that car. 
He used you, Ms. Hassan. 
He staged your escape, put you in that car, and sent you back here. 
But he was shot. 
I saw him. 
He is alive. 
We spotted him a few minutes ago. 
I know it's a lot to take in, but you need to go with these agents back to the UN and start looking through those files. 
You've seen these terrorists. 
If you can help us to ID them, we stand a chance of finding them before they carry out their attack. 
Ahman has prepared the bomb. 
It'll be short work once we get the rods across the river. 
MAN (over radio): A vehicle is coming. 
Where is it? 
It's coming from the east. 
Black SUV, no markings. 
How many men have you got covering? 
Three. 
Wait until the SUV's in the range, then take them out. 
Ali! Come! 
Hold on. 
What is it? 
Thought I caught something in the infrared. 
Heat source down by the water. 
Now it's gone. 
See if NYPD can get some units down here. 
I'll contact NSA, see if they've got surveillance of the area. 
That's weird. 
I got four bars, but the call's not going through. 
Me neither. 
We're being jammed. 
They're here. Damn it! 
Get down now! 
(engine cranking) Come on! 
The engine's down. 
Pass your weapons up front! 
Cole, I want you to take the sniper to your north. 
Maintain coverage until we're clear. 
I want both of you to get ready to unload all the weapons from the back, you ready? 
Yes, sir. 
Let's go, go, go! 
How did they know where to look for us? 
They must have followed us from the vault. 
Cole, use your infrared! 
Call out the snipers as you see them! 
Ten o'clock, high and low! 
I'm counting four men. 
I recognize one from the hospital. 
He was the one that talked Marcos out of detonating the vest. 
It's Jack Bauer. 
Ex-CTU. He was one 
of their best agents. 
Nine o'clock low! 
We can still cross with the rods. 
As long as we're certain Bauer and his men cannot warn anyone. 
It's not a risk. 
We started jamming their communications as soon as they were in sight. 
Now they can't leave. 
Not with the snipers in position. 
Good. 
Make sure none of them get out alive. 
I'll call you when we're across the river. 
Let's move. 
Reloading! 
I've got two men, leaving the dock in a boat. 
One of them is Tarin Faroush. 
They're carrying a box the right size and shape for the rods, Jack. 
Copy that! 
Went out of my range. 
We got to notify NYPD before they cross the river. 
I tried cell and radio frequencies. 
They're all jammed. 
There's a call box mounted on the building. Ten o'clock. 
It's gotta be a hard line. 
We can call from there. 
How do we get there? 
The way the shooters are positioned, they'll pick us off one by one as soon as we step out from behind the vehicle. 
Our vehicle's armored. 
We can pull the panels, use them for coverage. 
Start now! 
Eleven o'clock, Jack! 
Casualty reports are also coming in. 
Three fatalities from the bomb blast in the motor pool tunnel. 
Damn it. 
What else? 
Minor injuries for the most part. 
Agent McCallan was burned in a small electrical fire. 
How is he? 
He's going to be okay. 
But with our infirmary down we had to transport him to the local hospital. 
Says here we have flooding. 
Yes, sir, the pumps are down, and certain sections of the basement have about six inches of water. 
Well, can you stop it or are we all going to drown? 
The repair crew's working on it, sir. 
Okay, give me another update in 20 minutes. 
Excuse me, sir? 
Yes, what is it? 
A team from NSA is here. 
NSA? 
Brian Hastings, director of CTU. 
Frank Haynam, senior engineer at the New York field office. 
I understand you've been hit by an EMP. 
Yeah, that's right. 
I hope that you're here to help because we can damn well use it. 
We are indeed. 
Brought my best men with me. 
I thought we'd start by restoring your aerial surveillance and communications. 
So, where's your server room? 
It's downstairs. 
I'll let my maintenance team know what you're here. 
You boys can put your heads together. 
I prefer to work with my own people. 
There's no one more familiar with this facility than my crew. 
Not exactly true. 
I was part of the group that helped design this place. 
Can't say I'm thrilled with what you've done with it. 
How did you find out we were hit? 
Jack Bauer called our regional headquarters. 
Told us your situation. 
Bauer was pursuing the men behind this attack when we lost contact with him. 
Do you know where he is? 
NSA's been trying to call him back. 
He's not answering. 
They're not sure why. 
Right this way. 
Chloe, we're supposed to be writing damage assessments. 
What are you doing? 
There might be away to tap in, get some of our systems up and running. 
Really? How? 
I haven't figured it out yet, and I won't if you keep talking to me. 
All right, people, listen up. 
This is Frank Haynam, senior engineer of the NSA's New York field office. 
Now, he and his team are going to help us restore aerial surveillance and communications. 
So we can get back to tracking the nuclear rods. 
They also brought along a fresh batch of cell phones. 
Give them your full cooperation. 
Whatever they need, make it happen. 
Now, we have been knocked down, but I promise you, we are going to get back up. 
Let's get to work. 
Agent Blochard, can you get Mr. Haynam and his team 
down to the server room? 
Has NSA heard from Jack? 
Yeah. They spoke with Jack 
and his team about 20 minutes ago, but haven't been able to reach him since. 
Why not? 
They don't know. 
He could be in some kind of trouble. 
You need to send men out looking for him. 
Even if I had agents available, I wouldn't know where to send them. 
Jack was heading toward the East River. 
That's four square miles of real estate too much for me to commit resources that we don't have. 
He was pursuing the terrorists. 
He's our best chance at stopping this attack. 
We're going to focus on our efforts here. 
When we get our eyes and ears back, we'll find them. 
It might be too late. 
If anyone can take care of themselves, it's Jack. 
Now, I want you to go to the server room, make sure Haynam has everything he needs. 
Worse than I thought. 
90% of these components are fried. 
We're going to have to swap them out and install new server boards. 
Mr. Haynam. 
I'm Chloe O'Brian. 
Mr. Hastings wanted me to make 
sure you have everything you need. 
We're fine, Ms. O'Brian. Thank you. 
You're going in through the CLR processor? 
That's right. 
We're going to isolate it from the main servers and create a brand-new subnet. 
Creating a brand-new subnet from scratch? 
That'll take forever. 
Ms. O'Brian, thanks 
for offering your help. 
We'll take it from here. 
Look, I think there's another way. 
I've been looking at the CTU schematics. 
Why not tap directly into the trunk line? 
Because I'm not insane. 
Mr. Haynam, we need to make sure 
those nuclear rods don't get into the city. 
What I'm suggesting wille a lot faster. 
Yeah, and it could make things a whole lot worse. 
How could things be any worse? 
You reopen that trunk line without system buffers in place, you could cause an overload, wind up electrocuting yourself, not to mention starting a fire that canurn down half the building. 
I'm aware of the risks. 
I think I can create a workaround. 
You couldn't keep an EMP from taking out your whole operation. 
Forgive me if I don't bow to your expertise. 
If you'd stop with the cheap insults and just listen to me. 
Look, I'm not here to brainstorm. 
I'm here to clean up your mess. 
You need to leave. 
Now. 
I said now, Ms. O'Brian. 
I won't ask you again. 
Start prepping the CLR for a diagnostic. 
Arlo, is there any other way to get into the trunk line besides the server room? 
No, that's the only way in. Why? 
I think I have a faster way to get us back online, but Haynam says it's too dangerous. 
I think he's a raging egomaniac. 
Seems to be a prerequisite for engineers these days. 
You talk to Hastings? 
If I tell Hastings, he'll just shoot me down. 
Maybe not. 
And maybe the moon will fall from the sky. 
Just let it go. 
These NSA guys seem to know what they're doing. 
And if they don't, what happens to Jack? 
What's Jack got to do with this? 
(sighs) Never mind. 
Hello? 
Renee, it's Chloe. 
Where are you? 
I'm at Jack's apartment. 
What's going on? 
Everything. 
All of our systems CTU was hit bare down. 
It's a real mess. 
How did that happen? 
I can't go into it right now, but we think the terrorists were trying to take out our radiological detectors. 
Where's Jack? 
That's why I'm calling you. 
I think he might be in some kind of trouble. 
We need to find him. 
Slow down, Chloe. 
Uh, what-what do you mean? 
What-what kind of trouble? 
Jack was tracking the terrorists when the EMP hit. 
Uh, whHe called NSA, mean? 
and they lost contact, too. 
Does Hastings know about this? 
He's the one who told me. 
What's he doing about it? 
Nothing. 
He won't send anyone out to look for them. 
He says he can't spare the men and that Jack can take care of himself. 
Where was Jack before you lost contact? 
He took the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge. 
I'm going to try to find him, Chloe. 
You need to get CTU back online as soon as you can. 
Once you acquire Jack's position, you can direct me to him. 
Yeah, well, that might take a while. 
NSA brought in a repair team and they're going about it all wrong. 
I have a faster way to get us back online. 
Well, then tell them. 
I tried. 
They won't listen. 
Then you need to make them listen, Chloe. 
Do what you have to do. 
Okay. I will. 
Call me when you're back up. 
The EMP took out all of our systems. 
And since we don't know how long it's going to be until we're up and running again, we're going to have to evacuate all nonessential personnel. 
You're going to follow Agent Combs through our access tunnel. 
I need to speak with Mr. Prady, please. 
Thank you. 
Please. 
Yeah. 
I'm really sorry that it took me so long to get back to you. 
I've been a little busy. 
I know. They briefed me 
on what happened. 
It's a terrible thing. 
Yes. 
And I have some bad news because of it. 
The surveillance video that you wanted has been erased by the EMP. 
Erased? 
Yes. 
Everything in the building has been fried. 
Well, that's a damn shame. 
So what you're telling me is whoever helped Kevin Wade rob that evidence locker they just caught a huge break. 
I'm afraid so. 
Are you sure that it was all erased, Ms. Walsh? 
I mean, don't you have a backup system? 
Yes, yes, we do, but it's on-site. 
And like I told you, all the servers have been wiped clean. 
I know how much Kevin means to you. 
I really wish I could do more. 
So you're sure that there's nothing else you can tell me? 
Anything that would help me find Kevin? 
Believe me, I have told you everything that I know. 
I'm sure you have. 
Mr. Prady, I really have 
to get back to work. 
Good luck finding Kevin. 
I hope that he's okay. 
Me, too. 
If anything changes with those files, I'll be in Little Rock. 
You have my number. 
Of course. 
I hope you get your lights back on. 
Mr. Haynam, I think 
I found a way to deal with the safety concerns you had with my idea. 
Here's the workaround. 
I thought I made myselear. 
We're not going anywhere near that trunk line. 
I'm going to ask you one last time. 
We really need to do this my way. 
We have agents in the field who are close to finding the nuclear rods and they need our help. 
And I'm going to ask you one last time. 
Get out of here. 
Get out or I'll call security! 
You get out. 
Now. 
What the hell... 
All of you, get out now. 
Look, look, take a second to think. 
Do you really want to do this? 
Mr. Haynam, 
I don't want to hurt you. 
You're probably an okay guy when you're not at work. 
And you're wearing a wedding ring. 
I swear to God, if you don't leave right now, I will shoot you. 
Get out! 
Go! 
Go get Hastings and tell him to bring security. 
They're starting to flank us! 
We're almost there! 
Jack, they're almost on us. 
We cannot stay here! 
Just give me one more second. 
Okay... 
Okay, I'm ready. 
We're gonna use these plates to form a way so that we can make it over to the call box. 
Remember, we need to move slow and steady. 
It is imperative that we stick together for this to work. 
You understand? 
Yes, sir. 
No matter how difficult it gets out there, this armor is gonna protect us. 
You need to trust that. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes. Okay. 
Cole, you're with Agent King. 
Owen, you're with me. 
Let's go! 
The armor's not gonna hold up. 
Yes, it is. 
Maintain formation. 
Can you get a shot? 
Not from this angle. 
It's not holding up. 
We gotta go for it. 
Yes, it is. Slow down! 
We're almost there. Move! 
No! 
No, no! 
(King groaning) There's nothing we can do for him now. 
We can't just leave him there. 
I'm with Owen. 
We don't leave our men behind. 
You try and bring him in now, you're dead. 
They're trying to draw us out. 
Best thing we can do for him is make it to the hard line and try and call for help. 
We're almost there. 
You cover the north, Owen the east. 
I can get there. 
Owen! 
Owen! 
Cover him! 
I'm sorry. 
I couldn't leave him behind. 
You did great. 
Is he all right? 
Did he make it? 
Did he make it?! 
Yeah, he made it. 
Come on. Stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
Jack, they're repositioning. 
Stay on them. 
Are you all right? 
Yes. 
Are you sure? 
Yes, Mother, I'm okay. 
I'm so sorry, Father. 
(sobbing): I'm so sorry. 
You were right about Tarin. 
I should have listened to you. 
You are safe. 
That's what's important. 
Mr. President, 
CTU is preparing a subterranean evacuation route. 
If there is a radiological attack, you'll be shielded underground. 
When do we leave? 
As soon as possible. 
President Taylor's waiting for you with the other delegates. 
The files Mr. Hastings 
requested are inside. 
Thank you, sir. 
Kayla, go with them. 
She's strong. 
She'll be all right. 
We almost lost her. 
And I... almost lost you. 
All for a peace agreement that could fall apart at any moment. 
And it will only get more difficult, Dalia. 
My enemies will be waiting for me once we return home. 
Omar... 
Despite everything that's happened, there's one thing I've never doubted. 
That what you are doing here is an absolute good. 
You have to be strong, too. 
We need to get in there fast before O'Brian can do any more damage. 
I understand the situation, Mr. Haynam. 
How long? 
I just need to drill into the locking mechanism. 
It shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. 
This woman is out of her mind. 
Where the hell do you find these people, Hastings? 
I can't believe she pulled a weapon on me. 
She was ready to use it, too. 
I seriously doubt that. 
I'm sure she was just trying to scare you. 
Yeah? Well, she did 
a very good job. 
You wanted to see me, sir? 
Yes, O'Brian's going off the deep end. 
She thinks she knows how to get the CTU up and running. 
But she's locked herself in the server room to do it. 
We'll be in there in a few seconds. 
What's she trying to do? 
She's trying to tap directly into the trunk line, which I don't have to tell you, is a catastrophe waiting to happen, Stop what you're doing, Chloe! 
Let's see the gun. 
Okay, don't shoot or anything. 
I know what I did is crazy. 
I know I'm in a lot of trouble. 
You're damned right. 
I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it could work. 
I'm almost done. 
I just need ten more minutes. 
Get her out of here now. 
Do me a favor: let me give the orders. 
She pulled a gun on me! 
I know what she did. 
Now just shut up and let me handle it. 
Chloe, what in the hell were you thinking? 
Jack's looking for those nuclear rods and he might need our help. 
I can get satellite and comm back up. 
I just need to finish tapping into that trunk line. 
I told Mr. Haynam, 
but he wouldn't listen. 
So I pulled a gun on him. 
I didn't want to. 
I don't even like guns. 
Dana, what's your take on this? 
Mr. Haynam is right. 
Tapping into the trunk line is dangerous and there's no guarantee that it'll work. 
What about Cole? 
He could be in trouble. 
Aren't you worried about him? 
Yes, I am. That's why I can't 
go along with your plan. 
It's reckless. 
I'm sorry, Chloe. 
You've never been my biggest fan. 
Why start now? 
Look, it's not as dangerous as they're saying. 
I've taken precautions. 
This can work. 
I just need ten minutes. 
If I can't get the systems online by then, fine, arrest me. 
When you brought me on for this job, you said it was because I didn't think like anyone else. 
Ever since I got here, I've been punished for that. 
I've been right more than once today. 
I think I've proven myself and I think I deserve that ten minutes. 
Ten minutes. 
Thank you, sir. 
You can't be serious about this. 
You need any help? 
No, just let me work. 
All right, let's give the lady some space. 
That's all, gentlemen. 
You are making a huge mistake. 
Maybe, but I'm willing to take that chance. 
O'Brian proved herself today. 
I want to see what she comes up with. 
I'd appreciate it if you and your men would stand by. 
Yes? 
What is it? Sir, there's a man 
here who wants to speak with you-- Bill Prady. 
He says he's a probation officer. 
Probation officer? 
From Arkansas, sir. 
What does he want? 
He didn't say. 
Put him in Holding 2. 
Tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes. 
All right. 
Dana, stay here in case O'Brian needs anything. 
I'll be in my office. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. Hastings, are you there? 
We're here, Chloe. 
What's your status? 
I'm into the trunk line. 
I'm about to activate the bypass circuit. 
Okay, what can we expect? 
Well, if I don't electrocute myself, some of our primary systems should start booting up. 
All right, whenever you're ready. 
We've got power to comm. 
And one of the sat links is back online. 
All right, that's good enough. 
Start looking for Bauer. 
Okay, Chloe, it's working. 
You all right? 
I just need a few more minutes. 
I'll be right there. 
Okay. 
Mr. Hastings, one more thing. 
If you do locate Jack, you need to call Renee Walker. 
Walker? 
She went out looking for him. 
She should be in the vicinity. 
Will do. 
Why don't you go see if Miss O'Brian needs a hand? 
And be civil this time. 
Come on, Owen. 
Stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
He's gone. 
I lost two of the snipers. 
If we're gonna make a move, we got to do it soon, Jack. 
We can't lay down cover fire for something we can't see. 
We need to give them something to shoot at. 
I'll make a break to the north, try and draw their fire, you make a run for the call box. 
But that's a suicide play, Jack. 
You'll never make it. 
But you will. 
No. 
I can't let you do that. 
I'm in command here. 
That's what gonna happen. 
Do you understand? 
Yeah. 
I need you to do me a favor. 
What is it? 
You make sure that Hastings keeps his promise. 
That he doesn't bring Renee back in. 
I give you my word. 
You're not gonna have long before they start firing on you. 
Good luck, Jack. 
You make it to that call box. 
Clear! 
Jack? Jack?! 
Jack? 
(gasps) It's okay. 
It's okay. It's me. 
It's Renee. 
It's okay. 
(groans) It's okay. 
Shh. 
(panting) They got the fuel rods in a boat. 
They're heading across the river into the city. 
I can't breathe. 
Shh. 
It's okay. 
Nothing went through. 
Relax. You may have 
a collapsed lung... 
Jack, I got through to CTU. 
They just got back online. 
NYPD's sending choppers. 
We still got a real good shot at finding them. 
Mr. Hastings, I just got 
a call from Agent Ortiz. 
The nuclear rods are on a Zodiac with two of the terrorists aboard. 
They were heading northwest across the river toward the city. 
Where are the choppers? 
One second. 
They just arrived at the port. 
Okay, redirect them. 
Start diverting all available NYPD units to that shoreline. 
We need to lay down a cordon. 
Yes, sir. 
Chloe? 
Thanks. You-You were... 
I'm not good with praise. 
What do you think you're doing, going to my boss? 
My job. 
I've answered all your questions. 
Why won't you just leave? 
I can't do that. 
I know you were involved with that robbery, Ms. Walsh. 
What? 
I think you know exactly where Kevin is. 
I think you're protecting him. 
You are out of your mind. 
And you're a liar. 
I'm not leaving here until I know the truth. 
This'll go a lot smoother for you if you just come clean right now. 
It's not too late, Miss Walsh. 
But I promise you, if you don't, I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall. 
Contact CTU. 
See if they picked 'em up going across the river. 
It's me. 
CTU's back online. 
I know. There are helicopters 
searching the river. 
They're getting close. 
You should have warned us earlier. 
I didn't have time. 
I was too busy preserving my cover. 
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stay under. 
I thought you took care of that problem. 
So did I. 
It came back. 
Well, we can't stay here. 
The police must already be cordoning off the area. 
We're going to need your help getting clear. 
I will get you out of there. 
Don't worry. 
Stand by. 
I'll call you in a few minutes.
