You killed Tariq? 
You can't let Father know. 
He wants me dead, because I messed up with Debbie. 
You were determined to kill him, to kill our own son. 
Nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done not him, not you. 
Your father's following us. 
What? 
It was the only way I could save you. 
( gunshot ) Oh, God! Oh, God! 
I think I got it. 
This is really it. 
I can turn off the override and stop the remaining plants from melting down. 
Did the best I could, sir. 
I hope it works. 
So do I. 
Edgar, what's going on? 
Why are some of the reactors still not shutting down? 
Six of the reactors were immune to the kill sequence. 
Contact Bauer. Either he 
finds the people responsible for planning the override, or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust. 
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago. 
Where'd they go? 
Falstead Security. 
You're going to need to set things up on your end. 
When Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked their location. 
Divert suspicion. 
Fine. 
The override device maintains heat levels within the reactor. 
They can melt down every one of those power plants. 
The man you saw when you were being held captive, right now he's our only lead. 
Stop there. 
I think that's him. 
They're trying to seal us off. 
Well, shouldn't we call CTU? 
No. CTU's gotta 
be compromised. 
That's the only way they'd know we were here. 
Then who are you calling? 
The only person I can trust right now. 
I'm empty. 
( screams ) Jack. 
JACK: Tony! 
Is there any chance this is a mistake? 
For the remaining six nuclear reactors, Arch is taking longer to shut down. 
No. I can recheck it. 
Those plants are firmly in the grip of the override, which has been sealed off. 
We can't get at it. 
Did you send a list of the six affected cities to the President? Yes, sir. 
What about evacuation procedures? 
We've already alerted the National Guard. 
We're just waiting to see how the President wants us to proceed. 
Miss Driscoll, President's ready. 
Okay, put him on. 
Mr. President. 
I understand we've been able to shut down 98 nuclear power plants. 
Yes, sir, but as of now, it appears that our shutdown order will not be effective with the six remaining reactors. 
Not going to be effective? 
What exactly does that mean? 
I'm afraid it means that we could have six nuclear disasters on our hands. 
What are the casualty projections if all six plants... 
melt down? 
450,000 deaths in the first 24 hours. 
The long-range estimate's in the low millions, and that's not taking into account the resulting cancers and birth defects. 
Why were we able to shut down the other power plants, but not these six? 
It's because they're still being controlled by the terrorists, sir. 
You mean because of the override device that they stole today? 
Exactly. 
We have to find the override device itself. 
It's a prototype, and the terrorists have the only one in the world. 
All right, then let's find it. 
I'm going to order the evacuation of those six cities. 
Jim, keep me posted. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
( phone ringing ) All right, let's get back to work. 
Yeah. 
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack. 
Don't let anyone know you're talking to me. 
We got a problem. 
I understand, Marcy. 
Let me see what I can do. 
I have to take this call. 
Yes, sir. 
What's going on? 
First off, sir, I want you to know that Audrey and I are safe, but there was an attempt made on our life at Falstead Security. 
What? 
A group of assassins, well armed, well trained, took out our entire security detail. 
You're gonna need to send a forensic unit over to identify the bodies, but I don't want anyone at CTU to know. 
Why not? 
Because I think someone over at CTU is complicit in the attack. 
How do you know that? 
Sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where we were. 
No one else had that information. 
Is one of Erin's people working with the terrorists? 
Yes, I think so. 
I just don't know who, but it's clear that they didn't want Audrey to make the I.D. 
of the man she saw when you guys were both being held. 
I'm sending a Secret Service detail to pick you two up. 
Sir, please don't do that. 
That's not the right thing to do here. 
Why not? 
I don't want anyone to know where we are. 
That way, I know we'll be safe. 
How do you want me to handle this? 
Remember the sequence we developed for the Melbourne situation? 
Yes. 
Try that. I think it'll work. 
Okay. 
Sir, I've got to go. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I know we're safe. 
Jack, take care of Audrey. 
Yes, sir, I will. 
You okay? 
I'm almost getting used to this. 
Yeah. 
Tony, is it possible that we could have been followed? 
No. We're clear. 
Where are we going? 
We need to lay low for a while. 
What kind of communication do you need? 
A wi-fi and a hard line. 
All right, we'll go back to my place. 
Okay. 
Thank you, Tony. 
Wait till you see it before you thank me. 
No, I mean for picking us up, saving our lives. 
I'm sure you're wondering what's going on. 
Not really, no. 
Something wrong? 
What could be wrong? 
I'm not in the federal prison anymore, thanks to you and President Palmer. 
Michelle left me. 
I... 
( sighs ) You know what? Never mind. 
Why don't you tell me what this is all about? 
You heard about Audrey and her father this morning. 
Yeah. 
We were at Falstead Security so Audrey could make an I.D. 
of a man she saw during the kidnapping. 
I don't get it. Why? 
The secretary's kidnapping was just a cover. 
The terrorists' main objective is to gain control of American power plants from coast to coast. 
The man that Audrey saw is our only lead. 
I thought you weren't in the field anymore, Jack. 
I'm not. 
The secretary is my responsibility. 
I got caught up in it. 
Yeah, well, listen to me very carefully. 
I don't want to get caught up in it. 
So you do whatever you need to do at my place. 
I'm staying out of it, all right? 
Understood. 
Today continues to be a challenge to the strength of the American spirit. 
We have a condition in six cities across the United States in which nuclear power facilities may become unstable. 
While we work to regain control over these facilities, I am also asking our National Guard to assist local authorities to affect an immediate evacuation of those six cities. 
This evacuation is only being issued for all persons living or working... 
The President didn't mention the fact that there isn't enough time left for a complete evacuation. 
If those reactors melt down, there are gonna be at least 50,000 dead per city. 
We still have time to try and find a way to prevent that. 
I can tell you now, Erin, the chances of doing that from here are very low. 
We have to find the people who have the override device. 
What about the hospitals north of there? 
All right. Keep checking. 
Called Dina's sister. 
There's no answer. 
All right, I'll take care of it. 
You and Rafi go check the station again. 
Okay. 
The Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors. 
How many are under our control? 
Six. 
More than enough to break their will, but I'm gonna have to manage the override personally, make sure those six melt down on schedule. 
Is there anything I can do? 
Yes. 
Take care of your mess. 
Don't worry, Madwan. 
I give you my word. 
My wife and son will be dead by the end of this day. 
( groaning ) We have to get you to a hospital. 
No. Your father knows 
I've been shot. 
He'll be looking for us in all the hospitals. 
Well, we're going to have to take a chance. 
Mom, you're hurt. 
I'll be okay. 
You won't. 
You need to get to a doctor. 
I'm not afraid of Father. 
You should be. 
He tried to kill me, and then he did this to you. 
He is not my father anymore. 
( groaning ) Mom, please. 
All right. 
Drop me off at an emergency room, but then you have to drive away. 
No. Whatever happens, 
we're staying together. 
Jackie, I'm running a filter for Driscoll. 
Could you baby-sit it for a sec? 
I'll be right back. 
Sure. 
Yes, Marianne. 
I couldn't take your call. 
I was in a meeting. 
Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are still alive. 
My information was accurate. 
Yes. The location was correct, 
but they survived the attack. 
Are they headed back to CTU? 
I haven't heard anything. 
Bauer didn't call in? 
Not that I'm aware of. 
That doesn't make sense. 
( sighs ) Actually, it makes perfect sense. 
Bauer knows there's been a security breach, and you can bet he's told someone here. 
I gotta get out. 
No, you are to stay in until we take care of Bauer and the woman. 
What about me? I 
am not gonna spend the rest of my life in jail. 
You'll be taken care of. 
You know that. Now go. 
There you are. 
What do you need? 
Division is waiting for those projections. 
Well, they're ready to be sent. 
Well, then, send them. 
( knocking ) Yeah. 
Sir, your assistant, Scott Borman, just arrived. 
Should I sent him in? Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Mr. Secretary, it's good to see 
you safe and sound, sir. 
Thanks, Scott. Sit down. 
Is there a problem, sir? 
There's a big problem. 
Someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside. 
What do you need me to do? 
I need you to go to Erin Driscoll. 
Tell her that Jack Bauer is no longer at Falstead Security, that he's watching the surveillance videos at an old CTU substation in Torrance. 
Anything about when Jack will call in? 
When they identify the man that Audrey saw. 
I take it Jack and Audrey are nowhere near the CTU substation. 
Right. I'm trying 
to flush out the mole. 
Then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat envelope around this place. 
And if anyone sends out a communication containing the information you planted, that's the spy. 
Yes, sir. 
Let's go. 
Let's go. 
Watch your step. 
The dog next door likes our yard. 
( rooster crows in distance ) Well, here we are, home sweet home. 
Just stay here. 
Oh, God! 
Who the hell are you?! 
Hey, Jack, it's okay. 
This is my friend Jen. 
Tell him to play with his guns outside. 
I'm sorry. 
Excuse me. 
I'm sorry. 
What are you doing here, anyways? 
I thought you were working. 
I'm going in late. 
This is Jack and his friend Audrey. 
This is Jen. 
Hi. 
I-I saw you on TV today. 
You're the daughter of the Secretary of Defense. 
You and your old man were kidnapped this morning. 
Yeah. 
What's going on? 
I'm helping them out with something. 
Could you be a little more specific? 
We need to use Tony's computer. 
What, they don't have computers where you work? 
Listen, babe, we have a situation here, all right? 
They need to lie low for a little bit. 
We can't let anybody know they're here, all right? 
Whatever. 
I'm leaving anyway. 
Tony... 
Jen, you can't go anywhere. 
Why not? 
We can't leave until Jack and Audrey take off. 
We can't take a chance. 
What kind of chance? 
I work at a bar. 
I'm sorry, Jen. 
We're not gonna be long. 
Look, stay as long as you want. 
I have a job. 
He doesn't. 
Jen, can I talk to you for a second? 
Please? 
Sorry. 
No, she seems real sweet. 
Look, we were fighting for our lives a few minutes ago, and if it hadn't been for Tony, we would have been dead. 
Now, I've been through a lot today, and I'm sure when this is all over, your boss will understand. 
And if he doesn't? 
I can have him killed. 
Knock yourself out. 
Thank you. 
How are you guys making out with that? 
Good. I just have convert this 
so I can read it. 
And then, hopefully, you can make an I.D. 
from the surveillance video. 
I have some software for that. 
Let me dig it out. 
Thanks. 
( quietly ): You told me about Tony, but I didn't know that Michelle left him. 
Yeah, a few months after he got out of prison. 
I thought he went to prison because of her. 
He saved her life, and she paid him back by leaving him? 
That's the way Tony sees it, too. 
Didn't happen exactly like that. 
When Tony got out of prison, he was angry. 
He couldn't get a job. 
Personally, I don't think he wanted one. 
He started drinking. 
He pushed her away. 
What is she doing now? 
Deputy director over at Division. 
I hope he can help us. 
If he can, he will. 
All right, here we go. 
You got it, Tony? 
Yeah, I got it right here. 
Thanks. 
We're in. 
Start the ball rolling with Driscoll? 
Yep. Headed into 
her briefing now. 
She's not gonna be happy when she finds out we're using her to flush out the mole. 
I am surprised you felt the need to keep her in the dark about this one. 
As long as there's a leak in CTU, we keep everyone in the dark. 
Make sure that you're online and that your databases are unlocked. 
As soon as Jack sends in the image, I need you to be able to move as quickly as possible to make this I.D., okay? 
I don't understand why Jack's doing this at the old substation. 
Well, apparently there's technical reasons. 
I didn't speak with him directly. 
Who did? 
I did. 
He also asked that his whereabouts be kept strictly internal until he contacts us. 
All right, let's go. 
Old CTU substation in Torrance. 
I remember this lady. 
We saw him around here. 
There he is. 
You sure that's him? 
Yes. 
I'm gonna route this through the D.C. office. 
Tony, she's on the phone. 
We can't have her making calls. 
We need the phone. 
Go to hell. 
I can't go to work. 
I can't talk on the phone? 
Just give me the phone. 
Go to hell! 
Give me the damn phone! 
( thud ) ( screams ) ( typing, computer blipping ) Go ahead. 
Thanks. 
This is Marcie. 
Marcie, it's Jack. 
I'm sending you the image we need I.D.'d. 
We're ready to receive. 
Okay. 
You positive this came from her system? 
Yeah. 
The voices were digitized and scrambled, but we were able to clean it up enough to make out the words "CTU substation. " 
Where's security? 
They're on the way. 
Thanks, Scott. 
Yes, Mr. Secretary? 
Erin, I'm sorry to report there's been a breach in CTU. 
What? 
The information Scott gave you about Jack is false. 
What do you mean false? 
Jack and Audrey were ambushed at Falstead Security. 
They survived the attack, but it's clear that someone in this office gave them up. 
With all due respect, sir, you knew about this and you didn't tell me? 
Being left out of the loop is not something you should be concerned about. 
I assume you're telling me now because your sting operation yielded a result. 
Yes, it did. 
Read that. 
Where is she? 
She's being taken into custody. 
Join me. 
Miss Driscoll, what's going on? 
Go with these men. 
What for? 
You're under arrest, Gavin. 
DRISCOLL: You've been passing classified information. 
What? 
What are you talking about? 
Take her to Holding. 
Miss Driscoll, what are you doing? 
Miss Driscoll, I haven't done anything. 
Miss Driscoll, this is a mistake. 
What is happening? 
Can someone please tell me what is going on? 
I didn't do anything, please! 
Get back to work. 
I don't care how you divide up her files. 
I just want everything off her system and then sent to me. 
And enter new pass codes. 
We can't just do this on your authority. 
Edgar... 
it's okay. 
But he works for DOD, not CTU. 
Yeah, well, he's the one that found the mole, right? 
And Heller wants him to have joint authority. 
Finish up here and get back to station two. 
The program we set up for the reactor is almost finished compiling. 
Can I see this? 
Sure. 
What makes you so sure Sarah's the mole? 
She was sending out encoded information about Jack Bauer. 
I don't think she would compromise Bauer or the investigation. 
That's how she was able to fool everybody, Edgar. 
She's the last person you'd expect to do it. 
All right, just get me those files. 
It's right here. 
2:22 p. m. Message sent: 
"Old CTU substation in Torrance. " 
This doesn't seem weird to you that she would leave it on her system like this? 
She didn't just leave it; it was encrypted. 
Yeah, with a Bainbridge algorithm. 
Come on, it's so old school, it's like saying, "Please decode me. " 
Let's face it, Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. 
( sighs ) ( door opens ) Please, Miss Driscoll... 
I promise you, there's been some kind of mistake. 
How could there be a mistake? 
Your system was isolated the message was sent from it while you were there. 
Somebody set me up. 
That's the only explanation I can think of. 
Tell me how that's possible. 
Someone backed into my system through a subnet, planted something. 
That's the first thing we checked. 
None of them were compromised. 
Let's stop playing games. 
Thousands of people's lives are at stake! 
Where are the people who control the override? 
I don't know. 
That's what I was working on. 
Who did you send the message about Jack to? 
I didn't. 
Miss Driscoll... ( sighs ) 
I would never betray our country or endanger people's lives. 
You know that. 
Was it the same contact who coordinated the attempt on Jack and Audrey's life at Falstead Security? 
I don't know. It wasn't me. 
I learned my lesson today with Sherrick, and I am no longer going to err on the side of caution in these interrogations. 
Do you get my meaning? 
I don't know what to say. 
Eric, no. 
Please don't do this. 
Eric... Miss Driscoll... 
( zapping ) ( gasping ) Please stop. 
If you want it to stop, you tell me where the Dobson override is and who has it. 
( crying ): I swear, I don't know anything. 
Wait. 
( crying ) There's got to be an explanation for this. 
You got to give me some time to think. 
( zapping ) Talk to me, Sarah. 
Talk to me. 
Miss Driscoll... 
I'm not a spy. 
I'm not. 
Please believe me. 
Driscoll, please. 
I'm concerned. 
Do you think you can break her in time? 
I can break her in time, if she's guilty. 
According to Scott, there is no way that this could be a mistake. 
I agree it's hard evidence, but I've known Sarah for eight months, and she doesn't fit the profile. 
How do you want to handle it? 
I'll watch for a few more minutes, then I'll go back in. 
I'll brief Jack. 
( crying ): Eric, please... 
please. 
Eric! 
What are you doing? 
Just checking the surveillance from later that night to see who he's talking to. 
Did you find anything? 
No, not yet. 
Anybody want a beer? 
I could use one. 
( phone rings ) This is Bauer. 
HELLER: We found our mole. Who is it? 
Sarah Gavin, works in Comm. 
Is she working alone? 
As far as we know. 
Okay, I'll call Marcie, tell her the CTU channels are open. 
We'll start sharing data. 
How's Audrey doing? 
She's good, she's resting. 
Sir, I think now would be a good time to send someone to have her picked up. 
We're at 21408 Kipling, North Hollywood. 
What's there? 
A friend. 
I'll send the Secret Service. 
Thank you, sir. 
Your father's sending someone over to pick you up, take you back to CTU. 
( quietly ): Okay. 
Don't you think you've made me miss enough TV today, Jack? 
( sighs ) Why didn't you ever call me? 
( scoffs softly ) For what? 
I've been there. 
I could help. 
( laughs ) I'm considered a traitor to this country. 
My wife left me. 
So how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack? 
Yeah. 
( sighs ) Look... 
I owed you for getting me out of prison. 
But today, I repaid that debt. 
And to tell you the truth, all you do is remind me of a past I'm trying to forget. 
So why don't you do me a favor. 
Do what you need to do here, and let's leave it at that, All right? 
Yep. 
So, how did this happen? 
I was working in the yard and... backed into a nail 
that sticks out of our gate. 
( groans ): Oh. 
This looks like a gunshot wound. 
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor. 
It was my fault. 
I was supposed to fix that gate last week. 
All right, you're gonna need a tetanus shot, then I'll stitch it up. 
Thank you, Doctor. 
I'll be right back. 
Go watch him. 
DINA: What's going on? 
He said something to the nurse. 
Did he make a phone call? 
Not that I could see. 
Did she? 
No. 
Good. 
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they called the police. 
At least the police could protect us from Father. 
It would be bad to go to jail for the rest of our lives. 
That's what would happen. 
So where are we going to go after we leave here? 
If we can get out of the city and stay somewhere for a couple of days, I can arrange for us to get out of the country. 
( sighs ) ( crying softly ) ( phone rings ) Yeah? 
Jack, it's Marcie. 
We got a match. 
Who is it? 
Name is Henry Powell. 
I posted everything on that secure site. 
Hold on a second. 
( typing ) Okay, I got it. 
He's a computer consultant. 
He used to work for McLennen-Forster. 
Wait a second, McLennen-Forster. 
They're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants. 
Yeah, well, he's not there anymore, but he freelances for them, and he's definitely still in L.A. 
How do you know that? Because 
he's trying to leave the city. 
We just found out he scheduled a chopper to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes. 
I thought all air traffic had been grounded. 
It is. He must have 
some well-connected friends. 
He got a special clearance. 
Son of a bitch. 
Where in Van Nuys? 
The helipad at the Larchmont Building. Okay, I'm gonna 
want you to ground his flight but not until I get there. 
I don't want him to see me coming. 
Jack, they're here. 
Can you make it in time? 
I'm gonna try. 
Audrey, get your things. 
We got to go. 
Agent Davis, Secret Service. Jack Bauer. 
You're gonna take the secretary's daughter straight back to CTU. 
Those are our orders. 
Okay. 
You got a car for me? 
It's right over there. 
Thank you. 
Audrey, they're ready. 
This is Agent Davis. He's 
gonna take care of you. Okay. 
Be careful. 
I will. You, too. 
CTU, Patterson. 
This is Jack. 
Let me speak to Erin Driscoll. 
Jack, I just got the file on Henry Powell. 
I'm going through it now. 
He's trying to leave the city. 
I've got to get over to Van Nuys. 
You want air backup? 
No, I want to keep a low profile. 
I don't want to spook him. 
The soonest I can get you a ground package is 30 minutes. 
That's gonna be too long. 
When is his flight due to take off? 
Less than 15 minutes. 
What do you want to do, Jack? 
He's most likely on his own. 
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself. 
All right. 
I'll send a team anyway. 
I'll be in touch. 
What are you gonna try and handle by yourself? 
Don't worry about it. 
It's covered. 
Jack, it'd be pretty stupid of me to let you die right after I risked my life trying to save you. 
Could you use my help? 
Yeah. 
All right, let's go. 
Curtis. 
Yeah, Edgar? 
Has Sarah confessed to anything yet? No. 
What are they doing to her? 
Don't worry about it. 
Just get back to work, all right? 
Curtis? 
What did Edgar want? 
Why do you care? 
Well, you should let him know we need his full attention Get back to your station. 
What's that? 
Just something to numb the arm so that I can close the wound. 
Okay. 
I really wish you'd let me admit you. 
This wound is serious. 
There's a chance of an infection here. 
No, Doctor, please. 
Do whatever you can, and we'll leave. 
Behrooz, where are you going? 
I'll be right back, Mom. 
WOMAN ( over P.A. ): 
Dr. Travis, 
you have a visitor in the main lobby. 
Dr. Travis... 
Mom, the police are here. 
Did you call the police? 
This is a gunshot wound. 
I told you it wasn't. 
DOCTOR: Then why are you acting so strangely? 
Let's go. 
You shouldn't leave you need to be treated. 
Wait! 
Let's go! 
Come on... 
Come on! 
( tires screech ) Marianne. 
( sighs ) What is it, Edgar? 
About an hour ago, you asked me to bump up your security clearance. 
I was a little busy with the override, but I finally got it for you. 
Great. Thank you. 
What? 
You'll need to pick a password. 
I set up the screen on server five. 
( sighs ) There you go. 
You need to use the same password as the one that unlocks your system files. 
Okay. 
Edgar. 
Why do you keep looking at me? 
I don't keep looking at you. 
Let's go outside. 
I want to talk to you in private. 
I don't want to talk to you in private. 
I have a lot of work to do. 
It is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar, to have to remind you repeatedly that I could step into Driscoll's office any moment and have you fired. 
Curtis, I need to talk to you. 
What is it? 
I need you to walk with me to Driscoll's office. 
Walk with you? 
Please, Curtis. 
Sorry to interrupt. 
What is it? 
You got the wrong person. 
Sarah's not guilty of anything. 
How do you know? 
Because I just sneaked into Marianne's system. 
She used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU, made it look like Sarah was the one.
