24 SO4E18  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: Mars Translator: sHiN3 Requiem Supervisor: rustyapple sHiN3 Previously On 24 This is air force one declaring an emergency. 
We're not gonna make it. 
I have to put it down now. 
Chloe, what's happening? 
Chloe! 
Air force one is down. 
This may be him. 
It's the president. 
He's still alive. 
I repeat, the president is alive. 
Marwan has to be within a 50-mile radius... 
Jack. 
There's a higher priority than finding Marwan. 
What is it? 
Recovering the nuclear football. 
Didn't it go down with air force one? 
The missile inflicted enough damage that the plane left a trail of debris as it went down. 
A lot of things were sucked out, including the football. 
That case contains the codes and locations of our entire nuclear arsenal. 
What's the location of the football? 
40 miles northeast of here in the middle of the desert. 
Air support! 
Football is in the lead jeep headed north. 
Take it out! 
I'm in possession of the football. 
Three hostiles are down, one escaped. 
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan. 
There's some pages missing. 
Tell me what the contents are of the missing pages. 
Jack, it's the red section which contains warhead locations and activation codes. 
If they get ahold of a warhead and a matching activation code, we will not be able to stop them. 
Mr. vice president... 
President Keeler is alive. 
But he's in critical condition. 
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th amendment and take control of things as soon as possible. 
You're worried about him? 
I am. 
He seems unsure of himself. 
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the united states, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the united states. 
Mr. President, I have just 
received a phone call from CTU. 
Part of the nuclear football has fallen into the hands of terrorists. 
The following takes place between 12:00 A.M. and 1:00 A.M. 
Vice president Logan has been sworn into office. 
He's now president of the united states. 
His office called, they want an update from us in 15 minutes. 
We're working on several protocols related to the plane crash. 
What is he going to want to focus on? 
He's going to want to know how a stealth fighter was stolen from one of our air bases and, more to the point, how it was able to take down air force one with one of our own missiles. 
Has he been briefed on Marwan? 
He knows Marwan is the mastermind behind today's events, yes. 
But he's going to want more specifics on the football. 
Where are we on that? 
Jack's at the debris field outside of indio. 
He's trying to reconstruct the red chapter of the playbook that was stolen by Marwan. 
How's he doing that? 
He's working with fred laughton from the department of defense. 
He wrote the codes, so he'll know what's missing. 
Good. 
Who's going to run point on this update? 
You and Tony. 
All right, everyone, we don't have a lot of time, so we're going to have to fast-track this. 
Double source all intel through homeland security and CIA. 
Skip the usual request procedures, tie into their data directly. 
yes? 
Ms. Dessler, I've got 
Jack Bauer on the line. 
Put him through. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
Michelle, are you still in briefing? 
Yes, Jack, you're on speaker. 
What have you found? 
Fred Laughton and I just finished a rough reconstruction of the red chapter- we're getting that over to you now. 
Jack, it's Bill Buchanan. 
Summarize our exposure. 
What information exactly does Marwan now have in his possession? 
Well, the red chapter lays out the location of our domestic nuclear arsenal. 
The inventory is in the thousands. 
Many of the weapons are in transit as part of our standard shift operations. 
Why can't DOD just secure these weapons? 
Because a number of the weapons are in between checkpoints. 
It would take over an hour to account for all of them. 
Listen, everyone, we've got to remember, Marwan only needs one. 
All right, Jack, we'll get on this immediately. 
Get back here as soon as you can and help Audrey liaison with dod. 
We need to account for every single weapon documented in that chapter. 
I'm on my way. 
The coordinates for the third one are latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes. 
Longitude 115 degrees, 21 minutes. 
There it is. 
Jefferson city, Iowa. 
When is the warhead due to arrive? 
7:00 A.M., Local time. 
Five hours from now. 
That puts it somewhere 200 miles east. 
It's still in illinois. 
We can intercept it anywhere from this point to here. 
All right. 
Let's put our people in place. 
The warheads that are in transit because of the daily shift-and-hide operations pose the biggest problem. 
We can verify military traffic in the coastal areas from here. 
Why don't we find out what DOD has in the midwest. 
Yeah, that's already underway. 
Audrey said she should have it in a few minutes. 
Look, Tony... 
am I interrupting something? 
No, Chloe. 
What is it? 
Are you logged on to division three? 
Yeah. 
Look at this: 15 minutes ago, the credit card of Eric Murphy was used at the western gas station in torrance. 
Who's eric murphy? 
His real name is yosik khatami. 
He's a terrorist affiliated with Marwan. 
How do we know that? 
Through a watch list. 
We put out a net asking for anybody connected to the name Habib Marwan. 
We didn't expect to get any hits so soon. 
Why was he so careless? 
Maybe he wasn'T. 
Maybe it's some sort of decoy. 
Well, it wouldn't be much of a decoy because we don't know where he is or what direction they're traveling in. 
This was a mistake. 
Did the gas station have a surveillance camera? 
Yes. 
He's driving a black lexus 300. 
Are we hooked into satellite? 
Yes, we're monitoring them now. 
If this guy's still on the road, we'll find him. 
Who do we have in the area to run point? 
Curtis just left division. 
He's heading over here right now. 
Divert him to western gas station. 
Have field ops meet him there. 
All right. 
This is audrey. 
Hey, it's me. 
Hey. 
Are you on your way back here? 
Yeah. 
How much of the weaponry has been accounted for so far? 
72 percent. 
We're having problems getting confirmations from the midwest. 
Why? 
There are several convoys shipping weapons to be dismantled in accordance with the arms reduction treaty. 
A lot of them were re-routed after the train bombing this morning. 
Just use local channels. 
All weapon transports have to check in with regional substations. 
Just call them directly. 
All right, I'll do that. 
How you holding up? 
I'm okay. 
What have the doctors told you about paul? 
They're having a hard time keeping him stable. 
You just hang in there. 
He'll fight through it. 
Yeah. 
Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes. 
All right, will do. 
Bye. 
yes. 
Marwan, it's me. 
Is everything all right? 
No. 
No, it's not. 
I made a stupid mistake. 
They're going to find me. 
What happened? 
I stopped to get gas. 
While I was driving away, I realized I used the wrong credit card, the one with the name Eric Murphy, the one you gave me. 
I told you to get rid of that one. 
I was in a hurry, Habib. 
I had to make the arrangements for the delivery of the warhead. 
When that transaction gets flagged, they'll be searching the highways. 
I know, that's why I'm not on the highway anymore. 
Where are you? 
Inglewood. 
I'm on my way to Prado's now. 
You're closer to the marina. 
Go straight there. 
I'll have him meet you. 
Prado can make arrangements to get you out of the country. 
Thank you, Habib. 
Thank you. 
Mr. President, it may be 
precipitous moving to the bunker now. 
Working from the oval office might exhibit a greater sense of confidence in our abilities to handle this crisis. 
The purpose of the bunker is to protect the president in times of crises, is it not? 
Yes, sir. 
now I feel it's always wiser to take the prudent course. 
Will I be able to function at 100 percent down here, mike? 
Absolutely, mr. President. 
What kind of protection does this bunker afford? 
Total. 
You're 200 feet below the surface. 
If the white house suffers a direct hit, everyone in the bunker would be safe, as would the communication infrastructure to the rest of the country. 
Let's hope that's not needed. 
Mr. President... 
Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line. 
Hello, Bill. 
What do you have for me? 
Mr. President, I'm here with 
Michelle dessler, director of CTU Los Angeles and Tony Almeida, heading up tactical. 
Good. 
Let's get started. 
Have all of our armaments referenced in the red chapter been secured? 
Not completely, mr. President, 
but we're working with DOD on that. 
What else do we know? 
The man who has choreographed today's events, Habib Marwan, is still at large. 
Most likely he is in possession of the red chapter. 
What are we doing to find him? 
We just picked up a thread, sir. 
We have a location where one of Marwan's associates was detected 20 minutes ago. 
That sounds promising. 
What else? 
We're sifting through all of our intel now. 
We're hoping to put together a pursuit scenario soon. 
So you're pretty confident you'll be able to catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan, before he strikes again? 
It's not an exact science, sir. 
All we can do is maximize the probability for success. 
There are no guarantees. 
Of course. 
I understand that. 
We need to get control of the situation. 
I can't run the government from down here indefinitely, but I'm not going upstairs until it's safe. 
Sir... 
I think their time is better spent working up what they have. 
I recommend we let them get back to it. 
Okay, bill... 
call us when you have something more concrete. 
Yes, sir, I will. 
All right, let's get back to it. 
Wait a second. 
Does anybody else feel uneasy about what we just heard here? 
In what way? 
Logan's supposed to the man who speaks to the people of this country and exudes confidence. 
Not fear. 
Air force one was just attacked, president Keeler is in critical conditional. 
Logan was just sworn in, give him time. 
We don't have time. 
We've got Yosik Khatami. 
A traffic cam picked him up, heading towards the coast. 
We have him on satellite. 
Link this up to Curtis, I want him running point on this takedown. 
Tell Curtis to remain discreet. 
I want to know what Khatami's doing, who he's meeting, before we take him down. 
Michelle... 
I was out of line before, about you and Bill. 
It's your life, and I've got no right to judge you. 
I appreciate that. 
And whatever tension there is between us, I want to apologize for my part in it. 
I'd like it if we could just let it go, so we could do our jobs. 
Leave the past in the past and move on. 
Sounds good. 
all right Curtis just called in. 
He's about to arrive at the marina and set up. 
Good, set up a satellite, also patch in an audio link. 
I'll take care of it now. 
Thanks, Edgar. 
You want me to run point on that? 
No, bill and I will do that, but I want you in on this. 
To do what? 
I'd like your tactical input. 
Fine, uh, I'll have Edgar transfer everything over to the situation room. 
I get the feeling Tony's not entirely comfortable with the configuration here today. 
We haven't seen each other for a very long time. 
It's uncomfortable for both of us. 
The difference is, you seem to be able to stay on point. 
I'm not so sure about him. 
I am He'll be fine. 
He's alone. 
What's he doing? 
It looks like a meet. 
He's waiting for someone. 
Is the marine unit in place? 
Yeah, behind the jetty. 
Looks like the man Yosik's meeting just arrived, he's walking towards him. 
Is it Marwan? 
I can't tell. 
Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive. 
All right, copy. 
All right, all teams, I'll close off the foot of the pier. 
Keep them contained, but do not shoot to kill. 
Repeat, do not shoot to kill. 
Damn it. 
Teams respond. 
Who is that? 
This is macallan at point three. 
It looks like a private patrol. 
All right, hold your positions. 
Yosik.. 
Brother. 
You're late. 
I've been standing here waiting for you. 
Well, I'm here now. 
Let's go. 
Come on. 
What are you waiting for? 
Wait. 
What's the matter? 
Someone's here. 
This is Miller. Blue base is clear. 
It's okay. 
It's just marina security. 
No, something's wrong. 
They're onto us. 
Yosik, now. 
The man he's meeting is not Marwan. 
Is there anybody else there besides the two of them? 
Not unless there's someone else on the boat. 
All right, marine units, move into position. 
All teams, move in. 
We're okay. 
I think we should just get out of here. 
There was a police officer out there. 
I told you, that's harbor security. 
They stop by all the time. 
Damn it. 
Who the hell's that? 
This is CTU. 
We have you completely surrounded. 
Yes? 
They found us! 
Where are you? 
It doesn't matter. 
It's over- they're going to get us. 
Yosik, you can't let that happen. 
You cannot allow yourself to be captured. 
I understand. 
Also, you have to kill Prado. 
He knows too much. 
I'll do what's necessary. 
Yosik? 
Yosik? 
Come out with your hands up! 
You're completely surrounded. 
There's no escape. 
Drop the gun! 
Put the gun down! 
Step off the boat. 
Get off the boat. 
There's a man inside. 
I shot him- he was gonna kill me. 
He was trying to steal my boat. 
It was self-defense. 
Put your hands on your head. 
Who are you? 
Who are you? 
My name's Joe prado I'm innocent. 
I have nothing to hide. 
Where's Yosik? 
He's dead. 
This phone was lying next to him. 
Get him out of here. 
let's go Secure the boat. 
Yosik's dead. 
We have the man he was meeting. 
He says his name is Joe Prado. 
Bring him in. 
We also recovered Yosik's cell phone. 
We'll try and pull something off it. 
I'll report to you en route. 
Good work, Curtis. 
We're standing by. 
What do you want to do? 
Control the situation. 
Make sure Prado doesn't talk to the authorities. 
He can hurt us. 
How do we get to him? 
We can'T. 
Not directly. 
Hello? 
This is Marwan. 
Yes, Marwan? 
Can you reach amnesty global at this hour? 
For what? 
An attorney. 
I'm sure I can. 
Tell them that an innocent man is being held without charges and is about to be tortured at CTU Los Angeles. 
By god's grace, President Keeler survived, but more than 75 others did not. 
I share in your grief and anger from this tragedy. 
My family and I feel no differently than each and every one of you. 
We are shocked, saddened and maybe a little afraid. 
These terrorists have displayed, once again, their indifference toward human life. 
They will pay for what they have done, I assure you. 
Bill, excuse me. 
There's a convoy missing. 
What? 
It was headed from Illinois to Jefferson city, Iowa- it disappeared just inside the border. 
Disappeared? 
They were due to call in at their checkpoint every 20 minutes, they didn'T. 
I tried to reach them on comsat. 
There was no reply. 
What about satellite? 
Nothing showing up. 
What was on the trucks? 
A nuclear warhead. 
Our faith and our resolve will prevail. 
Okay, we've got the fingerprints. 
I'll run them through our databases. 
thanks What do we know about the prisoner Curtis is bringing in? 
Just the name he gave: Joe prado. 
Curtis just uploaded his picture and prints. 
I'm running them through now. 
Prep holding so curtis can begin interrogation as soon as they arrive. 
I want this man broken in minutes, not hours. 
Clear all directories, put all resources into finding this warhead. 
Believe me, Mike, I wish I had known about this sooner, too. 
Look, I'm not pointing fingers here. 
I'm on your side, but the president is not going to be happy that the statement he made could be invalidated. 
I don't know what to tell you. 
We're putting everything we've got into finding this missing warhead. 
All right, we'll get back to you. 
Move! 
Inside! 
Let's go! 
Move, move, move! 
We've got it and we're heading out now. 
General Thomas just told me we're missing a nuclear warhead. 
Yes, I just heard some of the details from Bill Buchanan. 
When did this happen? 
It disappeared somewhere between 1:45 A.M. 
And 2:15 central time. 
None of our satellites was able to pick this up? 
It was in mountain terrain at night. 
Our people are analyzing the imagery now, but it's going to be hard to find. 
What are we going to do if we don't find this man Marwan? 
Our people are doing everything they can to contain him to the Los Angeles area. 
It's going to be difficult for him to leave. 
Yeah, well, it's difficult to shoot down air force one with our own stealth fighters, but he managed to do that. 
Who knows what else they're planning? 
I'm sure he's going to come after me next. 
Mr. President, there's no 
indication that that's his plan. 
You don't know that! 
I don't know that! 
We don't have enough information to know what his plan is! 
The head of Secret service is on his way over now. 
He has a revised plan that I'm certain will ease your mind about your safety. 
That's the bastard curtis found at the marina. 
The one that's helping the terrorists. 
I guess. 
I'd like to get him in a room for a few minutes. 
What? 
He'd talk to me in about ten seconds. 
Oh, you want to hurt him to get revenge for your mother dying. 
I can understand that. 
Take him to holding. 
Did Edgar run the prints I sent? 
Yeah. The name checks out. 
Joseph prado, ex-marine. 
No criminal record, but over the last five years, he's got no record of employment, either. 
Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary. 
That's right. 
I'll find out if he knows anything about the missing warhead. 
All right. 
Tony What do you got? 
I found the convoy I've just got off the Iowa highway patrol Millitary transfer was ambushed Everyone's dead what about the warhead? 
Gone Alright,find out what kind of vechile being used to transport also tell the local law-enforcement to put up premiters I want you to check for any airstrip server remotely clearence they might be able to put down a chopper Yeah Remember he's ex-marine He won't cave easily I just need to establish that even we're in the government building I'm gonna go as far as it takes How are you gonna start? 
i will use Richard OK I've told you i'm not talking to you,pal I haven't been doing anything wrong I killed that man,it was a self-defence,he was trying to steal my boat. 
We both know it's a lie So let's not wasting our time,what do you say,John? 
I'm not saying anyting to you. 
Now,you're lying to me What the hell is this? 
Yes Michelle,where's curtis? 
He's just about start with pardo Tell him to stop. 
What? 
That's an order, both of you, come to the floor, now. 
 It was a self-defence - Curtis  You can't do this to me  Curtis What? 
Bill wants to see us before we start Wait till I get back What's this about? 
I don't know We have a problem with that This is david winston from amnesty globe And I have a signed court order here protecting the rights of joesff Prado who knew have been in custody You see US maschalls are here to assure that i'm taking to the prisoner immediately That's ridiculous That's your opinion But Mr. Prado's rights will not be violated 
Take me to him now We are not assured Curtis Do as he says There is a nuclear warhead missing This is our only lead Bill I'll get into this with the Justice Department. 
In the meantime do what he says When can i expect his call? 
It's extremely important Yes,i understand that but i need to talk to the judge immediately please have him called me back Mr. Buchanan 
Do you have those hourlies for me? 
No, i don't but i'm here on another matter you what? 
I heard the interrogation on prado have been put on hold that's right why you have a job to do,please get back to work I know i'm not supposed to be interfering in the matters of policy but considering what i have been through today my mother dying because of these terrorists i want to know why you let some slamy lawyer protect the dirty-bag like prado we don't happy that either,but we're gonna fix it but it's gonna take some time that's time we don't have Edgar stop i'm trying to cut you some slack here but you need to get back to your job you need to put all that stuff aside and hold for awhile yes,sir yeah, Cannon yes i'll hold for the judge what was that all about?you're 
supposed to be doing the hourlies. 
I know i don't want anybody keeps telling me what i'm supposed to be doing i have a photographic memory in case you forgot How can i forgot,you tell me like every other of the day i don't know why what's happened here we have some pc lawyer holding us up from doing our job your job is do the hourlies you're holding yourself up chole Have you heard of the mising warhead. 
yeah, FBI link up with our department yet? 
yes.i'm sharing both of databases 
OK. Good. who's questioning the prisoner 
You mean Joseph Prado that Curtis broght in yeah no one what are you talking about? the 
attorney came in from antis globe with a court order saying he won't allow to being-alone with Prado The attorney came in from amnesty globe with a court order saying we won't be allowed to being-alone with Prado Buchanan is on the phone with judge sending the order now I'll be right back. 
I don't believe this I disagree with you,you honor, this does not fall outside the boundary of patriot yeah,alright thanks what the hell is going on here you got the key witness on the missing warhead We should be pressing this guy with everything we've got Judge's known more If you want to appeal we should wait until 7 A.M. take him to the pillar judge 
does he know what the stakes are? 
he does,but he's feeling Prado got no record he shouldn't be treated like a terrorist What about the fact that he was caught meeting with known terrorist in the middle of the night on appear? 
Circumstantial we need to interrgoate this prisioner, I don't care what kind of court order we even get I agree but the attorney is with him U.S. Marshal's protecing his right. 
Where's attorney? 
In holding with Prado Jack, don't make it worse. 
I just want to talk to him. 
How much longer do I have to stay here? 
I'm trying to get you out as soon as I can. 
My office is in the process of filing a complaint. 
They have nothing on me. 
I was standing alone on my boat. 
I don't even know the man'd going after. 
Come in with me, Al. 
Who are you? 
My name is Jack Bauer, Department of Defense, and you are? 
David Weiss, amnesty global. 
Curtis, why is the suspect not in his restraints? 
Amnesty global's order supersedes our authority. 
Mr. Bauer, my client is cooperating. 
He's not trying to go anywhere. 
All he wants is to be treated like any other U.S. Citizen. 
Your client aided and abetted people who attacked the president of the united states today. 
You don't know that. 
As a matter of fact, we do. 
Then charge him. 
May I speak with you privately? 
Get the door. 
You and I both know that your client isn't clean and that he conspired to steal a U.S. Nuclear warhead. 
All my client wants is due process. 
Mr. Weiss 
these people are not gonna stop attacking us today until millions and millions of americans are dead. 
Now, I don't want to bypass the constitution, but these are extraordinary circumstances. 
The constitution was born out of extraordinary circumstances, Mr. Bauer. 
This plays out by the book, not in a backroom with a rubber hose. 
I hope you can live with that. 
Sir, can I help you? 
No, it's all right. 
How did you get here so fast? 
What?! 
Who asked you to represent Mr. Prado? 
I don't have to give you that information. 
Curtis, from the time of his arrest, did the suspect have time to call a lawyer? 
No. 
Marwan called amnesty global. 
This is his play. 
That means prado definitely knows something Marwan doesn't want us to hear. 
We still can't get around that court order. 
We need to call the president now. 
We cannot have any leaks regarding this missing warhead. 
I've contacted General Wilson in Iowa. 
He's sealing off the roads while we clean up the ambushed convoy. 
What about those highway patrol officers who discovered it? 
Wilson's already brought them in and is explaining the situation. 
The good news is, this is happening in the middle of the night. 
Most of the country's still asleep. 
yes. 
CTU Los Angeles is on the line for president Logan. 
They say it's urgent. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
That'll be all. 
Walt. 
Stay. 
Put 'em through. 
Go ahead, please. 
Mr. President, this is Bill Buchanan. 
I'm here with Jack Bauer. 
Yes, bill. 
What do you have for me? 
Sir, in the process of trying to track down this missing warhead, we brought a prime suspect in for questioning. 
What have you learned? 
Well, that's the problem, sir. 
Right now, our hands are tied. 
Amnesty global has interceded on his behalf. 
Interceded on what grounds? 
He's a U.S. Citizen with no previous record. 
Why is he a suspect? 
We found him with Yosik Khatami, the man who's linked to today's terrorist events. 
I don't understand. 
It doesn't violate any law to question a suspect. 
Mr. President, if I may...? 
Go ahead, Mike. 
Jack, it's Mike Novick. 
Hi, Mike. 
Am I correct in assuming that this suspect is unlikely to respond to the kind of q&a his lawyer would permit? 
That's correct, mike. 
If we want to procure any information from this suspect, we're gonna have to do it behind closed doors. 
You're talking about torturing this man? 
I'm talking about doing what is necessary to stop this warhead from being used against us. 
Give us a moment, Bill. 
Mike, what do you think? 
I think we need to do whatever it takes to find Marwan. 
Walt? 
Weigh in. 
Well, this makes me nervous. 
Why? 
Should this man be innocent, as he claims he is, your first act as president is to sanction his torture. 
Well, that'll... 
that'll forever haunt your presidency. 
All right, gentlemen. 
Here's what I'll agree to. 
I'll call a special session with members of the justice department and we'll discuss this. 
I'll have an answer for you in 20 minutes. 
Mr. President, this thing 
could be over in 20 minutes. 
That's as far as I'm willing to go right now. 
With all due respect, sir, please let us do our jobs. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
I'll have curtis start the interrogation of prado. 
You and I both know we can't afford to be wasting time like this. 
You heard the president. 
He's not going to let us touch this guy. 
The president's not here- you are. 
If I authorize this, they'll know in ten minutes. 
We'll all be out the door. 
What if I can find another way to handle this that wouldn't implicate anyone else but me? 
I'm not going to authorize that, Jack. 
You don't have to. 
What do you mean? 
Accept my resignation. 
And if I do that, what then? 
Release the suspect. 
Release him? 
We don't question him, don't charge him, we just let him go. 
He won't need a lawyer, or a marshal. 
You're going to take him on as a private citizen. 
yes? 
how far away are you? 
92 miles. 
When you get there, you'll meet with Morris. 
Is he the one who's going to configure the detonation? 
Yes. 
I've given him the codes. 
Okay. 
You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir. 
We cannot give the americans time to start an evacuation. 
Yes, Marwan. I understand. 
No delays. 
It'd be done. 
Hey, when did you get back? 
A few minutes ago. 
Thanks. 
Good. 
I could use your help on the DOD interface. 
I can't help you right now, Audrey. Sorry. 
What are you doing? 
I'll tell you when I get back. 
Jack... 
Jack! 
Audrey, please. 
What the hell are you trying to pull here? 
First you want to torture me, and now you're throwing me out? 
That's right. 
It's okay, Joe. 
I'm sure they tried to fight the restraining order, then realized they couldn'T. 
No, that's not what this is. 
They're doing something. 
Don't be so paranoid. 
We're just not interested in you anymore. 
I want protection when I get out of here. 
The marshal can escort back wherever you want to go. 
No, no, no! 
You know what? 
Change of plan! 
I don't want to leave here until I know I'm safe for the next few days. 
If you don't leave, I'm going to have to arrest you for trespassing in a secured government building. 
Once that happens, not even your attorney can protect you. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, David. 
He's right. 
What's going on? 
Where are they taking Prado? 
He's been released. 
Why? 
I don't know. 
It came from Buchanan. 
Mr. Buchanan, why are you letting him go? 
Edgar, not now, please. 
But he's working with the people that killed my mother. 
Not now. 
Cheer up, Joe, you're a free man. 
Yeah, free. 
The marshal's going to take you home. 
No. 
You kidding me? I can't go home. 
I've got to go somewhere public, like a hotel. 
Fine. 
Tell him where you want to go. 
Don't let anyone know you're there. 
Here's my card. 
You call me if anyone from CTU tries to bother you. 
Yeah, okay. 
You're going to be fine. 
make a sound, and I will blow your brains out, all over the windshield. 
Handcuff your left arm to the dashboard, now. 
now we're going to talk. 
now... 
you and I both know your heart isn't in this. 
You just wanted the money. 
I don't want you. 
All I want is Marwan. 
I don't know any Marwan. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Yeah, well, I'm running out of time here, so why don't we just cut to the chase. 
where's Marwan? 
I don't know! 
Where is Marwan?! 
Where is Marwan?! 
I don't know! 
I swear I don't! 
Okay, okay, okay, Marwan'S... 
Marwan's going to be at a place called the hub club tonight. 
Where is it? 
It's just... 
it's just east... 
where is it?! 
It's just east of downtown! 
Just east of downtown.
