Why? 
Because I don't want to kill innocent people? 
Because you're weak and you stand for nothing! 
Is there a problem, Navi? 
Government agents have arrested Dina and surrounded the building that I'm in. 
How much more time do you need to melt down the remaining nuclear power plants? 
One hour, maybe two. 
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will. 
I have a suspect in custody. 
I need assistance. 
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son back to CTU and head up the interrogation. 
Wait a second, Jack. 
They're not going to let me set foot in CTU, even if I wanted to. 
If I press hard enough I can get you reinstated, but I need to know now: Is that what you want? 
Ms. Driscoll, I'm sure you're 
aware of my history here. 
Not an issue. 
Jack Bauer and secretary Heller both vouch for you. 
That's enough for me. 
Did Powell worked directly for the terrorists? 
I told you, I don't know. 
I need names, people who can get us to the override. 
This place may not be as empty as it seems. 
What, you think this is some kind of trap? 
Yes. 
I do. 
I didn't give him anything. 
I... 
What does CTU know about the override? 
Audrey, it's me. 
Hey, did you find anything at the address? 
Yeah, the company that owns the building, it's called galaxy financial services. 
Have you ever heard of them? 
No, should I have? 
Your husband's the chief financial officer. 
What are you doing here? 
What's really going on? 
Are you spying on me? 
Are you doing something worth spying on? 
What is that supposed to mean?! 
Take your hands off of her! 
You set me up! 
Put your hands on your head now! 
What do you want? 
I want some answers. 
The following takes place between 5:00 p. m. and 6:00 p. m. 
I think it would be better if you left the room while I question your husband. 
You can wait just outside with the backup team. 
What are you going to do to him? 
Whatever I have to. 
I'm staying. 
Fine. 
Look at me, Paul. 
Look at me! 
I've got nothing to say to you. 
This is what you need to know, Paul. 
There are five nuclear power plants ready to melt down. 
All I care about right now is making sure that that doesn't happen. 
Your name is on a lease in a building in chatsworth that was used by the terrorists to plan today's attack. 
That makes you a prime suspect. 
I'm going to treat you like one. 
Do you understand that? 
My name is on at least 50 different leases. 
I own ten different corporations. 
I don't know anything about some building in chatsworth. 
I don't believe you. 
The lease of that building was notarized. 
There's documentation of your id. 
Ctu verified your signature. 
Paul, you need to start talking to me now. 
I've got nothing to say to you. 
Jack. 
I don't think that Paul would be a traitor to this country. 
Right now Paul is a prime suspect, and he's not cooperating with me and I don't have time to do this any other way. 
I need to know for sure. 
Paul... 
this is the last chance you've got to talk to me before I have to hurt you. 
Tell me about 24878 alvert street in chatsworth. 
Why's your name on the lease? 
Jack, please. 
Audrey, don't interfere! 
If you need to step outside of this room, do it. 
Why is your name on the lease? 
You're bluffing. 
I need that information, Paul, I need it now. 
Come on, Paul, just tell me. 
What's your connection to the terrorists? 
Jack? 
Please, don'T. 
All right, all right, all right. 
I-I-I don't know the specific building you're talking about. 
I can find out. 
How?! 
My corporate records are stored on my laptop. 
If that address is under my name then it'll come up. 
Maybe there's someone else involved I don't know about. 
What's your user id log-in number? 
It'll be much quicker if I just do it. 
Please. 
You want me to believe that you're not involved with this, Paul? 
You better show me who is. 
I'm sorry I had to call you here, Marwan, but I had no choice. 
Ctu is trying to disable the override, using a drinfeld module. 
They've already shut down over 90 reactors. 
We always knew they'd stop some of them. 
The important thing is that one of the reactors has melted down. 
As long as the override has control of the other five, I can do the rest from here. 
Everything is ready for you upstairs. 
Will anyone in that office be suspicious? 
I've reported a system failure. 
If anyone asks, tell them you're from it restoring my hard drive. 
My desk is in the last row, three from the end, seat 86. 
The override is well disguised inside the desk. 
Here is the key. 
Good. 
How much time will you need? 
45 minutes to melt down the remaining reactors. 
I'm here if you need anything. 
Where is the CTU agent? 
Forbes is questioning him now. 
He's out. 
He's not going to tell us anything. 
What does Marwan want us to do with him? 
Finish him off. 
Then get rid of the body. 
Take care of it. 
He came with a woman and two other agents. 
Where are their bodies? 
They're already in the van. 
Yeah, here it is. 
Galaxy financial services. 
What kind of a company is it? 
It's, um, a failing payroll service I was about to dissolve, and someone came in with an offer to buy 51% of the shares. 
Seven, 800 grand, something like that. 
Here- Harris Barnes, director. 
Who is Harris Barnes? 
I, uh... don't remember. 
What do you mean you don't remember? 
I'm involved with over 30 companies. 
I don't deal directly with most of them. 
Explain to me, Paul, how your name got on the lease. 
I don't know. 
You expect me to believe that you entered into a business deal worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with someone that you'd never met? 
Yes. My attorney handles most of the... 
Paul, I don't believe you! 
Jack, it's possible. 
Paul has put together a lot of deals through his attorneys. 
This is Sarah. 
Hey, it's me. 
I need you to run a name for me. 
Go ahead. 
Harris Barnes. 
He's the director of a cAlifornia corporation- galaxy financial services. 
What am I looking for? 
Where he lives, his businesses, anything that could possibly connect with any terrorist activity. 
All right, give me a minute. 
I'll be here. 
She's calling me right back. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, your boyfriend is just a thug with a badge. 
Paul, why is your name on that lease? 
Unbelievable. 
An hour ago, I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself that you didn't want me back. 
And now... you think I'm a terrorist? 
You think I had something to do with you and your father's kidnapping? 
I don't know what to believe anymore. 
Yeah? 
Okay, I ran down the name Harris Barnes, and a lot of data came up, but it was inconsistent. 
So I went into the irs records and found out that Harris Barnes didn't appear on their logs until two years ago. 
So it's an Alias. 
As far as I can tell it's a washed id, with a vAlid social security number and credit card history. 
Interpol back-traced a name and provided a list of foreign nationals who've used it in the past. 
Who used it most recently? 
A man named Habib Marwan. 
Okay, we need to find him. 
I think we already have. 
What do you mean? 
Marwan used the name Harris Barnes to lease more office space here in L.A. 
It turns out the same address was given to us an hour ago by Marianne Taylor. 
She and Curtis are there now. 
What's the address? 
It's the 29th floor at the Rockland building downtown. 
Okay, I'm on my way. 
As soon as Curtis calls, you patch him through to me. 
You got it. 
You think Marwan's there? 
Right now, it's our only lead. 
If he is, that's where the override is. 
I'll get back to you. 
I want you to tell me who's still out there. 
I want the name of anyone who can help us find that override to stop the plants from melting down. 
My husband kept all of this from me. 
I only helped. 
That's a bunch of crap. 
Now, we know you were just as involved as your husband. 
Listen, we're quite aware that the only reason you're helping us is because of your son. 
But believe me, it's not too late for us to change our minds about how we treat him. 
There are a few men whose names I heard Navi mention. 
They might know what you want. 
But I don't know how to find them. 
All right. 
Why don't you start by writing the names down? 
As far as we can tell, this Habib Marwan's been controlling the override. 
Jack's on his way there now? 
Yes. 
Curtis and his team are already at that building. 
I know, but we haven't been able to reach him or his team members. 
He's not answEring his cell. 
How far is Jack? 
About 15 minutes out. 
Keep trying Curtis. 
Tell him Jack's on the way. 
We have to coorDinate the two and find that override. 
Okay. 
Tony? 
Ask her about a man named Habib Marwan. 
Who's Habib Marwan? 
I heard Navi speak of him a few times. 
He's an engineer. 
Beyond that, I don't know. 
Miss Driscoll? 
Yes? 
This is Alison Lackey at the clinic. 
There's a problem with your daughter Maya. 
I think you should get down here as soon as you can. 
I'll be right there. 
Thank you. 
It's the CTU agent's phone. 
What should we do? 
Nothing. 
Let them wonder where he is. 
By the time they reAlize what's happened, it will be too late. 
Find out if Adam and Jason have disposed of the body. 
They should have been back by now. 
All right. 
Yeah? 
Ali, Adam and Jason are dead. 
Did the agent escape? 
No, the door's still armed. 
He's still on this floor. 
 Find him. 
 Yeah. 
Yes. 
The CTU agent is loose on this floor. 
How did he escape? 
He killed two of our men. 
Does he know the override is in the building? 
I don't think so, and he can't get to it. 
We have the exits covered. 
Disconnect all the hotlines. 
He can't be allowed to contact CTU. 
I will. 
No, no, no. 
You can't keep me here! 
Maya, please. 
We just want to help you feel better! 
I'll feel better when you get out of my face! 
Maya! 
What took you so long? 
I thought she was given a sedative. 
We did. 
She's fighting it. 
Give me a few minutes with her. 
Sure. 
Nurse. 
Honey. 
Honey... I brought you here 
so that you could be near me. 
Isn't that what you wanted? 
I want for us to go home. 
Maya, we will, honey, but we can't just yet, honey. 
I don't like these people here. 
Maya, Maya, that's not going to make you feel better. 
You're wrong. 
I do feel better. 
 Sweetheart, I need you to... 
 Go, get out! 
You're such an important person, why don't you take care of your important business? 
 Maya... 
 Doctor? 
Doctor?! 
Doctor? 
Yes, Maya? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
I was misbehaving. 
But I promise to be good. 
If you'll just get that out of here. 
I'm going. 
I'm going. 
Bye. 
I'll be in my office if you need me. 
Come on, Maya. 
Curtis's phone is ringing, and he's not answEring it? 
Right. 
It rang several times before I got his message. 
If he had turned it off, it would have gone to voice mail immediately. 
He's in trouble. 
Where are the field teams? 
Castle and his men will be there in two minutes. 
I can have them set up a staging area along the perimeter and stand by for your command. 
What's the probability that Marwan's even in the facility? 
We don't know yet. 
Where are they staging? 
They'll be waiting for you in a parking lot at the northwest corner of wilshire and grand, one block away. 
Okay. 
Have your people found Marwan yet? 
No. 
Audrey, you, you have to know that I would never be involved in anything that could bring you harm. 
Of all the people this Marwan could approach to do business and he chose you? 
It's a hell of a coincidence, Paul. 
It might not just be a coincidence. 
They might have wanted Paul for more than just the corporate shell. 
He chose Paul because he was my husband? 
That would put them one degree of separation from your father. 
So this Marwan used me to get to Audrey's father. 
It's a possibility. 
Well, I had no idea where Audrey or her father would be today. 
The information they used to stage the kidnapping couldn't have come from me. 
They would have used your relationship with her father for something else. 
Maybe to plan something for the future, a contingency plan. 
I've been careless. 
I'm so sorry. 
all right, well, so far every name Dina's given us has checked out as a mid-level cell member. 
But what's interesting is that Marwan, who she claims to have never met, is connected to everyone on this list. 
It looks like all roads lead to him. 
This must be his operation. 
Which means she definitely knows more than she's telling us. 
What do you want to do to make her talk? 
I just need you to give me a little bit of rope. 
Do it. 
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan? 
I already told you. 
No, you told me you never met him. 
I haven'T. 
Danny, could you come in here, please? 
I'm going to need all video and audio monitoring in this room disconnected. 
Thank you. 
I'm not a stupid woman. 
What are you trying to prove with this? 
I'm not trying to prove anything. 
I just don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded. 
I don't believe you. 
Open the door! 
Everybody out. 
Get out, now! 
Everyone, Erin. 
Unless you tell me the whole truth right now, that deal you made to save your son is over! 
And he goes to prison for murder and treason! 
You can't do that. 
The president signed an agreement. 
If that deal gets in the way of protecting this country, you think the president's gonna stand behind it? 
He's gonna tear it up, and your son goes to prison for the rest of his life. 
Let me tell you, I know a little something about prison. 
And based on the conditions of his confinement, I can tell you right now, I give behrooz about three months before he commits suicide. 
And by the way, I'm going to make it my personal mission to make sure you never hear word one about what happens to him, ever! 
Wait. 
Habib Marwan is the man our cell reported to in the united states. 
You said "your cell. " 
How many other cells reported to him? 
I don't know. 
But there are others? 
Yes. 
How many? 
I told you, I don't know. 
The cells are not in contact with one another. 
Marwan thought it was safer that way. 
What about the override? 
Is it in his possession right now? 
Definitely. 
Definitely? 
Why definitely? 
Your programmers are trying to interfere with the meltdown sequence. 
Marwan is the only one capable of stopping them. 
And he's trying to do this by controlling it directly? 
Exactly. 
Where? 
Where?! 
Somewhere in downtown. 
The rocklyn building? 
Yes. 
Sarah Gavin. 
Sarah, get me Jack Bauer on the phone. 
You got it. 
Place her back in holding. 
Erin, Dina just confirmed Marwan's got the override. 
He's at the rocklyn building. 
Everyone, listen up! 
The address where Curtis is and where Jack Bauer is heading, is the location of the override. 
I want every station to focus on this location. 
I want field teams ready. 
Rework your assault tactics on the building factoring in this new information. 
Let me speak to Tony. 
Hold on a second. 
Tony. 
I've got Jack. 
Jack. 
Yeah? 
We have confirmation: Habib Marwan is controlling the override. 
He's at the address you're headed to. 
What about Curtis? 
No, we haven't been able to reach him yet. 
Have you changed the assault profiles? 
We're working on it. 
Look, Marwan's the key to this. 
He can't know we're coming or he'll take off with the override. 
Also, we're running out of time. 
We've got about 20 minutes before these plants start to melt down. 
Okay, tell Castle to prep for a low-profile assault. 
Tell him I'm on my way. 
Copy that. 
Get me Castle. 
Ali? 
Go. 
Have you found him yet? 
Marwan, it was not necessary for you to come down. 
Not necessary? 
We will find him. 
If I'm captured, it'll end everything we've been working for. 
We control the floor. 
He can't get far. 
Don't tell me what he can't do. 
He's already killed two of our men. 
What is it, Forbes? 
Tell me you've got him. 
No, I'm sorry, Marwan. 
He may have gotten away. 
How is that possible? 
Ali says the floor is locked off. 
I know. 
We're still searching. 
But we've got to deal with ventilation, air ducts, ceiling space... 
I don't care how you get him, as long as he's contained. 
I need 30 minutes. 
Can you make that happen? 
I can make it happen. 
30 minutes. 
Who's Marwan? 
Who is he? 
Does he have the override? 
Does he have the override? 
Yes. 
Where is he? 
Where is he? 
One flight up. 
I don't have access to the floor. 
Ctu Sarah Gavin. 
Sarah, it's Curtis. 
Where's Driscoll? 
Where have you been? 
We've been trying to reach you. 
I'm still in the rocklyn building. 
Sarah, listen. 
Maryanne's dead, I'm sure our backup teams are dead, too. 
The override is here. 
Uh, Jack's on his way to you now. 
Jack? 
I need you to put together a security detail for Paul and Audrey Raines now. 
I'll take care of it. 
I want you to stay here with these men until I get back. 
Are you going in? 
Yeah. 
One second. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's manning. 
Where are you? 
I'm still in the building- 29th floor. 
Where are you? 
I'm in the staging area about a block away. 
Have you secured the override device? 
No, but it's here, on an upper floor. 
A man named Marwan is in control. 
I know, CTU worked up a partial profile. 
What's your mobility? 
Limited. 
They're still looking for me. 
But I took an access card off one of the hostiles. 
How do we meet? 
Take the main elevator. 
There's only one guard posted there. 
I'll take care of him. 
I'm on my way. 
We've got Marwan boxed in. 
I want you to send in your team, reinforce the perimeter. 
I want men on the first floor in case this thing goes hot. 
Got it. 
I'll be right back. 
Go, go! 
That was our field agents from the rocklyn building. 
Your daughter's with them now. 
She's safe. 
I don't want her anywhere near harm's way. 
She won't be, sir. 
I understand we're closing in on the override? 
We hope so, sir. 
We believe we've found where the terrorists have it. 
Which is where? 
In an office building in L.A. 
We believe the terrorists are either associated with one of the tenants, or they've created a corporation they're hiding behind. 
How is CTU proceeding? 
We have teams converging. 
Once we find the override, we have to use it to reprogram the reactors manually. 
Will there be enough time to reprogram? 
Our people will be ready, sir, once we find it. 
All right. 
I don't have to remind both of you of the consequences if we fail. 
Everyone here understands what's at stake, sir. 
Excuse Me, Miss Driscoll? 
Dr. Sanford's on line two. 
Excuse me, sir. 
I'll meet you on the floor. 
Yes, doctor? 
I'm sorry to bother you, but Maya's acting out again. 
What is she doing? 
She's being abusive to my staff. 
She's broken a few things. 
If she doesn't settle down, I'm going to have to move her to a private hospital. 
We're not equipped to handle a patient like Maya. 
All right, don't do anything. 
I'll be right there. 
Sarah? 
Excuse me. 
Is Edgar still online with NRC? 
Yes. 
They found any alternate ways to stop the meltdowns? 
Not without the override, no. 
What's happening at the rocklyn building? 
Castle just called in. 
His teams are spread out on the perimeter. 
What about Curtis? 
He's about to meet up with Jack inside the building. 
Okay, where are you monitoring? 
Station three. 
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. 
Make sure everything's ready and calm if Jack and Curtis get their hands on the override. 
OK. 
You're a cruel person. 
Do you know that? 
Maya, please. 
This is a restricted area. 
You have to stay in your bed. 
Stay in my bed? 
What am I, a baby? 
Maya! 
What do you want, mother? 
Don'T. 
Please, don't treat these people disrespectfully. 
Please don't tell me what to do! 
I'll stop telling you what to do when you stop behaving like a child. 
What? 
You heard me. 
There are other people in this world besides you and they have problems, too. 
Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself or am I going to have to call security and have them restrain you? 
You're pathetic, you know that? 
I will not allow you to talk to me like this. 
I will not! 
What are you going to do about it? 
I... 
I just want to get out of here, mommy. 
And I will take you home, but I have something I have to finish first. 
 No... 
 It's okay. 
Are we clear? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
That's my girl. 
We've got a man down. 
Take the wall. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I overheard a phone conversation between Marwan and one of his men. 
We have less than 15 minutes. 
How many are still Alive? 
I'm not sure. But at least four. 
Have your men secure the floor. 
Curtis and I are going after the override. 
Which way? 
This way. 
What about backup? 
No backup- we can't let Marwan know we're coming. 
What's upstairs? 
Ids data systems. 
My guess is Marwan somehow inserted a sleeper into the company. 
They must have used their servers to download the virus into the nuclear power plants. 
By piggybacking on ids hardware. 
Yeah. 
Take the door. 
All right. 
Clear. 
Step away from the door, ma'am. 
I need you to exit the building. 
It's an emergency. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Did you get a description on him? 
No. 
It could be anyone. 
Hey, bob, what's going on? 
Yes? 
Marwan, it's Ali. 
We've been discovered! 
Ali? 
Make sure all the exits are covered on all floors. 
Roger that. 
Last man down. 
Curtis! 
Stay down! 
Stay down! 
I got this exit! 
You got him? 
No! 
Jack, I have the override! 
Secure it! 
Call CTU now! 
Now! 
I got him! 
Driscoll. 
Erin, it's Curtis. 
I have the override. 
Put Edgar on. 
Edgar, line one. 
It's Curtis. 
He has the override. 
This is Edgar Stiles. 
Is the override logged in? 
Yes. 
Send it to channel 11. 
I can'T. 
What do you mean you can't? 
All the fields are write-protected. 
It's not supposed to be. 
If you're directly plugged into the override, you should be able to do anything you want. 
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's locked up. 
What do you want me to do? 
Miss Driscoll, the clinic just called. 
Tell them they're going to have to wait. 
 They said it was an... 
 Tell them! 
Edgar, we're out of time. 
If you're going to do something, do it now. 
Marwan was the engineer on the project. 
He must've modified the override to do this. 
The NRC screen is showing the meltdown stage is already beginning. 
Edgar, do something! 
Curtis, there must be a hot key. 
There's a lot of keys, Edgar. 
I can't just try random combinations. 
It'll take too long. 
Press the function keys one at a time. 
The status window on the bottom will light up when you get to an active one. 
F5. 
Good, hold it down and press "escape. " 
Nothing. 
Try F5, shift, Escape. 
Okay, it's responding. 
Good, set it to channel 11. 
Hurry up. 
Edgar, now they have three plants in meltdown initiation. 
Did you get it? 
I hope so. 
It's starting to respond. 
Yes! 
The temperature is dropping on all remaining power plants. 
Good work. 
Congratulations, Edgar! 
Great work, Erin. 
Thank you, sir. 
Excuse me. 
Maya? 
Where is she? 
Maya? 
Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh, baby... 
Oh... 
It's over, sir. 
We've stopped the meltdown. 
This is Bauer. 
We got a man down. 
Marwan is in the northwest stairwell headed to ground level. 
Does anybody read me? 
Jack, it's Castle. I'll get man up there. 
All CTU agents: Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer. 
I repeat, the suspect is impersonating a CTU officer. 
Solaris, do you read me? 
Solaris, do you read me?!
