24 SO4E21  Presents All Subtiles Are 4 Evaluation Use Only CC: Johnsonh Timeline: Mars Translator: sHiN3 Supervisor: Requiem Previously On 24 People of America: You wake up today to a different world. 
One of your own nuclear weapons has been used against you. 
"You wake up today to a different world. 
" Do we take that literally? 
That he'll set off the warhead before dawn? 
A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian secured a hard drive belonging to one of Marwan's associates. 
This hard drive may contain information that could lead us to the warhead. 
I will give you full authority to act as my proxy whenever you think it's necessary. 
Mr. Koo, there's a man in your 
consulate by the name of Lee Jong. 
We need to take Mr. Lee into 
custody immediately for questioning. 
But Mr. Lee is a Chinese citizen. 
I can't just hand him over to you without going through channels. 
Jack, is there any doubt in your mind that Lee is working with Marwan? 
No, sir the e-mails he sent left no room for doubt. 
Then we have to get Lee out now and find out what he knows. 
Yes, sir. 
No one connected with the government can admit to knowing anything about this... 
ever! 
Got him! 
Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van. 
Mr. President, the consul is dead. 
He was shot when armed men broke into this building and took Mr. 
Lee with them by force. 
Mr. Lee, tell me where Habib Marwan is. 
Damn it, we're losing him! 
Paul, what is it? 
I can drain off some of the fluid but we need to get him back into surgery now. 
Jack... 
Jack, what's going on? 
This man is our only connection to a stolen nuclear warhead. 
You've got to save him now. 
I already have a patient! 
You have a new one! 
If you don't save him, Billions of people will die. 
Jack... 
I have my orders. 
I'm doing my job. 
Paul's crashing. 
Jack, he's dead. 
Jack, you son of a bitch, you killed him. 
The following takes place between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. 
Gauze. 
Gauze. 
Is he going to make it? 
We're going to do the best we can. 
I just need him coherent long enough to get the information about Marwan and the missing warhead. 
I know, Jack. 
You already made me aware of that when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life. 
One milligram atropine! 
What is it? 
Jack, I don't have time right now. 
Jack, we need to leave. 
Let them do this. 
Gauze. 
I'll be right outside. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry. 
How could you? 
How could you kill him, Jack? 
How could you do it? 
No... 
No... 
no... I can't... 
I can't... 
be there right now. 
Please, Audrey... 
just tell me what you want me to do. 
Leave. 
I want you to leave, Jack. 
Jack, you need to call the white house right away. 
Mike Novick needs to speak with you. 
It's urgent. 
Okay, fine. 
What? 
Paul Raines just died. 
There was only one doctor and I had to make a choice between Lee's life and Paul'S. 
A-and I chose Lee. 
You did the right thing, Jack. 
You okay? 
No, I'm not okay. 
I'm sorry. 
Just tell me when Lee's out of surgery. 
I will. 
Mike Novick's office. 
This is Jack Bauer for Mike Novick. 
Please hold. 
Hello, Jack. 
Have you gotten anything useful out of Lee yet? 
No, he's still in surgery. 
How's that coming along? 
Not great, but he's hanging in there. 
I don't have to tell you we took a huge risk getting this guy, under the assumption that he can help us find the nuclear warhead. 
Trust me, Mike, I know. 
We also have a new situation. 
What is it? 
When you broke into the Chinese consulate, Koo Yin, the consul, was shot. 
That's not possible. 
My men never fired their weapons. 
Then he was accidentally hit by one of his own people. 
How badly was he hurt? 
He died, Jack. 
Oh, my god... 
I want you to talk to the members of your team. 
Make sure that each one of them has an alibi for where they were during the ambush. 
Okay. 
This is an extremely incendiary situation. 
I'm about to talk to President Palmer now. 
We're trying to avoid a serious confrontation with China. 
We'll handle it from here. 
Thanks, Mike. 
How did this happen? 
Mr. Buchanan, the network 
security module lit up. 
Someone on the outside is trying to jam our satellite servers. 
Could this just be a high network load? 
No, it's definitely a denial of service attempt. 
What do you want me to do? 
Do any damage yet? 
No, the Cisco system is self-defending. 
All right, have one of your people use the security auditor tool. 
Maybe it'll lead us to Marwan's network. 
That was my point from the start. 
Chloe. 
We're in an active code. 
We don't have time for your personality disorder. 
Do you understand me? 
Chloe? 
Yes or no? 
Yes, sir. 
This is Yasir. 
Is the warhead in place? 
Yes, but we have a problem. 
I can't jam their satellite. 
You assured me that you could handle it. 
CTU must have just installed new software. 
This wasn't in place last week. 
We're going to have to move our schedule forward by an hour. 
There won't be as many casualties if people aren't at work. 
If you can't jam the satellite signal, they'll find us. 
We can't let that happen. 
I understand. 
How long are we going to keep the President in the dark? 
Eventually he's going to find out that you authorized a raid on the Chinese consulate. 
We have to keep it from him as long as we can. 
Were you able to find Jack? 
Yes. He's back at CTU. 
The man they grabbed at the consulate, Lee Jong, is still in surgery. 
Was he able to tell us anything about the warhead? 
No. 
What did Jack have to say about the Chinese consul's death? 
It wasn't our people who fired the shot. 
The Chinese won't care. 
He died as a result of our trespass. 
We have to start constructing a scenario that doesn't implicate the united states government. 
They must know we did this. 
We called the consulate about Lee Jong half an hour before the abduction. 
The Chinese don't want a confrontation any more than we do. 
If we can create a scenario of plausible deniability, they may play along. 
How do we do that? 
Call CTU. 
Have them find out which anti-Chinese factions have attacked their embassies or consulates in the last five years. 
Most of these groups you're talking about are asian extremists. 
I'm sure Bauer's team was predominately americans. 
Bauer's team was masked. 
No one saw their faces. 
They were all masked? 
Yes. 
Wait. 
His mask was lifted. 
Use the image processing filters. 
OK Let me see. 
Send this image to Beijing and Shanghai. 
Have them cross-reference it with our intelligence databases. 
Find out who this man is. 
I will. 
Curtis, come here. 
Listen up. 
The Chinese consul was shot and killed during Lee's extraction. 
How? 
We never got a shot off. 
I know, I know. 
It must have been friendly fire. 
But look, we've got to make sure all our alibis cross check. 
No one outside of this operation is to know that we were anywhere near the Chinese consulate tonight. 
Understood? 
Jack, what's gonna happen? 
Are we going to be brought into this? 
I don't know yet. 
All I do know is now that the consul's been killed, everything has changed. 
It's our responsibility to make sure that the united states government is never implicated in this operation. 
Don't worry, Jack. 
Everyone here gets it. 
Okay. 
Curtis, you advise the rest of the team. 
You got it. 
Yasir. 
They're ready for you to make the changes. 
Do you think they'll find it before we launch? 
Not if I move up the launch time. 
They're looking for the warhead in their cities. 
They have no idea that it's going to be delivered by missile. 
Morrison? 
Yes, sir. 
Open up the guidance firmware. 
I'm going to upload a new instruction set. 
Yes, sir. 
Okay, go ahead. 
All right, you'll be ready to start the launch sequence as soon as we've reprogrammed the onboard. 
Good. 
Jack, prep all your databases. 
When Lee comes to, we're gonna have to move quickly. 
What about the warhead? 
We're meeting on it now. 
Chloe, I need you to free up a server for a large D.O.D.Block transfer 
it'll be coming through a locked channel from Heller's office. 
Has that been authorized? 
No, not yet, I still have to talk to Audrey. 
That's gonna be weird. 
What? 
Talking to Audrey, I mean, you had to do what you did and her husband died. 
It's probably destroyed your relationship with her. 
Chloe, please, just free up the server. 
Okay. 
Jack, I just want you to know that if you need anyone to talk to as a friend, I'm here for you. 
Not now, but later, when things calm down. 
Thanks. 
Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you. 
I need you to call Marcy, authorize a block transfer. 
We need all pertinent D.O.D. 
Databases sent over here to CTU. 
Were you able to keep Lee alive? 
Yeah, he's stabilized. 
All right. 
I'll call Marcy. 
Thank you. 
Now the warhead was stolen here, in eastern Iowa. 
We don't yet know how it's being transported Are we monitoring air traffic? 
Yes- so far nothing's been picked up. 
Well, if they have to stay on the ground, how far could they have gone? 
Based on our latest information, 300-mile radius, which includes three metropolitan areas. 
Have those cities been alerted? 
The President wants to keep that information restricted for the time being. 
We have raised local alert levels, but haven't mentioned specifics. 
Marwan and his people have control of the nuclear warhead. 
We have to figure out when and where he's going to set it off. 
I want you looking at everything from satellite to local police. 
We have a small window. 
It's still the middle of the night. 
If Marwan leaves a trail, it's going to be a hell of a lot easier to follow it now than in two hours when people start going to work. 
Let's get to it. 
We think this is the man you asked us to find. 
But you're not sure. 
There was a good match on a lot of the available characteristics. 
Howard Bern. 
Member of a tactical unit for CTU Los Angeles What are you going to do? 
Talk to him. 
How? CTU won't let you anywhere near him. 
They'll have to. It would 
be a diplomatic mistake for them not to cooperate under the circumstance. 
Get me the head of CTU Los Angeles. 
There's a program at division you can filter those markers through. 
It'll tell you which ones are good. 
Yeah? 
I've got a Mr. Cheng from the Chinese 
consulate who wants to speak to Michelle. 
This is Michelle Dessler. 
Ms. Dessler, my name is Cheng Zhi, head 
of security for the Chinese consulate. 
I'm sure your office is aware of the incident that happened here earlier tonight. 
Yes, we were very sorry to hear about it. 
Is there anything we can do to help? 
I would like to come over and discuss this matter with you. 
Of course. 
My office would be more than glad to make an appointment with you in the morning. 
No, I need to do that right now. 
I'm afraid that's impossible. 
You must know we're in the middle of a national security crisis. 
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese soil could be construed as an act of war. 
What does that have to do with us? 
I believe your agency stormed the consulate and kidnapped Lee Jong. 
That is an outrageous accusation. 
Just an hour earlier, your government called and asked for permission to speak to Lee Jong. 
30 minutes later we were attacked. 
It is unlikely these two events are unrelated. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng, I can't help you. 
I suggest you cooperate voluntarily. 
Otherwise, I'll be forced to go above you on this. 
I'm sure you'll do what you have to. 
I mean no disrespect, but I do have to get back to work. 
Very well, Ms. Dessler. 
You'll be hearing from me soon. 
Get me Secretary of State Taylor Tell him it's an urgent matter. 
Comm just confirmed that we got the data from Marcy, thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Yeah. 
Audrey, you should get some rest. 
With everything that's going on, I can't. 
You could go back to the hotel. 
Jack, please don't tell me what to do. 
What? 
Jack, what do you want from me? 
You made a choice that killed Paul, and I'm trying to deal with it. 
We both have a job, let's just do it. 
Jack. 
Michelle says the head of security at the Chinese consulate just called. 
What? 
He made it sound like he has evidence linking CTU to the abduction of Lee. 
What kind of evidence? 
He didn't say, but he wants to come down here and talk to us. 
They don't have any evidence, they're bluffing. 
Bill, we don't have time to deal with them right now. 
I agree, but we don't have much choice. 
I need you to help me figure out how to deal with this, Jack. 
I need to check on Lee's condition first. 
I'll get back to you. 
All right CTU just sent this over. 
These five groups have all made attempts to attack or sabotage Chinese targets around the globe in the last two years. 
This group here... 
people's freedom coalition? 
They've actually made speeches where they referenced Lee Jong's involvement with the Chinese nuclear program. 
So an attack on the consulate and the grab of Lee Jong by this group would be plausible. 
It would allow the Chinese to save face. 
And if the Chinese can't provide proof that we entered the consulate, saving face may be all they need. 
If you want, I can start leaking it to the media. 
Do it. 
Mr. President. 
David, what have you done? 
Excuse me, sir? 
I just got a call from the secretary of state telling me about a covert action against the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. 
That's correct. 
I sanctioned it. 
Why would you have done such a thing? 
It was the only option at the time. 
Don't you know how fragile our relationship with China is right now? 
You authorized an attack on their consulate! 
That's a military engagement. 
It was a covert operation, not dissimilar to those carried out by countries on a routine basis around the world. 
Don't give me a social studies lesson, David. 
We marched onto Chinese soil, we kidnapped one of their nationals and in the process the Chinese consul was killed. 
We were unlucky, sir. 
Unlucky? 
Yeah, I would say that we were unlucky. 
That's the kind of thing that could start a war now how am I supposed to be able to fight terrorists while I'm provoking a nuclear superpower? 
I would advise you to calm down, sir, if we're going to get through this day. 
We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves, but we're going to be the ones to settle it. 
This is a dirty business, and we're gonna have to get our hands dirty to clean it up. 
Now, please, Mr. President, 
you brought me here to help you. 
Let me do it. 
Tony, what's the latest on Lee? 
He's out of surgery. 
Dr. Besson thinks he'll be able 
to respond to questions soon. 
All right, when that happens, I want everyone from comm on standby. 
Whatever information Lee gives us on the warhead I want worked up without any time lags. 
We're clear about this, correct? 
Yes, sir. 
good That was secretary of state Taylor. 
He just authorized the head of security at the Chinese consulate to come here and question us about the raid. 
What? 
In the middle of all this? 
All right. 
This breaks down very simply. 
They want to prove that we attacked the consulate tonight. 
We have to make sure they can't do that. 
Well, that ambush has got to land on someone. 
Mike Novick's working on that from Washington. 
We just have to make sure all our bases are covered here. 
Finding that nuclear warhead is our number one priority. 
I'm going to go over the strategy with Jack. 
When Cheng gets here, send him to the situation room, make sure all our visible screens are masked. 
Okay. 
This situation with the consulate is dragging us down. 
We shouldn't be diverting resources away from finding that warhead. 
Hopefully this will just be a formality and we can get rid of him quickly. 
If we don't get information from Lee, Audrey's husband will have died for no reason. 
What is she still doing here? 
I think she wants to stay busy so she doesn't have to think about it. 
It's funny, when I met Audrey this afternoon, it seemed like she and Jack were totally together. 
A few hours later, everything's changed. 
Michelle... 
I hate being without you. 
I never wanted it to be this way. 
Cheng's here. 
Send him to the situation room. 
Buchanan and Jack are waiting there for him. 
Shouldn't we keep him more isolated than that? 
No. 
We have to give the impression we have nothing to hide. 
All right. 
Mr. Cheng. 
Yes. 
I'm Curtis Manning. 
Hello, Mr. Manning. 
Our regional director is waiting for us in the situation room. 
If you'll follow me... 
good. 
Mr. Cheng. 
Bill Buchanan. 
Pleasure to meet you in person. 
My condolences for the loss of your consul. 
Thank you. 
This is Jack Bauer from the department of defense, he's working for us today. 
Mr. Cheng, please take a seat. 
I know of Mr. Bauer, of course, from 
his previous service to this country. 
We knew you were in Los Angeles today. 
When did you arrive? 
Flew in from Washington a couple of days ago with Secretary Heller. 
I assume, then, secretary Heller is still here. 
No. 
For security reasons, he's at our district office. 
Why aren't you with him? 
We felt, under the circumstances today, I could be more helpful here at CTU with Bill. 
That's odd. 
Not really. 
As you know, I used to run this office. 
So if there's anyone capable of leading a covert operation under short notice, you would be the ideal candidate. 
Mr. Cheng, this kind of unfounded... 
That's all right, Bill, I've got it. 
Mr. Cheng, I can assure you that 
neither CTU nor i had anything to do with the terrible events that took place at your consulate tonight. 
I assume you know this man- Howard Bern. 
One of your field agents. 
This was taken by one of our surveillance cameras tonight. 
This photograph has been altered. 
Just to make it clearer. 
Or to set up a scenario that you can utilize for political propaganda. 
No, Mr. Bauer. 
We ran this image through our database. 
The computer picked Mr. 
Bern as a near perfect match. 
Did you take the time to cross-reference your database to include members of the people's freedom coalition? 
Because according to our information, they're the group most likely behind this attack. 
That would be pointless, wouldn't it? 
This man is not asian. 
Mr. Cheng, 
you and I both know that the PFC has initiated terrorist activity around the globe utilizing european mercenaries, half a dozen of which are a closer match to this photograph than agent Bern. 
I take it, then, Mr. Bern 
is not available to question? 
No, he's not here tonight. 
Of course. 
Mr. Cheng, you must know 
that it would not be in America's best interest to provoke the Chinese government. 
Then what are we playing these games for? 
30 minutes before we were attacked, you asked our consul to give up Lee Jong. 
Before our government can comply, the consulate was attacked, Lee Jong disappeared. 
Now you tell me you don't have Lee Jong. 
Howard Bern is not available to be questioned. 
What are you trying to hide? 
We're not trying to hide anything, sir. 
We're just extremely busy. 
Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
This is Bauer. 
We are faced with unprecedented terrorist attacks on american soil. 
All of our resources and attention are focused on trying to stop those attacks. 
Thank you. 
We have confirmation on Marwan's last location. 
Follow up on that. 
I'll handle the rest of Mr. Cheng's questions. 
I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr. Bauer. 
I'll see what I can do. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Have Bern meet me in the east corridor. 
Get a chopper ready now. 
I will. 
Meet Jack in the east corridor now. 
Dispatch. 
This is Chloe O'Brian Jack Bauer's requesting a helicopter standing by for immediate departure. 
Okay, done. 
Thank you. 
Come on, follow me. 
What's going on? 
A security camera at the Chinese consulate picked up your face. 
That's impossible. 
I was wearing my mask. 
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame. 
It was you. 
Jack, the guy ripped the mask from my face for one second. 
I pulled it right back down. 
I can't believe a camera picked that up. 
I had no idea. 
You're going to have to leave the city. 
We're working out a scenario. 
In a couple days, you're going to have to answer questions from the Chinese. 
I didn't think anyone saw me. 
That's why I didn't bring it up earlier. 
Don't worry, we're gonna handle it. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
You got to go. 
There's a chopper waiting for you. 
This is Bauer.. 
Jack, Lee Jong's coming out of anesthesia. 
He should be ready for questioning now. 
Agent Rabb's already there. 
I'm on my way. 
Are you ready? 
All my databases are active. 
Okay, good. 
Doctor, that's enough. 
He's mine now. 
Thank you. 
Tell him he's in critical condition, he still needs medical attention I'm going to ask him a few questions. 
When he answers them, I'll let the doctor continue to treat him. 
He understands. 
Tell him I know that he worked with Marwan on the warhead. 
Now he needs to tell us where it is. 
He doesn't know. 
But he knows where Marwan might be. 
What do you mean, where he might be? 
In the van he told me he knew where he was. 
Because of what he's doing, Marwan's been moving around. 
Where? 
There are three locations he knows of that Marwan's using today. 
What are they? 
The Rocklyn building... 
we know about that one. 
A bar downtown. 
We know about that one, too. 
A factory on sixth. 
Where on sixth? 
Alameda... 
sixth and alameda. 
Give me an exact address. 
That's the one we're looking for. 
I need you to assemble a team, make sure Curtis is on it. 
They need to be ready to move now. 
Yeah. 
Audrey. 
Yes? 
The investigator from the Chinese consulate wants to talk to you. 
Why does he want to talk to me? 
In order to protect Jack's cover, we put together some new hourlies for him to look at They show you and Jack working together at the time of the ambush. 
Buchanan wants me to lie to the Chinese to protect Jack? 
Not to protect Jack- to protect the united states government. 
Is that gonna be a problem? 
Where are the hourlies? 
Edgar's sending them to your system. 
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, Curtis. 
I understand. 
Well, whatever you decide, you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng. 
What's happening? 
Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan. 
We're getting ready to move on it now. 
I'm being called in for questioning. 
By who? 
Cheng, from the Chinese consulate. 
Come here. 
Why you? 
Buchanan modified the hourlies so that it'd look like you were working here with me during the abduction. 
I'm sorry, but whatever Buchanan laid out, you got to stick to it. 
We need to sideline Cheng now. 
Why? 
Now that Lee Jong's incriminated himself, the Chinese government's not gonna try to protect him. 
That's not what this is about. 
The Chinese consul was killed during Lee's extraction. 
The united states government cannot be held responsible for that. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
You have broken every major protocol set by CTU and the dod. 
For what? 
Is any of this working? 
You're still alive, your father's still alive, and we managed to stop all but one of the power plants from melting down. 
Yeah, it's working. 
We have to fight to keep it working. 
Do what you have to, Audrey. 
I'm sorry, I've got to go. 
Thank you. 
Hello. 
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack's 
approach to Marwan's location ready. 
Good. 
Upload it to the teams; send a copy to Tony's station. 
He's running point on this end. 
You got it. 
I am surprised that after you were kidnapped that you stayed on to work here. 
That must have been very difficult for you. 
I wasn't physically hurt, and I wanted to try and help find the people who had planned these attacks. 
Very admirable. 
Now, I looked through the hourlies for Mr. 
Bauer, your associate from the defense department. 
I noticed from 1:00 A.M. 
To 3:00 A.M, you and he were working 
on some data-processing tasks. 
Yes, that's correct. 
And what analyst did you give this information to? 
Edgar Stiles. 
Why does that matter? 
They go through all this trouble to reenlist a man who used to run this place Jack Bauer and he's doing data-processing? 
Well, it's much more subtle than it sounds. 
There are hundreds of lists that have to be cross-referenced, and with Mr. Bauer's experience, 
we were able to narrow the search. 
I am surprised. 
Why is that? 
Meaning no disrespect, the log shows that your husband,Paul Raines, was at the clinic during the same hours. 
And unfortunately, he passed away. 
What's your point? 
I don't believe you were with Jack Bauer, mining data. 
That you were waiting for your husband while he was in surgery, and that you are lying to me now to cover for Mr. Bauer. 
Mr. Cheng. 
I'm not going to allow you to stand there and accuse my people of lying. 
No. 
And I'm not going to stand here to endure half-baked alibis. 
You can believe whatever you want, but my answers stand. 
Now, if we are done, I do have to get back to work. 
If you'll excuse me. 
Manning. 
President Palmer for Jack Bauer. 
It's the White House. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, this is David Palmer. 
Mr. President. 
CTU tells me you got something from Lee. 
We got a location on Habib Marwan. 
We're en route with tactical teams now. 
We're hopeful we can put an end to this soon. 
I hope you're right, Jack. 
This warhead can detonate any moment now. 
We know, sir. 
Jack... 
tell me about the representative from the Chinese consulate, Cheng. 
Is he still at CTU? 
He was there when we left. 
Are we okay there? 
They have a surveillance photo of one of my team members. 
We told them that we didn't think the photo was clear enough to be conclusive evidence. 
That's gonna hold them off for a while. 
I see. 
Thank you, Jack. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
And good luck. 
Thank you, sir. 
All right, mike. 
I'm gonna need you to advise the President that Cheng has to leave CTU now. 
President Logan was clear that he wanted Cheng to have access there. 
And he has. 
But now Cheng is slowing them down. 
He's got to go. 
CTU needs to be able to do their job without the added pressure of a cover-up. 
You think you can get President Logan to sign off on that? 
I'll see what I can do. 
Yes. 
No, not now, Keith. 
I have too many things to deal with first. 
Yes, you do that. 
Thank you. 
What is it, mike? 
Mr. President, the Chinese 
security officer, Cheng, is still at CTU, and he seems to be slowing things down. 
Well, he wouldn't be there at all if Palmer hadn't authorized an attack on his consulate. 
It's too late to change that now, sir. 
Yes. 
Yes, it is. 
If we order Cheng to leave CTU now, it'll look like we've got something to hide, and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the justification they need to escalate this crisis. 
Mr. President, if we don't find 
that warhead before it's deployed, ten million americans could face annihilation. 
And we could be at war with a Billion Chinese. 
My advice, sir, is to worry about the americans now and the Chinese later. 
Your advice or David Palmer's advice? 
Both of ours. 
When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in, it wasn't so the two of you could form an alliance against me. 
Sir, that's not what's happening. 
No? 
Why don't you tell me what's happening. 
You and David Palmer are running this country while I'm taking phone calls from mid-level staffers. 
Would you like me to ask President Palmer to leave? 
No. 
Call CTU, tell Bill Buchanan to escort Mr. Cheng out of the building. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Curtis, put Michaels in play now. 
Chloe, this is Jack. 
We're at the perimeter outside the factory. 
Our men are getting into position. 
Can you confirm that Marwan's inside? 
I can't say for sure, but I'm detecting a microwave uplink to the building. 
Can you intercept it? 
No. 
It's got encryption. 
Okay, thanks. 
Are we ready? 
Yeah. 
How are we gonna confirm Marwan's inside there? 
We don'T. 
We're out of time. 
We move now. 
Give all teams a go. 
All right. 
All teams, it's a go. 
So you know, Mr. Buchanan, 
this matter will be pursued. 
I will return with a formal order for a more extensive investigation. 
I understand. 
In the meantime, if I were you, I'd focus my attention on the people's freedom coalition. 
I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators. 
We'll do everything we can to help you. 
Sir. 
Excuse me. 
Jack's team is at the staging area outside the building. 
I'll be right there. 
Mr. Cheng, excuse me, please. 
I have to get back. 
My men will escort you from the building. 
Thank you. 
Edgar. 
Excuse me. 
Edgar Stiles, communication analyst, right? 
Yeah. I'm busy. 
I forgot to ask Mr. Buchanan one last thing. 
Maybe you could help me. 
I can't help you. 
You should ask him. 
It's not classified. 
Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you were helping her earlier with some DOD files. 
Yeah, until she was called down to the clinic. 
So it was just you and Jack? 
What? 
Edgar, come here. 
I have to go. 
Bye. 
Thank you. 
You idiot. 
What? 
Just keep your mouth shut. 
I didn't say anything. 
The man who led the attack on our consulate was Jack Bauer. 
Pull up all his files. 
I want to look at them when I get back. 
Michael, are you in position? 
Roger that. 
He's at your two o'clock- take him out. 
Copy that. 
We're ready. 
Start the sequence. 
We're done here. 
Get the car. 
He's cornered in this room. 
Counter-flank and push him back to me. 
Copy that. 
Freeze. 
I've been waiting for this. 
You're too late. 
That hurts, doesn't it? 
Jack. 
Jack, what are you doing? 
We still need him. 
Go ahead, kill me. 
That won't stop the missile. 
What are you talking about? 
What are you talking about! 
Jack, we got a problem. 
Come here a second and look at this. 
Secure the prisoner. 
Oh, my god, they've got a missile. 
Have you got your comm unit? 
Patch it through to the computer. 
Tony, it's Jack. Can you hear me? 
Yeah, Jack. 
What's going on? 
I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead. 
It's been mounted on a missile. 
A missile? 
How can that be? 
I don't know. 
We're trying to get the feed over to you now. 
Hold on. 
Have you got it? 
Yeah. 
How much time have we got? 
52 seconds. 
Tony, can you see this? 
Yeah. 
Can you get a source of the transmission? 
Hang on a second. 
No, Jack- it's on an encrypted uplink. 
There's no way to trace it. 
Do a geography scan- see if you can pull a location. 
Chloe, are there any identifying specifics on the visual? 
Looks like a forest area, trees, a structure. 
Tony, we're out of time. 
We're trYing, Jack, but we can't I.D. 
The location it's too general. 
See if you can pick up a heat signature from the point of Ignition. 
We'll try it, but it's a wide radius. 
There're not gonna be enough time to stop it launched. 
Chloe, do you have anything. 
I'm trying the four band satellite, but it's not working, either.
