English subtitles by PoneyTeam For God's sake, pull yourself together. 
You didn't have to kill her. 
Yes, I did, because you didn't have the courage to kill her yourself. 
Courage? To poison a girl 
who did no harm to you at all? 
This is my husband Navi. 
This is Debbie's mother. 
Is she here? 
We haven't seen her since yesterday. 
Get in the car, follow her. 
Make sure she doesn't go to the police. 
Chloï¿½, you're out of here. 
Chloe. 
Don't worry, Edgar. Driscoll 
doesn't know you were helping me. 
She doesn't? 
I'm the one who got you into this, I'm not going to sell you out. 
We'll be here until you tell me what I need to know. 
Richard, your father was kidnapped by terrorists. 
Our polygraph analysis tells us you're hiding something that might help us find him. 
There are people on the outside looking for us. 
You cannot give up. 
I have to do something while I still can. 
This trial is going to be a spectacle, broadcast all over the world, designed to humiliate and degrade this country. 
There's a gas pipe. 
Did you check out the briefcase? 
Mm. It's fine. 
I was afraid it might be damaged in the train crash. 
The case is very strong. 
Come on! Get them out! 
Now! Come on! 
Hurry, open the door! Now! 
I know you. 
She recognized me. 
She has to be killed. 
Erin, I'm on sight. 
Jack, stand down. 
What are you talking about? 
The Marines won't get there on time. 
The President wants to take out the building with a missile strike. 
With the secretary and his daughter inside? 
Yes. 
I'm sorry. 
You're going to have to clear the area. 
Jack, don't go in there alone. 
Jack, clear the area! The 
building is going to be destroyed! 
The following takes places between 12:00 P.M. and 01:00 P.M. 
James Heller, you have been brought before this court of law to stand trial as a war criminal. 
We will prove to the people of the world that these crimes against humanity are the direct result of the polices initiated by you in your capacity. 
Since the true extent of your evil legacy is immeasurable, we have done our best to document those acts which have been witnessed directly by the chosen followers. 
Under your orders, the death squads of America, continue their imperious crusade against the true believers and pure followers. 
How much longer until the fighter is ready to launch the missile? 
Command and control is locking on target now. 
Mr. President, I have Erin 
Driscoll on line three. 
Mr. President, I'm calling 
to ask you to consider aborting the missile strike. 
Based on what? 
We are attempting a rescue operation. 
I was told that the Marine Strike Force was still 10 to 20 minutes away. 
They are, sir. 
Jack Bauer went in by himself. 
The terrorist group is moments away from executing the Secretary of Defense in front of the world. 
And I cannot allow that to happen. 
I understand, sir. 
But if Jack can effect a rescue before that happens... 
In that case, I'll abort the missile strike. 
But he's running out of time. 
How long does he have, sir? 
Seven minutes. 
Try and make a sound, I'll blow your head off. 
This is a map of the complex. 
Where are they holding the Secretary of Defense? 
I am either going to kill you now, or you're going to tell me where they are staging the trial! 
Point... now. Where is the secretary? 
There is no place in this world where your evil has not scoured the sacred land of the true word. 
Your imperialistic legacy has devoured the lives of the innocent. 
 Jack? 
 Yeah? 
The President won't call off the missile strike. 
How much time do I have? 
Less than six minutes. 
Did you get a read from the thermal scan on how many hostiles inside? 
We estimate 16. 
Jack? 
I'm not turning back, Erin. 
Understood. 
Good luck. 
...the injustices that 
you have committed... 
Stop this, please. 
...on behalf of... 
Just stop this, please. 
You've got to stop this. 
My father hasn't done anything to hurt you. 
He's an innocent man. Please! 
Please. He's innocent. 
Please. 
Listen to me. 
Please, no, no, no, wait, wait, no. 
You've got to stop it! Listen. 
Audrey? 
Behind you. 
Oh, my God. 
Jack! 
Are you all right? 
Did they hurt you? 
No, I'm okay. 
You've got to stop them. 
I will. 
Get my father first. 
Go. 
Take this. 
Press the button on the handle. 
You use that if you have to. 
I'll be back for you, I promise. 
Jack. 
Finally, we hold you responsible for blasphemy. 
For desecrating holy lands and shrines, and for spilling the blood of our brothers. 
James Heller, your guilt on these charges is not a matter of dispute. 
I have, here, a full confession that you have signed. 
And so, now, it is time for your sentence to be read and for the execution of that sentence to be carried out. 
James Heller, before the eyes of God, I sentence you to death... 
to be carried out... immediately. 
Call off the missile. Call it off! 
Abort. Abort. Please confirm. 
He's doing it. 
There's one in the pipe, safety's off. 
We've got to get Audrey. 
Down the hall. 
It's been aborted. 
The strike's been called off. 
Where are the Marines? 
They haven't crossed the perimeter. 
I'll get an updated E.T.A. 
We're clear. 
She was here. 
We got to go. Move! 
Take the two shooters at your 11:00. 
You ready? Go! 
Give me a clip. 
Jack! 
It went off my vest. 
It's all right. Keep firing. 
I'm out. 
I'm out, too. 
It's the Marines. Stay down! 
Mr. Secretary, stay down. 
Just stay down until this area is secure. 
Jack! 
Jack! Jack! 
Put the gun down! 
Step back or I'll kill her! 
Put the gun down! 
Step back! I will kill her! 
Step back! 
I will kill her! 
I will kill her! 
Do it! 
Okay. Okay, just relax. 
Now just stay calm. 
Just relax. 
This is over. 
You're surrounded. 
You're right. 
First, you'll watch her die. 
Yes, sir. 
The President sends along his gratitude. 
I'm just glad you both are all right. 
It's been a while since you've been in the field, Jack. 
Looks like you haven't skipped a beat. 
Audrey and I owe you our lives. 
Thank you, sir. 
I've arranged transportation for us back to CTU. 
I'd like you and Audrey to be debriefed there. 
Just as long as we don't lose any time in finding out who these terrorists are and where they're coming from. 
As soon as we get back there, I'll set up a live feed with the office in Washington. 
You won't miss a step. 
Those soldiers there are waiting to take us back  to CTU. 
 Thanks. 
How's she doing? 
The doctor needs to check out some of these contusions and she's dehydrated. 
Thank you. 
 You should go. 
 Where? 
I'm taking you and your father back to CTU Jack, when I was inside, I-I recognized one of the men. 
Who? 
I don't know. 
I-I can't place him, but I know that I saw him before today. 
They're going to correlate a photo file of all the casualties. 
As soon as they've got that, you can make your I.D. 
Excuse me. Bauer. 
Agent Bauer, this is CTU. 
I've got Paul Raines, on the line. 
He'd like to speak to his wife. 
Is she with you? 
Hold on one second. 
It's Paul. 
He wants to speak with you. 
Paul. 
Audrey. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine. 
Thank God. 
Where are you? 
As soon as I heard about you and your father, I got on a plane. 
You're in L.A.? 
Yeah. I'm at CTU. 
Audrey? 
Yeah. 
See you soon. 
I'll see you soon. 
We need to go. 
You all right? 
Mm-hmm. 
Make sure Edgar gets this. 
Find anything? 
I'm still trying to connect up with the feed from the rescue site. 
Division is using up most of our bandwidth. 
Call over there and tell them to multiplex. We need to start 
going through the debris. 
Yeah, now that Heller is safe, we're no longer in first position. 
Miss Driscoll. 
I took care of it. 
What's that? 
Our list of passcodes for the FBI fiber. 
You can use their feed. 
How did you get that? 
I used to consult there. 
I still have friends. 
As soon as I saw the load on the routing table, I knew we'd run into a traffic jam. 
Good. Install it. 
Start cataloging whatever's there. Anything that flags, 
promote it up to me. 
You know... if 
you let me, Curtis, I can help you a whole lot more. 
Honestly, I don't even know why you have a problem with me. 
Because I'm ambitious? 
Okay, I'm ambitious. Aren't you? 
I don't sleep with people to get ahead in my career. 
Neither do I. 
I slept with you because I was attracted to you. 
I still am. 
Deal with it. 
A White House spokesman has just confirmed that the interrupted video transmission was caused by a raid mounted by the Marines and the counter-terrorist unit, who rescued Secretary of Defense James Heller moments ago. 
Yes, I'm watching. 
Of course I'm watching. 
God willing, our good fortune will continue for the rest of the day. 
Thank you. 
What are you talking about? 
It's over. 
They found Omar. 
The government stopped the trial. 
Yes, I know. 
Then how can you say this is all good fortune? 
Everything we've worked for is ruined. 
You made me kill someone I cared about, all for nothing. 
No, not for nothing, Behrooz. 
The trial was only our first step. 
I don't understand. 
There were certain things that your mother and I decided to keep from you. 
What things? 
Please, I'm busy. 
You forced me to kill my girlfriend because of this trial. 
You owe me an explanation. 
I don't owe you anything! 
See who it is. 
See who it is! 
It's Terrick. 
Why is he here? 
Terrick. 
Behrooz, you remember Terrick. 
Of course he does. 
I just spoke with Madwan. 
He assured me that everything is still on schedule. 
 That's right. 
 What are you doing here? 
Your mother told Madwan you took care of the American girl? 
Yeah? 
Then you'll need help getting rid of the body. 
I don't need any help. 
I can do it myself. 
I'm sure you can, Behrooz, but we can't afford any more mistakes. 
Show Terrick where the body is. 
Go. 
Okay, Agent Manning, this is the last of the bodies. 
 You shoud see them now. 
 All right. Got it. 
What's next? 
Here's some more of the terrorist gear we collected out of the warehouse. 
Wait a second. 
top. Go back. 
You need me to retransmit? 
No. On the ground 
in front of you. Can you give 
me a shot of that briefcase? 
This? 
Yeah. Can you open it? 
It's empty. 
Are there any identifying marks on it? 
Some kind of logo engraved near the lock. 
Let me see. Zoom in. 
Zoom in. 
Make sure that gets on the next transport back here. 
Will do. 
Sarah. I need you 
to do a corporate logo search. I may have found 
a link between the train crash and Heller's abduction. 
I'm sending it to you now. 
Okay. We'll pick this up later. 
The man I recognized at the warehouse I want to make that ID. 
As soon as you've been checked out by the clinic. 
I'll get the photos ready. 
Excuse me, Ms. Raines. 
This way, please. 
It's all right. Go ahead. 
Okay good. 
Excuse us. 
I'm going to need to use your station. 
Have Driscoll send me over a passcode for the onsite feed. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
Does he know? 
About you and Jack. 
How long have you known? 
Not until today. 
Although I'm surprised that I hadn't figured it out till now. 
But it's not what you think. 
Paul and I were over before Jack and I started seeing each other. 
Except Paul doesn't think it's over. 
Last time I spoke with him, he thought he had a second chance. 
Yeah, well, that's more about fixing his wounded pride than fixing this relationship. 
So he doesn't know about it. 
Not yet. 
I'll take care of it. 
This way, please. 
Yeah. 
No, not till I get back to DC. 
Sarah said you may have found a thread connecting the train bombing to Heller's abduction. 
Yeah. About an hour ago, NTSB 
reported that a passenger was killed, but not as a result of the crash. 
He was shot at close range. 
Who is he? 
We're still trying to find out. 
He had no I.D. 
His face and prints don't show up on any database. 
But whoever killed him stole something he had chained to his wrist. 
I think it may have been this. 
A witness on the train saw a man with a briefcase handcuffed to him. 
Take a look at the damage. 
It could have been sustained during the crash. 
We just recovered this where Heller was being held. 
What are you telling me? 
That the train bombing was a cover for the theft of this briefcase? 
What was in it? 
It was empty. 
We traced the corporate logo on the briefcase to McLennen-Forster. 
 The defense contractor? 
 Yeah. 
Have you contacted them? 
Just got off the phone with their CEO. 
He stonewalled. 
Said before he disclosed anything, we'd need special clearance from the Department of Defense. 
The Secretary should be able to get us whatever clearances we need from DOD. 
Let's get a printout of all this. 
Yeah. 
...story, only moments ago, a second 
broadcast showing secretary of defense James Heller was put on the internet. This 
image was captured from that broadcast. 
At this time, we have no confirmed report on why the broadcast... 
The girl's mother went home. 
Even if she calls the police, it will be too late. 
I heard the news in the car. 
Everything was accomplished? 
Yes. 
The trial was cut short, but it served its purpose. 
When they search the warehouse, will they figure out what we're doing? 
It doesn't matter. 
It's too late for them to stop it. 
If everything is working on schedule, why do you look so troubled? 
Where is Behrooz? 
He went to bury the girl. 
But his car is still in the driveway. 
He didn't take the car. 
I don't understand. 
He went with Tariq. 
Tariq was here? 
Oh, my God. 
He's going to kill my son. 
Oh, my God. 
He's going to kill our son. 
Yes. 
I told Madwan that Behrooz took care of the girl. 
Madwan must not have been satisfied. 
He must have decided that Behrooz was a liability. 
How could you let this happen? 
How could you let them kill our son? 
What could I do? 
What could I do?! 
He's our son! 
Our flesh and blood! 
Dina, listen to me. 
How could you let them kill our son! 
Behrooz stopped being our son a long time ago. 
How can you say that? 
Because it's true. 
Living here has changed him. 
He's been like a stranger to us. 
He proved it to me today that he no longer believes in our cause. 
Maybe... 
he never did. 
Behrooz... 
Behrooz... Behrooz... 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Secretary Heller would like to say a few words. 
I'm incredibly privileged to have the finest people in the world behind me. 
All of you. 
It's going to take a lot more than a few words to express my feelings, but for now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. 
Secretary Heller, Curtis Manning, head of Tactical. 
Curtis. 
An honor, sir. 
Please, sit down. 
Erin, my daughter and I owe you our lives. 
It sounds like you had to make some tough calls, but you made the right ones. 
I'll see to it that you get full recognition for a job exceptionally well done. 
Thank you, sir. 
Now, before we start the debriefing, I'd like to visit with my son. 
Where is he? 
We're actually holding Richard here, sir. 
Why is that? 
When we brought Richard in, we gave him a polygraph. 
It indicated that he was possibly withholding information from us. 
About my kidnapping? 
My son and I have wildly different political views, but I can't believe that he was involved. 
We don't think he had knowing participation, but we believe he shared knowledge of your whereabouts this morning with someone, and he refuses to divulge their information or their identity. 
And what are you doing about that? 
We discussed a number of options. 
You have to understand the circumstances. 
Stop BS'ing me. What 
did you do to him? 
There's a technique that's noninvasive called sensory disorientation. 
You subjected my son to SDT? 
Yes, sir, we did. 
But it was stopped the moment  you were rescued. 
 Jack, did you know about this? 
No, sir. 
I want to see my son now. 
Of course. 
Curtis. 
Erin, I realize you've been under a lot of pressure these past few hours, but you better have cause for this. 
Jack? 
I appreciate you not involving the Secretary in the differences you and I had on this operation. 
We both did what we thought was right, Erin. 
I'd like to put the past behind us, Jack. 
I could use your help. 
What do you need? 
I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position as head of Field Ops until we avert this crisis. 
Whatever I can do to help. 
Let me make one thing clear. 
Ronnie was under my command, and you will be, too. 
Understood. 
The photos from the warehouse are they ready for Audrey Raines to see? 
I believe so. 
I'll have Edgar port them to a workstation. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Dad. 
They said you were okay. 
Audrey, too. Thank God. 
I said some awf... 
awful things before. 
I was afraid I'd never get a chance to apologize. 
I said some pretty harsh things myself. 
But, no matter what was said, you're still my son, and I will always love you. 
Me, too, Dad. 
They said they were using some interrogation techniques. 
They were totally out of line. 
I am going to sue them blind. 
I think it'll be a little more effective if you let me deal with it. 
I promise you, if they were out of line, heads will roll. 
What do you mean, "if"? 
Why did they think you were holding something back from them? 
I don't know. 
Richard, if you know something that would shed some light on what happened to me... 
What, you don't think I would tell them if I thought it was relevant? 
So there is something? 
Now you're giving me the third degree? 
Son, do you have any idea what your sister just went through? 
If you know anything that would help us find the people behind this, tell me now. 
Dad... 
I'm glad you're alive. 
I... I really am. 
But I am not going to tell these people things about my private life that they don't need to know. 
That you don't think they need to know. 
Richard, these people were trying to save our lives! 
These people can't be trusted! 
What they did to me is proof. 
Agent Manning, could you come in here, please? 
Agent Manning, I am authorizing you to do whatever you feel is necessary to get this information out of my son. Dad... 
I love you, son, but I have a duty to my country. 
You can't be serious. 
Dad! 
Bring the shovels from the back. 
Come on. Help me. 
They said it was okay to come in. 
Hi, Paul. 
My God, I was so worried. 
Are you hurt? 
No, just some cuts and scrapes, nothing serious. 
Sure? 
Yeah, really. I'm okay, Paul. 
They've okayed me for my debriefing. 
On the flight over, I couldn't stop thinking about us. 
How when we separated we said that we'd both take time to figure out what we wanted and... 
now I know. 
Paul. 
I want us to be together again. 
I'm ready to work at it. 
I'll make our marriage first priority. 
Just give us a chance. 
I'm sorry, Paul. 
That's not what I want. 
Audrey, I... 
I am a fool for bringing this up now. 
You can't make decisions about our relationship when you're in this state. Paul. 
I'm seeing someone. 
Well, how long has this been going on? 
Six months. 
You love him, or...? 
Yes. 
Audrey? 
I'm sorry. Excuse me. 
I'll come back later. 
No. Um... 
Paul, this is Jack Bauer. 
Nice to meet you. 
You're the one that saved Audrey's life. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Those photos are ready for you to look at. 
Okay. 
Um, Paul, we'll talk later? 
Yeah. 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
You ready to go? 
Not yet. 
Now i am. 
No. 
 No. 
 You're absolutely certain you saw this guy before the compound. 
Positive, and I could  tell that he recognized me. 
 Okay. 
No. 
No. 
That's all of them. 
He must have gotten out before the rescue. 
Okay, we should go through the pictures again just to make sure. 
I will, but there are only two men here who aren't Middle Eastern, and neither one of them are him. 
What? 
I just remembered where I saw him before. 
Where? 
There was a Heritage Foundation dinner about two months ago, at the Hyatt downtown, here. 
Do you remember his name? 
No, but I know someone at the foundation. 
Maybe I can get the guest list. 
 Okay, good. 
 Agent Bauer? 
Driscoll wants you in a conference call that's starting in a few minutes. 
Okay, fine. I need 
you to get ahold of the Hyatt hotel security department. 
Get access to their archival video surveillance. 
Audrey will give you a time and a date. 
Set a parameter, keep Driscoll informed. 
I'll be right back. 
It's hot. 
You brought me here to kill me! Why?! 
Why are you doing this?! 
I did everything they told me to do. 
You know why. 
I took care of the girl. Madwan knows! 
It's not Madwan that wants you dead. 
Who wants me dead? 
Who?! 
Who wants me dead? 
I want to know! Tell me! 
Your father. 
No! 
No! 
It's not true! 
No! No! 
Please! 
Please! 
No! 
Mr. Reese, 
I'm Erin Driscoll, Director of CTU Los Angeles. 
My colleagues Curtis Manning and Sarah Gavin are also present. 
Also, Jack Bauer who's Special Advisor to Secretary Heller. 
Ms. Driscoll, I 
hope you understand. 
We at McLennen-Forster couldn't give you details about that case until we received the appropriate permission from DOD. 
Understood, Mr. Reese. 
May we please begin? 
What was your courier transporting? 
It's a device we developed under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Emergency Management Program. 
It's a Dobson-type override. 
What exactly does this override do? 
It's a combination of hardware and software that can remotely take control of a nuclear power facility. 
Under what circumstances would the override be used? 
The government wanted to be able to control a plant's nuclear pile in the event of a disaster that necessitated evacuation. 
And the person in possession of this program, could they do the opposite with it, create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown? 
Theoretically, yes. 
But merely having possession of the override wouldn't be enough. There 
are safeguards in place. 
What kind of safeguards? 
Anyone who's trying to use the override would have to hack through the reactor's firewall. 
That would take massive computer power, which NRC could see coming a mile away. 
Is it possible that NRC could miss this due to unusually heavy traffic on the Internet? 
I don't follow. 
Well, less than an hour ago, millions of computers around the world were streaming the trial of the Secretary of Defense. 
Is it possible that this trial was just some kind of a Trojan horse to disguise a massive attack on nuclear power plants' firewalls? 
That might be possible. 
How many nuclear power plants in this country would be vulnerable? 
All of them. 
How many is that? 
At this time, the United States has 104 nuclear power plants online. 
We have to assume that they've used this override to take over these plants. 
Get me NRC now and find Secretary Heller. 
Thank you, Mr. Reese. 
Set up an all-department briefing. 
Get me NRC, now. 
Pipe it through here. 
I want all personnel in the conference area. 
Edgar... 
can you monitor my allocation tables for a few minutes? 
Sure. 
Yes? 
It's me. 
You're on a secure line? 
Yes. 
I would've checked in sooner. 
This was the first chance I got. 
All right. Go on. 
They find out about the override.
