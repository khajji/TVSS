Mr. President, with respect to the 
death of Alan Milliken, I know you lied. 
You told the police Sherry was with you at the time of Milliken's death. 
Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle prove otherwise. 
What do you want? 
Your resignation. 
Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right? 
Now, I can call Foxton, and he can make this all disappear. 
You mean steal evidence. 
Jack, I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders out of the building without authorization. 
Saunders has Michelle. 
He wants to trade her for his daughter. 
Tony, put that gun on the dash You help me make this trade, I will turn myself in. 
Go to prison, whatever is gotta happen. 
We don't have a visual on Saunders. 
I repeat we don't have a visual on Saunders Keep your teams down. Stay down 
I can't Jane, it's ok, come here Team A and B move Move now Stephen I am pinned down Saunders has a helicopter Call in air support now 11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for. 
Where are they? 
It's not going to be that simple, Jack This is Jack Bauer Saunders is in custody. 
The following takes place between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm. 
We just got verification from Saunders' computer. 
There's 11 vials across the country How long till you can give us their location? 
I am not sure I can. 
Saunders applied a sophisticated decryption overlay. 
An unauthorized access will auto erase the file structure. 
 I will keep trying  Ok Where are the 11 vials? 
You are wasting your time, and I am not foolish enough to have that information in there. 
Where are the vials? 
In the hands of dedicated men, true believers. 
Believers in what? 
That's the greatest threat to world peace comes from this country. 
There's a hotel not far from here where 800 innocent people are dead or dying because of you. 
Were they a threat to your world peace? 
The United States must be forced to retreat within its own borders. 
Those people are simply the first casualties of war. 
What happened to you, Stephen? 
I was abandoned by the people I worked for As you will be some day But my message will be heard in less than 1 hour What are you talking about? 
My couriers have been instructed to release the virus at noon. 
They are in fail safe mode and they can't be recalled. 
Tell us where they are, we will stop them. 
That is possible, but only if you agree to my terms. 
What are your terms? 
I have a private jet waiting at Van Nuys airport. 
I need to be on it with presidential guarantee of safe passage to North Africa. 
Never going to happen. 
Then hundreds of thousands will die. 
I know what you are thinking, Jack But the Bosnian secret police worked on me for 2 years and couldn't break me Do you really think you will be able to do it in less than an hour? 
Get me on that plane, Jack You don't have a choice. 
Bring me Jane Saunders. 
I'm gonna need your gun, Tony. 
Frisk him Hey  You don't have to do that  I have got my orders. 
 You take it easy. He's one of us. 
 Not any more What's going on? 
My orders are to take Almeida into custody. 
That's straight from Brad Hammond at Division. 
I am sorry, Tony There's nothing we can do right now Just take care of business, Jack I'll be all right He said you wanted to see me? 
I need you to speak with your father. 
What do you want me to say? 
Try and make it personal. 
Try to connect with him. 
Tell him you are scared that you don't want him to do this I will try I know what's going to happen, and I know you can stop it Please I wont let them use you to manipulate me Despite everything that's happened I love you And I asking you, please don't let this happen This doesn't make any sense. 
It doesn't make any sense to you because you haven't seen what I have seen You don't understand I know you think what happened to you is the governments fault, and maybe it is But the people who are going to die are innocent. 
Ant that's tragic, Jane. 
But it has to happen for things to change and they must change How can you do something like this? 
I am doing it for your sake For my sake? 
For you and your children And after it, the world will be a better place Please, Dad Please Please, don't do this Jane, I don't expect you to understand now. 
But one day you will And you will look back and you will thank me for what I have done Yeah Oh, my god Jane Jane We are on the move, get the choppers ready Hello Sherry, Its David Hello, David I have been thinking things over What Keeler offered you, how did you put it? 
A seat at the table? 
Yeah, something like that Well, there my be a seat at my table. 
Its a little too late for that, David Sherry, I think its in both our best interests for you to hear what I have to offer. 
All right, I am listening No, not on the phone In person Where, then? 
The Oakcliff Building, downtown I know it Good. I will meet you there in 25 minutes. 
That's a short notice, David But you will be there You are in no position to be making demands here Sherry, I have a schedule to keep. 
If I start changing things around, it will attract attention and I don't think either one of us wants that. 
All right, David I will hear what you have to say Fine Yeah She should be leaving soon to meet me I know shed go for it Oh, she's enjoying having me over a barrel. 
I could hear it in her voice Don't worry about that, David If we can find this prescription bottle, all her leverage is gone. 
How long will you need in the house The more time we have, the better our chance of finding it I will do whatever I can to keep her there with me All right Wayne, find it Take a look at your handiwork You murdered these people, Stephen Whole families Sometimes a fire needs to be lit in order to put out another fire. 
I don't want to hear your justification This is over You are going to tell me how to find the rest of the vials now Or you'll send me inside the hotel? 
I am prepared to die for my cause, Jack Yeah, I know Chase Yeah, Jack Come in Copy that What are you doing, Jack? 
Why did you bring me here? 
Ask your father, its up to him Dad? 
Tell me how to find your couriers, Stephen Or I am going to put her in that building You wouldn't dare. She has nothing to do with this 
Neither do the people in those body bags I am going to do everything I have to stop you from releasing more of this virus. 
How could you do this? 
I am going to give you one chance You are not Tell me how I find them You know you cant do this, Jack You are a government agent Send her in Take her inside now No Dad, stop them Stop it Dad, please No, no, no Everything that happens to your daughter is because of you. 
Dad, stop, no, no, no Get her out of there, Jack Jack, get her out of there Where are the vials? 
Get her out of there How do I find the vials? 
Dad Let her go Do as I say now, Jack! 
When your daughter is infected, I am going to make you watch her die Bauer, let her go Let her go You are running out of time, Stephen Stephen, you are out of time Stop, stop, stop, I will tell you Just don't harm her How do I find the vials? 
Each one is tagged with a GPS locator chip so that I can track them right up until t he moment they are released. 
Where are the locator codes? 
In my head You memorized all 11? 
Yeah, get her out of there Bring Jane out from the tunnel now. 
Let's go Jack, we have picked up 10 of the 11 GPS signals coming off the vials. 
Why are we missing a signal? 
I don't know. I gave you the correct codes. 
Where's the 11th vial? 
Los Angels What's the target? 
His instruction were to select a public place where maximum casualties would be inflicted. 
What's his name? 
I know him as Arthur Rabens. 
But I am assuming that's not his real name. 
We need a description Take him back to holding over at CTU. 
I want him working with a sketch artist immediately. 
What about Jane? 
She stays here Kaufman Adam, its Jack I need you to do an all agency search on the name Arthur Rabens. 
Saunders believes it might be a alias Ok, I am on it, Jack Has district sent anyone over to replace Tony? 
Actually, yeah, Brad Hammond just got here right now Ok, let me speak to him One second Mr. Hammond 
I have Jack Bauer for you on line 6 Good, thank you Jack I have been briefed on CTU activity to this point We are relaying the coordinates of the 10 vials to local police, NHS and HazMat across the country But we still cant lock on a signal from the 11th vial The 11th vial is in Los Angeles. 
The couriers name is Arthur Rabens Although Saunders believes that that might be an alias. 
There's no predetermined target Did he tell you the truth Yeah. Right now he thinks we are willing 
to kill his daughter if he doesn't cooperate. 
But our best bet is to lock on to that signal. 
I understand everyone in comm. is working on it 
Brad, I know you took Tony Almeida into custody. 
But now that his wife is safe, I think he might be a real asset to us. 
I am sorry, Jack, but there's not going to be any special treatment. 
For Gods sakes, Brad Four and a half years ago, I was put in the exact same position as Tony's been put in today. 
Victor Darzen kidnapped my wife and daughter, and I went outside of CTU to get them back. 
And no one put me in prison. 
The circumstances were different And the outcome will be the same, we will prevail. 
The entire operation was put at risk because of what he did This operation started a year ago with Gael, Tony and myself. 
Gael gave his life, I became an addict just to maintain my cover, and now you are sending Tony to prison? 
Its wrong Brad, its wrong and you know it. 
You should be putting a medal on him not handcuffs. 
Jack, you can testify at his hearing. 
Right now, we have got work to do. 
Where's Michelle? 
She's here Can I talk to her, please? 
First thing first Plachecki's coming over from the attorney Generals office to take your official statement. 
You are entitled to have a lawyer present. 
Look, I don't need a lawyer, Brad I did what I did What you did, Tony, is punishable by the death penalty. 
Death penalty What did you expect? 
You committed treason That was not my intent. 
You facilitated the escape of a man who was responsible for the death of Ryan Chappell and almost a thousand civilians, who was contemplating killing millions of others. 
Then you tried to neutralize the only leverage we had over him, by giving him back his daughter. 
So what's the bottom line? 
I will testify to the fact that your service record is long and for the most part, distinguished. 
With luck, the best you can hope for is 20 years Sherry should have left by now Yeah, well, she's taking her time So she can make the President wait. 
Wayne Palmer Wayne I told you not to call me I don't have anyone else I am sorry, but I cant help you right now The police are coming back to arrest me, Wayne, for murdering Alan Because they don't believe that Sherry was here I know what happened Then why didn't you tell them the truth? 
My lawyer says that the President is backing Sherry's story. 
Is it true? 
Is your brother covering for Sherry? 
I don't know, Julia. 
Don't lie to me Listen, I am sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you right now. 
Please Just don't, don't hang up. 
I will call you as soon as I can, I promise Wayne I am so scared I know, I know We loved each other once Help me I have to go, Julia Wayne I am sorry Chief of Staff to the President of the United States and I am committing a burglary It's an historic moment Foxton, Sherry can never know we were here. 
You do what I say, and she wont Lets get to work Jack This is the tactical feed from San Francisco They are apprehending Saunders courier. 
He's not breathing He's been neutralized Sniper took him down with a head shot. 
We have got it The vial is intact. 
Repeat, we have the vial One down, 10 to go You check the kitchen? 
Yeah, for the second time There is nothing there Well, it looks like Mrs. Palmer 
believes in better living through chemistry. 
But none of the bottles are Milliken's. 
Damn it Relax If she's hidden it here, well find it. 
How can you be so sure? 
Because she's not a professional, and I am Sherry David Lets take a walk Well, actually, I just wanted to get to the point What is it that you have decided? 
I decided to give you what you want A place in my administration Well, that's what you implied over the phone, but I thought I was here so that you could be a little more specific. 
You will be my de facto right hand, involved in all major decisions. 
Involved how? 
On everything from ambassadorial appointments to legislative proposals, you will be one of my primary consultants. 
One of your consultants? 
Right Good-bye, David Why? Where are you going? 
Back home, because this conversation is over. 
Why? 
That's just not good enough I am not going to be relegated to some informal role so that you can ignore me whenever you choose. 
Why don't you just tell me what you want? 
I want a permanent position, David, in your administration and in your life. 
I don't understand I want to be your wife again You what? 
I don't expect to have the kind of physical intimacy that we used to have, although maybe in time that will come, but I really want be Mrs. David Palmer again 
The first lady, right by your side in Washington wherever you go Sherry, I don't know what to say. 
You can start by saying yes Or I walk for good Are you prepared to have me be your wife again? 
Yes Really? 
Oh, David Oh, God We should talk about the details. 
Work out a timeline How we expose this to the public Wait a minute I know you a little better than this, David Something's not right here. 
You are making this all too easy There's, there's something else going on I am giving you what you asked for. 
No, no, no, you are not You are toying with me And I don't know why, and frankly, I don't care You just consider my offer rescinded. 
John Keeler will be the next President of the United States. 
Yeah She's on her way back David, we need more time We haven't found anything yet Look, I tried to keep her here as long as I could, but she knew something was wrong Wayne, you should leave We are not done She will be there soon, you have no choice David, hold on There's a safe David, we found a safe in a hidden cellar. 
Can you open it in time? 
Can you get in? 
Its an Evans Stoller, so forget about cracking it All these electronic safes have manufacturer override codes. 
I have a guy who can get them for us. 
One of them will work How long Depends on how long it takes to get him on the phone David, we may have just found a way. 
You'd better. You are running out of time. 
The suspect has used a titanium clamp to secure the device to a railing. 
We are defusing on the site Wilson, what's your status? 
The suspect's in custody New York Times' men's around. Virus is contained 
Yeah Seattle, Las Vegas' secured, suspect's taken down making a phone call Ok, hold on Jack, we got the couriers in Las Vegas and Seattle without incident. 
But Saunders man in Denver was making a phone call when he was killed. 
Did he complete the call? Did he warn the other couriers? 
We don't know We got to find that out Chloe, I am getting a level 2 SAT transmission from the LA grid Are you sure? What are the coordinates? 
Alpha 1733 at Delta 401 That's downtown. Lock in on the SAT field 
Its done Transfer to my screen Ok This is Jack Jack, its Chloe What do you got? 
Saunders is telling the truth Rabens is in Los Angeles. 
Where? 
He's on south Flower heading northwest. 
We got a location I want you to extrapolate his path. 
Cross reference it with a list of probably public targets. 
Already done The most likely match is the California Center. 
A mall makes sense. 
I want you to get units over there to evacuate and secure the area. We are on our way. 
I just tried to see Tony Security said you are denying me access. 
He's a prisoner, Michelle. 
I'm his wife. He did what he did to save my life 
I am aware of that And because of that he's being charged with treason. 
Treason? 
Brad, look, I know that he broke protocol by taking Jane Saunders out of CTU, But he would never have given her up Because of him, we were able to catch Saunders We had Saunders 2 hours ago, and Tony let him escape No one told you? 
We had Saunders trapped in a building downtown. 
We were ready to drop the net, and Tony pulled unites out of position so Saunders could get away. 
Brad, it was an impossible choice No, it wasn't Tony has a sworn duty to protect the people of this country Putting your life first was treasons And he's going to prison for it. 
Brad I want you to put yourself in his place, Michelle. 
If you would have made the same call, you should resign right now. 
The target is still moving north at 40 miles per hour How long until we intercept? 
About a minute How are we doing on the other vials? 
They got the Flagstaff couriers and the other 2 in Washington. 
Rabens is the last one. 
Ok, make your next right. 
You should be coming up right behind him. 
Ok, I am turning right onto Flower. 
The target is less than a block ahead of you. 
You should have a visual. 
Chloe, there's no vehicles within range. 
Are you sure the targets still in the vehicle? 
Of course, he's traveling 40 miles per hour You are closing Target is less than 50 feet ahead of you There's no cars in front of us, Chloe. 
You need to recheck your signals. 
Its not possible Yes, it is He's underneath us Chloe, the targets on the subway Can you access the MTA's disaster response system? 
Yes, we can access their control center directly. 
Ok, we need to stop the train in the tunnel before it hits the station. 
Logging onto their system. 
Has Adam been able to turn up a photo on Rabens yet? 
No, and Saunders hasn't completed the identity sketch. 
Ok, they're accepting my request to stop the train in the tunnel just short of the station. 
Do you want me to tell MTA to close the station? 
No, absolutely not. 
If Rabens notices anything out of the ordinary, he might release the virus. 
I am going to need 20 personnel undercover and a backup HazMat team ASAP. 
Okay, we've got men nearby. 
I will tell Hammond to order the redeployment. 
Yeah, Foxton here. 
I've got this codes for the safe. 
Ok, give me the first one That didn't work Got another one? 
Come on, come on, come on Did you hear that? 
There's a car coming no Sherry is here Look, I need you to be quiet We need to get the hell out of here Quiet The next one Damn it, Foxton, come on Got it Its not here All right, come on. 
That's it, lets go What? 
I didn't come this far to leave empty handed. 
Wayne What's going on here? 
Answer me. What? 
Oh, now I understand why David wanted to meet me. 
But I am so surprised to find you here doing his dirty work. 
I have never done anything to hurt you, Wayne David put you up to this, didn't he? 
Sherry, I�� Answer me, David put�� There will be a short delay due to a stalled train ahead. 
Chase, what's your location? 
I am covering the east side of the tracks Copy that. 
Chase, I've got a visual on you coming down the stairs. 
Everything in place with the MTA? 
They are ready to move the train into the station. 
Team A and B, are you in position? 
Roger. We are in position. 
Rabens' description white male, dark hair, brown eyes, none descript Chloe, release the train Release the hold on the train, release the train Train doors are opening The target is moving off the train North or south? 
North Target is moving north All teams remain in your zones. 
 Chloe  go ahead can you check the altitude on a GPS signal? 
If I triangulate. 
Positive, target is changing altitude. 
Target is moving upstairs. 
We have got 10 remaining white males. 
Target is now moving west Team A, split off and maintain pace. 
Target is now moving south. 
Target is now descending. 
He's heading to the Seventh Street exit Coming right towards you, Jack Target is heading south I got a visual. 4 white remaining males. 
I want all teams to start closing in. 
I repeat, all teams start closing in What have you got, Chloe? 
Target is now moving west Target has stopped moving The target has stopped I have identification on the target White male at my 6 o'clock. 
He's looking at the map I am initiating takedown Drop the bag Get on the ground, now. Don't move 
What's going on? 
Where is it? 
Where's what? 
Where is it? 
Chase What are you guys doing? What's going on? 
I have got the signal. 
Should we wait for HazMat No, its either in the vial or we are already contaminated. 
What is this? 
Those aren't mine. I don't even�� 
Shut up Son of a bitch Its just the transmitter This isn't Rabens. 
He knows we are on to him He's still got the vial Shut the station down, now Julia Stay here, I will be right back Where are you going? 
Just stay here Julia, what are you doing here? 
The police think I killed Alan Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut Its nobody's fault but your own What are you doing with a gun? 
You don't want to do this I am going to jail for the rest of my life because of you Julia Julia That isn't true, Julia No, wait. Relax. We're alright here. 
You got to put that gun down No, no, she's the one who should be going to jail My life is ruined, don't you understand that? 
Julia, please, we can, we can work this out He's right We can work it out Shut up, shut up You have been lying your entire life You are not going to lie your way out of this You are right But right now, Julia, I am telling you the truth I will go to David and he will pardon you. 
Now, I was just with him, just now I am going to be his wife again. 
He will do whatever I say I promise you, you will not spend one day in jail Isn't that so, Wayne? 
Julie, listen, you will have everything you have always wanted. 
You will have your freedom, you'll have Alan's estate. 
You just think about it, sweetie I promise, you will be set for life Good, good. That is real good 
That's good My God. Sherry. 
I am so sorry No! 
Oh, God, no, please Take up position at the end of the platform. 
Jack, we have detained everyone in the station. 
We shut it down in time No ones left since the train came in Ok, set up a team and start searching the tunnels.

Ptoudly Presents Ghost Whisperer Season 3 Episode 10 hey, the after work rush is still a couple of hours off. 
i can handle this for now if you want to get a head start on your shopping. 
head start? 
head start is shopping in november. 
ok, i'm talking about desperation shopping right now. 
i have to check out a couple of things first. 
wait a second,  you are not still having christmas eve dinner at your house? 
yes, i am. don't ask me how. 
i'm hoping that santa claus will give me rachael ray for christmas, and then maybe she can handle it. 
look, i know this may not be politically correct in your world, but can't this situation wait until after the holidays? 
by situation, you mean haunting, correct? 
well, you know,  you say tomato, i say no, it can't wait. 
there's too much anxiety and negative energy in this house. 
this ghost could get very powerful very fast, and he really has it out for william. 
so what is it you're looking for? 
anything i can find on william taylor enemies,  deaths of relatives. 
the only recent death i've been able to find is his father, but i saw a picture of him at their house, and it's not him. 
 something to do th his work? 
 ugh, i hope not. 
his work is in mergers and acquisitions. 
his company does  a lot of takeovers. 
i don't know,  it's very coorate. 
yeah, well,  somebody like that has a lot of heavy duty enemies. 
maybe you should concentrate on the hostile takeovers, or the people who lost their jobs in the mergers. 
oh, that's a good idea. 
at least it would narrow it down. 
to about a hundred. 
daddy? 
oh, it's--i think someone's in the house. 
 well, are you sure? 
 yeah. i heard them downstairs. 
ok. 
ok, come here, riley. 
riley, you get on the phone and you call 9-1-1. 
and you do not come out of this room, ok? 
dad? 
what is it? 
it's nothing. it's just...a toy. 
everything's fine. 
let's get you back in bed. 
how did this get included in my order? 
well, it wasn't in your order, 'cause we don't sell those things. 
ooh, does that have a remote? 
maybe i should get one of those for ned. 
well, you were the only delivery, the only person in the house yesterday. 
so now what happened? 
i-i...i don't know what happened. 
i came downstairs,  the box was open, and this thing was flyin' around. 
have you been having a lot of weird things happen lately? 
yeah, i guess so. 
has anyone around you died recently? 
my stepfather died 2 years ago. 
 how old was he? 
 89. 
nope, not him. 
what, are you saying that... 
wait a minute,  bruce spence a guy i worked with once, and he died in a plane crash. 
 wait... 
 excuse me? 
what does that have to do with anything? 
oh, hi. i'm so sorry. we're just really busy. 
can you give me a day? 
i'll call you tomorrow, ok? 
'cause i really think that i can help you. 
i'm sorry. 
hi. all righ here is what i found in the back. 
honey, i didn't even know you were home. 
sorry, i just got in. 
before i left, we got a huge delivery that i had to inventory. 
come on,  come on up to bed. 
i will. i just have to nail down 
something first--ooh! 
here it is. 
bruce spencer was c.e.o. of 
the struggling barnes & stowe properties company. 
he was bought out by the company william taylor works for, and he died in a plane crash. 
all right,  that's tragic,  but relevant how? 
well, it says here that spencer had hit on hard times,  since the sale of his company. 
he felt cheated. company was overvalued. 
he ended up losing his house and pretty much all of his money. 
well, good. 
so he's the who's haunting william taylor. 
case closed,  time to come up. 
but he doesn't really look like my ghost. 
melinda, you're running yourself ragged. 
you gotta get some rest. 
there's nothing here that can't wait till tomorrow. 
 you're right. 
 all right. 
pack up,  and i'll be up in a second. 
 jim? 
 ready and waiting. 
are you bruce spencer,  by any chance? 
no, i'm not bruce...whoever. 
then who? 
come on, who do you think? 
no way. 
yep. i'm santa claus. 
*** you somethin'. 
i don't understand why you can see me. 
usually only kids can. 
 well, because i can see  hold on,  wait for the question. 
what i need to know is, are you here to help me, or are you just going to get in my way? 
let's talk about you first. 
why do you think you're santa claus? 
 why do you think you're you? 
 because i am? 
there you go. 
ok, um, maybe you're confused. 
do you see a light? 
do you need to cross over? 
heh, no. what i need to do is all around me. 
why are you trying to hurt william? 
i'm not hurting william. 
i'm helping riley. 
i got a letter from him. 
i've been helping kids for as long as i can remember. 
"dear santa, please, i just want my father back for christmas." 
i don't understand. 
and you tell me i'm confused. 
that guy william is totally disconnecting from his kid. 
i'm trying to get him to pay attention before it's too late. 
every time he gives his kid the bum's rush, i try to give him a little correction. 
i need to know,  am i gonna have a problem with you? 
yes. you need to leave them alone right now. 
they're dealing with enough. 
so it's get in my way. 
i thought so. 
you told santa he was confused? 
i guess i know which list you're going on. 
this guy is convinced he's santa claus. 
good! i'm glad,  i hope he is. 
you know why? 
i have a bone to pick with santa claus. 
1982, i asked for a video game. 
you know what i got instead? sensible shoes. 
will you please focus? 
i need to figure out who this guy is, so i can help him with his delusion. 
look, you've dealt with spirits like this before. 
remember, you had that one girl ghost who thought she was bloody mary. 
true, but she had specific reasons for taking on a persona, and specific people that she wanted to haunt. 
well, what's the difference between that and this guy? 
for all we know this guy,  the way that he died and something that happened in his life actually made him think he was santa. 
yeah, but what? i mean, 
what is his attachment to william and riley? 
i mean, riley writes a letter wanting his dad back, but it's his mom who's left the house. 
you're being too literal. 
this kid feels the distance. 
he misses his dad,  he's confused. 
what he wants back is his family. 
so... 
the santa ghost is gonna try to electrocute and terrorize william? 
it's not very jolly of him, is it? 
you've really been no help  all. 
all right, look,  i'll look up santa claus ghosts and christmas items on the computer. 
just, what else do you want from me? 
are you coming to my dinner christmas eve? 
 yeah, no. too busy. 
 with what? 
christmas eve stuff. you wouldn't understand. 
you know what? be at the house at 7:00, ok? 
or i'll kick your christmas butt. 
ah, charlie brown would be proud. 
turn right in 100 ft. 
yeah, the selma people get it friday. 
ok, right, right. not what i'm playing. 
yeah, i should be almost there. 
i have the documents ready. 
turn left in 50 feet. 
except that... 
 turn left now. 
 wait. 
turn rig,  turn left. 
something's messed up. my g is 
turn right now. 
i'm nowhere near whe we're supposed to be meeting. 
look, i need to call you ck, there's i need to pay attention here. 
turn left in 100 feet. 
turn left in 50 feet. 
*** *** your route guidance is now complete. 
it's just that-- i don't know, you seem to have a handle on all these weird things that are happening. 
well, maybe they'll put that on my gravestone. 
"melinda gordon,  who had a handle on weird things." 
so the car just led you there? 
yeah, yeah, i was supposed to be at a business meeting a half hour ago. 
everything went foggy, and then my gps led me straight to village java. 
where i see my wife with another man. 
um, i had a visit... last night 
from the ghost that's haunting you. 
a ght? 
you're telling me i'm being haunted by a ghost and you can see it? 
yes. 
that might be one weird thing too far. 
look, i know it sounds,  but it's true. 
 is it bruce spencer? 
 no. 
well, who is it? 
let's just say that i don't exactly know yet. 
but maybe he's trying to get you and your wife back together. 
by letting me see her with another man? 
ok. maybe he's trying to show you 
how much you have to lose. 
jane's never had a problem showing me what i have to lose. 
meaning? 
that's why we split up. 
a few months ago,  i found out she'd had an affair. 
it was a long time ago,  but when i did the math, i realized that it was 9 months before riley was born. 
 so is riley  i don't know. 
i guess i don't know what to think. 
i raised him,  i've been his dad, but... 
i just don't know. 
the whole thing's just one big nightmare. 
i'm sorry. 
i know what you see when you look at me. 
just some corporate guy who's all about work and making money. 
but i believed in things. 
i believed in jane.like i never 
you were brought to that cafe for a reason. 
go talk to her. 
jane. 
what are you doing here? 
i don't know. 
i...saw you with that guy. 
oh, really? 
well, where the hell were you this morning? 
i called you 3 times. 
we had a court hearing, remember? 
i know, i just... 
i couldn't face it. 
that guy was my lawyer. 
i'm sorry. we can reschedule it. 
the judge ruled r me, will. 
i'm taking the job in philly. 
and i'm king riley with me. 
look, it's close. 
you can still visit on weekends if you want. 
but you know you've been pulling away from riley because 'cause he may not be mine. 
it's excruciating to watch. 
all he wants is his dad,  and you treat him like he's a stranger all of a sudden. 
can't you see how that makes him feel? 
look, i'm just trying to get through this. 
you think i want to feel the way i'm feeling? 
i don't know how to turn it off. 
 you just ruined everything. 
 i know what i did, will. 
i would change it if i could. 
but we can't make riley suffer for it. 
i can't believe you actually did a test for paternity. 
if you don't like the results, what are you gonna do? 
i'd rather have riley think his dad's not present because of the distance in miles. 
not because of the distance in your heart. 
you're not trying to get them back together. 
you're trying  to tear them apart. 
why would santa do a thing like that? 
you should ** 's like he was rooting for william and jane to fight. 
doesn't that all have to do with him showing william what he has to lose? 
i don't think so. 
there's something else going on here. 
hey, wait a minute, didn't you tell me that jane had an affair? 
now what if that guy died, and he's haunting them both? 
i thought about that, but the age doesn't really match up. 
although it could have been a may-december thing, so it's worth checking out. 
gravy dish. 
honey, maybe we should just skip this holiday dinner. 
i mean, it's 2 days away. 
i have to work a double no! we are not canceling. 
we are not going to break tradition, ok? 
it's about being organized. 
look, table's set,  i'm ahead of the game. 
you know what? christmas is a few days away, 
and there's been a noticeable lack of christmas gift hints. what gives? 
i have everything i want right here. 
uh-huh. ok. come on,  name one thing. just one. 
world peace. 
ok, this ghost to cross over, which is why i have to find out if santa is jane's lover. 
yeah. 
 hang the garland. 
 right. 
i'm sorry about all that drama last night. 
tough situation,  i understand. 
how's riley doing with all this? 
he's sad, wishes he could spend more time with his mother, but he still seems like a happy kid. 
he told me that his mom's coming back and you guys are going to move to florida. 
yeah, well, sometimes that kid is just in his own little world. 
i know i don't need to tell you this, but kids are really sensitive. 
sometimes they can see things that we don't, they feel things that we don't. 
i'm just trying to get some clarity. 
i need to know if i'm his father or not. 
 aren't there tests that can be done? 
 i've done the tests, but i haven't got the results yet. 
so until then,  he feels your distance. 
is that why you left me that message to me aren't we both too busy for psychology lessons? 
i'm just trying to help you. 
the man that your wife... 
slept with? 
do you know if he's still alive? 
you think he might be the spirit or whatever? 
 it would be good to rule it out. 
 yeah, well,  you can rule it out. 
he's alive and well and living in san diego with some very nice memories. 
so what do you want for christmas? 
a puppy! oh! 
how about you? what do you want? 
teddy bear. 
i know who santa isn't. he is not bruce spencer, 
and he's not the man that william's wife is having an affair with. 
i haven't been able to find anything about deaths in her family. 
well, here's a novel idea maybe santa is santa. 
yeah, except for the fact that he's a myth. 
he's a myth,  but maybe also... 
maybe he's a ghost. 
all right,  hear me out. maybe santa's a ghost. 
think about it. only kids can see him, 
he can travel the world in a night, he can whisper  to parents what little timmy and sally want for christmas. 
you said it yourself at all the kids said that they saw santa. 
yeah, but that's probably because he believes it, and they can feel his energy. 
would santa make things explode or tear families apart, because that's what this ghost is doing to william. 
he would if he wanted to teach them a lesson. 
ok, all right,  follow me. 
all right, let's see,  there's a germanic tribe, they believe that santa claus is a reformed demon. 
he would slither down the chimney, and he'd see the kids in their beds and eat them all up. 
that's just nasty. 
it's not helping us at all, is it? 
no, it's really not,  and our ghost is not santa, ok? 
he's just a delusional spirit that has some kind of unresolved issues with william. 
i know, but he thinks he's santa. 
and considering the season,  it's delightful. 
just run with it. 
i don't have time. 
i don't have time, because the season is almost over and i'm not even ready for it to start. 
i need this ghost to cross over right now. 
if this guy isn't santa,  how did we wind up with the letter from riley to his father? 
good question. ghosts don't have mail boxes, 
they only have what they die with. 
well, that means this ghost must have died with the letter. 
and he's been hanging onto it because it meant so much to him. 
more than he knows. 
wait, you're leading now. 
how did that happen? i was just leading. 
no, no, no,  think about it. 
a letter from a child, probably before riley was even born. 
that ghost is attached to william. 
stepfather! how did i miss that? 
i've gotta go. you're a genius. 
tell me something i don't know. 
like what just happened, 'cause i don't know what just happened. 
thanks again,  and happy holidays. 
you know, we should take advantage of this lull and go grab a latte. you want one? 
no, i'good, thanks. 
did ned screw up a delivery? 
nope.i'm just looking for something. 
ok. 
William Taylor dear santa,  please i just want my father back for christmas. 
Taylor gotcha. 
hey! i saw you. in a christmas bulb! 
you're a smart kid, riley. 
santa likes smart kids. 
 you're santa? 
 in the flesh. pretty much. 
how come you're out here by yourself? 
 my dad forgets to pick me up. 
 what? that's terrible. 
sometimes  forgets it's his turn to have me. 
but he'll remember,  and he'll pick me up. 
he always does. 
that son of a listen, i just want you to know that i got your letter. 
letter? 
and i'm gonna take care of this for you. 
 what? 
 your dad. 
you're not gonna hurt him, are you? 
no, riley. 
i'm gonna make sure you get what you want. 
i just want him to like me again. 
you leave this with santa, ok? 
ok, santa. 
put on your seatbelt. 
bye, santa! 
i know who you are. 
and i really need to talk to you. 
i can help you. 
how can you help me when you don't believe in me? 
i know that you're really confused, and don't know why you're here. 
of course i do,  to give riley his christmas wish. 
i showed you the letter,  didn't i? 
it's a real heartbreaker. 
speaking of which,  how did you get it? 
you know,  i'm not sure. 
i just, uh,  well, it seems like i've always had it. 
you have always had it. 
especially since you died. 
 but the letter's not from riley. 
 what? 
that's william's letter. 
he wrote it when he was a little boy. 
he still does the funny thing with his "rs." 
wait, i oh. that doesn't make any sense. 
it does if you're william's father. 
and riley is really your grandson. 
what? 
how the hell do you figure that? 
well, at first,  when i was trying to figure out who was haunting william, i looked at all the family members. 
i'd forgotten that he said something about his stepfather, but i never even thought to look for a birth father. 
so? 
soi think that you're william's birth father. 
that's nuts. 
he gave you that letter before you died, and it broke your heart. 
that's why you haven't crossed over. 
look, i know that you think you're santa claus, but you're not. 
you're just a lonely little boy's father who's come back to reconcile with him, and i can help you do that. 
you are so on my bad list. 
 please, ok? let's just 
 no, no, no. 
i am santa claus. 
and this is why only kids can see me. 
adults have lost their ability to believe! 
you would be amazed at some of the things i believe. 
i'm not gonna waste any more time on you. 
 get lost. 
 this is my place. 
oh. yeah, well... 
you're not santa claus. 
i guess i'm just going to have to make you believe. 
william **holiday dinner for riley's sake. 
bless his heart. 
i feel like i've been cooking all week. 
is everything all right? 
i'm not sure. 
 could i ask you a personal question? 
 ok. 
 your husband was william's stepfather, right? 
 yes. 
so william's birth father was your first husband? 
what's this about? 
you know that weird things have been happening to william. 
i think it has something to do with his father. 
 and this has what to do with you? 
 nothing. 
everything. look,  if you could just trust me, 
i really think that i could help william, and riley, too. 
well, i don't see how. 
it's really pretty simple. 
my first husnd abandoned us when william was 5. 
I'm so sorry. 
 what was his name? 
 alan silver. 
5 years later,  i remarried. 
that's why william's last name is taylor. 
alan and i weren't right from the start. 
i think having a family just made him feel trapped. 
so we got untrapped. 
that must have been really hard on you and william. 
oh, he asked about his dad all the time. 
where was he,  why wasn't he with us, so i, uh... 
i created a myth about alan. 
told william his father did important work all over the world. 
he used to try and track where his father was on a map. 
he was so sure he was going to come home to us someday. 
the lie just got bigger and bigger, and i didn't know where to stop. 
the truth would have crushed him. 
christmas... was the hardest time. 
i used to wrap up a present and put it under the tree like it was from his dad. 
his little face would just light up when he'd open it. 
and then one year,  he just wouldn't open the present i told him was from his dad. 
and after that... 
he never asked about his father again. 
i'm sure that he stopped asking,  but... 
i bet he never stopped thinking of him. 
did william ever write a letter to his father? 
it wasn't a letter to his father. 
dear santa, please i just want my father back for christmas. 
it was like a knife through my heart. 
i felt like i had to do something, so i found out where alan lived and i sent him the letter. 
no response. 
i'm pretty sure he got it. 
and i bet it really touched him. 
just not enough,  i guess. 
here he is, alan silver. 
died of heart failure in '97. 
this guy made it big. he founded nature for life, 
those great organic coffees and teas. 
ooh, i love that stuff. 
yeah, and it says here he became a multimillionaire when they took the company public. 
the irony is,  he couldn't handle it. 
see, he just wanted to have this little hippie company, you know, and suddenly he was a rich capitalist. 
he had a nervous breakdown. 
you know,  i remember that guy. 
he gave away all his money. 
not only his money but his houses, cars. 
he gained weight,  grew a beard, and stopped cutting his hair. 
santa. 
that's got to be it, right? 
i mean, he lost his mind, started to think that he was  uh, this is gonna be a minute. 
 yeah, i can see that. 
you know what, i'm just gonna take care of the orders downstairs. 
ok. 
so, uh, why would you do that to my mother? 
make her remember all that crap from the past? 
i didn't mean to cause her any pain. 
i was just trying to help. 
it's like i told you, you have a ghost attached to you. 
yeah, so you said. 
it's your father. your real father. 
my real father? 
you mean the guy who raised me, who was always there for me? 
ok, it's your birth father. 
he got a letter from you, one that you wrote to santa claus when you were a little boy. 
look, it's a long story, but after he died,  he got really confused. 
and he thought that the letter was from riley, and then he thought that he was supposed to get you to spend more time with your son wait, wait,  wait a minute. 
why would he think that he was getting a letter from riley? 
because he thinks he's santa claus. 
because he doesn't know that he's your father. 
and why would he why would anyone think they're santa claus? 
because i think that...i don't know, 
i think he kind of went crazy before he died, you know? 
he gave up all of his money, his possessions, and i guess that made him think he was santa. 
this is great. 
so you're telling me that my dead father who never gave a damn about his family is now haunting me because he thinks he's santa claus? 
i really believe that he's haunting you because he wants to make things right. 
oh, plse. 
my father was a no-show,  my mother lied about it, and i think you're lying right now. 
so just stay the hell away from me. 
oh, and by the way,  merry christmas. ho ho ho. 
oh, no. 
it's true. i can see it now. 
i'm not who i thought i was. 
great. 
william, wait. 
 i know this is a lot to deal with. 
 you think? 
but it's christmas. 
can't you find a little forgiveness? 
look, you're talking to the wrong guy about christmas. 
there's only one christmas i remember. 
my mother was in the living room wrapping a gift. 
i watched her sign the card and put the present under the tree. 
when she left, i went to see what it said. 
dear william,  i'm in New Delhi,  i'm sorry i can't be with you,  but i love you always. 
daddy see, that's when i realized that it was all made up... 
that none of it was real. 
i stopped asking about my father after that. 
so the plane  did mean something. 
yeah, it meant it was all a lie. 
my father lied,  my mother lied. 
my wife lied. 
the whole idea about me being riley's father might be a lie. 
nobody thinks i'm worth telling the truth to. 
ok, you know what,  you can't look at it that way. 
look, i just want to know the truth. 
that's all i want. 
somebody to tell me just one true thing. 
william... 
that's your son. you do understand that? 
you had a nervous breakdown before you died. 
i think it was out of guilt. 
you gave everything away. 
and you didn't even know what you were making up for. 
i threw away my wife,  my son. 
it's not too le, alan. 
it's never too late. 
the christmas light just all of a sudden went out. 
i mean, it couldn't happen at a worse time. 
riley and jane are going to be here any minute, and dinner's almost ready. 
i'm so, so glad you made it home. 
is that... 
the test results. 
i had no idea you knew. 
i'm so sorry,  william. 
you should have told me the truth, ma. 
all those years,  all those hopes. 
look,  this isn't about blame. 
and whether you two believe it or not, it's not going to change the fact that alan is here. 
and he deserves a chance to try to make things right. 
how? how could he do that? 
tell will i'm sorry he had to deal with so many lies, but the truth 's looking for exists in one of those lies. 
he wants you to know that the truthou want is in one ofhose lies. 
your mother made up stories about me because she loved you. 
she knew that every boy needs a father, real or imagined. 
your mother made up those stories because she knew that you needed a father. 
she did it because she loved you. 
is my dad really here? 
your problem is, you're so busy lookin' for the lie, you can't see the truth. 
and he's telling you that you're so busy looking for the lie that you can't see the truth. 
your son... 
maybe he's yours,  maybe he's not. 
but you are his. 
you're the only dad he has. 
your son is the truth. 
he's your truth. 
your son is the only truth that matters. 
if you love your son right now, that's all that counts. 
if you love your wife right now, that's all that counts. 
the rest is just clutter. 
he's telling you to let go of the past. 
he wants you to listen to your heart. 
and if you love your son and you love your wife, then that's all that matters. 
the past, the rest,  it's just clutter. 
why'd you leave me, dad? 
where's the truth in that? 
because i didn't know what i had. 
because he didn't know what he had. 
daddy, grandma! look what we got! 
and mom sa i can open them all tonight! 
merry christmas, pal. 
merry christmas, daddy. 
dad, we found this by the door. 
that's just clutter, pal. doesn't mean a thing. 
well, i think dad has some presents under the tree for you. 
yeah, comen. 
jane, let me help you with those gifts. 
 you're back on my good list. 
  thanks, santa. 
grandma, which one should i open first? 
well, the good news is,  case is closed. 
now i just have to go make sure all the deliveries went out and then i will be home. 
did you get a chance to call everyone? 
yeah,  everyone understood. 
you were too busy to cook. 
oh, this just kills me. 
i mean, it doesn't even feel like christmas without friends, and all the christmas lights are ill out here. 
everything looks so glum. 
not at all. 
you look beautiful. 
what?! 
hey, here she comes. 
it's potluck,  i hope you don't mind. 
mind? this is the best gift ever. 
here you go. 
hang on a second. 
toast time. 
to my wife. 
to our friends. 
to everything we all have, and to all of us being together for this holiday. 
happy holidays. 
happy holidays. 
hey. 
 santa ghost cross over yet? 
 i don't think so. 
really? why not? 
because i think he really likes what he does. 
hey, you guys, look. 
Hey, by the way, thanks for keepin' me company. 
And miss a chance to ride out to the country? Sure. 
Maybe you and jim will move out here someday. 
No. Jim is a city boy. 
I think village square is about as country as he's gonna get. 
I never thought this house would sell. 
Yeah, you and me both. 
It's changed hands 4 times in 10 years. 
Well, you know what they say. 
It is the most haunted house... 
In driscoll county. 
I think it's not selling 'cause it's a money pit, Not because of the ghosts. 
Wow. This from you? 
Vacant houses usually aren't haunted. 
No? 
They need the energy of the living to feed off of. 
There are more ghosts in dentists' offices Than there are in an abandoned house like this. 
Oh. Well, that must explain 
my dentist's bad breath. 
Eww. 
Hey! My first guests. Come on in. 
Hey. Steve, i 
 I hope you don't mind i brought a friend. 
This is melinda rdon. Hi. 
I'm sorry. I just had 
hand-To-Hand combat with a saw, And the saw won. 
Ouch. Yeah. 
That word came in handy a lot today, Along with a few others, huh? 
Well, i was just stopping by to see how you were settling in, If you needed anything. 
Uh, yeah, a how-To book on power tools. 
This is my daughter. 
Hi. Marlo, pioneer girl. 
Do your horses need some feed? 
Wagon wheels need a-Fixin'? 
Marlo's just annoyed because the closest mall is 10 miles away. 
No, i'm annoyed because my friends are a hundred miles away. 
Anyway, i just have a couple papers I need you to sign from the title company. 
Yeah, sure. 
You know, i think i'm gonna clean up my thumb. 
I'd rather not sign in blood. 
Well, you're gonna, whether you want to or not. 
Hey, you work at an antique store, too, don't you? 
Uh, yeah. That's my boss. 
Oh. Hi. 
Hi. 
I found some really cool old board games. 
I was gonna keep some of them There's not a ton of entertainment here at the homestead. 
But i was wondering if you could tell me what they're worth? 
Sure. I could take a look at 'em. 
Oh, perfect. 
Have you ever heard of a game called, uh... 
Twister? 
You wanna come and check out the games? 
No. I'm good. I'm 
just gonna explore. 
Ok. 
Yep. This game. I'm not sure if 
all the pieces are here, though. 
This is a great game, yahtzee. 
You've never played? 
Never played it. 
Is someone here? 
Hello. 
Hello. 
I can help you. 
Who are you? 
One of them will die. 
Are you ok? 
Wonder when this tipped. 
Floor's rotted through underneath. 
Made a little river all through the ceiling. 
What a mess. 
I'm gonna see if marlo's finished cleanin' herself up, And i'll bring up some paper towels and... 
I'll bring her back up here. 
You know, for a minute there... 
You almost thought there was a ghost? 
No. 
Have to remember my rule. 
What rule? 
Rational explanation for almost everything. 
Right. 
Do you know why they moved? 
You know, steve lost his wife a few years back. 
He said that marlo was having A hard time in high school, And i guess it was just too painful To stay in the house. 
Oh, that is so sad. 
It's really hard on a kid when they lose a parent. 
Yeah. 
It can be hard on the other parent, too. 
So do you know what happened? 
Do you know why she died? 
No. He didn't say. 
I don't know if... 
Wait. I know that 
tone in your voice. 
You are asking for a reason. 
I saw something, someone. 
Are you saying that you saw a ghost in steve's house? 
In the garage, actually. 
What? It's just that 
I mean, there's always a damn ghost Everywhere you go. What is that? 
Ok, i wish they weren't always there, too, believe me. 
But it's not like i go out looking for them. 
Don't you? 
What? 
Look, i'm sorry. 
It's just that marlo and steve Have been through so much. 
They just need a clean start. 
They don't need to hear about ghosts And have their whole lives turned around. 
Yeah, but what if the ghost is marlo's mother? 
Melinda, they especially don't need to hear that. 
They need time to heal. 
There's obviously a A rational explanation. Well, 
it's not always that easy. 
I am just asking you to give them some peace. 
It's up to the ghost, not me. 
Fine. 
You're gonna do what you're gonna do. 
I just sometimes don't understand her. 
I mean, what's it gonna take, you know? 
After all she's seen, she can't just say, "Ok, i get it. There's ghosts. " 
Well, sometimes what people don't believe Is just as important to them as what they do believe, And some people feel better Thinkin' that there's nothin' after we die. 
You didn't have a hard time believing. 
Well, it was because i believed you. 
Also, i don't know... 
What? 
Come on. 
I always wanted to believe. 
I mean, i always wanted to believe that there was more. 
I mean, after my father died, I wanted to think that everything we do here Does not come to nothing. And then... 
There was melinda. 
So what do you think? 
Should i just stay out of it, Let the family live in peace? 
Hey, who says they're in peace? 
I think you can cross this ghost over quickly and quietly In, out, nobody gets hurt. 
Ha. Famous last words. 
Are you here? 
You scared me. 
What are you doing in my garage? 
I'm sorry. Um, it's 
just that the, uh The furniture, it's so interesting. 
Um, we could sell some of it for you if you wanted. 
I had a little something for marlo. 
That's ok. I'd like to give 
it to her myself, if i could. 
It's adorable. Thank you so much. 
It suits her. 
I have to keep her in here, 'Cause my dad's not crazy about cats. 
How's your dad doing? He seemed 
Moody? 
Right. 
He's been doin' pretty well since my mom died. 
What was her name? 
Liz. Short for lisbeth. 
She hated being called lisbeth. 
Must be hard for you, Moving and all, not knowing anyone. 
She got me. 
What? 
My mom. 
She-She got me. 
She was the only one. 
Well, i'm sure your father I know. 
But not like her. 
Now i don't think anybody ever will. 
Sometimes i think he blames me for what happened. 
What happened? 
Where's dora? 
I hope she didn't go in my dad's room. 
Hang on. 
Liz? 
What happened? 
The cat, it died. 
What did you do to her? 
I didn't do anything to her. 
I just found her like that. 
Might have been some rat poison or something. 
I'm sorry, honey. 
Steve, are you ok? 
Yeah. 
She sure did like that cat. 
Yeah? 
Hey. Steve. I'm so 
sorry to bug you, But i just thought i could walk you through these county tax... 
Rebate forms. 
You know, it's a great program, Especially if you plan on putting any money into the place. 
What's wrong with the place? 
Well, you know. I 
mean, whatever you do For improvements, things like that. 
I like the place just the way it is. 
Ok. Well, then, um, i could just 
Just forget it. 
If it makes life easier, he's not interested. 
Yeah, well, you're the expert on easy livin'. 
Never do today what you can put off till tomorrow, right? 
What are you saying? I'm lazy? 
You didn't think i was lazy When certain things had to be done to a certain person. 
I should have stopped you. 
That's easy to say now, But you had too much to gain, didn't you? 
As long as i was doing it, you weren't gonna stand in my way. 
You know, it looks like i came at a bad time, So i'm just gonna leave these over here. 
Bad time for what? 
Um, to sign the tax rebate form. 
It's ok. I can just leave it. 
If i sign it, will you get the hell out of here? 
Um, yeah. 
It was like they were 2 different people. 
It was so eerie. 
Like they were in a trance? 
Yeah, exactly. And 
they kept talking about Having done something to somebody, And marlo said that her dad had too much to gain to stop her. Weird. 
Could they have been talking about marlo's mother? 
Well, why would you think steve would have done something to the mother of his child? 
Because of this. 
"Liz sinclair, 36, of oak hills died "In a fatal fall from a hiking trail "In the northwest section of ryden state park. 
"Her hiking companions, husband steven sinclair, 37, "And daughter marlo, 15, were unharmed. 
"Sinclair was questioned late into the night "By the county sheriff and released the next morning. 
Officials would make no further comment. " 
Yeah. Well, obviously 
they let him go. 
Yeah, which only means they had no proof. 
I mean, it could explain why liz is haunting him. 
Then again, marlo did say that steve blames her. 
Maybe she's haunting marlo. 
Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on. 
Did you say anything The last time you were there about ghosts or hauntings? 
No. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah, of course i'm sure. Why? 
I don't know. Maybe it's like 
Power of suggestion, you know? 
They think they're haunted, So then they just start acting like it. 
Ok, i love you Like a sister, really, i do, But you are the most stubborn person I have met in my entire life. 
I mean, you will twist yourself up into a pretzel Trying to rationalize some I'm sorry, i'm just looking for a logical reason for them to Oh, you mean the believable reason, not the real reason, But the easy reason. 
Whatever makes you comfortable. 
Let me get this straight. 
Daddy and daughter move to the country to get away from it all. 
There's a ghost in the garage that predicts That one of them will be dead soon. 
The cat turns up somewhat less than alive, And daddy buries it like it's just another day of yardwork. 
And this morning... 
And this morning, delia goes over to the house And finds herself in the middle of who's afraid of virginia woolf? 
What are you doing? 
Oh. I'm, uh-I'm trying 
A radical new technique to my class lectures. 
What? Preparation. 
Ok, so what am i looking at with this ghost? 
You're looking at, uh... 
A little more jack nicholson, little less linda blair. 
Meaning? 
Meaning it's not like there's a demon taking over their bodies. 
It sounds like there's a spirit influencing them from the outside, Controlling their behavior from time to time. 
It's called "oppression. " 
You mean "possession. " 
No. I say what i mean. I 
mean what i say, damn it. 
I said, "oppression. " 
Ok, oppression. Sorry. 
Never heard of it. 
Basically it's when a spirit controls a body Without ever entering inside of it. 
It's a bit like hypnotic suggestion. 
In essence, it directs how it wants the body to behave, And what's really creepy is over time, The person begins to act more and more like that ghost. 
It's possession lite, if you will. 
It's all the bad manners with half the head-Spinning. 
Ok, so why not go full-On possession? 
Ah, possession, that's a tool used by demons, Spirits that never walked the earth in human form, Whereas oppression these are-These are used by earthbound spirits, Earthbound spirits that are very stubborn And will do whatever it takes to get what they want. 
Which is? 
That's for the ghost to know and for you to find out. 
Ok, so how do i get the ghost to stop, to leave them alone? 
That's hard to say. I'm not 
sure, but i do know this. 
You have to be careful, because an oppressive spirit They will really take advantage of any weakness, Any vulnerability that their host has A mental illness, emotional turmoil. 
Turmoil like, "i killed a loved one"? That kind of turmoil? 
Oh. Ok, i was thinking more 
like white slacks in november, But sure, that would work also. 
Steve? 
Hey. Uh, i-I'm sorry that 
i didn't call first. I just 
You play from your head, not your heart. 
That's why you lose. 
I don't always lose. 
Sometimes just let you win. 
Why? 
Mess with your head a little bit, False confidence  Things like that. 
Heh. You think i'm 
falsely confident? 
Why don't you make yourself useful and go get me a drink? 
Good idea. 
Liz? 
Stop it! 
You're not liz sinclair. Who are you? 
You see me, don't you? 
Leave them alone. 
Matt, we have more company. 
Whoa. It's scary when they 
look right at you like that. 
Marlo, look, i don't know if you can hear me, But you're being used. 
I- I know that you can't see them, but you- You can feel them. 
Steve, please listen to me, ok? 
You don't know what's happening. 
Both of you get out of this house right now! 
Steve. 
What did you do? 
My daughter. 
Where's my daughter? 
She right here. She's fine. 
She's goin' with you. 
Hey, stay with these 2 guys. 
They'll take care of you, all right? 
You're playing too rough. 
You're gonna break them like you broke the others. 
You're just a sore loser. 
No, i am not. 
It's just that these two are too perfect to lose. 
I mean, all that guilt, i can practically taste it. 
What the hell are you two doing? 
Sorry. It's a private game. 
Oh, is that what this is? You just 
play with them like they're toys? 
None of your business. Buh-Bye. 
Melinda. 
Is he gonna be all right? 
Zenorex prescribed to steven sinclair. 
Yeah, this is good news, actually. 
It's an antidepressant. 
He'd have to take a lot of these to be fatal. 
This guy just try to kill himself? 
His daughter put it in his drink. 
What? It wasn't really her, ok? 
There's 2 ghosts in the house, and they're trying to control them. 
Wait. There are 2 ghosts 
 What, they're possessed? 
It's called oppression. They lived 
here before. It's a long story. 
Wait. You always say houses 
aren't haunted, people Ok, just  All right. 
Well, do we call the cops? 
Not yet. As long as they're 
out of the house, they're safe, And they don't even remember what happened. 
I just can't let this little girl get taken away from her dad. 
All right. 
Ok, will you just keep an eye on him for me? 
I'll do what i can, But i think they're only gonna keep steven overnight. 
I have to figure out who these ghosts are and what they want. 
Right. 
Hey. Yeah? 
You call me if anything changes? 
You know it. 
It was a man and a woman. 
The woman is slightly older than him. 
It's not marlo's mother? 
No. I don't think they're 
connected to the family at all. 
They might be connected to the house. 
But i thought you said places aren't haunted, and people are. 
All right, shush. 
Hey, wait a minute. 
You got steve and marlo Out of the house. 
That's a positive thing. 
Except for the fact that marlo practically killed her father. 
Less positive, i admit. 
Look, these oppressive ghosts, they're stubborn. They're very powerful. 
Powerful enough to survive more than one owner, Which is probably why the house is haunted, and not the people. 
Touch�. All right. 
So you said that these ghosts are treating it all like it's some kind of a game? 
Yeah. Like a contest. 
What is it, the newlydead game? 
That was good. I just made that up. 
All right, what's the point of their game, Last ghost out of the house wins? 
Last man standing. Steve and 
marlo are the game pieces. 
Why don't you just figure out what their names are, Figure out how to play, and beat them at their own game And get them to cross over? 
Don't make it sound so easy. 
Maybe i already have a name. 
You said that steve signed a tax form-Sorry. 
He did? Oh, there you are. 
When you went down there. Can i see it? 
Uh, why? Why-Why do you need to? 
Please. I just need to see it. 
Is it something about his handwriting? 
Okget ready to think of a rational reason. 
For what? 
Why steve sinclair signed his name as "matthew sembrook. " 
You know, i don't get it. 
Why would steve sign somebody else's name? 
Because that's who he thinks he is. 
Here. Look. 
"Matthew sembrook with father erwin and mother vivian. " 
Mother? She looks 10 
years older than him. 
Matt is erwin's son from a previous marriage. 
He was vivian's stepson. 
It says here that matthew and vivian died of natural gas poisoning. 
What happened to erwin sembrook? Where's he? 
Dead, 6 months before. 
Apparently, erwin died in an accident shortly after marrying vivian, So mother and son inherited the house and the fortune. 
So you're saying that these two, Matthew and vivian, are haunting the sinclairs? 
Not only haunting them, but controlling them, Which i'm sure is what they did with everyone else who lived in that house. 
Well, their death, what happened? 
Was it an accident, a suicide? 
What does the article say? 
Well, it says here that there are unanswered questions. 
Well, is there something i can do to help? 
Would you really want to? 
Look. You're right. 
I don't know why, But there is just some default switch that goes off inside my head, And it always resets to "that can't be. " 
Well, maybe it can be. 
Ok. 
Maybe it can. 
I just don't want to feel like i'm hurting you Every time that i question it. 
It has nothing to do with hurting me. 
I just hate to see you so closed off. 
I mean, there are tons of things in life that we take on faith, That we can't see. Why can't 
you do that with spirits? 
I can. 
I will. 
I'm gonna try. 
But if i can't I'm sorry. 
Jim. 
Mel, steve's being released from the hospital tonight. 
He's signing himself out, goin' home. 
I know who you are. 
Matthew and vivian sembrook. 
You like to play games? 
So do i. 
Let's see how you do with someone you don't control. 
Not so easy keeping up the energy When the sinclairs are gone, is it? 
Oh, you'll do. 
You both need to cross over. 
No, thanks. We're good here. 
Ok. Then i'll play you for it. 
For what? 
A crossover. 
20 questions. 
If i can tell you what happened when you lived here, Then you have to cross over. 
And if you don't guess? 
I'll never bother you again. 
Really? That is so stupid. 
You don't bothers at all. 
You mean nothing to us. 
I like it. 
Let's do it. 
What were you doing when i first saw you in the garage? 
I never saw you in the garage. 
Are you sure you want to count that as a question? 
Your late huand died in this house, didn't he? 
Yes. 
And you were both here that night? 
Yes. 
And you feel guilty about what happened? 
Just like you feel guilty about a few things, don't you? 
About someone in particular, maybe? 
I'm asking the questions. 
That's right, andrea, you are. 
What? 
I'm sorry. Did i call you 
by someone else's name? 
Did you kill your husband? 
You want to know what happened that night? 
Come. 
Vivian, mathew, are you up ther? 
How can you do this? 
He's my son! 
He's not my son. 
He does something you never do, Pays attention to me. 
Vivian, wait. 
And you! What kind 
of a man are you? 
A man raised by you. 
Don't you turn your back on me! 
Look, it was an accident. 
Ok, i just saw it. 
He missed a step, So you don't have to blame yourself. 
You guys can forgive each other. 
And your dad, he's gonna be in the light, ok? 
He'll forgive you. 
Wow. She did it. 
She wins the game. 
So now you can cross over And you can leave the sinclairs alone. 
Wait. There was one more thing. 
Why? 
Why? 
Stop it! 
You killed him. 
Yeah, sorry. It's just that... 
Well, we're really not very nice people. 
Melinda, what-What are you still doing here? 
I'll explain later, ok, but we have to get out ofere. 
Now, you can just come a  And stay with me, But you have to get out of this house right now. 
Ok, let's go. 
Ok. 
Don't be a sore loser. 
And leave us the hell alone. 
Steve, please don't do this. 
Who are you? 
Are you liz sinclair? 
Are matt and vivian stopping you from going in the house? 
I'm too weak. 
They're too strong for me. 
They're only strong 'cause they've spent years Feeding off of other people's fear, Playing their little games. 
Did steve cause your death? 
Yes. 
But he had to. 
Why? 
The alternative would have been even worse. 
I think that steve's guilt Is what's allowing matt and vivian to have so much power over them. 
It's not just steve's guilt. 
What? 
It's marlo, too. 
He will always blame you. 
Every time he looks at you, he sees his dead wife. 
Do you know what that does to him? 
There's really only one way to end this, All this pain, all this anger. 
You know what it is. 
You know what you have to do For your own protection. 
You know what you have to do To make sure you both get peace. 
It's the best thing for both of you. 
It only hurts for a second. You'll barely know, 
And then you'll both finally have some peace. 
Don't listen to her. 
Ok, this is not you. 
This is a ghost that's making you feel these things. 
What? 
This is what you do, isn't it? 
You just play your story over and over again, Except it's a new person each te, But your real story Is that you were so guilty about killing your husband That you killed yourselves. 
Looks and brains. I'm impressed. 
The newspapers keep saying that it's-It's poisoning from natural gas. 
It's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? 
A bit. 
And it wasn't about guilt either. 
The thing is matt and i always thought we were a perfect match, Because neither one of us had a shred of conscience. 
Oh, it was just delicious. 
The problem is that when you realize the man you love is as dangerous as you are... 
Let's just say it's not a trust builder. 
Attraction turns to suspicion. 
There was a lot of money at stake. 
Erwin had left us both very well off. 
So i started to wonder Was matthew's devotion real, Or did he really want all that money to himself, And what would he be willing to do? 
He already knew what i was willing to do, And i'm sure he was having the same thoughts about me. 
Which is why i decided That the best thing for our relationship Was for matt to have a tragic, careless accident. 
Control freak that i am, i wanted to make sure that he fell asleep, As it were, before i left the house. 
He was always so restless. 
Imagine my surprise when i fell asleep before he did. 
Very sneaky stuff, natural gas. 
Turns out i was much more sensitive to it than he was. 
Of course, matt followed soon after. 
Then we woke up, and we were dead, And we've been here having a blast ever since. 
What? What is going on? 
I'm gonna get you out of this house right now. 
We'll get your father. 
I vote for my guy. He's 
gonna go all the way. 
You should have behaved. 
What are you going to do? 
Don't count my girl out. 
Both of you just stop it. 
This is family business. 
You should have left us alone. 
Too late now. 
Steve, please stop, ok? 
I've seen your wife. 
I've seen her spirit. 
My wife is dead. 
You should know. 
You killed her. Me? 
If it wasn't for you, she'd still be alive. 
You let go! 
You didn't listen to me! 
Now that's entertainment. 
Come on. Come on. 
What's happening? 
Just trust me. I'm 
taking you to your mother. 
Wait, waitwait! 
What are you-What are you saying about my mom? 
Tell her i'm sorry that it's been so hard on them. 
Your mom is here with us. 
I can see her. 
Tell her i miss our nightly ritual Of brushing each other's hair, Her beautiful hair that she got from her grandmother. 
She misses brushing each other's hair. 
Dad, uh, she says mom's here, Her-Her spirit or-Or ghost or something, And she wants to help. 
What-What are you talking about? 
That shirt he's wearing is my favorite, Because he wore it when marlo was born. 
She remembers your shirt. 
You were wearing it the day that marlo was born. 
She said that? 
She's really here? 
They have to stop punishing themselves. 
She wants you to stop punishing each other. 
I'm so sorry, mom. 
Dad's right. If it wasn't for me, i 
 No. 
It's all my fault, and No. It was me. 
It was me. 
I made the decision. It was me. 
What happened that day? 
We were so tired. 
We'd been on that trail all day. 
Watch my moves. 
Oh. Hey, look! 
It happened so fast. 
Aah! Liz! 
No! 
One second, she was next to me. 
The next, she was hanging off a cliff. 
I was trying to pull her up, but i couldn't get any traction. 
Mom! No! 
Dad! Stay there! 
And that's when it all fell apart. 
I knew i couldn't stop marlo. 
How can you stop a child from trying to save her mother? 
Mom! Aah! 
Marlo was falling. 
She was gonna die. 
I couldn't get liz back on the ledge. 
I thought there was only one way to save her. 
I let go of liz, And i grabbed ahold of marlo. 
Mom! Liz! 
I'm so sorry. 
I should have tried to save you both. 
No. No, he couldn't. 
He did what i wanted him to do, The only thing that he could do. 
You did everything that she wanted you to do. 
You saved marlo. 
And i know you were trying to save me. 
She risked her life for me. 
She doesn't blame you. 
She was really proud of you. 
I'm so sorry, mom. 
I don't know how to do any of this without you. 
You will always have me with you in your heart, But most importantly, you have each other. 
They've gotta stop punishing themselves. 
Please tell them that we'll always be a family, And they have to take care of each other. 
I will. 
I have to go now. 
She crossed over. 
Is she gonna be ok? 
She was smiling, at peace. 
She's always gonna be in your heart. 
How come i don't feel anything bad when i go inside now? 
They can't feed off your guilt anymore. They're weak. 
How can i sell this house to somebody knowing what i know? 
I'll come back, cross them over. 
Don't worry about it. You 
two just get a fresh start. 
I cannot thank you enough. 
Me, too. 
Things'll get better now. You'll see. 
Would you mind checking marlo into the hotel? 
I just need to grab a few more things. 
Sure. Come on. 
Only one way to be sure things'll get better. 
Well played. 
My dad! 
Fresh start. 
Hi, mel. 
Jim, you'd better get the fire department to the sinclair house. 
Steve did the only thing he thought he could do. 
What will we do? 
What if nobody else comes? 
This is our home, the-The place where we met. 
We can't leave. 
Don't worry. Somebody always comes. 
They'll build. 
They'll buy and sell. 
All we have to do is wait. 
What do we do in the meantime? 
How 'bout a game? 
20 questions? 
You're on. 
Ok. Oh, i got a good one. 
Hope? 
The child is Hope? 
I�m sorry.  I never meant to lie. 
Xena, I couldn�t kill her. 
She�s my daughter. 
You�re a mother, you know this! 
I had to save her. 
Maybe it�s not too late. 
She�s young. 
Poison�ll kill her if her powers aren�t mature. 
Poison? 
Xena, she is my child! 
She is not a child! 
She is a body, a vessel, an instrument for evil. 
That is all! 
I�m ready!  I�m ready!  I�m ready! 
I�m ready! 
Gabrielle?  Hey, you OK? 
I can�t. 
What�s the matter?  Huh? 
I can�t do this. 
OK.  Uh, then, then, we won�t. 
We don�t have to.  Uh, 
never again. 
What are you talking about? 
I have to go. 
Go?  Go where? 
Hey, Xena told us to meet her near the temple of Mnemosyne. 
I don�t think it�s such a great idea to be walking around these, wait. 
Wait!  Hey!  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey, 
Look, OK, I, I don�t know what�s up. 
But I know something�s wrong. 
Maybe I can help you. 
No one can help. 
It�s my memories. 
I can�t shake them. 
I, I can�t sleep. 
I can�t eat. 
It�s like I�m paying for something, but I don�t know what it is. 
I have to find the answer. 
OK, OK, OK, we�ll- we�ll, meet up with Xena later, OK? 
Joxer, I have to do this alone. 
Wait here. 
Wait!  How long? 
I don�t know. 
That�s long enough. 
Is this the temple of Mnemosyne? 
Was I supposed to bring something? 
An offering? 
Hello. 
Wait. 
Sorry, do I know you? 
No.  I�m not from here. 
Am I? 
Excuse me? 
Wait, did you see her? 
You saw the Priestess of Mnemosyne, didn�t you? 
And your memories The Priestess will see you now. 
Will I end up like her? 
You have questions that need to be answered? 
Yes. 
I have pain, incredible pain. 
I want it to end. 
Erasing the pain of memory comes with a price. 
Are you prepared to lose everything you�ve ever known? 
Yes, I�m prepared. 
Enter. 
Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. 
You are haunted by memories, images from your past. 
You want to understand why they still haunt you. 
How did you know that? 
When you entered the temple, your memories became  Mnemosyne�s, became mine. 
We know more about you than you know about yourself. 
But then, that is why you�re here, to find that part out about you, that you don�t know. 
Can you help me? 
Perhaps. 
Your memories are like a body of water. 
Some flow deep, out of your reach. 
Others flow easily on the surface. 
Ah, this one�s  yours. 
You could open a pottery shop. 
Fill the bowl from the jug. 
There is one bowl filled for every person who comes to us. 
Filled with what? 
Memories, answers. 
Gabrielle, you�re about to take a journey through your memories. 
Like a dreamscape? 
Do not confuse dreams with memories. 
Your memory has three rivers. 
To find the answer to your pain, you must cross them all. 
Once you find the answer, you will have to decide. 
Decide what? 
On whether to keep your past or forever lose it. 
This bowl will hold everything you know. 
If it is ever emptied, so goes your memory. 
Do you understand the risk? 
I�ve decided. 
I need to know. 
Tough guys, eh? 
Well, my friend�s in there, and I wanna see her! 
You can see her when she comes out. 
She is with the Priestess of Mnemosyne, now. 
Oh, yeah? 
Well, um, I got news for ya. 
I�ll be back. 
You�re both on my list. 
And I�m not taking any names! 
Gabrielle? 
Gabriellllle! 
Ha!  Now I will destroy you 
with the ultimate power! 
Gabrielle! 
She is on her journey, Joxer. 
That Gabrielle is just an empty shell, with no realization of her past. 
Get away from her. 
How�d you know my name? 
I have your memories, ow. 
Whatever. 
I�m gettin� her out of here. 
Don�t try and stop me. 
Your feelings give you away. 
If you love her, allow her the chance to lose the pain she carries. 
It�s in her memory. 
Yeah? Well, I can make her forget. 
I�m a very forgettable person! 
I wouldn�t do that if I were you. 
What are you doing here? 
You don�t know? 
Oh, yeah, the memory thing, right? 
Got a problem up here? 
Bad thoughts keeping you up nights? 
Believe it or not, I�m here to protect you. 
Remember when you, stole my powers with that whole, scroll business? 
I know, call me a big softie, but, I decided I like you after all. 
Maybe you�re here for your own selfish reasons. 
Aren�t you? 
It�s called the �River of Wailing.� 
And just remember, I did warn you. 
This isn�t so bad, Ares. 
�River of Wailing,� is it? 
Ah!   Look out! 
Gabrielle! 
I thought you were different from her. 
I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose. 
You�re not going to die, Crassus. 
I said I�d switch you. 
if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that. 
Don�t rely on that. 
Most of Rome doesn�t know what I look like, let alone the prison guards. 
You will with this, your imperial ring. 
It identifies you in every province. 
Show this to the guards once we�re gone. 
I�m, sorry about what I said. 
Wait.  What�re you, ? 
I�m not Vercinix! 
I�m Crassus! 
I�m not Vercinix! 
I�m Crassus! 
you, my ring!  My imperial ring! 
Tell them who I am! 
Yeah! 
Caesar!  No! 
Caesar! 
�The River of Woe.� 
You know? 
It isn�t any better than the one you just went through. 
Think about it. 
I have. 
The last one took me by suprise, but, I�m ready for this. 
I hope so. 
This river runs deep. 
Oh.  OK.  Wait here. 
These are your scrolls. 
You wrote them. 
This is your bag. 
This, is your staff. 
Sound familiar now? 
Sorry, Jerkster. 
Joxer. 
Joxer? 
Nothing seems familiar, In fact, I don�t even know what familiar feels like. 
High priestess was right, gates are open, but no one�s stormin� the castle. 
Now, I, am going to, teach you about yourself. 
I�m going to give  you your memories back. 
OK?  But, just the good ones, 
none of the painful ones. 
That�s what you wanted, isn�t it? 
I don�t know. 
Sit down. 
Sit!  Sit! 
I�ll fix this right now. 
OK.  Good! 
The first one, �Sins of the Past.� 
�It was a, warm day in,Poteidaia when the bard awoke. 
As she, moved softly through the, Excuse me. 
Y-yeah? 
What�s a Poteidaia? 
So, found a bit of an ice bridge. 
Good, very good. 
If I can, if I can just stay above the water, it can�t hurt me. 
interesting. 
There�s an analogy here, of course, the water representing our torments, the ice, the thin layer of control we�d like to believe that we have over it. 
Shut up! 
But it�s a false confidence if the ice should suddenly develop a, Help me. 
Not my job, my dear. 
Well, not yet, anyway. 
I�m sorry, Xena. 
I couldn�t let you do this. 
Is the green dragon a person? 
Yes. 
Which person? 
The one I�m gonna kill. 
So, you have nothing to say in your defense,Xena. 
Xena. 
So be it. 
Tomorow, at dawn, you�ll experience this life for the last time. 
You owe someone so much, that you would just throw away these last few years. 
Yes. 
Yah!  Say it! 
Xena, if you promise them, they will banish you. 
Please, we can ride away from this. 
Prepared for that, were you? 
I can�t continue.  I-it�s too much. 
That�s the spirit.  Let it go! 
I mean, what does it matter? 
Pain is just nature�s way of saying, �Hey! 
You�re alive.�  Accept it. 
Who needs the true? 
I can go back.  I have the answer. 
Do you, now? 
Yes. 
I thought that I�d never come to terms, with my mistakes. 
But I did, when I visited Xena, in Ming T�ien�s prison. 
Can we talk? 
Of course not. 
I betrayed you. 
The pathetic thing is, I thought I was saving you. 
My reverence for life kept a brutal tyrant in power, and led to my best friend�s execution. 
I know you hate me, Xena, no more than I hate myself. 
Scratch my nose, will you? 
Come on. 
You see? 
Now I know. 
Is this something you, just realized? 
Yes.  I, I have come to terms with it. 
I just didn�t realize it. 
It has to be the answer- swer, right? 
You, are such a smart little girl. 
That�s what I like about you. 
Now go, back through the �River of Woe�, toward home. 
Don�t worry. 
If anything happens, I�ll be here to save you. 
That is, if it doesn�t bother you owing a favor to the god of war. 
I was right. 
I can�t see my memories anymore. 
No! 
What is this?! 
Stop it! 
No! 
I guess you were wrong. 
Nice try, though. 
You, said you�d, save me. 
No, no.  What I said was, 
�I would be here to save you, and I am. 
I can�t go back. 
I can�t go forward. 
I don�t know what to do. 
Well, seems to me the answer�s obvious. 
You could stay here for all eternity or, death. 
Just tryin� to help. 
It�s very strange. 
With every story you tell me, this thing I�m wearing gets smaller. 
Is it enchanted? 
Uh, yeah.  They, uh, they are.  It is. 
Gotta, be around here, somewhere. 
I know sh, you wrote about it. 
Jerkster, do I live around here? 
It�s Joxer, not Jerkster. 
It�s Joxer.  And no, you don�t. 
You, wander around, with, me and Xena, doing good stuff, like, you know, the stuff I, told you about in the scrolls. 
I�m looking forward to meeting Xena. 
You think she�ll like me? 
Probably. 
Oh, Ok, I got it!  I got it. 
Come here, sit down. 
Are you going to sing that �Jerks, � that, �Joxer the Mighty� song, again?� 
I like that song. 
Are you kiddin� me? 
You hate it. 
I do? 
No, uh, you love it. 
Uh, but,this, is the story of Callisto. 
Callisto? 
Yeah. 
Do I like her? 
No, but, uh, I want you to hear when we first met. 
�this mus,� yeah, �Suddenly, there he was. 
He called himself, Joxer, a warrior.� 
Huh, well-termed phrase, I must say. 
�But a warrior like no other, so inept, so clumsy, s, � uh, so, cleverly disguised, as a bumbler, that, uh, no one suspected his true warrior nature. 
That�s nice. 
Yeah, yeah, it gets better, lots better. 
Then I realized, that�s, you talking, then I realized that I was completely taken by this handsome, mysterious, dark leader of men. 
I�m in love with you? 
Yes.  Yes, you are. 
I think I knew that. 
Go on. 
So, a thousand men attacked Joxer. 
He battle them bravely, one by one. 
I�m here, Ares. 
So, you are.  I wondered. 
I have to go on. 
The priestess said the answer�s on the other side. 
What she told you means nothing. 
If you survive, the answer might be there. 
Is it all worth it? 
Is the quest for knowledge worth all this pain? 
Yes.  It has to be. 
Otherwise, what�s the point of living? 
Point, there is no point to living. 
Don�t you get it, Gabrielle? 
Maybe, that�s the source of all your pain, all you�ve been through with Xena, all she�s put you through. 
Maybe, you finally realized it all adds up to a big, fat zero. 
You�re wrong, not with Xena. 
We were lost, once. 
But Solon, he took us to Illusia to give us one more chance. 
We found ourselves. 
Hatred It begins very small, Seems like nothing much at all. 
Just a germ, just a speck, just a grain. 
But the seed has been sewn, And before you know it's grown, It has spread through your life like a stain. 
And its power will strangle Your love and your joy. 
And its hunger consumes, For it lives to destroy! 
Hatred, Gabrielle, that's what we're fighting hatred. 
Hate is the star; It becomes who you are. 
Not the hated but the hater, Has a torment that's greater. 
It will eat you alive, Consume you and spit you out. 
Hate's gonna win, That there's no doubt about! 
Hate doesn't care Who you are! 
Hate is the star! 
Learning hate is an art. 
Even people who are smart Can be caught, can be crushed, can be creamed. 
It has swallowed you whole. 
Did you think you're in control? 
Hate you thought, hate you spoke, hate you dreamed. 
All your hate gave me substance, Your lives are undone. 
It's your eve of destruction, Your hatred has won! 
No! 
Gabrielle! 
I never dreamed that we'd be Distanced by a hate, That all the trust we had would go. 
How could I hate you? 
How could it come to pass, This awful twist of fate? 
How could I hurt you? 
This madness can't be so, I can't believe it. 
I never dreamed That any barriers could rise. 
Or that I'd ever see The stranger in your eyes. 
Our hearts were hurting both the same. 
The hurt was tearing up our souls. 
The fury in us made us blind. 
We could not see beyond the pain. 
If we can turn again to love. 
If we can heal these open wounds. 
We'll leave this hatred far behind. 
So not a trace of hate remains. 
and We'll overcome our damaged past! 
And we'll grow stronger side by side! 
To stand together through the storms! 
We're safe 'cause love will be our guide! 
It was worth it. 
Then why are you still here? 
Answer me. 
Gabrielle, I am catching a ship here that will carry me close to the kingdom of Ch�in. 
If there was ever a time to turn back, it�s now. 
I understand. 
You owe someone so much, that you would just throw away these last few years. 
Yes. 
You!   Noooooooo! 
Noooooooooo!  Nooooooooo! 
Yes, now you know. 
But your strength is gone. 
The truth you looked for, it�s done you no good. 
You�re wrong!  Wrong!  Wrong! 
Wrong!  Wrong!  Wrong! 
You aren�t Ares. 
You aren�t a god! 
You�re from within me. 
You�re that part of me who wants to hide the truth. 
Call me what you will, your guilt, your denial. 
You can�t defeat me. 
You�ll only die trying. 
That�s why you�re here as Ares. 
Yeah, Ares is the key. 
But he�s only half the answer. 
I know, it�s because of what I did. 
It�s because of why I did it. 
Well, there she goes without you. 
Kind of makes you feel second best, doesn�t it? 
Leave me alone, Ares. 
Xena has her own decisions to make. 
Really? 
Sounds more like an obligation to me. 
Yeah, Lao Ma must be important, all right. 
Xena would never do anything like this for you. 
Funny, isn�t it? 
You give up your family, your home, your blood innocence, your daughter, all because of Xena. 
And yet it�s, like nothing compared to the debt she owes this woman. 
Of course, you could always stop her. 
I could never get to Ch�in fast enough. 
Xena�s sure to take the fastest route. 
That is true. 
You�re only mortal, after all. 
You could do it. 
You could get me there ahead of her. 
Is that what you want? 
�Cause you have to ask me, that is, if it doesn�t bother you owing a favor to the god of war. 
Send me there, I�m asking. 
To prevent a murder, for the sake of friendship. 
Yeah, for friendship. 
I wanted to get there before Xena, so that I could betray her. 
I wanted to betray her. 
I gave her everything and it meant nothing to her. 
I hated her for loving someone else. 
I wanted her to hurt! 
I wanted her to be punished! 
And I almost got her killed. 
Why, my hatred and jealousy almost destroyed my best friend. 
So, now you have the answer. 
The question is, can you live with it? 
Drink.Empty the bowl. 
If the bowl is ever emptied, so go my memories. 
And the pain, all that pain. 
And the memories of my youth, my parents, my loves. 
The betrayal, the killing, the death of your child. 
And Xena. 
Bottom line, Gabrielle, you won�t miss what you never knew. 
Yep.  That�s it. 
That�s your whole life, right there. 
By the gods, I am so incredibly in love with you. 
I wish I could feel that again. 
Yeah, so do I. 
Take me, Joxer, now. 
Like the time, just before you saved Ulysses. 
OK. 
Wait. 
I wanna remember! 
Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, OK, 
yeah, so do I, so do I, but not like this! 
Is this that centurion gladiator game we used to play? 
No.  N- no.  N- n- no, no, Gabrielle. 
Look, I, I, elaborated a little bit on, some of the things I told you  about you and I, uh, a little, a little bit, lot, lots. 
Well, a lottta littles. 
I lied. 
You lied. 
What�s a lie? 
A lie is, me thinking I could give you back all your happy memories. 
I�m just, not a part of those, and I really wanted to be. 
Look, I didn�t rescue Ulysses, that was Xena. 
And I didn�t get Ares back his godhood. 
That was Xena, too. 
And I didn�t convert Hercules back from being evil. 
That was, well, it was complicated. 
And, Callisto�s not my love kitten, but look, Gabrielle, I just want the old Gabrielle back, you know? 
The one that used to smack me on the forehead and gouge out my eyes, and, just, forget everything I�ve told you. 
It�s not who you are. 
Except the part about, dancing nude in the rain, that is you. 
Joxer. 
Jerkst, hey!  Ahh! 
I have never, nor will I ever, dance in the nude in the rain with you anywhere near me. 
Gaby, you�re back! 
Yes, she is. 
Xena, you knew all along. 
That�s why, you wanted me to wait at the temple of Mnemosyne, right? 
I wondered how you made it to Ch�in ahead of me. 
I figured Ares might have a hand in it, but what I couldn�t understand was why? 
Nightmares can tell you a lotta things. 
Thank the gods, you talk in your sleep. 
I knew this was one journey you had to make without me. 
I�m just glad you made it back. 
If I didn�t have the painful memories, then I wouldn�t know what the good ones were like, right? 
I, I just couldn�t let it go, Xena, no matter what the pain. 
I�m sorry. 
No, no, it�s over. 
Welcome home. 
Hey, aren�t you forgettin� about me? 
No, Joxer, not even Mnemosyne could help her with that. 
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up with Sherry's fingerprints on it. 
I can call Foxton. 
He can make this all disappear. 
All you have to do is give me the ok. 
David put you up to this, didn't he? 
Sherry, I�� The police think I killed Alan Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut It's nobody's fault but your own Oh, my God. Sherry. 
No. 
You committed treason. You facilitated the escape of a man 
who is responsible for the death of Ryan Chappelle and almost a thousand civilians. 
With luck, the best you can hope for is 20 years Tell me how to find your couriers, Stephen Or I am going to put her in that building You wouldn't dare. She has nothing to do with this 
Neither do the people in those body bags When your daughter is infected, I am going to make you watch her die Dad, stop them Stephen, you are out of time Stop, stop, stop, I will tell you Where's the 11th vial?

 Where is it? 
 Where's what? 
Chase What are you guys doing, what's going on? 
I have got the signal. 
What are you looking for? 
It's just a transmitter He's put it on an innocent. This man is not Rabens. 
Shut the station down now The following takes place between 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm. 
This is Dessler Michelle, it's Jack We just lost Rabens He dumped the GPS beacon onto an innocent. 
Which means he still has the virus? 
We have to assume so. He couldn't have gotten very far. 
We are sweeping the station now. 
We have locked down the entire building We are gonna start moving passengers through monitored checkpoints. 
How will you find Rabens? 
We still don't have a sketch on him. 
We need Saunders to make an I.D. 
I want you to move him over from holding to Chloe's station. 
We are sending up a live feed, you should have it in a few minutes. 
Ok, we will be ready on our end. 
Michelle, Gael Ortega's wife Theresa is here All right, Jesse, send her in According to Chloe's statement, you were working in parallel to bring down Saunders, even while you were complying with his demands. 
Yeah, that's right I, I gave Chloe a recording of a conversation between Saunders and myself Chloe also said you intentionally scrambled the voice to slow down her progress. 
Tony, did you put Michelle's life ahead of public safety or national security? 
Yes, I did They said he was exposed to a virus Yeah, that's right Did he suffer? 
No, no, he went quickly Gael He was a hero He tried to stop the virus from being released, and when it was, he just kept working Till the end. 
Thank you Thank you Can I pick up his things Of course I will go see what I can do Ok Wait here Kim Yes, Michelle That's Mrs. Ortega. Gael's wife 
I need you to take her to his station, pick up his personal belongings. 
Sure Thank you Sit him down Hello Kim, I need you Saunders is here to I.D. Rabens.

Michelle said I could reassign anyone I wanted to help me, and I want you, so please don't make me ask again. 
Fine. I will get Barry to watch her 
Barry Yeah Please watch Mrs. Ortega while she gathers Gael's things. 
Sure. 
Take as much time as you need.

Who shot him? 
Gael's wife Hold on, Jack. I need medical here now

Looks critical. 
You do everything you can to keep him alive. 
He's our only connection to Rabens. 
Chase Yeah Jack Talk to me He didn't make it Son of a bitch We will get back to you Saunders has just been shot. 
He's dead Don't move, madam, don't move He killed Gael Between the information we've gotten from the captured couriers and our own intelligence, We've been able to confirm that Saunders was the sole architect of today's actions. 
If we catch this last man Arthur Rabens that'll be the end of the threat And if not, we are back to square one And the virus is back on the market. 
Find him  Hello, Wayne. 
 Joseph, could you give us a minute?? 
 Thank you, Joseph  Mr. President 
Well, did you get the prescription bottle from Sherry's house? 
? 
Yeah Well, that's good David... 
something horrible happened and I don't�� Sherry is dead What? 
How? 
ulia, she came in and she... 
she killed her, and then she turned the gun on herself They are both dead? 
Yeah Listen, I am not going to try to pretend that we can just put this behind us but the fact is�� The fact is that politically, we are free of everything Free of Milliken's extortion, his death free of Sherry's involvement. 
You are thinking of the politics of this? 
The mother of my children has just been murdered And the woman that I love just killed herself in front of me. 
I understand how you feel But there's a story here, David. 
There's a story that can tie this all together Alan Milliken was having an affair with Sherry. 
Julia found out, and then she killed them both No, no, no, I don't want to hear it  Your emotions are clouding... 
 No! 
David, please, just listen to me. 
Leave me alone. 
David, please! 
Jeanie Yes, Mr. President? 
Would you get my son and my daughter on a conference line We are going to separate the crowd into units of 10. 
I want an officer assigned to each unit. 
That officer's gonna be responsible to make sure that no one leaves that unit unless authorized by me or another CTU agent I understand We are also going to search every passenger and I mean every briefcase, purse and pocket. 
And we are gonna verify their identification. 
We will be here all day  Not if we find him  Yes, sir I want you to initiate another search of the station including the tracks, a mile in each direction. 
Thank you Yes sir. 
Jack We are locked down We got 2 men at every exit Good Is there anything else we can do right now? 
No, not until we get an I.D. on Rabens. 
Jack, listen, about Mexico... 
I hope you know I understand you were just doing your job. 
Look, it took me a long time to understand that if you want to do this job well you have to stay detached... 
If you can accept that, you will be fine Yeah Well, I have accepted it That's why I am thinking after today, I am done I don't want to be detached, Jack Not from Kim, not from my daughter I am going to request a transfer to the floor You sure about this? 
I'd still be serving my country, and take care of the people I care about I owe them that, Jack What did Kim say? 
I think she's willing to give it a try as long as I am not in Field Ops. 
What do you think, Jack? 
I am the last person you should be asking This is between you and Kim Whatever you choose, I would support You are a good man, Chase Let's go, let's go Moving in, form a line here, sir. 
Please, fast, we'll be checking your belongings and your identification You only have 9 people in your unit, Where is the man in the brown jacket? 
I don't know Chase, we have a passenger unaccounted for This is Jack Bauer, we have 2 LAPD officers down at the northwest exit. 
I need transportation to meet me on the corner. 
I am a federal agent. Did you see what happened here? 
A carjacking  Get a make on the car? 
 No This is Jack Bauer, we have got a civilian casualty on Hope and Seventh Did you see which way the car went? 
Yeah, yeah, he went straight down there I need that transportation now Michelle, this is Jack Rabens is out of the station. 
I repeat, Rabens is out. 
He was headed east on 5th street less than 5 minutes ago I need to I.D. a stolen car 
I want you to get me a DMV readout on a��  Frank Kassar  ...A Frank Kassar 
Then I want you to set up roadblocks in a 5 mile radius and coordinate SAT surveillance, traffic cameras, everything we have got Yeah Fred, it's me. I need to talk to you now 
All right. I will be right out. 
I need to step out Brad, Rabens is gone He got through the perimeter at the MTA station How the hell did that happen? 
It doesn't matter how it happened, it happened. 
We identified the vehicle he carjacked as a light blue Malibu. 
We set up a roadblock and uplinked traffic cams and satellite sweeps But I need Tony to coordinate the data flow with tactical. 
There's no downside here, Brad You know he's not a flight risk and he'd be a major asset to the operation. 
 I could be brought up on charges if I let Tony out  We can't lose Rabens So unless you want to take responsibility and run tactical yourself... 
You are wasting time, Brad We need you on the floor. 
Come on, Chloe, where's Rabens? 
Just a second, Jack I think I have got a match A light green Malibu, intersection of Fifth and Vanowen. 
Ok, we are only a few blocks away, we are gonna head over there now. 
Adam, get me a closer shot of that plate. 
Doing it now I am back in play, Jack, Michelle got me up to speed Tony, how long till the plate's I.D'd? 
Adam, do we have a match? 
Yes, it's him Jack, it's him Which direction is he headed? 
East on Del Mar, just past Franklin. 
It's this block Right there, right there Tony, we got him. He's headed south on Manning toward the Chatham Center. 
We are going to need backup Copy that Tony, where's that backup coming in from? 
From the east and from the south on a reciprocal course. 
Ok, we just made a right. 
We are headed west on De Soto Get that thing out of here now Tony, we have been cut off. 
He made a right on to Lawndale. He's headed north. 
We are about 3 blocks behind him Yeah, Jack, we have 3 vehicles in the area ready to cut him off. 
Jack, we got him pinned on Chamberlain, just north of Palm Keep him there. We are 2 blocks away 
He's running into the middle school on Chamberlain, main entrance. 
Tony, we are coming up on the middle school now. 
Tony, he's in the school. Gotta get back to you. 
Tell the arriving teams to secure the exits We can't evacuate this school. 
We run the risk of losing him. Let's move. 
Hayes, cover the west exit. 
 You got anything?? 
 Nothing Cover your exit. No one leaves this buildin 
Chase, take your men and search the auditorium All teachers and students are instructed to remain in their classrooms and lock their doors. 
I repeat: remain in the classrooms and lock the doors It's all right, children Chase, it's Jack Second floor is clear. Do you copy? 
Chase? 
No,Chase, just lay still Everything's going to be all right This is the only thing I could do to keep him from escaping with the virus. 
Don't waste your time, it's not coming off What are you talking about? 
Rabens didn't even try to remove it If he could unlock it, he would have Tony, Rabens is dead The virus is in our possession. 
But the dispersal device has been activated. 
I don't see a timer��I have got no idea how long we have got All right, Jack, I need you to find a secure container. 
Anything airtight. 
I can't do that��the device is attached to Chase's wrist. 
What? 
I will explain later. 
Right now I need you to put me in touch with one of the teams that's been able to disarm the device already. 
All right, I will get back to you. 
Hurry Just support the device Jack, I don't know how this is all going to turn out, but I want you to tell Kim that I am sorry. 
You got to tell Kim, you tell her yourself We're going to get through this. You just stay with me. 
We are going to get through this. 
 Jack, I am patching you through  OK Roger Summers here Roger, my partner had to fasten the dispersal device to his wrist to stop the courier from escaping with it. 
I need to figure out how to disarm the timer or remove the clamp Forget about the clamp. It's titanium�� 
And it's also wired into the tamper proof mechanism. 
Fine, then let's disarm the timer. What do I do? 
There's a plate at the opposite end of the clamp You need to open that up. 
Ok, I see it Chase, stay with me. Stay with me 
Ok, I have got the timer.�� 
3 minutes, 51 seconds, counting down. 
You should see 6 wires to the left��separate them from each other Ok, done Ok, the furthest to the left should be red. 
Cut it without making contact with the others. 
You ready? 
I cut the red wire, but the timer is still counting down That's ok. The timer will stop with the next cut 
Locate the green wire. It's in the group to the right 
Roger, I don't have a green wire. 
What color wires do you have? 
Orange, yellow, black and purple Jack, the devices don't match Don't panic, and don't cut any more wires until we can figure this out on our end. 
Hurry. We are running out of time. 
Jack, you need to go I am not going anywhere without you. 
Do it  They are going to call back  You have to They are going to call back It's ok This is Jack Bauer. We have a man down on the 3rd floor science lab northeast corner of the building 
requiring medical assistance Emergency, now Could you give us a minute, please? 
What's going on? 
I am back in custody. 
Hammond's taking me down to Federal. 
No, no, they can't do this Not after everything you have accomplished today. 
Michelle, I put your well being above the country's Nothing anybody can say will ever change that fact. 
But they can't��they can't put you in prison. 
Yes, they can And they will, for a long time��believe me. 
 Tony, don't talk like this. I 
 Michelle I can't, I won't give up on you Michelle, come on. Please, Michelle, don't do this 
Baby, you are alive And nobody else got hurt because of what I did And that's more than I hoped for I can live with that Even in prison Tony, it's time  This is Bauer  Agent Bauer, please hold for the President Jack Mr. President 
I wanted to thank you personally Not only for what you have done today, but for everything This country continues to owe you a great debt of gratitude. 
Thank you, sir. 
I put you in an unimaginable position earlier today, when I asked you to take the life of one of your colleagues. 
Please forgive me for that. 
Mr. President, there is nothing to forgive. 
It's what had to be done It wasn't the only sacrifice made today I understand How's agent Edmunds doing? 
He's in surgery now It's going to be a few days before we know whether or not he can use his hand Well, when he's strong enough to talk, I'd like to thank him personally. 
He would appreciate that, sir. 
You know, Jack, men and women like you, your courage and level of commitment humbles me. 
Thank you, Mr. President 
I will let everyone know at CTU that you appreciated the job they did Jack, there's one more thing and please don't discuss this with anyone until it becomes public But I wanted you to hear it from me, personally. 
I have decided not to seek reelection. 
This will be my only term Mr. President, I hope you don't mind me saying so, 
but I think you're making a mistake. 
Well, mistake or not, it's what I have decided. 
When I am a private citizen, I hope we can become better friends. 
That would be an honor, sir Thank you, Jack Thank you, Mr. President 
Come Mr. President, 
the motorcade's ready Thank you, Eric Thank you, Wayne  Dad  Hey Is Chase going to be ok? 
The doctors are very optimistic. 
They got him into surgery very quickly Oh, thank God Come here I hear you and Chase are going to make some changes. 
I am very happy for you I thought you were going to be upset about it I am so proud of you I am sure whatever choices you make will be the right ones. 
Thank you, Dad Thank you You going to be ok? 
Yeah, I am going to be fine. 
There's something I have to deal with But I am going to be fine You are going to wait here for Chase to get out of surgery? 
Yeah I've gotta leave for a little while,  but I will be back  Ok I love you I love you, too, Dad Jack, you there? 
Jack? 
This is Jack I just got a call from District They have started interrogating Saunders' courier. 
We could use your help  Jack? 
 Yeah Jack, did you copy? 
I am on my way. 
How many times have I told you, your store is growing too quickly. 
You've never told me that. 
Your books are a mess. 
When have you ever seen my books? 
I haven't seen your books,but I know you. 
Let's focus,please. 
Look,my friend kylie's a financial whiz. 
She could really help you. 
Her father was the dean of the business school here before he died. 
Before that,he was my economics department advisor. 
 You were an economics major? 
 Yes,I was an economics major. 
I was this close to getting my undergrad,ok? 
In economics? 
Yes,I can add,melinda.I'm a big boy,ok? 
Look,kylie lost her merit scholarship. 
That's her loss,but it's your gain. 
Does she have the job or not? 
Well,she might have,but she's a half an hour late, and it's my night to cook. 
Well,I think I told her 7:30. 
You cook?What do you cook? 
Tell me about it. 
Well,I make a great lasagna,you told her 7:00, and I can't hire someone who's flaky. 
She's not flaky. 
She's not.She's just. 
she's troubled. 
Why wouldn't you tell me that she's haunted? 
'Cause I don't know if she's really haunted. 
It could be anything. 
She's skittish,she's nervous, she has a hard time focusing. 
It could be any one of your college pitfalls. 
It could be sex,drugs,guitar hero. 
So you want me to give her a job just in case she has a ghost? 
And if she doesn't,what do you want me to do then? 
Clean her dorm room,do her laundry? 
Melinda,this girl's father was my mentor. 
Please.I'm begging you. 
Hi!I'm sorry I'm late. 
You're not late. 
Late was 10 minutes ago. 
You're in a different time zone,kylie! 
I know,I know,I'm not sure what happened. 
I said informal job interview. 
I didn't mean that informal. 
Oh,well,moving right along. 
Kylie,melinda,melinda,kylie. 
Hi. 
It's just,it was really dark, and I really thought that someone was. 
whatever. 
I'm sorry. 
You went out on a limb for me, and I completely blew it. 
I guess the,uh,the job is history. 
No.No,not at all. 
When do you want to start? 
I knew you two kids would hit it off. 
Can you see us? 
Proudly Presents Ghost Whisperer Season 3 Episode 15 Oh,please don't tell me those are all this month's receipts. 
No,actually,there's a bunch from april and march,january. 
Hey,is that dry cleaning receipt I've been looking for. 
Do you think they're still going to have my coat after 6 months? 
Well,it's worth giving it a try. 
Hey,this student that you hired,what's her deal? 
Uh,her name's kylie,her grades slipped, and she's trying to get her scholarship reinstated. 
I'm talking about her other deal. 
What's the reason we hired her? 
Well,I thought we weren't gonna talk about it. 
You were just gonna do your thing, I was gonna do my thing,yada yada. 
Yeah,except your thing kinda becomes my thing when you bring it into the store. 
Well,is it really going to bother you that much even if you don't believe it's real? 
No,I was just,you know,trying to know how I should act around her. 
I don't want to step on any ghost toes. 
Well,I really appreciate that. 
Um,she has a ghost. 
That's pretty much all I know so far. 
Ok.Hey,I just want to remind you 
that I've got that appointment with ned on thursday,so I won't be here all day. 
I've got it. 
It's on the calendar. 
 Hi.Am I too early? 
 No,not at all. 
I was just getting things organized for you. 
Ok. 
 Um,you know,about that  you can't start today? 
You don't want the job? 
No!No!I just. 
I just want to make sure professor payne didn't pressure you into this. 
He has a way of pushing people. 
Yeah,you noticed that,too? 
Yeah. 
So unless you,um,actually need my help,I... 
trust me,when you see the books.we need it. 
Um,I'm just gonna grab my laptop, and then you can get to work. 
Ok. 
So,how do you and professor payne actually know each other? 
Oh,we have some of the same.interests. 
Oh,my god! 
Oh!Oh,my god! 
They're all over me! 
What is this?!What is this?!What is this?! 
Get them off of me! 
Oh,my god! 
Are you ok? 
Oh,my god,melinda! 
 Go get jim. 
 Ok. 
You're ok. 
Finish it! 
Finish it! 
Delia: He was already on his way over. 
Yeah,you could hear that crash all the way across the square. 
Hey there,hi.My name's jim. 
All right,that's going to be sore for a little while. 
You were very lucky that that's safety glass. 
That could have been a lot worse. 
Assuming how the definition of luck changes depending on how bad yours is. 
Yeah,right,being attacked by a swarm of flies,not lucky. 
These things happen to you a lot? 
Daily,yeah. 
What kind of things,for example? 
Thanks,delia. 
Melinda will be back any minute with some more ice for your arm. 
Um,you know what,actually,I'm fine. 
I'll just ice it back at the dorm. 
I think you should come to the station with me and let me take a better look at that. 
You know what,it's ok. 
But thank you for everything. 
At least let me drive you home. 
No,I have a car. 
It's ok. 
Thank you. 
So did you get a chance to debrief her? 
No,she was gone before I got back. 
Jim said she couldn't have gotten out of here fast enough. 
Now,you're thinking this has something do with her father,right? 
That's the first thing I thought of, and the second,frankly. 
I mean,her father died 4 years ago. 
That's right around the time kylie started going to rockland university. 
So why would he suddenly appear now? 
Maybe he's disappointed in her studies. 
I mean,she comes from a long line of academics. 
Her grandfather founded the economics department. 
Her father was a consultant for the world bank before he retired to teach at rockland U. 
Her brother just graduated summa cum laude from here. 
The ghost said "finish it. 
" I mean,I guess that could mean college. 
Yeah,spoken just like ben,except for the plastic head part. 
It makes me wonder,if it is her father, why he wouldn't just talk to me directly. 
And what's with all the weird hauntings? 
I mean,the heavy breathing,the doll,the flies, it's all gotta be a symbol of some kind. 
Does it have anything to do with what he used to teach? 
No,he was an economist,not an entomologist. 
They're the ones that study bugs. 
I'm aware of that. 
Oh,I'm sorry. 
I'm always teaching,I can't help it.You know? 
The fact of the matter is,economists,they never speak in metaphor. 
That's probably why I never cut it as one. 
You know,nobody ever knew what the heck I was talking about. 
And that's different now in what way? 
That's very funny. 
Look,maybe we should just find out from kylie if she knows anyone who died more recently. 
Great.That would be thanatology,the study of the dead. 
Look,I know that this is hard to talk about, but when I met you, I heard a really strange.breathing noise. 
I really want to help you. 
You heard it,too,didn't you? 
What if I did,what does that mean? 
I don't know,have you heard it before? 
On occasion. 
Since when? 
Uh,a few months ago,when my scholarship got revoked. 
I'm assuming it has something to do with stress. 
Why? 
Because I can see ghosts, and I think there's one haunting you. 
Ok. 
wow. 
I don't want to sound rude,but,um, you're saying you've seen a ghost around me? 
I couldn't see his face, but he was wearing a hat and a dark overcoat. 
Does that sound familiar? 
You saw a ghost in a hat and dark overcoat? 
 Do you know what you sound like? Yes. 
Yes,I do,but if you could just go with me on it. 
Flies. 
the doll,um,weird breathing noise. 
Does that mean anything to you? 
I mean.the doll talked to you. 
I know you saw it. 
It was a talking doll. 
No,it was a ghost. 
talking to you,and it said,"finish it. 
" What does that mean? 
Finish what? 
I think this conversation. 
I have to go. 
Kylie,I really want to help you. 
Has anyone around you died recently? 
No,not really,actually. 
Could this have anything to do with your dad? 
Could scaring you be his way of getting you to finish? 
Stop it.Don't talk about my dad. 
It's bad enough that I've lost him. 
Don't make him into some freak ghost. 
And by the way,about that job,I quit. 
She's scared. 
And she's hiding something, but I'm never going to know what it is, because I'm never going to see her again. 
You're too hard on yourself. 
I should have known just to back off,you know? 
Even the word "ghost" was wigging her out. 
This is not your fault,all right? 
She was probably terrified by one of payne's lectures,right? 
Nice try.Thanks. 
Mel,what's wrong? 
Wait a minute. 
Wait a minute,it's just like that scene from that japanese horror film! 
What was? 
The vision I just had! 
Flies! 
Amityville horror,or the fly! 
The...the doll. 
Puppet master,or chucky! 
The overcoat. 
Oh,my god,the overcoat. 
Just pick one. 
I can't believe i r-neve-I can't believe I didn't see it! 
See what? 
The hauntings. 
They're all scenes from hvir moorroes. 
Let's narrow this down. 
We need to find someone who's close to you that died recently that was a horror film buff. 
Anything? 
Well,what do you expect? 
I expect you to tell me the truth if you want help. 
Look,if melinda says you have a ghost,hey,you have a ghost. 
Ok,so what if I have one? 
What...what's the deal? 
What does that mean? 
Well,ghosts,if they're here, it's usually because they have unfinished business. 
 Like what? 
 Whatever. 
It could be anything with a loved one. 
It could be unresolved issues of guilt,anger,forgiveness. 
Can.this ghost hurt me? 
Actually,if they get angry,they can get pretty nasty. 
What aren't you telling me,kylie? 
There's something you're not telling me. 
Did somebody close to you die? 
I need to know. 
No,I've known people to die,yeah, but no one close or anything. 
Hey,kylie. 
Cram session. 
Let's get a move on. 
I have to go. 
I don't want to be the first sloan to not graduate. 
Are you at the film school yet? 
Did you get any answers? 
Rick: Yes,nothing happened,no one died. 
I'm telling you,no faculty members, no janitors,no students,nothing. 
If something like that happened, it would have been all over the campus. 
It's not,uh,it's not like we drop like flies around here,no pun intended. 
Well,aren't there any students that are into the genre? 
I mean,there is a class or a club or anything? 
I'm looking. 
I'm at the bulletin board now. 
There's a flyer up here for musical theater club. 
That's spooky. 
Keep looking. 
What else do I have?I have a missing kitty. 
All right,this is different. 
"Scared sane... "we're holding auditions 
for a new kind of horror film. 
"Ever wonder why some movies terrify you? 
"Are you brave enough to enter your own personal horror "to see what lies within? 
Enlightenment awaits. 
" Sounds like a real horror buff. 
Is there a name,phone number,anything? 
Let's see,auditions are at some downtown production facility. 
There's a name,toby bates, but as far as a number goes,you're out of luck. 
It's a couple months old. 
Well,fax it over and I'll check it out. 
 Ok. 
 Thanks. 
Hangs up phone Toby. 
Ringing Toby? 
I'm looking for toby bates. 
Hello? 
Is anyone there? 
Why do I always get the scary stuff? 
Who are you? 
Oh, you want to play? 
Is that it? 
Ok. 
So which one is this? 
The maze from the shining, children of the corn, or the spaceship from alien? 
What? 
Who are you? 
So what is this? 
The maze from the shining, children of the corn or the spaceship from alien? What? 
Oh, you want to play? 
Oh, you want to play? 
Ok, here it is, toby bates' obit. 
"Guerilla filmmaker falls to his death." 
This happened 3 months ago. 
Oh, that's right, when kylie said the hauntings started. 
She said no one close to her died. 
We should ask her if she knew this kid toby. 
It says he wasn't a student, so that's not their connection. 
He was just a kid shooting a film. 
Yeah, lots and lots of film apparently. 
There's massive amounts of files on this computer. 
Thank goodness you had the mental fortitude to steal it. 
Hey, I did not steal it. 
This ghost wanted my help, led me to that editing bay, and in fact, probably wanted me to take it. 
What I still want to know is what are we going to do about skippy here. 
I mean, what is he good for except for a free ride in the carpool lane? 
And what's he doing in my good chair? 
More importantly, why is he wearing toby's clothes? 
I mean, it's gotta be a prop from one of his movies, right? 
I hope so. 
Oh, listen to his profile. 
"I want to push classic horror past the scare to enlightenment, use the genre to dive into the darkness of souls and set them free." 
To think I was just watching scary movies for fun. 
Do you think kylie was in one of toby's movies and that's how they met? 
There's an audition file in there. 
I think we could look to see if she's in it. 
What horror movie really scares you? 
That movie where the arm comes up out of the grave and it likeugh like, super creepy, yeah. 
What--wait a minute. 
I know this kid. 
He's one of kylie's friends. 
well, that's great. So 
there's a connection at least. 
I mean, you can talk to this bruce guy tomorrow and find out what he'll tell us. 
I mean, maybe he's being haunted, too. 
No, I'm not--I'm not talking to him. 
You do the talky talk. 
That's your job. 
It always has been. 
Except that I have to be at my other job tomorrow. 
Delia's got the day off. 
Look, you're gonna be great. 
What are we gonna do about her? 
Yeah, I remember this. 
Actually worked on this film. 
Guy called it a "shockumentary," making you face your fears. 
I call it sick. 
Well, after you worked in it, did you notice anything strange or supernatural that happened to you in the last 3 months? 
I aced my bio quiz. 
Wow, that is spooky, my man. 
I don't know how you sleep at night. 
Anything, for real? 
Did you notice anything? 
No, man, it was just a movie. 
All right. 
Well, what is a shockumentary? What is that? 
He would ask you what classic horror movies scared you the most, and then, you know, he'd put you in the scariest scenes, making you experience the horror over and over again. 
Guy was a psycho. 
Now, I didn't know a movie that's scared me, so he put me in somebody else's fear. 
I play the priest in the exorcist. 
This guy just liked scaring people, or was there a point to all of it? 
I don't know. I didn't 
stick around to find out. 
Hey, brother, I don't blame you. 
I wasn't scared, I was pissed. 
I ran into a friend that night who had just wrapped her segment, looked like she got in a car accident. 
She said her scariest movies were blair witch and evil dead, so toby left her alone in the woods for a whole night. 
Nearly lost her mind. 
Was kylie in a movie? 
No, she had no interest in acting. 
I didn't think so. 
But she sure grilled toby about what he was doing. 
I didn't know she was such a major horror buff. 
Wait a minute, kylie and toby, they met? 
Yeah. I dragged 
her along with me. 
Toby even wanted her to audition for it. 
She said no, and it got kinda nasty. 
What else happened? 
Oh, we left. 
But you should have seen the look on toby's face. 
He was pissed. 
So kylie was at the audition, she did meet toby. 
Yeah, turns out she's a giant horror film buff. 
She even insulted his work. 
So why has she been covering it with us? 
Have I not been trying to figure that out the entire ride over here? 
I don't know, I wasn't with you. 
You're right, that was, uh, skippy. I forget. 
You guys look so much alike. 
Well, we were trying to figure out, and we came up with nothing, we were stymied. 
So we called kylie's cell phone and it went right to voicemail. 
It's ok, she'll call back when she gets scared enough and it'll probably be soon. Look at this. 
I spent the last 3 hours looking at more of toby's footage. 
Ooh, I feel your pain. 
You know, the big crime is efthat bore this kid died, he didn't set some time aside to edit. 
Well, actually, he did. 
I found something that looked like a movie he was starting to assemble. Brace yourself. 
Oh, my gosh! 
That person was actually buried alive! 
How is that therapy? 
How could toby get away with something like that? 
Actors will pretty much do anything to get themselves on film. 
So this is a shockumentary. 
Yeah, all the segments are about 5 minutes long, and he's put 6 together so far. 
Let's see, you have cindy's fear: Friday the 13th, janet's fear: I know what you did last summer. 
billy's fear... 
yeah, he cast on fear, not type. 
I mean, it's pretty terrifying, I had to turn it off. 
Well, that's weird, melinda. 
I mean, some of the date stamps on these edits are within the last month. 
One of these is from yesterday! 
But one of us had the computer the whole time. 
I mean, he couldn't have cut it, could he? 
Why couldn't he? 
I mean, we've seen him manipulate footage, surveillance camera stuff. 
I mean, it's not that far of a leap. 
He's making his movie from the grave. 
********I'm home. 
Thank god you're home. 
This movie's really starting to freak me out. 
What is it? 
It's the movie that the ghost was making, or is making. 
And your favorite genre. 
No, except this one's different. 
These are real people, and they're really scared. 
It's like freddy krueger meets punk'D. 
Apparently kylie tiedck this guy off in an audition. 
Well, I know he's a ghost, so that's not good. 
Yeah, I'm just trying to see if there's any more to it. 
Well, if you're actually sort of scared, why don't you turn the lights on? 
Are you kidding me? 
And ruin the fun? 
I don't understand you people. 
I'm gonna hit the shower. 
Get me the hell out of here! 
What are you afraid of? 
I want out! 
I know you're... 
what are you afraid of? 
Jim, stop it, seriously. 
What are you afraid of? 
All right, that's it! 
Toby, stop it! 
Do you hear me?! 
It was bad enough when you were alive. 
I thought you wanted to play. 
I thought you loved those slasher movies. 
You have to stop doing this. 
Just let me try and help you move on. 
Not until she finishes it. 
Who, kylie? 
What is it that you want her to finish? 
Ask her. She knows. 
Did you talk to kylie? 
No, I called, went by her dorm. 
I think she's avoiding us, and there's something you should see. 
Yeah. 
Was that a person?! 
No. That was 
skippy over there. 
But I know why you're queasy. 
Does any of that look familiar? 
That's the place where toby died. 
I recognize the for rent sign from his obituary. 
He was doing a stunt. 
That's how he died. 
Wait a minute. 
Shouldn't you buy him a drink first? 
Look, ok? 
The movie that he was making before he died, it was the exorcist. 
I'm with you, I think. 
The falling through the glass, the heavy breathing, the things that he was haunting kylie with, it's all things from the movie, so it has to mean something to her. 
Wait a minute, what was that? 
I didn't see that before. 
It's one of the soundtracks attached to the raw footage. 
They must have mixed it down into logged clips. 
let's do one more. 
What? 
Well, that's toby, but you can hear someone else. Listen. 
What? Why? We're not gonna 
get a better take than that. 
It's kylie. 
Yeah. 
She was working with him. 
Just not in front of the camera. 
Hey, kylie, it's melinda. 
If you're there, please pick up. 
I need to talk to you. 
I know you were working with toby. 
What I don't understand is why you didn't tell us. 
I know you're scared, but you need to let us help you before this gets even worse. Just 
Testing, testing. 
Final death scene, take one. 
Final death scene, take one. 
Final death scene, take one. 
Testing.Final death 
scene, take one. 
Final death scene, take one. 
Death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene death scene, death scene, death scene, all right, I need you to tell me the truth. What happened? 
Death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene I killed him. 
Death scene, death scene, death scene, death scene. 
I.********* 
I just didn't want to believe you. 
The thought of toby haunting me is. 
it's too awful. 
Why don't you tell me exactly what happened that night. 
I was supposed to be there. 
He had the shot all set up. 
It was actually pretty cool. 
This interior angle shot of the priest falling. 
Bruce quit, so toby had to stand in. 
It was a 2-person job. 
And I guess he tripped, and fell. 
It's horrible. 
That's what happened to toby. 
But you weren't there. 
It was an accident, so. 
why do you think it's your fault? 
Because. 
that's the day I lost my scholarship. 
I've just been so invested in making this movie that I've let my course work slip. 
I'm skipping deadlines, I'm flunking tests. 
You--you can't quit. 
This is our baby. 
No, this is your baby. 
And it's been fun, and we've had our kicks, but it's over. 
No, you don't understand. 
I'm doing this for you. 
You need to face your fears. 
Please don'T. 
I don't want to do this. 
Yes, you do, and that's what scares you. 
I haven't even told my friends about working with you. 
What embarrasses you more, me or making movies? 
It's just. it's not me. 
Yes, it is. 
What is holding you back? You can do this. 
Why are you turning your back on it? 
You love making movies. 
Why is what I do so important to you? 
Do you have something to say? 
'Cause if you do, say it. 
I want to hear it. 
I do. 
This isn't about me. 
It's never about you. 
You think hiding behind a camera gives you a pass. 
From our friendship and from all human interaction. 
No, that's the only way that it works. 
Ok, that's the only way that I can get people to be themselves on camera. 
I have to be invisible. 
I hope you and your camera have a very happy life together. 
I'm done. 
I shouldn't have walked away like that. 
I don't think toby's haunting you because he thinks you killed him. 
Of course he does, why else would he be doing this? 
I think he wants you to face your worst fear, whatever it is about that movie. 
God. 
I'm so tired of hearing that. 
What do you mean? 
I know why the exorcist scares me. 
The day my dad died, a priest was reading his last rites. 
It was horrible. 
That's why I can't-- I can't watch that movie. 
I get it. 
Nowhw at? 
I don't know. 
I don't understand what he wants, then. 
I want her to finish it. 
If she's faced her fears, I want her to finish it. 
Finish what? 
Is he here? 
He was. 
What did he say? 
He said if you faced your fears, he wants you to finish it. 
Do you know what that means? 
It means. 
he's not gonna stop. 
And this isn't gonna end, and you can'T. 
help me. 
Yes, I can. 
I promise. 
You need to leave kylie alone. 
That's funny. 
I was going to say the same thing to you. 
You're making it worse. 
She needs to figure it out on her own. 
Why is that important to you, that she finishes the movie? 
Why do you this to people? 
Everyone has something that they're afraid of; something that holds them back. 
There's always a reason. 
Like you,and those slasher films. 
Let's look at that. 
Give me a break. 
Don't you ever wonder why those films leave you feeling sick and exposed? 
What deep,dark memory do they stir? 
I don't need your help. 
Those films are usually about abandonment. 
Who abandoned you,melinda? 
Who left you alone in the dark? 
Your mother? 
Your father? 
That's it,isn't it? 
 Was he a  stop it. 
I am all for self reflection, but you're the earth-bound spirit. 
You're the one who has issues. 
Are you sure? 
By the way,kylie's going to finish what we started. 
She has no choice. 
Ok,toby,I'm here. 
This is where we were going to shoot the last. 
it's where you died. 
Did you want to see me scared? 
Did you want to see me... 
...crack? 
Well,it worked. 
I'm terrified. 
Now what do you want from me? 
Is this it? 
I don't get it. 
I am trying,damn it! 
I've done everything that you wanted! 
I watched the movie a million times! 
I don't know what I'm supposed to face! 
I'm done living it! 
Do I have to die,too? 
Do I have to die,too? 
Wow,you really know what you're doing. 
Tell that to this machine. 
What is wrong with this thing?! 
What do you want from me?! 
I shot your movie,I cut it! 
It's finished. Just let me be done with it! 
Kylie,everything's going to be ok. 
No,it's not. 
He won't let me lock the cut. 
He won't let me finish. 
Kylie,no one's here. 
He's been here all night. 
He's haunted me every step. 
I beliyoeve U. 
Why do you think he's doing that? 
I don't know,I told you. 
Tell me about the breathing. 
What about it? 
Toby seems to think it's the key, and you're the only one who knows why. 
The breathing. 
is it about your father,the way he died? 
The summer before I leorft f rockland, I had,uh,I had an internship at this investment firm in the city. 
And every day I ate lunch at the washington square park. 
It's right by nyu.A lot of film 
students hung out there, and I would just.do wardrobe, 
grip,camera,whatever they needed. 
It was. 
it was the best summer of my life. 
But what I didn't know was that entire time. 
my dad was dying. 
Your family didn't tell you? 
They didn't want to distract me, I guess,from my work. 
I would have taken any excuse to quit. 
I didn't want to go into finance, I wanted to make films. 
And I was gonna tell him. 
After the summer was over. 
But then one morning,my mom called and she said I'd better get home,and. 
I couldn't believe. 
how frail he looked. How weak he was. 
He kept slipping in and out of consciousness, and then finally,he smiled at me. 
He told me to come close. 
That's--that's probably why the breathing was so hard for me, that night. 
And the last words he said to me,. 
he could barely speak And when I looked up,and I saw the priest, I knew he was dying. 
What things did he say to you? 
He said I would always be his angel, and that I was just so much like him. 
What else? 
Think. 
I would do great things. 
I would never let him down. 
But I did let him down. 
I lost my scholarship. 
I've given up completely on everything that he would have wanted for me,. 
everything he cared about Kylie. 
he cared about you. 
He wouldn't be proud of me making horror films! 
Do you like making horror films? 
More than anything. 
Well,I'm pretty darn sure he'd be impressed with you making horror films. 
No,not dad. You knew him.He's... 
yeah,I knew him. 
Who do you think it was that convinced me to write books about voodoo? 
Not my father. 
Yes,your father,my friend ben told me, and I'm only mildly paraphrasing here, he said,"rick,if I had half the passion for numbers that you have for shrunken heads, "I would run,I wouldn't walk, to the nearest convention of the dead. 
" And that's what I did,kylie. 
That's what he meant that day. 
That's what he was trying to say to you, that if you find your passion, you'll do great things. 
Don't you see that? 
It worked. 
She did it. 
She figured out what was holding her back. 
Yeah. 
Now how about you? 
This was about kylie, about her following her dream. 
I'm--I'm done. 
Is this. 
is toby here? 
Yes. 
I think there's something he'd like to say to you. 
Oh,no,there isn'T. 
Is he hiding? 
He doesn't like it when the camera's on him. 
This could be your last chance to ever talk to her. 
Go for it. 
Face your fears. 
It's funny,because my whole life, I tried to be invisible. 
Now I'd give anything for her to be able to see me. 
He wishes that you could see him right now. 
Tell him I can. 
Really? 
It's that angle 2 shot. 
we did. 
At the beach. 
With the guy and the girl. 
It's sunset,and they were so afraid to tell each other how they felt. 
And the world was coming to an end. 
Tell her I remember. 
Oh,man. 
Look at that. 
He sees the light. 
Tell her I'll save her a good seat. 
Who are you? 
What do you want? 
Melinda! 
Hey,what's up? 
 What's going on? 
 I just had the worst dream. 
Are you ok? That's crazy 
No,it was so real. 
It's like it actually happened. 
There was this strange man coming towards me, and he had on a mask. 
The guy in the horror flick. 
No,this was real. 
 Honey,it's just a dream. 
 No. 
This happened. 
This was a memory. 
When I was younger. 
this happened to me. 
Hey,come here. 
hi.Wow.Good morning,indeed. 
You just missed a fascinating hour on megalithomania. 
Oh.That's my favorite. 
Um,actually,could I talk to you for a minute? 
Well,yeah.For you,I have more than a minute. 
Well,I don't know how to say this,except. 
being with you last night reminded me of how much it hurt when you dumped me. 
Oh,I--I prefer to say,"broke up with. 
" See,and I can't get my heart broken again,ricky. 
So it was fun. 
 Nina. 
 Hey. 
You take care of yourself.Ok? 
Nina.Come on. 
Nina,come on. 
Are you happy now,darling? 
As if that's possible. 
Honey,you want a glass of wine? 
No,thanks. 
Makes me sleepy. 
Melinda,you can't stay awake forever. 
And lookin' at these masks is not doin' you any good right now. 
I'm just trying to figure out which mask the guy's wearing in one of my dreams or memories,whatever they are. 
I know,but maybe you should take a break. 
I don't know. 
Uh,maybe help kate cross over. 
Staying away from that one. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
Payne doesn't want my help. 
He seems to think this is his chance to get back at her, and she doesn't wanna go anywhere near a light,so. 
yeah.I get it. 
Mel,I'm worried about you. 
You hardly get any sleep these days. 
And when you do,your nightmares are getting worse. 
The only way it's gonna stop is if I can figure out who this mask guy is and what he's trying to tell me. 
I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my father. 
Well,do you think you should talk to a professional? 
I don't need therapy. 
No,I mean,do you think you should talk to a private investigator? 
Remember my cop friend,carl neely? 
It's what he does.He moonlights. 
I mean,he could tell you how your dad died,when,where he's buried,even. 
You want me to call him? 
Ricky. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
Hi. 
What are you doin' here? 
Uh,I'm sorry about the hour,but, uh,it's just-- can I come in? 
 Uh,no. 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. 
Um,I'll come out. 
Look,uh,I-- I don't,uh,blame you. 
I wouldn't really trust me either. 
But you need to know this. 
I had--well,I had my heart broken,twice,as a matter of fact. 
I mean,once when kate died,and then another time after she was already dead, I found out that she had an affair. 
I'm sorry.I--I didn't know. 
I'm much more sensitive to people's hearts since my heart has been ripped out and kicked around like a hacky sack. 
And the fact of the matter is we really had a good time last night. 
Yeah,we did.I know 
'cause if you're in town for a week, we should make a go of this thing, I mean,go have lunch.What's lunch? 
Nobody ever got hurt by a lunch,unless of course there was a food-borne illness, and-- why are we whispering,exactly? 
You're not alone in there,are you? 
No. 
No. 
But it's not what you're thinking. 
Mom,who you talkin' to? 
Just a friend,baby.You go back to sleep,ok? 
"Mom"? 
I usually detonate that bomb on the third or fourth date,but yes. 
I have a son. 
His name is elliot. 
And since I would have to bring him to lunch tomorrow,you can flee now. 
No.No,I'm not fleeing. 
Oh,no. 
You-- you should bring him to lunch with us. 
I love kids.What kind of a guy doesn't like kids? 
I hate kids! 
Maybe "hate" is a strong word,but I have a profound lack of understanding for the need to breed. 
Plus,all kids are just filled with snot. 
So it's a nonstarter for you. 
I just think single moms are dicey. 
None taken. 
What? 
I was just hopin' you'd throw a "no offense" my way,but guess I gave you too much credit. 
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.But your son ned,he's different. 
He's a-- he's a teen or tween or whatever they're called. 
Teen'll do. 
He's a teen. 
And look,he's interacting. 
Cyclical conversation. 
He's fine. 
He's self-sufficient. 
Nina's son isn't going to be self-sufficient,and he's gonna be a complete germ bag,for crying out loud. 
Hey.You are a mom. 
You could help me. 
You--you can watch this kid while I go to lunch. 
Oh,sorry,but I am taking my son on a dicey single-mom lunch. 
Let's go,ned. 
 So what's the deal with that guy? 
 You don't want to know. 
Don't even look at me. 
Hi,guys. 
This is elliot. 
El,it's professor payne. 
Hello,young man. 
How are you? 
Hello,professor payne. 
Please,call me,uh-- actually, call me professor.That's good. 
Hi.Elliot,I'm melinda. 
Some people think dust is mostly flakes from human skin. 
Elliot. 
A-actually dust is a lot of things. 
Could be pet dander,pollen. 
It could be soot. 
Yeah,but its overall makeup depends on where you live. 
I think the human skin thing was started to sell dust spray. 
Are you an academician? 
Oh,spare me. 
Nobody but rick's that pretentious. 
As a matter of fact,I am. 
Why would you ask me that? 
So's my dad. 
You see,his,um,dad's not really in the picture. 
He's-- he's on an extended sabbatical in india. 
They can't get text messages there. 
Mind if i take a look at your victrola? 
No.Go right ahead. 
Uh,elliot,how old are you exactly? 
Almost 10,sir. 
That's a decade. 
When's your birthday? 
August 27. 
I'm a virgo. 
And we broke up in. 
this isn't happening. 
Maybe it's not what it seems. 
Can I talk to you alone? 
I just remembered we've got a, uh,thing we're gonna be late for. 
El,baby,come on.We gotta go. 
Nice to meet you all. 
Bye,guys. 
there's no way I'm that kid's father,right? 
Well,ignoring what she's already told him about his dad, the fact that he seems to have your dna,math you're not helping. 
You asked. 
I know I asked. 
You could always take a paternity test. 
And confirm something that I don't want to be true? 
She hasn't exactly demanded one. 
It's my own darn fault for chasing after her. 
I--I didn't want kids when I was married,let alone now. 
Oh,neither do I,not yet anyway. 
Why don't you want kids? 
Do you mind me asking? 
I do mind,actually,but I will answer. 
It's your porch. 
Kids are a huge responsibility, and,uh,I'm selfish. 
What's your excuse? 
I'm afraid of juggling,you know, the-- the feeding and the diapers while dead people harass me. 
You win. 
I can't be a dad. 
Look at me.I'm not father material. 
I'm a miscreant of epic proportions. 
Well,that's true. 
All right. 
Besides,we don't even know if this is what nina wants. 
Who knows what nina wants? 
There's one way to find out. 
I--you know what? 
I hate talking to you. 
I promote to a knight. 
I found out I was pregnant after you left,and I was so scared,ricky. 
And I was gonna tell you,but you were. 
already with kate,happy. 
From the sounds of it,you've all but told him I'm his dad. 
No.I just kind of,you know, 
dress it up a little.that way, 
if he ever does find out, it won't be such a shock to him. 
Doesn't he have a right to know who his father is? 
It's complicated. 
 Check. 
 What again? 
Oh,nice. 
And he's mine. 
He's brilliant. 
He didn't get it from me. 
Don't underestimate yourself. 
I,uh-- I tried to enroll him at archfield academy. 
That's good.That's a good 
school for pint-sized mensas. 
Eh,it's not gonna happen wait a minute.This kid could get into yale. 
There's no way he didn't get accepted there. 
Eh,he did. 
It's just they-- they only have 2 financial aid slots open. 
He seems to be doin' ok at public school. 
Public school? 
Nina,no. 
No,this kid's a genius. 
You put him in public school,it's like putting raw meat in a piranha tank. 
They'll eat him alive. 
You can't do that to him. 
I don't sell enough antidepressants to pay for it. 
When kate died,I got a call from my life insurance company. 
Here's my wife of 8 years dies in a freak accident. 
Now they just wanna cut me a check. 
I felt pretty awkward about it. 
I didn't know what to do. 
I never invested the money. 
I just kept it in my savings account. 
Bottom line is I'd like to use that money to pay for elliot's school. 
No. 
Ricky,that's too generous. 
Now,I didn't come here to ask you for money. 
I didn't come here to ask you for anything. 
I know that. 
I'm pretty sure that's what kate would have wanted. 
You should move your pawn. 
Don't count on it. 
I don't need you to teach me how to play chess,kid. 
I'm just saying,if I were you--I'd sacrifice my pawn. 
Ah,he really is a chip off the old payne,isn't he? 
Alexander,you mind if I cut in? 
This kid's too smart for me. 
Well,don't blame it on him. 
It's just his dna,I guess. 
Unbelievable. 
Do you mind if I finish his game? 
Sure,professor,but you'll lose. 
Whoa! 
How 'bout you and i start from scratch? 
Honey,I'm home. 
Oh,how many times have I told you about leavin' your shoes in the foyer,kate? 
You know,kate,the scientist in me is very intrigued, but the human being in me has hair standing up in places that I didn't even know that I had hair. 
Come on,kate! 
Is that the best you got?! 
All right. 
Getting better. 
Oh,honey,that is such a textbook haunting. 
A screw. 
Are you tryin' to tell me something? 
Ok,fine! 
You wanna have this out! 
Let's have it out right now! 
You cheated on me with one of my colleagues! 
So what right do you have to be mad at me?! 
You think this is about infidelity? 
What was that,honey? 
I didn't quite hear you. 
payne,where are you? 
Here's something I never thought I'd say-- I'm in here under the piano. 
Oh,my.god 
are you ok? 
Well,not to be captain obvious,but not really. 
There's an 800-pound baby grand on my back. 
Can you feel anything? 
Yes,jim,I can feel everything. 
Thank you. 
I'm gonna get the car jack. 
I'm so sorry. 
How's that? 
Ahh.It only hurts when it hurts. 
We're gonna have to get this x-rayed and get you to the emergency room. 
So you gonna tell me what happened? 
Well,I was drunk. 
I came home. 
I decided to plow through my own bookcase,swing from the chandelier, and then me and the piano rolled around on the floor-- all right. 
I got in a fight with kate. 
Yeah.She's obviously trying to tell you something. 
Right. 
It's like ghost charades with props. 
You know,she seemed pretty upset the day that you met elliot. 
Is there something you're not telling me? 
Well,kate wanted kids,and so did i for a brief,brief moment of insanity, and we tried everything,all the fertility drugs. 
It was killing kate that nothing was working, and I told her,"don't worry about it. 
I don't even want kids," but you know the way i have that great talent for saying things the wrong way. 
It just--it got ugly. 
Now you have one,a kid. 
And she doesn'T. 
That hurt? 
Ah,compared to being under a piano,it's ok. 
Do you think that's why she's upset,because of elliot? 
Well,I think it's only gonna get worse until she crosses over. 
Well,look,I don't speak ghost, and I don't do humility very well. 
Would you please talk to her,mediate,whatever? 
Yes. 
 Hey.Please? 
 Ok. 
Just stop baiting her. 
I will not bait her anymore. 
What's that look? 
Nothing. 
 Hey. 
 How is he? 
Lucky. 
His foot's pretty banged up,but,uh, hairline fracture of the tibia, \and he broke his little toe. 
He'll be fine. 
Look,uh. 
I heard you two talking about how much payne's wife wanted a kid. 
 And I hate to bring this up again,but  I'm so sorry. 
Could you just hold that thought? 
I always do. 
Maternity Ward Nursery Labor & Delivery You could have killed him. 
I lost my temper. 
He has that effect on me. 
And anyway,I thought he could stand to suffer a little. 
Hasn't he done that already? 
I mean,it's been 3 years,kate. 
It's time for you to let him move on. 
The way he's let me move on? 
He told me you wanted a baby. 
Oh,I know what he told you. 
I'm a ghost,darling. 
I can go places,hear things. 
It's the only upside to an otherwise lousy state. 
I'm sorry.I really need your help. 
I was here first. 
Sorry. 
That happens all the time. 
Look,obviously you're upset that he has a child. 
 Ok,it doesn't seem fair,and I get that. 
 Do you? 
She shows up here with this boy and plays her sad little violin about needing money to get him into some special school, and he's all too ready to just write her a check for my life insurance money,no less. 
Seems a bit sketchy to me. 
So you think she's playing him. 
You're a clever girl. 
Figure it out. 
Hey,you. 
What happened? 
Broke my vestigial appendage. 
 I'm fine,though.Can I talk to you? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah,but just let me go first,ok? 
 Ok. 
All right.Um. 
I thought about your offer to pay for elliot's school,and. 
I accept. 
And then I I swear we'll go back to the city, and you'll never hear from us again. 
I've been thinkin' a lot about it,too, and I don't wanna be a checkbook dad,nina. 
So the offer's no good anymore? 
No,the--the offer still stands. 
I just wanna sw-sweeten the pot. 
I-I've thought a lot about it,and that is,I-if I'm... 
ok,if I'm going to be elliot's dad, then I wanna be elliot's dad. 
How would that work exactly? 
Well,we could take it slow. 
You don't have to tell him right away. 
You guys can move in with me. 
Oh,r-ricky,wait.Slow down. 
No,uh,it's not-- you know. 
I have lots of space,lots of space, and you and I,we don't have to be this instant couple right away. 
We don't even have to be a couple at all, even,you know,but,um, there's a great satellite school that the college offers for gifted children. 
We could enroll elliot there and I just--I don't know. 
I think I'm ready. 
I'm really ready to be a dad. 
At least,I'm ready to give it a try. 
So,uh,how is this all goin' over at home? 
Well,you can tell that jim wants to talk about it. 
I keep sidestepping. 
I mean,what's the big rush,right? 
There's gotta be some huge compromise somewhere between forever and right now. 
Yeah,except for men pretty much have forever, and women don'T. 
I'm still young. 
ish...Ok?There's plenty of time. 
Besides,I have to cross kate over, and I can't do that until I find out if nina's telling the truth, which means you should stop changing the subject. 
You know,you could always get that P.I. 
you hired to help you out. 
And distract him from getting me more information on my dad? 
I don't think so. 
You know what I really need to do is just yank a hair right out of payne's head and then do my own paternity test. 
You know,as much fun as that sounds, I have a simpler idea. 
Ready? 
Hello.Yes, 
is principal stickley available for dean julia marlowe from the archfield academy? 
It's regarding elliot haley. 
I'll hold. 
This sleuthing stuff is kinda fun. 
You're oddly good at it. 
Yes.One moment,please,for dean marlow. 
Hello.Principal stickley. 
Yes,we did receive elliot's application, but the birth certificate,though, I-it was a fax of a fax, and so you know how that goes. 
We really need to get the father's name. 
Pen. 
Yes. 
Thank you so much for your trouble. 
Damn. 
I think you're just beating yourself up over an accident. 
Your time here earthbound, it's about your redemption. 
You did that. 
You made that sacrifice. 
But is it that simple? 
It is if you can see the light. 
Yeah. 
Yeah,it's-- it's on the other side of that car. 
What do I do? 
Go into it. 
Sort things out on the other side. 
 Another one. 
 Yep. 
Just a random ghost. 
Sometimes I wish they'd just leave me alone. 
Yeah,you and me both. 
So what am I gonna do? 
I mean,am I gonna talk to rick,am I gonna confront nina, or am I gonna just move to canada? 
You'll figure it out.You always do. 
That was really helpful.Thanks. 
You want my real opinion? 
I feel like you should tell rick first. 
Why? 
'Cause you guys have so much in common, I think he'll be relieved that the kid is not his. 
So that's why you're being distant. 
We've talked about this. 
Yeah,I know.We've talked,and we've talked, 
and,melinda,I gotta say sometimes I feel like you use your gift as an excuse and that you care more about the dead than that is not fair,ok? 
I'm just not ready to have a baby. 
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever will. 
I mean,we've been married 3 years. 
Yeah,and we're still young. 
Yeah. 
So were payne and kate. 
Look what happened to them. 
 I gotta go to work. 
 Yep. 
Let me know how it goes with carl. 
Have to tell you up front,melinda, your father left a pretty cold trail. 
Since 1989? 
Uh,'91,2 years after you said he left you and your mother for good. 
Drained his bank account.Cashed out his ira. 
Went back to the woman in colorado he had a son with. 
Gabriel,my half-brother. 
Other than that,the only record I have of him is workin' as a short-order cook at a debby's in arizona. 
What? 
I mean,my dad was a lawyer. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
It does if he was on the run from somethin'. 
The run from what? 
Melinda,when you first asked me to look into this, you told me your father was dead. 
You were pretty certain of that. 
Yeah.I guess I have... 
been telling myself that for so long that I started to believe it. 
There's no record of his death? 
Not that I could find. 
No burial.No cremation. 
The list of john does in this country's huge, and without dental records or dna, it's a needle in a haystack. 
Look,I have some other leads,but--heh. 
I'm startin' to feel guilty takin' your money. 
You found out more than I ever could. 
Well,it's your call. 
Just don't give up,please. 
I really need to know. 
So I guess the final question is just do I make the check out to archfield academy, or,I mean,I could make the check out to the school that's here in grandview. 
I'm not tryin' to force a decision. 
I know. 
I'm just gonna need to take some time to think about it,so. 
maybe if you just make the check out to me, I can put it into elliot's school fund. 
That way,I can prove I can afford whichever school he applies to. 
What are these,professor? 
Those are my fetishes. 
Ricky? 
He's 10. 
I know he's 10. 
That's actually what they're called. 
They're called fetishes. 
They're carvings from an ancient zuni tribe from new mexico. 
They carve each animal, and they think that there's a spirit inside them, giving each one a very specific power. 
Why don't you pick one up and give it a try? 
Ah.The wily fox. 
He keeps his owner safe. 
What you do is you put his nostrils in your mouth Inhales And you inhale. 
Go ahead.Give it a try. 
No,thanks.It's still flu season. 
Hi,everyone. 
Hey. 
Actually,I'm here to see nina. 
 You are?\n Yeah. 
Who's brian dobbs? 
Who? 
He was on the birth certificate as the father. 
 How did you f  I made a phone call. 
And I can make some more.Yeah.Do I need to? 
 It's not what you think. 
 It's exactly what I think. 
The question is are you gonna tell payne,or am I? 
Hey. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 No.Right on time. 
Technically I should have them stored in cornmeal. 
That's what they eat,and the more they eat, the better they are,and the more power they have. 
Uh,nina said that is was ok for delia to take elliot for some ice cream. 
Ok.What's going on? 
Come on. 
We'll be in the cafeteria. 
Brian dobbs? 
The guy that used to hang out in the laundry room of our building,brian dobbs? 
Anyway,he was nice to me. 
After you started hangin' out with kate, I saw the writing on the wall. 
So he took advantage of you. 
After you left,I found out I was 3 months pregnant. 
When I told brian,he demanded I take a paternity test. 
Kind of backfired on him. 
He hung around for about a year. 
Then he split. 
Then what happened? 
Bastard stole my social security number. 
All of a sudden,I've got all these these credit card bills piling up. 
I find out he's drained my savings account, and I haven't heard from him since. 
He left me with a oneyear old and buried under a mountain of debt, and I've been killin' myself, tryin' to pay it off for years, and now it's gonna cost my son his school. 
I've never done anything like this before. 
Why me? 
Why'd you start with me? 
I just thought the rick payne I remembered would. 
give me money to make the problem go away. 
I never in a million years thought you'd want to be in elliot's life. 
So I'm sorry for what I did. 
Mostly I'm sorry I underestimated you. 
Well,you're not half as sorry as I am. 
I think you should go. 
Yeah.I think you should go. 
Kate. 
Are you here?'Cause he really wants to talk to you. 
Spooky.Is that it? 
I bet you feel really stupid now that it turns out the kid isn't even mine,don't you,honey? 
Ask him how he thinks it makes me feel to watch him, a man who told me flat out he didn't want to have children with me, become completely and utterly destroyed over some kid who wasn't even his to begin with. 
She's a little angry at how upset you were when you found out that elliot wasn't yours. 
What's that got to do with us? 
I'll tell you exactly what that's got to do with us, you miserable little. 
I will not repeat that,and,you,calm down. 
Why?What happened?What did she say? 
She's angry. 
because she thinks you didn't want a baby with her. 
Wow.She thinks I didn't wanna have kids with her? 
Kate,I--that's not what I said at all. 
 Yes,you did,repeatedly. 
 And I never once made this about you or about me,  and you wanna think that I'm selfish. 
 "One more year. 
We have so much time,and look what that got--" . 
child,elliot,and you wanna think that you're suffering. 
 I'm the one that's suffering. 
 You have no idea how much. 
You don't even know the damn truth! 
All right,enough! 
She started it. 
I didn't get any of that,nor did I want to, but I did hear you say something about him not knowing the truth. 
When we were trying to... 
when I thought he wanted children as much as I did. 
we were doing in vitro,fertility injections,and. 
were you gonna tell me,rick? 
I need a little more here. 
The dean called. 
Your grant's been approved. 
2 years in peru when we're trying to get pregnant, and you didn't tell me. 
Move over. 
Come on. 
Look,I am nowhere near ready to have a child now,ok? 
But we've very young. 
We have lots of time.We have 
all the time in the world,so... 
it's ok. 
Professor payne. 
Sure. 
It's the fertility clinic. 
I know all this. 
They called. 
They said her eggs were not viable, and she accused me of being relieved. 
We fought.Blah,blah,blah. 
I lied. 
The doctor said we were good to go. 
That was my one chance to get pregnant, but because I knew he didn't want it. 
I lied. 
Few weeks later,I was dead. 
What is it? 
She lied. 
She lied to you because she thought you didn't want children. 
The doctor said it was a good time. 
She thought it was her only chance. 
I didn't know. 
If she lied,why is she mad at me? 
I'm angry because you knew I wanted children. 
and you said you wanted that,too. 
Then every time I brought it up, you just pushed me away. 
But that didn't make it stop. 
Even now,it. 
I know it's not possible,so why does the ache only get worse? 
It hurts so much. 
How can you make that go away? 
I can'T. 
But you have to move on now. 
I mean,you know that. 
You know I can'T. 
Kate,please don't go. 
oh,my god. 
What is it? 
Well,kate told me about her death, but listen to this old article. 
"A construction crane plummeted 8 stories " at a brookside office complex late yesterday morning, "crushing to death a motorist who was making a u-turn, "the victim later identified as katherine payne. 
Payne died moments before her body was freed. 
" That is awful. 
How random. 
Just making a u-turn. 
Hi. 
I'm sorry just to show up like this. 
 No.No. 
 No. 
What's goin' on? 
Go on. 
I took this from professor payne. 
My mom wants you to give it back to him for me and. 
tell him I'm sorry. 
Look,I may not be the world's best role model, but I'm trying to raise an honest kid here. 
No.You know what? 
maybe you should do this yourself in person. 
Pretty sure ricky never wants to see me again. 
I think you might be surprised. 
Are you crazy? 
I told you I never wanna see her again. 
That's why I put you in a moving car before I told you. 
Why don't you just waterboard me instead? 
Wait a minute. 
This is where kate died. 
I hate this place. 
Why would you bring me here? 
Trying to kill 2 birds with one ghost.Come on. 
Well,thanks. 
What is it? 
The fox fetish is in there. 
I took good care of him just like you said. 
You took it from me without asking? 
Yeah. 
I'm...I'm sorry. 
I just thought it'd keep my mom and me safe. 
Ok. 
I thought you'd be here. 
Seems like I'm always here. 
There's this constant pull. 
I...it's because this is 
where your time was cut short. 
You know,I don't normally reward thievery,young man, but I'm gonna make an exception. 
I want you to do me a favor,elliot. 
I want you to take this box, and I want you to keep it, because that way, you'll always know that somebody's lookin' out for you and your mommy,ok? 
 Damn him. 
 All right. 
Listen,go,uh... 
why don't you go wait in the car or somethin'. 
I have to talk to your mom,ok? 
Thank you,professor. 
Well,if I felt stupid before, I really feel stupid now. 
He really got accepted to archfield academy? 
Yeah. 
Yeah.That much is true. 
That's good. 
That's good. 
I'm proud of him,and I'm still paying for it. 
You don't have to do that,ricky. 
I know.That's why I'm doing it. 
And for the record,after that first night, I wasn't gonna go through with it, but then you just surprised me. 
And I started wishing it was true. 
My grandma used to say,"wish again, 'cause you got bad luck on that last one. 
There's another reason why you keep getting dra here. 
Wn I think it's what you're really mad about. 
You wanted more time,and you were mad at him, because he always promised that there would be more. 
It's not his fault. 
Well,I don't have to guess who you're talking to,do I? 
Hello,kate. 
Hi. 
She says hi. 
I don't want you to be mad at me,but I... 
I can't stand the thought of that little boy not getting what he needs, whether he's my son or not. 
She doesn't seem angry. 
I'm sorry the guy I was didn't wanna have kids. 
It's 'cause I was selfish. 
I just wanted you all for myself. 
Think I needed to believe that elliot was my son,because. 
I don't have you anymore. 
I'm sorry I didn't forgive you. 
I forgive you. 
But I couldn't before,because I wasn't ready to let you go. 
Oh,crap. 
 You see it,don't you? 
 Yeah. 
It's magnificent. 
Tell him I said I still love him. 
and I think he'll make a wonderful father someday. 
I promise. 
Good-bye,rick. 
Tell him he should put his ring in the sock drawer. 
That way,when he opens it, he'll think of me every now and again. 
Hey,mel.I'm home. 
You've got the.wedding china out.What's,uh... 
what's the occasion? 
Just celebrating life. 
That's all. 
Look,I'm sorry about today. 
I...I'm not mad if that's 
 what this is about. 
 No. 
It's not,not at all.I... 
was just thinking about what you said,and you're right. 
I mean. 
we never know what's gonna happen. 
Wait a minute. 
Are you saying what I think you're saying? 
Let's have a baby. 
Uh,look,don't do this just for me. 
 I'm... 
 no. 
It's for us. 
Life is too short. 
You know?What the hell are we waiting for? 
Oh,god,I love you. 
I love you. 
Don't answer it. 
Oh,no.It's carl. 
I told him to come by. 
 He wanted to  ok. 
 All right.I'm 
all right. 
Look,I'm gonna go in the shower. 
Hold this whole. 
 hey. 
 Hi. 
Uh,look,I'm sorry. 
This is it,everything I could find on your father, which isn't much. 
Sorry I couldn't find more. 
Are you ok? 
Um,sorry. 
It's chilly tonight. 
Here. 
What are these numbers? 
I don't know.Must have pulled an old file folder. 
It's not my handwriting. 
Carl,I just saw you write them down. 
I'm sorry,mel.I have no idea 
what you're talkin' about. 
Good night. 
Good night. 
I just got off the phone with one of my sources over at Keeler's headquarters. 
Sherry was there meeting privately with Keeler. 
Meeting Keeler about what? 
He didn't know. David 
I came here because I can guarantee you a win in November. 
David Palmer is an accessory to murder. 
David lied to the Chief of Police last night in order to provide an alibi for me. 
Why are you lying to me? 
I screwed up earlier. 
The SAT transmission on my system was forged by my own people. 
Making a mistake is one thing. 
Covering it up is another. 
I can't let you stay in place. 
I am taking over command of CTU now. 
I made a mistake, Jack No, Tony You made two I am going to let you speak to your husband Tell him that you are ok and you are being treated well. 
Are you all right? 
I am fine Don't let them do this, don't let?? 
If Jane is not release when I order it, your wife dies. 
That's all you need to know. 
Are we clear? 
From this point on, I am assuming control of CTU. 
Tony Almeida has stepped down. 
We are taking Jane Saunders to Division. 
Here's the order. 
 We are leaving right now. 
 Ok Going out this way right here. 
Where are all the guards? 
We don't need those guards anymore. 
Jack, Tony locked me in here Saunders has Michelle, he's using her as leverage to get his daughter out. 
This is Almeida. We are out. I have got her 
I will give you further instructions in 20 minutes. 
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida The following takes place between 10:00 am and 11:00 am. 
Excuse me Chloe, I want you to pull up all the surveillance tape from every exit in this building. 
I want you to focus on the last 10 minutes. 
Adam, have you linked up with traffic surveillance yet? 
I'm working on top chance. 
Jack, I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders out of the building without authorization. 
 That's right  Why? 
Saunders has Michelle. 
He wants to trade her for his daughter. 
Jane Saunders is the only leverage we have. 
Trust me, Chase. I know that. 
I got him. He left the building 3 minutes ago, 
and drove off the premises 90 seconds later. 
Adam, he's in a silver SUV. 
Chase, I want you to prep the tactical team. 
 Be ready to move as soon as I give you an order. 
 All right. 
I got him, Jack He's on 5th about half a mile from here, heading east. 
I will call you from the car. 
Son of a bitch Are you ok? 
It's just traffic. 
You have been acting all wired since we left. 
Yeah, well, there's a lot going on right now. 
You never really explained why you wanted to transfer me to this division place. 
I told you. 
I know what you told me. It doesn't make sense. 
Yeah, well, I don't have the time to explain it to you right now. 
Almeida got my daughter out of CTU. 
You need to be ready to move the moment I tell you. 
When are you calling Almeida with instructions? 
15 minutes. I will be with Fredrick. 
At least 700 people are dead or dying in the Chandler Plaza Hotel because Saunders released a weaponized virus into the ventilation system What the media is reporting is a cover story. 
They are deflecting the truth to avoid mass panic. 
You will be infected along with everyone else No matter what he's paying you, it's not worth losing your life Jack is in pursuit of Tony. Move out 
as soon as we get a location on Saunders. Understand? 
Good  Kim  Yeah What are you doing? 
I am working with a team that's monitoring my father. 
I thought you were setting up a tactical unit. 
Yeah, I am We have to wait until we get a location on Saunders. 
Until then, we are pretty much on standby. 
 All right  Listen Before I have to go back out there, I want to talk to you. 
About what? 
About us I need to know whether there's going to be an us. 
Look, I have been thinking about it a lot, and... 
the baby changes everything. 
It doesn't change the way I feel about you. 
Look, let's forget about me for a second. 
You have a daughter and a job that won't let you be with her. 
Is that you talking, or your father? 
My dad would be the first one to admit it. 
He wasn't the greatest dad. 
And it wasn't because he didn't love me. 
I know he loved me. 
It was because of his job If I transferred out of Field Ops, would you consider staying with me? 
I want to stay with you, and I would raise a child with you, Chase. 
I just won't raise one for you Adam, is he still on 5th street? 
No, I lost him He must have turned between Jarvis and Hill. 
Widen the search I am Ok, Jack, I have got him He's going south on Vine, 2 blocks below Hill  You can save some time by... 
 Ok, I got it He's hit traffic at Fillmore. 
You might be able to intercept on Grant. 
Look, I know you are lying to me I know you are not taking me to division. 
You will be fine, Jane. All right? 
At least tell me where we are going Where are you taking me? 
Back to your father My father? 
Why? 
He's holding my wife hostage, and he will kill her if I don't take you back to him So, basically, you are kidnapping me. 
I am sorry After everything he's done, how can you be sure he'll do what he says? 
How do you know he won't kill your wife, anyway? 
I don't have a choice. 
I wish I did, but I don't Tony, put that gun on the dash Put that gun on the dash, now! 
Slowly get out of the car Jane, stay where you are, everything is going to be fine. 
Saunders has Michelle. 
I know He wants to make a trade, Michelle for his daughter I know. I can't let that happen 
Look, I almost lost her once today, Jack I am not losing her again. 
Tony, listen to me I understand exactly how you are feeling. 
I have been there. 
And you handled it just like me, you kept everyone outside of it. 
Tony, this is different. 
Millions of lives are at stake Oh, rules apply to other people But not to you, right, Jack? 
Tony, just calm down, ok? Come on 
You help me make this trade, I will turn myself in. 
Go to prison, whatever is gotta happen. 
I can't do it We need Jane to lure her father in. 
Even if it means Michelle's gotta die. 
Michelle doesn't have to die. 
We can string Saunders along. 
I need you to start working with me Chase has already got a strike team mobile. 
No, no, no, no Saunders sees I brought CTU into this, he kills Michelle He's not going to know we are there. 
Tony, where are you meeting him? 
Tony, you don't have a choice right now You've got to work with me on this Where is the meeting? 
Come on, where are you meeting him? 
He wants me to be at a public pay phone at the corner of Taylor and Vine in 5 minutes. 
He'll give me further instructions from there. 
Thank you You are doing the right thing The quarantined areas are circled in red Now, as far as we know, we have containment. 
We are still not certain? 
No. But we can't really be certain for hours. 
Maybe days. 
David, listen The press is breathing down Gerry's neck pretty hard. 
Now, he thinks we should release a statement. 
I already have. 
I have closed down public transportation and I have told the people to stay in their homes. 
We have F18s patrolling the skies. 
Yeah, but we haven't revealed the exact nature of this threat and the press is picking up on that. 
We have 10 million people spread out over 4000 square mile area. 
If even a small percentage decide to leave at the same time, it will ignite a public panic beyond anything we could control. 
The right thing to do is to withhold the truth until we are sure the virus is contained. 
I will tell Gerry to hold off on the press as long as he can. 
Mr. President 
Yes, Jeannie. 
Senator Keeler's here to see you Have him brought in Yes sir. 
Hello, John Mr. President 
Please take a seat Thank you. I will stand 
You can imaging my surprise when I was told that you wanted to see me. 
Are you withdrawing from the race? 
Mr. President, 
with respect to the death of Alan Milliken, I know you lied to the police. 
Excuse me? 
You obstructed the investigation of a capital crime. 
That's a baseless charge, John. 
Though I have come to expect this kind of recklessness from you No, sir, it's neither baseless nor reckless. 
This is a photograph of the nitroglycerine medicine that would have saved Milliken's life. 
If it hadn't been kept from him You told the police Sherry was with you at the time of Milliken's death. 
Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle prove otherwise. 
Now... 
the last thing this country needs is to have its President... 
dragged through the mud for complicity in a murder Why are you showing me this, John? 
What do you want? 
Your resignation. 
Not immediately, of course. 
But once this crisis you are dealing with is over, you can resign with whatever face saving reason you want to give. 
Get out of here. 
I am offering you the chance to leave office with honor to control how your legacy is written. 
It's a good deal, David You should take it He's going to call in one minute. 
I should go to the phone Ok, as soon as Saunders tells you where he wants he exchange to take place, you need to reject the location. 
We need to force him into picking a secondary location so Chase has time to embed his teams. 
If I don't show up where and when Saunders wants me to, he's going to kill Michelle. 
Not as long as we have his daughter. 
What if he doesn't go for it? 
Don't give him a choice. 
You have got some leverage here, Tony, use it. 
All right. I need to go. 
My father kidnapped his wife because of me? 
Something like that. 
And now you want to use me as bait to get to him. 
We are going to do whatever we have to to stop your father from releasing this virus. 
Stay here. We'll be right back 
Where are we meeting? 
First, let me speak with my daughter. 
No. You can talk to her when we make the exchange. 
All right. 
Bring her to an industrial pack 3 miles north of where you are, on Maltin Road. 
A car will be waiting at loading dock 22. 
Choose a new place. That doesn't work 
Make it work You have got 10 minutes to get to the industrial park or your wife will die. 
If we meet there, we all die. 
Really? 
CTU has redundant satellite surveillance of that area. 
They are dedicating all their resources to finding me right now If you want your daughter back safely, you pick a new spot. 
I am not negotiating terms, Mr. Almeida. 
I have planned too long and too hard for this day and I will do whatever it takes to make sure nothing interferes. 
Even... 
even if it means sacrificing my daughter. 
You need to understand my commitment, Mr. Almeida 
What the hell are you doing? He wasn't going for it. 
He is testing you. He's heard what you had to say. 
He'll phone back. Now hang up the phone. 
How you know? 
Because right now he thinks I am going to kill his daughter. 
The only reason why he exposed himself is to make sure she's still safe. 
Maybe that's what you'd do, Jack But you are not Saunders. 
No matter how well you think you know this guy, you are not him. 
This isn't a game, Jack We are talking about my wife. 
Michelle's got a better chance of surviving if we control the ground where the exchange is supposed to take place. 
But protecting her is not your priority, is it? 
If she were to get killed, that would be an acceptable loss, wouldn't it? 
My god, Jack, Didn't you learn anything from what happened to Terry? 
Shut up, Tony Shut up Tony Just because you sacrificed your wife for this job doesn't mean I am going to sacrifice mine. 
I am here Make no mistake This is your first and your last accommodation. 
Just tell me where you want to make the exchange. 
Downtown, under the 6th street bridge. 
Under the 6th street bridge. 
Be there in 30 minutes But if I see that you have brought anyone else into this, I will kill your wife. 
You did great Tony Almeida's going to make the exchange, but until we get confirmation that Saunders is on site, we stay invisible. 
I will assign positions on the way out. Let's go. 
What is it? 
Satellite pictures of 6th street bridge. 
I asked for a real time feed, Kim We will have it, too, by the time we are on site. 
What about air support? 
We are coordinating with the Marines. 
They will move on your order. 
They will move on your order. 
Look, Chase, please be careful Look, Chase, please be careful Don't worry about me. I will be fine. 
Chloe, how much time before you can setup a real time satellite feed for the 6th street bridge? 
Do you really think Chase is going to quit field ops to start a family? 
He won't I don't know where you are getting this from, but it's none of your business. 
I have known Chase for 3 years. 
You have been dating him for 3 months. 
And your point being? 
He might be a great guy, but he's just like your father They are both the same person. 
So if you are expecting him to leave this for the suburbs, you should revise your expectations. 
When can you uplink a satellite feed? 
10 minutes Then do it I am just trying to be a friend, Kim. That's all 
Hello You have gone too far this time, Sherry You know, I thought I might be hearing from you, David You sent Keeler over here to blackmail me into giving up my presidency? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down You mean Keeler paid you a visit? 
You know damn well he did and you know why Only one person could have given him that prescription bottle and that's you Ok, supposing that was true. 
What then? 
You should go to jail for murder. 
You should go to jail, too, David You lied to the police. 
You told them that I was with you all night Withholding evidence, obstruction of justice. 
Those are serious crimes I knew you always wanted to go down in the history books, David. 
But I am not certain like this. Am I right? 
What did Keeler offer you, Sherry? 
Exactly what you should have offered me, respect and a seat at the table, but instead you called me up when you needed me and then after I did your little dirty work, You threw me out like an old pair of shoes. 
You know me, Sherry, better than anyone, and you know I won't be bullied. 
So before this goes too far, you better ask yourself a question. 
Are you willing to go to jail? 
You know, David, I have asked myself that a million times and the answer is yes, I am willing to go to jail The question is, are you? 
I didn't think so. 
I want the strike teams split into 2 groups Group A can take cover here, group B back here. 
I want them briefed and ready to go as soon as we get there. 
If Saunders sees anyone other than Tony or his daughter, he's not going to make the approach. 
What's the response time for air support? 
30 seconds, after I give the order. 
I will relay the coordinates. 
I will see you at the bridge. 
You got it I know my father released the virus in the hotel that people died. 
But do you really think he'll do what he's saying? 
Release it all over the country? 
If we don't stop him, yes. 
Why? 
There has to be a reason he's doing all of this When I worked with your father, he dedicated himself to saving the lives of innocent people. 
Something has happened to him I don't know what But now he believes our government's betrayed him Is he right? 
There's no easy answer to that. 
The work that your father did often demanded that he make seemingly impossible sacrifices. 
Whatever happened to your father in Bosnia was obviously a sacrifice he wasn't willing to make. 
I am sorry No Shut up! No one can hear you. 
No Shut up now No No! Oh God 
I said stop, stop screaming Look at me, I have been infected. 
Help me, help me, help me�� Help We got a problem here What's going on? 
She has it She has the virus What are you talking about? 
She's bleeding, she must have caught it at the hotel They wouldn't have release her without testing her It's a trick She did it to herself Kevin, are you there? 
Kevin All right, take the east corridor Stop her from getting aboveground But do not shoot to kill (No Service) CTU, O'Brian It's Michelle Hello? 
Chloe, can you here me? 
Whoever this is, I have a really a bad connection. 
I have got a lot of stuff to do right now Chloe So what did Keeler want? 
My job He has proof that Sherry was at Alan Milliken's tonight What? 
What, what proof? 
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up with Sherry's fingerprints on it. 
How did he get a hold of this? 
How do you think? 
Sherry I talked to her a few minutes ago. 
She didn't even bother to deny it David, she's got to be bluffing I mean, if this gets out, she goes to jail. 
So will I She figures I have more to lose than she does And she's right What does Keeler want you to do? 
Withdraw from the race for whatever reason I choose. 
The party gets thrown into chaos, whoever takes my place won't have a prayer in the election, and Keeler becomes President. 
Oh, my god This is all my fault Hey, look We both made mistakes I am the one who called Sherry There may be a way out of this How Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right? 
What are you suggesting? 
That we take away the only leverage she has. 
You mean, steal evidence. 
My god, Wayne Before you say no, you just think about this, ok? 
Now, I can call Foxton, and he can make this all disappear. 
All you have to do is give me the ok  Stay with her  Yes, sir. 
Is your strike team in place? 
2 minutes, they will be ready You sure they will be of sight? 
They will be invisible, Tony Ok I am gonna back Tony up here at the 6th street bridge. 
We should get in position now. 
Jack, priority call from Kim This is Jack Dad, I got Michelle on the line Is she with Saunders No, she said she get away from him. 
Patch her through Hold on Michelle, go ahead I got away from Saunders, but he's still after me Michelle, it's me. Where are you? 
Wilshire, a block east of Olive Chase, send your strike team in now. 
Chase, don't What are you talking about? 
Michelle, I want you to listen to me very carefully I want you to let Saunders catch you again. 
What, are you crazy? 
We have to let the exchange go down It's the only way we are gonna catch him You want me to give myself up? 
Yes, the exchange site is secure, I will send our people in as soon as we know he's there. 
 Chase, redirect your people now.That's an order. 
 Chase, don't! 
Jack, stay out of this You are not in command here Get him out of here, now Jack, Jack, that's my wife, Jack You son of a bitch It's my wife Jack We need this exchange to go through Everything depends on it, do you understand me? 
Michelle, if he doesn't have you for trade, he won't go through with the meeting Look, we are not going to get another chance at it Do you understand, Michelle Yes We are gonna do everything we have to to make sure you come out of this ok But we have got to move now Let's get our teams into position And I thought your brother was the kind of politician who would never lower himself to my level I need to recover something that could cause him a great deal of trouble What is it? 
A bottle of medicine was taken from a crime scene. 
Has it been admitted into evidence? 
No. 
It's in the possession of Sherry Palmer, the President's ex-wife I have a pretty good idea where she is right now, and I can partially reconstruct where she's been since she stole it. 
What kind of time frame are we looking at? 
Hours, Foxton, not days. 
Has this operation been authorized by the President? 
What difference does it make? 
You will get your money I am not worried about that, I just need to know who I am working for My brother knows what you are doing Not that I don't trust you, but ... 
I'd like to hear it from him Fine That's proof enough Let's go Chase and his men have Saunders yet? 
No one's coming yet Look, Jack, promise me you won't make a move on Saunders until Michelle is safe. 
We are going to move as soon as we have got a visual on Saunders, Tony That's the way it's got to go I know I am just asking you to do what you can You know I will We have got 3 cars headed in from the west Tony, they are coming. Are you ready? 
Yeah The windows are tinted. I can't see inside. 
Yeah Give her the phone My preference is to turn you over to your husband unharmed But I will kill you if anything goes wrong Yeah When I see my daughter, you will get your wife All right Jane, I need you to get out of the car Ok, everything is going to be ok I want you to walk over to your father's men Where's my father? 
We don't know Listen, we have to do this, Jane I am sorry Look, Jane, you have got to trust me on this Please go. Come on 
Jack, send your men in now. 
We don't have a visual on Saunders. 
I repeat we don't have a visual on Saunders I can't  Hey, come here  Jane, no, turn around Jane, it's ok, come here Team A and B move We've got a visual on Saunders. 
Move now Stephen I am pinned down Saunders has a helicopter Call in air support now I repeat, call in air support now We need air support I have got a flight of 2 US Marine F18s Just off the marine. 
Call sign Guardian Angel Copy that Guardian Angel, Guardian Angel, this is Watchdog. 
We've got a hot on to victor bravo tango Jack, the Marines are coming in. 
Take cover, I repeat, take cover. 
Chopper's been taken out You ok? 
Don't move 11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for. 
Where are they? 
It's not going to be that simple, Jack Stephen, it's over No, it's not, Jack It's just the beginning Where are the vials? 
You can waste time trying to break me and kill millions of people Or you can give me what I want. 
This is Jack Bauer Saunders is in custody. 
they're what's left over of old roads,alleyways, they're what's left over of another town--underground. 
Dad! 
You're alive. 
It has to do with paul eastman. 
You sent him to prison,only he escaped. 
I've put a lot of people in jail, and none of them have come after me. 
What if he's hiding from someone, someone who he sent to prison? 
What if he's just lying to protect me? 
The man killed a little boy. 
He escaped during a prison fire. 
Facial burn victims wear a clear mask during treatment. 
Paul eastman is dead. 
He possessed my dad. 
He's just trying to get his revenge. 
I have to warn my dad. 
Dad?! 
Oh,my god! 
Tom gordon! 
Tom,we're coming in. 
It's a gunshot victim. 
What are his vitals? 
Tom,can you hear me? 
tom? 
I had to. 
I had to protect her,I had to. 
Try to be quiet. 
 It's all right. 
 I had to. 
Hey,hi. 
Your father's in critical condition, and the next 24 hours are key. 
How could he be alive? 
I saw him,I saw his head. 
Cold feet. 
He had the gun right against his temple, but he moved his hand just as he fired. 
Maybe he changed his mind at the last second. 
Now the bullet had lodged under the scalp, but it didn't penetrate the skull. 
So he made it through surgery quick and easy. 
Now all we have to do is watch and wait. 
Yeah. 
It's all right. 
Hey,thanks a lot,doc. 
You got it.Just page me if you need me, 
cause you know I never really leave this place. 
 Hey. 
 Why would he do this? 
I mean,he must have been possessed. 
Look,before we brought him in, he said something to me. 
He told me he did this to protect you. 
Protect me? 
From what? 
Or who. 
Paul eastman? 
No,he's haunting my father. 
Why would he be a threat to me? 
Maybe that's a question for dear old dad. 
Hey. 
I don't really know if you can hear me, but they told me maybe you could. 
Look,dad,I'm--I'm really confused. 
I don't know. 
I don't know what you're supposed to mean to me. 
I mean,you leave us when I'm 9,. 
and then you just come back. 
No explanation,nothing. 
I don't really know what you think about me. 
Or what I really think about you. 
So it's a really bad time to die,ok? 
Because there's so much that we need to know about each other. 
About everything. 
Sorry. 
There was a line out the door. 
I have been doing things like this all day! 
Hey,hey,don't worry about it. 
But just don't try to pick it up. 
I'm gonna get a broom. 
Are you ok? 
Yeah,yeah,whatever. 
Hey,how is your dad? 
Uh,resting comfortably or so they say, and if that's true,he's the only one. 
What the hell is going on? 
It's a long story,but I think my dad's being haunted by this man he sent to prison. 
,an innocent man Haunted how? 
I think this ghost just figured out a way to possess people for a few minutes, or at least long enough to get them to do the things he wants done. 
Like your dad killing himself? 
Yeah,that's one theory. 
This does not taste like green tea. 
Yeah,because you took mine. 
Oh.Sorry. 
What I don't understand is why now? 
I mean,why would paul eastman wait 30 years to get vengeance? 
Are you asking me like you actually expect an answer? 
Yeah,well,you know what,you work on that for a while,and I'm gonna go get us some new glasses. 
You know what,you need a break. 
We really should go next week and see the tall ships come into the harbor at piermont,ok? 
You mean do something fun? 
I have no training for that. 
It's settled! 
We are going. 
Ghost Whisperer Season03 Episode18  Paul? 
Paul eastman? 
You don't really think this stuff scares me,do you? 
Well,fear is a relative thing,I've always found. 
I know that you've been possessing my father. 
I know that you want revenge. 
You blame him for sending you to prison. 
Tip of the iceberg. 
He tried to kill himself just to get rid of you. 
He thinks you're trying to hurt me. 
I know that you're the one that's been haunting me in my dreams. 
Why don't you just leave him alone? 
Give me your best shot. 
It's touching that you believe your father to be so noble. 
No,never said he was noble, but I do believe that everyone deserves forgiveness. 
He didn't set out to hurt you. 
Your father didn't try to kill himself to save you; he did it because I made him. 
I put that gun to his head myself. 
But he's strong,I'll give him that. 
He saved himself. 
You really do hate him. 
There are few who deserve hatred more than that man. 
You have no idea. 
So tell me. 
I don't think I will. 
And I don't think you'll believe me. 
Try me. 
Every journey begins with the first step. 
Mom. 
What are you doing here? 
Nice to see you,too. 
Why haven't you been answering your phone? 
'Cause then I'd have to talk to whoever's calling. 
That's clear. 
Cold,but clear. 
How's the new shop? 
I like working with flowers. 
They're beautiful,they smell nice. 
And when they die,they don't come back with complaints. 
Ok then. 
I'm not discussing your father. 
Who says this is about him? 
Maybe it's about something else altogether. 
 Is it? 
 No,it's about dad. 
I am not discussing your father. 
Fine,let me talk then. 
I found out that he prosecuted a man named paul eastman for murder, only he was innocent,and his ghost is back trying to get revenge. 
This is sounding a lot like a conversation about your father. 
Did you know paul eastman? 
I mean,did dad ever talk about him? 
Why don't you ask him? 
Well,he's got his hands full right now. 
You know,bullet in the head and all that? 
Not that you'd care. 
It wasn't life-threatening. 
It didn't even get past the scalp. 
So you checked on him? 
One phone call. 
Look,melinda,I don't mean to sound hard-hearted about this, but your father is not a good person. 
He's not misunderstood. 
He's just plain bad. 
You need to accept that. 
He doesn't deserve your good intentions. 
He doesn't even. 
I left the door unlocked. 
I have to get back. 
I'm sorry. 
I cannot help you. 
You have to look at the big picture here. 
You can't just get caught up in where you are right now, although that is the trap that we all seem to get caught up in. 
You know,it's where am I, where am I going,what's going to happen. 
These are--hello?! 
You know,you should really be taking notes on this,my little friend. 
I know you are not talking to that gerbil. 
His name is bob,by the way,and,you know, I don't even know why I bother with this guy. 
It's in one little ear,out the other with him. 
How's your dad? 
Stable,which is more than I can say for me. 
Well,stability's overrated. 
I wouldn't know. 
Anyway,do you remember paul eastman, the guy who was haunting my father? 
No,but if you hum a few bars. 
He's not only haunting him,he's possessing him. 
You know,like making him do all kinds of things,I don't know,trying to kill himself. 
Well,the dead are really getting the hang of this. 
That can't be good news for the living. 
Yeah,and I've already talked to eastman, and he hates my father with a passion, so I don't even know if I'm going to be able to turn this guy around. 
And by the way,I found eastman's bones buried in the basement of a house that his ghost led me to. 
That's quite a "by the way" you just laid on me. 
Did anything ordinary happen to you in the past few days? 
Um,no. 
I didn't think so. 
Any ideas? 
Well,no one's bones are found buried in someone's basement if they died a nice,happy,peaceful death. 
I think he was murdered and he wants you to solve it. 
No,that's too simple. 
I mean,he would have laid all that out for me first thing. 
Whatever it is,he knows the answer,and he wants me to figure out the mystery for myself. 
Why? 
Because he said that I wouldn't believe him if he tried to tell me If that's for me,I already left. 
Hello? 
Hey,I found something in the archives. 
That house you were in,where you found the bones. 
you know that house. 
No,I don'T. 
Yeah,you do. 
They might have changed the name on the street,but you know it. 
How? 
The name on the original deed is thomas and beth gordon. 
It was your parents' first home. 
What?�� 
Honey,it's the house you were born in. 
bones? 
As in a skeleton in the basement of the house you and dad owned. 
That could have been there for a hundred years,for all you know. 
Nice try. 
Ok,the bones belong to that man that dad sent to prison,paul eastman. 
He was the one that led me there, and you're gonna act like you don't know what I'm talking about? 
What difference does it make? 
You never believe me anyway. 
Why should I? 
You never tell me the truth. 
Then don't ask. 
Just leave me in peace. 
Peace is not an option noright All right? 
Sooner or later,the police are going to get involved. 
It happened at your house,they're coming to you. 
You be may be implicated in a murder! 
Melinda,I know you don't have much respect for what I say, but I am asking you this one time to listen to me leave this alone. 
There is no good for anybody at the end of this road. 
Yeah,that's the difference between you and me. 
I can't live with a lie. 
You would be surprised at what you can learn to live with. 
I didn't recognize anything in the basment. 
It's really changed. 
Well it's abandoned now. 
You want to go inside? 
No. 
Too many bad memories? 
Too many memories,period. 
Now I've searched every online news site. 
Paul eastman escaped from prison and was never heard from again. 
Right. 
Until he shows up as a skeleton in the house where you and your parents used to live. 
It's crazy. 
What is it? 
I don't know. 
I-I just don't know what I'm supposed to do next. 
You know,I. 
I just have this really bad feeling. 
Like when I was a little girl waiting on my dad to do the right thing. 
You know,or trying to figure out how to understand him. 
And I just keep getting hurt, and then he walks away. 
You know,I hate to say this, but maybe your mother's right. 
Maybe it's time for you to cut him out of your life, the way he cut you out of his. 
I wish I could. 
But I'm not him. 
I gotta get back to the store,  I'll see you later.  Ok. 
 Yeah? 
 Hey,jim,dr.Farrington, 
just giving you a head's up in case the hospital hasn't called. 
Tell melinda that her dad is conscious and talking. 
Yeah. 
I'll do that. 
Sorry,I'm just a little dizzy. 
Hey,boss,do you mind,uh,this is my father-in-law. 
Do you mind if we,uh, take a walk to my-- thanks a lot. 
Jim clancy. 
I heard so much about you. 
It's if I knew you. 
You don't know me,tom. 
You know nothing about me. 
Come on. 
You know,unlike melinda, I got nothing invested in you,zero. 
You're just the guy who's put my wife through a world of pain. 
She'd be much better off if you never took another breath. 
I almost obliged,didn't I? 
Yeah,but you missed. 
And then you tell me you did it to protect her? 
I'm having trouble believing that. 
I misspoke. 
Do not mess with melinda's head. 
I won't have that. 
I've always had to stand by, watch her tossed around and hurt by things I don't understand, but you. you'll understand. 
I don't think you do. 
Oh,I think so. 
And I think you're gonna start telling me the truth, or I'm gonna come back here when you are sound asleep in your room, and I'm gonna cut some very important tubes and watch you die for real,tom. 
But jim. 
you're sworn to save lives. 
Comes out a roaring second compared to saving my wife. 
It all goes back to paul eastman. 
He spent 9 years in prison,then he escaped. 
Came to find me,actually beth and me and melinda. 
The thing is,prison didn't agree with him. 
He was demented,and he wanted revenge. 
He was going to kill my wife and daughter. 
And me,too. 
Could have done a lot of things. 
I could have called the cops. 
Could have drove his body to the mountains and dumped it. 
I wanted to keep him right there. 
I wanted to always know where he was. 
Wanted to keep this in the family. 
You were the assistant district attorney. 
Why didn't you call the police? 
It seems like a pretty clear case of self defense. 
Maybe. 
But it would have been a big media story. 
And how would melinda have processed all this? 
She was 9. 
What if she got harassed about it at school, or had reporters following her? 
So you see,just like you,my friend, burying a body came in a roaring second to protecting my family. 
Oh,yeah. 
Is that why you left them right after that? 
There's never only one reason for these things. 
The important thing both of us have to remember is this paul eastman still wants to kill me. 
from the grave. 
The problem with that is? 
I don't expect anybody to cry any tears over me,but he still wants to kill beth, and he still wants to kill melinda. 
And I don't know how to stop him. 
Do you? 
My father admitted to you that he's a killer? 
I know this seems like an episode of father knows best gone horribly wrong, and I am the last guy to defend your dad, but it does look like a case of self defense. 
So I guess we know why paul eastman was haunting him. 
Hey,correction-- haunting you,mel. 
Your dad told me this guy wants to hurt you,your mom,and him, and by hurt,I don't mean just push and shove,ok? 
Yeah,I know.I convinced my dad to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger. 
You know,that's what I don't understand. 
Paul eastman,he's a powerful ghost,right? 
So why hasn't he possessed you? 
Why hasn't he really come after you? 
For one,he obviously has things he wants me to find out first. 
Yeah,like what? 
Since I'm still alive,I don't know yet. 
Not a big fan of the gallows humor when it concerns your safety. 
That would have been pretty impressive if it had been bourbon. 
Pinot grigio has a pretty big kick. 
What are you going to do? 
There's only one way to get him to cross over. 
Ok,I think I can make it from here. 
Good enough,thanks. 
I didn't expect you to get out so soon. 
Signed myself out. 
There's too many sick people in that hospital. 
I need you to let me take you to paul eastman. 
Serves no purpose. 
Is it true. 
Was he really going to kill mom and me. 
Just a second. 
Melinda,it's a little late. 
for me to be a hero in your eyes. 
I did what I had to do,that's all. 
I saved myself as well. 
I heard what you said in there. 
When. 
When you came to my hospital room. 
A moment of weakness. 
Understood. 
Am I ever going to find out. 
Find out what. 
Who you are. 
If you ever loved me. 
If you ever loved mom. 
If you love me now. 
Melinda,it's so complicated  no,it really isn'T. 
Everybody always says that,but. 
at the end of the day,it's pretty damn simple. 
Either love is there or isn'T. 
No excuse,no qualifications,no complications. 
Why do you want me to talk to paul eastman. 
I want you to apologize to him. 
I want you to tell him why you did what you did. 
I want you to have closure. 
with at least one person. 
And maybe he'll leave us alone. 
That's the only way any of this is going to end. 
All right.I don't think it's going to help,but if you do,I will. 
I'll come to your shop tonight,and after it's over,we'll talk. 
And I'll tell you everything that you want to know about me,about us. 
No more complications. 
Dad. 
Hey.I was just walking by,I saw the lights on. 
Everything ok. 
Yeah. 
Sorry,I thought you were someone else. 
Who. No one worth talking about. 
Thanks. 
He's gonna hurt her,you know. 
What. 
She has to know. 
It's the only way you can save her. 
And she has to hear it from you. 
Don't let her find out from tom. 
You know what he's capable of. 
She's safer not knowing. 
Not anymore. 
Oh,I hope you have some bourbon and a straw. 
You won't believe the day I had. 
I haven't told you the truth. 
No kidding. 
About what. 
About a lot of things. 
I lied about not knowing paul eastman. 
I was in love with him. 
We were engaged. 
I was living with him when he was arrested. 
Paul and I had been living together for about a year. 
I knew he wasn't guilty of that murder. 
I knew that a ghost had led him to that boy's body. 
But who was going to believe that. 
So you went to the prosecutor. 
that's how you met dad. 
Yes. 
After he was convicted. 
I never expected him to believe me. 
I had to show him the ghost in his own office before he did. 
Where is he. 
Right there,in the corner. 
What's he wearing. 
He's wearing a brown suit,uh,probably from the late 1800s. 
He's got a gray beard,white hair,uh,long,and glasses. 
You just described mr.Mclaughlin. 
This was his office like a hundred years ago. 
Of course,then he did believe me, and he realized it was possible that paul was innocent. 
I told paul that there was hope; that tom was doing everything he could to find evidence to exonerate him. 
Paul was the love of my life. 
When he went to prison,it was like. 
I died inside. 
I didn't want to. 
I tried to fight it,but I started having feelings for tom. 
I thought he was such a good man. 
Paul was going more and more inside himself,and. 
and there was tom gordon. 
Centered,very sure of himself. 
And he cared,or at least he did the best imitation of someone who cared that I'd ever seen. 
How did you tell paul. 
I didn'T. 
How could you not tell him. 
I was confused. 
I felt guilty. 
His letters were getting so angry and bitter. 
I was trying to figure out how to tell him. 
And then he killed a man in prison. 
He was never gonna get out then. 
It was over for him. 
And you married dad. 
I'm not proud of any of this,melinda. 
I'm not judging you,mom,really.I'm not. 
How did paul find you after he escaped from prison. 
He read something in the newspaper about tom's career, and in the article it mentioned me and. 
and that we had a daughter. 
He started a fire. 
Undedhe ep getting badly burned. 
And when he was in the hospital ward,he managed to escape. 
He found us. 
Well,I guess you know the rest. 
Do we know the rest. 
I mean,do we,beth. 
Or are we just going to wait around for you to tell us the next big missing piece in melinda's life. 
Jim,don'T. 
No,you know what,I'm sick of this. 
I am sick of people like you and like her father who should have been protecting her. 
Who should still be watching out for her instead of lying to her. 
I mean,playing mind games with her when she's in danger. 
Jim,this isn't helping. 
Beth,all she ever wanted from you was for you to accept her as she is. 
And maybe from her father,maybe an explanation. 
You know.How do you walk out on a family. 
And for all that,I mean,look at her. 
She still wants to understand. 
She still wants to forgive. 
But every time she opens her heart to you,you stick a knife in it. 
Beth,you ran away from everything you could do in your life. 
My wife runs toward it. 
And for that,she deserves just the littlest bit of respect. 
You know,a little truth. 
I'm sorry. 
Mom,I no.He's right. 
You're right. 
There is another missing piece. 
What. 
When paul was arrested. 
I was pregnant. 
Mom,what are you saying. 
I was pregnant with you. 
Paul eastman is my father. 
You're lying. 
No. 
We didn't tell you. 
We didn't tell anyone. 
Tom wanted you and he wasn't afraid that you might have this thing,this so-called gift. 
You're lying. 
You're lying. 
Is it true. 
Is what true. 
That you're not my father. 
If you say it's complicated,I will kill you right here. 
Your mother's trying to drive a wedge between us. 
You can see that,can't you. 
No one will tell me the truth. 
Come with me,and I will. 
Come with you where. 
A place where you'll be safe. 
Safe.Right. 
Look.I'm sorry. 
I really am. 
This whole thing is such a mess. 
I never meant for you to be involved. 
Not like this. 
Come with me,and you'll understand everything. 
I'm curious,what do you remember about that night,the night paul eastman came here. 
Not much. 
Just his face,with that horrible mask leaning over me.I was scared. 
What else. 
That's all,why. 
Could be important. 
What I remember. 
Why don't you go upstairs and see if your room jogs anything. 
Your bed was right over there. 
You never even heard him come in. 
Did you see him leave. 
No.I just went back to sleep. 
You sure. 
Yeah.Yeah,I. 
that's it. 
The breaking glass,it woke me up. 
And then. 
And then the voices. 
You can't just show up here and What'd you think I'd do,make an appointment. 
I can't help you.There's nothing I can do. 
You know why I'm here. 
I saw all the files. 
All the court records. 
You never lifted a finger to help me. 
Everything thatd ou tol ybeth that you were doing for me,that was all a lie. 
You wanted to keep me in prison. 
Keep your voice down. 
What do you think beth is going to say when she finds out that you hired that other prisoner to kill me, that you wanted me dead so that you could have her all to yourself. 
She'll never believe you,but you do what you have to do. 
I will. 
It's funny how memories mecan co rushing back. 
What are you doing. 
I'm sorry,melinda,but the thing is. 
I just can't let you live now. 
Wait.You knew paul eastman was innocent,and you kept him in jail. 
Innocence is kind of a broad concept at times. 
Besides,your mother wanted me and not some needy,haunted guy. 
So I just. 
made sure he stayed where he belonged. 
But your mother,she's nothing if not devoted. 
She just wouldn'T. 
give up on that guy. 
So you tried to have him killed in prison. 
When they told me that paul killed that guy instead. 
He had more on the ball than I thought he did. 
It was a win-win in any case. 
He was convicted for that murder,too. 
Your mother and I,well,not exactly happily ever after,I guess,but still,it's nice to. 
win. 
So why did you come back here. 
Why wouldn't you just leave me alone. 
Because you had to go and find the underground,wake up paul eastman. 
You know what your problem is,melinda. 
You're just too good for your own good. 
I kept hoping that you would get scared off. 
But you don't scare easily,do you. 
Dad,please.dad. 
Don't call me dad. 
I'm not your father. 
I wasn't talking to you. 
No.No. 
Hey,are you all right. 
Yeah,I'm all right. 
How did you find me.I looked everywhere. 
But then I thought,you're looking for eastman's ghost here,with the bones. 
He's dead. 
You're my father. 
Have you always known. 
After I died,I forgot almost everything about my life. 
It was like I'd become paralyzed,stuck down below with all of the other angry,bitter spirits. 
But then I saw something. 
Something that changed everything. 
It woke me up. 
What. 
You. 
I saw you moving through the church,and I knew instantly. 
I felt that you were from me. 
You were so beautiful. 
The more I watched you,the more I saw how you pined for the man that you thought was your father how you were waiting for him to love you back, and I knew that I could nerve compete with your idea of him, so I had to try and make you destroy that myth yourself. 
You could have told me this so much sooner. 
You would never have believed me. 
This was a journey you had to take on your own.With my help. 
You've spent so much time trying to understand the man who pretended to be your father, you never saw the one person who was right in front of your eyes. 
I've tried. 
But she always pushes me away. 
And she lies about everything. 
She only wanted to protect you. 
That's what mothers do. 
But you've only.looked at her in the shadow of tom gordon. 
But she has always put you first. 
It's time.to make things right. 
Be too good for your own good. 
I don't blame you for hating me. 
Mom,I could never hate you. 
You're busy fighting your own battles. 
You always believed in him.I just didn't see how I could take that away from you. 
Mom,I'm relieved. 
My father didn't abandon me. 
At least not by choice. 
And to know that he would have wanted me if he could have,makes all the difference. 
Somewhere,deep down inside,I always felt like I was disposable. 
Now I don'T. 
Go. 
You never were fond of seeing ghosts,were you. 
I'll make an exception today. 
How can I ever ask you to forgive me. 
I was so full of rage. 
at you and him. 
I just wanted you all to feel as much pain as I did, but that all went away with just one word. 
What. 
"Dad. 
" When my daughter called for me,when she needed me, all the fury went away,and I just wanted to save her. 
If I could do this all over again  I wouldn't change a thing Look at what we created. 
She's the reason we came together. 
Nothing else matters. 
Nothing. 
The light. 
Yeah.It's getting brighter. 
But there's so much that. 
I need to know. 
No.There isn'T. 
You're loved. 
That's all,that's everything. 
And so am I. 
Clean slate. 
Clean slate. 
You know,um,we're all going to watch the tall ships come in. 
Would you like to come. 
Oh,no,you--you go on with your friends. 
It's all right. 
It's friends and family. 
Ok. 
Have I ever told you how proud I am to be your mother. 
You are my mother,right. 
Yes.I am definitely your mother. 
 what. 
That's weird. 
There's six of us,but. 
there's only five shadows. 
No, why did you want me to the basketball game? 
I don't know the difference between a field goal and a slam dunk. 
They don't have field goals in basketball. 
That's football. 
No, basketball, too Oh, jim, why don't you come? 
Ned would love to have you there. 
Ah, i'd love to, but i got the night shift. 
You know? 
Look, i wouldn't ask, Except this is a new school for him, He just transferred in, And i know he would appreciate Seeing a few familiar faces there. 
I'd be happy to come. 
Huh! That's great! 
Oh, he will so thrilled! 
Oh, i hope he gets a touchdown! 
Hey, honey, we're here. 
Yeah, i saw that, mom. 
Did you say hi to melinda? 
Hi, melinda. 
Hi, ned. 
And i have snacks if you're hungry. 
Oh, no. 
Really, i'm ok, mom. 
I know it means a lot to him that we're here. 
I can see that. 
Is that brad? No.34 
I mean, what's the big deal? 
What can he do that you can't do? 
That. 
Way to go, brad! 
Is that his girlfriend? 
Yeah, her name's krista. 
I don't know. 
What happened? 
Ned, what's wrong? 
Brad's points aren't up. 
Something wrong with the scoreboard. 
Maybe she needs help. 
"34 + gf = death." 
What's going on? 
34, that's brad's number. 
So "gf" is gotta be girlfriend, right? 
Yeah, brad and krista are like this uber couple. 
What? 
"Slammers be slammed?" 
Wait, this doesn't have anything to do with that awful slam book? 
What's a slam book? 
It's just this terrible website Where students can anonymously slam each other. It's--Ugh. 
What's going on? 
Delia, get up, go! 
Ok, ned, come on, let's get out of here.Ned... 
Ned, what the hell is going on? 
Tell me more about the slam book. 
It's just a way to hurt people. 
Well, it's working. 
������ �����11�� =�����������= ���룺 ���� 걼��᣺stoneiii  And right before the bleachers closed, The scoreboard said "slammers be slammed." 
Well, it's obviously a ghost Who's a big fan of a jump shot. 
You know, as opposed to slam dunks. 
Nothing? These are 
basketball references. 
Why am i wasting my time? 
Ok, have you ever heard of a slam book? 
Of course i have. 
The internet's wonderful contribution To ruining reputations everywhere. 
Yeah, these kids just create a webpage and tear into each other. 
Everyone can see it. 
You don't even have to sneak into the boy's locker room To find out what they wrote on the wall. 
Not that i ever did that. 
I never did that, either. Ever. 
I never had anything written about me, either, Which is awful. 
Zip, zero, nothing. 
Is there anything worse? 
Yeah, try this "Want milk? 
Try jay baker's man boobs. 
So you think this ghost is lashing out Because of what somebody wrote about it in the slam book? 
Maybe. Especially 
if what was written by brad and krista. 
Hey, morning. 
Hey, professor payne. 
Hey, you two. 
Hey Hey, ned, how are things going at school? 
Weird. 
Why? What happened now? 
Well, the school tnks they have a suspect In that gym incident last night. 
The girl who ran the scoreboard, what was her name? 
Lucy. 
Well, that means it's not a ghost, then. 
Well, it depends on who you talk to. 
The school feels they caught the culprit. 
Ned, on the other hand... 
Lucy's brother died a few weeks ago. 
Yeah, he hit his head skateboarding. 
He seemed fine, and then he just fell asleep. 
Concussions are like that Totally stealth. 
Oh, that is awful. 
And that's exactly why some people think that It makes sense that lucy did it. 
You know, she was upset, understandably. 
Maybe she blames brad and krista Even though her brother's death was an accident. 
What is her brother's name? 
Thomas. Thomas benjamin. 
Well, that's strange. 
There's practically nothing here. 
Just one kid calling him guano boy. 
Whatever that means. 
Where can i find a picture? 
Check the school face page. Here. 
Guano boy's better than nothin'. 
At least he's not invisible. 
Hello? 
Do you guys even hear what i'm saying? 
I don't know if he caused all that stuff With the scoreboard and bleachers, But i know he was there last night. This is the ghost i saw. 
Really? 
Mom. 
What? 
So if it was the ghost, that's good news, right? 
At least for lucy. 
You can tell that ned's a little biased on the subject. 
So lucy's a friend? 
Don't say anything. 
Uh, ned, i take it you don't agree With, uh, britfan20-12 who describes lucy as, quote, "Satan's deadly girl pawn?" 
Whoever wrote that doesn't know her. 
She's really cool. 
You should meet her. 
So then why don't you introduce me? 
Uh, geometry class? 
I sit right behind you. 
Uh, right next to tony neil. 
Spanish 2. 
I sit in the back, over to the left, Uh, by the pencil sharpener. 
I'm sorry, i have no clue. 
Don't take it personally, i'm new at school, ted. 
Ned. 
I'm new, too. 
That's why i thought you might, uh Uh, lucy, i'm melinda. 
Ned told me about your brother, and i'm really sorry. 
Thanks. Um... 
What's this about? 
Well, i was at the gym last night. 
Yeah, look, I already talked to a lot of people about it, so... 
I don't think that you did it. 
I was there at the scoreboard. 
I'm all emotionally messed up about my brother. 
It had to be me, right? 
Well, it's hard to explain, But i'm pretty sure someone else did it. 
Why? 
Do you blame brad and krista for your brother's death? 
It was an accident. 
Why would i blame them? 
Whoever wrote "slammers be slammed" Obviously blames them for something. 
Can i ask you more about your brother? 
I heard that he died in a skateboarding accident. 
He came home that night and put a bag of ice on the back of his head. 
He had his skateboard with him, So i figured he just wiped out again. 
And then he went to sleep and never woke up. 
Do you remember anything else? 
Anything he said? 
Nothing he said. 
But i noticed there was like... 
Chalk on his jacket. 
Like, the kind that they use To write the name of the football team on the field. 
This is gonna sound like a weird question, But were there any bad feelings Between thomas and krista What does the gym thing last night Have to do with thomas? 
He's dead. 
Oh, i get it, ok. 
You say that you don't think that i had anything to with it, but... 
No, it's not like that. 
Why can't everybody just give me a break? 
Lucy! 
Hey. Let her go. 
I'll see you guys in a little bit. 
Oh... 
Aaah! 
Aaah! 
Please, please stop! 
He's harmless! 
Just let him fly away! 
I don't get why we can't tell lucy. 
She'd be so relieved to know that her brother's here. 
For starters, she'd have some answers for everything she's being accused of. 
Yeah, i don't know if she's gonna be relieved, ned. 
It's a lot for one person to handle. 
I handled it when you told me my dad's ghost was here. 
I don't want to tell her about her brother Until i know what he wants. 
Officer: lucy benjamin? 
Yeah? 
Grandview police. 
We need to ask you some questions. 
Who would put a bat in there? 
I mean, who would think of that? 
It was you. 
You're the only one. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Brad: krista, take it easy. 
Why would you do that to me? 
I'm like the only person in this whole school Who's been nice to your brother. 
Why would you do that to me? 
I died becau of you. 
That's why. 
And now you're gonna pay Both of you. 
I just don't get why the cops were there. 
Lucy's not some psycho. 
It's the world we live in now. 
Schools feel like they can't be too cautious. 
Well, does thomas have any idea What kind of trouble he's getting his sister in? 
Well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. 
We just have to find out what he has against those two, And what it has to do with the slam book. 
So what do we do? 
Well, usually i would talk to lucy, But she seems to think i'm just another adult Who wants to blame her for what happened in the gym. 
Who else can we get to talk to her? 
I don't know. 
I mean, this whole thing just Ok, you know what, if you're afraid To have ned get involved with ghosts, Then i understand. 
It's not the ghost i'm afraid of. 
What is it, then? 
Nothing. I'm not 
afraid of anything. 
Me, neither. 
What are you doing here? 
Are you here with your friend? 
No. 
I just--I didn't mean to bother you. 
I just wanted to talk. 
Oh, god, i'm sorry. 
Um... 
I haven't been in the best mood lately. 
I should get going, anyway. 
I'm really sorry about what happened to thoma I shouldn't have... 
said anything. 
No, it's ok. 
It's...messed up 
How you don't really want people to bring it up, And then, if they don't, It's like everybody's already forgotten him. 
Were you two really close? 
He's my big brother. 
We were the only 2 kids in our family. 
He always looked out for me. 
Sometimes more than i wanted him to. 
Yeah. I got a mom 
who's like that. 
Just, i... 
Miss him so much sometimes, you know? 
And all this strange stuff's happening, And making it so much worse. 
Maybe i can help. 
What do you mean? 
Ok, this is gonna sound weird. 
Really wei, but i can't think of a not weird way to say it, So i'm just gonna say it. 
I believe in ghosts. 
And if you go with me, just for a minute, Maybe you can see how you won't have to miss thomas so much. 
Plus, it can help explain All the strange things that's been happening. 
The scoreboard, the bleachers, The bat in krista's car. 
The bat was just somebody's bad idea of a joke. 
Everybody knew thomas was into bats. 
I know it sounds crazy. 
Ok, wait, what What is this? 
Is there a camera somewhere? 
Are you gonna post This whole little talk on your slam book? 
I wouldn't do that. 
Just don't talk to me about my brother again. 
Stay the hell away from me! 
These kids must spend half their waking hours Slamming each other online, and nobody's immune. 
That's one of the popular girls, right? 
Turns out that's not such a blessing anymore. 
I guess it pays to be anonymous on the internet. 
Yeah. Being anonymous 
is part of the problem. 
These kids say things under the cover of a screen name That they would never have the courage to say to someone's face. 
Here we go. 
A slam on krista keeps it concise and to the point. 
"Liar. Two-Faced. 
Phony. Bitch." 
Anyone who sleeps with krista better get tested." 
"You're not kidding. 
Don't forget the rabies vaccine." 
Wow. Rabies. 
Gettin' slammed already for having a bat in her car. 
News travels fast on the internet. 
Yeah, except this was posted last month, Before thomas died. 
And there's a few more mentions of rabies Going back en further. 
You know what, i wonder... 
What's that? 
Krista's school face page. 
Look at the caption. 
"Here's me with a bat house i built with my dad." 
You know, maybe i'm wrong, But i'm guessing bat lovers united Is a very small club. 
Makes you wonder what else they had in common. 
Krista: i can't handle this anymore. 
"It's ok, brad's totally clueless. 
"I mean, what would i tell him anyway? 
I'm crazy about someone who won't even give me their name." 
Signed krista? 
Krista: i can explain. 
Brad. 
And that was sent to every kid at school at the same time? 
Ned: yeah, how is that even possible? 
Well, if i had to guess, i'd guess ghost. 
So what now? 
Well, it seems to imply That krista was cheating on her boyfriend brad. 
Maybe he knew about it. 
I can introduce you to brad. 
I'll be right there. 
Ned. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Where is he? 
Yeah, practice just ended. 
I told him to meet you in the team meeting room. 
I'll see you later. 
Thomas benjamin had chalk on him when he died. 
He was hit in the head with something. 
I'm guessing it was this board. 
You're the one that pushed him into it. 
Brad, i don't work for the school or the police I'm just trying To help thomas and his family get some peace. 
And you, too. 
But you have to tell me what happened. 
Krista had been acting strange for weeks. 
I mean, we spe all our time together, But she was sorta... 
checked out. 
She was always online iming her friends. 
Hey. 
Here's a tip When your girlfriend starts closing your cell phone around you, it's over. 
I really like krista, And i just I didn't want to lose her. 
I had to know who she was seeing. 
I know it was wrong, but i read her email. 
Some of the stuff she was telling this guy was so intense. 
And the weirdest thing was, E didn't even know who he was. 
Then i did something really stupid That i'll regret the rest of my life. 
I sent him an email pretending to be krista. 
I said, "let's meet." 
So you arranged to meet him here? 
I just wanted to know who the guy was. 
I had a right to face my competition, Tell him what krista meant to me. 
Then there was thomas. 
Guano boy. 
Brad: i couldn't believe it. 
Where's krista? 
She doesn't know anything about this. 
I sent the invite. 
Yeah, well, whatever. 
Look, man, i just want to talk. 
Yeah, well, i don't want to talk to you, man. 
You gotta hear me out, man! 
And that's when he blindsided me. 
Ow! 
Are you ok, man? 
What the hell do you care, man?! 
Get off me! 
Brad: and that was it, i swear. 
He seemed fine that night when he left. 
What about krista? 
How does she feel about all of this? 
Like i told thomas She didn't even know i sent the email arranging the meeting. 
It's me who's to blame. 
Quite an entrance. 
Just some friends from a previous life. 
I don't know why they can see me. 
Then again, i don'know why you can see me, either. 
Brad told me what happened the night you died. 
Did he mentioned the part where he killed me? 
He said that you threw the first punch, And that he thought you were ok and it was all an accident. 
What if it was? 
When i left him, he was with the principal, Confessing everything to the authorities. 
He feels terrible. 
Ok, it was all an accident And you have to forgive them and go into the light. 
Forgive them? Why? 
Because everything that you're doing, All these things you're trying to punish them with, These hauntings, it's just hurting your sister. 
She's getting blamed for everything you do. 
Who's blaming lucy? 
Is it the slam book? 
You know how they treat anyone who's different. 
No, the police. 
Ok, the school. 
You were there when they were questioning her. 
Well, they shouldn't be questioning lucy. 
That's the whole point. 
They should just leave her alone. 
Is that why you've been doing all this, Because you think you're protecting her? 
I always have. 
I'm her brother. 
I've got her six. 
Thomas, please tell me what it is that you're protecting her from. 
I can help you. 
No, you can't. 
No one can. 
But if you don't tell me, I'm gonna have to find out myself, And what if i'm too late? 
You stay away from her. 
I'm warning you. 
Why won't you let me help her? 
We all got our secrets. 
Including you. 
Melinda: lucy? 
Can i talk to you for a minute? 
Talk if you want. 
I know ned told you he believes in ghosts. 
I really wish he hadn't done that, Because it doesn't do you any good unless i can prove it. 
Oh, you're gonna prove it to me? 
I will if i have to. 
But i think you already know. 
Really? How's that? 
I think you've felt his presence. 
And i'm not just talking about the weird things that keep happening. 
I want to know why thomas needs to have your six. 
What? 
I didn't know what it meant, So i looked it up, And it's what a fighter pilot says to another When he's covering his tail, "i've got your six." 
How did you know thomas said that? 
Because he said it to me. 
What do you want from me? 
I want to know what it is that thomas is protecting you from. 
Why he is so mad at brad and krista, So that i can get him into the light where he belongs. 
Lucy, please. 
Just tell me what happened Between him and krista. 
Were they seeing each other? 
Did he send those emails? 
Hi. Justin yates. 
Justin who? 
You don't remember me. 
Yeah, why would you. 
Um, ok, uh, blogger? 
In shame of the devil? 
We met after you won that plaque from the town for, uh, saving those kids. 
Ok, smile. 
Oh. 
What do you want? 
Well, i got this really strange email a few hours ago. 
Ok. 
So why don't you just post it on your blog And i'll read it when i get a chance. 
I know my blog isn't exactly cnn.Com. 
But a lot of your friends and a lot of your customers probably check it out. 
And you know how the internet is. 
Once something starts to spread... 
What are you talking about? 
Here. I'll show you. 
This is a video of me rehearsing a fight i had with my husband. 
Yeah, you know, i thought you would say that. 
Uh, the one problem is, The video made my hamster jump on the wheel, you know? 
And, uh, remembered these files I kind of borrowed from professor payne a while back. 
They were encrypted, And i'd given up on trying to decode them Until tonight. 
What's in the files, justin? 
In a nutshell? 
You see ghosts. 
And you believe that? 
Not so much, really, until i noticed Something about the email that the video was attached to. 
Whoever sent me this clip, their computer doesn't have an ip address. 
And in case you don't know, that's not possible. 
Not in this world, at least. 
The world of the living. 
Wait a minute, um... 
What is it that you want, exactly? 
Well, in my business, Usually when someone sends this kind of message, Someone wants you to stop looking Wherever it is you're looking. 
So you just wanted to give me a warning? 
Yeah, and, uh, maybe a little professional courtesy, In case you find anything interesting you want to share. 
Well, thanks... 
For the warning. 
Good night. 
You're welcome Guilty, guilty, i'm guilty! 
What do you want from me? 
I told you i'm guilty! 
What were you thinking? 
Keeping records of things that i said to you, Things that i told you because i thought that you could be trusted. 
And don't even tell me that they were encrypted, Because we both know how little that's worth. 
All right, think back. 
You come to me, i don't know you from adam. 
And all the things that i've been studying and wondering about, And between you and i, starting to doubt, All of a sudden they're real?! 
But why write it down? 
 look, because it was so amazing, I had to make sure i wasn't dreaming it! 
This was huge stuff! 
For you, it's an old hat, But let's not forget that i'm an academic, And you're sweet, kind, caring, Forgiving melinda, right? 
Don't i have an obligation as my job To write down what i observe? 
Remember, you're You're sweet, kind, forgiving melinda. 
Do you have any idea what this could do to my life? 
Oh, come on, melinda! 
What are you afraid of? 
Everyone you help, they already know that you see ghosts! 
I am afraid of people like you. 
Of becoming a case study So that people can understand things That can't be understood. 
And while i'm under that microscope, I can't even help the spirits that actually need me. 
You've really thought this through, haven't you? 
My whole life. 
Hey, ned, what's going on? 
Is that ned? 
Tell him i'm here. 
It's professor payne, ned. 
Put me on Ned, could you please say that again, Because i had someone very annoying distracting me. 
Ned: lucy just told the school she did all those hauntings. 
The scoreboard, the bleachers, The bat in krista's car, everything. 
What? Why would 
she do that? 
It's like she's trying to protect thomas. 
Thomas is a ghost. 
What is she protecting him from, purgatory? 
Wait, will you just call me back if you get anything else? Bye. 
I don't get it. 
Thomas says that he's protecting her, She's acting like she's protecting him. 
What are they protecting each other from? 
Have you asked krista? 
No. She won't return 
my phone calls. 
All right, well, ever since brad confessed, Maybe she has a lot less to hide. 
Hi, krista, i'm melinda. 
I know who you are. 
Um, i've been trying to talk to you. 
Wow. Do you have, like, 
zero comprehension of the word "no?" 
I do, but did thomas? 
Thomas? 
Yeah, i'm not trying to blame you for anything. 
I mean, i'm sure if you hurt thomas' feelings, You didn't mean to. 
No, i didn't do anything to thomas. 
Ok, we had a couple conversations about bats. 
That's it. 
Well, you were writing to each other. 
It's no secret that the two of you were involved. 
I mean, the entire school got that email. 
No, those emails weren't from thomas, ok? 
So just drop it. 
Well, how can you be so sure? 
They weren't even signed. 
Because, i've written back since he died, And... 
I haven't got a response yet, But whoever was writing me opened them. 
So if thomas wasn't writing them, then who? 
I don't know! 
I gotta go. 
Wait a minute. 
So krista's protecting thomas, too? 
Protecting or stonewalling. 
She's insisting those emails were not from him. 
Or maybe she's just embarrassed That she was cheating on her boyfriend with guano boy. 
I'm not calling names. 
I'm just trying to put it in perspective. 
High school perspective. 
So assuming that krista was telling the truth, And if he wasn't writing those emails, who was? 
Maybe there's some clue to who sent them in the emails. 
You're right! 
You're right, that's all we have to do. 
Do you still have that email on your phone? 
The one the ghost was texting everyone? 
Yeah, but it didn't say much. 
That's ok. 
Little blogger friend of mine Taught me that one is all it takes. 
Professor rick payne in apologetic servitude. 
Melinda: good. 
I'm gonna forward you an email, And i need you to use the ip address To track down the location of the computer that originally sent then. 
Can you do that? 
Sure. 
Yeah, i mean i know a geek who knows a geek. 
I knew you would. 
Remember to tell your mom That we did not spend the whole evening talking about ghosts. 
I helped you with your homework, too. 
Yeah, that was intense. 
How much you know about measuring volumes and planes. 
hello? 
Rick: all right, i can get you The internet service provider and the physical address Of the computer's location. 
No user name, though. 
I would need a court order for that. 
Yeah, but you've already got the address? 
Yeah, do you have a pen? 
Uh, yeah. Ok, 
write this down. 
So whoever answers the door sent those emails to krista? 
I feel for him, whoever he is. 
Hi. 
Lucy? 
Yeah, this is my house. 
Are you looking for someone else? 
Not any more Now's not really a good time. 
Lucy? Who is it? 
Dad, this is ned and melinda. 
They're...from school. 
Why don't you come inside? 
Um, we're sorry to bother you. 
We were just hoping that we could talk to lucy for a few minutes. 
What about? 
This is my wife jill. 
This is melinda and Ned. Hi. 
Hi. 
Is this about the trouble lucy's in? 
In a way. 
It's ok. I can talk to them. 
We'll just go outside. 
No, i don't think so, honey. 
Our daughter's all but been branded a serial killer Because some kids reprogrammed the scoreboard. 
Dad... 
I don't believe for a second you did that. 
I don't care what you told the police or your teachers. 
Well, i actually believe that lucy's innocent, also. 
In fact, i know it. 
Why don't we all sit down? 
How do you know that? 
It's about the letters you wrote. 
Emails, actually. 
The ones you wrote to that kid you like. 
That kid? 
There's this girl i was into. 
If you're here as someone concerned About some inappropriate relationships No, actually, we're just here as friends. 
They're here because of thomas. 
Because he wasn't ok with it. 
Not really...anyway. 
Lucy, what are you talking about? 
The night thomas died. 
"Meet me at 8:00. 
"If you can't make it, forget it. 
I've waited too long." 
Signed krista. 
Are you out of your mind? 
Where did you get that? 
You saved it on the hard drive. 
The hard drive that we share. 
It's private. 
Krista eisenberg. 
She is beautiful, she's a senior, And, oh, what's one little key ingredient Missing in your wacky lesbian fantasy? 
She's not gay. 
We were posting on the same blog! 
She responded to me. 
She wanted my email, And she's the one who kept it going. 
But you never told her who you are. 
You never gave her your name. 
She likes me. 
She doesn't even know she's writing to a girl! 
I think she does. 
Oh, why? 
Because of little things that she said. 
Different stuff that you wouldn't understand. 
You can't do this. 
Ok? You're comitting 
social suicide. 
Once she sees you, she's gonna realize that you tricked her, And she's gonna be pissed. 
If she doesn't want to be with me, she can tell me, And i'll handle it. 
Can you handle What she's going to write about you in the slam book? 
What her friends are going to write about you? 
Once you're a target, Everyone's gonna take a shot. 
People that don't even know you. 
They're gonna terrorize you every day. 
For the rest of high school. 
Lucy, we have got to undo this Before it gets out. 
We're supposed to meet. 
I'll go. 
Ok? I'll figure 
something out. 
Ok? 
The whole thing was a set up. 
Forget her. 
Why would krista do that? 
She's the one who kept emailing. 
She's the one who wanted to meet. 
Why would she send brad? 
I don't--I don't know. 
Maybe she got off of Makin' him, like... 
jealous or something. 
Or she thought that, uh, maybe... 
What? 
I don't know, That the whole thing was just kind of a joke. 
But your brother was lying to you. 
Krista never even knew about the meeting. 
What? 
Brad never told her. 
He sent that email himself, But he never told krista that. 
Why was thomas so mad at krista? 
Because... 
He thought she never meant anything she put in the emails. 
He was sure you were getting set up. 
He thought he was protecting me. 
He had my six. 
Mom and dad, i am so sorry. 
I should have never let him go. 
Oh, baby. 
No one meant for it to happen. 
No, the county is not charging brad, And they shouldn't. 
It was all an accident. 
What about all those things that happened at the schl? 
Are you saying you did it because you're angry? 
No, your son was. 
Lucy took the blame for those things Because she was tired of everybody asking what really happened. 
Ok, now i'm really confused. 
But lucy never was confused. 
She knew who she was, and who she loved, And she wasn't ashamed of it. 
And mom and dad were ok with that. 
Just like they were ok with me being the freak kid Who hung out with the bats all day. 
Thomas is here. 
His spirit. 
What are you talking about? 
He says that you loved both of your children Just for who they were. 
They were cool about everything, But they have no idea what it's like now, For anyone who's different. 
They take a few words and, like,oison your whole world. 
He's worried about lucy. 
All the damage that the internet can do, Spreading cruel words around. 
I mean, look at my sister. 
She's pretty, and smart, and funny. 
Everyone likes her. 
No one had to know that lucy was different. 
He's saying that you could have blended in If you wanted to. 
You mean if i chose to. 
In my heart, i wanted her to change. 
But i was the one that needed to change. 
I was just trying to look out for you, But i realize now that that's not what you needed. 
What you needed was me to see you and to love you for who you are. 
He loves you. 
He always did. 
And he doesn't want you to be anything but who you are. 
I love him, too. 
I love you, thomas. 
Come on. 
Do you see the light? 
Not yet. 
I got one or two things to take care of first. 
So now they think somehow That the computer on the scoreboard Looped into the school server, Like it was just some wires that crossed, Messed everything up. 
So thomas set things right. 
That's great. 
Yeah. 
And lucy's off the hook. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, man. She's pissed 
about the ghost thing. 
Do you want me to go talk to her? 
No, it's ok. 
I can handle it. 
Hey, mom? 
Be mad at me, ok? 
Not melinda. 
I'm the one that pushed her to help. 
I'm not mad at anybody. 
I'm just proud of you For wanting to help your friend. 
Lucy? 
She's not really my friend. 
She called me "ted." 
You see, that's what i mean. 
You didn't care what anybody might call you. 
You still stuck your neck out anyway. 
Your sweet, Beautiful neck. 
I used to kiss it when i put you to bed. 
That was just a second ago, ned. 
And now you're all grown up. 
I am... 
So proud of the man that you are becoming. 
Lucy: hey. 
Me? 
Ned, yeah, hi. 
How have you been? 
Good. Good, you know, 
School, life. 
Um, that was a cool thing you did, Telling me about what you believe. 
I know i didn't make it easy. 
Do you want to sit? 
Yeah. Yeah, ok. 
So has your friend seen my brother around? 
No, but he might still be here. 
Usually she sees them cross over. 
Hey. 
Hi. 
I got your email. 
My email? 
Yeah? 
Wait, don't tell me that it wasn't for me. 
This is weird enough already. 
No, i just--I didn't... 
Don't be shy. 
Just admit it. 
The web works in mysterious ways. 
Wow. 
Busted. 
Thanks for all your emails. 
So you knew? 
Not for sure. 
But, um... 
i hoped. 
You did a good thing. 
I worry about her. 
I don't. 
She looks like she has good friends. 
The light... 
What's it like in there? 
I've heard good things. 
But don't go by me. 
Maybe you should go check it out for yourself. 
Justin. 
Oh, uh... 
Hey. Um, 
I'm not stalking you, i swear. 
You said it, i didn't. 
Ahh, did you ever find out who emailed me that video from the security camera? 
Nope. 
It's like you said, no ip address. 
You got your secrets, that's cool. 
It's just, you know, it's hard not ask about the ones i know about. 
Like your travels underneath the town. 
In the tunnels Under our beloved, perhaps haunted, town. 
Is that professor payne's theory? 
Look, i don't want to out you. 
Ok, i know what that could do to your life. 
Why does this mean so much to you? 
Do you have some sort of thing with the other side? 
Hmm. 
When the time comes, Just remember, i kept your secret. 
What time is that? 
Tony Almeida from CTU has just informed us that they were unable to confiscate this Cordilla virus in Mexico. 
This man Amador, where is he now? 
Latest working theory is that Amador has this virus, and is headed back here to Los Angeles. 
I let you live. 
Tell me what you know. 
Any time Amador does business on the west coast, he washes his deal through a man named Alvers. 
How does Amador contact this Alvers? 
I don't know. 
I've never met him. 
Hello? 
Marcus, it's me. 
I'll be there in an hour. 
Got the virus? 
Yes. 
Just be ready. 
I will be. 
I got to go see Julia Milliken. 
No. I don't want you to go 
anywhere near her or Alan tonight. 
Do you think I'm scared of you? 
Julia... 
My pills. 
No, don't. 
 What are you doing? 
 Don't. 
 Sherry? 
 This is your way out. 
 We killed him. 
 No. 
There's one thing you're going to have to be really clear about, when the authorities come around questioning you. 
I was never here. 
The following takes place between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. 
Point Mugu Naval Air Station I got her. 
 Agent Bauer. 
 Yeah? 
I'm Jason Carusone from Division. 
These men will be escorting the prisoner back to CTU. 
She doesn't leave my sight. 
I know. You can accompany her 
in the lead van. 
Let's go! 
This is Carusone. 
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here. 
Agent Edmunds. 
It's Chloe O'brian from your office. 
Hey, Jack, I'll take another car. 
Okay. 
Yeah, Chloe? 
Chase, they found out. 
Who found out what? 
Everybody here found out about Angela. 
They all know she's your daughter. 
What? How? 
The baby-sitter flaked. She had 
a family emergency and brought her here. 
You brought Angela into CTU? 
What was I supposed to do? 
Your sister's out of town. 
There is no one else. 
You have no idea what I've been through in the past couple of hours. 
Okay, okay, okay. 
Chloe, thank you for covering. 
I appreciate it. 
But where is Angela right now? 
She's downstairs with Marcy until you get back. 
Did Kim find out? 
Chloe, did Kim find out? 
Yes, yes, Kim found out. 
How did she react? 
Uh, gosh, Chase, I think she's kind of pissed. 
All right, listen. 
I'm coming back to CTU right now. 
I'll take care of everything. 
Bye. 
Here's the situation: We believe Michael Amador is in possession of the Cordilla virus. 
We believe he is either headed to LosAngeles or he's here already. 
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen to take out a major metropolitan area. 
Our only lead is Nina Myers, who's being brought back to CTU right now. 
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man here in Los Angeles by the name of Marcus Alvers. 
Adam's done a workup on him. 
We have some background, but there's nothing that places him definitively in Los Angeles today. 
That's it? 
What about interpol? 
What do they have on Alvers? 
Our data tracking's a little behind, so we weren't able to access that report. 
Why are we behind? 
We didn't update the European contact logs while I was down. 
Michelle, you were the ranking agent. 
I didn't think Europe was a priority. 
Obviously it was. 
There was a lot going on at the time. 
All right. 
Let's get back to work. 
And let's try to ease up on the mistakes for the rest of the night as there are millions of lives depending on us. 
Michelle... 
Come. 
I just got off with CTU. 
What's the status on the virus? 
Well, it's not good. 
The limited intelligence they have supports their original suspicion. 
It's on its way to Los Angeles. 
David, it may already be here. 
Then we should be prepared in case they target other cities. 
Our people in the security envelope have been alerted. 
Trust me, it's being handled. 
Now, why don't you try and go get some rest? 
I'm on this. 
Mr. President, 
Mrs. Palmer's here to see you. 
Send her in, please. 
Start waking people up. 
Set up a conference call with the appropriate cabinet members: Homeland security, FBI, National Health Services. 
We're going to need everyone on this one. 
Yes, sir. 
Wayne? 
Sherry, I asked you here to help me, not make things worse. 
I did not want you going to Alan Milliken's house. 
Well, relax, David. 
I didn't go there. 
 You didn't go? 
 No. 
When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person. 
Yes, and I changed my mind. 
I-I spoke to her over the phone. 
About what? 
About Kelly's disappearance. 
I asked her if she would check Alan's cell phone and see if there were any recently made calls. 
And? 
She wouldn't do it. 
You don't take no for an answer, Sherry. 
What aren't you telling me? 
Nothing, David, I swear. 
What have you been up to since we last talked if you weren't at Milliken's? 
Making calls. 
You could have made them from here. 
Yes, but I didn't. 
I parked on the side of the road, I started making calls because I didn't want to wait. 
I told you we have a small window of opportunity here. 
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly. 
All right. 
I have other things to attend to. 
Okay. 
Is there anything else? 
That's it. 
Hello, Nina. 
Take her to interrogation 819. 
Yes, sir. 
What's the security configuration? 
Don't worry about it, Jack. 
We're handling Nina. 
Ryan, you know what she's capable of. 
That's none of your concern right now. 
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out. 
I'm fine. 
I don't think you are. 
What's this about? 
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin. 
Tell me I'm off here, Jack. 
Tell me I'm wrong. 
I didn't think so. 
Ryan, I haven't missed a step. 
I'm fine. 
I have to cover my ass. 
 I need to get you checked out. 
 You're wasting time. 
 Kim. 
 Yeah? 
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back. 
What about Chase? 
Uh, he's a few minutes behind. 
Thank you. 
Kim. 
Dad. 
Oh, god. Hi. 
She's here. 
I know, sweetheart. 
I know. Come here. 
Look, I have to debrief Chappelle. 
I'll see you in a minute, okay? 
Dad, I know about your drug problem. 
Why didn't you come to me with this? 
Come here. 
Come here. 
I'm sorry, baby. 
I'm sorry. 
I was embarrassed. 
And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't. 
I didn't want you to worry. 
Well, is it over? 
No, not exactly. 
I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. 
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out. 
 We'll talk about this later, okay? 
 Okay. 
Don't worry. 
 I love you. 
 Me, too. 
Okay. 
Jack. 
I'm glad you're back. 
It's been difficult without you. 
Thanks, Chloe. 
 Chase. 
 Yeah. 
 Need to talk to you. 
 Okay. 
Why don't you take a few minutes and come to my office. 
Yeah, sure. 
Mr. Milliken? 
Mr. Milliken? Oh, my god. 
Mrs. Milliken! 
Come quickly! 
Quickly! 
Hey. 
How's the hand? 
It's fine. 
How'd Chappelle find out? 
I don't know, it doesn't really matter. 
What's going on out there? 
Almeida's going to be interrogating Nina, and I'll follow it from a feed. 
Okay, good. 
Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors. 
Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything. 
Agent Bauer, keep pressure here. 
Sure. Thank you. 
Jack, you're about to find something out about me that's not going to make you happy. 
What are you talking about? 
Excuse me. Do you mind? 
I've got a daughter. 
 A daughter? 
 It was sprung on me a month ago. 
Her mother dropped her off, and she split. 
It's a long story. 
Does Kim know about this? 
Yeah. 
From you? 
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet. 
You square this with her, Chase, you understand me? 
Just make that right. 
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything. 
I will. 
Are we up yet? 
Yep. Video's piped in, 
voice analysis, vitals, transcription. 
 We're all set. 
 Nick, do you copy? 
 Yeah, I read you. 
 We're ready to go. 
All right, recording to hard drive now. 
So, Tony's doing this? 
Yeah. 
Is that going to be weird for you? 
What do you mean? 
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out? 
Yeah. 
We set? 
Yeah. 
All right. 
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes. 
She's tired. 
We might be able to pick up a tell. 
Okay. 
So, we all right? 
Yeah. We're fine. 
All right. 
Let's do this. 
I got the hi-res on monitor two. 
Tony. 
Didn't know I was gonna see you today. 
You know what we want. 
We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus. 
I've already told Jack everything I know. 
Well, I want you to tell me. 
First Jack, now you. 
Hmm... what does that 
remind me of? 
You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers. 
So, where do we look for Alvers? 
That's a nice ring. 
Who's the lucky girl? 
Hope you did a background check, though, 'cause you don't want to make the same mistake twice. 
You're going back to prison. 
There's a good chance you'll be executed as a traitor. 
Now you know if you cooperate, you may be able to save your own life, but you're stalling. 
Which means you know something and you still think there's a play you can make, only now's not the right time. 
Very incisive. 
I hope your wife appreciates that about you. 
Why don't you tell me about Alvers? 
All I know is that he works only with Amador. 
I don't know him personally. 
All we've been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases. 
He had an MRI on one of his knees, there's a prescription for antibiotics, treated for HIV... 
Her pulse is spiking. 
Someone hasn't been using protection with Marcus Alvers. 
She's probably had sex with him. 
See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room tell me that something in those medical records concerns you. 
I'm guessing it's not the knee. 
I'm here to see Alvers. 
Marcus. 
Michael. 
How was your trip? 
Interesting. 
I still don't understand why you risked so much down in Mexico, why you didn't come here directly. 
240 million dollars made it worth the risk. 
What about Nina? 
If she wasn't killed by the bomb, I'm sure our buyers took care of her once they found out she didn't deliver the virus. 
Either way, she's out of the picture. 
I hope so. 
She can point to both of us. 
We'll be long gone before anyone starts looking. 
Kim. 
Look, I know we haven't talked since I got back. 
No, we haven't. 
I know what you must be thinking, but you need to give me a chance to explain. 
I don't know what to think. 
Look, I'm happy that you're okay, but this thing... 
you have a baby, Chase. 
We've been together for more than three months, and you kept this secret from me. 
Who's the mother? 
Where does she fit into this? 
That's what I want to talk to you about. 
I didn't know I had a daughter until a month ago. 
How could you not know? 
Angela's mother and I went out last year. 
Okay, it's over. 
And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant. 
Now she calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby, and that I'm the father. 
And she's in trouble, and she can't handle it. 
I was afraid to let people find out. 
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up. 
But you told Chloe. 
Chloe and my sister have been helping me take care of the baby. 
She's a good friend. 
Excuse me. Chase? 
You wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
Kim, I'm just as confused as you are. 
But all I know is that I love you. 
And I'm falling in love with Angela, too. 
And I need to make this work. 
Go on. 
What's happening with Nina in interrogation? 
They're getting something. 
What? 
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deeper than we thought. 
You'd better hope she's not just spinning your wheels, because she knows how to manipulate our interrogation protocol. 
Tony knows what he's doing. 
Okay, fine. Look, I need to 
get together with Chloe. 
I need everything that she's got on the Amador investigation. 
Not yet. 
Ryan, look, you're wasting my time. 
Now, I humored you with the physical. 
And we both know that my blood work's gonna come back with trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough. 
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's office is here. 
She wants to talk to you. 
 Well, this is not the time. 
 Actually, it is. 
You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not. 
Come on. 
Rae Plachecki, this is Jack Bauer. 
You know the drill, Jack. 
I'm gonna ask you some questions, but I want you to know, I'm on your side. 
We just want to establish that this heroin addiction was a necessary part of your cover. 
It was necessary to maintain my cover. 
Are we done now? 
Sit down, Jack. 
This is Rae Plachecki. 
The time is 2:31 A.M. 
This is the interrogation of Jack Bauer, director of field ops, CTU. 
Ryan Chappelle is present. 
Jack, tell us how you established your cover with Ramon Salazar. 
I first came in contact with the Salazars approximately two years ago. 
They were an up-and-coming narcotic cartel, coming out of Mexico. 
So, when did you meet Amador? 
Did you know him when you were working at CTU? 
Tell me something, Nina, what kind of a deal you think you're gonna cut? 
You've betrayed everybody you know, including me. 
You murdered Jack's wife. 
You helped terrorists smuggle a nuclear bomb into this country. 
You're helping to unleash a deadly virus into the general population. 
Help me understand this. 
What do you want? 
What is it you get out of being a mass murderer? 
Your neck is bleeding. 
Dalton, what do you got? 
So far, the only reactions we're getting from her are subliminal. 
If she's not gonna say anything, we need to be more plugged in to her vitals. 
We can take her down to seven, give her a passive response test. 
Seven's not secure enough. 
She stays here. 
Where's Richards? 
He's waiting. 
All right, let's bring him in. 
Send Darren in. 
Nina, I don't think you've met Darren Richards. 
He joined us after you left. 
Hello, Darren. 
Don't take it personally. 
He doesn't talk much. 
Uh, something's not connecting up for me, Jack. 
You say that you weren't in with the Salazars until early February, but the first time you started using was late December. 
That's six weeks of shooting up for the benefit of no one. 
Am I missing something? 
I was trying to pass myself off as a junkie. 
I wanted to be prepared. 
What do you mean, "prepared"? 
The Salazars lived their entire lives in the drug world. 
If I couldn't handle the narcotics that went with that territory, they'd have known I was a cop, and they'd have killed me. 
I needed to be able to handle it. 
Yeah, that makes sense, but in January, when you were putting needles in your arm, you didn't have a meeting on the books with these guys it could have been a year, for all you knew. 
What are you saying? 
I am trying to establish incontrovertible evidence that you did drugs as part of your cover if I submit what you just told me, it's not gonna hold up, Jack. 
What do you want me to say?! 
I did drugs to get in with these people, and I got in with them! 
And no matter how difficult it's been, I don't use anymore. 
Look, I'll write it up that way, and maybe it'll fly, but I just think you're gonna have a problem because you never told anyone, not even your partner. 
That's suspicious. 
Rae, you know my history. 
I've had a very difficult time since my wife passed away. 
If I'd told anyone that I was using drugs to develop a case, they would have misinterpreted, and I couldn't afford that risk. 
Yeah, well, that's what they're gonna do now. 
Rae, let's put down that Jack started using heroin in late January, after the first meeting with Salazar was established. 
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Ryan, but that's not what happened. 
Just trying to save us all some paperwork. 
I'm okay with that. 
I'm not. 
I started using in December. 
I've got nothing to hide. 
This office demands results, and that's what I provide: Results. 
Fine. 
Can I get back to work? 
Not quite yet, Jack. 
No, it's secure and we have it. 
It will be as arranged. 
He'll be here in an hour. 
Just as long as we have enough time to leave the country before they let this virus out. 
Please be seated. 
Five hours ago, I went public with a statement that there was a domestic terror threat, but it had passed. 
And now it appears that that was premature. 
Ladies and gentlemen, do we or do we not have a threat of this virus being released? 
Sir, I'm afraid we can't answer that question with any kind of certainty. 
What can you tell me, Mr. Hammond? 
What few leads we have indicate that Michael Amador has the virus and is in Los Angeles. 
For what purpose, we can't say. 
Then we have to prepare for defensive action here in Los Angeles. 
And for that matter, in all of our major cities. 
Mr. President, 
you know our position here at homeland security. 
We think being forthright with the public and making such preparations in the open is the correct course. 
Again, we have to assess the downside of that course. 
I have no problem with that, Mr. President, 
as long as we realize we are working against a clock. 
I want all departments present to work up an open versus covert containment strategy and report back to me in 30 minutes. 
In the meantime, I want Health Services to issue guidelines, but only to be distributed internally. 
That is all. 
I'll be in my office. 
David. 
Give us a second, please, Aaron. 
Of course, sir. 
Secret Service just received a phone call from the west Los Angeles police department. 
Alan Milliken is dead. 
What? 
He was found 15 minutes ago in his home. 
All signs point to a heart attack. 
It isn't possible. 
Well, apparently, it is. 
You told me Sherry was on her way over there about an hour ago. 
She changed her mind. 
Made some phone calls from her car. 
Came straight back here. 
David, is that what she told you? 
Yeah. 
And where is she now? 
Resting. 
Aaron, take me to Sherry. 
Yes, sir. 
She's right this way. 
Hasn't your shift ended? 
I stayed on. 
I sense it's a difficult day, and I wanted to be here for you. 
 I appreciate that. 
 Right in there, sir. 
Sherry. 
David. 
What's wrong? 
Alan Milliken is dead. 
What? How? 
Why don't you tell me? 
What do you mean? 
I told you, I didn't go there. 
I know what you told me. 
You sat in your car, you made some phone calls, and you came straight here. 
Yes, and that's the truth. 
Then you won't mind the police checking your cell phone and the car you used tonight. 
You know... 
you asked me to take care of a problem, and I did. 
If you want the police to check phone logs, then have them check yours first. 
Because remember? 
You called me tonight. 
I am here because of you, David. 
What happened, Sherry? 
I went over to the house just to speak to Julia. 
Alan interrupted us. 
There was an argument and... 
he had a heart attack. 
There's going to be an investigation. 
You're going to have to tell the truth about this. 
The truth isn't going to save either one of us. 
All they're going to hear is that I was there on your behalf to prevent Alan from meddling with your presidency, and that he died from natural causes. 
Now, how do you think that's going to play out in the New York Times for the next six months? 
What did you do to Alan? 
Honestly, David, nothing. 
Absolutely nothing. 
Kim, I transferred that feed to your system. 
Do you want me to pull it up for you now? 
Yeah I don't think she's going to give them anything. 
We're going to have to find Marcus Alvers by ourselves. 
What can I do? 
Um, I followed up on some of those Asian connections, but in the meantime, there's something I want you to look at. 
 It's a long shot. 
 What is it? 
A list of cities where Marcus Alvers has been in the last three years. 
Each time only for a couple of days. 
Maybe he was meeting somebody. 
Cross it with the other suspects in our database. 
Let me know what you come up with, okay? 
Okay. 
Look, I don't know why we have to go through this again. 
I already answered that. 
What is it, Edmunds? 
Just wanted to give you an update on Nina. 
Rae, could you pause that? 
She give us anything new on Alvers? 
No, other than the probability she knew him personally. 
She's not cooperating. 
What are we doing? 
Richards is working on her now. 
I think that's a mistake. 
Why? /I don't think anybody should be 
in there that hasn't worked with her before, doesn't know what she's capable of. 
She'll manipulate him. 
All Richards does is inflict pain. 
There's no way for her to manipulate him. 
All right. 
How much more of this you want to endure, Nina? 
I think this is about it. 
 She hit an artery! 
 Michelle, call medical! 
No, she's bleeding too much. 
We got to take her there now! 
 Tell security! 
 We need someone from medical. 
 Interrogation room 819. 
 Uncuff her. 
Now! 
So what did Sherry have to say? 
That Alan had a heart attack. 
And you believe her? 
I'd be a fool to believe anything Sherry says to save herself. 
But murder? 
I can't imagine she'd do that. 
David, we can't allow ourselves to be caught off guard this time. 
Now we have to assume the worst. 
Then we'd also have to assume that Julia was somehow involved. 
What? 
Whoa, whoa, listen. 
David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not the same kind of person that Sherry is. 
When we find out all the facts, we'll proceed from there. 
I have to go over the morning brief with Jerry. 
All right. 
 Hello? 
 Julia, it's me. 
Wayne? 
I just heard about Alan, and I... 
are you alone? 
The police are here. 
I'm was just going to speak with one of the officers. 
All right, tell me what happened. 
Wayne, Sherry was here when it happened, but she told me not to tell the police. 
Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly what happened over there, all right? 
We were talking with Alan. 
He got excited, then he started to gasp for air. 
He gets angina. 
So you called 911, right? 
No, no. 
I-I tried to give him his medication. 
What do you mean you tried? 
Sherry stopped me. 
I went to help Alan, but she grabbed my arm. 
I just stood there. 
I-I couldn't, I couldn't move. 
I... I... 
 I killed him, Wayne. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
All right, listen to me carefully, all right? 
I killed him. 
Call Alan's lawyer, and do not say anything, anything to anyone until he gets there. 
You understand me? 
Wayne, could you come down here and help me? 
No, and please don't call me. 
I will help you, Julia, I will, but for right now I have to keep my distance, I'm sorry. 
Excuse me, coming through. 
 Let's move, right here. 
 Okay, swing it. 
Come on, come on, let's go! 
One, two, three. 
Carotid's been lacerated. 
Start a twilight drip. 
Yes, doctor. 
Clamp. 
Clamp. 
Keep steady pressure. 
3-0 silks. 
3-0 standing by. 
More gauze. 
Gauze. 
 Got it open. 
 Okay, clamp it. 
Here you go, doctor. 
 Keep the pressure on. 
 Yes, sir. 
Let's get some more gauze in here. 
Okay, she's under. 
I want you two stationed right here. 
Do not leave unless you hear directly from me. 
Okay, Jack, those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask. 
If you got anything else you want to add, Jack, now would be the time. 
That's my statement, as it is. 
My god, Tony. 
Nina tried to commit suicide. 
She jammed her neck into Richards' needle, ruptured an artery. 
Where is she now? 
She's in the clinic being operated on. 
Who's with her? 
Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated. 
I saw her go under. 
Who's with her now? 
Tony, who's with her?! 
Damn it! 
Which way did she go? 
Lock down the building! 
This is Ryan Chappelle. 
Nina Myers is loose in the building. 
Lock it down, now! 
Nina, drop the gun and put your hands on your head, now! 
Kim. 
What the hell are you doing? 
You don't want to be any part of this. 
Shut up. 
Just turn around and walk away. 
If you leave now, you won't get hurt. 
Kim. 
Don't do it, Nina. 
I swear to god, I'll shoot you. 
You won't kill me. 
Nina, damn it. 
Kim, back up. 
Back up. 
Kim, I want you to go back into CTU, tell them we got Nina. 
 Dad, listen to me. We need... 
 Kim, go now! 
Please, baby, just go. 
Go. 
You don't have any more useful information, do you, Nina? 
I do. 
No, you don't. 
Mr President? 
We need medical assistance! Help! 
This is security. l need help at the ramp. 
Clear, sir. 
Clear. 
Step over there, please. 
Give �em lD. 
There you go. 
Open one. 
You OK, Jack? 
l won�t be OK until we get this thing signed. 
That�s not what l meant. 
OK. We�re all here. 
 What kind of changes are we talking about? 
 They�re not deal breakers. 
He�s still gonna give up the terrorist cells. 
He just wants to go to a class 2 detention. 
Not maximum security. 
 You�re giving him it? 
 Yeah. 
My client�s not happy that you won�t hold him in Florida. 
 He�s getting Minnesota. 
 Give him Florida. There�s no difference. 
l let you do yourjobs. 
Why don�t you let me do mine? 
We don�t want this thing going south over some detail. 
Salazar is unstable. We can�t predict what�ll 
push his buttons. There�s too much at stake. 
l know you two spent the last year getting Salazar and l respect that. 
 But there�s a protocol that l have to follow... 
 Luis, come here for a second. 
Putting him away is not the point. lf he 
doesn�t talk, we�ve accomplished nothing. 
l didn�t lose a year of my life to arrest some drug dealer. 
Salazar deals with terrorist cells around the world. Bringing them down is our objective. 
l understand. But if you give Salazar 
everything he asks for, he�s gonna want more. 
This is the deal. And he�s going to take it. 
Here. 
You better be right. 
Douglas. ls that my life 
you�re holding in your hand? 
lt�s ready to be signed. 
Are you in there, Jack? 
(Douglas) Forget about Bauer. 
How can l forget about the man who put me here? 
Pretended to be my friend. 
l�m concerned about you, Jack. 
The things you did to get me here, l wouldn�t wish on anyone. 
Let�s face it, you�ll never be the same. 
Hey. Neither will l. 
So l guess we are in the same boat. 
l�m about to name names, Jack. 
This is a big moment for both of us. 
That makes me happy. 
Because, you see, we are connected now. 
l don�t know. Maybe we always have been. 
l marked the changes. 
l don�t need to see the changes. 
But l do need the pen. 
Unless you want me to sign it with my own blood. 
That�s kind of funny - ��my own blood��. 
Where do l sign this, Douglas? 
Right here. 
You have done a good job as my counsel. 
Been a go-to guy, as they like to say here in the States. But l think they�re on to you. 
And l don�t think you have what it takes to keep your mouth shut. 
(Douglas) What do you mean? 
Son of a bitch. 
Open the door. Open the door! 
Do it now! 
 Get a medic in here. Now! 
 This is your fault, Jack. 
 And what happens next is on you, too. 
 What does that mean, huh? ls that a threat? 
 Chase! 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Back off! 
 Take a walk! 
Did you hear me? 
Did you hear me? 
What happens next is on you, Jack. 
lt�s on you! 
 Dr Macer. We isolated the body. 
 You said my name was on it? 
Yes. lt�s on his chest. 
Run a full panel of tests to be sure, but l think we�re dealing with a pneumonic virus, type lll. 
Type lll? lsn�t that the virus group 
your team�s been doing simulations on? 
l think that�s why this was addressed to me. 
 Has CTU been contacted yet? 
 No. We�ve been waiting for you. 
Go ahead and start the pulmonary tests. 
l�ll call Director Almeida. 
Hey. The President arrive at SC yet? 
Just about. We�re swapping our people 
now Secret Service is in place. 
They�re waiting for your resource assessment. 
All right, l�ll call �em. 
 l�ve had it, Tony, l swear to God. 
 What�s the problem, Adam? 
Chloe O�Brian does not touch my data. 
lf Field Ops wants something, she asks Jack or talks to you, then you tell me. 
 Did she damage anything? 
 That�s not the point. 
My department has zero downtime because of the procedures l put in place. 
 Did she damage anything? Then let it go. 
 No... 
Jack�s got his department and l got mine. But 
we�re all under the same roof, understood? 
Good. Now, lighten up. You�re gonna 
drive yourself and the rest of us crazy. 
All right. Hold on. 
Sunny Macer from Health Services is on the line. 
 By the way, have you heard from Hertzog? 
 No, not yet. 
 Relax, Michelle, you�re gonna get the job. 
 You�re not going to Langley without me. 
Hey. What�s up? 
 This is one l�m sorry to be right about. 
 What are you talking about? 
Cordilla virus. 
lt�s a type lll pneumonic virus. 
Remember l raised the possibility a strain could be out there? 
 Yeah. 
 lt is. 
Someone just dropped off a dead body infected with the virus. 
These guys are serious. They blew up the 
door to get our attention. This is a message. 
That somebody�s got the virus and they�re willing to release it? 
Yeah, exactly. 
Do we need to issue a quarantine advisory? 
No. Once the host is dead it�s not contagious. 
Call the other county facilities, see if there are any more cases. 
 What about the lD on the John Doe? 
 Send everything over. We�ll work it up. 
 lt�s on its way. 
 All right. Thanks, Sunny. 
What is it? 
lnitiate a level one setting protocol. 
(Salazar) And l don�t think you have what it takes to keep your mouth shut. 
(Douglas) What do you mean? 
Salazar could have killed Shaye any time over the last three months. Why today? 
 He was cutting his deal. 
 Maybe, but l don�t think so. 
This is your fault, Jack. 
And what happens next is on you, too. 
��What happens next.�� 
 CTU. 
 This is Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida. 
Hold on. 
 (Tony) Hey. 
 ls anything going on there? 
We just had a major protocol come in. 
Possible biothreat to the city. 
Tell me about it. 
A dead body infected with the Cordilla virus was left at Health Services. 
We figure it�s the first shoe dropping. We�re 
waiting for somebody to take responsibility. 
 Jack? 
 Yeah. 
You thinking this is connected to Salazar? 
l don�t know. l don�t know, maybe. 
 l�ll get back to you. 
 All right. 
 l need copies of all four images. 
 Right away. 
(cheering)  Mr President. 
 Wayne. Are we ready for the runthrough? 
Almost. The advance team dropped a ball 
so we can�t get in there for a few minutes. 
 That�s fine. 
 No, it�s not fine. l fired Judy. lt was her fault. 
She�s done some good work for us, hasn�t she? 
Tonight�s debate is critical. She should have 
had every single base covered but she didn�t. 
Mr President. How do you feel about 
the debate with Senator Keeler? 
Confident. Ready to go. 
Sir, this is your first time back to LA since the attempt on your life. 
 Were you uneasy about coming back? 
 Not at all. 
Los Angeles is a great city. Would�ve been 
back here sooner if events had allowed it. 
What is important is that we�re here now, looking to the future. 
Thank you. That�s all for now. We�ll have a 
formal Q&A this afternoon. You�ll be briefed. 
David, we gotta talk about those GAO members. Keeler�s gonna bring it up tonight... 
David? David, are you all right? 
l�m fine. 
 Let me call one of the resident doctors. 
 No, it�s all right. l�ll wait for Anne. 
 Where you going, Jack? We have to talk. 
 Not now. 
 Then when? 
 Call me. Right now we gotta get to CTU. 
Why? 
Salazar killed Shaye for a reason. He picked 
today to do it. We gotta find out why. 
Fine. Let�s go back in there 
and put the screws on Salazar. 
You think he�s gonna talk to us after what we just watched him do? Not a chance. 
Come on. Let�s go. 
Jack. 
Just call me. 
All right, so what else did Almeida say about this dead body? 
 Jack. 
 What? 
l asked you about Tony. 
What else did he say? 
He said the body was dumped at Health Services. They�re trying to lD it. 
You know, you never answered me before. 
About how you�re doing. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You know what. 
(phone rings)  This is Bauer. 
 Jack, it�s Chloe. 
l have Kate Warner for you. 
Should l put her through? 
Uh... 
Yeah. Put her through. 
 Jack? 
 Hi, Kate. 
l just wanted to let you know l found that leatherjacket you thought you�d lost. 
Oh. Uh... 
 OK. Great. 
 So, uh, what do you want to do? 
l could bring it over. Or send it. 
You don�t have to do that. 
l�ll just send someone over to pick it up. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 OK, then. 
 Kate. How are you? 
You know, it�s hard. 
l miss you. 
l�m really, really sorry. 
Don�t be. 
 Take care of yourself, Kate. 
 Bye. 
 How�s Kate? 
 She�s all right. 
 So you guys are still talking? 
 No, not really. 
All right. None of my business. Sorry. 
l didn�t mean it like that. She�s just trying 
to return a couple of things of mine, that�s all. 
Got any water? 
Talk to Sunny. She was checking with 
the other facilities for any more cases. 
lf there are, find out where. 
Take all the regional cells that have bioterrorist capabilities and put �em in a high-speed cache. 
 OK. 
 (phone rings) Tony, it�s Larry Hertzog from Langley on line two. 
Hey, Larry. 
Yeah, we are. 
Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. 
Yeah, l will. Thanks. 
 Was that about me? 
 Yeah. 
He doesn�t have ajob for you right now. 
There�s no new funding till after the election. 
l see. 
Also, Larry told me that he needs an answer from me by the end of the day. 
They�re in a hurry to fill the post. 
We both know you can�t pass this up. 
lt�s a major career move. 
Call him and tell him it�s yes. 
And you�ll come along as the wife? 
Without ajob? 
l�ll go anywhere with you. 
As long as l don�t have to cook. 
Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook, l will take you with me anywhere. 
But if they don�t have ajob for you, l�m not interested. 
(phone rings) Tony. Homeland Security on line one. 
We�ll talk about it later. 
Almeida. 
Pretty much. Just have to refresh 
the data on my panel. Thanks. 
 Hey, Kim. 
 Yes, Michelle? 
 You ever done a capability search? 
 Couple of weeks ago, for Tony. 
 The East European cells? 
 Yes. 
Good. This one�s different. 
lt�s gonna be global. 
 Here�s my access code. 
 l�ll get right on it. 
Thanks. 
Hey, Adam. 
Does the link file have DES encryptions? 
No, it�s two key. 
 What volume is the filter on? 
 �tude seven. 
 Thank you. 
 You�re welcome. 
Are you saying you had to break me? 
No, mi �ngel. 
lt was you who break me. 
(phone rings) ? Qu� m�s? 
? Seguro? 
S�, se�or. 
OK, it�s coming up now. 
Thanks, Chris. 
 Adam, l�m piping this over to your system. 
 What is it? 
Frags on the body that was dropped off at Health Services. We�re doing an lD analysis. 
 Where are you in the capability search? 
 lt�s gonna be another 15 minutes. 
 So you�re open? 
 What do you need? 
Adam�ll break off part of an lD. 
We need a name. Give her the file. 
 l don�t need her help. 
 Yes, you do. 
This is urgent. 
l�m ready, Adam. Send the file. 
 l�m open, Adam. Send me the file. 
 No. 
 Michelle told you... 
 l don�t need anyone doing my work for me. 
 What is your problem? 
 Everyone in this place earned theirjob. 
You got it cos of your dad. 
What the hell is this? 
(dials phone)  Tracy, is your system locked? 
 No. 
OK, thanks. 
lt could be you forgot to set the group permission. 
Someone who knows the tree structure changed the ownership. 
That wouldn�t be me because l�m incompetent and only got this job because of my dad. 
 Change the ownership back, Kim. 
 Send the data fork. 
lt�s your ass. Michelle�s waiting. 
Fine. l�ll send it. Just unlock my system. 
No problem. 
 Hey, Jack, l�ll be up in a minute. 
 OK. 
Chloe. Give me what you got. 
Everything Health Services sent is in volume one. 
 l�ve reprised all the Salazar information. 
 Where are the date keys? 
 l couldn�t get those for you. 
 Why not? 
You�ll have to talk to Tony, so he can tell Adam and Adam can give them to me. 
 You�re kidding me, right? 
 No. Adam�s anal and he hates women. 
Chloe. 
Just get it for me, OK, please? 
Close my door. 
(grunts) (phone rings)  Yeah? 
 lt�s Michelle. 
The teleconference with Health Services is about to start. Come down. 
No, l�m gonna stay up here. 
Patch them through. 
 OK. 
 Thanks. 
You scared me. 
 What are you doing in here? 
 l am refreshing a drive. 
What�s going on with Salazar? 
Were you there when it happened? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, it was pretty crazy. 
How�s my dad taking it? 
 He�s OK. 
 Good. 
l was thinking about talking to him today. 
Uh-huh. 
 Today might not be the best day. 
 Chase, no day is a good day. 
We said that we would tell him if we were still together after two months. lt�s almost three. 
Why don�t we just tell him and get it over with? 
All right. 
But l�ll do it. OK? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes, l�m sure. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
You can�t put the drives there. 
What l need you to do is look under... 
 F6, right? 
 Yeah. OK, thanks. 
We received results of more tests. 
The news isn�t good. 
This is a weaponised strain. 
lt has been engineered to kill more rapidly. 
How rapidly? 
lt�s a bit of a guess but, based on the autopsy, if infection starts at Tequals zero hours, there�s a noncontagious latency period of 14 hours. 
After 14 it presents. After 20 the host 
is incapacitated. By 24 the host is dead. 
What are the epidemiological consequences? 
if the virus initiates at a single location, there will be a couple hundred cases by the end of day one. 
By the end of day two it could be in the thousands, but from there it�s easier to talk about in percentage of population. 
By the end of the first week, nine per cent of Los Angeles county will be infected. 
Nine per cent? 
That�s over a million people. 
And those people will die within 24 hours of infection. 
So tell me, if someone were gonna try to release this virus into the general population, how would they do it? 
That�s the million-dollar question. 
lt could come from anywhere. 
We don�t know who has it. 
We don�t know where they plan to release it. 
We don�t even know what form it�s in. 
(� ��Horse Drawn�� by Memory Bank)  (knock at door)  (woman) Kyle? 
What, Ma? 
 Tim wants you to know he�s at the pool. 
 Thanks, Ma. 
Can you take me to the doctor later on this afternoon? 
 What�s Dad doing? 
 On ajob interview. Fingers crossed. 
Fingers crossed. 
Can Aunt Norma take you? 
Why? What�s so important 
that you can�t take me? 
l mean... 
lt�s just l got a bunch of stuff to do today, Ma. l�m sorry. 
 Fine. l�ll call Norma. 
 Thanks. 
Love you, Ma. 
Mr President. The country was in shock 
after the attempt on your life. 
But its prayers were answered when you survived. 
That said, many Americans have expressed concern that you are not fully recovered, and are not strong enough to serve for four more years. 
How would you respond to those who make such claims? 
l wake up every morning at 5am. 
l spend the first hour in the weight room. 
While l�m exercising, l�m prepping for my meetings. 
 And then l put in a 16hour day... 
 Hold on! 
Could we pause the video, please? 
Get ready to play it back. 
Sorry, Chuck. Hold on. Don�t dignify 
that question with a defensive response. 
l didn�t realise that stating the facts was being defensive. 
They bring up the assassination attempt, fine. 
You remind them it was your administration that arrested the man behind the attempt on your life and exposed his organisation and put his top-tier people away. 
All this while you were in this so-called ��weakened state��. 
Keeler would be lucky to have a fraction of your energy. That�s what you tell �em. 
Mr President. Go ahead, Chuck. 
And Mom called him the timid brother. 
Ah, there�s my doctor. How are you? 
 Mr President. 
 (Wayne) All right. Let�s break for a minute. 
l�m fine. How�s he been? 
 Seems a little tired. 
 l am not tired. l�m just a little jetlagged. 
How�s this going? 
l�m definitely winning the run-through. 
(phone rings)  130 over 80. 
 Good. This is Wayne Palmer. 
 How tired? 
 l�m fine. 
 We haven�t done a workup in a while... 
 No. No, no, no. No tests. 
You start looking for something and you don�t stop until you find it. 
l�m fine, Anne. 
OK. 
But when you get back to DC, l want you to have a complete physical. Doctor�s orders. 
Yes, ma�am. 
Anne. l need him alone for a minute. 
 He�s all yours. 
 What is it? 
l just received a disturbing call from Health Services. 
They found a body in Los Angeles that�s been infected with a contagious and deadly virus. 
There�s concerns it�s notjust a random occurrence. 
 Meaning what? 
 CTU is looking to the possibility that this could be a criminal action. 
Criminal action? Based on this one death? 
l don�t know the details, but it has to do with the circumstances under which the body was found. 
 Keep your eye on this one. 
 OK. 
Chuck, can we go down to question seven, about homeland security? 
 Chloe. 
 Yes? 
 Where are the transcripts of Salazar? 
 l sent them to your system, in your directory. 
Dammit, l wanted it stored with the rest of the files from Salazar. 
OK. l�ll do it. 
Chloe, if you can�t get things right the first time, l can get someone who can. 
lf you wanted it with the other files you should have said so. 
 That isn�t standard, so l wouldn�t do it. 
 Do it that way from now on, OK? 
l can�t read minds. You�ll just 
have to spell it out for me, otherwise... 
Dammit, Chloe! Just do it now! 
Fine. 
Hey, Jack. 
What? 
 What was that all about? 
 l need you to replace Chloe for me. 
Replace her? She�s the best analyst we got. 
 She�s not. She�s slow. 
 She�s not slow. 
She may be a little weird but she knows her stuff. 
You look like hell. 
What did you just say to me? 
We�re on an active protocol, OK? 
l need to know if you�re up for it or not. 
l like working with you, Chase. 
You�re a nice kid. 
But don�t you ever come into my office and talk to me like that again. Understand? 
l�m just saying you�re on edge. OK? 
l mean, come on, man, you�re about to fire Chloe for no reason. 
 Chloe. 
 Yes? 
l�m sorry l took your head off. 
We�re just having a bad morning, OK? 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
You�re happy? 
Look, Jack. There�s one more thing 
l gotta talk to you about. 
(phone rings)  This is Bauer. 
 (Tony) We�ve got something new on Salazar. 
OK, we�ll be right down. 
They got something on Salazar. 
What do you wanna tell me? 
Nothing. lt�ll hold. 
Good. 
ln order to plug any possible security breaches, we�ll do date checks from now on. 
Break your logs into eight-hour intervals. 
Put different encryptions on each interval. lf 
one is breached, one won�t bleed to the other. 
 Did you tell him? 
 No. There�s a lot going on. lt�ll happen. 
An anonymous call came in to the FBl ten minutes ago. They�re gonna stream it to us. 
 Did you hear it? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. lt�s ready. 
 Bring it up. 
(distorted) You�ve received our package and realised we�re in possession of a type lll pulmonary immuno virus. 
Listen very carefully to these instructions. 
Our demand is very simple. 
We want the release of Ram�n Salazar in the next six hours. 
if you refuse to comply, the virus will be unleashed to the general population. 
As your experts will tell you, you will not have time to stop its spread. 
Details of how Ram�n is to be delivered will follow. 
 That�s it. 
 Do we know where the call originated? 
lt came out of a scrambled satellite signal. 
We�re trying to narrow it down. 
You know Salazar better than anybody else here. Who are we dealing with? 
His brother. Hector was next in command. 
He went underground when Ram�n was taken into custody. 
Look. l know that the Salazars own multiple 
properties in South America and Mexico, registered under dummy corporations. 
Unfortunately, the Mexican government is saying they can�t locate them. 
We�re gonna have to throw out a pretty large net to trace the origin of that call. 
 We�ll work on it. 
 How are we doing with the lD on the body? 
 Michelle�s running the DNA. 
 What about prints and dental? 
 No teeth, no fingertips. 
 We need this lD. lt�s the only hook we�ve got. 
What about questioning Salazar? 
Complete waste of time. 
This is a man without vulnerability. 
He doesn�t respond to interrogation or care about a living soul, including his children. 
Tony! We�ve a match on John Doe. 
 Show us what you got. 
 The dead body is a David Goss. 
He�s a street dealer in East LA, also an informant. 
He flipped sides so many times DEA stopped working with him. 
 Last known address? 
 We�re working on it. 
We need to know who infected Goss. Work up 
a list of people involved in his life this week. 
 We�ll pull together everything we can. 
 Work it from the other side too. 
Go through Salazar�s network. 
Find the supplier who sold to Goss. 
Good work. Chase, come with me. 
Let�s see if anything�s come in on Hector. 
Entonces, aseg�rate. Que no se note nada. 
S�, se�or. 
Ponle el petrol. Ponle fuego. 
Sigue, ponle el petrol. 
Why do you have my father doing this kind of work for you? 
lt�s not his job. 
lt is today. 
Why did you kill Shaye? 
Take a look around. You�re in a US prison 
where your ass will rot until you�re executed. 
You want to improve your conditions here, you better start talking to me. 
 What do you want to talk about? 
 Why did you kill your attorney? 
 l didn�t want him talking to you. 
 About what? 
About anything. 
lt�s eating at you, isn�t it? 
What am l up to? Come on, Luis. 
You have me in chains. Two tough guys 
waiting for a chance to beat me to a pulp. 
Do it, Luis! 
See if you can beat it out of me. 
You are no fun. 
Where are you going? 
Claudia. 
Claudia. 
Claudia! 
What�s wrong? 
My father is the ranch foreman. 
You promised he wouldn�t be involved in your other activities. 
l pay him three times over. 
He can perform an extra task or two. 
No, no, no. No. 
l told you when we came to live here that l didn�t want him or my little brother to be exposed to your illegal business. 
You broke your word, Hector. 
And that hurts me. 
lt hurts. 
l�m sorry, Claudia. 
 Please, l make it up to you. 
 How? 
l give your father some time off. 
An extra month�s pay. 
That�s your solution to every problem, isn�t it? 
Money. 
Claudia. 
Claudia. 
Claudia! 
(phone rings)  Yeah? 
 Have you made the call to the FBl? 
Yes, l did. 
 What about our boy? 
 l�m watching him now. 
 Keep him close. 
 l will. 
So what was it like to get knee-deep in some fine Tijuana dell? 
Huh? 
 l didn�t do that. 
 What do you mean? 
l mean l didn�t go down there to get laid. 
 But you said... 
 No, l know. l know what l said. 
l just didn�t wanna tell you in case something happened. 
So, what�s the big secret? 
Remember Zach Parker from high school? 
Sure. Didn�t he get busted last year 
for dealing coke? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Whatever. He set me up 
with this guy down there. 
 ��Set you up��? How do you even know him? 
 l know him, OK? 
What are you into here, man? 
Are you selling dope? 
No. 
 l�m not exactly selling anything... 
 Then exactly what are you doing? 
This guy... he paid me five grand 
to bring some coke over the border. 
l did that last night. 
Today l drop it off, l get another five. 
 You�re outta your mind. 
 lt�s just one time. 
Getting over the border�s the hard part. 
That�s already done. 
Why are you doing this? 
Cos my mom�s on dialysis. 
My dad�s out of ajob. 
We�re about to get evicted from this crappy apartment. ls that good enough for you? 
Dude, you are seriously insane. 
Look, Tim. 
l�m about to make this drop later today. 
l was thinking, maybe we could go together. 
 Forget it! 
 You just wait in the car. 
l go in, l make the drop, l come back out. 
That�s it. There�s no big deal. 
l�m not interested. 
Think about it. 
(girl squeals)  Mr President, sir. 
 Mr President, sir. 
Carry on. 
 When did FBl get this call? 
 About 20 minutes ago. 
 We don�t know who we�re dealing with? 
 lt was a scrambled voice on an open line. 
All we know is what he said. They want 
Salazar or they�re gonna release the virus. 
What�s your take on this, Wayne? 
Do we cancel the debate? 
So far, DOD, the Pentagon and CTU haven�t recommended raising the alert level, but they are discussing whether or not we should stay in Los Angeles. 
 Sir. 
 Yes, Aaron? 
Dr Packard�s here. She�s asked to see you. 
 Tell her l�m busy, please. 
 Yes, Mr President. 
Aaron, wait. 
 Tell her l�ll speak with her. 
 Yes, sir. 
You really wanna do that right now? 
Yes, Wayne, l do. 
 Yes, Anne? 
 l want you to start taking these. 
One in the morning and one before you go to bed. lt�ll help your energy. 
 l told you l was fine. 
 l know what you told me. 
Are you gonna trust your doctor or not? 
Course l am. 
So, what�s going on? You seem upset. 
Nothing. 
lt�s just gonna be another one of those days. 
What does that mean? 
l�ve got to get back. 
OK. 
We�ll talk later. 
 What is wrong with this system? 
 What? 
The grid won�t come up. 
That�s because you need to ��control S�� out of it. 
You�re still in Navigation. 
Thank you. 
Look, can you just patch it through to my office? 
(coughs)  What�s his problem today? 
 Nothing. 
This time line goes straight from December to February. 
 What are you trying to do, Jack? 
 Same as you. Solve this problem. 
That�s not what l�m talking about. 
Listen, Jack. 
l�m gonna be honest with you. 
l look up to you. 
l�d take a bullet for you if l had to, but right now l�m gonna hold the mirror up. 
You were under with Salazar for six months. 
l know what they did to you. 
And l know what you did to yourself. 
You can�t make that go away overnight. 
You think l didn�t know? 
You should mind your own business, Chase. 
All l�m trying to say is that l�m here for you. 
But today is not the day to try to prove to everybody that you�re all better. 
lt�s about to hit the fan. 
You know that and l know that. 
So do what you gotta do, man. 
Get your head straight so we can do our work. 
(phone rings) Dad, you up there? 
Dad? 
Yeah. 
Can l come up? 
l need to talk to you about something. 
Uh... 
Not right now, sweetheart. 
l�m in the middle of something. 
OK. Call me when you have a few minutes. 
OK. 
Did you feel that? 
 Yeah. 
Yeah? Yeah. 
We've got an apartment fire on town square. 
 Yeah, I'll be right there. 
Pull that hose, set the master stream on top. 
Hey, will. 
What was it, gas? 
Yeah, most likely. 
Looks like a couple floors collapsed on themselves. 
Better get in there. 
Yeah, we will, as soon as we get the word that it's stable. 
Anybody left in the building? 
don't know until we get inside That's it, let's go. 
Anyone in here? 
Ok, if anybody can hear us, make a sound. Please! 
Make a sound! 
help me. 
Will, I got one. 
Hey, how you doing? 
How is he? 
Get me out of here. 
I ca-can't feel anything. 
Take it easy. Keep breathing. 
We're gonna get you out of here. 
Jim, get this one. Got it? 
Lift up the beam. 
 All right. 
It's not going, it's not going. 
Come on! 
It's not moving. 
That's fine, that's fine. 
We're gonna get you out of here. Come on, ready? 
Damn it, come on! 
Jim, jim, we got another one! We got two! 
We need more men, we got a guy trapped! 
I never stopped. Never. 
We'll get you out. 
Look, I need more men. I got 
a guy trapped in here. Please. 
Send them in. 
Are you ok? 
Unstable, evacuate now. 
I repeat, you must evacuate now. 
 Jim! 
I'll be right back. 
Jim... 
 what? 
They're calling us out. 
The building's too unstable. It's coming down. 
But we can't leave we gotta go, it's too unstable! 
Damn! Can he move? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Take him, take him. 
Grab his legs. 
All right, go. Let's go. 
Move, move, move, move, move! 
We've got a live one coming out! 
There's still a guy in there. 
what? 
 I have go back in there, come on! 
It was clear. It was obvious. 
The guy under the beam, he was gonna die the minute they took it off of him. 
He was half-dead already when I got to him. 
So you did the right thing. 
You know, the guy, he's sitting up. 
He's looking around, he knows what's going on. 
I only have time to get one guy. 
I have to make the call who's got the better shot. I mean... 
I had to. 
Exactly. 
Then why do I feel like I just condemned a man to death? 
Like I should have saved them both. 
Because you're you. 
That's why I love you. 
A man's life was saved tonight. 
Thanks to you. 
Hey, medic. 
We've got half a dozen people coming in. 
We're shorthanded in the E. R. 
Can you help us out? 
Jim: Yeah, I just gotta scrub up. I'll be right in. 
The man who was under the beam, what was he wearing? 
A bathrobe, I think. 
Don't even tell me... 
 no. Go. 
All right. 
proudly presents Ghost Whisperer Season03 Episode12 Leaving that guy behind was the right thing. 
Yeah, that's what everybody keeps telling me. 
Decisions like that get made all the time. 
You don't ask for them, but you have to make the call. 
All you can do is focus on the ones you can save. 
You're good. 
So are you. 
Be sure of yourself, that's important. 
I'm not sure what I'm sure about. 
Even applying to med school. 
Pressure on that right there. 
 Yeah. 
Mid-life career change? 
I prefer to think of it as maybe a third of the way through my life career change. 
It's not easy, I know. 
Did you do something before this? 
doesn't matter. Just 
retract that right there. 
Ok, guys, thanks. 
We'll take it from here. 
Thank you. 
What are you doing? 
You need to be a little more careful, nurse. 
sorry. 
Melinda: So the guy who was left behind didn't make it? 
Yeah. 
Died in the building collapse. 
I'm really sorry. 
I just wish there was something I could do. 
Yeah. 
I just can't get his face out of my head. 
Well... I know I asked, but you didn't 
see his ghost in the hospital, did you? 
I mean, he's not haunting me? 
Well, there's always ghosts in the hospital. 
You know that. 
Can't tell who's who. 
Yeah, there was just something weird happening in the E. R. 
Look... 
if his ghost was around, could I talk to himth rough you? 
I mean, just to explain what happened, why. 
I guess. 
I mean, sometimes ghosts get angry, and... 
anyway, you're not being haunted, so don't even worry about it. 
Well, I'm gonna hit the shower. 
Do you want tea or juice or something? 
Scotch would be better. 
Juice is good. 
Do you want this in there or by the bed? 
Jim: In here, please. 
When the curtain closes, people die. 
Are you ok? 
Uh, yeah. I just, um... 
I thought you were in the shower. Duh. Careful. 
There's glass everywhere. 
Look, I don't know if you're here, or if you're even listening, but I t ow thaknyou must be really angry about the way things turned out. 
I can help you if you'll let me. 
You have to understand that my husband wanted to save you, he just couldn't, and it's not his fault. 
See, he's really torn up about things, and I just think if you blame him, he may never get over it. 
You see, he's got a lot to deal with it. 
I mean, just being married to me, that's a lot to... 
anyway, I know that you've been through something very bad, and I just want to... 
joe? 
Joe grimaldi? 
 Yeah. 
Melinda, right? Jim clancy's wife. 
Yeah, we met a few years ago. 
Do you still run the vfw? 
I volunteer there. Now I 
have a landscaping business. 
You know, I keep busy. 
Did you lose someone in the building? 
My brother. 
They said he was trapped in there. 
The hospital said he was alive when they got to him, but they couldn't get him out. 
Your brother? 
I just had to come here. 
I don't know why, I... 
I just wanted to see all this for myself, I guess. 
What was your brother's name? 
Vince. 
I'm so sorry. 
Were the two of you close? 
Well, as close as you can be, I guess. 
No. I guess we weren'T. 
It was my fault. 
What if you could change all that? 
What would you do if you could just talk to him one more time? 
What? 
Look, I know how this is going to sound... 
but I see spirits. 
I can talk to them. 
I can help them cross over, and your brother is still here. 
He's an earth-bound spirit. 
My brother's a ghost? 
 Yes. 
And jim, my husband, he was the paramedic who found him last night, and he wanted to save him so badly, but I just think your brother's coming after him now, because he blames him- - look! 
I don't want to hear any of this. 
I don't know what it is you're trying to sell me. 
Please, just hear me out! 
It's not funny, you know? 
To mess with people's emotions like this, or whatever the hell it is you're trying to do. 
It's not right. 
Joe, please... 
************ Do you remember me? 
Jim, right? 
The future doctor. 
Feeling better? 
Well, that's debatable. 
Hey, I wanted to ask you, the guy I had to leave in a building, where you here when they brought him in? 
Yeah, he was D. O. A. 
But they kept him in the E. R. Until 
they reached the next of kin. 
Look, I don'T... 
I want to try to talk to his family and explain what happened. 
I don't think the hospital's gonna release that. 
Yeah, uh... 
that's why I wanted to ask you. 
Don't do this. 
You know every cliche about not getting emotionally involved with the patients. 
Yeah, I know all about that, but I'll tell you, if it was me, if it was my family, I'd want to know exactly what happened. 
You know, why decisions were made. 
This isn't about that guy's family. 
You want to make yourself feel better. 
You want them to look you in the eye and say, "it's ok, we don't hold it against you. " 
Ok. Maybe. 
But you can't tell me that family wouldn't want to talk to the last person that saw their son alive. 
Jim, you can't do this. 
Take it from me, you have to be able to let go. 
You do your job, you do your best, but you have to move on. 
You have to put up the walls. 
Otherwise... 
otherwise you'll lose yourself. 
Just move on, save the next patient. 
You have a lot more wins than losses. 
You can't let the hey, hey, what are you doing? 
I don't know! 
I I can't ******* Are you ok? What happened? 
I don't know. 
I- I don't know what happened. 
I'm sorry, it... 
it was some sort of spasm. 
Now, look. 
Do not be sorry. 
Don't be sorry. This-this 
had nothing to do with you. 
You better... 
you gonna be all right? 
Jim: Are you here, huh? I wish I knew. 
I don't even know if you can hear me, but... 
I want to tell you that I'm sorry. 
If there was anything else, I could have tried, if there was any way to save you, I would have done it, I promise. 
But you... 
you were so badly hurt. 
I knew you were gonna die, I could see it in your eyes. 
Leaving you there... 
like that was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. 
I'm not real good at this. 
My wife would know what to say to you. 
She knows how to handle grief. 
She knows how to handle loss. 
Me, not so much. 
For so many people... 
she knows how to make a difference. 
I'm not sure I do, in the grand scheme of things, but... 
Look, for whatever its worth, Accept my apology for what it is. 
If you want to punish me, here I am. 
But do not take it out on the people around me, or the people I love. 
Jim, I'm home. 
 That's her. 
Honey, I'll be down in a minute. 
Miranda: Look, I know that you have no reason to, but I really need you to take a leap of faith. 
I know that you'd want your brother to be at peace, and you can help him do that. 
When I left you last night, I did something I haven't done in probably 30 years. 
What? 
I cried like a baby. 
This isn't just about not believing in ghosts, is it? 
The truth is... 
I was a lousy brother. 
I did things. 
Things that I'm ashamed of. 
About a month or so ago, I sent vince a letter. 
I- I tried to explain. 
I- I asked him to forgive me. 
I didn't hear back. 
Yeah, but this could be your chance to do it in person- kind of. 
If it's true, and vince is out there look, I could stand here all day and talk to you about unfinished business and the importance of closure, but there's much more at stake. 
I really believe that your brother's ghost is trying to hurt my husband. 
You're the only one that can help me. 
Ghosts usually come back to where they died. 
Your brother knows that I can see him, so if he senses me here, maybe he'll come to me. 
If you're here, I brought someone to talk to you. 
Please. 
He's here. 
Just speak from your heart. He can hear you. 
I- I, uh, I really don't know how to do all this, where to start. 
If you're really here... 
I just want to say I'm sorry. 
It's not like you went out of your way to stay in touch, I mean, I don't know why you couldn't pick up the phone. 
Yeah. 
I guess none of that matters. 
The thing is, vince, I owe you an apology. 
When we had that big fight that christmas, I said things I shouldn't have said; things I didn't really mean; things that changed everything between us. 
If I could take it all back, I would. 
I sent you that letter. 
When I didn't get an answer, I figured you were through with me, and I didn't blame you. 
Anyway... 
I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. 
Please. 
Is there anything you want to say? 
Yeah, who is this guy? 
Your brother. 
I don't have a brother. 
Well? 
Does he forgive me? 
Didn't you die in the building collapse? 
What building collapse? 
What's going on? 
Well, if you didn't die in a building collapse, then why are you haunting my husband? 
I can care less about your husband. 
She's the one I want. 
She's the one who killed me. 
What's going on? 
knownthis couldn't be real. 
Look, it is real, ok? 
I just made a mix-up and I'm really sorry! 
So what? I just poured my heart out 
to some dead guy I don't even know. 
Look, it means that your brother crossed over right away; that he's at peace, ok? 
That's a good thing! 
Well, maybe he's at peace, but I'm not. 
So it wasn't his brother. 
It was another guy altogether. 
The good news is, the ghost that I thought was haunting you wasn't haunting you. 
The bad news  wait a minute. 
Wait a minute, back up here, mel. 
You told me in the hospital that you thought there was not a ghost haunting me. 
Well, you know what, you were really upset, and I just didn't want to add to it by telling you there was an angry ghost I just wanted to talk to this guy. 
I wanted to tell him how sorry I was. 
This ghost was not in the mood to talk. 
He's all about revenge. 
Mel, this is wrong, ok? 
I don't need to be protected. 
I don't need to be treated like a child. 
I was not treating you like a child. 
I was actually looking out for you a little, like you do for me. 
You don't let me look out for you. 
But here I am, trying to find the next of kin of this guy, somebody to talk to. 
You're talking to his brother behind my back. 
It wasn't his brother. 
So what? 
Look, I know that I screwed up here, and we will talk about this later. Ok? 
But for right now, I've really got to get a pen in this thing. 
I mean, this ghost is haunting some nurse at driscoll. 
Um, jennifer quinlan. 
He says that she killed him. 
What? 
Wait, is that credible? Is that true? 
I don't know. 
I mean, he's been very confused and a little hard to figure out, but I did get a name. 
Peter. Peter harrison. 
Wait, I know this nurse, ok? 
She's solid. She's solid. 
What's happening here is what happened to me. 
She had a patient, dheied, he's blaming her. 
Well, I need to check online and see if I can find anything. 
In the meantime, can you please just check on jennifer and how peter harrison died? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I'll check on her when I go in. 
We'll talk about the rest of this later. 
Whatever you want. 
Callin' it a night? 
Yeah. 
Just worked a double. 
So how are you liking grandview? 
Oh, it's ok. 
A little provincial, maybe. 
I'm still getting my bearings. 
Yeah? Where'd you work before? 
I moved around a lot. 
Been a bit of a gypsy. 
 Oh, yeah? 
But always hospitals, huh? 
Are you doing my bio? 
Uh, yeah, look, I'm sorry. 
This is gonna sound a little weird, but, um, I came across a name. 
A patient I was wondering if you might know. 
Um, peter harrison. 
What is it you want to know? 
I want to know if you know if this patient died, and if there were any circumstances surrounding his death that were a little strange. 
You remember how I told you how important it was not to get personally involved with patients? 
Yeah. 
Well, I wasn't always good at taking my own advice. 
Peter harrison was a patient of mine at my old job, and he was very sick, and I came to care for him very much. 
Too much. 
And when he died, well, I was just wrecked. 
I felt helpless and alone, and I knew I should have never let it go that far. 
So you quit? 
I wanted to start over some place where I didn't know anybody, where maybe I would never know anybody. 
Nothing What did you think? 
Nothing. I'm sorry. 
I was just curious. 
Well, I should probably get going. 
Yeah. Good-bye. 
No, don't! 
Please don'T. 
When the curtain closed, I died. 
Did someone kill you? 
Was it the nurse, nurse quinlan? 
No. It was my doctor. 
Doctor sutherland. 
No. No! 
Please don't! 
Jim... come on in, bud. 
Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
Well, listen... 
I got nothin'. 
You mean like nothing suspicious? 
No, I mean like nothing like in nothing. 
6 months ago, jennifer quinlan, she shows up in grandview, rents an apartment, puts all her paperwork through the dmv, and the next thing you know, she's got a job at the driscoll county medical center. 
All right, but what about before that? 
Jim, I got-nothing. 
It's like she dropped out of the sky. 
I mean, she's got a fake social security number, yeah, but no other documentation of any kind. 
I mean, not in driscoll county, not in the northeast. 
It's like she's got no past, like she's a ghost. 
She can't be all bad. 
She does volunteer work. 
Where? 
You're gonna let her do this again? 
Jennifer: Can I help you? 
I'm sorry. 
Do I know you? 
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry. 
All this from a bumper. 
NO RESULTE FOUND Jim? 
Jim? 
What are you doing here? 
Just looking for you, dr. Sutherland. 
You want to talk to me? 
Wait a minute. 
Nora, talk to me about peter harrison. 
Or were there others? 
Like peter harrison's father? 
You shouldn't stick your nose into other people's business, jim. 
I just need this ghost to come to me. 
I need something more credible, you know? 
Something I can actually go to the police with. 
Yeah, but why would the ghost come to you if it was haunting dr. Sutherland? 
I don't know. Probably because he knows 
that I'm the only one who can see him. 
There was no suspicion, no investigation of the san diego hospital? 
Not that I could find. 
She quit, and nobody ever saw her again. 
I just came from the hospital and jennifer, nora sutherland, whoever she is, didn't show up for her shift, her phone's not picking up, and she hasn't returned any of her pages. 
She skipped town. 
Yeah, but what if the ghost skipped with her? 
I mean, what if she just shows up in a new city with a new identity and kills more people? 
There's not a damn thing we can do without proof. 
Ok. You know what? 
I need to go home and try something. Do you mind? 
No, no, go. Go do what you have to do. 
I promise I'll give you, like, a month off when this is over. 
Call me. 
 I will. 
I really need to talk to you. 
The doctor that killed you, dr. Nora sutherland, 
probably at sisters of angels hospital in san diego... 
I really need to know what happened. 
Any details that I could give the police. 
Dr. Sutherland, did she 
treat your father, also? 
My father? I don't think so. 
Look, you may not be the only person that she did this to, and she could do it again, so please, you have to try I remember getting sick. 
I was in the hospital for a long time. 
We've ruled out a bunch of things, which is good news, but we're still going to have to work you up some more tomorrow. 
I don't want you to worry about anything. 
I'm gonna be with you on this every step of the way. 
I started, like, getting confused, feeling lost. 
She was there every day for me. 
I fell in love with her. 
She made me feel so young, just like I could do anything. 
So what happened? 
I don't know. 
Please. You have to try. 
No, I do know. 
Well, one night she came to me... 
I was so sick that night. 
I couldn't even speak, I was helpless. 
The thing is, like, I still feel love for her, even now, remembering all this. 
I just-I want to know why, how she could do this to me. 
Peter, I really need you to concentrate. 
I need you to see dr. Sutherland, and 
I need you to tell me where she is. 
The bus station. 
Yeah, I'm heading to the bus station. 
It'll probably be the first day that bus is actually on time. 
Jim: Hey, did you ask if the other ghost is his father? 
There is no other ghost. 
Wait a minute... 
both ghosts, same guy. 
I'll explain it later. Bye. 
No, don't walk away! Talk to me. 
It's time for you to do the right thing. 
Peter harrison told me that you injected something into his I. V. Drip, 
that you closed the curtains and that you killed him. 
I did it. 
I killed pete. 
 Why? 
Because he begged me to. 
Isonwas an older man, right? 
Are you really saying you've seen his ghost? 
He kept coming to me as a young man. 
He was really confused, and then... 
then he told me that you made him feel young, so I figured out that's why I saw him as his younger self, ghosts sometimes do that. 
He was 78. 
End stage alzheimer's and a lot of other problems. He was with us for months. 
He had no family, he outlived all of his friends. 
He was truly alone in the world. He just... 
I don't know, he had this spark. 
He had this amazing life, and adventures all over the world. 
Sometimes he would forget he was old. 
He really believed he was a young man, with everything in front of him. 
I never knew anyone like that before. 
I had spent my whole life obsessed with my career. 
I moved through the world with blinders on. 
I never once stopped to look at life the way this crazy, sick old man did. 
And I never looked at it the same way again. 
We became dependant on each other. 
I shouldn't have still been his doctor, but I didn't trust anyone else to be with him. 
Then things got harder. 
The disease progressed, and he sort of... 
withdrew into some place in his head where I couldn't reach him. 
I knew he was suffering. 
I knew he hated what was happening to him. 
One night... 
All of a sudden, it got real clear. 
Let me go. 
Make this stop. 
Please. Kill me. 
I saw so much suffering every day in that hospital. 
Good-bye. 
I held his hand while he died. 
And then I felt the most awful guilt. 
I realized I had violated my oath. 
I had no right to do what I did. 
I didn't think I deserved to be a doctor anymore, so I started over. 
Or at least I tried to. 
You did what I asked you to do. 
And I loved you for it. 
Listen, peter's still here. 
His spirit is with us right now. 
I blamed her. 
At the last second, I I became so afraid. 
Afraid of dying. 
And after I was dead, I couldn't remember why... 
except her giving me that injection. 
He wants you to know how confused he was when he died. 
He thinks I killed him. 
Murdered him! 
But now he knows what really happened. 
He knows that you were just trying to help him. 
Peter, if you can hear me, I am so sorry. 
I never should have done it. 
You gave me so much. 
Tell her how much she gave me just by listening. 
Just by... 
by being there. 
I couldn't have had a better friend. 
She made those last few months so rich. 
He wants you to know how much you gave him. 
Having you as a friend made his last months so rich. 
Having you for a friend made my life so rich, pete. 
I'll never forget you. 
I... I think I have to go now. 
So many old friends waiting for me right over there. 
He's ready to cross over now. 
Does that mean I'll never... 
That he'll never be near me again? 
No! 
Tell her I'll watch over her like a father would. 
The way she watched over me. 
He said you'll always be like a daughter to him. 
He'll always be watching over you. 
I guess I have to go back and own up now, don't I? 
What do you think? 
Jim, I'm sorry. 
That I held things back from you. 
And I know that you don't need to be protected. 
I just feel like I make your life so complicated sometimes, and I was trying to spare you of any more stress than I already bring you. 
You don't bring me any stress, mel. 
Ok, maybe a little. But... 
I can't think of a smaller price to pay for everything else you bring me. 
Really? 
 Yeah. 
You're not gonna get fed up and dump me for one of those girls who only sees ghosts in the movies? 
I'd be bored out my skull in about 10 minutes. 
I know how much it would have meant to you to talk to a relative of the man that died in that building. 
Yeah. 
There's your chance. 
Joe grimaldi? 
He's the brother. 
I can't tell you how much I wanted to get out of there... 
to save him, but he was trapped, and he was really badly hurt. 
And the other guy was going to live. 
I had to make the choice. 
He wasn't going to make it, no matter what, huh? 
No. 
If it helps any, he wasn't in any pain. 
I mean, he wasn't suffering. 
I don't think he had any feeling. 
I'm sorry, joe. 
Did he... 
say anything, my brother? 
No, he wasn't making much sense. 
You know, they're- no, I'm wrong. 
He did say something. 
He said,"I never stopped. Never. " 
Joe? 
 Does that mean something to you? 
I sent my brother a letter asking him to forgive me for the things I said to him. 
And the last thing I wrote in that letter was... 
"I wouldn't blame you if you stopped loving me a long time ago. " 
Do you think that means that... 
yes. He forgave you. 
And you were the last thing he was thinking about when he died. 
I feel like 100 pounds lighter. 
Like everything is... is ok. 
Just thanks. Thanks, ok? 
No problem. 
Congratulations. 
You just made it through your first crossing over. Sort of. 
That's a feeling. I mean... 
just to know you brought somebody a little peace, even by accident. 
Look, um, I don't want you to ever feel like you don't make a difference... 
or that I could make more of a difference than you. 
Sometimes it's just about the little things; the things that you do day in and day out. 
The things that you do every single day. 
That's what makes a real difference in the world. 
You heard me talking to that ghost, didn't you? 
A little. 
Let's go home. 
Don't worry about that.I'll finish up. 
Jim's got the late shift, so no one's waiting at home. 
Oh, i don't mind. 
No one's waiting for me at home, neither. 
Is ned out with his basketball friends? 
Not exactly. 
Ok, what's going on? 
Nothing. 
Or at least that's what i keep telling myself. 
Ned's on a date. 
Like a date-date, with a girl? 
Is it his first one? Because... 
You don't seem very pleased. 
I am trying so hard not to be overprotective. 
Well, what is there to protect him from? He's on a date. 
What's there to protect him from? Are you kidding? 
He could get his heart broken, he could catch a disease. 
And what do i know about this girl? Right? 
She could be into drugs, she could be into self mutilation, She could be into animal sacrifice. 
Animal sacrifice? 
You know what i mean. 
Not really, no. 
What wouldn't a teenage boy do if you promised to take your shirt off? 
What wouldn't jim do now? 
You think this is funny. 
Yes. Look, i love you, but you 
are not making any sense.Ok? 
Ned is a smart kid. 
Besides, it's his first date, right? 
So they probably haven't even held hands yet. 
Was that ok? I mean... 
I hope that it's ok that i kissed you. 
So... It was ok then. 
Um, maybe we can get together again sometime? 
Yeah. I'd like that. 
Great. Awesome. 
I gotta get in, it's late. 
Hey, lisa, you forgot your sweatshirt Lisa? 
I'm just dropping your sweater inside. 
I'll see you at school, ok? 
Your mom just left. 
I know. I watched her go. 
What happened to your nose? 
I walked into a door. 
Here, let me help you. 
Now what happened, really? 
If i tell you something, you promise not to tell her? 
No, i do not keep secrets from your mom, and neither should you. 
It might be about a ghost. 
Well, maybe your mom doesn't need to know about that. 
What happened? 
Ever since i started being with lisa, it's felt like we weren't alone. 
Maybe i'm just a loser who doesn't know how to act around girls, But with all the weird stuff that happens whenever i'm with her; All the accidents and whatever, it's like there's something else going on. 
And then when she told me that her dad had died a while ago. 
Now, i know what you're thinking. 
That you never should have taught me about ghosts, because now i see them everywhere. 
Uh, no, that's--that's not what i was thinking. 
What, did you see something? 
I see things all the time. 
Doesn't have to mean anything. 
How did lisa's father die? 
Some kind of accident. 
She doesn't talk about it much. 
Well, i'll make you a deal. 
Um, if you can stay away from lisa for a little while, i'll look into it for you. 
Come on, why can't i see her? 
Or i can talk to your mother. 
Ok, fine. 
Hey, ned? 
Be careful. 
proudly presents Ghost Whisperer Season03 Episode13 You promise you wouldn't tell about a ghost that's haunting her son? 
Yeah, and i feel even worse that ned's out there unprotected, but what can i do? 
I mean, i can't follow him around all day, And it doesn't do any good to scare delia when i don't know anything. 
Best way i can protect ned is to figure out who this ghost is and cross him over. 
And you think the ghost is ned's girlfriend's father? 
Maybe. Check this out. 
According to this, 2 years ago nathan benton died in his auto repair shop When a car fell on top of him. 
When you saw the ghost, was he wearing a mechanic's uniform? 
No, but that doesn't mean anything. 
He could have died later in the hospital or something. 
What else do you remember about him? 
He had a lot of bruises on his face. 
Kinda like you'd have if a car fell on you? 
Well, i mean that would explain the nasty mood. 
Lisa: why weren't you in campbell's class? 
Ned: oh, i was in the library studying for bio. 
I've got a test tomorrow. 
That's good, because i was beginning to get the feeling that you didn't want to see me. 
Not at all. You have no idea. 
I don't want to scare you away, but... 
My life's been kind of weird lately. 
And it just means a lot to have someone like you; someone who listens, And you make me feel like i have some place safe. 
Oh, my god! 
Oh, my god, ned, this can't happen! 
She's gonna kill me! 
Who, your mom? 
I can't get in trouble! 
You don't know what's going to happen to me! 
Don't worry. I'll just 
say that it was my fault. 
I can't let you do that. 
Maybe it won't matter. Maybe nobody saw. 
Out of the car. Both of you.Now. 
You two are so lucky nobody got hurt. 
Lisa, where's your mom? 
I just called her. 
She should be here any minute. 
Well, i don't know what she's going to do with you, But i can tell you ned is going to pay for his share of the damages. 
Since both of you were in the backseat, it's kind of hard to tell who's at fault. 
 Mom! 
 What, ned? 
Is there something i'm missing here? 
Lisa! Get in the car. 
You're in a lot of trouble. 
Um, excuse me. I'm 
ned's mother.Who are you? 
I'm sorry. My name's 
amy.I'm lisa's sister. 
Where's your mother? 
She's at work, and she feels incredibly bad, but she just couldn't get away. 
She said to tell you she'll call you as soon as she can. 
Ok, well, i hope it's soon. 
Definitely. Bye. 
Ok. 
Start at the beginning, and don't leave anything out. 
Hey, is everything ok with ned? 
Did you tell him that the ghost of his girlfriend's father was haunting him? 
I saw a ghost around ned, and i told him that i would find out if it was haunting him. 
I didn't ask if you saw a ghost. 
I asked if-- we are talking about you keeping secrets with my son, Which frankly, i don't understand how you can do after what happened with his father. 
Ok, i knew that you were going to get upset about this topic, And i shouldn't have kept it from you. 
I'm sorry. 
Ok. 
Look, i know you're trying to help, but next time I will tell you everything i know. 
Ok. 
Well, what do you know? 
Lisa's father died in an accident in his auto repair shop. 
So he knew about cars, which might explain the parking lot business, And it seemed like he had a logical motive Protecting his child. 
From ned? 
I remember that you had the same fears about lisa. 
Yes, and i was right. 
Have you talked to her mother yet? 
She called. She apologized up and down. 
She said it was all her daughter's fault, that she wasn't going to charge ned a thing. 
So we're gonna get together later and talk about it. 
Good. 
Look, melinda, maybe... 
You shoul  go over there and snoop around, you know? 
If there really is a ghost... 
That was my next move. 
Who is it? 
Hi, uh, i'm melinda gordon, a friend of ned banks. 
Oh, hi. 
Ned's talked about you before. 
You work with his mom. 
Are you lisa? 
Did you want to talk to my mom? 
I do, but i'd actually like to talk to you first if you don't mind. 
Can i come in? 
You know what, it's such a nice afternoon. 
 Why don't we just sit out here? 
 Ok. 
Look, i came here because... 
I know that ned likes you, and i want to help. 
So do you mind if i ask you a few questions? 
About what? 
I don't know if you'll understand the connection, but i wanted to know more about your father. 
Hi, i'm amy. 
I'm lisa's sister. 
Did i overhear that you're a friend of ned's? 
Yes, hi. Melinda, nice to meet you. 
Did lisa offer you anything to drink? 
Some tea, maybe? 
You know, i don't think i even gave her the chance, but that would be great, thank you. 
 I'll tell mom you're here. 
 Ok. 
Go say hello, henry. 
Hi, i'm henry. It's nice to meet you. 
Oh, it's nice to meet you. 
I've never met such a polite family. 
Woman: lisa, sweetheart, can i talk to you for a minute? 
That's mom. I'll be right back. 
Ok. 
So, how long have you guys lived in grandview? 
Oh, what was it... 3 years? 
I lose count. 
3 1/2. I was 9. 
Mom says she's getting a migraine. 
She's seeing her shapes and spots. 
Yeah, i think i know what that's like. 
We're going to go help her out. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
You know, i should just come back later, maybe, 'Cause it sounds like you need to go and take care of your mom. 
Yeah. Come back tomorrow 
when she's feeling better. 
Ok. I will. 
Really nice garden. 
I've never seen such beautiful snapdragons. 
Oh, they're hybrids. Thanks. 
Are you a friend of the bentons? 
A new friend, yes. 
They haven't had the best of luck, have they? 
Hmm, not really. 
You know, i didn't know nathan... Very well. 
What was he like? 
He wasn't a very nice person. 
Not just to me. 
What does that mean? 
He was always yelling at me to trim my trees, even if they hung over one inch into his yard. 
Said he was afraid that the branches were going to fall on the kids, but honestly! 
So he was a little overprotective. 
You should have seen the way he treated those kids. 
I have never seen anything like it. 
He didn't let them out of that house for the whole first month that they lived there, Not even for a minute. I mean... 
I'm not saying things are any easier for karen now. 
She has to work 2 shifts at that phone rep job just to support the kids. But... 
I think things are starting to look up. 
How so? 
Well, i see her getting dressed up and going out every once in a while. 
I think she's finally met someone. 
And she's gardening again, and she says the sweetest things about my flowers, and my trees. 
Good to hear. 
Thanks. 
Stay away! 
My family belongs to me! 
The ghost is behaving in death the same way he did in life Overprotective, smothering, controlling. 
Yeah, but the weird part is, it's like they all knew he was there. 
How do you mean? 
Well, if he's dead, you know, why be on your best behavior? 
These kids were being so polite. 
And the mom, when she got her migraine, said that she was seeing shapes and spots. 
I mean, maybe she's actually just seeing a manifestation of him. 
Is that possible? 
I don't know. 
But if he moves enough stuff around, they don't have to see him to know he's there. 
Yeah. 
Well, you know you're describing the behavior of an abuser. 
That's exactly what i was thinking. 
Well, they isolate people from any relationship that will take their victims away from them. 
Well, i know he doesn't want lisa to be with ned, And i'm guess he's not a big fan of his wife's new boyfriend. 
And you. 
I'll be careful, ok? 
 I promise. 
 Ok. 
 Have a good day. 
 You, too. 
Hi, delia. 
I know you're down here. 
Nathan? 
Please talk to me. 
I just want to help you. 
I want to help your family. 
Melinda, are you ok? 
What happened to you? 
I don't... Know. 
A vision, i think? 
I was reliving someone else's experience. 
Of what? 
Of being hit, knocked to the ground. 
Is this about ned's ghost? 
Is ned in any kind of danger? 
This is so wrong. 
It's so totally unfair. 
No, it's not, ned. 
If your child was in danger, you'd do the very same thing. 
In danger from what? 
From the whole bad situation! 
What situation? 
The house, that family, everything. 
You mean the ghost. 
Ok, the ghost. 
You're such a hypocrite! 
First you yell at melinda for talking to me about ghosts, And now you say i can't see lisa because of one. 
What am i supposed to think? 
The first time you see her, you get your nose bloody. 
It wasn't the first time. 
The first 5 times you had no problem, until i said the word "date," And all of a sudden you started freaking out. 
Yes, and then the next time you saw her, you get into a car accident. 
I have been trying to meet with her mother ever since, and she keeps rescheduling on me! 
She's a widow trying to raise her kids alone, just like you. 
She is not like me, ned. 
I keep my appointments. 
What are you really afraid of, mom? Tell me. 
Because i'm pretty sure it's not ghosts. 
I am not afraid of anything. 
Good. Then i can see lisa. 
No. No, ned, you can't. 
Try and stop me. 
Ned... 
Ned, come back here! 
She's so overprotective, it's nuts. 
She won't let me out of her sight. 
I feel ya. 
Your mom ever get like that? 
My mom, my dad. 
I hope it's ok melinda came over. 
She wanted to ask about your dad. 
Ned, do you ever think that maybe your mom might be right? 
About being with me? 
No way. Why? 
Remember i told you before that my family... 
My life's been a little bit weird lately? 
Yeah. 
Never mind. 
Look, i can't explain. 
Maybe we should just try and be friends. 
Lisa, wait. 
Whatever it is you don't think you can tell me, maybe i'd understand. 
Maybe i already do. 
I'm sorry, i gotta go. 
Nathan? 
I know you feel like you're doing what's best for your family and your children. 
Maybe you think you're being a good parent. 
But you're not. 
You're hurting them, still. 
Uh, excuse me? 
But what are you doing here? 
Amy. Look, um... 
I know that you lost your dad, and that's hard for you and your mom. 
But i think you've seen some things and felt some things that Maybe you can't explain, and that's really scary. 
No, no, what's scary is you, sneaking into our yard when our mom isn't here And asking us all sorts of weird questions. 
I really need you to hear this. 
Your father is still here, i've seen him. 
What are you talking about? 
I know it sounds strange, but i can see ghosts. 
You've seen dad? 
What does he look like? 
She's lying. Don't ask her that. 
I can only see them the way that they died, which means that he may not look how you remember  im. 
He's wearing a sweatshirt, and there's bruises on his face Ok, you know what... 
You need to leave. 
Come on, let's go inside. 
Amy, please just tell your mom. 
If you don't, i will.But your 
Your father needs help crossing into the light. 
I said... Leave. 
Hey, i got your call. What's wrong? 
We didn't want to admit it, but you and melinda, you sorta guessed right. 
Things aren't right at our house. 
Admit what? Lisa? 
Mom's gone. She's missing. 
We were afraid to tell anyone, 'cause people might say she's not a fit mom. 
What people? 
Social services. 
People like that. 
See, she started seeing this guy. 
His name's steve, but he lives out of town, like an hour's drive. 
She wanted to be with him. 
We said that it would be ok on our own for a night, but we haven't seen her since. 
How long's she been gone? 
2 days. 
We keep calling her cell, and nothing. 
I don't know what to do, ned. I don't know what to do. 
First thing? 
We tell the police. 
Keep your eye on the kids. Take them with you. 
Really? They had to bring the kids here? 
They just need somebody to identify the mother's belongings. 
Her belongings? What did they find? 
Nothing. Her purse is on the front 
seat, keys are in the ignition, Driver's side door is wide open, there's not a scratch on this car, And the engine started right up. 
The kids say she was on her way to meet her boyfriend. 
So do they think she was carjacked, the police, or kidnapped? 
Probably, but, uh... 
More important, do you? 
No That's the good news. 
Bad news is... 
He's here. 
Thank you. And thank 
you very much for coming. 
Man: absolutely. 
Hey, henry. Are you ok? 
Yeah. 
What book are you reading? 
It's nothing. 
Can i see it? 
Memory book for dad. 
Did you make this? 
We all did. 
It's beautiful. 
You really loved your dad, didn't you? 
Must be hard... 
To hear things that are critical. 
It's hard to hear things that arewrong. 
What do you mean? 
My dad wasn't like that. 
He wasn't mean or scary. 
He was awesome. 
Well, i-- i really want to believe that, but... 
What about when you first moved here? 
I mean, someone told me that he wouldn't even let you out of the house. 
We had measles. Of course not. 
You had measles? 
Yeah. That's when we made 
our first memory book. 
I think it was called the great outdoors. 
Dad quit his job to come home and stay with us until we got better. 
those flowers... 
Amy: oh, my god, mom. Oh, my god! 
I'm so glad you're ok! 
Where have you been? 
The whole town's been going nuts worrying! 
You called. 
No, no there are no messages, we didn't get any. 
When are you coming home? 
Ok. 
Ok, well, call back as soon as you can. 
I'm so glad you're ok. I love you. 
Bye. 
That was mom! 
She's ok! She's coming home! 
Henry: that's great! 
She's all right. Awesome. 
Bye. Thanks.Bye. 
You guys... 
She's still here. 
Everybody's left. Is 
there something you need? 
Morning glories. 
Were those one o  her favorites? 
Your mom? 
You know, i noticed them before. 
It just... Didn't hit me. 
These only bloom early in the morning, and the sun's pretty high in the sky right now, and look at 'em. 
Wide open, beautiful. 
Her spirit's affecting them. 
They can sense her just like you have. 
Wait, so first you're seeing dad's ghost, and now you're--you're saying you're seeing mom's? 
Was it cancer? 
Is that how she lost all her hair? 
'Cause i saw a picture of her inside, and she looks so different now. 
She's still sick? 
 Is she hurting? 
 Henry... 
No, sweetheart. 
She's not hurting anymore. 
All the pain's gone. 
No, i just talked to mom, she's fine. 
Yeah, i found this, where you left it. 
There was an outgoing call made to this house at exactly the same time You said you were on the phone with your mom. 
Ok. Whatever you think you're 
doing for us, we're not interested. 
 We're going inside, come on! 
 Is this how she wanted it? 
She wanted her death to be a secret? 
Is that why you buried her here? 
You guys... 
How could you be so stupid? 
How could you bring her here? 
Is she here? 
How long have they lived alone? 
They're not alone, that is the whole point! 
You've ruined everything! 
You've destroyed my family! 
So one call from you and police send over their burliest men with picks and shovels. 
I said you told me the truth, so for your own sake, please don't make me a liar. 
You said your mom was sick. 
She fought it so hard. 
She had so many rounds of chemo, and that's why she lost her hair. 
She got weak and thin, and any little thing would bruise her. 
Why? It's not fair! 
So the spirit you saw... 
We knew you were talking about your mom, And we knew it would only be a matter of time before you realized that, too. 
So you pretended she was kidnapped. 
You weren't the only one looking for her, so we had to buy time, figure out what to do. 
What made you decide to hide her death? 
It was mom's idea. 
She wanted us to be together no matter what. 
How long have you guys been on your own? 
Mom died last fall. 
We wanted her to always be with us. 
It was the only way to keep her close. 
I'm gonna be 18 in a few months, and the  i can legally file for custody. 
How many months? 
i don't understand. 
The neighbors said that she saw your mother leaving on dates. 
We had a sitter. 
She'd come at night and help henry with his homework and do some grocery shopping. 
And let me guess, she just happens to look like your mom. 
So the voice that i heard coming from inside the house, the woman on the phone with delia, The one that's been talking to all the neighbors, that's--that's all you. 
Mom taught me how to do her job. 
She taught me how to be her. 
Mom knew she was dying. 
Her job has benefits health insurance. 
And it's not like we're stealing. 
I'm doing the work. 
And the house is kept clean, we're fed, lisa and henry get straight as. 
What about you? 
How many days of school have you missed? 
Do you even have friends anymore? 
I'm fine. 
We're fine. 
And it's hard, but mom was tough, so we have to be tough, too. 
You're not fine. 
Look around you. 
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in? 
mom! 
Mom! 
Henry Henry, wait. 
I warned you to leave them alone. 
I couldn't, because you did. 
Look, i didn't know that you were sick, and i'm sorry that you died, But you have to move on, you have to let them go. 
Go? Go where? 
Do you have any idea what you're talking about? 
There are people who will take care of them. 
The county, you mean. 
Didn't you have any relatives? Did your husband? 
There's no one. 
Well, what about friends? 
I mean, you went through the trouble of doing all this planning. 
Didn't you make out a will or specify any custody? 
Do you think i didn't try? 
Who wants 3 grieving orphans in their home? 
The system can hardly place 2 siblings together. 
There's a social worker now. 
I just wanted them to stay a family. 
That doesn't have to change. 
You couldn't be more wrong. 
Lisa: i just wanted to say i'm sorry. 
I couldn't tell you, i just couldn't. 
Ned: no, i feel bad. 
If i hadn't pushed to get closer, maybe you guys could have just gone alone. 
None of this would have happened if i didn't like you so much. 
I do, ned. 
You hear me, right? 
Yeah. I hear you. 
I have to go. 
Can i see you tomorrow? 
I'd love that. 
You kids are incredible. 
You didn't let me cook, at least let me clean up. 
We have an alternating chore list. 
We like to stick to it. 
Look, i--i know that foster care sounds... 
Scary, but it's not. 
I don't know very much about it. 
Yeah, the social worker seemed nice. 
Let me get that. 
To think after all these months you were here by yourself, it just breaks my heart. 
Lisa, we should take henry upstairs and get his schoolwork together for the social worker tomorrow. 
Oh, well, i'll come up and help you kids. 
This lock is broken. 
Could you have mr. Alden fix it? 
Oh, i'm not sure.I, um 
could you call him? 
Because if they take us from the house tomorrow and the door's broken, someone might break in. 
 Oh, yeah, ok. 
 Thanks. 
Come on, guys, it's late. 
Hi, honey, can you call me on the cell? 
I'm over here with those poor kids, are you all right? 
Amy: yeah, we're fine. 
Um, there's a fuse box in the cellar. Can you get it? 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, honey, i'll get it. 
Come on. 
Did you get the tickets? 
 Where are we going? 
 Just walk. 
The cashier at the bus station cut up the credit card. 
"deceased," she said. 
I took off before she could call security. 
It's ok, we still have cash. 
How much cash? 
How long can it last us? 
Just keep walking. 
Where are we going to go, what are we going to do? 
I don't know. We'll figure it out. 
What about the house? 
What about mom and dad's stuff? What about our life here? 
Don't you get it? That's already gone. 
We're not gonna be in that house. 
And you can pack up your stuff and take it to some orphanage or halfway house  or whatever will take you. 
 All right, stop. 
You're scaring me. 
Yeah, well, you should be scared. 
Because if you think you're gonna end up with a nice family with lisa tucking you in every night,  You're not. 
 Shut up. 
Look... 
I'm almost 18, but you guys... 
Who's going to want you Freaks who stuck their own mother in the ground. 
Now, i'm scared, too, but this is what mom told us to do. 
We have to stick together, we have to be tough. 
Ok. 
We have to go. 
Henry? Henry?Henry! 
Where'd he go? 
Henry? Henry? 
Henry: sorry, you guys. 
But i just can't do this anymore. 
Yeah, murph overheard the a.d.a 
and the social worker talking. 
Medical records have confirmed their mom had cancer, Nobody wants to press charges, but lockin' up the neighbor? 
It was the ghost. 
Yeah, but they could charge amy with a crime. 
Try her as an adult. 
She's here. 
 Can you give me a second? 
 Yeah. 
They're splitting them up! 
Henry's going to some foster home, while amy and lisa are being detained. 
I knew it! 
This is what happens to families when both parents die! 
You can't control their lives anymore, and every time you do, you just make it worse. 
The best thing that you can do is just help them understand what's happening to them. 
You're the one who doesn't understand! 
You keep saying that, but understand what? 
What is it that you're not telling me? 
Because you're afraid of something, and it has nothing to do with the county. 
Or is itsomeone? 
Is it someone who'd get them when you died? 
I need to talk to the officer who found henry. 
Sure, what's up? 
This ghost is hiding a lot more than her death. 
OK she kept saying she knew this would happen, the kids would get torn apart. 
Officer: actually, the country prefers to keep siblings together. 
Where was she getting her information? 
Well, that's what i was wondering, but then it made me think, what if she has someone? 
A sibling who is in foster care or adopted, someone that the kids never knew? 
You're talking about family services records. They're sealed. 
Come on. Not for you. 
Please. 
That little boy had everything to lose when he came to you for help. 
He's lost so much already. 
Hi, are you tracy edmondson? 
Yes. 
My name is melinda gordon. 
I knew your sister karen. 
My sister? 
There's so many questions. I... 
I'm not honestly sure i want to know the answers. 
She had 3 children. 
Their father died, too. They have no one. 
You didn't know that, did you? 
You're not one of the people she asked to take care of them. 
She probably figured i'd say no. 
Because you didn't take her when your parents died? 
I know about the accident. 
I know that you were 19 when you lost them. 
You were old enough to take over custody. 
I sat in a courtroom while the judge asked her over and over if she wanted me. 
She cried every night until she passed out from exhaustion. 
And they were my parents, too. 
I could barely function. 
How was i supposed to fix her broken heart? 
I don't think anyone expected you to do that. 
Except maybe you. 
Well, it's too late now. She's gone. 
What if it wasn't too late just meet her kids. 
They're really... 
Really self sufficient and loving. 
And they need you to be their family. 
Legally, it's the only way they can stay together. 
She is a complete stranger to them. 
I'm not their family. 
If karen were here, she'd tell you i'm not her family. 
I gave up that right. 
Listen to her. She's right. 
So... 
I can't. I don't... 
Deserve a second chance? 
You all do. 
What are you doing? 
Oh, i'm just picking up ned. 
He wanted to help lisa's aunt move the rest of her  tuff in. 
Are you guys ok? 
I mean, did he ever apologize for just walking out? 
No, actually, i apologized to him. 
Yeah, he was right. 
It was just very hard for me to think of him... 
Dating. 
Is that why you're looking this way? 
'Cause you literally can't face the idea of ned having a girlfriend? 
No, i am trying to give them their privacy. 
This is me... Letting go. 
So what are they doing? Are they kissing? 
Uh, no, she just hit him. 
Oh, thank god. 
But it was full of sexual tension. 
Ned, come on, let's go! 
We're late for practice! 
What? We are! 
I don't know, melinda. 
I think they just want to be left alone. 
Maybe, maybe not. 
I remember when dad came to pick you up, and you had all that gum stuck in your braces. 
Yeah, but i won the contest. 
 Yeah. 
 Ok, now mom. 
I rember mom taking henry to work one day. 
i love this one. 
And you gave her computer a big drink of grape juice. 
Please don't stop because of me. 
Oh, no. 
It's just a family thing we do, just the three of us. 
Tell her tracy is her family. 
Tell her she might remember some things they'll want to hear. 
Amy, uh... 
Your mom wants you to let your aunt play. 
Lisa: wait, mom's here? 
Where is she? 
I remember... 
I remember making up a game with your mother. 
It was called "i rember." 
Sweetheart, listen. 
'Cause after our parents died, i told your mother to rember one thing about each of them every night Before she went to sleep, and that way, they would be with her always. 
Even if i couldn't be. 
Youmade up the game? 
Tell them to listen to their aunt, because she knows the story about When we camped out on copper island with mom and dad. 
Tracy... 
Can you tell them the story about camping on copper island? 
Oh, come on, aunt tracy! What's the deal? 
'Cause mom always hated camping. 
Well, how do you think she learned to hate it? 
I remember your mother, a rope swing, and a giant bed of poison ivy that She fell into, because... 
What is that? 
It's so beautiful. 
It's time, isn't it? 
Only you know that. 
There's room over here, aunt tracy. 
come on, tracy. Sit down. 
Yeah, tell us more. 
What's wrong? 
Keeler. 
He's bringing your ex-husband into this debate. 
The SEC's investigation into his company. 
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust that the people will be able to tell the difference. 
Jack, what's going on? 
Where's Tony? 
He's been shot. 
 How bad? 
 He was hit in the neck. 
He's still alive, they're getting him to the hospital now. 
With Tony down, you're in command. 
Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Van Nuys dam. 
Whoever sent this message is controlling Kyle Singer's movements. 
We have two hours to find him before they release the virus. 
What are you into Kyle? 
These cops, they came to my apartment today and they were saying something about... using me to, 
to bring some weird disease into the country. 
A disease...? 
Go! Run! 
I didn't do anything, man! 
No! Stop! 
 You're going to see Salazar? 
 Yeah. 
My dad said questioning him was a waste of time. 
No. Sitting around here 
is a waste of time. 
Kim, I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document. 
What's this about? 
I need to move Ramon Salazar. 
This has top priority clearance. 
No one at CTU is supposed to know. 
Either I hand over Ramon Salazar or his brother will release the virus. 
I understand that this is an impossible choice. 
I have another option for you to consider. 
Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison and delivered to him. 
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack, but who'll break Salazar out? 
I will, sir. 
This would be my last assignment. 
If you play this cool, Ramon, you're walking out of here with me. 
Open the cell blocks now. 
Let's go. Move! 
The following takes place between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm Good evening to those of you on the east coast and good afternoon to those of you in the west. 
Welcome to first of three debates between President Palmer and Senator John Keeler. 
We'll begin tonight with a two minute opening statement followed by the first question which will go to President David Palmer as decided by a coin flip backstage just moments ago. 
How're you feeling? 
Is that a medical question or a personal one? 
Both. 
I'm fine. 
That will be conducted within formats of rules agreed to by each member of the debate and by the two campaigns. 
Now we will bring to the stage the candidates. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John Keeler. 
David, I'm sorry you have to deal with my ex-husband's lies. 
It's alright. 
We have the truth on our side. 
Ladies and gentlemen, President David Palmer. 
Thank you, John. 
Good luck tonight. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Keeler. 
Good evening. 
I'm looking forward to discussing some of the critical issues... 
When I tell you to, you start fighting with me over the gun. 
I gotta try and pull two guards off the main corridor. 
Okay. They're coming. 
Help! Help! Help! 
That's enough! 
Put on his uniform and helmet now! 
Split up your men. 
I want a team at every security. 
No, Jack and Salazar are somewhere on east block. 
You need to put your men over there. 
I got to control this prison, your partner is not my only problem. 
Warden, today he is. 
He and Salazar need to be contained and they need to be kept alive. 
You want me to redeploy my men? 
Then I need to know how real this terrorist threat is. 
Come here. 
Ramon Salazar's brother will spread a deadly virus into the population unless we release him unharmed. 
If we don't the death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands. 
This is Warden Mitchell. 
Tactical unit five, report to control center. 
You're now under the command of agent Edmunds. 
Thank you. 
 Yeah? 
 Chase, it's Michelle. 
What the hell is going on over there? 
Jack tried to bring Salazar out of prison. 
 He started a riot. 
 What? 
I think in his own twisted way he thinks he's gonna deliver him to Hector and stop the virus from being released. 
Well he's gonna get himself killed not to mention Salazar. 
I know. 
I know, I'm trying to protect him. 
What about Kyle Singer? 
We're getting close to locating him. 
Michelle as soon as you do, call me. 
If Jack knows we got the carrier of the virus he'll give Salazar back. 
We got everyone working on it Chase. 
 We'll find him. 
 Okay. 
I'm sorry, Linda. 
Linda. 
Am I gonna die? 
It depends... 
if they find us in time. 
What do you mean? 
The guy from the government... 
He told my dad that I had a couple of more hours before I... 
Before I become contagious. 
Maybe they'll find us by then. 
You'll be okay. 
Yeah... 
maybe. 
What are you doing? 
There must be some wires in here. 
What do you need wire for? 
To get you out of this. 
Adam. Look at this. 
Got it from a Caltrans server. 
Traffic camera, right near the mall. 
Look at that. 
It's a blue shirt. Isn't that 
what Kyle Singer was wearing? 
Yeah. 
I think there's enough to enhance. 
Release it to my screen. 
Got it. 
 Kim. 
 Yes. 
I need you a second. 
You got this? 
 Yeah. 
 Alright. 
Is something wrong? 
You haven't been following what's going on at the prison, have you? 
No, Adam and I have been working on finding Singer. 
Why, what is it? 
Your dad's trying to break out Salazar. 
What? 
Yeah, he's not out yet but he's acting on his own authority. 
He's trying to remove Salazar by force. 
I don't understand what you mean "by force". 
Looks like he started a prison riot to cover the escape. 
Why is he doing this? 
That's what we're trying to figure out. 
When's the last time you heard from him? 
About a half hour ago. 
He asked me to issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar and he gave me a password. 
And you did it? 
Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved. 
But now you're telling me this isn't true? 
No, Kim. I'm sorry. 
Your dad lied to you. 
Why would he do that? 
Because he knew if he asked anybody else they would know he was violating protocol. 
What's gonna happen to him? 
We're gonna try to find him. 
The best way out of this whole situation is to find Kyle Singer. 
Then your dad will give up Salazar. 
So go back to work, help Adam. 
Yeah, sure. 
We're clear. 
We gotta find all their forces through one entrance to keep the personnel count. 
There must be another way, Jack. 
There is, but the prisoners have taken control. 
We're gonna have to fight our way through them. 
Get ready. 
Hit them up. 
Come on. 
Come on. Get them on their feet. 
Come on, let's go, let's go! 
Move, move it! 
Let's go! 
Hold your fire! 
We have hostages so back off! 
Hold your fire! 
Come on man! 
We can make it through. 
We've got to move. 
Let's go! 
Move! Let's go! 
Go! 
Move it! Move it! 
And in order to do this, our fossil fuels most be conserved. 
Kim, did you send me that Kalman filter? 
What? 
The Kalman filter, I needed to clean up that image. 
Oh, shoot! I forgot about it. 
It's in my help box. 
How can you forget about it? 
It's the only thing you're working on. 
I'm sorry, look... 
I'm sending it to you, right now. 
Done. 
Kim, I don't know where your head is at, but we need to find Kyle Singer before he's contagious. 
Relax! I'm doing the best I can. 
The best I can isn't what we do around here, Kim. 
 It's either done or it's not. 
 So why are you lecturing me, it's in your system. 
Kaufman. 
Is there a problem? 
I just need to make sure things are running smoothly around here... 
Look, Adam. 
I haven't had the chance to brief you but... 
Jack created a situation over at the prison. 
What kind of situation? 
He started a riot to free Salazar. 
Now they're caught up in the middle of it. 
Wow. 
He even used Kim to create a transfer order that started the whole thing. 
So cut her a little slack. 
Umm... 
Yeah, okay, I understand. 
We're all under a lot of pressure here. 
So let's just find Kyle Singer before it's too late. 
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Michelle. 
Kyle, what are you doing? 
There's no way out of here. 
You don't deserve what happened. 
I do. 
If I die�� the virus is dying with me! 
Kyle! 
Kyle! 
Put your feet up here! 
Kyle! 
Kyle, hold on. 
Oh, Kyle. 
A "Welcome Home" party? 
You shouldn't be doing this. 
What are you talking about? 
You've been running things. 
Show Ramon you're gonna be his partner. 
Not his caterer. 
Why do you care? 
You don't want to be involved in my business. 
No, puppy, I care about you. 
And I want you to get what you've earned. 
 Yes? 
 It's me. 
Riot's still going on. 
But we know Ramon's alive. 
Yeah. 
But Bauer's got to get him out soon. 
CTU is getting close to finding Kyle Singer. 
And if they do, they'll never let Ramon go. 
Then make sure they don't find Singer. 
 I'm working on it. 
 Get it done. 
That's him, that's Singer. 
Was that a gun? 
Yeah. 
Someone's got him. 
We're not gonna be able to get the truck's license plate from this shot. 
I'll get access to the traffic cameras in the direction they're heading. 
See if we can find them again. 
 Dessler. 
 Michelle. 
We found Kyle Singer being driven away from the mall, 47 minutes ago. 
Are you working up a vehicle ID? 
We will, as soon as we're able to get any visual. 
This camera's damaged. It's malfunctional. 
Must have the hostages on the right. 
Try and pan the camera over. 
They may see the camera move. 
We don't have a choice. Do it. 
There they are. 
We got to get in there before they start killing everyone. 
Come on! Come on! 
Faster! Faster! 
Let's start wasting the guards unless they let us walk First step outside, bang! 
Headshot from a sniper. 
You don't know that. 
I know, cause that's what went down in Chino They'll let the guard get wasted cause all they care about is keeping us in. 
What the hell are we doing here then? 
Give me your gun. 
Bring them over here. 
We're gonna have a little fun with them. 
Put them on their knees. 
Who wants to live? 
Okay. 
Let's try it again. 
 Who wants to live? 
 Me. 
I do. 
Him. Over here. 
Come on. 
Who else? 
I've never seen you before. 
I'm new here. 
Him. Over here. 
One in six chance. 
You first. 
Please. 
Don't make me do this man. 
There's nothing to it, you little bitch. 
 Just put the gun to your head. 
 I can't! 
I can't... 
You're gonna do it. 
You hear me? 
 You're gonna do it. 
 Please, please. 
It's easy, see? 
All you gotta do is smile... 
and pull the trigger. 
Now it's one in five. 
Let's go! 
No! 
No, I can't... 
I can't... 
 This is a waste of my time. Shoot him. 
 No, wait! 
 Shoot him! 
 Wait! 
Come on, man. 
Just do it. 
This way at least you've got a chance, okay? 
Do it. 
Come on! 
If you're not gonna do it, we will. 
We have a winner. 
Let's hear it for the new guy. 
We're now seeing concrete results. 
This is a road we will continue to travel. 
I got a shot coming in from a camera at the next intersection definitely the same truck. 
Can you read the license plate? 
We won't be able to read anything until it finishes downloading. 
I just saw the IAD inquiry coming over the system about what you're father's doing at the prison. 
They're questioning the transfer you generated for him. 
I heard. 
If you want me to say that you didn't know he was gonna use it to break out Salazar�� I will. 
Thanks. I'll be okay. 
Hold on. It stopped downloading, 
I'm getting an error message. 
Error 402 that... 
means trouble with the internal router. 
Gael. 
What are you doing? 
There's a problem with one of the routers. 
I'm trying to fix it. 
Why don't you call Tech. 
No, it's okay. 
I think I found the problem. 
Checks on circuit kicked in. 
Must have been one of the line surge. 
Should be up and running now. 
Let me know if you have any more problems. 
I will. 
Hey, it's back up. What was it? 
I'm not sure. 
Is it possible a line surge could have knocked out a router? 
Well not from my side, you can ask Chloe? 
Got it. 
Hold on. 
Dessler. 
Michelle, I've got a plate on the pick up. 
Good, where do you last have it? 
The shots on the north part of Santa Fe Springs, it was driving west. 
Okay, I want you to put this out to mobile units LAPD. 
I want everyone looking for this vehicle. 
Okay, right. 
Alright, Ryan, I'm back. 
So do you have any idea if Bauer is trying to break out Salazar on his own or if he is working with someone? 
I'm trying to figure that out now. 
 I'll get back to you when I found out. 
 You do that. 
Chloe? 
Yeah, Michelle? 
Are you following what's going on at the prison? 
I just saw the update come over. 
What the hell's happening? 
We don't have all the details yet but Jack's behind it. 
I need you to check his phone logs, e-mail�� See what case files he's accessed recently. 
What am I looking for? 
Anything that'll help us figure out why he's doing this. 
Are you sure? You really want 
me snooping in his office? 
Yes. 
You got it. 
Surgery? 
Yeah, this is Tony Almedia's wife Michelle. 
 How's he doing? 
 Ah... I'll check. One moment please. 
 Mrs. Almeida? 
 Yeah? 
He's still in surgery. 
You'll be contacted as soon as he's rolled into recovery. 
What room is he in? 
Umm... Operating room 4. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Network ops, Evan. 
 Yeah, Evan, it's Michelle. 
Do you know if we get all our feeds from Good Samaritan? 
Let me check. 
Yeah, they do. 
What do you need? 
See if they're video docu-ing OR4. 
Yeah, they are. 
Where do you want it? 
 Send it to my desk top. 
 Alright. It'll take a second. 
Right, there you go. 
Anything else? 
 No. Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 Four by four. 
 More pressure. 
 Hold that down. 
 I've got it. / There you go. 
Do you have another clamp? 
Clamp. 
The laundry room's a hundred yards in. 
I'll ID the exact locations for the explosives once we get there. 
Yes, sir. 
Sir, we're ready for you. 
Monitor's up. 
You should be seeing it on your IPC. 
 It's working. 
 Okay. 
Alright, let's go. 
Radio silence while we're in there. 
If they hear us, they might kill everyone. 
 Copy that. 
 Yes, sir. 
Let's go. 
Alright! 
Round two! 
Then you. 
I'm a prisoner, not a guard. 
I'm Ramon Salazar. 
 I'm sure you've heard of me. 
 You should pick someone else, he's telling you the truth. 
He's just transferred to cell block less than a week ago. 
I'm a federal agent, I was escorting him out of the prison. 
That's why you've never seen us here before. 
Good. 
Federal agent. 
What's your name? 
Jack Bauer. 
Alright. 
It's gonna be agent Jack against Ramon Salazar. 
A battle to the finish! 
Come on, Jack. 
Show this foreigner how it's done. 
If I die,  my brother will find you. 
 Shut up! 
Do it! 
Alright. 
You're up. 
Looks like your mother's a title, Jack. 
Ramon, stay down! 
Come on! 
All clear! 
Hold your fire! 
Jack! 
Jack! 
I have no triumphs. 
Only defeats. 
God! 
 Lab. 
 This is Chloe O'Brian. 
I'm in Jack's office. 
Could you send someone up the drug kit, please? 
It's on its way. 
The differences on the issues are clear. 
But I believe you don't elect a platform. 
You elect a man. 
And I am frankly troubled by some of the personal choices that this president has made and continues to make. 
We're all aware of the allegations and indictments surrounding the President's former wife. 
Most of us have operated under the assumption that the President will not repeat his history of associating with the persons of questionable moral character. 
However, my office has just learned that the woman with whom the President is currently involved, Doctor Anne Packard is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial. 
A drug which later led to the deaths of three innocent people. 
This is outrageous. 
This debate is not a court of law nor is it a tabloid paper. 
This is neither the time nor the place to launch a personal attack on a private citizen. 
Mr. President 
the Senator still has 30 more seconds. 
Sir, please. 
This is exactly the right time. 
Because I believe the choices your leaders make in their own lives reflect the choices that they will make on your behalf. 
And so the question remains. 
Did the President know of these accusations and choose to ignore them? 
Or is he repeating past mistakes once again? 
Mr. President your rebuttal. 
I can tell you with complete confidence that the Senator's accusation is false. 
And that I believe it is the Senator's way of aborting the issues at hand. 
Now I came here tonight to discuss the real issues pressing our country. 
Oh, god. 
 I assume that the Senator was... 
 Now do you get it? 
I do not believe this is something to be swept under the rug and forgotten. 
It's positive. 
I'll go tell Michelle. 
Chloe, what are you doing in my dad's office? 
Michelle wanted me to go through your dad's stuff. 
Why? 
To find anything that can help us understand what he's doing. 
What's up? 
I wanted to know if a line surge could shut down a router on your side of the ITS room. 
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs. 
Not in my ITS. 
Why? 
Ah, it's probably nothing. 
Did you find anything? 
I can't talk about this. 
Why not, maybe I can help. 
You can't help so just go, okay? 
What's in the box? 
Just stuff I'm taking to Michelle. 
This is really an inappropriate behavior, Kim. 
Why are you doing this, Chloe? 
I mean... 
I'm just trying to help you. 
You can't help. 
And I don't have to have this conversation. 
Under field op mandate, there's a regulation. 
I believe it's 40 or 41 that says that I have jurisdictional prerogative. 
So could you just leave? 
Not until you tell me what's in the box. 
I think your dad's been using drugs. 
 What? 
 That's right. 
Rubber tourniquet, syringe. 
We just had the vials tested of opiates, It was positive. 
He's been acting really weird. Okay? 
It's really not fair you made me do this. 
It's very uncomfortable. 
Michelle? 
I didn't find anything in Jack's records but there is something you need to see. 
You found this in his office? 
I wanted to make sure what it was before I showed you. 
The liquid in these vials tested positive for opiates. 
Probably heroine. 
I think Jack's a user. 
I got it. 
A patrol car just found the truck Kyle Singer was in parked in a industrial complex in Fuller and fourth 2000 block. 
Pipe these into the teams on standby. 
Assume everyone on the site is contagious and use level 1 CDC protocol. 
Let's get him! 
Damn! 
Is there any other way out? 
No, we're pinned in. 
We must have known this could happen. 
What's the plan, Jack? 
Give me the shotgun. 
Give me the shotgun. 
Take off your uniform. 
I have worked the past year with my administration on my overall academic plan. 
The projection could not look better. 
 Dessler. 
 This is Cowgil. 
Approaching the industrial complex on Fuller. 
There are three warehouses on the property. 
I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared. 
Roger. 
Kaufman. 
Adam, see if you can pull up an infrared satellite on the industrial complex. 
On it. 
Kim, log into the NHA server. 
We need to see if they have any satellites in position. 
Kim! 
Okay. 
What's the matter? 
Nothing, I'm fine. 
We just swept these blocks. 
There's no sign of Jack or Salazar. 
Look I got a team in the assault block. 
They can't do a proper search until we lock it down. 
That can take up to a half hour. 
If you want to get out of this thing, you gonna have to trust me. 
And do everything that I tell you. 
You understand? 
Alright. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Okay, here's what I want you to do. 
I want you to take that chopper and I want you sweep the perimeter. 
Chase! 
 What are you doing, Jack? 
 You get these people to move back. 
Or you're gonna have to take me out. 
We need that chopper. 
Don't do this. 
I just spoke with Michelle, we're close to getting Kyle Singer. 
Close ain't gonna cut it this time. 
I gotta deliver Salazar now! 
I'm not letting you go, Jack! 
How long is it gonna take to find Kyle Singer? 
A half an hour? An hour? 
I gotta get Salazar in the air, in that chopper in the next 60 seconds. 
Or hundred thousand people will die. 
 Let him go. 
 Let him go? 
Let him go. 
We'll track the chopper. I need you to 
keep your people under control, Warden. 
Please. 
I can't have anything happen to Salazar. 
Alright. 
This is Warden Mitchell, I want all teams to stand down. 
I repeat, stand down! 
Agent Bauer will take Salazar to the SWAT chopper. 
I want a conformation from all teams on the stand down order. 
Let him take the chopper. 
Stand down. 
Alright? Back off. 
Alright, Jack. 
No one's gonna try and stop you. 
Get these men to back off and holster their weapons. 
Back off! Stand down! 
Let them through! 
Let's go. 
 Get them to holster their weapons. 
 Holdster your weapons! 
 Lower your weapon! 
 Stand down! 
Get the snipers down, off the roof, now! 
 Now! 
 Off the roof! Get off the roof! 
Back off! 
Do what he says! 
We have Singer plus one. 
Center, Singer plus one. 
What's he doing? 
Disabling or calming the locator. 
Yes? 
Chase, it's Michelle. 
We have Kyle Singer. 
I can't hear you. 
We found Kyle Singer. 
 We've got Kyle?! 
 Yes! 
Jack! 
Jack, we found Kyle Singer! 
Jack! 
Jack! Jack! 
Jack!! 
You can talk about facts or figures all night, Mr. President. 
Once again I see this as a question of judgment and integrity. 
Ignore this issue, an issue of rectitude and foresightedness... 
Congratulations. 
Now you are an even bigger enemy to your country than me. 
Wayne said you wanted to see me. 
Keeler. He�s bringing your ex- husband into this debate, 
the SEC�s investigation into his company. 
Well, Ted was convicted and served his sentence, you know that. 
All that Ted Packard wants is money! 
If we pay him off he�ll recant before this debate. 
It�s blackmail! 
We could have the money within the hour. 
Thought you were with my dad... 
Your dad�s side-lining me, Kim. 
Make him sit up! 
Look, I know my dad can be hard but he will come around. 
We shouldn�t have told him. 
Well, the only other option I can think of is for us to stop seeing each other. 
Chase, what do you want? 
I want to be able to do my job! 
Linda! 
I need your help! 
These guys, they will kill me if I don�t get them something. 
 Where are you? 
 I�m at the mall. 
CTU knows the powder�s not real. 
Now they�re going after Singer. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Grab him and take him to containment. 
Done! 
We believe your son was infected with a virus in Mexico earlier this morning before he came home. 
We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious. 
We got it, Jack! 
He�s at Los Feliz mall between Vermont and Sunset. 
I can land a team there in ten minutes. 
OK, fine. 
 Kyle? 
 Who are you? 
My name is Tony Almeida. 
I�m a federal agent but I�m here to help you. 
 I don�t believe you. 
 Come with me, I�ll prove it to you. 
We have an officer down! 
Kyle Singer�s not in custody! 
I repeat: Kyle singer�s not in custody! 
The following takes place between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm. 
Doctor! 
Get out of the way, please! 
Jack isn't picking up. 
Aren't any other agents there? Isn't Tony there? 
I can't get through to him either. 
I'm trying Michael right now. 
What's going on? 
 There's been gunshots at the mall. 
 When? 
About two minutes ago. 
I can't get in touch with my dad, or Tony. 
 Michael said someone's down. 
 Who? 
It's either Tony or Jack, he's not sure. 
He's about to find out. 
Hold on. 
It's Jack. 
He wants to talk to you. 
 Jack, what's going on? Where's Tony? 
 He's been shot. 
 How bad? 
 He was hit in the neck. 
He's still alive. 
They're getting him into hospital now. 
Oh God! 
Michelle, I know how difficult this must be for you right now. 
But you need to make a decision. 
What? 
With Tony down you're in command. 
If you wanna be by his side at the hospital you're gonna have to hand CTU over to someone else. 
No- one will fault you for whatever you choose to do. 
But if you choose to stay, we need you to work at full capacity. 
 I understand. 
 Michelle, I'm sorry. 
 Is Tony all right? 
 They don't know yet he was shot in the neck. 
Michelle, we're starting to overload the network. 
When the virus threat came in, we had start stealing cycles from the main CPE. 
 Chloe, now is not a good time. 
 What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? 
Just deal with it, ok? 
 Michelle? 
 Offload the archive files and send them to Division. 
That should free up the network. 
Fine. That's all I needed to know! 
I have to get to the hospital. 
Michelle, I need you in the conference area. 
The second call from Hector Salazar's people just came in. 
 I am not in the position to deal with this right now. 
 Who else is there? 
You're the ranking agent on site. 
Kim, I want you to find out what hospital they took Tony to. 
The second anyone knows anything you have them patched through to me. 
Ok. 
Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Bad Night Stand, adjacent to the 101 Freeway. 
Provide him with a full spectrum band wave radio, adjusted to frequency XQ2137. 
Do not attempt aerial or ground surveillance. 
You have two hours from the receipt of this message to comply. 
If you violate any one of these conditions, we will release the virus. 
Does the encoding scheme match the first message? 
Yeah. 
Is there any way you can find out where it came from? 
I can scan the frequency, maybe we'll get lucky. 
Whoever sent this message is controling Kyle Singer's movements. 
We have two hours to find him before they release the virus. 
 Kyle? 
 Linda, where are you? 
I'm trying to find a place to park but they're putting out some kind of barricades, something's going on here. 
No, no, don't go to the garage. 
Meet me outside the East entrance, ok? 
On Vermont? 
Yeah, yeah, go there now. 
I'll be there in a sec. 
Over here! 
I found him! 
Move over! Come on! 
Get over! 
 What's going on? 
 I don't know. 
Where are we going? 
We just gotta get out of here. 
It's all contact frequency so if he shows up anywhere please let me know as soon as possible, ok? 
You got it. 
Excuse me. 
 What's up? 
 I just heard about Tony. 
 Yeah. 
 How's he doing? 
He's on his way to the hospital. 
 Why isn't Michelle with him? 
 She knows it's gonna set us back if she and Tony are both gone. 
 Tell Michell I'm heading over to Downey. 
 You going to see Salazar? 
Yeah. 
 My dad said questioning him was a waste of time. 
 No, sitting round in here is a waste of time. 
Don't you think you should clear it with Michelle first? 
We lost the kid who's infected with the virus. 
 If anyone knows where he's going it's Salazar. 
 At least run it by her before you go. 
 I'll call her from Downey. 
 Chase! 
Dessler. 
 I'm looking for Tony Almeida's wife. 
 Yes, this is Michelle. 
Michelle, this is Dr Landser at Good Samaritan hospital. 
How is he? 
I'm afraid the wound to your husban�s neck is gonna require some vascular repair. 
We're just about to go into surgery. 
Can...Can I talk to him? 
No, we've medicated him. 
In fact that's why I'm calling you. 
We need your verbal consent to operate. 
Yes, yes, yes...Of course. 
Whatever you have to do... 
 Great, thanks. 
 Are you sure he's gonna be ok? 
Well we can't say anything with a 100% certainty until we get in there. But he's gonna be in good hands. 
Please let me know the second you finish. 
I'll find you in the waiting room when we're out of surgery. 
Dr Landser, I will do my best to be there but... 
you may have to reach me through this number. 
Ok, we'll find you. 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 Sure. 
I just spoke with Anne's ex- husband. 
I'm meeting him in half an hour. 
Unless you're changing your mind... 
I've never given in to blackmail in my life. 
Yes, but considering everything that you're up against today... 
we decided that... 
I decided to pay! 
It's my choice. 
And David, you're making the right one. 
Give this guy some money, he crawls back under his rock and life will be a lot simpler for everyone. 
Including Anne. 
I hope so. 
Yes. 
I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir. 
Put him through. 
The president's on the line, Mr Bauer. 
Mr President? It's Jack Bauer. 
Hello, Jack. 
I was told that Hector Salazar has given your office final instructions on delivering his brother. 
Yes, sir. 
I've also been told that you might be able to pre- empt that demand. 
We've identified the person carrying the virus. 
He is a young man named Kyle Singer. 
 Then you know where he is? 
 No, sir. Unfortunately we lost him. 
Can you find him? 
Not in the time- frame that Hector Salazar has given us to release his brother. 
So, either I hand over Ramon Salazar or risk that his brother will release the virus. 
Mr President, I understand that this is an impossible choice. 
It's not a choice, Jack. Not really. 
This nation's policy of non negotiation with terrorists has been a proven deterrent. 
Capitulating to Salazar would effectively destroy that policy. 
Mr President, hundreds of thousands of innocent people may die within the week. 
More would die in the long run if I released Salazar. 
I would be declaring open season on the American people. 
 This is your final answer, sir? 
 I don't negotiate with terrorists, Jack. 
 I won't negotiate with terrorists! 
 I understand Mr President, thank you. 
Conference in CDC and Health Services. 
I want a full briefing on quarantine and evacuation procedures. 
Yes, Mr President. 
Can you just tell me where we're going? 
I don't know, ok? I've just gotta get out of town 
for a second, and figure this whole thing out. 
I thought you had to meet with those guys. 
That's why I brought you the money! 
Things have changed, all right? 
What are you into, Kyle? 
I mean, you ask me to steal this money from my father so those guys won't hurt you over losing their drugs... 
I don't think it was drugs! 
What do you mean? 
What is it about? 
I don't know. These cops, 
they came to my apartment today, and they were saying something about... 
using me to...to bring 
some weird disease into the country! 
A disease? 
Yeah. This cop, he was...he was saying 
it was inside of me. 
In your body? 
I know... 
It sounds ridiculous, right? 
Right? 
Man, this whole thing is so surreal, ain't it? 
Pull over. 
What? 
I said pull over! 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
Take the car, take the money! 
Whatever you're doing, I don't want any part of it! 
Hey look, linda! Linda, come on! Come on! 
Stay away from me, ok? If you've got 
some kind of disease, I don't want it! 
 You should have never done any of it! 
 DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT? 
Kyle, please! 
Fine, fine. Baby, you're right. 
You're right, I'll stay away, ok? 
The money's under the front seat. 
Ok, now, come on Linda, please! 
Kyle, I really don't want anything to happen to you, ok? 
I really don't but I can't do this! 
How stupid am I! 
I'm sorry. 
Go! Run! Run, Linda! Go! 
Sir, we have a monitoring plan for everyone inside the quarantine zone. 
 Define the quarantine zone. 
 Everyone within a two mile radius of ground zero, ground zero being the shopping center where Kyle Singer was last seen. 
Mr President, this is Dr Nicole Duncan at Health Services. 
Medical teams are in place and are ready to start screening and releasing people from quarantine over a 72 hour period. 
If we move quickly, we believe we can lower the prior casualty estimate. 
 Lower to what? 
 Between 60000 and 90000. 
This is Wayne Palmer. 
Yeah...Yeah... 
 All right, thank you, Miss Dessler, Dr Duncan... 
 Mr President. 
We're about to set into motion a chain of events that will create panick throughout the country, that will take some time to control. 
If anyone here sees an option that I'm overlooking, now's the time to offer it up. 
It's Jack Bauer. He needs to talk to you in private, 
and he said it's urgent. 
Could you all excuse me for a moment? 
In the meantime I want everyone to contact their key personnel, make sure they're ready to go. 
 What is it, Jack? 
 Mr President, is this line secure? 
Yes. What do you need to tell me, Jack? 
For what it's worth, sir, I agree with you supporting this country's policy to not negotiate with terrorists... 
Jack, you didn't call me to express your approval of my decision. 
 I have another option for you to consider. 
 Another option? 
Yes, one that, I believe, that will protect the integrity of this nation's policy and stop this outbreak from beginning. 
 And how would I do this? 
 By simply doing nothing, sir. 
 Nothing? 
 Yes, Mr President. 
 Hector Salazar will view that as non compliance with his demand. 
 Not if he gets his brother back. 
How? 
Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison and delivered to him. 
The public and, more importantly, other terrorist groups would view this as a prison break as opposed to a capitulation to their terrorist demands. 
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack! 
Who breaks Salazar out? 
 I will, sir. 
 By yourself? 
I know the prison and I have full access to the prisoner. 
Because of the nature of my involvement with the Salazars I can break him out and deliver him. 
I have a history of insubordination with CTU, they would believe that I've switched sides. 
 The cover story would stay clean. 
 This doesn't sound like a one man job. 
I think in order to protect you Mr President, this has to be. 
I don't know, Jack. 
There has to be some other way. 
No, no. Not in the time that we've got left. 
The Salazars are going to release the virus in the next two hours. 
Regardless of how successful you are at containing the initial outbreak, the resulting civil unrest will far outreach any quarantine zones you've established. 
The damage to this country, sir, would be catastrophic. 
Mr President? 
I need your "ok" on this. 
Even if you succeed, I won't be able to protect your legal status. 
You'll be a fugitive. 
I understand, Mr President. 
This will be my last assignment. 
I don't know what to say. 
If you don't say anything, Mr President, I will accept that as a "go" for this mission. 
Good luck, Mr President. 
I want the information from Dr Duncan's central records in my office. 
My eyes only. 
Wayne? 
 Where are you going? 
 Excuse me. 
Wait. 
I'm sorry, Anne but I... 
I have an appointment. 
And I am running late. 
An appointment? The debate starts in 30 minutes! 
Who are you meeting? 
I'm sorry again but that's confidential. 
It's government business. 
Does this have anything to do with my ex- husband? 
Like I said: it's government business. 
Surgery, nurses' station. 
Yes this is Tony Almeida's wife Michelle. 
I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery yet? 
Yes he has. 
I just wanted Dr Landser to know that he's allergic to penicillin. 
Yes, he's aware of it. 
The allergy card was in his wallet. 
Is there a way to know how he's doing in there? 
No but the doctor will contact you as soon as he's out of surgery. 
Ok, thank you. 
Yeah? 
Er, the site profiles are done. 
You could have sent these to my system. 
Yeah, I know. I wanted to come down here anyway. 
Why? 
Because of earlier. 
What is it Chloe? 
I just want you to know that I didn't know Tony had been shot in the neck, when I was insensitive earlier. And had I known 
I certainly would have been more careful about my choice of words, ok? 
It's fine Chloe. 
I do try to be aware of other people, you know that, don't you? 
I said it's fine. 
Ok. 
Gael? 
What? 
I think we should be careful about how we talk to Michelle today. She's really sensitive. 
About Tony being shot. 
In the neck. 
Of course. 
So I'm telling everybody. 
Make sure everyone in your department knows. 
I've got to take this call. 
Is this a personal cell? 
I thought those were prohibited because they can't be monitored? 
I'm using it for an emergency, I'm moving around a lot. 
They'll monitor it at the other end. 
I've really got to take this call. 
Hello? 
When did you make the second call? 
20 minutes ago. 
Are they letting Ramon go or no? 
They're still deciding. 
What are they waiting for? 
They have less than two hours! 
I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything. 
I'm sorry! 
It's not good to touch what's not yours! 
 Does your sister know you're here? 
 No. 
Did you know it was loaded? 
It is a nice gun, huh? 
Take it, Sergio, it's ok. 
You like the way it feels? Huh? 
You want to pull the trigger? 
Hear the noise it makes? 
That's the power of these things, Sergio. 
It feels like a gun! 
Can I? 
Sure. Sure. Come on! 
You see that vase down there? 
Ok, now I want you to aim. 
And squeeze the trigger. 
Very slowly. 
What are you doing? 
Get out of here! Go! Now! 
How many times do I have to tell you to leave him alone? He's just a boy! 
A boy who needs to become a man! 
You're not his father! 
What you gonna do, huh? 
You gonna shoot me? 
Come on! Pull the trigger! Right here, come on! 
Get in there! 
What are you gonna do to us? 
What...What is this? 
What are you gonna do to us? 
Come. 
We never really finished our conversation. 
I was just wondering what you had decided. 
Decided about what? 
The debate. What to do about my ex- husband. 
I ran into Wayne a few minutes ago. I know he's never liked me 
but this was different. He was avoiding me and... 
I had a feeling I wasn't able to shake. 
What kind of feeling? 
That you're paying Ted to keep quiet! 
Is that what you're doing, David? 
Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing for the right reason. 
How can you reward someone for threatening you with a lie? That's wrong. 
There are political realities I have to consider if I want to stay in office. 
I'll tell you something... 
If it makes you feel better... 
It doesn't make me feel better! 
It just happens to be the truth. 
Anne, I have been in this job for nearly four years. And I have learnt the 
hard way that there are no absolutes. Sometimes you have to make compromises... 
Politically, yes! But when it comes to morality... 
David, you have to draw the line. 
I have drawn the line. 
We're just standing on different sides! 
You're running scared. 
I am fighting to stay in office and serve the people that put me here. 
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust that the people will be able to tell the difference. 
It's not that easy! 
You've never been about what's easy. You've been about what's right. 
That's who you are. That's who the people elected to lead them. 
And for what it's worth, that's who I fell in love with. 
I was... 
I was trying to protect you. 
Protect me? 
This won't end with Keeler's allegation! 
You're gonna be in the media's cross hairs. 
I am used to public scrutiny. 
Not like this! This will be different. 
And much uglier than you can imagine. 
I can defend myself. 
David? 
Have you made contact with Packard? 
Just going to. 
Are you with him now? 
No, he's coming over now. Why? 
Walk away. 
What? 
You heard me. 
David, we've been through this. 
Now, you decided to bury this thing, remember? 
I've changed my mind. 
Anne talked to you, didn't she? 
Wayne! Walk away. 
You wanted to see me? 
I've spoken to Chloe, and Adam, and we'll cover for you if you want to go to the hospital to be with Tony. 
Cover for me? 
Well, we know... 
You've got a lot on your mind right now. 
I'm fine Gael! 
We just thought... 
Look, Michelle. I've been taking 30% of Chloe's load 
since the bio- threat came in. I can handle half of COM's load as well. 
We just need the right user password on district servers so we won't be slowed down by request authorization. 
It's Joe Tommisello's area, he put a 24 hour delay on user logs because of security problems we've been having. 
So what if I call Joe and get him to wait for us? 
I tried that, he's unreachable. 
Is there any other way to do this? 
More bodies. We need at least four more 
system radi- analysts to take on work we've been doing. 
I can make some calls, get the next shift in early. 
I've already tried that. By the time they got here it would be 
too late. Look, I appreciate this but it's not gonna happen. 
So let's get back to work. 
Michelle! 
Listen, I agree. We can't run this place by committy. 
Let me step in for you. Adam and Chloe can stay at their posts. 
What about yours? 
When I was at Langley, I filled out for my period chief a couple of times and we got through it. 
Was there a bio- threat? 
President in town all in one day? 
Thank you anyway, Gael. 
CTU, Bauer? 
Kim, it's your dad, what are you doing right now? 
I'm still trying to locate a point of origin on that phone call from Salazar's people. 
Ok, look, I'm gonna need you to do something for me first, it's not gonna take long. 
 What? 
 I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document. 
Look in your file form, under the heading "Federal Transit Authorization". 
What's this about? 
I need to move Ramon Salazar. 
Why are you gonna move him? 
Kim, this has been given priority clearance. 
No- one in CTU's supposed to know. That's why 
you're the only person I can trust to do this for me. 
So, please, help. 
Ok. It's asking for a clearance code. 
It's: *99. 
Now it wants a pass- word. 
Lincoln 65 FGA. 
Ok. It's cycling. It's gonna take a minute. 
Ok, good. 
Look, Kim, I know you tried to come up to my office earlier today to talk to me about something that was really important to you. 
And I know I wasn't very supportive and I just wanted to... 
You don't have to do this, dad. 
Sweetheart, I do. I need to tell you I'm sorry. 
I know that I'm awfully protective of you. 
I just watched so many things happen to you over the last few years... 
I don't want you to get hurt anymore. 
The fact is, I trust you, I trust your jugement. 
I need you to know that anything that you ever chose to do I would support you in. 
Ok? 
Thanks that means a lot to me. 
Good. I love you so much, Kim. 
I love you too, dad. 
Are you ok? 
Yeah, yeah I'm all right. 
Is the document up yet? 
Yeah. 
Ok, I need you to send it to warden Mitchell, over at Downey, now. 
Done. 
Ok, good. Let me speak to Chase. 
He's not here. 
What are you talking about? 
Where is he? 
Kim? Kim, where is Chase? 
He went to interrogate Salazar. 
Chase is at the prison, now? 
He left about 15 minutes ago. 
He's gonna be there soon. 
I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
Son of a bitch! 
Yeah. 
Chase, what are you doing? 
I'm gonna talk to Salazar! 
Get back to CTU now! 
And do what? Some filing 
and some dusting round the office? 
No, I want you to work with Michelle and find Kyle Singer! 
She's got a dozen IT people on that right now! 
Listen to me! 
No! Listen to me, Jack. 
I know you're angry about me and Kim, I get that! 
But I'm not gonna let you stop me from doing my job! 
YOUR JOB IS TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS! 
You're in no condition to give me orders! 
Chase, I'm warning you. Don't go against me! 
Jack, look. You know I respect you but 
you also know I've been covering for you. 
Since you've been back, I've been keeping the fact that you're a junkie from Kim and everybody else at CTU! 
I'm not doing it anymore. I'm done. 
Chase? 
Chase? Damn it! 
Get this guy processed and get him out of here. 
 Agent Edmunds. 
 Warden. I need to see Salazar. 
I've got a lot going on right now. 
Have division follow up for written authorization but you need to let me see Salazar now. 
Salazar's been buying two murders today. 
Nobody gets close to him without full paperwork. 
You don't understand what's happening today? 
Our Salazar has information that I need. 
What kind of information? 
It's classified! 
This is my facility. I need to know. 
We're dealing with major terrorist threat. 
Salazar's brother is behind it. 
Go ahead and confirm with division if you want to. 
But hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, here. 
Now, Jack and I have been coming here twice a week for the last three months. Salazar's 
prevented us from doing our job with his stalling and his lawyers and his due process. 
We don't have time for that... 
I need to go one on one with him, right now. 
He's in isolation cell in B block. Come on, I'll take you. 
 Surveillance cameras? 
 Yeah, 3. 
Get them turned off. 
It's against regulations. 
Won't be any marks, I promise. 
You get 30 minutes. 
This is warden Mitchell. I need you to go black on isolation B. 
For how long, sir? 
Until further notice. 
You're a tough guy, huh! 
You are not worried of what might happen if you lay a finger on me? 
Ok...If you're not worried, neither am I. 
Let me know when you start to worry. 
Where's Kyle Singer? 
I told you, I don't know! 
You're gonna tell me who does! 
Chase! 
Put him in his cell. 
What are you doing here, Jack? 
We're running out of options. 
We can't find Singer. Salazar's our only hope. 
You were right. 
He's tougher to break than I thought. 
Maybe two of us can... 
Yeah. 
Look, Jack, about what I said before... 
 Forget about it. 
 So we're ok? You and me? 
Yeah, we're ok. 
Tell me about the security cameras. 
They're disabled. 
Good. 
Get him out of his cell. 
Are you gonna kill me, now, Jack? 
I'd love to, but I can't. If you play this cool, Ramon, 
you're walking out of here with me now. 
You'll be with your brother in the next couple of hours. 
Now, grab his feet. 
Turn and face the wall. 
How are you gonna feel, Anne... 
if David loses this election because of you? 
I don't think that's very likely. 
Mmm. Then you really don't know what you're talking about, do you? 
Because this allegation may cost him this debate. 
And David needs this debate to win this election. 
It was blackmail. 
And David made the decision to pay. 
It wasn't up to you to change his mind! 
If he believed the decision was right, he wouldn't have changed his mind. 
The problem is, you can't stand the fact that your brother wants me in his life. 
Because you're a distraction to him. 
And you're a liability. 
Compared to whom? Sherry? 
I'm not gonna sit here and try and defend Sherry. 
She went off the rails. 
But at least she understood the game, and she understood David. She was with him 
for over 20 years. 
I have been with him long enough to know the kind of man he is. 
You don't know anything about him or what it takes to survive in the world he lives in. 
We disagree, Wayne. We always have. 
Anne, I will not stand by and watch you jeopardize everything that he's worked for. 
I won't do it. 
I don't scare easily. 
What's happening, Jack? After all you went through 
to put me in here, I can't believe you're letting me out! 
Shut up. 
I don't believe you sold out. It's not your nature. 
But then, why knock out the kid? Did your government cave, 
but can't admit it? Is that what happened? 
You don't look so good, Jack. That's a bitch! 
You wanna get out of here? You'll keep 
your mouth shut and do what I say. 
You understand me? 
We've been cleared to pass. 
The warden wants to see you first. 
He'll be here in a minute. 
Ok. 
Don't you move. 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack. 
What's the problem? 
The access codes of this transfer order. They don't correspond 
to the ones assigned by the bureau of prisons. 
Division superseded those access codes. 
CTU has a mandate to prefix. 
This is yesterday's prefix. 
Son of a bitch. 
Someone in my office must have screwed up. 
Look, we'll get you the proper prefix retroactively. 
Look, I know about the terrorist threat. 
Agent Edmunds told me. 
That's exactly why we need to move the prisoner now. 
It's classified priority one, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. 
But I can't afford to lose any time over some small technical detail. 
Come on, Kevin, help me out. 
Where's agent Edmunds? 
He's conducting a search of the prisoner's cell. 
Trying to find some additional information. 
He'll be right behind me, he can help you out with the paperwork. 
Right, pick up your badge and go to receiving. 
Thanks, we'll hurry out. 
Move. 
Turn on isolation 3, please. 
What the hell? 
Someone turned the camera, the angle's wrong. 
Get Binge to meet me in isolation. 
Door. 
Face the wall. 
Agent Bauer. Can I get my gun and a badge? 
Open it! 
Door! 
Kind of hot today! 
Yeah, I'm burning! 
Whatever Bauer told you, he's lying! 
Come on! 
Here you are, check your gun. 
Ok. 
Daniel I'm back on post. 
Move! 
Security 3, get a block of the whole ward. 
Open the cell blocks, now! 
I can't do it from here. 
Is it worth losing your life over? 
Do it now! 
Come on! Get the hell out! 
What if I can get us a copy of keeler's playbook? 
What exactly do you mean by "playbook"? 
His entire prep for tonight's debate. 
 Damn it, I told you to drop that. 
 Will you just listen to me? 
There is something you need to see. 
There's nothing i need to see. 
It's about anne. It's something that 
we didn't know about her. 
Something that could damage all of us. 
 Can I talk to you now? 
 Yeah, Of course. 
Kim, what's up? 
Chase and I have been going out for a while, and it's starting to get serious. 
I really care for him, dad. 
 So what do you think? 
 I don't know what I think. 
We want the release of ramon salazar. 
If you refuse to comply, the virus will be released. 
It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form. 
Maybe what you're looking for is a white powder. 
It would look like a bag of cocaine or heroin? 
Yeah, that may even be the strategy. 
Someone thinks they're selling a bag of coke. 
when, in fact, they're handling the virus. 
 Where did you get that money  It doesn't matter. 
Okay, we needed it. 
I got it. 
So this is how you're going to help you're family? 
By dealing drugs? 
I'm not dealing them. 
It's a stupid delivery. 
That kid's walking around with a bag of cocaine that's got the virus in it. 
He doesn't know it. 
I need to find him and stop him from putting it into circulation. 
You didn't shoot up, did you? 
Why? You think you can hide it? 
I'm not trying to hide it from you. 
I'm trying to quit. / Okay. 
People don't just quit, jack. 
I am not. 
going on record with this addiction. 
Do you understand me? 
You're the only person who knows about it, so it's going to stay that way. 
Give me an update. 
Kyle's still in his house. 
What about the package? 
It's with him. 
 And ramon? 
 Just waiting to come home. 
Good. 
The following takes place between 3:00 p.m and 4:00 p.m. 
Adam, have you downloaded everyone's folders for the meeting? 
Not yet. I'm still pulling up some of the 
medical details about the virus. 
Don't waste a lot of time on that. 
The only thing our people need to know is that it kills within 24 hours of exposure and we believe Kyle Singer is transporting it. 
I got all that. 
What about our approach to Singer? 
Jack's going to meet nicole duncan, head of health services, los angeles. 
They're going to take a haz-mat team over to Singer's apartment. 
He's waiting for her now.

Hi, Jack. 
How you doing? 
I'm okay, Nicole. 
How have you been? 
Until this afternoon, I was doing fine. 
You know, I, uh... 
I tried to reach you after I heard about Teri. 
Yeah, I know. 
After that, I kind of withdrew. 
But I appreciated the calls. Thanks. 
We should get going. 
I just finished running Macer's epidemiological model. 
Her estimates were off. 
Better or worse than we thought? 
Twice as bad. 
She had nine percent of the population infected within a week, but it's closer to 20%. 
And the infection-to-mortality rate is higher than her estimate. 
Almost 95% lethal. 
I've been hunting germs for 12 years and I've never seen anything like this. 
Great. 
Are you feeling okay? 
Yeah. Why? 
You're perspiring. 
I've been non-stop since noon. 
Look, we're going to be about eight minutes out. 
It would be great if we could go over the quarantine protocols before we get there. 
 No problem. 
 Good. 
If you refuse to comply, the virus will be released. 
I want the release of Ramon Salazar... 
Gael. 
Here, take a look at this. 
Closing in on the point of origin of this call. 
You see this code artifact here? 
 Yeah. 
 I found a few more on this recording. 
I think it's coming from a domestic switching node. 
You think the call was made from inside the U.S.? 
Maybe. I'm piping it 
over to your system. 
See if you can find a match. 
 Okay. 
 But do it after the meeting. 
What meeting? 
Tony's shifting resources to help Jack in the field. 
He's closing in on the virus. 
 Gael. 
 Yeah? 
Jack needs that audio feed in place when he gets to Kyle Singer's apartment. 
I know, but Tony needs me to take care of something right now. 
 I'll get it to you after the meeting. 
 I need you to do it before the meeting. 
Jack's on his way there. 
So come do it now. 
I can't! Stop bugging me. 
I'll get it to you. 
Fine. 
Have you thought about how it will be when Ramon comes back? 
How it will be? 
Like it was before. 
Things have changed, Hector. 
Nothing's changed. 
He's only been gone three months. 
You've changed. 
You've been in charge while he's been in prison. 
Are you willing to give that up so easily? 
What is it? 
Bauer's telling CTU he's about to intercept the package. 
 How? 
 I'm not sure. I'm about to find out. 
 Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer? 
 Of course. 
Then we're fine. 
Hey, how was the interview? 
Fine. 
What's up, dad? 
Your mother told me you paid the rent. 
All three months we owed. 
Yeah. I came into a little money. 
How does a 19-year-old kid who doesn't have a job come into a little money? 
Tim and I, we went down to the track the other day. 
He knows this guy over at the stables, so, uh,  we got a tip. 
 Where did you get the money? 
Dad, what does it matter? 
Honestly, the rent's paid for three months. All right? 
The pressure's off us now. 
Did you do something illegal? 
No. 
I told you we went to Santa Anita, and we got lucky. 
I didn't do anything illegal. 
Don't lie to me. 
I've got enough to worry about. 
Now, this is my house. 
I pay the rent! 
I take care of you and your mother. 
And when you get that job, you go ahead and pay me back, huh? 
Wait a second. 
We're not done here! 
No, we're done here. 
Don't walk away from me! 
You should be thanking me instead of crawling up my ass. 
Kyle! 
Kyle! 
Open the door! 
Open the door! 
His name's Kyle Singer. 
We think he's transporting the virus, although it's likely he doesn't realize what he's carrying. 
How could he not know? 
Health Services believes that the virus was made to look like heroin or cocaine. 
We know that Kyle Singer was hired to deliver a package from Mexico to a dealer in LA. 
He thinks he's smuggling drugs. 
That's the working theory. 
Now, here's the thing. 
Once Singer delivers that bag of powder, it gets cut up and distributed throughout the city. 
At that point, it becomes impossible to contain. 
Was LAPD grabbing Singer? 
No. 
Why not? 
Can't they get there faster? 
LAPD is not trained to handle haz-zone. 
Jack Bauer's going to go in with a team from Health Services. 
We're going to run the operation from here, updating the president in real time. 
Now, we have to approach Singer with care. 
He has no idea how deadly this powder is. 
I'm not fighting. 
I'm just asking the questions. 
 He should respect us. 
 Of course he does... 
now will you please calm down? 
$1,800 is... 
He said he won the money at the track? 
He could come up with a better lie than that. 
Well, maybe he's telling the truth. 
Oh, come on, Helen. 
 Where you going? 
 Wherever. 
What's in the bag? 
 Some clothes. 
 Well, open it. 
What? 
Open the bag. 
I'm warning you: Open that bag or I'm going to open it myself. 
Mom? 
 Kyle, listen to your father. 
 It's none of his business. 
As long as you're living in my house, it is! 
Your house? 
This isn't your house. 
You can't even pay the rent. 
Oh, Kyle... 
Come on, will you quit snooping, please? 
Don't even think about it. 
What is this? Huh? 
Coke? Heroin? 
 Give it back, dad. 
 What did you say? 
 I need it. 
 What do you mean, you "need" it? 
What are you, some kind of junkie? 
No. 
I'm just delivering it to this guy, okay? 
And if I don't get it to him... 
Who? 
 It's just a guy, okay? 
 Who?! 
Give me a name. 
Kyle, answer your father. 
You just give it to me, okay?! 
Stop it! 
Hey, stop it, both of you! 
Both of you! 
Both of you! 
Stop! Sam! 
Sam, don't, Sam! 
Kyle! 
I can't reiterate this enough. 
This is a credible threat. 
Salazar's people will release this virus if we don't find it first. 
So lets get going. 
Okay, we're going to need a white room with full audio and video capability. 
Get me 3b if that's available. 
Log him in. 
I'll be there in a minute. 
I thought you were supposed to be with my dad. 
I was. He sent me back here. 
Why? 
To question Parker. 
Parker? He already turned in Kyle Singer. 
What else are you going to get from him? 
Nothing. 
And that's the point. 
 I don't understand. 
 Your dad's sidelining me, Kim. 
He's making me sit out. 
Why? 
Why do you think? 
Because of us? 
 Chase, I'm sorry... 
 He says he's protecting me... 
but I'm not the one he's trying to protect here. 
You're not blaming me, are you? 
Look, all I'm saying is, we shouldn't have told him. 
What were we supposed to do? 
Keep sneaking around until someone catches us? 
We could have waited. 
Until when? 
He'd have the Same response no matter when we told him. 
I got to deal with this kid Parker. 
Jeffery. 
The food's exceptionally bad today. 
Aren't there laws in this country for cruel and unusual punishment? 
Tell Annicon, I'm ready to talk. 
Bauer couldn't tell me, but Salazar's got some kind of leverage. 
Enough to get him released. 
I'm not about to let this son of a bitch erase the last two years of my life. 
Call your friend at the state department, see what he can tell you. 
Annicon. 
 Mr. Annicon? 
 Yeah. 
This is Jeff Benson, Salazar's guard. 
I know who you are. 
Sir, Salazar asked to see you. 
Why? 
He says he's ready to talk. 
I'll be right there. 
University of Southern California Don't ask me why, just do it. 
I hope you can get a refund. 
A refund? 
From whoever sold you that load of crap. 
David, Keeler is going to use this against you in this debate. 
Now, ignoring it's not going to make it go away. 
Neither will dignifying it with a response. 
He's going to claim that Anne perjured herself, which, in case you've forgotten,  is a felony. 
 Anne is no felon. 
The allegation itself is enough to damage you. 
Now, come on, David please, think. 
You know you can't go into this debate without some kind of response. 
What do you propose? 
Talk to Anne, make sure she's told you everything. 
She has told me everything. 
Are you sure? 
Ever since I started seeing Anne, you've taken every chance to undermine our relationship. 
 Just because you don't like her... 
 You're absolutely right, I don't like her. 
This isn't about me and Anne. 
It's about you and Anne. 
Now, if she's got nothing to hide, fine, David, she's got nothing to hide. 
But you'd better find out before you face off with Keeler on national television. 
Did you ask your friend Jack Bauer what's going on? 
You did, didn't you? 
But he wouldn't say. 
Must be very frustrating, Luis, being kept in the dark. 
You have something to tell me? 
 I asked you here, didn't I? 
 Then start talking, because you used up my patience an hour ago. 
you are dog with a bone, Luis. 
Once you bite down, you don't let go. 
When I'm out of here, I don't want you on me anymore. 
When you're out of here? 
You were right. 
In a few hours, I'm going home. 
Really? 
And how will you manage that? 
Hector's a good brother. 
Unless he's got a key to this place,  you're not going anywhere. 
 But he does have a key. 
And when he turns it, the last two years of your life, all the hours you've spent away from your family, all the work you've done to put me in here will go away... 
...just like that. 
I wanted you to hear it from me, Luis. 
I wanted it to be the last thing you ever heard. 
Your son will be returned to you now. 
I'm just saying that Kyle is in over his head. 
We're not calling a lawyer. 
 He hasn't even been arrested. 
 Not yet. 
Maybe he won't be. 
If we leave it alone, don't do anything, maybe this whole thing will just go away. 
 You can't be serious. 
 Why not, Sam? 
Why do we have to let anybody know? 
 Because it's against the law not to. 
 What are you suggesting we do, call the police? 
Maybe they'll give us a reward and then we can pay our rent. 
All right, that wasn't fair. 
I'm sorry. 
Oh, my god! 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 I'm going to get rid of it! 
 You want to visit your son in jail?! 
 Wait a minute. 
Helen! 
 Get back! Get back! 
 Who are you people? 
Where's Kyle Singer?! 
 Kyle Singer! 
 He's not here. 
Isolate him and draw blood for a full panel. Get an oral swab. 
Seal off all these windows and vents. 
No! 
in here! In here! 
 No! 
 Put her in quarantine. 
Tony, the virus is out. 
I repeat, the virus is out. 
Copy that, Jack. 
Where is it? 
In the sewage system. 
Get DWP to shut down the lines from ground zero. 
It might also be airborne. 
Get the fire department and LAPD to set up a perimeter. 
Tell them we've got a level-three hot zone. 
Copy that. 
Come in. 
Wayne said you wanted to see me. 
What's wrong? 
Keeler. 
He's bringing your ex-husband into this debate. 
The SEC's investigation into his company. 
Well, Ted was convicted, and served his sentence. 
You know that. 
I know what you told me. 
I told you everything there is to know. 
Ted's company was introducing a hypertension drug... 
 and you reviewed the research. 
 Yes. 
Which later turned out to have been fabricated. 
Which Ted knew at the time, and I didn't. 
Now Ted's claiming that you both knew. 
He can't reverse himself 8 years after giving sworn testimony. 
Well, he is. 
And he's willing to go on record with the press. 
I don't know what to say, except he's a liar. 
It's your word against his. 
David... 
you have reason to be suspicious. 
God knows, you've been betrayed by some of the people you've trusted most, but I'm not sherry. 
I told you the whole truth once. 
I'm not going to defend it. 
Because if there's anything less than complete trust between us... 
I do trust you, Anne. 
You should. 
Yes. 
We need to talk, David. 
I'm with Anne now. 
Ah, let me guess�� She denied everything. 
I believe her. 
Yeah, well, listen, I might be able to make this whole thing go away. 
How? 
Meet you in the auditorium... 
alone. 
All right. 
So have you had a chance to take a look at Nicole's field report yet? 
Yeah. I'm almost done. 
What are your impressions? 
Based on what I've read so far, I'm optimistic. 
So you think we'll be able to contain the virus? 
At the very least, we should be able to limit the casualties. 
Even though the virus was airborne? 
Well, there is some risk of it spreading, but Nicole's team acted fast. 
They evacuated and sealed off the apartment building and quarantined the Singers. 
 When do we get the test results? 
 Five minutes, ten tops. 
So looks like we lucked out, huh? 
 Yeah, we deserve a little luck. 
 All right, look, I got to go. Make sure you keep me 
in the loop, all right? 
 Okay, you do the Same. 
 Okay. 
Tony, LAPD's setting up the perimeter, but they need wind vectors for the last 15 minutes. 
Call meteorology. 
Extension 212. 
Tony, local news picked up the story about the dead body being dumped at Health Services. 
Great. 
They want a statement. 
What do you want me to tell them? 
Nothing. 
Tony, warden Mitchell is on the phone. 
He's calling from the prison. 
He says it's urgent. 
Almeida. 
Mr. and Mrs. Singer? 
What the hell is going on here? 
Because this is not about drugs. 
We think you've been exposed to a virus. 
 A virus? 
 It's called Cordillera Virus. 
We believe that your son carried it in from Mexico this morning without knowing. 
What do you mean "carried it in"? How? 
He thought he was carrying drugs. 
So, we've been exposed? 
I'm afraid so. 
Wh-what does that mean? 
Are we sick? 
We're going to have to keep you quarantined until we get the results back from your tests. 
Excuse me for one moment. 
 Yeah, this is Bauer. 
 Jack, it's Tony. 
Tony, I think Kyle Singer's been exposed. 
Yeah, we've already got an all points out on him. 
Have you set a perimeter? 
Yeah. We're doing everything 
we can to contain this thing. 
All agencies and departments are in the loop on a need-to-know basis. 
 Okay, good work. 
 Listen, Jack, I know this isn't a best time to tell you, but I just got some bad news. 
I figured you'd want to know about it. 
What's wrong? 
Luis Annicon was murdered. 
 Murdered, how? 
 Salazar's guard. 
We've got him in custody. 
He claims that ... 
Salazar had a son kidnapped and threatened to kill him if he didn't do it. 
Jack, I'm sorry. I know you 
two worked closely on this case. 
 Tony, I'm going to have to get back to you. 
 Is everything okay? 
 I'm going to get back to you. 
 Jack? 
 These results can't be right. 
 They are. 
 Check it again. 
 I have. 
Blood and saliva, atmospheric and surface tests, they're all negative. 
We can't find even a�� a trace amount of this virus. 
What the hell are you doing? 
You haven't showered down yet. 
We're not at risk. 
What are you talking about? 
 I watched the powder get out. 
 It's harmless, Jack. 
Some form of silicate, but that's all. 
 What? 
 There is no virus in the powder. 
We tested five Samples. 
There weren't even trace amounts. 
Atmospheric and surface analysis also came up negative, and Kyle's parents tested negative, as well. 
You're sure about this? 
The only thing I'm not sure about is if we're on the right trail. 
No. No, the body that was dropped off 
at Health Services was linked to Kyle Singer. 
Why would Salazar's people pay him to bring across a bag of worthless powder? 
Fine, Jack, but where do we even start looking? 
I don't know. 
Wait a second. 
Macer said the only way to transport the virus was in crystalline form, right? 
Yeah, that's the only way it can survive outside a living body. 
What if it was never outside a living body? 
What do you mean? 
What if the virus was transported in a living host? 
What if Kyle Singer was infected earlier this morning in Mexico before he even left? 
But Salazar has no leverage if Singer was walking around, infecting people. 
That's the point. 
He wouldn't be contagious yet. 
The incubation period is 14 hours. 
Right. Think about it. 
We know for a fact that Kyle Singer was in Mexico 11 hours ago. 
Hector Salazar hasn't threatened to release the virus for another three hours. 
The math adds up. 
We need to find Kyle Singer. 
 Hello? 
 Linda. 
Kyle, I told you, I have nothing to say to you. 
No, listen to me, okay? 
I'm in trouble. 
Yeah, because you're dealing drugs. 
I need your help. 
What happened? 
My dad found the stuff. 
We got in a fight, I split, but he's still got it, okay? 
And I got to get this them, all right? 
These guys are hard core. 
I got to make it right. 
Make it right? How? 
I know, I was thinking, you know, maybe, maybe I could pay them enough, you know, just  to keep them off my back.  You want me to give you money? 
No, no, no, just borrow. 
How much? 
It's about 20 grand on the street. 
I don't have that kind of money, Kyle. 
Didn't you say your dad keeps some cash around the house? 
 Not that much. 
 Linda, listen to me! 
These guys... 
they will kill me if I don't give them something. 
Please... please, anything 
will help right now. 
Now you want me to get involved in this? 
Just... please let me borrow 
something, anything. 
I'll pay you back, I swear to god. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at the mall. 
 I'll get there as soon as I can. 
 Thank you. 
CTU knows the powder is not real. 
Now they're going after Singer. 
What do you want me to do? 
Stay with him, and as soon as he's alone,  Grab him and take him into containment. 
 Done. 
You can't let the cops get him. 
We need Singer to make this work. 
Of course there's no way we'll ever release Salazar. 
CTU is very close to containing the threat. 
Yes, that's right. 
All right, Stan. 
I'll make sure you're kept in the loop. 
What have we got, Wayne? 
I just talked to Anne's ex-husband. 
Now, listen, all Ted Packard wants is money. 
If we pay him off, he'll recant before this debate. 
That's blackmail. 
 That's business. 
 I don't think so. 
David, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than trying to defend against this allegation, which is going to hurt you. 
I've faced down worse lies. 
I think I've earned some credibility. 
You read the polls this morning? 
Because Keeler is closing the gap, and this race is much closer than it should be. 
And listen, I know it's distasteful there, but in cost-benefit terms, it's a no brainer. 
Anne won't think so. 
 Anne doesn't have to know. 
 I can't keep it from her. 
Well, that's your choice. 
But if this comes out, Anne is going to find herself on the front page of every single newspaper in this country, and David, she's not Sherry. She's not 
equipped to handle that kind of scrutiny, and you will not be able to protect her from it. 
Now, between this debate and the threat of this outbreak, you have enough on your plate to worry about. 
Don't be a martyr. 
Keep it simple. 
We could have the money within the hour. 
Do it. 
What's going on? 
They don't have their suits on. 
What does that mean? Are we okay? 
Yes. The powder was harmless. 
Oh, thank god... then you put us 
through all this for nothing. 
 You scared the hell out of us. 
 Mr. Singer, we still need to find your son. 
Is there anything that you can tell us that would help? 
Why? You just said 
the powder was harmless. 
We believe that your son was infected with the virus in Mexico earlier this morning before he came home. 
We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious. 
What are you saying, that our son could die? 
 Yes, that could happen. 
 Oh, god. 
I know how difficult this must be for you, and I'm sorry. 
But we need to find your son, we need to find him now. 
 Have you tried his cell phone? 
 Yes. The line's been disconnected. 
No, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
Wait. 
 He took my phone this morning. 
 What's the number? 
818-555-0103. 
Okay. 
I'm going to need one of you to call him. 
This is my fault. 
I never would have done any of this if I couldn't take care of my own family. 
 No. 
 Yes. You know, it's true. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
Yeah, Jack, I just spoke to LAPD. 
They've got a priority APB on Singer. 
Okay, good. 
I think we've got a number on him. 
All right, look, we'll thread the line through a tracing matrix. 
Okay. The number is 818-555-0103. 
I want you to route the call back to my cell phone. 
You got it. 
I want you to trace that number and reroute the call to Jack's cell phone. 
I'm going to need one of you to make the call now, I need you to keep him on the line as long as possible so we can trace him. 
What am I supposed to tell him? 
The truth. 
Tony, you set? 
Yeah, we're ready. 
 Linda. 
 Kyle, it's your father. 
Dad? 
We need to talk. 
Look, I don't know what you want to talk about. 
I already know how pissed off you are, okay? 
Look, um, whatever you did... 
I know you were just trying to help out your mom and me. 
Yeah, well, look, unless you're willing to give back the stuff you took, I got to deal with the situation, okay? 
Kyle! Please, don't hang up. 
Please! Listen. 
Listen to me. 
What I'm telling you is important. Please, 
you have to come home. 
Dad, why do you sound different? 
I need you to trust me onsomething I'm about to tell you. 
Dad? 
You may have gotten a virus, something you picked up in Mexico. 
How'd you know I went to Mexico? 
It doesn't matter. 
But you may be sick. 
And if you are, then you need to get checked out by a doctor. 
Dad, I don't know what you're talking about, all right? 
 But I feel fine. 
 I know it sounds crazy, but it's real. 
Now, there's e some people here who are trying to help. 
 Cops? 
 No Tony, have you got a lock on this trace? 
 We're going to lose this kid. 
 How much longer? 
I've got the cell tower, but it's covering a three-mile radius. 
I can't believe this. 
This fight, one minute you tell me that you love me, the next minute, you're selling me out to some cops. 
They're not police, Kyle. 
They're just trying to stop this virus before it becomes an outbreak. 
Dad, I already told youI feel fine, all right? 
They're saying that you're not going to start feeling sick for another few hours. 
 But by then, it's going to be too late. 
 Tony, have you got a lock yet? 
How much longer? 
10 seconds. 
What do you want me to do? 
You want me to turn myself in? 
Because you may be sick. 
And if you are, other people are going to get infected. 
 Tony... 
 We got it, Jack. 
He's at the Los Feliz Mall, between Vermont and Sunset. 
Okay, get his photograph over to mall security. 
Tell them not to approach him. 
Look, Jack, you're 20 minutes away by car, I can land a team there in ten minutes. 
Fine. 
Tony, I don't want you taking Chase. 
 Why not? 
 I just don't. 
Thank you very much. 
We'll notify you as soon as we have him in custody. 
Please, help our son. 
We will. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, I'm not sure you've heard yet, But Tony's heading off site for a while. 
He is? 
Yeah. I'm taking over for a few hours. 
 Okay. 
 Let people in your area know. 
 Okay, I will. 
 Thanks. 
What was that? 
Michelle. She's taking over CTU 
for a couple of hours. 
Where's Tony? 
They have a location on Singer. 
Jack can't get there in time, so Tony's going. 
What? Tony's not field ops. 
Seems like they're really going out of their way to cut you out of the loop. 
Did you do something to piss off Jack? 
Bad idea, Chase. You're just 
going to make things worse. 
Tony... 
I just heard they found Kyle Singer. 
Is this for real? 
We'll see. I'm meeting Jack 
over there right now. 
Look, I'm done with this kid Parker. 
He's said all he's gonna say. 
 I want back on the case. 
 Yeah, well, we're handling it now, Chase, all right? 
Because Jack doesn't want me there, right? 
Did he tell you why he's cutting me out? 
I don't really care. 
He's your boss, it's his call. 
This isn't right. 
Did he tell you this is because of Kim? 
He found out we were seeing each other, and this is how he's going to make me pay for it. 
Take it up with Jack. 
Just want to keep the line open for Tony. 
Leave a message for Jack Bauer. 
Damn it, Jack. 
Chase. 
Chase. 
Look, I know my dad can be hard, but he will come around. 
How do you know? 
Because I know my father. 
Maybe you don't know him as well as you think. 
What is that supposed to mean? 
Nothing. 
It's okay. Forget it, Kim. 
Don't you think I feel bad enough already? 
Because I do. 
We shouldn't have told him. 
Well, the only other option I can think of is for us to stop seeing each other, which as far as I'm concerned, is not an option. 
Or is it? 
 Chase, what do you want? 
 I want to be able to do my job. 
Kim, we need you at your station. 
Tony's about to land. 
Tony Almeida, CTU. 
I think we found the guy you're looking for. 
He's in the rotunda. 
 Bronson, lock down the east exit. 
 Yes, sir. 
Pierson, I want you to run point from the security office. 
Alright. 
How long have you been using, Jack? 
What? 
I did a rotation in rehab. You learn to 
pick out when someone's using. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You know exactly what I'm talking about. 
How long? 
For a while now. 
It was the only way I could maintain my cover with the Salazars. 
 Are you high now? 
 No. 
 It's empty, Jack. 
 Nicole, I told you I'm fine. 
 I'm not so sure. 
 If you're not so sure, then turn me in. 
I don't want to turn you in, Jack. 
I'm worried about you. 
You don't have to be. 
I've kicked it. 
I have a responsibility to stop this virus, and I am taking a calculated risk that you are more of an asset than a liability.

Okay, where are you?

Where are you? 
We're coming into the loading dock, north entrance. 
 Have you got a visual? 
 Yeah, I got him. 
 Where have you placed your men? 
 We posted at all the main entrances. 
Okay, good. 
We should be there in a minute. 
All right. 
Have your men cover all the parking level exits. 
Let's go! 
I don't want to cause any kind of commotion. 
 Yeah? 
 CTU's here. 
They're about to move in on the kid. 
Just stand down. 
It's too hot. 
This is my only chance. 
We can't let the kid get caught. 
 No, no, wait. 
 I can't wait. Gomez! 
Wait here, I want to make a clean grab. 
Yes, sir. 
Kyle.

I'm a federal agent, but I'm here to help you. 
What your father told you about your being sick is true. 
I don't believe you. 
You come with me, I'll prove it to you. 
Get out of the way! Move! 
Nicole, he's been hit in the neck! 
Jamie, give me your walkie-talkie. 
We have an officer down. 
Kyle Singer is not in custody. 
I repeat, Kyle Singer is not in custody. 
Maintain cover on all exits.

What��s the man doing in our tent Who��s that? 
I don't know. 
Wait a minute. Is she a�� 
no,she's not a ghost. She's real. 
She's a young girl. 
But doesn't she look kind of yeah. Something's not right. 
There's not another campsite for miles. 
Oh,we scared her. 
No,wait! 
Wait a minute! 
Wait! 
We don't want to hurt you! 
We just want to help! 
Wait! 
Don't It's all right. Take it easy,ok? 
Let me see your leg. I'm a paramedic. 
I can help you. 
Let me just look at your leg,all right? 
It's nothing. 
It just needs to be cleaned and dressed. 
Hey,uh,tell us your name. 
You must be pretty scared,huh? 
Are you in these woods all alone? 
Tell you what. I'll make you a deal. 
You come back with us to our camp,ok? 
Get warm,have a good meal. 
I'll split this with you. 
Ok. You can have the whole thing. 
It's ok. 
It wasn't very deep at all. 
It should heal quickly. 
You know,we really want to help you, but you have to tell us a few things first,like... 
what's your name? 
Where are your parents? 
Are you lost? 
Maybe if we talk to child services back in town, they could give us some information becca. 
 Your name's becca? 
 yeah Ok. 
Becca,so... 
what are you doing here? 
Are you hiding from something? 
I ran away. 
What did you run away from? 
Your parents? 
I don't have any parents. 
They're dead. 
Do you live in a foster home? 
How long have you been out here? 
2 or 3 weeks. 
We need to find out where that foster home was so that we can let them know you're all right. 
No. 
Please. I don't want to go back there. 
Well,we're going to do the best we can to keep you safe, but we need to let the police know that we found you. 
Don't make me go back there. 
I'm begging you. 
You know,we don't get any cell service out here, and if we try to hike to the car,it would be dark before we get there,so... 
ok. 
You're going to stay here with us. 
We'll keep you safe. 
I won't let you leave me. 
What's going on? 
What's happening to me? 
hey, look at me, There's nothing here. 
You're all right. 
She's mine. 
proudly presents Ghost Whisperer Season 03 Episode 09 Becca,I know that you don't really feel safe, but trust me,you are. 
I think the best thing for you is just to get a good night's sleep. 
I can'T. 
Well,then,let's talk. 
Do I have to? 
I know that this is going to sound strange... 
but have you lost any friends or family lately? 
Why? 
I'm just trying to understand why you're out here. 
They hurt me. I left. 
I'm not going back. 
Ok. 
Why these woods? 
How have you been living out here all this time by yourself? 
I'm tired. 
I'm going to go back to sleep. 
Wait. Um,can you hang with me for a 
minute,just till I fall back asleep? 
Of course I will. 
Hey,I didn't know you were so good with teenage hard cases. 
Well,it helps that I used to be one. 
You? Come on. 
Yeah. You remember that age. 
You're always mad at your parents 'cause they didn't understand who you were. 
Well,take all that,add ghosts,and stir. 
Do you think that's what happened to becca? 
Or maybe she was abused? 
I don't know. 
What did the ghost say about her? 
He just said "she's mine. " 
Well,maybe he could be a friend or a brother who was also abused. 
Could be. 
Well,I guess we'll find out when we know where she belongs. 
What if we're just taking her right back to the thing she's running from? 
Don't really have a choice. 
Honey. 
No. Wake up. 
Becca's gone. 
What? 
I left this in my backpack. 
She must have found it in the tent. 
Ok. So where could she have gone? 
I don't know. Wherever 
she went,she's staying, 'cause she took most of the food. 
Oh,no. 
What? 
My car keys. 
What? 
Becca Just watch out. She 
might get some traction. 
Becca! 
Becca,stop it! 
i'll try get this side You can't go. I need you! 
I won't let you go! 
Go away! 
Leave her alone! 
Get out of the car- right now. 
Get out of the car. 
You could have killed yourself. 
What were you thinking? 
You saw him,too. 
You can see ghosts. 
So,we'll go downtown later and see if we can get some things that fit better. 
So you're not going to call the police or whoever? 
Eventually,but if you need some more time,for now... 
do you need some help with that? 
I know how to use a brush. 
You know,when my grandma first told me that she could see ghosts, I should have said,"thank god. 
You know,there's finally someone else like me. " 
All I could say was,"what is wrong with my grandma?" 
It might be something you have to get used to. 
So,you said that you were hurt by people. 
Mostly with words? 
Yeah,mostly. 
Who? 
My foster parents. 
What happened to your real parents? 
They died in a car crash. 
How old were you when they died? 
I guess I was,like,5 or 6. 
How old were you when you started seeing ghosts? 
I don't remember ever not seeing them. 
What did you say to your parents after they died? 
After they died? 
I never saw them. 
Your parents didn't die,did they? 
And you don't have foster parents. 
You made it all up. 
Look,you can tell me the truth. 
If you do,I can help you. 
And if you don't,then you're going to go back home, and nothing's going to be they think I'm sick. 
They take me to the doctors and they try to make me take pills. 
Ok. So then,we'll make them understand. 
It won't work. 
Well,you can't live in the woods forever,and you don't have to. 
Know how to make the ghosts go away? 
I know something better. 
Yeah,mom. I'm fine. I promise. 
I don't know. Just,like,some 
cuts and stuff, but he's,like,an ambulance guy,and he says I'm fine. So... 
yeah,I know. 
I'm sorry. 
They'll be here tomorrow afternoon. 
They live in a small town outside st. Louis. 
Well,what happens now? 
Well,they just talked to the grandview police, who said nice things about us,thank goodness, so I guess she'll stay here until they get here. 
How did she get that far from home? 
'Cause she's a smart girl. 
She took a bus 5 or 6 days and then got off here in grandview. 
Ok. And how 
about this another person who sees ghosts chooses grandview. 
Why does that keep happening? 
I don't know,but I don't have time to think about it. 
Right,'cause you got a ghost to cross over. 
No. She does. 
I have 24 hours to teach that girl everything I know. 
has you benn in a touch since you left home? 
no******* But the thing to remember is that they're more scared and confused than you. 
They're stuck here,for some reason,and most of the time,they don't even know why. 
and after you've figured out why they've stayed earthbound, you can help them,take care of them. 
And they can cross over. 
Cross over? 
Yeah. Into the light. 
So,how do you know it's a better place? 
You ever been there? 
No,but I've felt it. 
There's peace there,and knowing that I gave them that,there's nothing better. 
Hey. You must be becca. 
I'm delia. 
It's ok,honey. I won't bite. 
I hear that you are a very special girl. 
Uh,you know what? There's some really 
cool vintage dresses over there. 
Why don't you take a look? 
Melinda,you know that I believe that you do amazing things. 
I have seen you change people's lives again and again. 
 But this  what? 
Do you really think the best way to help this girl Is to give her a crash course in being you? 
Delia,she's not just running away from her parents. 
She's running away from ghosts. 
Can't you teach her how not to be afraid? 
I can't stop her from seeing them, which means that I can't stop them from going to her with their problems. 
Have you ever tried walking around with a crowd of dead people following you? 
It's not fun. 
Didn't you say your mom had this gift,and she lived with it? 
Trust me,that is not a good argument. 
Melinda? 
Yeah. I'll be right there. 
Look,I had my grandmother,ok? 
Becca has no one but parents who don't understand. 
I have to teach her how to cross them over. 
I'm not going to let her turn out like gabriel�� overmedicated and institutionalized. 
Becca! 
Look,I'm sorry,ok? 
I know that this is hard. 
You don't have to apologize. 
I should be used to seeing them. 
You have to stop running away from them, else they're going to keep finding you. 
You think I don't know that? 
Look,that's why you have to face them,ok? 
You just have to find out what they need. 
It will make them stop. 
Ok. I'll try. 
Let's start with his name. 
Did he give you that? 
I think it's daniel. 
Has he said anything about how he died? 
Um,I think he was in some kind of accident. 
He said there were bodies around. 
Was there a fire? 'Cause he 
looked e'like hd been burned. 
Honestly,I try not to look. 
He talked about that,too. 
Ok. I see it a little bit,but 
for her to be your mini-me, her hair would have to be a lot different. 
This is my friend rick payne. 
He's a professor. 
He's also oh,my gosh! Those eyes! 
Look at those eyes with that "don't even try lying to me, 'cause I can literally see right through you" look! 
 A little strange? 
 Yes. 
The resemblance is uncanny. 
Ok. The ghost. 
He's a boy,about becca's age. His name is daniel. 
There was an accident in the woods. 
There were lots of bodies around,so I'm thinking... 
last year plane crash. 
Yeah,he probably wandered off, got separated from the rest of the passengers. 
Yeah. The woods are not 
far from the crash site. 
Well,that would explain the bodies. 
And the burns on his face. 
Ok. Well,I'll check the manifest. 
I'll see if his name turns up. 
What about the voices? 
What voices? 
In your basement. 
Didn't you hear them? 
No,not really. 
Wait a minute. You can hear 
voices that melinda can't? 
That would make her more powerful than you. 
No. That's just how it works. 
In the beginning,you get everything�� you get voices,ghost energy,all of it. 
And then,eventually,you learn to tune certain things out so you can function. 
Whatever she's hearing,it's probably coming from the tunnels. 
Do you still have that giant hole in the wall in your basement? 
What tunnels? 
Oh,you don't want to know about the tunnels. 
Well,why not? What's under there? 
What's under there? More 
like who's under there. 
More accurately,who isn't under there. 
The amount of trapped souls ok. You know what? 
Maybe she should focus on the ghost that's haunting her right now,don't you think? 
Yeah,ok-yes. 
I do. 
What's my job again? 
Check the plane manifest. 
Ok. 
You and I have a field trip to go on. 
come on,Let's go find daniel. 
Why? 
Because this is probably near where he died. 
It will help him remember what happened. 
But why look for him at all? 
I mean,he hasn't bugged me in hours. Maybe he's finished. 
No,he's not finished until he crosses over until we help him cross over. 
How many times did I tell you? 
I don't like being left behind! 
Becca,talk to him. 
Find out what he needs. 
Please,don't go. 
Ask him what's keeping him here. 
Why won't you just leave me alone? 
They left me here. 
They never said a word! 
Were they punishing me? 
What was I supposed to think? 
Who? Daniel,who left you here? 
Who is she,anyway? 
I don't like her. 
Becca,find out what's keeping him here. 
I don't care. 
I hate him! I want him to go away! 
i'm burning Hey,what do you see? 
Daniel,talk to me,all right? 
I want to help you. 
She wants to help you! 
She doesn't want to help me! 
Why should I help her? 
Well,then,stop hurting her,all right? 
Let her go. 
Hey. 
What happened? 
I was on fire! 
It was horrible. 
Look,I know how painful this is,ok? 
But look at me. 
I'm right here. We're ok. 
There's a reason that he told you all of that. Ok? 
He was trying to tell you what happened to him, and with that,you can cross him over. 
I don't care. 
Yes,you do. 
You want to help him and yourself. 
I don't care about daniel or any of them! 
You can't give up. 
Yes,I can! 
I'm done. 
I'm never going to do that again. 
Still not hungry? 
You know,your parents are going to be here tomorrow, so we don't really have much time. 
Has a ghost ever done anything like this to you? 
I've seen weird things before. 
No one's ever tried to hurt me. 
I know how awful this is. 
But the vision,it'S... 
sometimes the only way they can tell you that they need your help. 
But why should i help daniel when all he tries to do is scare me? 
Look... I know that this is not fair. 
Most kids don't have to think about death until they're much older. 
But you and me? 
Our lives are different. 
You want a reason why you should help daniel? 
One is because if you don't,he'll never leave you alone. 
But the real reason is because you can. 
Ok. 
But how? 
The vision. 
Tell me everything you saw. 
There were bodies on the ground. 
I'm right here. 
I was on fire. 
You mean daniel was. 
At first,his skin hurt really bad. 
Then,he couldn't feel anything. 
There was metal burning. 
And tires. 
And there were cars. 
They looked like tinfoil somebody punched really hard. 
One of them was on fire. 
I think that one was daniel'S. 
Can you see a license plate number? 
There were letters. M-I-Y... 
the number 8. 
Hey... 
becca. 
No. You did great. 
You know what? Let's get out of here. 
What do you think? 
Let's go... 
walk amongst the living for a little while. 
Can I just be alone? 
Sure. 
Hey,melinda? 
Were you ever scared? 
It's never been easy. 
But I had someone who... made me feel brave. 
I hope I can do that same thing for you. 
Hey. 
How'd the open house for the new listing go? 
Oh,people loved the cookies,but not bites on the house. 
I brought leftovers. 
Thanks for covering. 
Where's becca? 
She's at home resting. 
Jim's there. 
How's she doing? 
We made some progress. 
I think I know who the little boy in the woods is. 
He's looking for his parents. 
2 cars hit head-on,causing a pile-up. 
There were 5 fatalities,including a family�� becca had seen their license plate in a vision�� a mother,father,and a 13-year-old boy named daniel asher. 
That's terrible. 
Daniel died at the scene. 
And his parents died later at the hospital. 
You know,maybe they just saw the light and went right into it. 
And he's just been waiting there ever since? 
He thinks they're still alive? 
I'm not sure. 
But he needs to know that they've gone,and he should join them. 
With any luck,becca will be able to convince him of that. 
It would really help them both. 
You know what? I really have to go. 
Hey. 
You're back! 
That's so great. 
Um,you could come meet my parents. 
So,I was telling them all about how you helped me. 
Now,I admit that I was just pretending to see ghosts, just like you did when you were my age for attention. 
Melinda. I'm joan cahill,becca's mom. 
I don't even know what to say. 
Honestly,I don't,either. 
Honey,the cahills were able to get an earlier flight. 
Um,this is tony. 
Tony,this is my wife melinda. 
Thank you for saving our daughter our whole family,actually. 
Well,I don't know if I really helped. 
You did. 
Look,I don't know how you got through to her, but these things that she was imagining,we didn't know what to do. 
Frankly,I felt like we'd lost her long before she ran away. 
But... you're back now. Right,sweetheart? 
Things are going to be a-ok. 
Yeah. A-ok,again. 
Thanks for not busting me. 
So,what are you going to do now? 
Every time you see a ghost,just ignore it? 
Kind of already tried that. 
 Yeah,but it will be easier now. 
 How? 
'Cause I know it's not my fault. 
Before,I thought I had something bad in me. 
I was making them come to me and nobody else. 
They come to you because you can see them. 
And because they need your help. 
Look,this is who you really are. 
It's who we both are. 
No. 
I'm not brave enough. 
You comfortable,sweetie? 
You can't hear a word I'm saying,can you? 
I could sleep for about 100 years,you know? 
Should we try to get a later flight tomorrow? 
No. Let's get home. 
Thank god,we can throw these away now. 
What were we doing,making her take these? 
Joan,wait... 
she wasn't hallucinating. 
She never actually saw anything. 
I know. I hope it's 
over,but just in case... 
it's not just about becca. 
It's about that little boy in the woods waiting on parents that will never come back. 
Yeah,but becca knows about the light now. 
So maybe she's able to help him. 
And he knows about you. 
He can come to you. 
And what about the ghost that haunts her after that? 
And then,the one after that? 
Honey,no one could have helped her more than you did. 
Yeah. 
That's what kills me. 
No. Get away from them. 
I'd give anything just to be with my parents again. 
Oh! No,no. Why can't 
you just leave me alone? 
Because then I'd be alone,too. 
How'd you like it if I left you in the dark in those woods? 
I begged you to. 
But you didn't mean it. 
Why can't you just be my friend? 
Because you're dead! 
You'd be dead,too,if I didn't help you find food and water. 
I looked out for you. 
Every night,I was there,and you knew it. 
Ok. Fine. You watched over me. Thanks. 
Now,go,please. 
I'm still protecting you. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Someone knows about you and your friend. That lady. 
 He found me,and he'll find you,too. 
 Who? 
I'm not sure. 
He wanted me to come with him,but I wouldn'T. 
He said he knows where they're keeping my parents. 
I don't understand. 
Melinda knows things. 
You should go to her. 
No. She just wants to send me away 
so I'll never see my parents again. 
Becca... 
please. 
You have to help me. only you hear voices 
Why don't you let me finish that up,huh? 
Go on up. 
that's weird  Hey. 
 We are so sorry to bother you. 
Is becca here? 
Please tell us she's here. 
No,she's not. 
Oh,god. 
When was the last time you saw your daughter? 
Um,we were tired. We fell asleep. 
Probably 3 hours ago. 
We already called the police. 
I woke up freezing. 
It always seemed so cold right before I hear her scream. 
Becca gets night terrors. 
And this time,she didn't call out. She was just gone. 
becca say anything? Was 
she talking to anyone? 
I heard her whisper something. 
She went into the bathroom. 
She does that sometimes when she's trying to hide from us. 
Yeah,but does she say anything? 
I buried my head in the pillow. I couldn't listen. 
Ok. She was probably talking to daniel. 
And if she went with him,then she's trying to cross him. 
I'm sorry. Cross him? 
Just take them to the police,all right? 
 I'm going to go to the woods. 
 You got it. 
Excuse me. What the hell is going on? 
You know what? I'm really sorry 
to have to throw this at you, but your daughter's been trying to tell you for years. 
You've tried pills. 
You've tried doctors. 
The only thing you 2 never tried was believing her. 
Your daughter sees ghosts,ok? 
And I know that because I see them,too. 
Look,you both have to understand that my wife has lived her entire life having people tell her she's crazy. 
And maybe right now,you think she is,too. 
But I'll tell you,she's the only chance you have of getting your daughter back. 
You can hear it too,right? 
This is where melinda said the trapped souls are. 
It sounds like they're hurting. 
That's why we have to hurry. 
Hello? 
This is guardian-safe. 
There's been an alarm activation at your place of business. 
Would you like us to dispatch the police? 
The tunnels. 
Sorry,ma'am,I didn't hear you. 
Would you like us to dispatch the police? 
No,no,no. It's my husband. 
Sometimes he forgets how the alarm works. 
I'm so sorry. Thank you. 
What? What? 
 What? 
 Hey. 
In the square this afternoon,when you told becca about the tunnels, didn't you tell her that she could get to them through the basement? 
Oh,gee whiz. You know,I really 
thought there was going to be a "sorry I woke you up,professor" mixed in there. 
She's in trouble,ok? 
She ran away from her parents after they heard her talking to someone. 
Was it the ghost daniel? 
No,room service. 
Well,we know she heard us talking about the hole in the wall in your basement. 
But why would they go into the tunnels? 
Because you told her that there were spirits trapped there. 
Maybe she and daniel think it's the best way to get to his parents. 
And by the way,the store alarm just went off. 
 Oh,boy. Sounds like daniel's up to his old tricks again. 
 What? 
Remember,you asked me to read up on the accident? 
Well,the post mortem report says that that kid's blood alcohol level was a few notches above schnockered. 
So,he was drunk? 
Very. 
I think your parents are down there. 
Look,if you're scared,you don't have to do this. 
You can just go. 
I'll go alone. 
You could get hurt. 
I won't leave you. 
We can do this. 
Becca,you here? 
Becca? 
Becca? 
Daniel? 
Becca? 
Becca! 
Becca? 
Daniel? 
Becca? 
mom, dad? are you here? 
She's here,another one. 
mom? dad? 
Are those your parents? 
You. Is it over? 
Can I go now? 
Who are you? 
He has a gun. 
Why did you all come here? 
How did you find this place? 
It still hurts. 
We were promised. 
You said... 
he promised. 
Becca,I'm scared. 
Who are all these people? 
Melinda,see? 
Just a few stitches and you're all better. 
And we can stop somewhere special on the way home. 
oh, melinda It's ok,honey. 
They're just upset. 
Erwe we supposed to help. 
I can't understand them. 
There's too many voices. 
I know. 
But if you try,you can hear what's important, the one soul that we need to hear most at that moment. 
All we have to do is listen with our hearts. 
Where is he? 
I can't find him! 
Sweet girl,can you help me? 
I need to find my husband. 
Daniel? I'm here. 
i'm here. It's ok. 
No,it's not. 
We can't find my parents. 
I know. 
I did. 
I listened for them. 
Then,I heard them calling for you. 
 Daniel? honey 
 Daniel? Where is he? 
Daniel! 
I've been waiting for you for so long. 
It's ok. 
You can go to them. 
Daniel,what's wrong? 
Daniel. Come. 
You said they'd never leave you. 
But you didn't believe that,did you? 
Not after what happened that night before the accident. 
It's my fault. 
We never would have been in that car if I didn't screw up. 
My friend levi's parents were out of town. 
We all said we were sleeping at someone else's house. 
And we snuck into their liquor cabinet. 
We went outside and started taking out some mailboxes. 
Someone called the police. 
And then they called us. 
At 2 A.M.,We're picking our 
13-year-old up from the police station. 
Blaming ourselves,each other. 
Arguing over who was supposed to follow up with levi's parents, still thinking every mistake could be avoided. 
If I hadn't done that,if you weren't so tired and worried daniel! That car swerved into our lane. 
Dad! 
It wasn't your fault. 
And even if it was,we would never leave you. 
Then where were you? 
Your parents died at the hospital. 
We didn't understand what happened. 
How could we still be here and you not? 
And then,we met a man who... 
told us he could bring us to you. 
A man. Who are you talking about? 
He didn't say his name- only that we shouldn't go into the light. 
If we did,our son would be lost forever. 
We're together now. 
Do you see it? 
It's so beautiful. 
Daniel. 
Come. 
I can'T. 
I don't see it. 
He needs your help. 
But how? What's keeping him here? 
Just listen with your heart. Ok? 
You'll find the answer. 
He's staying behind because of me. 
I've already hurt my family so bad. 
I don't want to leave and hurt you. 
 Daniel,it's ok  it's not. 
We know that now. 
Look around this place. 
Who's going to watch over you in the dark? 
Daniel,if you do this... 
you'll be helping becca. You 
you'll prove to her that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Come on,daniel. Just try. 
See the light. 
For me. 
Look at that. 
Mom. 
Dad. 
I see it. 
Take care of her,will you? 
Yes. Yes,I will. 
We want to believe you. 
You have no idea how much. 
But it almost seems impossible. 
If you need help explaining anything... 
dad... 
there's someone... a man. 
He's been wanting me to tell you both something. 
He's been asking for a long time. 
I was scared of him at first because he looked... 
he said he died of an aneurysm. 
He said you're married because of him. 
She's talking about larry. 
He introduced us,but becca,he died before you were even born�� he wanted you guys to meet for so long. 
But you guys just kept on saying no. 
And he just kept saying�� Have a little faith. 
what if I don't know how they died, or what if I don't know what it is they're really missing? 
 What if it just  hey,relax. Ok? 
I just saw you do it. 
I didn't tell you what it was that daniel needed. 
You just listened with your heart. 
Yeah. 
Can I ask you something? 
When you were running away,why did you stop here,in grandview? 
I don't know,just a feeling. 
The bus stopped,and something told me to get off. 
 It was just  something you had to do. 
Yeah. 
well,you know where to find me. 
I wasn't sure if you were still in town. 
Something told me you were. 
Is it really worth it,gabriel? 
To break up families just for a few extra souls? 
I mean,what could you possibly need them for? 
It's not just about gaining or losing a few extra souls. 
Of course not,unless you happen to be one of them. 
As usual,you're missing the big picture. 
What is the big picture? 
'Cause you're just a collector. 
And please,don't stand there and pretend like you're doing something noble. 
Wait a minute. 
You didn't want them,did you? 
You wanted her. 
That's what drew her here,the same thing that drew you. 
Please,don't do this. 
You have a real choice. 
You could work with me,and we can free all of those souls down there sorry. I picked another horse. 
He's much faster than you. 
Then what are you doing here? 
You're my sister. 
And you have a choice too. 
What does that mean? 
It means don't be so sure you have all the answers. 
Tony, someone just dropped out a dead body infected with the virus. 
Based on the autopsy, at the end of the first week, 9% of the Los Angeles county would be infected. 
It's over a 1 million people. 
We want the release of Ramon Salazar. 
If you refuse to comply, the virus will be unleashed. 
Jack, you know Salazar better than anybody else here. 
Who do you think we're dealing with? 
Without a doubt his brother. 
Hector was next in command. He went underground the second Ram�n was taken into custody. 
Have you made the call to the FBI? 
Yes, I did. 
What about our boy? 
I'm watching him now. 
What are you into here man? 
You're selling dope? 
This guy he paid me $5000 to bring some coke over the border. 
I did that last night. 
Today, I drop it off, I get another $5000. 
When did FBI get this call? 
About 20 minutes ago. 
And we don't know who we're dealing with? 
It was a scrambled voice on an open line. 
Do we cancel the debate? 
They are discussing whether or not we should stay in Los Angeles. 
Chase, no day is a good day. 
We said it we will tell him if we're still together after two months. 
It's almost three. 
Why don't we just tell him and get it over with? 
Listen Jack. 
You were under of Salazar for 6 months. 
I know what they did to you. 
You look like hell. 
I'm concerned about you, Jack. 
The things you did to get me here, I wouldn't wish on anyone. 
The following takes place between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm. 
The president is not gonna make any decisions until he knows what we're dealing with so... 
give me all the parameters Tony. 
Well, basically, what we have here is a terrorist demand. 
Someone close to Ram�n Salazar, we're guessing his brother, Hector, is demanding his release. 
If we don't comply, he's threatening to initiate an operate of a very deadly fast acting virus. 
How do we know if these people are really in possession of it? 
Wayne, I've got Dr. Sunny Macer on the line. 
She is technical director of National Health Services. I let her address that. 
Mr Palmer, about an hour ago, a dead body was anonymously delivered to our office. 
It was infected with a type 3 immuno- virus deliberatery introduced into its system. 
This virus kills within 24 hours of exposure and there is no none antidote or vaccin. 
What's particurlaly disturbing is how fast it spreads. 
Take a look. 
As you can see, it's latent for several hours, but once the symptoms present, it consumes the host rapidly. 
Our office will be sending you preliminary projections of casualties in case something like this should be unleashed. 
And Wayne, I've gotta tell you, it's pretty bleak. 
I don't understand this. 
I mean, I thought we knew what biological threats were out there. 
And how do we find ourselves up against the wall so suddenly with something that isn't even on our radar? 
This is a strain we've never seen. 
The autopsy is confirming that someone is engineered this virus to kill 10 times faster than its ordinary genotypes. 
Ok. Ok, I see. 
Sir, I can't underscore enough how potentially devastating it would be if this virus were released by terrorists. 
By giving this information, what options would the President be looking at? 
It's the unweathering policy of the USA to stand firm against any terrorists demands. 
And I know the President, Tony, He will not free Salazar. 
No matter what the threat. 
All right then we can't waste any time on standard protocole today. 
We've been giving five hours to comply. 
If we're gonna find these people and stop this threat then CTU has to have any possible resources at its disposal. 
You'll have it. 
All right. Now if we've nothing else to discuss, 
I'd like to get my team back to work. 
 Understood. 
 Thank you. 
Bauer. 
Dad, it's me. 
What, Kim? 
Adam and I just found something on Goss. 
We're working it up now. 
We should have an address for you pretty soon. 
Ok, good work. 
And...Dad, remember, I want to talk to you. 
What? Something wrong? 
No. I was just wondering if I could come up for a few minutes. 
Something personal. 
Sweetheart, right now is not a good time. 
As soon as I've got a moment I'll come down, ok? 
Yeah, thanks. 
They're getting close to Goss. 
You didn't shoot up, did you? 
What? You think you'll hide it from me? 
I am not trying to hide it from you. 
I am trying to quit! 
Ok, people don't just quit Jack. 
I've been tempering off. 
OK, now it's time to stop. 
It doesn't look like it's time. 
All right, today is not a good day for you to be needing a fix. 
Why don't you go work with Chloe and see if you can pin down a location on Hector Salazar? 
What's wrong with the methadone program? 
Ok, it takes a little time but it works. 
I am not going on record with a citation, do you understand me? 
OK, so right now, you're the only person who knows about it. It's gonna stay that way. 
OK, this is nothing to be ashamed of. 
You did this in the line of duty. 
Doing junk whas the only to get close to Salazar Nobody is gonna knock you for that. 
I know what I did, Chase. 
This conversation is over. 
Just get back to work. 
Yeah. 
Chase? 
What? 
I was just looking at playback of the Health Services briefing. 
What about it? 
The government is not letting this happen, are they? 
I mean Salazar is just one person no matter how bad he is. 
Free it all that Chloe. We need to operate under orders 
that is to find the carrier of this virus. 
Find the carrier? In the next 4 hours? 
Come on Chase! That's not likely, is it? 
Not if we sit here and debate it. 
Who is just supposed to find and modify the list of Goss' associates? 
Kim is bringing it up now. 
Great. Then, go over the autopsy report. 
See if there's anything they overlooked. 
Fine. 
Here are the files on Goss. 
I heard you talking to your dad when I was in his office. 
Why do you want to tell him today? 
Because it's not a big deal. 
Well, it is a big deal, ok? 
Now not only do I work for him but I'm also a field agent. 
It's the last thing he wants for his daughter. 
How do you know that? 
I know. 
Ok? I mean, he talks about things. 
About how he was never there for you, or you mum... 
Ok? He doesn't believe that a field agent can have 
a relationship outside of work. 
Well, did you ever start to think that maybe it would make him happy? 
That his daughter has found someone she loves? 
Look, I love you too. Ok? 
I just don't think today is a good day. 
Chase, I need you to copy me on that list. 
Ok, what's this column? 
Hmm...That's family and that's legal. 
 Great. 
 Ok. 
Yeah, I understand but just watch to cross- reference those files with our Latin America files. 
Yes. I want all the names to printed out. 
Ok. Just give that over to my office. Thanks. 
 Hey, Dad! 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
You're all right? 
Yeah. Well, what's going on? 
Chase said you were really stressed out. 
Stressed, what do...what do... 
what do you mean'stressed'? 
You know... 
Salazar and the terrorists threat. 
Yeah. 
Yeah! Yeah but I think we gonna get it under control. We just got a lot of work to do. 
Listen, can I talk to you now? 
Yeah, yeah sure, come in. 
Take a seat. 
Hey, what's going on? 
After all we've been through, I find it very difficult to keep things from you... 
Ok, what's up? 
Chase and I have been going out for a while and it's starting to get serious. 
I mean...I think he wanted to be the one to tell you 
but he was worried that it would cause a problem between you two. 
I see... 
How long are the two of you been seeing each other? 
Three months. 
I really care for him dad. 
So what do you think? 
I don't know what I think. 
I'm really surprised. 
And, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit distracted with everything that's going on today but... 
I know but... 
Forget it. I just had to let you know. 
No, no, I'm glad you told me. 
Ok. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
I told him. 
What did he say? 
Nothing. 
 Dessler. 
 Michelle, it's Sunny. 
I think I found something that might be helpful to your guys. 
What's that? 
I told you I found something odd in Goss's system... 
We found an unmetabolised virus particule. 
I'll skip techno  babble. Bottom line: It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form. 
I mean, maybe what you're looking for is a white powder. 
So, it would look like a bag of cocaine or heroine? 
Yeah, that may be the strategy. 
Someone thinks that they're selling a bag of coke well in fact they're handling a virus. 
Look, Kyle, I'm not gonna do it, ok? 
I don't care how much you pay me, it's stealing drugs. 
Tim, you're my best friend. 
Come on, you've gotta come. Do it for me. 
Well, look Kyle, you should talked to me before you went down to Mexico and bought a bag of coke! 
I'm not...I'm not asking you to do anything but wait in the car. I'll make the delivery. 
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna go with you. 
Fine. 
Yeah. 
Kyle, it's Zack. 
Zack, hey! What's up? 
 We need to talk. 
 Hold on a second, man. 
Who's Zack? 
It's nobody. 
What's with you guys today? 
Everything is a secret. 
He's got family stuff going on. 
What's going on, man? 
You tell me! You've got the powder? 
Yeah, yeah, of course I do. 
Just tell me when to drop it off. 
Tonight. Come by around 7:30. 
7:30, yeah. 
Can we just go over one more time? 
I'd like...how this all thing is gonna go down? 
Go over what? 
You drop off the coke, I give you the money. 
Is that too much for you to handle? 
No! 
No, that's totally cool, man. 
It'd better be. 
Yeah. 
Jack, it's Michelle. 
We've got the last known address on David Goss, the infected body that was dropped off at Health Services. 
How recent? 
Two months. 
Okay. Have LAPD send over perimeter team. 
Tell them hands off until Chase and I get there. 
Got it. 
Chase, let's go around. 
You get an address? 
Yeah. 
Make sure they understand. 
They are not to go in until Jack gets there, ok? 
Hey! Peter just told me you've got 
an address on Goss? 
Yeah. I'm bringing it over to Jack now. 
You're sure there's nothing more recent? 
We could spend another hour looking, but there's no guarantee we find anything better. 
Yeah, we don't have one hour to waste, do we? 
Look, put transmitters on Jack and Chase. 
I wanna be analizing all their interactions so we can work it up in real time, all right? 
Ok. 
Jack. 
What have you got? 
This is everything we have on Goss. 
Here is the address where he was arrested for dealing. 
How recent? 
Two months ago. It's all on the file, 
you can check it on the way. 
Good. 
 Medical kit that health services has put together for you. 
 Thanks, baby. 
Be careful. 
Let's go, Chase! 
We've gonna have to wait until we get there to see what the set- up is. 
LAPD is locking it down now. 
And I know Kim told you about us. 
I was going to tell you myself, I just couldn't find the right time. 
I thought you should know. It's getting serious. 
That's what she said. 
What does the CTU have to say? 
That it could be a very dangerous situation. 
Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could happen if this virus is released and it's not good. 
Give CTU carte blanche. 
 Whatever they need, make sure they get it. 
 I did. 
We should cancel the debate. 
What? 
It's a mistake to continue preparing for tonight while there is an imminent bio- terrorist threat against this country. 
First of all, we don't know that is imminent, David. 
And you know just as well as I do that we get threats everyday. 
Not like this one. 
They said the body was infected with a weaponized virus. 
Ok, let's say you're right. 
What do really think you could do if you put your full attention on it? 
I just wanna make sure that you're not advising me how to fear that my image will suffer if we cancel. 
Oh no, it will suffer. 
But I still think the best thing to do is to procede as planned and respond when we have more information. 
Keeler's here. 
Come on, let's go this way. 
Don't worry, Wayne. 
John! 
Mr. President. You don't have to come away down here just to welcome me. 
No, it's no trouble. 
I spoke with your old friend Jacob Weisz yesterday at a fund raiser. 
You stopped at South Dakota? 
Just for dinner. 
How is he feeling? 
Better. Much better. 
He's even playing a few rounds of golf. 
That's him. 
Well, I don't wanna keep you John. 
I know you have a lot of last minute cramming to do if you wanna survive this debate. 
I woon't argue with you there, Mr. President. 
Your resource staff  compliments of the tax payers  outnumbers mine, three to one. 
I actually have to pay some of them myself! 
Touch�! 
I'll see you inside, sir. 
You certainly will, sir. 
Wayne, we're ready. 
What were you talking to him about? 
I think we may have a opportunity. 
What kind of opportunity? 
Not now, after. 
I'm sorry if you think I'm not good enough for your daughter. 
Ok? But I can't help the way I feel. 
Chase, what do you think I put Kim at CTU? 
Behind a desk, working on a computer? 
So I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's safe! 
Not so she can start dating some field agent! 
Safe? 
You know you're talking about her like she's 12 years old. She's a grown woman. 
Damn it Chase, you've seen what this job can do to you. 
You've seen what it's done to me. 
It ruined every relationship I ever had! 
 That's you, Jack... 
 No! 
No, it's the job! 
I don't think so. 
You don't think so... 
What the hell do you know? 
My wife died because of this job. 
And I almost lost Kim too. 
I'm not gonna let that happen again. 
I will do everything I have to to protect her. 
Do you understand me? Everything! 
Damn it Chase, you cannot have a normal life and do this job at the same time. 
So, you're saying that I shouldn't have any relationship with anyone? 
That's exactly what I'm saying. 
And especially with my daughter. 
Agent Bauer? 
Jack, it's Luis. 
What's up? 
You tell me. I've tried to move Salazar back 
to solitary but there is a lockdown from Division. 
What's that all about? 
I can't tell you right now. 
Jack, the bastard murdered his attorney right in front of us. 
What the hell is Division doing protecting him? 
They're not protecting him. 
Then what? 
I can't get into it right now. 
Can't get into it? 
You're not the only one who gave up a chunk of his life to put this guy away! 
I need to be in the loop Jack! 
This information doesn't go anywhere after you hang up the phone. 
What? 
Salazar might walk. 
Walk? 
What are you talking about? 
Look, I don't think it's gonna get to that. 
But someone on the outside has got a lot of leverage. 
Who? 
I think it's his brother, Hector. 
I don't believe this! 
 Just hang tight. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. 
 Yeah. All right. 
You'd better star thinking about what we're gonna do when we get there. We'll talk about this later. 
Fine. 
Open the door. 
Let's go. 
 Open 12. 
 Copy that. 
�Luis, me hace encontrado nuevo abogado ya? 
No, I haven't found your new lawyer. 
About an execution day? 
Uh! Someone's not happy? 
What do you know, Ram�n? 
About? 
 Talk to me. 
 Talk to you about what? 
What is your brother trying to do? 
Hector? Have you heard from him? 
How is he? 
His birthday's coming up next week. 
I don't even know what to get him. 
You keep talking trash, man. 
You're not going anywhere! 
Maybe not! 
But let me insure you of one thing: If something does happen and I am unexpectedly allowed to go free, I have no doubt that you'll come looking for me. 
Especially after the death of your wife, Elise. 
And your two boys, what are their names? 
Thomas and Luis Junior? 
 Any follow up phone calls from the terrorists? 
 No. 
So basically, there's nothing new to report to the President? 
Not until I hear from Bauer. He's following a lead right now. 
All right, Tony. Thanks. 
So, if you excuse me until this evening's debate? Thank you. 
That went well. 
Yes, it did. 
So, what's the latest? 
Nothing yet. CTU is working a lead. 
Trying to figure out who dropped off the dead body. 
So, they still don't know who's behind this threat? 
No, they're still speculating on Salazar's brother, Hector. 
What they don't is if it's a bluff staged to release Salazar. 
And how can it be a bluff? 
The virus has been confirmed. 
Yes but dropping off a dead body is one thing, David. Being able to infect an entire city, 
that's something different. 
All right. I guess we'll know soon enough. 
Hey! Wayne. 
You spoke earlier about an opportunity. 
Yeah...Yeah but I'm not really sure that's 
something we need to discuss right now. 
Which means... 
whatever it is fell through or you know I'm not going to like it so you're proceding without me. 
No, that's not it. I just think that because of 
this threat, I don't wanna divert your attention. 
Like walk and chew gum at the same time. 
What is it? 
Keeler's playbook. 
What if I can get us a copy? 
What exactly do you mean by "playbook"? 
His entire prep for tonight's debate. 
How's he gonna answer the questions, what issues he's gonna try to review up on. Everything. 
And how would we get it? 
You don't need to know the details. 
I'm surprised. 
About what? 
The question. You know there's no way 
on Earth that I would ever agree to this. 
David I'm not...I am not talking about pulling a Sherry and stealing it. 
Now it may just drop in our laps. 
And if it does why shouldn't we look at it? 
Wayne, you are not in the private sector anymore. 
You have to get use to how my administration works. 
And I'm just trying to give your administration 4 more years. 
Ok...Ok, if that's how you want it. 
That's how I want it. 
Hey! Kim, you are all caught up? 
Pretty much. I just have to refresh 
the data of my dad's panel. 
Great. 
Can I ask you a question about you and Tony? 
Me and Tony what? 
I don't know, I was just wondering is it... 
a problem working with your husband in the same office? 
No, no, it's...not a problem. 
Why do you ask? 
It's not a big deal. 
No, it's ok, we have a minute. 
Well, I've been dating Chase and I don't think my dad's too happy about it. 
I see. Well... 
I'm sure your dad is just trying to protect you but... 
ultimately, it's just between you and Chase. 
Yeah, I know. 
Right, let me know when you finish those panels, ok? 
Sure. 
Analysits just called. 
They determined that if Hector Salazar is orchestrating this bio- threat, he's probably operating in the Northen Mexico. 
So, we're gonna need a list of his properties down there. 
Chloe's working on it, she's going through the brief files that Jack turned in after the bust. 
All right. I'll talk to her. 
Also... 
Fire up all our contacts and just in case Hector was stupid enough to show his face in the last couple days, all right? 
Ok. 
Is the boy still in place? 
Yeah. 
And the President has been informed? 
Yeah and he's not cancelling the debate. 
He's got some'cojones', I'll give him that. 
Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when there's a couple of million lives in the line. 
�S�lo quiero lo mejor para ti! 
�Y no quiero preocuparme! 
 Papa, no tengo miedo. S� lo que estoy haciendo. 
 �No sabes hija! 
Soy suficiente grande para hacer mis proprias decisiones! 
Claudia! 
 What's going on? 
 Nothing. Everything's fine. 
Don't tell me nothing! 
Why are you arguing with your father? 
Please, Hector, it doesn't matter. 
He's not happy with how I live my life. 
You mean he doesn't like you being with me? 
�Piensa que su hija es muy buena para mi? 
Por su puesto que no, se�or. 
Don't raise your voice to your father ever again. 
Claudia, no! 
How I conduct myself with my father is my concern. Not yours! 
Good. 
Now that's said. 
Tell Lucia and to prepare supper, ok? 
Ok, I'll tell him. 
 Almeida  Tony, it's Chloe. I just get off the phone with Jack. They've just arrived. 
All right, is there a problem? 
Jack's not going to use the transmitters. 
Why not? 
He says that would take too long to wire them up. 
Whatever. Look, you're learning point from his side, any information he digs up I want it right away. You got it? 
Ok, you don't have to yell. 
No one's yelling, Chloe. 
Look, we got a body infected with a deadly virus. 
Somehow, we have to tie it to Salazar in the next 3 hours. 
Right now, Jack's location is our only lead. 
So, I need you to keep me up to the minute. 
Understood? 
 I already said ok. 
 Good, then get on it. 
Detective Fisher. 
Yeah, you're Bauer? 
Yeah. He's my partner, Chase Edmunds. 
What's the activity? 
No one's get in and out since we got here. 
How is the inside layout. 
About 30 people total, spread out on all floors. 
The apartment you asked the case is the corner one there on the third floor. 
You didn't go in there, right? 
I was ordered to stand down until you got there. 
 Good. 
 How much back up you want? 
None. Right now I want your men just to cover the exits. 
None? There's 30 scumbags in there. 
Yeah, we don't want to set off any alarms. 
Two of us can sneak in without a fight. 
You're sure about that? 
Yeah. Get this open on channel 1, we'll let you know when we want you to come in. 
You're ready? 
Let's go. 
You got it. 
The stair is not open to the public? 
Just take it easy, sport. 
We're not here to take anybody down. 
We just want a little information. 
They come! 
Chase! 
Get back! 
Come on! 
Chase, we got a runner! 
Don't even think about it! 
I'm clean, I've got nothing on me! 
Shut up, stupid! 
You've just fired a federal agent. 
You'd better start talking to me. 
Or I will let you bleed to death right here on this landing. 
Chase! I got him, we're down there! 
Hey Fisher, we got him. We got our suspect. 
 Who is David Goss? 
 Goss is a dealer, I just score for him sometimes. 
Well not anymore. He's dead. 
Ok, he's dead. 
Don't be a smartass. 
Who is his supplier? 
Who is his supplier? 
Chase! 
A guy Carlos Corretja, he works in Tijuana! 
Corretja is one of Salazar's mid- level distributors. 
You're doing business with him? 
I'm supposed to call him tonight. 
Corretja wanted me to find a mule, someone clean without a record. 
What for? 
He wanted to move a small bag of coke across the border. 
 It didn't make any sense to me! 
 Why not? 
He payed $10, 000 to bring it up. 
Coke isn't even worth that much. 
 Where's the bag of coke now? 
 The guy who brought it across still has it. 
 What's his name? 
 His name is Kyle, Kyle Singer. 
Sorry Helen, it's business... 
What is...What is this? 
It's a final announce. 
If you don't pay the rent by tomorrow morning 8 am, I'm calling city services and they start the eviction process. 
Don...Don't do this, no please! 
I'm gonna have it in a couple of days. 
I can't take care of you. 
I'll get back. 
How much you own him, 'ma? 
 Stay out of this. 
 How much? 
$800. But don't you worry about it because your father is gonna talk to uncle Stanford. 
Hey! $800, right? 
And frpm now, if you have a problem, talk to me or my dad. Ok? 
Leave my mum out of it. 
I expect your receive in the mailbox. 
Where did you get that money? 
It doesn't matter. Ok? 
We needed it. 
I got it. 
Can I have everybody's attention, please? 
Everyone should be working on the name Kyle Singer. 
All right, I want points chief from department's heads on my desk in the next 5 minutes. 
Everything there is to know about Kyle Singer, I want it. 
Where he lives, where he works, and most importantly, where he's likely to be right now. 
Also, keep an open channel to Fields Ops so that Chloe can forward anything that comes in back to Jack. 
All right. Let's go! 
 What are you doing? 
 Narrowing the search space. 
I can't believe you're so stupid, Kyle. 
So, this is how you're gonna your family? 
By dealing drugs? 
I'm not dealing them. Stupid delivery. 
It's quick money which my folks need right now. 
But where they're gonna get the money to bail you out of jail, Kyle? 
Ok, you're right. 
It's stupid. I know that. 
But I did it. 
And I'm in this now. 
I'm in the middle of this... 
Look, I'll make this delivery tonight. All right? 
I promise, it's gonna be over. I promise you! 
I'm not waiting until tonight, it's over now. 
What are you talking about? 
I can't be with someone who does stuff like this. 
I'm sorry. 
Linda! 
Linda, please. 
Over, Kyle. 
Are you gonna tell me what's going on? 
We just have a little disagreement, that's all. 
Where did you get the money to pay Don? 
Mum, forget about it, please. 
What's your dad gonna say when he finds out? 
He's not gonna take "forget about it" as an aswer. 
I don't know. 
Would you excuse us, please? 
I'm sorry, Anne. 
Our schedule has been way off today. 
No! I think you were unable to join me so... 
I am not. 
I have a couple of minutes. 
I'm having your security level upgraded. 
I'm gonna need your advice today. 
What's going on? 
What do you know about type 3 immuno- viruses? 
Not a lot, they're fairly new. 
As far as I know there are several strains, most of them fast acting and all are deadly. 
Someone's threatening to release a virus here in L. A. 
Oh God! 
I need to talk to a Doctor Sunny Macer at National Health Services. 
Yeah, I know...I know Sunny. 
But David, don't you think there's a remote possiblity that this thing is for real? 
You need to get out of Los Angeles. 
That's not possible. 
The debate is in little over two hours. 
No, don't tell me about the debate. 
We're talking about an outbreak here in the city. 
This isn't something the Secret Service can't protect you against this. 
I know...I know Anne. We are prepared 
to leave if the situation warrants it. 
But right now, I need you to talk to Dr. Sunny Macer 
and learn everything you can about this thing. 
I will. 
That's ok, that's all right. 
Your brother would like to speak with you, sir. 
Well, send him in. 
He's downstairs. He requests 
that you come see him. 
Come see him? 
Yes, sir. 
He has something to show you down there. 
You go ahead, I'm gonna call Sunny. 
See you later. 
No, I'm gonna check that out myself. 
Chase is bringing the suspect in the CTU. 
I want you to set up a wait room for him now. 
I need you to take Parker down to CTU. 
What about Kyle Singer? 
I'm gonna take care of Singer. 
I want you to take care of Parker. 
Anybody can take him at CTU and set him up, I'm going with you to get Singer. 
No, you're not. 
Why are you trying to get rid of me? 
I'm not trying to get rid of you. 
I still think that Parker's got more information and I want you to get it out of him. 
Is this about Kim? 
Are you punishing me for dating your daughter? 
You listen to me. 
That kid is walking around a bag of cocaine that's got the virus and he doesn't know it. I need to find him and stop him from putting it into circulation. ~ 
Yeah, I know. That's why I wanna help you. 
But you can't, it's too dangerous. 
Too dangerous? 
You can have a both ways, Chase. 
My daughter loves you, you wanna be with her? 
Then, I have to stop putting you in harm's way. 
You're kidding, right? 
Take Parker to CTU, that's an order. 
Yeah. I call you right back. 
Excuse us for a minute. 
What is it, Wayne? 
Don't be angry, David, but I got a copy of Keeler's playbook. 
Damn it! I told you to drop that! 
You just listen to me. 
If you don't wanna use it then don't. 
But there is something you need to see. 
There's nothing I need to see. 
It's about Anne. 
Keeler is too smart to play the race card or the girlfriend card. 
It's not the one of those which is why I'm bringing this to you. 
It's something that we didn't know about her. 
Something that, if true, could... 
David, it could damage all of us. 
Just take a look at it. 
Yeah. 
Give me an update. 
Kyle is still in his house. 
What about the package? 
It's with him. 
And Ram�n? 
Just waiting to come home. 
Good. 
Gael, there you are. 
Chloe has been looking for you. 
Where is she? 
She's in I. T. 
All right. 
spirts all around us. 
They can fuse their psychic energy into objects in our everyday lives. 
You take something like this. 
This is a powerful totem. 
Through it, i can feel the future, sometimes the past, but always the truth. 
Now,whose earring am i holding? 
Uh,that's mine. 
And you are? 
 Delia. 
 Delia. 
 You're a skeptic. 
 Guilty. 
Ahh, i love skeptics. 
You're always the most fun to convince. 
Delia. 
Let's see what the spirits can tell me through this earring. 
 It is a gift. 
 That's right. 
You treasure it, but your husband didn't give it to you. 
Right again. 
I'm getting an "N" Name. 
N-n-na. 
Ned. Is that right? 
Your son gave it to you? 
That's absolutely right. 
I'm... Very impressed. 
A round of applause for skeptic delia. 
I don't know what's funnier, that you're here or that i'm here. 
 Can i get another volunteer? 
 Uh,yeah, right here.Right here. 
I hate you. 
You come to this bookstore as much as i do. 
Now give him love. 
Wonderful. 
And who do i have the pleasure of meeting? 
 Melinda. 
 Melinda. 
And you're happily married,aren't you? 
Oh. Did your little spirit friends tell you that? 
No,your wedding ring did. 
May i? 
I'm getting an "M" Name. 
Mary ann. 
Who's mary ann? 
 It's my grandmother's name. 
 You were very close, right? 
Well,yeah. 
I mean,all little girls love their grandmas, right? 
No. No,this affection caused a rift. 
A problem. Uh,your mother's war 
with her got turned against you. 
And your relationship with your father. 
He's no longer with us,is he? 
Hey,how about it,huh? 
Just keep breathing,ok? 
You,sir. 
A very strong message about you. 
 You ok? 
 yeah,i'm good. 
I'm good,i just feel like i've had a glass of wine or 15. 
 Something's here. 
 Like something something. 
No,put it into words. 
Put it into words that i can understand. 
It's ok. It's all right. 
Guess the spirits want you to buy my book. 
Is it him? Is it something he's doing? 
It's the ghost attached to him that he can't see. 
It's not a shock this guy's haunting The ghost is not a fan. 
=WWW.YDY.COM/BBS= 
Ptoudly Presents Ghost Whisperer Season 3 Episode 7 ok,check this out. 
According to this baby name website, 48% of women born in your grandma's time had "M" Names. 
Mary ann,mildred, maynard. 
 Maynard? 
 Yeah,that's how guys like casey work. 
It's called a cold reading. 
 You've heard about things like this? 
 Oh,sure. 
I'll start off with something like... 
Ok,i'm getting an "M" Name. 
'cause somebody in my family has got to have one,right? 
Like an aunt,cousin, or whatever. 
Anyway,then you take my age. You can pretty 
much assume that my grandmother's passed. 
I throw out mary ann and presto. 
Ok,but how did he know that my son's name was ned? 
I mean,that goes beyond an educated guess. 
Unless you told him without realizing it. 
No. No way. I was very careful. 
I didn't give him anything. 
Yeah,except for the fact that sometimes those guys put microphones in the audience. 
Yeah. They'll record conversations beforehand, 
And then give it back to you as if it's a part of the show. 
Do you see why i am skeptical of people who have "Gifts"? 
Whoa. Hey. 
No,not all sensitives are like that,ok? 
Just the ones who want to make a profit and don't know that there's a ghost standing behind them. 
 Are you gonna confront him about it? 
 Nope. 
That's a can of worms that i'm gonna keep closed. 
Well,maybe you are, but i'm not. 
Just stay in touch with your inner spirit. 
Thank you. 
 can i have your  How you doing? 
yeah Thank you. 
 thank you  Hi. Oh,delia. 
Casey. Hey,good memory. 
Not really. 
Spirit guides told me i'd see you again. 
I bet they did. 
 Hey,can i ask you a question? 
 Sure. 
Um,did you use a microphone to pick up my son's name? 
I most certainly did not. 
Does it ever hurt your conscience, doing what you do? 
 Excuse me. 
 thanks Because people believe you,you know. 
They trust you. 
And you just string them along with your parlor act. 
What i do is no act. 
I've consulted with celebrities,politicians, and no one has ever asked for their money back. 
Just because you convince a lot of people doesn't mean it's true. 
Ok,if i am such a fraud,why have i been asked to consult on the sydney drake disappearance? 
The police called you in on that? 
The family did. 
I'm gonna find this girl. 
And when i do, maybe i'll make a believer out of you. 
Look at this family. 
It's just been the mom and the 2 girls ever since the dad died a couple of years ago. 
 Is that sydney on the right? 
 Yeah. 
The drake family made a small fortune with real estate holdings in town. 
You know,jim was telling me something about this. 
And he said the police were totally frustrated 'cause the night that she went missing everything was in perfect condition. 
The bed was made, cell phone and keys were on the table. 
And the kidnappers didn't even make any demands. 
No note,no clues,nothing for the police to go on. 
Can you imagine how that must feel? 
Your child just vanishes and you have no idea what happened? 
Sad thing is it's been 2 weeks. 
In most cases, if they haven't been found in a couple of days Yeah,i know. 
There isn't any way that you could go and talk to mrs. Drake is there? 
Why would i want to do that? 
Just because casey is gonna go there and spin whatever story he wants. 
But if you get there first,you might, i don't know, see something. 
Wait a minute,  i thought you didn't buy what i do. 
 I don't. 
But i buy what casey does even less. 
If it were me,mel, if this was my kid,the last thing i would want is somebody lying to me about it. 
So,how can i help you, melinda? 
I know that this is none of my business. 
I just don't want to see your family get hurt. 
Ahh,too late. 
I know that you're consulting with casey edgars. 
 You know casey's work? 
 I know his type. 
Oh. Well,you're not the first 
person to warn me about him, but he confirmed what i know in my heart Sydney is out there. 
He'll tell me where she is. 
Look,um... 
I have some insight into the supernatural as well. 
And the casey edgars of the world are just trying to take advantage of people's pain. 
It's really not as easy as just closing your eyes and seeing where somebody is. 
Do you communicate with spirits? 
Do you know anything about sydney? 
No. No,i don't know anything,but... 
I wouldn't make you promises until i had proof. 
Oh,excuse me. 
Who's there? 
Hey. 
Hey,what do you want? 
Why won't you just talk to me? 
Please. 
What are you doing in here? 
What happened? 
Uh,i--i'm sorry.I heard this strange noise. 
That's why i came in here. 
I was talking to your mom. 
Yeah,i heard you two. 
I know exactly what you are. 
You're another one of those phony psychics poking through our house. 
No,please,that's not what this is. 
It's just the feeding frenzy doesn't stop around here. 
Nikki. 
You know,i think i've come at a bad time. 
But if you want to talk some more, I'd--i really would love to help. 
Well,there is someone here who would like to speak to you. 
Excuse me? 
Casey,this is the woman i was just telling you about, Melinda gordon. 
We've met. 
So what did you do? 
Well,i got out of there as fast as i could. 
The last thing i wanted was a showdown with the guy. 
And you didn't see sydney's ghost? 
No. I saw the ghost 
that's been haunting casey instead. 
Wait,does that mean the ghost is attached to you now since he knows you can see him and casey can't? 
i don't know. 
It's too hard to figure out when he's making me this woozy. 
You shou have seen the look in her eyes. 
I mean,she was calm on the outside, but her heart was breaking. 
You know,and who am i to take away her hope? 
Please tell me tha what i do is not as bad as casey. 
What you do has nothing to do with casey. 
Why are you doing this to me? 
What do you want? 
Stop it. 
Please,you know that i can't hear you. 
 are you worried? 
 Am i worried about finding sydney drake? 
Of course. 
Listening to the spirits is not an exact science. 
You have to be attuned to everything. 
You never know what the spirits might send your way. 
 here you go   alright Keep the change. 
You have a ghost attached to you. 
Tell me something i don't already know. 
No,i'm not talking about your inner spirit. 
I'm talking about a real ghost. 
He's wearing a red plaid shirt, Loose jeans, and hiking boots. 
So,sounds like a ghost. 
You've actually seen it? 
Yes. And he's angry with you. 
And he had a message. 
He wanted me to make you tell the truth. 
Oh,really? About what? 
I'm sure there could be any number of things, but i'm gonna start with the fact that you don't know anything about where sydney drake is. 
Oh,i get it. 
I'm cutting in on your turf. 
Are you the town psychic or something? 
Uh,this has nothing to do with turf. 
It has to do with 2 words--Paranormal envy. 
I am here because a ghost has a message for you. 
You can do with that whatever you want. 
ok. 
Maybe you have a gift. 
Or maybe you just think you do. 
But the real struggle is hiding it. 
You've had this gift since you were a little girl and that's the worst time to be different. 
Are you a psychic or a therapist? 
You couldn't get rid of this gift. 
So you open up a nice little business. 
It keeps you in contact with people who recently lost loved ones, Like,um... 
Selling antiques. 
Oh,you really are touching. 
I told the truth. Mission accomplished. 
Oh,and one more thing. 
Sydney drake is alive. 
If you're mad because i beat you to the punch, I make no apologies. 
This is the big leagues. 
A girl is missing. 
Step aside, let the professionals handle it. 
Hey. Wait. 
Nikki. 
I didn't mean to spy on you. 
There's just been so much media attention since sydney disappeared. 
I definitely don't want to get recognized checking out a so-called psychic. 
So,when were you listening to us and how much did you hear? 
Enough. 
What you were saying to casey and my mom, that you can see the dead. 
Is it true? 
Yeah,it's true. 
Have you seen my sister? 
No,i haven't. 
But that doesn't mean anything. 
It's just that... 
I think my sister is dead. 
I don't think my mother can face that. 
She wishes it was me. 
 That's not true. 
 It is. 
My mom pushed us both, but sydney was the one who always succeeded. 
She had all the brains. 
She sailed into medical school. 
 Were you two close? 
 Not as close as sydney and my mother. 
When dad died, it just got worse. 
It was all about sydney. 
She was mommy's little princess. 
Sydney used to call me the toad. 
I'm sure that she knew how much you loved her. 
I need your help. 
Ok,explain to me again how this isn't a seance. 
Because the one we're looking for is alive,i guess. 
Casey calls it a visitation. 
This guy is so pretentious it makes me want to throw up. 
Oh,what i wouldn't give to see this. 
The real deal vs. The real real deal. 
Honey? 
Mel? Honey? 
Uh...i'm gonna-- i'm gonna call you back. 
I am just a portal. 
I can feel the love and belief of everyone in this room and so can my guides. 
They are here with us. 
Now. 
Every single person has a different spirit watching over them, Protecting them. 
Now,show us what we seek. 
Please shine a lot on sydney drake, beloved daughter, sister,friend. 
Please show us where she is. 
I see her. 
Where? Where is she? 
She's alive. She's close. 
There's a man next to her. 
A man wearing a red sweatshirt. 
Yes,i can see it clearly now. 
His shirt is red,and he's wearing hiking boots. 
Are you kidding me? 
i'm right here. 
I'm standing right behind you. 
I'm not alive, you liar. I'm dead. 
Sydney? 
you have to tell them the truth. 
you have to tell them that i'm dead. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yes,i'm fine. I'm so sorry. 
Melinda,did you say my daughter's name? 
Look,i know how this is gonna sound. 
Yes. 
Sydney's spirit was here with us. 
And she wanted me to tell you that she's not alive. 
I'm so sorry. 
Do not listen to her. 
Your daughter is alive. 
This woman is trying to sabotage my work. 
She came to me earlier claiming i was a fraud, and now she says she's a seer? 
What are you talking about? 
I was invited to come here. 
Why are you using your doubt to block me? 
Why have you insinuated yourself in this family, taking away their only hope? 
What kind of scam are you running? 
I am not running any scam. 
And you're the only one that's getting paid. 
We're not paying him. 
We offered him money several times, but he said no. 
I know what i saw. 
Lower. 
Lower. 
Ooh,not that low. 
Casey went for blood,huh? 
The only thing that guy values more than his paycheck is some good p.r. 
I can't believe he accused me of scamming them. 
I mean,why didn't i see that coming? 
Hey,it wasn't a total loss. 
At least you found out the truth about sydney. 
 Poor girl. She's dead,huh? 
 Right. 
And we know that the ghost wasn't attached to casey, that it was attached to the drake family. 
Yeah,but then why was she at the book signing? 
Because nikki was there trying to check out casey. 
Why would the fair sydney drake be wearing men's clothes? 
i mean, Any ideas about that? 
None,but if that's how she's appearing to me, then that is the clothes she died in. 
This sense of you feeling dizzy, Are you still feeling that? 
Yeah,which makes me think that she was drugged, Which is why i go through reefer madness every time she appears, And why she's remember things in bits and pieces. 
Is there any way i can talk to one of your cop friends? 
On a cold case file, sure. 
But on an on-going investigation, it's just not gonna happen. 
Sorry. 
 There is one person you could talk to. 
 Who? 
Casey. 
Now you're on drugs. 
Ok,go with me for a second,all right? 
Look,obviously this guy's not a sensitive. 
But from the way you describe him, He's a profiler. 
Well,maybe he's a good one. 
He's close to the drake family. 
They probably let him talk to the cops. 
He might have clues he doesn't even know he has. 
 I hate this idea. 
 Yeah,i know. 
But if you can get casey on your side, You might have a better chance of crossing this ghost over, And that's really what it's all about,huh? 
I hate this idea. 
It wouldn't hurt to ask. 
 I hate this idea. 
 Me,too, believe me. 
So why would i work with you on this? 
Because at the end of the day, it's not about us. 
It's about sydney. 
We both want to help this family. 
You're good at picking up on clues about people and their behavior, and you might see something i miss. 
I'm a solo act. I don't need your help. 
Yes,you do. 
You've got nothi on sydney and you know it. 
I've seen her. I know she was drugged. 
I know that she died with handcuffs around her wrists. 
You think she's dead. I think she's still alive. 
We're not exactly a mind meld. 
All the more reason to find out the truth. 
oh,please tell me you are not actually trying to figure out the definition of "Truth." 
I'm consulting with the spirit guides. 
All right,tell your spirit guides this: If we find sydney, i'll step away and you can take all the credit. 
If we don't,then i'll never bother you again. 
The spirit guides have spoken. 
So,your thing is crossing over,right? 
Into the light? 
Yeah,that's my thing. 
What's in the light? 
I've never really crossed over, so i don't know. 
Your knowledge of the paranormal is really limited. 
You should tell people that ghosts reside on 9 planes of existence. 
It sounds smarter. Just a suggestion. 
Can we focus on the ghost,please? 
Right. Uh,let's see what we have 
Handcuffs,drugs, outdoor clothing. 
What else we got? 
Frogs. 
Excuse me? 
I heard them the other night out of nowhere Hundreds,maybe even thousands. 
What does that mean? 
I was hoping it meant something to you. 
It's a signal that sydney wants me to have. 
I just can't figure it out. 
All right,well, let's forget for a moment what frogs might mean to sydney. 
 What do they mean to you? 
 How is that relevant? 
Most paranormal experiences begin as an inward exercise. 
The answer might not be some vague mystery out there. 
It might be some specific thing that you already know. 
Like what? 
Maybe the spirit is trying to communicate with us through your memories,give us a clue. 
 Just close your eyes. 
 No. 
Free associate. 
When you think of frogs, you think of... 
Gross. 
All right, that's a start. What else? 
Warts. 
Kermit. Girl scouts. 
You know, Jim and i went camping for the first time last year, And we had to move because the sound of the frogs was so loud. 
Where was that? 
Red mountain forest. 
You know,i don't mind sharing credit with you. 
As long as you present yourself as my prot? 
Of course. 
 You don't like me,do you? 
 Not much. 
Why not? I'm so likeable. 
I don't like what you do. 
Ah. You don't approve of me. 
That's different. Less personal. 
No,it's personal. 
Heh. You're made 
because i make a living at this and you don't? 
I don't want to. 
Oh,i do, and that makes me bad? 
Look,i just think it's wrong,ok? 
To make up little messages from the other side. 
Like,"My spirit guides are telling me that your mom and dad are really proud of you and will always love you." 
What if mom and dad aren't proud? 
What if what they  really wanted to say was something meaningful but painful? 
You just tell people whatever it is that they want to hear, And that's the part i don't approve of. 
Listen,i help people. 
It's the best part of what i do. 
And the afterlife i believe in doesn't have ghosts running around spreading terrible news to the living. 
So,if my gift allows me to tell right away what someone needs to hear, what's the harm in saying it? 
No one has ever been helped by being lied to. 
Ok,this is it. This is where we went camping. 
 Wait. Do you hear that? 
 Yeah. 
Ok,there's gotta be something over here. 
What is that? 
A body. 
It's her. 
 I can't go down there. 
 Excuse me? 
I have a problem with death, specifically,dead bodies. 
Casey,you said that you talk to the dead. 
No,i talk to spirits. 
Corpses are something totally different. 
Ok,fine. Well, 
step aside and let the professionals handle it. 
Is that really her? 
Yeah,look at her wrists. 
 She was held. 
 Yeah. 
And if she was wandering around drugged, then she escaped... 
I'm guessing from somewhere close by. 
You really saw her. 
Protect her. 
Ealing with cops. They always complicate things. 
You're the one who wanted to take all the credit. 
I don't deal with cases like these. 
Do you think sydney crossed over? 
No. 
I think we only got a small piece of the puzzle. 
And now we have to figure out who did this to her. 
She said, "Protect her." 
 Protect who? 
 I don't know. 
Maybe she was talking about herself. I mean, 
there's something there. We're just missing it. 
Yeah,something ways bothered me about her... 
The handcuffs.I mean, 
there are a million easier ways to kidnap someone. 
Such as? 
Drugs,restraints-- simple coercion,even. 
If you're using handcuffs, you're an amateur. 
You didn't do  your homework. 
You're winging it. 
 You got all that from handcuffs? 
 No,it's just a hunch. 
I really thought she was alive. 
I really thought i could feel it. I 
Look,i think you did feel something Her presence. It was just her ghost. 
Maybe i do have something. 
You know what? Be careful what you wish for. 
A lot of responsibility comes with this gift, and it's not always just giving people hope. 
Sometimes you have to give them bad news. 
You think i should tell the drakes. 
It'll be easier coming from you. 
Jim? 
Time for your bathroom break. 
jim  no! 
 Hey,no,shh,hey, It was a dream. 
Shh,quiet. It's all right. 
It was a vision Something that happened to sydney. 
She was in a place, like a cabin or something. 
And they had her handcuffed to the bed, and she hit a guy  with a mirror. 
What guy? 
It was the guy that was holding her,except... 
He had your face. 
 And you had to hit it with a mirror? 
 No,i get it now. 
Casey was right. 
She's using my life to tell her story. 
How do i fit in? 
She's telling me that she was taken by someone she loved. 
Hello. 
Hey,melinda. 
Ok. All right,thanks. 
You think someone in her family killed her? 
Or has taken her, anyway. 
In the vision,she used this guy's clothes to go through the woods. 
 You saw the cabin in the vision? 
 No. 
But i've seen some just like it on red mountain. 
We know if the police found anything, they'd be all over this area. 
Yeah,but you and i haven't been to this area. 
 Is this the cabin from your vision? 
 It looks like it. 
What are you doing? 
Remember when you were talking about psychic energy infusing with everyday objects? 
Yeah. 
I think you might have been right. 
Brandon? 
She can't take much more. 
Brandon! 
we have to go. 
We know that this is gonna be hard for you to hear. 
But we wanted you to be the first to know brandon took sydney. 
That's not all. 
He had help. 
Who? 
You. 
me? 
You think i did this to my sister? 
You were the forgotten child. 
You were living in sydney's shadow. 
Even after she was gone, You still couldn't get your mother's attention. 
You and your boyfriend, you planned the whole thing. 
You guys are so far off. You don't have a clue. 
Brandon is sydney's ex-boyfriend,not mine. 
Just tell us what happened. 
Sydney was not as perfect as everybody thought. 
I don't have to explain anything to you. 
The cops are gonna connect brandon's clothes. 
It's only a matter of time. 
Wait a minute. 
Think about sydney's message, "Protect her." 
Yeah? 
Well,what if she meant from this? 
What if she meant "Protect nikki"? 
Will you just let me talk to you? Please 
Please,look, i'm not here to judge you,ok? 
But you're gonna have to tell the truth sooner or later. 
Not to you,i don't. 
I know that your sister loves you. 
And i know that she wants me to protect you. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because she told me. 
Did you kill your sister? 
Do you know what the worst thing is about being  the star of a family? 
The expectations. 
So,what happened? 
She started taking pills... 
First,so she could stay awake. 
Then,so she could get through finals. 
Then,because she couldn't live without them. 
By the time she got to med school, it was,like, the perfect storm. 
She was pushing herself harder than she ever had. 
She had easier access  to prescriptions. 
There were times when i wondered what my mother would think of her wonder girl turning into a drug addict. 
I thought about telling her. 
But then i just realized she would resent me even more for bursting the bubble. 
I tried to cfront sydney about it. 
 I'll quit tomorrow. I swear. 
 No,you won't! 
You've said that before. 
Please,please,i have my chem final tomorrow. 
No,give me those Don't you do that. Oh,my god,nikki! 
No...what did you do?! 
nikki,no! 
Nikki, what are you doing?! 
God! Please! Nikki! 
That was the last conversation we had. 
 How does brandon fit in? 
 He went out with sydney in college. 
She taught him the secrets of staying up 3 nights in a row to study. 
But he got addicted,too, except that he got help. 
Sydney didn't want to. That's why they broke up. 
And that's why you called him for help. 
I called him because i knew how he had kicked his habit. 
He had some friends take him to an abandoned cabin so he could go cold turkey. 
It's the hardest way to go, but it was the only thing he could do. 
So,it was was never a kidnapping. 
It was an intervention. 
We thought we could do it in private. 
get me out of here,please! 
We moved her to this cabin after she passed out. 
Let me go! 
We took turns taking care of her Feeding her, getting her through it. 
Who did this? Who did this?! 
Get me out of here! 
I went out for an hour, just to get some air. 
Time for your bathroom break. 
 But when i did... 
 Brandon,no. 
Brandon took her to the bathroom and she hit him. 
She put his clothes on and left. 
We searched for hours...days. 
But we couldn't find her. 
Why didn't you call the police? 
We just kept telling ourselves that she would show up... 
Back at school or home. 
Then it just started to snowball. 
We didn't want my mom knowing what was wrong with sydney. 
And i didn't want her knowing what i had done. 
I knew mom would really hate me if anything happened to sydney because of me. 
And then she called the police. 
And i was so scared. 
I didn't know what to do. 
So,i did nothing. 
I don't believe you. 
I would have known if sydney had a problem like that. 
She would have told me. I would have seen it. 
No,you wouldn't have,mom. 
You only saw flaws in me, not sydney. 
 That's not true. 
 It is. 
It is true. 
Susan... 
Sydney is here with us, right now. 
And she wants you to listen to nikki. 
No. This is some trick. 
The two of you couldn't stand each other, and now you're working together? 
I trusted you. 
But you are a fraud and a liar, just like the rest. 
If i wanted to lie to you, I'd tell you what you want to hear. 
Get out of my house. 
Now. 
Tell her it's time for the training wheels to come off. 
She says it's time for the training wheels to come off. 
That's something my dad used to say... 
Whenever someone was complaining something was too hard. 
I know how difficult this must be for you. 
But sydney does have a message for you. 
She can't move on until you hear it. 
I know nikki was trying to help me. 
I couldn't find my way through those woods. 
I just fell. 
Please tell her to believe me. 
She knows that you were just trying to help her and everything that happened wasn't your fault. 
I don't deserve that. 
I don't deserve forgiveness. 
She lost so much because of me. 
And that's why i had to stay here. 
I had to make sure mom wouldn't be too hard on her, Wouldn't see her as a disappointment. 
She doesn't want you to blame nikki. 
Nikki did what she did because she loved me. 
Even though mom always put her second, even though  she lived in my shadow, She looked out for me. 
Tell her nikki needs her now more than ever. 
I want my mom to see her, to know her... 
Not who my mom wants her to be, but who she is. 
It's her turn now. 
I'll tell her. 
You were always the princess. 
I was the toad. 
I think i can go now. 
She's ready to cross over. 
Bye-bye,sweetheart. 
Tell them i'm happy now. 
They should be,too. 
She's happy now. She's at peace. 
There are some things she wanted us to tell you... 
go from your heart. 
Sarah Mclachlan "world on fire" Sydney loves you. 
I just don't know how to describe that experience So simple but yet so profound. 
No smoke and mirrors, just people trying to reach out to each other. 
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 
Nikki gonna be ok? 
Yeah,i think so. 
County said they wouldn't file any charges. 
You know,if i could do what you do, I would shout it from the rooftops. 
In fact, i can't do what you do, but i still shout it from the rooftops. 
You have a gift, you kn An instinct about people, to make them see things they're not aware of. 
I couldn't have done this without you. 
Thank you. 
Uh,excuse me, are you casey edgars? 
 Uh,yes. 
 Oh,can i...please? 
Previous on 24. 
What's going on with Jack Bauer? 
The operation wasn't completely successful. 
They do have Saunders' daughter, but they were unable to remain covert. 
So, Saunders knows we have her? 
No, not yet, but CTU is estimating he will find out within the hour. 
The deadline for his next demand is gonna be up here in about 15 minutes. 
Now, giving this guy a list of every foreign operative on our payroll is an act of treason. 
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand. 
We have run out of time. 
We need you to call your father. 
And tell him what? 
Anything. We just want you to keep him on the line. 
 Jane? 
 Hi, Dad. 
What's wrong? 
I told you only to use this number in an emergency. 
Someone is monitoring the call. 
They've got her. 
There's a man named Jack Bauer with you, isn't there? 
Hand the phone to him. 
You know how many vials I have, and what I am capable of. 
You know what I am capable of, too. 
Stephen Saunders This is Jack Bauer. 
You are completely surrounded. 
The President is refusing to capitulate to any further demands. 
The only way you are getting out of this thing alive is coming through the front door with your hands on your head. 
That's not exactly true, Jack. 
I'd like to offer you congratulations on your wife eluding infection from the virus. 
How do you know about my wife? 
I don't know exactly what they are doing to her, Tony. 
But I did instruct them to leave her barely functional so that we can return her to you. 
There are 5 agents watching the northeast exit of this building. 
Send them to the front entrance. 
Michelle will be dead if you don't do what I say. 
This is Tony Almeida. 
What are we doing? 
Move everyone to the front now. 
Get in your car, move to the front of the building Down, down The following takes place between 9:00 am and 10:00 am. 
Stephen Saunders, this is your final warning. 
Come out of the building now. 
Smoke him out Release the tear gas. 
Send them in Perimeter teams, move in. Move in 
All right, boys, let's go, let's go Move Baker Why aren't you covering the south perimeter? 
CTU moved us off our position They said you needed us out front. 
What are you talking about? Why would they do that? 
They said the SAT feed showed Saunders moving toward a blind spot in front of the building. 
All teams respond. I repeat, all teams respond. 
Any sign of Saunders? 
Jack, we are in.There's no sign of him yet. 
Who gave you that order? 
Tony Move your team back to their marks now.Move 
 CTU, Almeida  Tony, it's Jack Baker just told me you pulled his team out of position. 
Yeah. I was working off the information I had. 
It was bad information. 
You should have cleared it with me. 
Somebody in my team made a mistake. 
I am not going to get into it now. 
Tony, that's an unacceptable mistake. 
I have tactical command in the field. 
If you can't run CTU, you'd better replace yourself with someone who can. 
 Chase, check in. 
 Yeah, Jack We covered the entire building, he is not here. 
Dame it Saunders doesn't seem to be in the building. 
What do you mean, he's not in there? 
He's got to be in there. 
He's gone. What were you just telling Jack about 
someone in your group making a mistake? 
Never mind. 
Adam, are we sure we tracked Saunders to the right building? 
Of course we did, Tony He was in there when Jack made that phone call I am pulling up imagery now to see what went wrong I will take care of that. 
You stay with Chloe, cover the site teams Almeida. 
I hope you covered your tracks and purged the incriminating satellite frames. 
I did what you wanted me to.Now where's my wife? 
Not so fast.I like to do things in phases. 
You should know that by now.That was phase one. 
Next, we have to talk about my daughter. 
What about her? 
I want her back, of course. 
Yeah, well, I want my wife back. 
Then there should be no problem. 
Where's Jane now? 
She's on her way here. She should 
be here in about 5 minutes. 
Good. When she gets there, pick the men to guard her. 
Make sure they will follow your orders without question. 
If any harm comes to my daughter, your wife dies. 
If Jane is not released when I order it, your wife dies. 
That's all you need to know. Are we clear? 
Tony, are you in there? 
Tony, President Palmer is on the line for you. 
I will do my part. You do yours. 
That's the spirit. 
Tony, are you there? 
Adam, I am here Are you ok? 
 Yeah, I am fine. Put the President through. 
 Ok,hang on. 
This is Tony Almeida. 
Please hold for the President. 
Mr. Almeida 
I just heard you lost Stephen Saunders. 
Is that true? 
Yes, sir. Unfortunately, it is. 
I thought CTU was certain of his location. 
What happened? 
We are looking into it now, sir. 
Does Saunders know we are holding his daughter? 
Yes, sir, he does. 
And she's obviously very important to him. 
Is Jane Saunders with you now? 
No. She's on her way here right now, sir. 
Mr. Almeida, I don't have to remind you how much 
security we are going to need around her today. 
She is the only thing that is standing between us and Stephen Saunders controlling the government. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
 We're aware of that. 
 Good Keep me posted. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you, sir. 
Senator, Senator Keeler, do you feel this is going to do serious damage to your campaign? 
Oh, absolutely not. 
My record on labor speaks for itself Remeber I voted againt NAFTA And I favor tax incentives for domestic manufacturing. 
And what about the other endorsements you lost? 
Who did he lose? 
AFL CIO and a couple of veteran groups. 
Why? 
Apparently, they are not pleased with his negative spin on your withdrawal from the debate Now that the threat level has been raised to red, peoplerealize you aren't the one playing politics. He is. 
We can't waste time thinking about the election right now. 
The only thing that matters is stopping Stephen Saunders. 
Would you come with me, please.Excuse us, Jerry. 
No, Adam, he was in the building.We found the room 
he was using.I just want to know how he got out. 
We are working on it, Chase. 
I will call you if we get something. 
Good What did he say? 
I don't understand this, Jack We pinpointed Saunders' location. 
He disappears into the air. 
Now CTU says they are having problems with the satellite. 
We are looking into it.Baker, this is Jack. 
I want 2 teams on patrol, 2 more on standby. Copy? 
What about us? 
We will go over to CTU. I want to be with Saunders' 
daughter when he calls us back. 
All right. 
How did Saunders get past us? 
We had every exit covered. 
Did he have access to our tracking systems? 
CTU, O'Brian Chloe, it's Jack. What are you working on? 
We are all trying to pick up a thread on Saunders. 
I am analyzing his last phone call to you to see if there's any tell on the carrier. 
Is it possible that he wasn't even in the building? 
That he was just routing his calls through there? 
No. He did that earlier at the apartment. 
Now that I have his counterfeit signature, he wouldn't be able to do it without our knowing it. 
Ok. Get back to me as soon as you have got anything. 
Something is not right here  This is CTU? 
 Yes Kim, your father wants you to know that he and Chase are on their way back. 
 With Saunders? 
 No Why not? 
He wasn't in the building They a re still trying to locate him  They haven't captured my father? 
 No. 
But he knows you have me, right? 
Yes, he does. 
Agent Forrester, Tony Almeida We are going to be putting Miss Saunders in the holding room. 
I was told you were setting up a white room for her. 
Yeah. That's changed. 
If you walk her to the back, Security will take her from there. 
You will be fine, ok? 
How are you doing? 
I can't believe that Saunders escaped. 
I mean, how could this happen? 
I thought that he was surrounded. 
It happened. Look, 
Rae Plachecki's coming here to talk to you. 
You're going to have to answer some questions about the shooting at the library. 
Ok, look, I heard the news about Michelle. 
 What news? 
 That she isn't infected. 
Oh, yeah. 
I am really glad that she's ok. That's great. 
Yeah, thanks There is on way to be exactly sure. 
Some people don't show symptoms for 5 or 6 hours. 
 Adam  Didn't they talk to you about your options? 
They said they could give me a pill... 
Adam, I need to talk to you now Sarah, hold on.I am talking to my sister right now 
The one who got infected with the virus? 
I am not even going to answer that, Chloe. 
I am sorry. I'll just wait here until you are done. 
 Chloe. 
 Adam, I am sorry, this is really important. 
I just need you to finish up as quickly as you can. 
Sarah, I am going to have to call you back as soon as I can, ok? 
Ok  I love you  I love you  What? 
 I checked with satellite navigation They said there are missing frames and they are certain it's on our end. 
What about the back up on the FGA volume? 
Gone. Not only that, they cover about 20 seconds. 
So if Saunders did escape the building it would be the exact interval So there was a glitch at exactly the wrong moment? 
Yeah. What are the chances of that? 
Not good So I am thinking Saunders has access to our system. 
Did you tell Tony yet? 
No. I want more information before I go to him. 
But I checked with Field Ops, and all their systems are accounted for. 
I need you to do the same in Comm. 
Do you really think there's someone inside CTU working for Saunders? 
That's the only thing that makes sense right now So if you could just do that, and then you could call your sister back. 
 Hey, Pete, I need few minutes. Sure thing 
How you doing? 
Why am I being treated like I have done something wrong? 
I apologize for that. 
We are just trying to keep you safe. 
This is the one place I am not safe. 
I have been thinking about it. 
You need me to get to my father, so threatening to killme or harm me is the only tool you have to use against him Tell me I am wrong. 
You are right. 
We need your father to believe we will do anything to get him. 
But we are not going to hurt you. 
I give you my word  Your word? 
 Yeah,my word I run this office and I will personally protect you. 
What about Kim's father? 
They told her that he is on his way back here. 
 What about him? 
 He scares me. 
I got the feeling he's willing to hurt me. 
Nobody's going to hurt you. 
All right? 
I wish I could believe you. 
Almeida  Has Jane arrived? 
 Yeah  Where is she? 
 She is here  Put her on. 
 No You have my wife, I want to talk to her first You don't give me orders. 
You are wrong I have your daughter which means I am in charge. 
Now if you so much as touch my wife, I will slit Jane's throat. 
Hold on Sorry for your discomfort Hopefully it's temporary.Uncuff her 
I am going to let you speak to your husband Tell him that you are ok and you are being treated well. 
Nothing else.Understood? 
Tony, it's me Michelle They won't let me say much Are you all right? 
I am fine.I am being treated well 
Don't let them do this, don't let��  None of that. 
 Michelle Let me speak with my daughter, Mr. Almeida 
It's your father.He wants to talk to you 
 Dad? 
 Yes, Jane. It's me. 
They are saying horrible things about you. 
That's what they do.Don't believe any of it 
The virus in the hotel,it's killing all of those people, you didn't do that. 
Please tell me that you didn't do that. 
Listen to me, Jane. 
The US government distorts the truth and destroys lives. 
Don't listen to any of it.It's all lies. 
Then you didn't do it? 
I'd never do something without good cause. 
You know that. 
That's all. 
Let's do these. 
What will it take for you to get her out of the building? 
I have to fabricate some clearances. 
It's going to take me about 30 to 40 minutes Contact me as soon as you are clear of CTU. 
Take down this number. 
You were right. Someone from Tony's group 
purged the frames from the surveillance feed. 
Do you know who? 
It was a no name login. 
It could have been from here or Division. 
I'd better tell Tony so he can lock down the system. 
Ok CTU, O'Brian This is Sunny Macer from Health Services. 
Sunny, what can I do for you? 
Have you heard from Michelle Dessler in the last half hour? 
No, she was sent to your office for observation. 
Well, that's actually why I am calling. 
I got a message that she asked to be taken to County instead,but she's not at County and she's definitely not here. 
We can't get ahold of her. 
I will check on it and get back to you. 
All right, thanks Davis, get me Mike Redmond. 
He's with Michelle Dessler. 
All right. 
He's not answering What do you mean he's not answering? 
He's active. He has to answer. 
He's not answering. 
Ok, I heard you the first time. 
Are you sure about this? 
Yes, Tony, of course I am sure There's 79 users in your group, and one of them has been playing games with the uplink recording All right, well We are going to have to lock everything down then Well, obviously I agree. 
You want me to do it now? 
Yeah What is it? 
Something weird is happening with Michelle. 
What do you mean? 
No one can find her, and Redmond's not answering his pages. 
That's because I overrode NHS's order. 
I didn't want them to know about it. 
I am putting Michelle in quarantine in one of our substations so she can still do some work I need every warm body I can get. 
What am I going to tell Macer? 
I will call her. 
There's something else I want you to do. 
What is it? 
I am sending you the record of a phone call between Saunders and myself from a few minutes ago. 
You just spoke to him? 
Yeah. I want you to strip away the carrier signal, 
see if you can use it to find him. 
What about the voice track? 
No, he scrambled it. It's useless. 
Fine Chloe Do it in tech one, away from everybody. 
I didn't want Adam to know about it. 
Why not? 
Well, technically it's his job. 
But you are better at it. 
Why did you just say that? 
Because it's true. 
Damn it, Mark, you assured me that going on the offensive against Palmer was the right thing to do Now it's backfiring. 
Come on, John.That's not fair 
Palmer walks out of the debate moments after you brought up the charge against his girlfriend Everyone assumed that he whole national security excuse was just a cover Well, apparently it wasn't The alert level is at red and the airports are shut down  I know. 
 All right Palmer still hasn't told the public any of the details about this threat. 
Call Alex in the Pentagon see what you can find out about it. 
Depending on what it turns out to be, I may need to be proactive and issue an apology. 
Yeah What's this about? 
All right, hold on.It's Sherry Palmer. 
She wants to come here in 5 minutes. 
 Why? 
 She wouldn't say. 
Except that it's a high value proposition, and she wants to present it face to face. 
Set it up All right, the Senator will be here. 
This should be interesting I will off load the systems in Field Ops. 
I will be right up. 
 Adam, where's Tony? 
 He's with Jane Saunders Kim's waiting to be debriefed on the shooting and I am working with NHS. 
NHS? Why aren't you tracking Saunders? 
I don't know. 
Tony put Chloe in charge of that. 
 Where's Chloe? 
 Tech one Why isn't she in Field Ops? 
You haven't talked to Tony yet? 
About what? 
Jack, it looks like someone from Tony's group intentionally wiped out those SAT frames from the Saunders' surveillance  That's how he was able to evade us. 
 What? 
Adam, NHS wants those coordinates now, or they are going to have to widen the quarantine zone. 
Ok. That's all I know, Jack. 
I got to get back on this. 
Ok, fine We may be moving you in a few minutes. 
 Where? 
 To Division. 
 What's that? 
 Yeah  Tony, it's Jack.I need to speak with you. 
Meet me outside the observation room. 
Yeah, all right.I will be right back. 
Jack,What the hell's going on? 
Adam just told me that you think you have got someone on the inside working with Saunders. 
Well, it hasn't been confirmed yet. 
Chloe's working on it. 
What's she doing? 
She's taking a look at status logs, to see if she can find anything out of the ordinary. 
Tony, if this is true, we have got to call Division, get Spec Ops down here immediately. 
I thought about that. 
But I don't want to raise any red flags. 
If someone in our group is working with Saunders, I don't want them to know that we are onto them. 
Ok, fine.You and I will work this up together. 
But I want division to come pick up Jane so they can continue questioning her. 
Good idea. 
I will call Brad Hammond, I will meet you in tech one, we'll go through everything with Chloe. 
No, wait, Jack Look, I have a 30 minute status call scheduled with Hammond, anyway Why don't you let me tell him and you can go up to Field Ops? 
Ok, fine Adam.Is Tony set up for 30 minute 
status calls with Brad Hammond? 
 If he is, it's not in the books. 
 Thanks. 
Thank you very much  John, hello  Sherry How nice to see you. I don't believe you 
know Mark Kaner, my campaign manager. 
No, I don't. Only by reputation.Pleased to meet you. 
How do you do? 
So what brings you here? 
Well, actually, it's a private mater, John. 
Let us have a minute, Mark No problem Please I heard about the endorsements you lost this morning. 
Daily fluctuation. It doesn't mean a thing. 
Doesn't mean a thing That's pretty optimistic, John. 
No, your campaign is imploding. 
By the time the press has a chance to analyze all the mistakes you made last night You will look like a desperate candidate gasping his last breath. 
Look, Sherry, if you just came here to insult me, I am rather busy No, no, no, John. 
On the contrary. Relax. 
I, I came here because I can guarantee you a win in November. 
John, what I am about to tell you, I will deny to my grave if you try to hold it against me. 
So that's clear, right? 
John, we are clear on that, right? 
Good David Palmer is an accessory to murder. 
 Who's murder? 
 Alan Milliken Alan Milliken died of a heart attack. 
Yes, he did, but he didn't have to. 
His nitroglycerin was just an arm's length away. 
But he couldn't get to it because someone kept it from him. 
Now how could you possibly know that? 
Because that someone was me. 
Sherry, I think you had better leave right now. 
Really? 
So you can watch your entire career leave with me? 
If what you are saying is true, I don't want to have anything to do with you. 
Oh, come on, spare me, John. 
You haven't gotten this far without getting a little dirt under your fingernails. 
I don't know what you are talking about. 
No. Of course not. 
But for the sake of conversation, just allow me to paint you a picture. 
I�� Please, it won't take but a moment Just indulge me. 
Very well David lied to the Chief of Police last night in order to provide an alibi for me. 
And I can prove that he lied. 
No, you think about that. 
Proof that the President of the United States lied to cover a murder. 
What kind of proof? 
Besides my confession? 
I have the prescription bottle he was reaching for. 
I was holding it. 
And I have it in a very safe place. 
You are talking about incriminating yourself. 
You would go to prison. 
Yes, I know that. 
But so would David David lied to the police to save himself. 
It's quite simple, John All you have to do is go to David and tell him that you have this evidence This medicine bottle with my fingerprints on it And I guarantee you David will drop out of the race. 
The party will be thrown into turmoil and nobody, I mean nobody will be able to touch you come November. 
And for all of this? 
You will put me on the White House staff. 
Nothing so high that it will raise too many eyebrows. 
All of this for you to be a mid level staffer in my administration? 
You and I both know that it would be a little more than that. 
So you are saying the casualty estimates have been projected upward. 
Yes sir, I am afraid so By a factor of how many? 
Now that the virus is out of the hotel and not completely contained. 
It could be as high as times five All right, thanks, Dan. Keep me posted. 
Yes, sir. 
What's it? 
I just got off the phone with one of my sources over at Keeler's headquarters. 
Sherry was there meeting privately with Keeler. 
 When? 
 Just now Meeting Keeler about what? 
He didn't know. David 
So I was hoping you'd have some idea. 
I don't know what she's doing. 
But we can't worry about that now. 
There are people dying here in Los Angeles. 
Yeah, well, I don't like it, David  So let me put someone on this. 
 No. 
I brought Sherry in to fix a problem, and look what happened. 
Just let it be. 
We will hear soon enough. 
What do you see? 
They are trying to use the open phone switches to find us. 
The phone I called him with is shut off. 
They can't triangulate me, can they? 
Not quickly. 
But they can try a trial and error process and that could get them close. 
And that's what they are doing? 
Looks like it Then we will have to stop them Come with me Your office is using our last phone conversation to locate us. 
How are they doing it? 
I am committed to getting my daughter back. 
You kill me and that'll never happen. 
That's not the only option. 
You are an attractive woman. 
I am guessing your husband would prefer you returned without a disfigurement. 
I am not telling you anything. 
I have to talk to Almeida. 
Keep your conversation short. 
Almeida.Let me paint you a picture 
I have a sharp knife, the tip of which is drawing blood from your wife's face right now. 
If whatever you are doing to trace these phone calls doesn't stoop in 30 seconds, she'll be unrecognizable. 
O'Brian Shut down the trace. 
Shut it down?I am just starting to get something. 
Do it now, Chloe. 
fine.Let me at least see if I can unscramble the audio 
No, I need you to hold off for a few minutes. 
This doesn't make sense, Tony I thought you wanted me to find Saunders. 
I do. I will explain it to you later. 
What are you doing? 
I am trying to pick up a thread on Saunders. 
Somebody in my own group may be working against us, I have quarantine zones springing up all over the place I am treading water here, Jack Why are you lying to me? 
Lying? What are you talking about? 
I just got off the phone with Hammond. 
You didn't have a status call scheduled. 
I screwed up earlier. 
The SAT transmission on my system was forged by my own people. 
I should have noticed that it wasn't authentic before I ordered Baker off his post, I didn't By the time I realized my mistake, it was too late. Saunders was gone. 
What about the missing frames? 
They must have been deleted by the same person who forged the SAT transmission. 
Look, I know this is big, Jack, and I promise you I will offer my resignation when this day is over. 
Right now we got too much going on for me to step down. 
Making a mistake is one thing. 
Covering it up is another. 
I can't let you stay in place. 
I am taking over command of CTU now. 
I made a mistake, Jack No, Tony You made two Fine. I will make sure Adam sends over 
everything I have got to your group. 
Tony, I narrowed down the list. 
What list? 
The list of people on your team that can't account for their time when the SAT frames went missing Oh, yeah, right. 
Tony, it's very likely that someone on this list is working from within CTU to help Saunders. 
Look, Adam, I am not in charge of CTU anymore. 
What are you talking about? 
Jack and I have decided it'd be best if he took over. 
Why don't you send that list over to Hammond, all right? 
Yes I got a problem What problem? 
Jack Bauer just relieved me of my command Why did he do that? 
He found out I'd deleted those satellite frames. 
Does he know about our communication? 
No, not yet. He thinks I am just covering my mistake. 
But he's gonna find out soon. 
Then I suggest you get my daughter out of there before he does. 
Look, I might not be able to do this. 
I no longer have any authority at CTU. 
You don't' need authority, Tony. 
You just need to know that if you don't deliver Jane for whatever reason, your wife will die just like Ryan Chappelle died. 
Just like the people at the Chandler Plaza Hotel died. 
I am gonna try to get her out, but if I can't If you can't, Michelle dies. 
Don't call me again until you have Jane safely away  Dad. Kim, I need you to help me with something 
You are gonna have to clear it with Tony He wants me to debrief with Rae Plachecki about what's going on with Jane Saunders. 
Tony just stepped down. 
I am acting director of CTU until further notice. 
What do you mean Tony stepped down? 
Tony's hiding something from me. 
I need you to help me find out what it is. 
Why me? 
Because right now I don't know who to trust. 
I need you to maintain a surveillance on every station here at CTU Anyone who checks in or out, and I also want you to track communications that flag higher than a code 2. 
Where do you want me to do that? 
Field Ops. Come on. 
Thanks Almeida Good news, Tony What is it? 
I found a way to pull the voice track on the phone call you had with Saunders. 
Have you listened to it yet? 
No. The algorithm is still running. 
But once that's complete, I will be able to do an analysis on the ambient sound and room tone. 
All right, good work Adam, I want you to send your volumes up to Kim's computer I have her checking something for me. 
Ok Is Chloe still in Tech One? 
As far as I know, she is. 
Have her come up to my office, I need to speak with her. 
Ok, I will, Jack Kaufman Yeah, Adam, I am on the line with Chloe We need the password to Etudes 4 It's BCF19 All right, thanks Yeah, Oh, Tony, Jack needs to see Chloe in his office right away. 
All right, I will tell her Thank you Where is she? 
She is here Put her on No You have my wife, I want to talk to her first You have my wife, I want to talk to her first You have my wife? 
Hello? Hello? 
���� Help, somebody help, I am locked in Tech one, I am locked in Just hold on for a second Everybody, can I have your attention? 
Just stop working for a second. I need your attention. 
From this point forward, I am taking command of CTU. 
That includes Field Ops and all communications. 
Tony Almeida has stepped down. 
He is no longer in charge. 
I am taking Jane Saunders to Division. 
Here's the order. 
I don't have time to go into details, because right now we have to focus on finding Stephen Saunders. 
Come on, Pete, this is the order right here. 
You don't believe me, call Division talk to them yourself. 
So unless you are working directly with NHS in defining the quarantine zones, I need you to get involved. 
Check with your superiors, they will hand out your assignments. 
We need to find this guy. Now. 
We are leaving right now. 
Ok We are going out this way Chase, Chloe hasn't refreshed her current tables in over 15 minutes. 
I thought she was working on the main system. 
Yeah, she was That's weird She never forgets to do that What's going on? 
Have you seen Chloe? 
Yeah, she's over in Tech One Where are all the guards? 
We don't need those guards anymore. 
Why not? I thought you were worried about 
my father sending men in to get me We have agents on the streets, don't worry about it Kim, why can't I get a feed on Tech One? 
Hang on Someone blocked it. 
We have a hostile inside. 
Override the access code now. 
Perimeter security, I need a 20 on Chloe O'Brian. 
And a priority one sweep of the entire building Cover the back entrance. 
Jack Chloe, step away from the computer. Now 
Tony locked me in here Saunders has Michelle, he's using her as leverage to get his daughter out. 
Don't move Security, this is Jack Bauer I need a 20 on Tony Almeida I repeat, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida Negative, Jack He's not on any of the monitors. 
When did he lock you in here? 
About 2 minutes ago Have security lock down the entire building Adam, I want every SAT within range trained on us. 
I want to know everything that's exiting this building Who's watching Jane Saunders? 
Both guards are down, she's gone Tony Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida This is Almeida. We are out. I have got her 
How long until satellite finds you? 
About 30 minutes I will give you further instructions in 20 minutes. 
Be at the northeast corner of Taylor and Vine. 
Yeah, right. 
Tony, its me. We have a problem. 
We just determined a man who was exposed to the virus got out of the hotel Son of a bitch. Howd that happen? 
He must have slipped out right before we reinforced the perimeter. 
Its likely he had no idea had been exposed. 
If we dont find this guy before he becomes symptomatic, we might be looking at an outbreak. 
What do you want? 
To give you your next assignment. 
There is a man named Ryan Chappelle, regional director of CTU. 
I want him killed. 
This man Saunders has proven that he will use this virus to inflict mass casualties if you dont do what he says. 
How long am I supposed to let him hold this country hostage? 
Until we catch him. 
Saunders called in with another demand. 
What does he want now? 
He wants you killed. 
Hes threatened to release the virus into the main population unless we deliver your body by 7:00 a.m. 
My god, jack He has proven he will use the virus. 
The president didn't have a choice. 
Ryan, I think we found Saunders. 
45 minutes ago he made a call from an apartment not far from here. 
Chase is leading a strike team over there now. 
Good, Jack. 
No one is here. 
Saunders, why are you doing this? 
Even if I told you, you wouldnt understand. 
A van will be arriving shortly. 
Leave Chappelles body with the driver. 
I am sorry, Ryan, we got to do this. 
Get on your knees. 
I am sorry we let you down, Ryan. 
God forgive me. 
The following takes place between 7:00 am and 8:00 am. 
He is clean. There is no tracker. 
If you try to follow us, Saunders will release the virus. 
Wayne Palmer. 
This is Jack Bauer Chappelles body has just been picked up by Saunders' people. 
Thanks Jack. 
Ryan Chappelle is dead I ordered the death of one of our agents, one of our finest. 
As unthinkable as that was, I had to buy some time in order to protect civilian lives. 
I will not cave in to any more of this terrorists demands. 
David, unfortunately we are vulnerable as long as Saunders has his virus and is willing to release it. 
So far, over 700 people have been infected, and they're all gonna die. 
Now, unless you are willing to accept more loss of life, I dont know what else we can do. 
He has us in a corner, David. 
Convene the Cabinet. 
Yes sir. 
What did you find? 
We worked up the money trails that Chappelle had on his system. 
Stephen Saunders has been sending $10000 a month to his daughter Jane. 
He has a daughter? 
Yes. Right here on the screen. 
She is 19, she lives in Santa Barbara. 
She goes to school there. 
All right, find out where she is now. 
Call Santa Barbara PD (Police Department), make sure they are on standby. 
Almeida. 
Tony, its Jack. 
Jack, what happened? 
Chappelle is dead. 
Saunders people picked up his body. 
4 men all wearing hoods, black van, no plates. 
All right, look, I will see if we can SAT track it. 
I already put Adam on it. 
Do we have any idea why Saunders wanted Chappelle dead yet? 
I was just about to call you. 
We found a thread that Chappelle was working up on his own. 
Looks like Saunders has a daughter. 
A daughter? 
Yeah, the money trail Chappelle was following leads to a Jane Saunders. 
What do we know about her? 
We are still digging up information. 
We know she is 19 years old, she goes to school in Santa Barbara. 
Is she still there? 
Yeah. I was just about to call the Santa 
Barbara office to have her picked up. 
Wait, Tony, Tony, dont. 
Thats not the right play. 
Why not? 
Think about it. 
We dont know anything about this girl. 
We dont know if she even knows who her father really is. 
And obviously Saunders is going to everything he can to protect his daughter. 
So someone is watching her. 
If you want to grab her for questioning, you are going to have to do it without him knowing. 
Which means we have to conduct a plain sight swap, switch her out with one of our own agents. 
Jack, I dont know that we have the time. 
We are going to have to find an agent that looks like the girl within the next half hour. 
Right now Saunders is calling all the shots. 
If we dont do something soon, we are going to be completely paralyzed. 
All right, I will get started. 
Chloe, we need to find a Jan Saunders look alike. 
I need you to abstract a physical description cross referencing with our CTU agents in regions 2 and 3. 
Ok, when do you need it? 
Right now. 
I just started the file on her. 
Chloe, just do it for me, please. 
Dessler. 
Hey, its me. 
Did you get the test results? 
I wont know if I am infected for another hour. 
Whats taking so long? 
They couldnt interpret the result here. 
They had to send everything back to the lab. 
How are you feeling? 
I am, I think I am ok. 
No nose bleeds? 
Nothing on your skin? 
No. 
Look, NHS has everything under control here. 
I want to keep busy. 
How can I help? 
Adam is working on a citywide containment. 
I will have him split off some of his workload on your system. 
Open a socket, you can help with NHS deployment. 
I will call you later, ok? 
Yeah, ok. 
Michelle is still at the hotel. 
I just told her youd send over some of your system updates for her to work on. 
Ok, I will send them right over. 
Where are we on this guy who escaped from the hotel? 
His name is Bill Cole, he is an insurance sales rep. 
We contacted his wife by phone, but she wasnt being very cooperative. 
We did manage to get from her that Cole came home unusually late and left early. 
For work? 
Probably, but his office doesnt open for another half hour, so we are looking for him now. 
NHS has just arrived and they will quarantine the house and test the wife. 
Who are we sending over there? 
Chase. He will be there soon. 
Agent Bauer, I have the President for you. 
Patch him through. 
Jack Mr. President 
Stephen Saunders, the man who is in control of the virus, you know him, correct? 
Yes sir. I worked with him a number of 
years ago on a mission that you sanctioned. 
The Drazen mission in Kosovo. 
The last conversation I had with him, he said there would be other demands. 
His exact words: the main event to come. 
You have any idea what he means by that? 
I wish I could tell you, sir. 
Right now Stephen Saunders is in a vengeful state of mind. 
Any demands that he makes will be detrimental to American security. 
What I am asking, Jack, is what will he do if I say no to him? 
Mr. President, when I worked with Stephen Saunders, 
I never thought he was capable of mass murder. 
Today we know he is. 
He still has the virus. 
If you dont meet his demands, sir, I believe that he will continue to release it. 
Thank you, Jack. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Here is the list you wanted of the top ten agents that could double as Jane Saunders. 
None of these are in Los Angeles. 
I know. The closest is CTU San Francisco. 
Did you put together a 2nd tier list? 
Yeah. 
You sure this is right? 
Yeah, I double checked when I saw the results. 
Kim Bauer. 
Yeah, Kim, could you come up to my office, please Sure. 
Thanks. 
You are not thinking of using her? 
We dont have a choice. 
Shouldnt you talk to Jack first? 
Chloe, I will take care of it, all right? Thank you. 
Why dont you sit down. 
Ok. 
Kim, we need to question Jane Saunders without her father knowing about it. 
The problem is, we are pretty sure he has somebody watching her. 
Fine. What do you need me to do? 
Well, you are the same age, similar body types, your facial fertures are different, but no so different that we couldnt disguise it from a distance. 
You want me to pose as Jan Saunders. 
Well, we have better matches, but they are too far away from this office. 
So, the bottom line is, you are our best chance. 
Now, we dont have much time. 
We are still in the early stages of planning this mission, but if all goes according to plan, it shouldnt be too dangerous. 
No, I am not going to order you to do this. 
I know, and I know whats been going on today. 
And if you had a better option, I know youd take it So, I am fine and I will do it. 
You sure? 
Positive Chloe, I am leaving for Santa Barbara in a few minutes, so you are going to need to transfer all my stuff onto your system. 
I know everything thats happening, I already pulled your data. 
Good. 
I think its only fair that I tell you. 
I told Tony I didnt think you should do this. 
Field work isnt learn as you go. 
I am not doing this to be a field agent, Chloe, there is no one else. 
Yeah, thats why I didnt fight Tony harder. 
Not that he would listen to me anyway. 
I am not so out of it that I dont know he doesnt respect my opinions on tactical matters. 
Ok, look, I have to go. 
Ok, I just wanted to let you know how I felt, and I want you to know that I am behind 110% I really hope nothing bad happens to you. 
Listen, Chloe, are you coordinating this operation from inside? 
Of course. 
Ok, maybe you should start prepping, because I bet there is about 2 dozen agents still waiting for comm. Codes. 
I like your energy, Kim. Use it. 
Adam, could you send me a list of all the personnel working on the Jan Saunders operation? 
I cant do it right now, Chloe, I am monitoring Chase. 
Did he find Bill Cole? 
Not yet, he is interrogating Coles wife. 
This thing is out of control. 
I already told the people on the phone that Bill isnt here. 
I know, I know, but when he was here, did you notice anything out of the ordinary? 
Was he bleeding from the nose for instance? 
No, not that I saw. 
What about rashes, skin irritation, anything of that sort? 
No. Why would you think that hed be sick? 
He came in contact with some people who are sick at the Chandler Plaza Hotel. 
When was he at the Chandler Plaza? 
Earlier this morning. 
No, no, he wasnt. 
He was with a client at the office. 
He did it again, didnt he? 
That bastard did it again. 
Maam Then I hope he did get something. 
I hope that he dies. 
Please, Mrs. Cole, I need you 
Get out of here. Get out of my way. 
Mrs. Cole 
Get out of my way Mrs. Cole, you need to stay calm, 
because I cant let you leave. 
Agent Edmunds Yeah One of my men just found this. 
Where? 
Wastebasket in the bathroom. 
Blood is tacky, which means its fresh. 
Then Bill Cole is symptomatic. 
Yeah. 
I need you to contact every urgent care facility in a 30 mile radius. 
Yes sir. 
Excuse me. 
I have had a nose bleed for about an hour. 
I cant seem to stop it. 
Did you put ice on it? 
Yeah. Didnt do anything. 
Try an ER, get it cauterized. 
That will take too long. 
I got to go to work. 
We dont have anything here that will stop that. 
All right. Thanks. 
Excuse me. 
The swap will take place at the campus library. 
She works there in the mornings. 
This is a file of relevant personal data. 
All right. 
Chloe, where is Tony? 
He is in the teleconference room with Kim. 
Why isn��t she working the satellite track with you? 
Uh, you might want to talk to Tony about that. 
When you get into the position, just act naturally Try to look up a place. 
Hey, Jack. 
What are you doing with Kim? 
Chloe came over a list of potential matches for Jan Sanders. 
Good, so we have got one? 
Well, you are not going to like it. 
It��s Kim. 
My Kim? 
I am not crazy about it either, but she is the only one that matched both physically and geographically. 
You are not sending her into the field. 
She can handle it, plus she has a safety net. 
Find someone else, Tony. 
Jack, you said yourself, we need to get Saunder��s daughter without him knowing. 
Kim is our best shot at doing that. 
She is not doing it. 
It��s not up to you, it��s her decision. 
Fine. 
I will order her not to do it. 
She doesn��t work for you, Jack She works for me Don��t... 
Dad Get out of here. 
Please don��t do this, please Get out of here now. 
Or I will throw you out myself. Move 
Jack You talk it over with your father. 
If we have to abort this, I want to know now. 
I will be outside. 
I know you think you are doing the right thing, but this is not going to happen. 
Somebody has to do it. 
Someone will, not you I am the best match You are not a field operative I have weapons training. 
This is decoy work. 
Saunders�� people won��t even come close to me. 
Kim, you don��t know what you are talking about. 
If everything was to go right in this scenario, which is not a chance I am willing to take You are not taking it, I am The reason why you have got this job, the reason why I gave you this job is so that I an make sure you��d be safe. 
I took this job because I wanted it, not because you wanted me here. 
I know that this is hard for you, but this is not your decision. 
This is my job, better yet, my duty. 
I am going to be safe, but I am doing it. 
They are ready to go All set Ok, now as soon as we get there, they are going to deal with your hair and makeup. 
Remember, we are not trying to fool anyone at close range. 
You will be in a position where Saunders�� people can only view you from a distance. 
Yeah. 
Is your comm. 
unit getting a clear signal? 
Oh, it��s fine. 
Kim Yeah? 
This is a gun I got for you. 
I don��t think you are going to have to use it, but if you do, don��t hesitate. 
Ok Come on, let��s go Please be seated. 
Thank you for assembling on short notice. 
You have already been briefed on the Cordilla Virus that��s now threatening our cities. 
What you don��t know is we have 2 new developments. 
Wayne. 
First, a vial of that virus has already been release. 
The Chandler Plaza Hotel, here in Los Angeles, was the site of the first attack. 
That situation is being addressed. 
Secondly, we discovered the identity of the perpetrator. 
His name is Stephen Saunders and he is a former MI6 agent. 
Now, apparently, Mr. Saunders has at least 11 more vials and 
is threatening to release them unless we meet his demands. 
Mr. President, what are those demands? 
So far there have been 2. 
The first was for the President to use the phrase ��the sky is falling�� in a press conference. 
He then demanded that we terminate one of our own agents. 
One of our agents? Why? 
Well, we are still looking into that. 
What was his response when you didn��t comply? 
It devastates me to tell you that I had no choice but to comply. 
A half hour ago, we delivered this agent��s body to one of Saunders�� representatives. 
My God. 
Millions of lives are at stake. 
I am going to need each of your departments to open your files to CTU Los Angeles. 
Give them whatever they need. 
Tony, I am trying to get into some DOD files for Jack, I need authorization from Cahppelle. 
When is he going to be back? 
He is not. 
What do you mean? 
Could I have everybody��s attention, please? 
I am sorry to tell you that, Ryan Chappelle was killed in the line of duty about a half an hour ago. 
I can��t give you any more details, but I will be assuming Ryan��s responsibilities until we hear from Brad Hammond at division. 
Now, there will be an opportunity to pay proper respects to Ryan, but now is not the time. 
Tony, it��s Chase on line 5. 
Thanks Almeida. 
Yeah, it��s me. 
I am at Cole��s house. 
We found evidence he is almost certainly symptomatic. 
All right, how many people did he come in contact with over there? 
Just his wife. 
NHS is moving her into isolation right now. 
All right, I will let the teams know. 
Tony, transfer me to Kim. 
She was running a simulation for me. 
Yeah, I gave that to Adam. 
Kim is out on assignment right now. 
What kind of assignment? 
Well, we are pretty sure that Saunders has his daughter under surveillance, so Kim is gonna take her place when we grab her. 
Kim is not a field ops What the hell is she doing out there I don��t want to hear about it, chase, all right? 
Kim was the only match we had available. 
Tony, there is got to be other agents you can use for this. 
What the hell are you thinking? 
No, there aren��t Back off, Chase Where is she now? 
She is on her way to Santa Barbara with Jack. 
Jack signed off on this? 
First of all, it��s my call. 
Secondly, yes, Jack did, but most importantly, Kim accepted the assignment. 
Now, I am gonna transfer you over to Adam. 
Fine. 
Look, I am sorry about what happened earlier about grabbing you. 
I didn��t mean to scare you. 
I just don��t think what you are doing is right. 
But I need you to understand something in the field I am in command. 
You do what I tell you to do. 
Do you understand me? 
Do you understand me?? 
Yes Ok, good My nose has been bleeding for almost an hour, and I can��t get it to stop. 
All right. 
Have a seat and fill this out. 
How long will that take? 
There are a couple patients ahead of you, it shouldn��t be too long Thanks TV: As to how serious this illness is, we have no new information and the authorities are not commenting. 
We can��t verify this but we are hearing that whatever is infecting the people of this hotel, it��s very serious and possibly deadly. 
Body bags have been spotted, and rescue workers are positioned around the Chandler Plaza. 
Authority do not give any information regarding the estimated... 
Hey One minute, sir. 
No, now. 
I need to see a doctor now. 
I was at that hotel. There is 
something seriously wrong with me Oh, my god, you are him Dr. Joyner. 
The man we are supposed to isolate, he is here Yes We have just identified the body And it��s Chappelle? 
It's confirmed. The thumbprint 
matched the one in his file. 
Good. 
Dump the body. 
Yes, sir. 
You take care of your problem? 
Yes, Chappelle is dead. 
But CTU is still gonna try to find out what he was working up, so tell Lennox to stay alert, make sure he doesn��t let Jan out of his sight. 
Yeah Any problems? 
No. She is leaving her apartment now. 
She is going to work. 
All right, stay with her. 
The next few hours are crucial. 
I will be here. 
Mr. President, we have started down a 
slippery slope here, and unless we are Cut the euphemisms, Jeseph. 
What are you trying to say? 
Sir, we are concerned about the fact that you ordered the death of a high ranking member of our intelligence I don��t think we are here to second guess actions that have already been taken. 
Joseph, no one is more aware than I am of the moral ambiguity of my decision. 
I did it to buy CTU more time to find Saunders and to delay for as long as possible the slaughter of millions. 
I made the decision to protect their future not mine Saunders. 
I have to take this. 
Yes I have confirmed the identity of Chappelle��s body, Mr. President. 
It will be disposed of respectfully. 
We know who you are, Mr. Saunders. 
Whatever you are trying to accomplish, you are going to fail. 
Your only chance is to relinquish the virus and hope we don��t find you. 
That��s not going to happen. 
What is it you want? 
To make America clean again. 
You see, Mr. President 
the world hates America and for good reason I won��t bother going into the details, you know better than I the atrocities your nation commits. 
But we are going to change all that. 
You and I, together, are going to dismantle the military machine that exports its ugliness across the globe. 
And how are we going to do that? 
We will start where the work gets the dirtiest, something I know a little about. 
Covert foreign nationals. 
In 32 countries across the Middle East and Asia, your government employs grade A through H intelligence consultants. 
They are citizens of the countries in which they reside. 
They are spies Working against those countries at the behest of the American military machine. 
In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities sent to me by way of a web site Sylviaimports.com 
If you fail to cmply, I will release 2 vials of the virus in major cities. 
And this time, they won��t be in hotels where they can be contained. 
Agent Bauer, Rachel Forrester. 
This is Agent Kim Bauer. She is 
gonna be doubling for Jana Saunders. 
We have already set up a staging area outside the library where she works Is it a safe distance away? 
Yes, we won��t be detected. 
Is she there yet? 
No. She will be in a few minutes. 
Let��s go ahead. Let��s go. 
Make sure everybody on the block is contacted and nobody leaves their house. 
Sheriff��s department is sending officers over to patrol a 3 block area until they get here. 
Use your men. Excuse me. 
Excuse me. 
Edmunds. 
Yeah, we found Bill Cole. 
 Where? 
 He is at an urgent care center not far from you. 
Laurel Canyon and Moorpark Yeah, I know where that is. 
I want you to get over there, get as much as you can off of Cole. 
He is pretty agitated, you are gonna have to help him focus. 
Tony Yeah Is Kim in play yet? 
No. She just landed in Santa Barbara. 
All right, I will call you. 
Where is Jane now? 
My people have her under surveillance in the library working behind the reference desk. 
How crowded? 
10, 20 people Well, one of them belongs to Saunders, and their orders are gonna be not let her out of their sight, not for one second. 
I know. We have taken over 
the surveillance cameras and we have narrowed down a list to about 5 probables. 
Ok, get that intel over to Tony Almeida at CTU. 
Ok, let��s see her. 
Ok, now remember, Kim You are not gonna fool anyone who knows Jane Saunders up close. 
I know The staff knows what��s happening But I want you to stay at least 10 feet behind the counter, and I want you to keep your head down as much as possible. 
the wig looks darker than Jan��s hair color. 
That��s the best we could do on such short notice. 
You are gonna have to match every detail as closely as possible, her life depends on it. 
Mr. Cole, when you were inside the 
store, who did you come in contact with? 
What do you mean, contact? 
Who did you talk to? 
Just the pharmacist behind the counter. 
How many others? 
Customers? 
Yeah, there were some other people there. 
How many other people were there? 
Bill If we do not identify and track down everyone you have come in contact with, we are gonna have a citywide epidemic. 
So how many people? 
I, I don��t know Think! 
That��s it. We are now patched 
against security. 
No audio from the system Nothing on B Go ahead, try six This screen go ahead isolate front desk 5 is good Thank You Oh I am so sorry You are not supposed to have drinks in here. 
I am sorry, I will throw it away. 
It��s ok Start tracking that man in the red shirt. 
I want to know everything that he does. 
Yes Sir. 
Subject is on camera 4 right now. 
I was just about to replace those. 
Here you go. 
Clear What the hell is taking her so long? 
Checking all surveillances now Nothing on 1, nothing on 2 Come on Sir, she came out from 4 Kim There is a man handing towards the bookcase at your 3 o��clock, red shirt Might be one of Saunders�� men. 
I want you to angle away from him slowly. 
Good We just got off the phone with Chase who is with Cole right now. 
After Cole left the hotel, he went to his house in Burbank. 
He stopped at a gas station on Riverside Drive But it was self service and according to what he told the urgent care unit what his wife confirmed, he didn��t become symptomatic until after he got home. 
The nose bleeds and the sweating? 
Right Here is where the ripple effect starts. 
At 7:20, he stopped at a pharmacy and asked the pharmacist Sam Tyler for some medication to stoop the bleeding There were 3 other people inside that pharmacy at the same time Right. One of them, Anne Schwartz. 
She��s has been going to the pharmacy for years, so they had her address on file. 
We have sent NHS people to her house. 
She has a husband and 3 children. 
What about the other 2 customers? 
ID is unknown. 
These people could be anywhere, spreading the disease to anybody they come into contact with It gets worse. 
At the urgent care facility in Studio City there were 6 patients in the waiting area when cole came in, who left before the quarantine was put in place. 
We are tracking them down But between then and the staff at the facility We could be looking at up to 75 people Just in their immediate families. If any of these people 
are in a supermarket or a mall when they become symptomatic This thing is going to be impossible to contain. 
We need to identify and find them now. 
Also, I need you to coordinate with NHS and HazMat. 
We have to set up a quarantine in 2 neighborhoods in the Burbank Studio City area. 
Department heads report to Adam. 
Looks good, everybody, it looks like this worked. 
 Maintain monitering Kim. Come get me if anything happens. 
 I got it. 
Thank you, good work What��s going on? 
who are you? 
My name is Jack Bauer, I am a federal agent. 
You are not in any danger What do you want? 
We need your help We need to get in touch with your father. 
Then get in touch with him. 
What do you need me for? 
We don��t know where he is and we think you do. 
What��s this about? 
You don��t know who your father really is. 
First of all, I hardly know my father. 
And whatever this is, I know it��s illegal. 
You have no right to keep me here. 
Release me now, I haven��t done anything wrong You��d better listen to me very carefully, Jane. 
Right now your father is engaged in terrorist activity against the United States of America. 
This morning, he killed hundreds of people, and he is threatening to kill thousands more. 
Now, I can only imaging how difficult this must be for you to believe, but trust me, you are going to cooperate with us. 
There is a lot at stake, and there is not a lot of time. 
I am not going to do anything. 
I want to talk to a lawyer. 
There is no lawyer. 
There is just you and me. 
I don��t know anything about my father. 
He comes into town twice a year. 
I have dinner with him. 
I don��t even know where he lives. 
How do you contact him? 
I don��t. He calls me. 
You are lying to me, Jane. 
I��m not Don��t try to protect him. You are just 
going to get yourself in a world of trouble. 
You are the one in trouble here. 
You are the one breaking the law. 
You think I am playing a game here with you? 
Hundreds of thousands of people��s lives are on the line. 
You have no idea how far I am willing to go to acquire your cooperation. 
What are you threatening to do to me? 
Where is your father, Jane? 
I don��t know! 
Where is your father? 
Somebody, help me, pleaase Jack What? 
Red shirt is approaching her desk. 
What��s going on? 
He��s at the desk. 
Kim, don��t turn around. 
Just stay where you are. 
 Where the hell is the librarian? 
 Alice, get someone to the reference desk now Excuse me Just a minute I, I need some help with, finding a book Just one second  Ok, sweetheart, you are doing great.. 
 Jus stay calm, until we check this guy out. 
Give me a close up on the gentleman in the red shirt at the desk Can I get some help here? 
I'll be with you in a minute. 
Ok, Kim, I want you to slowly get up and try to make your way to the bookshelves in front of you. 
Stay out of his eye line until we find out who this guy is. 
 Maintain a constant visual on her from monitor 3. 
 Get camera 3 on Kim We are panning off her. 
Get me another angle. 
There is no other angle. 
 What��s going on? 
 Jack, we had her a second ago. Camera 3 should be panning back on her in few seconds 
You work here, don��t you? 
Yeah. 
 Could you help me find something in this aisle? 
 Yeah, no problem. What is it that you need? 
You call for help, I will kill you right now Who has Jan Saunders? 
Who has Jan Saunders? 
I don��t know what you are talking about. 
Where the hell is she? Kim 
Damn it Team two, go, go Get down, get down Kim Kim, step back, step back Radio back. Tell them 
the subject is down. 
Are you ok? 
Yeah, fine. 
Saunders is going to know we have his daughter. 
You have already been briefed on the Cordilla Virus that's now threatening our cities. 
A vial of that virus has already been release. 
We discovered the identity of the perpetrator. 
His name is Stephen Saunders and he is a former MI6 agent. 
In 32 countries across the Middle East and Asia, your government employs intelligence consultants. 
Theyre spies. 
In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities. 
If you fail to comply, I will release 2 vials of the virus in major cities. 
Looks like Saunders has a daughter. 
A daughter? 
We know she is 19 years old, she goes to school in Santa Barbara. 
I was just about to call the Santa Barbara office to have her picked up. 
Tony, thats not the right play. 
If you want to grab her for questioning, you are going to have to do it without him knowing, which means we have to conduct a plain sight swap. 
Switch her out with one of our own agents. 
Ok, lets see her. 
Kim, you are not going to fool anyone who knows Jan Saunders up close I know. 
Clear You think I am playing a game here with you? 
Hundreds of thousands of peoples lives are on the line. 
You have no idea how far I am willing to go to acquire your cooperation. 
Where is your father, Jane? 
I don't know. 
Could you help me find something on this aisle? 
Yeah, no problem. 
Call for help and I will kill you right now. 
Kim? 
Damn it. 
Saunders is going to know we have his daughter. 
The following takes place between 8:00 am and 9:00 am. 
These are the quarantine zones that were set up an hour ago. 
Since then, 2 new symptomatic patients were discovered at an ER in Silver Lake and one in Hancock Park. 
Those 2 cases engendered 5 new quarantine areas. 
Thats 3% of the city. 
If containment isnt total, it will grow exponentially. 
All right, thanks Adam. 
We are all tired, I know that. 
And some of you have been working for 24 hours straight. 
I dont have to tell you how serious the situation is, but we can't drift. 
If there ever was a worst case scenario, this is it. 
We are in it. 
Everyone has to stay on point. 
We have switched from prevention to containment. 
The virus is out. 
You all right? 
Yeah, I am fine. 
I am sorry it had to go down like this. 
The man I shot, is he dead? 
Yeah. 
What's going to happen now? 
Saunders is going to know we have Jane. 
This is Jack. 
Jack, its Forrester. 
The Saunders girl is calmed down. 
You can try talking to her again. 
Ok, thanks, Rachel. 
We will see what we can get from the daughter. 
I understand that, Tony. 
So you'll tell him? 
Yeah, I will tell him. 
I want every precaution taken. 
I'll get back to you. 
Yeah. 
What's going on with Jack Bauer? 
The operation wasn't completely successful. 
Now, David, they do have Saunders daughter, but they were unable to remain covert. 
So, Saunders knows we have her? 
No, not yet, but CTU is estimating he will find out within the hour. 
What's Jacks plan? 
Use Saunders daughter, try to locate him. 
David, listen. 
The deadline for his next demand is gonna be up here in about 15 minutes. 
Now, giving this guy a list of every foreign operative on our payroll is an act of treason. 
I know that. 
But he will release more of the virus if we dont. 
So what do you want to do? 
I want to see what Bauer gets out of Saunders daughter first. 
You know what just happened? 
A man who your father hired to protect you just tried to kill one of my agents. 
So, you killed him, right? 
A man that worked for my father. 
You are a smart girl, Jane. 
Look out in that room. 
Everyone here is a federal agent whose job i t is to protect the lives of American citizens. 
Jane, I know how hard it must be for you to believe everything that everybodys been telling you about your father. 
But I am going to show you something that will change your mind. 
And the sooner you stop resisting me, the sooner you can help us start saving lives. 
Why are you putting all this on me? 
Because you are Stephen Saunders daughter. 
And unfortunately, you are the only leverage we have against him. 
You cant just say these outrageous things and expect me to believe you. 
I know. 
Truth is, I know your father. 
I worked with him. 
He was a good man. 
He was a brave man. 
But something has happened to him. 
All I care about right now is stopping him from doing what he is doing. 
I can't do that without you. 
I need your help. 
Palmer still hasn't sent the list yet. 
He has 15 more minutes. 
CTU has been trying to use IP locators to get at your through the domain name. 
We've protected it though, right? 
Yes. It's a dead end 
Good. 
Thank you. 
I am going to show you who your father really is. 
These photographs were taken over 8 years ago. 
Your father told your mother that he was going to Europe on a fact finding mission. 
But the truth of the matter is, we were both part of a special forces unit that was dispatched to Kosovo to kill a man named Victor Drazen. 
This is where the mission ended, Drazens hideout. 
When I left Kosovo, I believed your father had died in the blast. 
The British government told your mother that thats where he died, too. 
But recently, we discovered through phone records that your father had contacted you 4 years ago to tell you he was still alive.Is that right? 
Yes A couple of months after my mother died, I get a call from him. 
He said he was living in Europe under an assumed name. 
And that nobody knew he was alive. 
And for his protection, I couldn't tell anyone that I had spoken to him. 
Did he ever tell you why he had contacted you after so many years? 
Yes. 
He missed me. 
I understand that. 
Over the last 3 to 4 hours, we have been pooling data from Interpol. 
Here are some more recent images. 
This is your father with Sayed Ali, a known weapon dealer in the Middle East. 
Here you see his meeting with Ari Consul, a biologist from Jakarta who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for the manufacturing of illegal biological weapons. 
This doesn't prove anything. He could have been 
meeting with these people for any number of reasons. 
I will play you an audio file, one of three that we got from your father earlier today. 
This is your father talking to the President of the United States. 
...Working against these countries at 
the behest of the American military machine. 
In 45 minutes, I want a list of their identities sent to me by way of a website, sylviaimports.com 
If you fail to comply, I will release 2 vials of the virus in major cities. 
2 more vials of the virus. 
He has already released one. 
This is a live video feed from the Chandler Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, where your father ordered the release of one if the vials of the virus into the ventilation system of the hotel. 
The people that you are looking at will all be dead within the next 2 to 3 hours. 
There is almost 800 of them,jane This is how they will die. 
I don't want to see any more. 
I don't want to see any more, either. 
You can help us stop this, Jane, please. 
Please. 
I have a phone number. 
He told me to call it day or night if I ever got in trouble. 
Have you ever used it before? 
No. 
We need it. 
No. 
No. 
It's a mistake. 
I am ok. 
I don't have any infection. 
No. Don't take me in there with those people. 
I don't want to die. 
Please. 
I don't want to die. 
Michelle, I just got a call. 
Your lab results are on the way here. 
I am sorry to interrupt, Mr. President. 
What's this? Aaron? 
Our bureau chief just informed me that NHS believes Los Angeles is no longer safe. 
We would like to move you out of the state. 
I appreciate your concern. 
Tell Chief Kurtzman, I'd rather manage matters from here. 
Sir, I am afraid this isn't a request. 
Excuse me. 
Secret service is invoking section 32. 
For your own protection, we are requiring you to accompany us to Air Force One. 
You are ordering me? 
Yes sir. It's for your safety. 
Wayne? 
I don't know the specifics of the code, but secret service is invoking it. 
And here in LA, the threat is serious. 
It's serious everywhere. 
At least here, we know what we are facing. 
Who has to sign off on this, Aaron? 
Chief Kurtzman and myself. 
I'd like a word in private with you, Aaron. 
Sir, I am sorry for appearing to overstep my bounds. 
But it's my job to protect you. 
Listen, Aaron. 
You have been with me from the beginning. 
You don't have to apologize for doing your job. 
But this crisis will end. 
And the people in this city and this country will be stronger, knowing that their president stood by them shoulder to shoulder. 
I am asking you as a friend and a fellow citizen Protect me, but here in Los Angeles. 
Can you do that for me? 
Yes, sir. For you I can. 
Thank you Yes, sir. 
Mr. President the conference call is about to begin. 
Jack, you there? 
Yeah, I am on. 
Mr. President? 
Mr. Almeida, I understand. 
We may have a way to locate this man, Stephen Saunders. 
We do, sir. However, my technical staff just informed me that 
to do this properly, it may take 15 minutes, possibly longer. 
So there is no way we can get to him in the next few minutes? 
No, sir. There's not. 
Ok, gentlemen, time is upon us. 
Having considered all the possible scenarios, I see no other choice than to draw our line in the sand. 
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand. 
Mr. President, I hope you understand 
that leaves us with only one option. 
That's to use Stephen Saunders' daughter as a hostage and hope that will stop him. 
I understand. 
All right, gentlemen, get to it. 
Yes, sir. 
David, are you sure we are doing the right thing? 
The only thing I am sure of is we can't let this country be taken over by this madman. 
Jack, how do you want to do this? 
How long do we have to keep him on the line so we can run a trace? 
About a minute. 
Ok, we need to cover our bases. 
We will use Jane to try and keep him on the line. 
If we have to jump in, we will. 
All right, look, I will initiate the trace. 
You tell Jane what we need her to do. 
I will get back to you. 
Damn it. 
What's happening? 
We have run out of time. 
We need you to call your father. 
And tell him what? 
Anything. We just want you to 
keep him on the line. 
For how long? 
At least a minute. 
Do you think you do that? 
I need to think about it. 
Jane, we don't have anymore time. 
Your father just threatened to release more of the virus in the next few minutes. 
Is the list up, yet? 
No. 
Well, his time is up. 
Yeah? 
It's me. 
Release San Francisco. 
That's my daughter's line. 
Ian, wait. 
I will call you right back. 
Find out where this is coming from. 
Jane? 
Yeah. 
Hi, Dad. 
What's wrong? 
I told you only to use this number in an emergency. 
I want to see you. I am scared. 
All the airports are shut down, and the news channels are talking about the alert level being raised. 
Just, just stay where you are, honey. 
You'll be fine. 
Someone is monitoring the call. 
Hang on a second, honey. 
Are you sure? 
Yes The signal is splitting. 
They've got her. 
Jack, we just got a hit on the trace route. 
He knows we are on the phone. 
What do I do when he gets back on? 
Nothing. You are doing great. 
Just keep talking. 
Jane. 
Yes, Dad. 
There's a man named Jack Bauer with you, isn't there? 
What, Dad? 
Hand the phone to him. 
Dad You heard me. 
I am on the line, Stephen. 
Jack, you know how many vials I have, and what I am capable of. 
And you know what I am capable of, too. 
Did you get a lock on the signal? 
It's dead. We are negative 
for passive triangulation. 
Tony, did you get him? 
We are working on it, Adam? 
I have got 2 microwaves that can give me a longitude reading, but I don't have the latitude yet. 
Here, try this. 
Adam? 
I am trying, Tony. I am working on it. 
Ok, here it is: 21904 Collins. 
We have got him, Jack. 
We will send teams from here. 
Ok. Patch the location through to the chopper. 
We will be airborne in minutes. 
Get me Chase. 
We got a location. Tell the chopper to come in. 
I want you to assemble the team. 
Take Jane back to CTU. 
I want her fully protected. 
What are you going to do to my father? 
I am going to stop him. 
I want you to go with her. 
Michelle The test results, they just came in. 
Thank you. 
Almeida Honey, it's me. 
What's going on? 
I am ok. 
I am not infected. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. They did AA swab and a 
blood test and I am going to be fine. 
I am going to be fine. 
Oh, my god. 
Oh, my god, sweetheart, that's fantastic. 
Look, I want you to get out of there right now. 
Ok? Away from anybody who's infected. 
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart. 
They said those of us that didn't come down with the infection, that we have an immunity to the virus. 
Well, where are they taking you? 
Downtown, to NHS. 
They want to keep us under watch for 18 hours. 
But they said it's just a formality. 
All right, look. I will get 
there as soon as I can, all right? 
No, no. 
Stay where you are. They need you at CTU. 
I can work from downtown. 
Honey, you don't have to work. 
We can handle it from here. 
I want to help, Tony. 
Ok Michelle Yeah I can't believe I almost lost you. 
I almost lost you, too. 
But we are still here. 
Yeah. 
I have to go. 
I will call you from NHS. 
Hey... 
I love you I love you so much. 
Excuse me, everybody, can I have your attention, please? 
The President has asked you to this informal setting without cameras or recording devices to tell you what relationship, if any the outbreak at the Chandler Plaza Hotel has with the airport closures. 
Was the Chandler Plaza the reason yellow level was raised? 
The President will deal with that in his statement. 
So Saunders knows we have his daughter. 
Yeah. 
Found out about 5 minutes ago. 
How did he react? 
He broke off communication. 
The good news is, CTU has position of Saunders, and they are sending in teams now. 
What's our confidence level? 
David, this man knows our system, our protocols. 
He is going to be tough to corner. 
Stay on top of our emergency response teams. 
The abduction of his daughter may have made things worse. 
The President of United States. 
Please be seated. 
As you know, this morning our alert level was raised to red. 
We do have information regarding a possible biological attack on American soil. 
We have maximized our preparedness across the nation. 
Now the best way for our citizens to insure their own safety is to stay home. 
If you are at work, go home. 
That's the message I hope the media can convey. 
Mr. President, we have heard reports that the local 
British intelligence office was attacjed a couple hours ago. 
Is that related? 
I can't release any details on that right now. 
I am sorry. Mr. President, the people of the 
city of Los Angeles are starting to panic. 
And information is not following from this office. 
We have had major outbreaks, we have had quarantines, and now a hint of biological terror Carol, Please No. Gerry, no. The President has 
got to be more forthcoming. 
It's ok The President has to be in control, and so do you. 
If you want to help the public and do your jobs best, sit quietly and listen to what I have to say. 
Biological agents do their worst damage where large groups of people congregate. 
The best defense we have right now is to encourage everyone to go home and stay home and await further instructions. 
Chase, it's Jack. Are you en route? 
Yeah, I am a little more than 10 minutes out. 
Jack, what are the chances Saunders knows we have his location? 
Not likely. Saunders will think he had 90 seconds more 
of talk time before we could ever lock onto this location. 
Look, I want you to move your teams into position and remind local law enforcement to stay out of sight. 
We can't tip him off. 
Done. 
Adam, I want you to keep an eye on the satellite, track anyone coming in and out of that building, and feed all that information over to local law enforcement. 
You copy? 
I am watching the data now, Jack. 
Ok, plug Chloe into it, too. 
Yeah. 
Listen, everybody, this is our time. Get it right. 
Stephen, we have to leave. 
We are not leaving. 
Why not? 
You said they probably have our location now. 
Not probably. They do. 
I don't understand. 
They have got us on satellite. 
They will pick us up if we try to leave now. 
So we sit around here and wait till they surround us? 
Exactly. 
The more bodies they send, the easier it will be for us to disappear. 
No. I am not waiting around to get caught. 
Osterlind I am leaving, Stephen. 
Yeah. 
Has she left, yet? 
No. 
She will. 
Stay on her. 
We are going to need to do this soon. 
Ok Where are we going? 
Los Angeles. 
I thought your father said there was an outbreak there. 
Where we are going, it'll be safe. Don't worry. 
Where in Los Angeles are they taking me? 
A place called CTU. 
CTU? 
Yeah. 
Counter Terrorist Unit. 
I still can't believe this. 
That my father is a terrorist. 
4 years ago, when I found out he was alive after all that time, I was so happy. 
I had a father. 
I let myself believe all that he wanted me to. 
That he was this wonderful man. 
How often did you see him? 
Couple times a year. 
Sometimes he'd surprise me. 
And he'd always bring me something And it was always perfect. 
Like he knew. 
Maybe he did know. 
What do you mean? 
He had people watching you, Jane. 
He knew more about your life than you are probably aware of. 
What am I supposed to do with all these feeling for him? 
The person I love doesn't even exist. 
What's going to happen to him? 
My dad's going to try and bring him in. 
Adam, it's Jack. 
What's the status of Saunders' location? 
I am watching it now, Jack. 
No one's left the building. 
Who's working with us? 
LAPD has set up a staging area about a block away. 
They have surrounded the area and are hidden from view. 
Ok, good work. 
Tell them I will be there in a few minutes. 
All right. 
Yeah. 
You're absolutely sure. 
Thank you very much. 
Tony, I need to talk to you. 
Yeah, just a second. 
Why don't you go ahead and put these simulations on my system. 
I need to talk to you right now. 
I will catch up. Go ahead. 
What's it? 
I have been working on the tented quarantine area, you know. 
And? 
I have been going over the list of people who have been isolated and I found a familiar name. 
And? 
One of them was Sarah Kaufman. 
Who is Sarah Kaufman? 
Adam's sister. 
You are sure it's Adam's sister? 
Yeah. She tested positive in the medical sense. 
She's going to die. 
All right, thanks. 
You are not going to tell him, are you? 
Yeah, I have to. 
But we still have a lot of work to do. 
I mean, how can he concentrate knowing that his sister gonna die in a couple hours? 
Did you ever think about that? 
Chloe, I am getting real tired of your personality. 
I am just trying to help. 
You want to help? Get back to work. 
Adam, could you come with me a second? 
I am sitting on these satellite feeds for Jack right now.Can it wait? 
No, it can't. 
Chloe will watch it. 
Fine. What is it? 
Tony, I really have to stay on this. 
It's personal. Just come with me. 
Tony, whatever it is, just tell me. 
Did I do anything wrong? 
No. 
I am afraid I have some bad news for you. 
Your sister, Sarah, is in one of the quarantine zones. 
What? 
You have a sister named Sarah, right? 
Yeah. 
But how can they be sure that it's her? 
There have to a hundred Sarah Kaufman.in Los Angeles. 
Chloe confirmed it. 
Have they kept her away from the people that are infected? 
She's infected. 
What are you saying, Tony? 
Are you telling me that Sarah's going to die? 
It looks that way, yeah. 
I am sorry. 
Oh, my god. 
Adam, I am going to give you a chance to talk to your sister, but then I am going to need you to stay on until the crisis passes. 
You think you can do that? 
Adam Because we need you here. 
Yeah. 
All right. 
No, I am completely surrounded. 
How do you know? 
There was a security guard across the street making his rounds every 15 minutes. 
He missed his last rotation, which means CTU has taken over that building. 
What are you going to do? 
I am going to wait until Bauer gets here. 
Baker and his team are running operations from behind the building. 
They will move when we tell them to. 
LAPD set up a perimeter here, here, here and here. 
We got SWAT teams moving in this way and from over here. 
Snipers on the roof. 
Nobody goes until we give the word. 
Understand? 
What's the situation? 
We have taken over building on either side of him. 
We got snipers on the roof, ready to go. 
Phones? 
We didn't jam the area.You said he'd know. 
What about infrared? 
We can't get through those walls, Jack. 
He knows we are here. 
What makes you say that? 
Because I would. 
You think he's still in there? 
Yeah. 
Why wouldn't he try to escape? 
I don't know All right, on my signal move your teams into position. 
Minimum 3 men per exit. 
Remember, no one goes into the builder till I give the order. 
We have to assume Saunders has taken defensive measures. 
Everybody ready? 
Let's go All team move into first position. 
This is a go. 
Repeat, this is a go. 
 positions all set  Let's go Stephen Saunders This is Jack Bauer. 
You are completely surrounded. 
The President is refusing to capitulate to any further demands. 
I need to remind you that we still have your daughter. 
Stephen. 
It's over. 
The only way you are getting out of this thing alive is coming through the front door with your hands on your head. 
That's not exactly true, Jack. 
Adam Not now, Chloe. I am running 
comm on the Saunders pickup. 
I know what you are doing Robin, take over Adam's screen for a minute. Come here. 
Why? Chloe, this is really not a good time. 
Tony, I need you to hear this. 
What? 
I have to report some bad news. 
Field ops lost 2 satellite feeds because Adam forgot to segregate the channels. 
What are you talking about? 
It's true. I checked your system. 
I had to reinitiate everything. 
You touched my system? 
Tony, let's face it. 
Adam shouldn't be here. 
He's under duress because his sister's going to die. 
I did not forget to separate those channels, Tony Yes, you did. 
All right, look, we don't have time for this. 
We have teams on the ground that are depending on us. 
Did you back up the satellite data? 
Yes. I reprogrammed almost everything. 
We lost about 30 seconds. 
We didn't lose it, Chloe. 
I can prove it to you right now. 
I thought that I �� Chloe is right. 
I forgot to separate them. 
All right, look. 
You made a mistake. 
But what I need to know is if can you get through the rest of the day without making another one. 
Adam? 
I'm fine, Tony. 
Ok I want you to know that I don't agree with Tony's decision. 
But since you are going to stay, I am going to double check your logs every 10 minutes in case you screw up again. 
Jack, what do you want to do? 
If he's not in there, we are wasting a lot of time we don't have. 
Just have the men maintain their position. 
This is Bauer Congratulations, Jack You found me. 
Stephen, it's over. Come on out. 
It would suit me better if you came in here and got me. 
I'd hate to be in the crosshairs of all those unstable CTU snipers. 
Come out the front door with your hands on your head. 
I assure you, you'll be fine. 
11 more vials, millions dead. 
That doesn't affect your nerves a little bit? 
The President has made himself clear. 
He's not following orders from you anymore. 
I work for him. 
Well, if that's the case, you won't mind if I take a few minutes to think things over. 
While you are thinking things over, you might want to take a second and think about your daughter. 
Tony just confirmed that he's in the building. 
All teams hold your position. 
We got confirmation. 
Is it done? 
Yes All right. Stay on the line. 
Almeida. 
Listen to me very carefully, Agent Almeida. 
Who's this? 
It's Stephen Saunders. 
Before you make any tactical errors, I'd like to give you an update on the situation. 
I'm listening. 
I need you to move to a private area that has direct comm. with your teams on site here. 
And why would I do that? 
Open a web socket to ip 257.211.16.5, 
and you will find out. 
That's ip 257.211.16.5 
Just trust me. 
Do it. 
By the way, Tony. I'd like to offer you congratulations 
on your wife eluding infection from the virus. 
How do you know about my wife? 
Get on that site. 
I don't know exactly what they are doing to her, Tony. 
But I did instruct them to leave her barely functional so that we can return her to you. 
I'll kill you, son of a bitch I will rip your dam throat out. 
You hear me? 
I am low on time, so I am sorry if I brush past that remark. 
Because in 15 seconds, Michelle will be dead if you don't do what I say. 
There are 5 agents watching the northeast exit of this building. 
4 on the ground, a sniper on the rooftop next door. 
I am assuming they are operating as a single unit. 
I want you to give them a code 9, send them to the front entrance. 
Now. 
Jack Bauer's running the operation. 
I don't have the authority to do that. 
No authority? 
Really? 
Kevin, is Michelle still conscious? 
Yes Take an eye out. 
No, wait, stop Kevin, hold for a second. 
It's gonna take me some time. 
You have 30 seconds. 
Gerry, we are talking about mass hysteria spreading out all over the place. 
Now, we are not in any position to mobilize�� It doesn't matter. 
Our position is to let the public know what is going on. 
This is Baker. 
This is Tony Almeida. 
Switch to channel 3 Go ahead We need you to code 9 your team I want you to use a controlled channel in case Saunders is listening. 
What are we doing? 
Move everyone to the front now. 
I have been monitoring all channels. 
There's nothing going on in front. 
We just got a new SAT feed that Jack doesn't have yet. 
Looks like Saunders is on the move in a blind spot. 
Get there now. 
Roger that. 4 CTU personnel 
diverting to new mark. 
No, Baker. Negative. 
No, not just CTU personnel, everyone. 
Police control included. Get there now. 
Unit 4, we have a code 9.Repeat, code 9 
Everyone to the front of the building now. 
Welcome to the first of three debates between President David Palmer, and Senator John Keeler. 
My office has just learned, that the woman with whom the President is currently involved: Dr. Anne Packard 
is being accused of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial. 
Did the President know of these accusations and choose to ignore them? 
Kim, your dad's trying to break out Salazar. 
When's the last time you heard from him? 
About half an hour ago. He asked me to 
issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar. 
 And you did it? 
 Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved. 
 But now you're telling me this isn't true. 
 No Kim, I'm sorry your dad lied to you. 
What's gonna happen to him? 
The best way out of this whole situation is to find Kyle Singer. 
Then your dad'll give up Salazar. 
What are you doing? There is 
no way out of here. 
If I die, the virus is dying with me. 
Wait! No! 
I got it, a patrol car just found the truck Kyle Singer was in. 
Hype this into the teams on stand- by. 
Assume everyone on site is contagious and use level 1 CDC protocol. 
If I get out of this thing, you're gonna have to trust me. 
 Chase! 
 What are you doing Jack? 
I've got to get Salazar in the air in that chopper in the next 60 seconds or a hundred thousand of people will die. 
You choose. 
This is Warden Mithell, I want all teams to stand down, I repeat, stand down! 
Congratulations! 
Now you are an even bigger enemy to your country than I am. 
The following takes place between 6:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M. 
Do we have enough fuel to get to Mexico? 
 We're not going to Mexico. 
 What do you mean? Why not? 
If we make a run for the border, they'll just try and force us down. 
You're gonna have to trust me. 
 Field office, O'Brian? 
 Chloe, it's Chase. 
Jack disarmed his locator but the military should have him on radar by now. 
They're feeding us the stream now Chase, I'm sending it to you. 
He just banked. 
 He's heading west towards downtown. 
 Downtown. 
He knows they can't shoot him down over a populated area. 
We may be able to override what he did to his com unit through an emergency hailing frequency. 
We have to get through to him Chloe. 
 We gotta let him know we found Kyle Singer. 
 On it. 
Major Blanchard, this is Ryan Chappelle, what's the status of your pursuit craft? 
I have 2 helicopters that have just taken off from down here. 
 How quickly will they intercept? 
 Well that's changed. 
Bauer just turned, he's no longer heading south toward us. 
Where is he heading? 
Looks like he's heading towards the city At he's current speed it will take us 10 minutes before we get within range. 
You go to force him down, even shoot him down if it comes to that. 
But we can't do that while he's over the city without incurring serious collateral damage. 
Then you have to do it before he gets to the city, if he lands, they'll be difficult to catch. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Keep this line open. 
Michelle, I'm taking over for Tony, Division wants a senior officer in charge of CTU. 
Give me an update. 
We're trying to make contact with the Chopper. 
Now that we have Kyle Singer and the virus has been contained, we need to contact Jack, let him know that the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless. 
Ok, assemble all the department heads in the conference area, I want everyone on the same page. 
What about C- Band? 
It's a SWAT chopper. 
They wouldn't be using those frequencies. 
Adam, tie up whatever you're doing, we have a briefing in the conference area in two. 
Kim, over here. 
What do you need? 
I need you to anchor this list for Chloe, while she is trying to find an admitting channel for the Chopper. 
I'm on it. 
 Sorry, I lost it in your dad's office. 
 It's ok. 
Did you tell Michelle about the drug you found in there? 
Yeah. 
 What are they gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
Everything came in right after that so no one has had time to process. 
 Send me the first 2 groups. 
 Sure. 
We'll make every attempt to communicate with Jack, trying to resolve this peacefully. 
But if we can't, I need everyone absolutely clear on this. 
Salazar's terrorist connections are a serious threat to this country. 
We cannot let him leave. 
Now that we've got Singer, should it come to it, both Salazar and Bauer are expandable. 
Why aren't we focusing on other options that would bring down the Chopper without force. 
Jack is not giving us any options. 
He's on a suicide mission either way. 
Once he hands Ramon off to Hector, they'll have no use for him, they're going to kill him. 
I just got off the phone with Major Blanchard. 
He has pursuit crafts tracking Jack. 
However if they're not able to catch him by the time he reaches his metro airspace then we have an all new set of problems. 
We need to coordinate with local authorities now. 
Hector, relax. 
Why can't I reach Gael? 
He can't get away. 
I need to know what's going on with Ramon now! 
The Government is probably releasing him, it's just taking some time. 
They're not releasing him. 
 I didn't want to tell you. 
 Tell me what? 
The plan has changed, Jack Bauer is the one who's going to deliver Ramon. 
What is that? A joke? 
 No. 
 But how is that possible? 
I mean Ramon will never accept help from the man who put him in prison. 
Oh no, he is accepting his help. 
Bauer, is now a criminal in his own country for doing this. 
Hector, what's going on? 
How could you let Bauer come to us, that's too dangerous. 
 Don't worry about it Claudia. 
 No I am worried. 
Look what he's already done to us, is that some kind of trick? 
Don't worry about Jack Bauer, I have plans for him. 
Yes? 
I don't have a lot of time, we're in the middle of this. 
 Is Ramon alive? 
 Yes, he and Bauer have escaped in a helicopter. 
 Have they contacted their pilot yet? 
 No, no, no, they're being pursued. 
Everything will be decided in the next few minutes. 
Hey, what did Chappelle say in the briefing? 
He said a lot of stuff. 
 Are they gonna try and shoot at my father? 
 If they have to, yeah. 
But if they can contact him first, it won't come to that. 
 Chloe, where are you at? 
 No progress on the hailing frequency. 
Without that we can't get through to Jack. 
Ok, here some new ones to try, use a tree search, we gotta get through that chopper. 
 Kim? 
 Yeah? 
 I need to speak to you. 
 Sure. 
Ryan and I feel you shouldn't be here, until the situation with your father is resolved. 
 I'm qualified to handle the work, Michelle. 
 Your qualifications are not an issue. 
 Your emotions are. 
 I can control my emotions. 
My father is doing this so the virus won't get out. 
If he knows that Kyle Singer is in custody, he'll give Salazar back. 
I know but we can't reach your father. 
Not yet, but Chloe and Adam are getting there, and I can help them. 
I'm a resource Michelle, don't do this. 
Ok, go back and help them. 
If we have to fire on that chopper, I want her out of here. 
What's going on? 
 It's military. 
 How can you tell? 
Their formation, their range of speed, they're gonna be on us in the next 3 to 4 minutes. 
And then what? 
As soon they got on us, they shoot us out of the sky. 
Chappelle? 
I just spoke with someone at CTU, they said you authorize to use the force against the chopper. 
That's right Chase, I did. 
Does President Palmer know about this? 
Palmer? First of all he's in the 
middle of a national debate. 
And I don't need his authorization. 
Bauer just help Ramon Salazar break out of prison. 
He did that to make sure Salazar's people don't release the virus. 
I don't care, but this is my jurisdiction. 
All I'm saying is that getting Palmer's authorization, might be the smart play here. 
Think about it. 
Jack Bauer has a personal relationship with the President. 
He saved his life more than once. 
Palmer has interceded on his behalf before. 
Our mandate does not bend to accommodate personal relationships. 
You're right Ryan. And after you shoot Jack down 
you can personally explain that to the President. 
Chappelle? 
Our aircrafts are about to make visual contact with Bauer. 
 We can be ready to fire and... 
 Do not fire! 
Repeat, do not fire until you hear back from me. 
The President has spoken of his administration support for the American worker, but I'm sure these words sounds hollow to Armando Rodriguez of Galveston, Sean Brown of Baloxi, to Kendall Taylor of Tampa, and to a hundred thousand of their fellow workers who have lost their jobs, because of trade agreement signed by President David Palmer. 
 Wayne Palmer. 
 Mr. Palmer, Ryan Chappelle call. 
Mr. Chappelle what's the latest 
on the bio- threat? 
Kyle Singer, who we believe to be the only carrier of the virus has been taken in a custody. 
Do you tell me there is no longer a risk of this virus being released? 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 Oh thank God! 
Yes, we still have the Bauer situation to deal with. 
What's the status on that? 
Bauer is taking Salazar from the prison in an helicopter, We have our men on site, but we aren't able to communicate with. 
So, what do you plan on doing? 
Salazar can't be allowed to leave the country. 
I'm afraid our only alternative is to shoot him down. 
Mr. Chappelle, my brother is not 
gonna like that alternative. 
I understand, that's why I'm calling. 
I don't want to fire on Bauer without the President permission. 
Yeah, well the President is in the middle of televised debate right now,  so I'm sorry but this is gonna have to wait. 
 It can't wait. 
In a few minutes, their helicopter's going to be over downtown LA, and we will be unable to shoot it down without risking significant civilian casualties. 
 I'm gonna get back to you alright? 
 Soon Mr. Palmer. 
Otherwise Bauer will be able to land that chopper and disappear with Salazar into the population. 
Yeah. 
Senator Keeler. 
Who's the economic experts? 
The administrations? 
I, for one, cannot accept the blurred numbers being projected, by the so called economic experts of this administration. 
David it's me, the biological threat has been eliminated We have Kyle Singer in custody. 
However Jack Bauer doesn't know this and now he is facilitating Salazar escape. 
and they're in a chopper in the outskirts of the city. 
Now listen to me carefully David. 
It may be necessary to shoot him down. 
I would like to hear the President answer to that question. 
Are you prepared to authorize this? 
Mr. President, your response. 
Come on David, what do you want to do? 
I think the entire American work force would like to hear his answer. 
Mr. President? 
My fellow Americans, I have just been informed of an impending national emergency that requires my immediate attention. 
Therefore I must withdraw from this debate. 
Excuse me. 
Now what is this? 
This is to say the least an unusual situation. 
I need this room cleared. 
Get this people out of here!!! 
Help! 
Where they're taking me? 
Where do you taking me? 
Why don't you talk to me? 
Hey! What are you doing? 
Where are you going? 
What's going on? 
 Talk to me! Please! 
 Kyle, I'm doctor Duncan. 
 I need you to calm down. 
 Where is my girl friend? 
Where is Linda? 
We have here in another part of the facility. 
 Is she ok? 
 Yes, she is fine. 
There's an incubation period of 14 hours. 
With this particular virus if you haven't become symptomatic, You haven't transmitted it. 
And my parents? 
 They will be ok too? 
 Yeah. 
They're on their way. 
What happens when I do become symptomatic? 
It's like that Ebola thing, isn't it? 
It's gonna eat me alive? 
We'll keep you has comfortable has possible. 
Alpha 1, Zebra 1, we have visual. 
They've got us. 
They've locked onto our heat signature. 
 Then, why aren't they firing? 
 I don't know. 
Chloe! Come one, give me the hailing frequency! 
I can't make the servers go any faster, OK! 
Mr. Chappelle we've just locked on to the chopper. 
It is not yet over a populated zone. 
I need an answer. 
How much time do we have precisely? 
Before collateral damage becomes an issue, Mr. we've 4 minutes. 
Stay on course Major, I'm waiting to hear back from the President. 
We still haven't got any indication as to the nature of this national emergency. 
And Senator Keeler's staff is questioning whether or not this emergency actually exists. 
If this indeed is a national emergency of any sort, it would challenge the nation at this critical time. 
Could you give us a moment please? 
David, I'm sorry but we don't have a lot of time here. 
So what do you wanna do about shooting down this chopper? 
 I can't give the order to kill Jack Bauer. 
 But you can't let Salazar go either. 
Is this Salazar you're worried about? 
Or you worry that if Jack Bauer lives, he'll talk about our arrangement. 
It's a fair question to be blunt, yeah I'm worried about that, even if you're not. 
But you still have to think about national security David. 
I mean Salazar not only runs a drug cartel, but he's connected to terrorist organizations. 
And he has proven to us today that he has the infrastructure to launch a biological attack on our soil. 
How we can allow him to do that again? 
Jack Bauer sacrificed everything to prevent that attack. 
Jack Bauer volunteered. 
Jack Bauer knew the risks, now David you have got to make this decision as if that wasn't Jack Bauer on that helicopter. 
You have to do what's right for this country David. 
Listen. 
This is your call. 
But you gonna make it now. 
Get me Chappelle. 
We now have just over one minute until they reach the no fire zone. 
 I repeat, we have over just... 
 Hold on Major. 
 Ryan Chappelle? 
 This is President Palmer. 
Why can't you force down that chopper without firing it? 
Bauer won't communicate with us Mr. President, he's forcing our hand. 
How much time do we have? 
In 60 seconds he'll be out of reach. 
Sir? 
You have my authorization to fire. 
Yes, Sir. 
 Major, shoot him down. 
 Yes, Sir. 
This is Alpha 1 to Zebra 1 and Zebra 2. 
Proceed, you have a go, I repeat, you have a go. 
Roger that Alpha 1, preparing to launch. 
Damn it! What's happening? 
They gave the order. 
No please. 
?? 6 do you copy? I don't have a shot. 
He's changing course, get under, get under! 
Do you have a shot? 
Negative, negative. He knows where I am. 
He knows you're in the way. 
 I've got him again. Rocket's engaged. 
 You're clear for shot. 
Target locked. I'm taking the shot. 
Hold fire, hold fire, standby. 
Alpha 1, he's reaching downtown. 
Please advise, do we still fire? 
No, stand down, I repeat, do not fire, do not fire. 
Roger that Alpha 1, standing down Hold on we're going in. 
All right! Everyone! 
Fall back to B protocols. 
Have all units on the ground and prepared. 
Wherever Bauer lands, I wanna be on top. 
 Dessler? 
 Michelle, what's going on? 
They're not firing. 
He takes over the city. 
Can you get him on the hailing frequency yet? 
Chloe is getting close. 
Ok, he's putting it down, I gotta go. 
Get me to Chloe! 
Get me to Chloe! 
Yeah? 
Chloe? 
Chloe? 
Any seconds left Chase? 
There is no time damn it! 
I need to get through before he lands. 
I got it Chase, I got it. 
Patching you through, you're in, go. 
Jack, we found Kyle Singer. 
I repeat, we found Kyle Singer. 
The virus is contained. 
No need for you to doing this. 
Mr. and Ms. Singer, 
I'm Doctor Duncan. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
One more second. 
That's good. 
Get this. 
But our options of retrievement are limited. 
I don't understand. 
If he's not sick yet, why isn't there any way to treat him? 
Once someone is exposed and starts incubating the virus, there is nothing we can do. 
So, how long does he have? 
The lab tests haven't come back yet,  once we do we'll have a more... 
 Please! Just give me some idea. 
Hours, not days. 
I'm sorry. 
 Can we see him? 
 Of course. 
 Come on honey. 
 I can't! I can't! 
Hey, Helen he needs to know that we're not angry with him. 
Kyle? Your parents would 
like to speak with you. 
They can hear you through the intercom. 
Take your time, I'll be just outside. 
 The doctor told us everything. 
 But maybe they're wrong! 
Maybe it isn't as bad as they think. 
They're not wrong. 
I deserve what I'm getting. 
Don't say that, all you deserve is a father who could do better for you, so you wouldn't have to go and get money and bring it home because i couldn't. 
I'm sorry, Kyle, I'm so sorry. 
I love you. 
You've always taking care of me. 
Now I've never... 
now I've never told you this. 
But you made me feel safe. 
Even now... 
you make me feel safe. 
You did the best you could dad. 
I will die. 
 I will die. 
 No, no. 
Edmunds, CTU, anybody seen him. 
Witnesses saw your suspects run down at to the station over 5 minutes ago. 
 How many trains have left? 
 Two. 
One made a stop 10 blocks east of here. 
We got officers searching that area. 
We stopped another train in the tunnel, they're searching it now. 
Jack's not gonna let himself be trapped in a train. 
You think he's still down the tunnel. 
CTU, Bauer? 
Kim I need the entire schematic of the Pershing Square station. 
What's going on Chase? 
Your dad got out of the Chopper before I can tell about Kyle Singer, he and Salazar are on the run. 
Hang on, ok I've got the schematics. 
How many tunnels emergency access are their between here and Grant. 
Heuuu? 
 Kim? 
 I'm looking. 
Come on, let's go. 
There is one, in the alley. 
Just off 6th street south- west corner. 
How far is that from here? 
One block, but they are one ways so you'll be better off on foot. 
Ok, I'll get back to you. 
Hey! Are we coordinating with you guys or not? 
Michelle, I just get off the phone with Chase, he's at the metro station. 
 What did he want? 
 Information about the subways. 
Whatever you gave him, copy to all other agents. 
 I did. 
 Good. 
They know not to use lethal force, right? 
Mandate is the same. 
Stop Salazar by any means necessary. 
But now that they're on the ground, they can probably do that without harming your father. 
Right. 
Dessler? 
Michelle, it's Chase, Jack got out of a tunnel to a maintenance access of mission (?? ) 
the 900 block, you need to redeploy all your people this area. 
 seal off a 10 block radius. 
 I'm on it. 
Come on, get in. 
The exit of the President did come at a critical time of the debate and even pondered?? on both side of the isle 
are speculating that it is quite odd, to say the least, Yeah, I will. 
I will tell him, thanks. 
It was CTU. 
They still haven't found Bauer or Salazar. 
LAPD is placing an?? area 
where the Chopper landed. 
Hopefully they'll be picked up without an incident. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, it's probably more likely that Bauer sneaked through. 
David, listen. 
You gonna have to stop thinking about his welfare for the moment. 
That Bauer breaking Salazar out of prison has already leaked to the press. 
Now you gonna have to go out there, and explain to them that's why you ended this debate. 
And then explicitly denounce what Bauer did. 
So Jack puts his life on the line to stop the fire so we hang him out dry. 
David we cannot allow anyone to know that we sanctionned what he did. 
That would do irreparable damage to you, to the office. 
Now you know what I'm saying is true. 
No sorry but you gonna have to let him go. 
Who are you calling? 
The pilot. 
Your brother gave the FBI contact instructions in his last call, he's got a plane circling waiting to pick you up. 
So CTU knows about the plane. 
Would that be a problem? 
Not for a long. 
Yes? 
Yes, this is Jack Bauer, I've got Salazar. 
I'm on a secure cell: 7, 1, 1, *, 6, 5, 5, 9. 
Reconfigure your frequency and call me back. 
 I get confirmation. 
 That's right. 
 Is this the real thing? 
 Yes. 
Yes it is, he's got Salazar, call him back and make arrangements. 
And you'll buffer from CTU. 
It's handled. 
Yeah? 
Where are you? 
2700 block of Figerow. We're heading south. 
All right, the closest safe airstrip is Santa Margarita. 
Do you know where that is? 
Yeah, I can get there in about 10 minutes. 
You really are the best Jack. 
When you were down there with us I had no idea your were an agent. 
We accepted you. 
You didn't have to put the needle in your arm. 
You did that for other reasons. 
Same reason as all junkies, to kill the pain. 
What's your pain Jack? 
What does the needle make go away? 
Make sure to call Division, tell them that they need to move their men out of Downey. 
 Same place? 
 Yeah, we need everyone downtown. 
Michelle Dr. Linzer on line 3. 
It will take a few minutes, is that all right? 
 Yeah call me back with confirmation. 
 All right. 
 Yeah Doctor? 
 Well, your husband is out of surgery. 
How is he? 
Their was no nerve damaged, the injury was entirely vascular. 
It's what we're hoping for, right? 
Yes. 
He should recover fully. 
Thank God! 
Now, he is going in a post- op now so he should be awake in the next hour or so. 
I'll be there. 
Thank you. 
Thank you Doctor. 
It was the hospital. 
Tony is gonna be ok. 
That's good news. 
Thank you Ryan. 
Have you heard back from INS? 
Yeah we send out an alert. 
And we cover from Baha to New- Mexico. 
How about local airfields? 
We're trying to shutdown everything we can but, we're getting a little bogged down with the FAA. 
Have Gael run a pattern analysis on local air traffic, we may come up with an anomaly. 
It's a good idea. 
 Kaufman? 
 Adam, where's Gael? 
Hmmmm, Tech. 1. 
Kim and I are just about to head down there, do you need me to tell him something? 
 No, just send him over to my office  Ok. 
 I'll let him know. 
 Thanks. 
Once you get back in the air I'll be offline. 
You comute your frequency every 15 minutes, I'll pick you up in 22. 7. 
Roger that. 
I'll get back to you. 
So everything on the system hasn't been updated since 11am. 
So that's where you should start. 
Ok. 
Gael? 
Michelle needs to see you in her office. 
Ok. 
 You can use the station right here. 
 Great. 
What are you doing? 
Ah, bringing the logs back up to date, we got really behind when everything hit the fan today. 
I can do that a lot faster than she can. 
No, Michelle needs to see you now. 
Ok. 
 You're all set. 
 Great. 
 See you in a bit. 
 Yeah. 
Sir? 
 Can you give me a moment? 
 Yeah. 
Have these 2 paragraphs inverted. 
And have the secretary meeti me in the morning. 
 All right? 
 Yes sir. 
Is everything ok? 
No we had to make some fast choices and I couldn't do that while I was on stage. 
Yes. 
 Everything is ok now. 
 Are you sure? 
This is just damage control. 
David I'm sorry, I just... 
I still can't believe Keeler would repeat those lies in a national debate. 
You don't have to apologize for anything. 
You didn't sink to their level. 
And in the long run, it's gonna pay off. 
I hope you're right. 
But I'm more concerned about you. 
You've only been brought into this because of me. 
I'm fine. 
Yes, you are. 
David, Jerry has scheduled a press conference. 
They're expecting a statement this evening. 
Fine. 
We've got to get right on a response to Keeler's accusation about Anne. 
What did the quick post tell us? 
Well I'm not gonna lie to you. 
We got hit hard. 
Voters who are on a fence may have just fall into Keeler's camp. 
But that is ridiculous once they'll find out that Ted was lying. 
But how are they supposed to do that Anne? 
I mean it's he said, she said, see this is politics, it's not medicine, so do me a favor and stay out of it. 
Stay out of it? 
I am it! 
That's enough. 
Wayne, you gonna have to be patient. 
Anne's not going anywhere, and we are not changing our strategy. 
 David we really... 
 Right now, it's Mr. President. 
Yes, Sir. Mr. President. 
I may not agree with his bedside manner, but I think he's right. 
You don't need this right now. 
Now, what are you saying? 
I think we should put our relationship on hold until after the election. 
Wow, wow, first of all, that won't resolve anything, and second of all, I need you. 
Then I'm right here. 
That's my lady. 
Wait a minute. 
How can that be? 
 Have we rechecked these results? 
 3 times Doctor. 
 You're sure? 
 Very sure. 
Ok, thanks. 
Yeah, get me Chappelle at CTU, put him through to my cell. 
What's going on? 
There is no trace of the virus in your blood. 
What? 
We've rerun the tests several times, and have them double checked in another lab. 
You're clean. 
Ohh! My God! 
 Duncan? 
 Nicole? Chappelle. 
Kyle Singer's tests came back negative. 
How is that possible? 
It's only possible if he was never infected. 
So you're telling me this whole virus scare was a bluff? 
Hard enough I'd say that. 
That dead body they dropped off this morning, was definitely infected. 
Then why wouldn't have infected the boy? 
What the hell is going on here? 
I don't know, you tell me. 
What the hell is going on? 
You didn't think I was gonna let you just deliver me and leave, did you? 
Get him off. 
Ramon! 
What the hell is going on Ramon? 
 Thanks for the ride Jack. 
 Ramon! 
Hector said to bring him back, alive. 
Fine. 
Let's go. 
Adam! 
Adam, there is something seriously wrong. 
I've just remembered. 
I forgot to close that file.
